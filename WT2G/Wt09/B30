<blockquote>
Although it is true that <i>mens rea</i> in the sense of one state of mind required for all forms of criminal responsibility does not exist, and that instead there are only a number of <i>mentes reae</i> varying from crime to crime and from material element to material element, the maxim <i>actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea</i> is still of paramount importance. It serves as a reminder of the moral nature of the criminal law and also offers an ideal
against which particular rules of that law can be measured.

<p><br>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

The Supreme Court of Canada released its most recent package of decisions concerning the constitutional requirement of fault in September 1993.<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup> In those decisions, the Court confirms
earlier <i>dicta</i> that, in all but a very few crimes, the minimum fault level required by the <cite>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite><sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup> will be based on an objective
standard. The Court continues to derive its analysis from a doctrine first articulated in <cite>R. v. Vaillancourt</cite><sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup> and later developed in <cite>R. v. Martineau</cite>.<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup> This doctrine relies on the notion of stigma as determinative of the constitutionally required level of fault under s. 7 of the Charter.
<p>
These decisions mark the latest pronouncements in the Court's review of the constitutional requirement for a mental element in criminal offences, a process which began in 1985 with <cite>Reference re Section 94(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act</cite>.<sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup> In the <cite>Motor Vehicle Reference</cite>, the Court rejected absolute liability as a fault standard for any offence where there is a potential for a penalty of imprisonment. In doing so, the Court elevated <i>mens rea</i> to a constitutionally required element in all <cite>Criminal Code</cite><sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup> offences. 
<p>
Since the <cite>Motor Vehicle Reference</cite>, the Court has ruled that constructive murder is unconstitutional<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup> and that the principles of fundamental justice require subjective foresight in the offences of murder,<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup> attempted  murder,<sup><a href="#ten">10</a></sup> and accessory liability to an offence requiring subjective foresight,<sup><a href="#eleven">11</a></sup> due to the stigma that attaches upon conviction. On the other hand, the Court has decided that such stigma does not accompany a conviction of unlawfully causing bodily harm,<sup><a href="#twelve">12</a></sup> dangerous driving,<sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup> unlawful act
manslaughter,<sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup> failing to provide the necessaries of life,<sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup> and careless use of a firearm.<sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup> Objective foresight is the basis of liability for these offences.
<p>
The Court has continued to rely on stigma to determine the constitutionally required level of fault. Having initially
identified two factors---stigma and punishment ---as determinative of the level of fault required, the Court later states that punishment is merely a secondary consideration.<sup><a href="#seventeen">17</a></sup> The primary consideration is the stigma which attaches to an accused person upon conviction. While the analysis appeared to hold up in early and straightforward cases dealing with murder, its weaknesses have been thrown into sharp relief in later cases dealing with criminal negligence and manslaughter. In these cases, it appears that the Court, sensing that a principled application of the stigma doctrine could result in incoherence in the criminal law, has manipulated the level of stigma associated with the offences under investigation in order to reach the desired outcome. The stigma doctrine, rather than proving to be an insightful aid in carrying out the analysis, has become a hurdle which is easily overcome. Once over the hurdle, the Court is able to avoid some of the more difficult issues relating to fault in the context of a particular <cite>Criminal Code</cite> provision.
<p>
In this article, I will review the validity of the notion of stigma, assess its usefulness in determining the required degree of fault for an offence, and propose alternative grounds upon which the analysis should be based. The importance of carrying out the fault analysis in the specific context of the offence under consideration will be
emphasized. The persistence of constructive liability in the offence of unlawful act manslaughter is discussed as one example of how the stigma analysis has undermined a principled resolution of fault issues by the Court.
<p>
At a more fundamental level, I will consider whether there is a danger in attempting to constitutionalize fault using the analytical techniques the Court has employed in recent cases. In considering fault, it should be emphasized that the Court is not assessing the degree of fault which will result in the &quot;best&quot; or most desirable law from the perspective of public policy and the goals of criminal legislation. The discussion is, by the very nature of the inquiry, narrowed to focus on that degree of fault which is required as an absolute minimum to ensure that the principles of fundamental justice are not violated upon conviction. In framing the exercise in this manner, the Court recognizes some dimensions of the complexities of fault, but fails to recognize others. The resulting decontextualization of the law relating to fault may undermine some of the very principles of fundamental justice that the Court is seeking to protect.
<p>
<h3>Fundamental Justice</h3>

A. SCOPE AND CONTENT: THE <cite>MOTOR VEHICLE REFERENCE</cite>
<p>
The analysis of the constitutionally required level of fault is carried out under s. 7 of the <cite>Charter</cite>. This &quot;most eloquent but mysterious provision&quot;<sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup> states that no one is to be deprived of life, liberty, or security of the person &quot;except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.&quot; In the <cite>Motor Vehicle Reference</cite>, Lamer J. (as he then was), writing for the majority, attempted to give content and scope to the principles of fundamental justice.<sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a></sup> He undertook a purposive analysis of the term in accordance with the method established by the Court in <cite>R. v. Big M Drug Mart</cite>.<sup><a href="#twenty">20</a></sup> While rejecting any argument that such a purposive analysis could be based only on the procedural correctness of a law, Lamer J. likewise rejected a full substantive review. Steering between these two extremes, he embraced a review
which would &quot;secure for persons `the full benefit of the <cite>Charter</cite>'s  protection.'&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty1">21</a></sup> He specifically rejected equating the much broader concept of fundamental justice with the narrow, procedural protection provided by the traditional conception of natural justice.
 <p>
Lamer J. finds that the principles of fundamental justice have as their source &quot;the basic tenets and principles, not only of our judicial process, but also of the other components of our legal system.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty2">22</a></sup> They represent principles which have been recognized by the common law and are considered to be &quot;essential elements of a system for the administration of justice which is founded upon the belief in the dignity and worth of the human person and the rule of law.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty3">23</a></sup> Unfortunately, these are vague concepts which are of limited usefulness as guides for identifying in any meaningful way the principles of fundamental justice related to a specific provision of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>. However, his words allow us to discern his method in giving content to the term &quot;principles of fundamental justice&quot; as it relates to absolute liability in penal law.
<p>
In this case, Lamer J. finds that it is a principle of fundamental justice that the innocent must not be punished. To support his proposition, he relies on the common law and the work of the respected British legal scholar, Glanville Williams. He quotes from Dickson J. in <cite>R. v. Sault Ste. Marie</cite> that &quot;there is a generally held revulsion against punishing the morally innocent&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty4">24</a></sup> and goes on to hold that absolute liability is contrary to the principles of fundamental justice when the potential punishment for the offence is imprisonment.
<p>
Lamer J.'s analysis of absolute liability and fundamental justice is carried out at an abstract level, rather than in the context of the particular regulatory offence defined by s. 94 of the British Columbia <cite>Motor Vehicle Act</cite>.<sup><a href="#twenty5">25</a></sup> As Wilson J. points out in concurring reasons, Lamer J.
&quot;has relied heavily upon the common law which precluded punishment in the absence of a guilty mind.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty6">26</a></sup> However, as Wilson J. notes, this case does not deal with an offence which was part of the common law. Rather, the Court is analyzing &quot;a statutory offence as to which the legislature has stated in no uncertain terms that guilt is established by proof of the act itself.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty7">27</a></sup> Lamer J., having carried out his analysis at an abstract level, finds that any offence which combines absolute liability with the <i>potential</i> for imprisonment is unconstitutional.
<p>
Wilson J. characterizes the principles of fundamental justice as the fundamental tenets of our justice system. In determining the principle of fundamental justice at stake in the <cite>Motor Vehicle Reference</cite>, she focuses her analysis on the provision itself which combines mandatory imprisonment with absolute liability in the regulatory context. She concludes that absolute liability does not in and of itself violate the principles of fundamental justice, and then considers whether it does so when combined with mandatory imprisonment as under s. 94. She considers various theories of punishment, relying on the work of respected scholars and reform bodies, such as the Law Reform Commission of Canada, to conclude that absolute liability is only unconstitutional when it results in
mandatory imprisonment, as it does in this case.<sup><a href="#twenty8">28</a></sup>
<p>
B. A CONTEXTUALIZED APPROACH TO FUNDAMENTAL JUSTICE AND FAULT
<p>
What are we to gain from this seminal case which sets out guidelines for giving content to the principles of fundamental justice in the context of fault? I believe we can properly conclude that in defining a framework for the principles of fundamental justice, a court should look to the common law, to works of legal writers, and to law reform bodies to obtain evidence of the basic tenets of the legal system. 
<p>
Having stated that the framework for the principles of fundamental justice can be derived from these sources, it must nonetheless be acknowledged that such principles will be difficult to delineate and state in a conclusive manner. The difficulty in reducing an intricate and interactive web of principles to a number of relatively simple propositions is obvious. Indeed, it is likely that attempts by the courts to articulate such propositions will fail to
incorporate the richness and diversity of the underlying tenets of our justice system. This is a hazard inherent in the
constitutionalization of fault.
<p>
Wilson J.'s approach in the <cite>Motor Vehicle Reference</cite> is enlightening because it highlights the importance of scrutinizing the basic tenets of the justice system as they relate to fault from a perspective which focuses specifically on the issue under review. Her approach is contextual in nature and is carried out within the
close confines of the particular issue, namely the constitutionality of absolute liability combined with mandatory imprisonment in the context of a regulatory offence.
<p>
Within the framework of the fault analysis under s. 7 of the <cite>Charter</cite>, a contextual approach recognizes that different factors may assume more or less prominence depending on the offence under scrutiny. The sources alluded to earlier---the common law, academic writers, and law reform commissions---assist in identifying those
factors which are significant for each offence in order to identify the relevant principles of fundamental justice which should be considered. For example, the need for proportionality between punishment and moral blameworthiness is a recurring theme throughout the criminal law, and it is the focus of studies by academic lawyers
and law reform commissions. Since a penalty upon conviction is a common element in all offences, an assessment of proportionality should play a role in the fault analysis of all offences. 
<p>
In contrast, stigma, which is a striking feature in the offence of murder, has little relevance in other offences. Furthermore, outside the context of murder, the notion of stigma becomes conceptually uncertain. As will be discussed below, although the Court has formulated a doctrine of stigma which it has applied to the fault
analysis in all cases but one,<sup><a href="#twenty9">29</a></sup> it has not defined what stigma is, nor how it is to be assessed. Therefore, while stigma may assume a dominant role in the fault analysis for murder, it should play a minor role in relation to other offences.
<p>
A contextual approach to the fault analysis would preclude the application of factors which have little relevance to the specific offence in question. Furthermore, a contextual analysis makes it difficult for the Court to ignore features of an offence which have been recognized as anomalous in our justice system. For example, as will be seen below, the Court's treatment of constructive liability outside the offence of murder is deficient in part because the Court does not use a contextual approach in its analysis. 
<p>
A contextual approach avoids resolving the issues in the abstract, thereby restricting the ambit of the propositions put forward by the Court in a particular case to the specific offence under scrutiny. In the <cite>Motor Vehicle Reference</cite>, Lamer J. decontextualizes his analysis by situating the discussion at an abstract level.  He carries out his analysis of whether absolute liability is contrary to the principles of fundamental justice within the framework of the criminal common law at large, not within the narrow regulatory context of s. 94. He concludes that absolute liability when combined with the potential for imprisonment violates s. 7 of the <cite>Charter</cite>.  The proposition thus stated is broader than it needed to have been in order to deal with the provision under review in the <cite>Motor Vehicle Reference</cite>. 
<p>
The utility of a contextual approach has been approved by the Court in other situations. In <cite>R. v. Morgentaler</cite>, the majority opinion, written by Dickson C.J.C.,  stressed the importance of exploring the rights protected by s. 7 of the <cite>Charter</cite> within the context of the case before the Court. Dickson C.J.C. stated:
<blockquote>
I prefer to rest my conclusions on a narrower analysis than that put forward on behalf of the appellants. I do not think it would be appropriate to attempt an all-encompassing explication of so important a provision as s. 7 so early in the history of <cite>Charter</cite> interpretation. The Court should be presented with a wide variety of claims and factual situations before articulating the full range of s. 7 rights.<sup><a href="#thirty">30</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Wilson J. advocated use of a contextual approach in the s. 1 <cite>Charter</cite> analysis in <cite>Edmonton Journal v. Alta. (A.G.)</cite>.<sup><a href="#thirty1">31</a></sup> The issue in <cite>Edmonton Journal</cite> was whether a provincial law prohibiting media reporting of matrimonial disputes violated s. 2(b) of the <cite>Charter</cite>. Wilson J., writing for herself, agreed with the majority that the law violated freedom of
expression, but noted that she had reached her conclusion based on a different approach from the majority. Cory J., for the majority, analyzed the s. 2(b) right at an abstract level. In Wilson's opinion, the more desirable approach was one which considered the values being protected in the context of the particular case. Thus while an abstract approach would characterize the right sought to be protected as the right to &quot;the free exchange of ideas and opinions in a democratic form of society,&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty2">32</a></sup> Wilson J. described the rights at stake as &quot;the right of litigants to the protection of their privacy in matrimonial disputes and the right of the public to an open court process.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty3">33</a></sup> She noted:
<blockquote>
The contextual approach attempts to bring into sharp relief the aspect of the right or freedom which is truly at stake in the case as well as the relevant aspects of any values in competition with it. It seems to be more sensitive to the reality of the dilemma posed by the particular facts and therefore more conducive to finding a fair and just compromise between the two competing values under s. 1.<sup><a href="#thirty4">34</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The contextual approach to the s. 1 analysis advocated by Wilson J. was expressly approved by Dickson C.J.C. in <cite>R. v. Keegstra</cite><sup><a href="#thirty5">35</a></sup> and by McLachlin J. in <cite>Rocket v. Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario</cite>.<sup><a href="#thirty6">36</a></sup> In <cite>R. v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc.</cite>, Cory J. cited Wilson J.'s remarks in <cite>Edmonton Journal</cite> with approval and noted, &quot;[i]t is now clear that the <cite>Charter</cite> is to be interpreted in light of the context in which the claim arises. <i>Context is relevant both with respect to the delineation of the meaning and scope of</i> Charter <i>rights</i>, as well as to the determination of the balance to be struck [under the s. 1 analysis].&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty7">37</a></sup>
<p>
Although in <cite>Edmonton Journal</cite> Wilson J. was referring to the balancing of rights under s. 1 of the <cite>Charter</cite>, it is apparent from her approach in the <cite>Motor Vehicle Reference</cite> that she
implicitly, if not explicitly, advocates a similar approach to the s. 7 analysis. Arguably, the contextual approach would be equally useful in &quot;bring[ing] into sharp relief&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty8">38</a></sup> the basic tenets of the justice system relating to fault for a particular offence. 
<p>
I believe that the importance of carrying out the fault analysis in the context of the provision under scrutiny cannot be overemphasized. When the analysis is carried out in the abstract, there is a temptation to overstate principles in an effort to settle the issue. By predetermining issues before they actually arise in a case where a particular <cite>Criminal Code</cite> provision is under scrutiny, the Court runs the risk of foreclosing a principled, multi-faceted debate when the issue does arise at some later time. Where the issue is as convoluted and complex as fault, the risk is magnified. Indeed, an abstract approach to the fault analysis may render future consideration of fault in a particular case one-dimensional and unworkable.
<p>
A contextualized approach is crucial for determining the fault required for each offence in a meaningful and coherent manner. Only through this narrow, issue-based approach can complexities and nuances relating to fault be fully recognized and accounted for. It is counterproductive to cast the net too widely and state the principles of fundamental justice in the abstract. It is similarly counterproductive to develop a narrow principle in one situation and seek to apply it in the fault analysis for all cases. I suggest that this is what the Court has done by extending the doctrine of stigma, which was formulated in the context of murder, to other offences. While the notion of stigma is particularly apt in the context of murder, it has little value in a comparative fault analysis for other offences.
<p>
<h3>Stigma</h3>

A. EARLY APPLICATION OF THE CONCEPT OF STIGMA: THE MURDER CASES
<p>
The doctrine of stigma is first articulated in cases dealing with constructive murder. In <cite>R. v. Vaillancourt</cite>,<sup><a href="#thirty9">39</a></sup> the Supreme Court of Canada struck down s. 213(d) of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> because it was contrary to ss. 7 and 11(d) of the <cite>Charter</cite>. Seven judges, over the sole dissent of McIntyre J., held that s. 7 requires at least objective foresight of death for a conviction of murder. Section 213(d) did not meet this test, since it declared that, if death resulted from the use of a weapon during the commission of certain offences, including robbery, the accused was automatically guilty of murder. The majority held that s. 213(d) could not be saved under s. 1 of the <cite>Charter</cite>.
<p>
Section 213(d) provided:
<blockquote>
213. Culpable homicide is murder where a person causes the death of a human being while committing or attempting to commit [listed offences], whether or not the person means to cause death to any human being and whether or not he knows that death is likely to be caused to any human being, if
<p>
. . .
<p>
(d) he uses a weapon or has it upon his person
<blockquote>
(i) during or at the time he commits or attempts to commit the offence, or 
<p>
(ii) during or at the time of his flight after committing or attempting to commit the offence, 
</blockquote>
and the death ensues as a consequence.<sup><a href="#forty">40</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The only <i>mens rea</i> required for a conviction was the intent to commit (or attempt to commit) the underlying offence and the intent to use a weapon, or have it upon one's person. It was irrelevant whether the accused intended to cause bodily harm or death.
<p>
In <cite>Vaillancourt</cite>, Lamer J. first reviews the history of the constructive murder provisions and concludes that its origins are questionable.<sup><a href="#forty1">41</a></sup> He then canvasses academic criticisms and case law which support the conclusion that the law should be abolished. He also notes that the Law Reform Commission of Canada criticized s. 213 in <cite>Homicide</cite> (1984), Working Paper 33<sup><a href="#forty2">42</a></sup> and excluded constructive murder from its Draft Criminal Code.<sup><a href="#forty3">43</a></sup> Lamer J. describes constructive murder as a &quot;peculiarly common law concept which appears to be unknown outside a circle of common law jurisdictions, and it has not fared well within those jurisdictions.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty4">44</a></sup> The rule was abolished in the United Kingdom in 1957, but is still quite widely accepted in the United States. Even in the United States, however, Lamer J. notes that the rule is in decline. Where it is still in force, its scope has been severely narrowed by limiting the underlying felonies on which it is predicated. Lamer J.'s survey of other jurisdictions provides convincing authority that constructive murder as a basis for criminal liability is suspect. 
<p>
At this point, Lamer J. focuses the discussion on s. 7. He states that, &quot;[u]nder section 7, if a conviction, given either the stigma attached to the offence or the available penalties, will result in the deprivation of life, liberty or security of the person, then Parliament must respect the principles of fundamental justice.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty5">45</a></sup>
<p>
Lamer J. finds that, due to the high degree of stigma associated with a conviction for murder and its penalties, the principles of fundamental justice require a level of <i>mens rea</i> which reflects the particular nature of the crime. Writing for four justices, he stops just short of holding that subjective foresight of death is required for a murder conviction. For now, he is content to find that s. 7 principles of fundamental justice require at least objective foresight of death.<sup><a href="#forty6">46</a></sup>
<p>
Few can argue with Lamer J.'s characterization of murder as the most serious offence in our society. His observation regarding the stigma attached to a conviction for murder is similarly incontrovertible.<sup><a href="#forty7">47</a></sup> Indeed, the (U.K.) Criminal Law Revision Committee in its report on offences against the person<sup><a href="#forty8">48</a></sup> recognized that the stigma associated with the offence of murder serves a deterrent purpose and is one of the principal justifications for retaining the separate offences of murder and manslaughter.<sup><a href="#forty9">49</a></sup> However, we must ask whether the concept of stigma should even be the dominant factor which determines the constitutionally required level of fault for murder, or indeed any crime.
<p>
Lamer J.'s use of stigma becomes increasingly problematic when he extends the stigma analysis to theft. He states in <cite>Vaillancourt</cite>:
<blockquote>
. . . there are, though very few in number, certain crimes where, because of the special nature of the stigma attached to the conviction therefor or the available penalties, the principles of fundamental justice require a <i>mens rea</i> reflecting the particular nature of that crime. Such is theft, where, in my view, a conviction requires some proof of dishonesty. Murder is another such offence.<sup><a href="#fifty">50</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Lamer J. has taken the analysis out of the context of murder and into the realm of an offence which is not before the
Court. He overreaches the particular issue which is being appealed by finding that stigma is relevant to other offences, including theft. Outside the context of murder, the concept of stigma is conceptually uncertain. It is not self-evident that significant stigma attaches to a conviction for theft. This example confuses the issue. Nor does Lamer J. say specifically how stigma is to be assessed. Is it to be assessed intuitively by the courts (seemingly
the method used in <cite>Vaillancourt</cite>) or against community standards? Either way, the stigma test appears to suffer from vagueness and unpredictability of results.
<p> 
In <cite>Martineau</cite>,<sup><a href="#fifty1">51</a></sup> Lamer, now as Chief Justice, employs the same analytical techniques. Writing for five members of the Court,<sup><a href="#fifty2">52</a></sup> he holds that murder requires subjective foresight of death. Although only one of the constructive murder provisions (s. 213(a)) was at issue in <cite>Martineau</cite>, the majority strikes down the remaining three constructive murder provisions (ss 213(a)-(c)) and strikes the words &quot;ought to know&quot; from s. 212(c) [now s. 229(c)] because they are indicative of an objective standard. Lamer C.J.C. holds that subjective foresight of death is required for any conviction of murder, even though it is not necessary to resolve the case:
<blockquote>
[In <cite>Vaillancourt</cite>] I concluded that objective foreseeability of death was the minimum threshold test before a conviction for murder could be sustained. I went on to state, however, that it was my view that the principles of fundamental justice require more; they demand that a conviction for murder requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of subjective foresight of death. . . . I am still of that view today, and indeed, while I agree with the Alberta Court of Appeal and <i>could dispose of the appeal on the basis of objective foreseeability, it is on the basis
of the principle of subjective foresight of death that I choose to dispose of this appeal</i>.<sup><a href="#fifty3">53</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Lamer C.J.C.'s reasons in <cite>Martineau</cite> are brief. He states that &quot;the principles of fundamental justice require, because of the special nature of the stigma attached to a conviction for murder, and the available penalties&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty4">54</a></sup> subjective foresight of death. In the next sentence he says: &quot;The effect of s. 213 is to violate the principle that punishment must be proportionate to the moral blameworthiness of the offender. . . .&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty5">55</a></sup> This principle of
proportionality is conceptually distinct from stigma and is arguably a more reliable indicator of the fault level required. Of the two concepts---stigma or proportionality with the penalty that will be imposed---surely the latter is more reliably grounded in the principles of fundamental justice and more suitable as a basis for the fault analysis.
<p>
The punishment for murder is the most severe punishment meted out under our <cite>Criminal Code</cite>. It involves a substantial deprivation of liberty. The moral blameworthiness required for a conviction of murder must also be substantial, in proportion to the punishment. Negligence and objective foresight, in light of the severe penalties, will not suffice. Subjective foresight is required. Stigma relates to society's view of the accused;
proportionality focuses on whether the severity of the punishment matches the moral culpability of the accused. If we ask whether stigma is pivotal, or determinative, of the constitutionally required degree of fault the answer is no. 
<p>
In <cite>Martineau</cite>, there is a sense that the Court is rushing the process of constitutionalization of fault. Sopinka J., writing for himself but concurring in the result, sounds a note of caution:
<blockquote>
. . . the issue of subjective foresight of death should be addressed only if it is necessary to do so in order to decide this case or if there is an overriding reason to make it desirable to do so. Overbroad statements of principle are inimical to the tradition of incremental development of the common law. Likewise, the development of law under the <cite>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite> is best served by deciding cases before the courts, not by
anticipating the results of future cases.<sup><a href="#fifty6">56</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Sopinka J. concludes that there was no overriding reason to decide the issue of subjective foresight in <cite>Martineau</cite>. Furthermore, he recognizes the danger in making a decision regarding the validity of provisions on which neither the parties nor the interveners have made submissions. Lamer C.J.C. justifies making a
determination of issues which are not before the Court on the basis of the participation of a large number of Attorneys General in the case as interveners. Sopinka J. states, however: &quot;. . . it is not strictly accurate to state that the Attorneys General intervened on the issue [of the constitutionality of s. 212(c) or ss 213(b)-(c)]. . . . I am not convinced that the submissions of the Attorneys General, not to mention the parties, would have been the same had s. 212(c) or other sections been challenged.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty7">57</a></sup> Sopinka J. holds that only s. 213(a) is unconstitutional because it does not require proof of objective foresight. He concludes, &quot;[o]ther constitutional issues with respect to the murder provisions of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> I would leave for another day.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty8">58</a></sup>
 <p>
The Supreme Court released its decision in <cite>Logan</cite><sup><a href="#fifty9">59</a></sup> on the same day as <cite>Martineau</cite>. <cite>Logan</cite> dealt with the required level of fault for a conviction of attempted murder by parties to an offence under s. 21(2). Section 21(2) made an accessory criminally responsible on an objective standard for any offence which he or she knew, or ought to have known, the principal was likely to commit. Under s. 21(2), it was therefore possible to judge a principal on a subjective standard while judging the
accessory on an objective standard for the same offence. In dealing with the fault requirement under this section, Lamer C.J.C. states: &quot;[w]ith respect, I cannot construe <cite>Vaillancourt</cite> as saying that, as a general proposition, Parliament cannot ever enact provisions requiring different levels of guilt for principal offenders and parties.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty">60</a></sup> However, if the offence is &quot;one of the few for which s. 7 requires a minimum degree of <i>mens rea</i>, <cite>Vaillancourt</cite> does preclude Parliament from providing for the conviction of a party to that offence on the basis of a degree of <i>mens rea</i> below the constitutionally required minimum.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty1">61</a></sup> The majority therefore holds that the words &quot;ought to have known&quot; in s. 21(2) are inoperative in cases where the principal offence requires subjective foresight for conviction. 
<p>
Lamer C.J.C. finds that subjective foresight of death is required for the offence of attempted murder because the completed crime requires that degree of fault. The majority in <cite>Logan</cite> appears to settle the constitutional question of fault for attempted murder on the logic that the <i>mens rea</i> for the attempt should be the same as the <i>mens rea</i> for the completed crime.
<p>
In referring to the fault required for attempted murder, Lamer C.J.C. says that stigma, not the available penalties, is the primary factor in determining the constitutionally required level of fault. He states: &quot;[i]t should be noted that, as a basis for a constitutionally required minimum degree of <i>mens rea</i>, the social stigma associated with a conviction is the most important consideration, not the sentence.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty2">62</a></sup> This statement seems to be at odds with the dual emphasis in <cite>Martineau</cite> on stigma and proportionality between the punishment and the moral blameworthiness of the offender. Lamer C.J.C.'s reasons for moving away from reliance on proportionality may be that the punishment for attempted murder is not always as severe as the
punishment for murder. He uses the example of theft to illustrate his rationale for giving primacy to stigma. He notes that the penalties for theft range from a maximum of six months, if the Crown elects to proceed summarily, to a maximum of ten years on the indictable charge. &quot;Whether the actual or available punishment is severe or not, the social stigma associated with being labelled dishonest will be automatically and unavoidably imposed upon
conviction.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty3">63</a></sup> Lamer C.J.C. apparently decides that he must distance the &quot;penalty&quot; side of the test in <cite>Vaillancourt</cite> from the analysis in <cite>Logan</cite>. He therefore states that stigma is the primary consideration in matching the <i>mens rea</i> of the attempt to the <i>mens rea</i> of the completed crime.
<p>
This was unnecessary. As L'Heureux-Dub&eacute; J. reasons in her judgment, when mere attempts are at issue, <i>mens rea</i> assumes a dominant role.<sup><a href="#sixty4">64</a></sup> While there must be both <i>mens rea</i> and an <i>actus reus</i> to constitute an attempt, the criminality of the misconduct lies mainly
in the intention of the accused. The rationale for requiring subjective foresight for attempt crimes &quot;radiates from the primacy of the <i>mens rea</i> component, not from any potential penalties or social stigma that might attend conviction for the completed offence.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty5">65</a></sup>
<p>
In both the <cite>Martineau</cite> and <cite>Logan</cite> majority reasons, there is no attempt to canvass the common law, writings of academic and other lawyers, or findings and recommendations of law reform bodies in order to build a framework of the principles of fundamental justice as they specifically relate to the provision under
scrutiny.<sup><a href="#sixty6">66</a></sup> Lamer C.J.C. starts the analysis in both decisions from where he
left off in <cite>Vaillancourt</cite>, using the concept of stigma to resolve the required level of fault for the offence. As noted, while the concept of stigma has some value as a factor for determining the required degree of fault in the context of murder as the offence which attracts the harshest punishments, outside this context its value as a tool is limited because of its conceptual uncertainty. Furthermore, in the context of other offences, as the  examination of <cite>Logan</cite> above begins to illustrate, reliance on the doctrine of stigma circumvents a principled and fully contextual analysis.
<p>
B. THE ELASTICITY OF STIGMA AND ITS LIMITATIONS AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL
<p>
The Court first extends the doctrine of stigma beyond the offence of murder in <cite>DeSousa</cite><sup><a href="#sixty7">67</a></sup> where it considers the constitutionally required degree of fault for the offence of unlawfully causing bodily harm (s. 269 of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>). In <cite>DeSousa</cite>, the weakness of the Supreme Court's analysis in the murder cases becomes immediately apparent. A unanimous bench of five justices<sup><a href="#sixty8">68</a></sup> declares that, absent very special stigma, objective fault is
constitutionally sufficient for any type of offence. 
<p>
In <cite>DeSousa</cite>, the Court holds that the offence of unlawfully causing bodily harm does not violate s. 7. The Court interprets s. 269 to require two separate mental elements. First, the mental element of the underlying offence must be satisfied: the bodily harm must be caused as a result of an &quot;unlawful act.&quot;  The Court holds that to be unlawful, either federal or provincial offences can qualify, but not offences based on absolute liability or those which have a constitutionally insufficient mental element of their own. Second, Sopinka J. interprets the offence to require that the unlawful act be at least objectively dangerous. The test, borrowed from British case law on unlawful act manslaughter, is whether a reasonable person would realize that the underlying unlawful act would subject another person to the risk of bodily harm.
<p>
The s. 7 analysis is brief. Sopinka J. states: 
<blockquote>
As this Court has not indicated that fundamental justice requires fault based on a subjective standard for all offences, the mental element required by s. 269 passes constitutional muster unless s. 269 is one of those few offences which due to its stigma and penalty require fault based on a subjective standard. I agree with the respondent [Crown] and interveners that s. 269 has neither the stigma nor criminal sanction to require a more demanding mental element than it already has.<sup><a href="#sixty9">69</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Sopinka J. does not set out a framework for the principles of fundamental justice at issue in the context of unlawfully causing bodily harm. The Court gives no substantive consideration to whether the offence of unlawfully causing bodily harm should be interpreted as one which does require subjective foresight of the risk of harm. In addition, Sopinka J. further abstracts the analysis from the context of the offence under consideration by basing his analysis on the law relating to unlawful act manslaughter. His conclusions arise from the concept of stigma and he thereby circumvents a contextual analysis of fault.
<p>
We can now see the danger inherent in developing a test which has narrow applicability to the context of murder and applying it in all cases. Its elastic nature makes stigma difficult to assess in any principled manner. How is the severe stigma associated with theft to be compared with the stigma associated with unlawfully causing bodily harm?  Theft in a particular set of circumstances may have a great deal of stigma attached to it. Theft in another context may have very little. Similarly, unlawfully causing bodily harm in some circumstances may attract very low stigma; in others, a significantly higher level may be involved, depending on how the offence was carried out.
<p>
<cite>DeSousa</cite>, Sopinka J. tacitly approves constructive liability in <cite>Criminal Code</cite> offences, without acknowledging that this contradicts the Court's rejection of constructive liability in <cite>Vaillancourt</cite> and <cite>Martineau</cite>.<sup><a href="#seventy">70</a></sup> He states in <i>obiter</i> that there is no common law or constitutional principle that requires fault to be related to each of the elements of the <i>actus reus</i> of the offence. He goes further and notes that there are a number of <cite>Criminal Code</cite> offences which &quot;call for a more serious charge if certain consequences follow. To require intention in relation to each and every consequence would bring a large number of offences into question. . . .&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy1">71</a></sup> Sopinka J. lists 13 other <cite>Criminal Code</cite> offences, including manslaughter, where this would be the case. His comments are <i>obiter</i> and they are clearly unnecessary to determine the fault required for the offence under consideration. Nor are his comments reflective of the position taken by modern law reform commissions or academic writers that fault must relate to the penalized consequence or circumstances which form part of the <i>actus reus</i>.<sup><a href="#seventy2">72</a></sup> As Stuart puts it, &quot;[a] test of foresight, whether subjective or objective, has little meaning if it exists in the air and does not fully relate to the consequences.&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy3">73</a></sup> Arguably, in taking his analysis outside the context of the offence in question, Sopinka J. has significantly foreclosed the fault discussion in future cases where any of the listed offences he addresses in <i>obiter</i> may be under scrutiny. 
<p>
In fact, in <cite>Creighton</cite><sup><a href="#seventy4">74</a></sup> a majority of the Court does rely on <cite>DeSousa</cite> to hold that objective foresight of harm meets the constitutional fault requirements for unlawful act manslaughter under s. 222(5) of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>.<sup><a href="#seventy5">75</a></sup> McLachlin J. (L'Heureux-Dub&eacute;, Gonthier and Cory JJ. concurring)
notes that <cite>DeSousa</cite> has determined that the fact that an offence depends upon a predicate offence does not render it unconstitutional, provided that the predicate offence involves a dangerous act, is not an offence of absolute liability, and is not unconstitutional. 
<p>
McLachlin J. finds that the test for unlawful act manslaughter is objective foreseeability of a risk of bodily harm which is neither trivial nor transitory. She relies on Sopinka J.'s <i>obiter</i> comments in <cite>DeSousa</cite> for the proposition that subjective foreseeability of the risk of the <i>actus reus</i> is not required. She also holds, although it was not necessary to address the issue in this case, that the <i>mens rea</i> for manslaughter by criminal negligence should also be assessed according to an objective standard. Her discussion relating to criminal negligence is in the nature of an aside:
<blockquote>
The cases establish that in addition to the <i>actus reus</i> and <i>mens rea</i> associated with the underlying act, all that is required to support a manslaughter conviction is reasonable foreseeability of the risk of bodily harm. While s. 222(5)(a) does not expressly require foreseeable bodily harm, it has been so interpreted: see <cite>R. v. DeSousa</cite>, <i>supra</i>. The unlawful act must be objectively dangerous, that is likely to injure
another person. The law of unlawful act manslaughter has not, however, gone so far as to require foreseeability of death. The same is true for manslaughter predicated on criminal negligence; while criminal negligence, <i>infra</i>, requires a marked departure from the standards of a reasonable person in all the circumstances, it
does not require foreseeability of death.<sup><a href="#seventy6">76</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Having found the mental element at common law for unlawful act manslaughter and criminal negligence to be objective foreseeability of harm which is neither trivial nor transitory, McLachlin J. proceeds to determine whether this mental element accords with the principles of fundamental justice.
<p>
She reasons that the objective test based on foreseeability of harm does not violate the principles of fundamental justice because it is entirely appropriate to the stigma associated with the offence of manslaughter. She disagrees with Lamer C.J.C., who characterizes the stigma associated with manslaughter as high enough to justify objective foreseeability of death.
<blockquote>
To the extent that stigma is relied on as requiring foreseeability of the risk of death in the offence of manslaughter, I
find it unconvincing. The most important feature of the stigma of manslaughter is the stigma which is <i>not</i> attached to it. The <cite>Criminal Code</cite> confines manslaughter to non-intentional homicide. A person convicted of manslaughter is <i>not</i> a murderer.<sup><a href="#seventy7">77</a></sup>
</blockquote>
McLachlin J.'s reasoning has a perplexing circularity: &quot;. . . the stigma attached to manslaughter is an appropriate stigma.&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy8">78</a></sup>
<p>
McLachlin J. then finds that the relationship between the required <i>mens rea</i> and the penalty for manslaughter is appropriate because of the flexibility available with respect to sentencing. &quot;Murder entails a mandatory life sentence; manslaughter carries with it no minimum sentence. This is appropriate. Because manslaughter can occur in a wide variety of circumstances, the penalties must be flexible.&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy9">79</a></sup>
<p>
The notion of stigma, on which her reasoning hinges, has allowed McLachlin J. to overcome the subjective hurdle. However, this points to the problem with using stigma: its elasticity makes it capable of being manipulated at will. In <cite>Creighton</cite>, for example, one senses that McLachlin J. has tailored her assessment of the stigma associated with a conviction of manslaughter to suit the desired outcome. The fact that the actual circumstances of the killing in <cite>Creighton</cite> themselves could give rise to a high degree of stigma is not factored into her analysis.<sup><a href="#eighty">80</a></sup>
<p>
In <cite>Creighton</cite>, Lamer C.J.C. (Sopinka, Iacobucci, and Major JJ. concurring) also agrees that an objective standard is appropriate for unlawful act manslaughter. 
<blockquote>
The only basis upon which subjective foresight of death or the risk of death could be found to be constitutionally required in the case of unlawful act manslaughter, therefore, would be to find that the offence is one of those crimes for which `because of the special nature of the stigma attached to a conviction therefor or the available penalties the principles of fundamental justice require a <i>mens rea</i> reflecting the particular nature of that
crime.'<sup><a href="#eighty1">81</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Lamer C.J.C. concludes that the stigma which attaches to unlawful act manslaughter, while significant, does not approach the opprobrium reserved for those special offences. He finds, however, that the stigma attaching to manslaughter is sufficiently high to require, at a minimum, objective foresight of the risk of death. As we have seen, McLachlin J. used the stigma analysis to reach the conclusion that objective foresight need only relate to the risk of
harm, not death. These divergent findings highlight the weakness of the doctrine of stigma as a basis for determining the constitutionally required degree of fault. 
<p>
In the companion cases to <cite>Creighton</cite> (<cite>Naglik, Gosset</cite>, and <cite>Finlay</cite>), application of the stigma analysis is formulaic: first, assess the fault required by the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> provision at issue (based on precedent, statutory interpretation, and legislative intent), second, determine that the
stigma associated with the offence is not particularly high, and finally, conclude that an objective standard will meet the constitutionally required level of fault as defined by the chosen degree of stigma. In none of these cases does the Court carry out a contextual analysis of the fault associated with the provision under review. The analysis turns on the manipulatable criterion of stigma.
<p>
C. <cite>HUNDAL</cite>:  APPLYING A CONTEXTUALIZED ANALYSIS
<p>
<cite>DeSousa</cite> and <cite>Creighton</cite> stand in direct opposition to <cite>Hundal</cite>,<sup><a href="#eighty2">82</a></sup> in which the Court carries out a contextual fault analysis without reference to stigma. At issue in <cite>Hundal</cite> was the constitutionality of the dangerous driving provision of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>, s. 233 (now s. 249). Section 233 does not specify the degree of fault required for conviction. Cory J. finds that &quot;the law with regard to driving offences is a mess.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty3">83</a></sup> A survey of earlier cases dealing with the section reveals that the requisite <i>mens rea</i> has ranged from something &quot;more than inadvertent negligence&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty4">84</a></sup> to a &quot;standard of care that a prudent driver would have exercised. . .  .&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty5">85</a></sup> Cory J. (L'Heureux-Dub&eacute;, Sopinka, Gonthier, and Iacobucci JJ. concurring) favours an objective standard but notes that the constitutionality of an objective standard will depend on the elements of the particular provision and its context. The Court's analysis is grounded in the
context of the specific offence under review and in the facts of this particular case.
<p>
Cory J. does not find the constitutionality of s. 233 to be self-evident. He undertakes a principled analysis to justify his conclusion that a modified objective standard for dangerous driving is, in fact, constitutional. He states that the test for negligence is objective, requiring a &quot;marked departure from the standard of care of a reasonable person,&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty6">86</a></sup> and advocates a &quot;clear distinction in the law between one who has been aware (pure subjective intent) and one who should have taken care irrespective of awareness (pure objective intent).&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty7">87</a></sup>
<p>
He notes that driving is a licensed activity which is often automatic and reflexive: &quot;[i]t would be a denial of common sense for a driver, whose conduct was objectively dangerous, to be acquitted on the ground that he was not thinking of his manner of driving at the time of the accident.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty8">88</a></sup> He describes negligent driving as &quot;a continuum that progresses, or regresses, from momentary lack of attention giving rise to civil responsibility through careless driving under a provincial Highway Traffic Act to dangerous driving under the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty9">89</a></sup> Cory J. considers the wording of the section and the public policy underlying the offence, and concludes that a modified objective test which takes into account the circumstances surrounding the offence is appropriate.<sup><a href="#ninety">90</a></sup>
<p>
In <cite>Hundal</cite>, the Court asserts that mere unreasonable behaviour will not suffice for a conviction. A conviction will require a gross departure from the standard of care of a reasonable person. In separate reasons, McLachlin J. (Lamer C.J.C. concurring) sets out justifications for taking the objective approach in criminal
negligence which have been put forward by various academic writers:
<blockquote>
It follows that a dangerous or repugnant act, coupled with want of care representing a marked departure from the standard of a reasonable person in all the circumstances, may constitute a criminal offence. To accept the appellant's submission that in all criminal cases the Crown must establish subjective <i>mens rea</i> would be to put the range of culpable conduct described by Stuart, Rosenberg and Stalker---conduct which has long formed part of our criminal law---beyond the law's reach. That, to me, does not make sense.<sup><a href="#ninety1">91</a></sup>
</blockquote>
McLachlin J. expressly agrees with Cory J. that &quot;there should be a clear distinction in the law between one who was aware (pure subjective intent) and one who should have taken care irrespective of awareness (pure objective intent).&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety2">92</a></sup>
<p>
I believe that the analysis in <cite>Hundal</cite> leads to a supportable outcome. The judgments go only as far as necessary to resolve the issues before the Court. The decision accords with the view of most judges, writers, and law commissions that there is a philosophical and just basis for punishing someone who was not aware of the risk but who ought to have been.<sup><a href="#ninety3">93</a></sup> In the context of criminal negligence, the attractiveness of the objective test is that it takes into account two important factors: whether the wrongdoer was &quot;on notice&quot; that his conduct was potentially harmful (and yet he did not take heed), and whether the mistake that the wrongdoer made was unreasonable. If both are present, then we may describe his conduct as that which a reasonable person would not have pursued in the circumstances. In such cases, we are willing to say that inadvertence to risk, as well as choosing to take a particular risk, may warrant the just censure of others. In other words, when the circumstances give the actor reason to think that his conduct risks harm to another, his failure to take notice of the risks associated with his conduct is culpable. In such cases, it can be argued that negligence may support sanctions as convincingly as does intentional conduct. Hence, in applying the objective standard of fault to the accused's conduct in the circumstances of <cite>Hundal</cite>, Cory J. found that the &quot;appellant's manner of driving represented a gross departure from the standard of a reasonably prudent driver&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety4">94</a></sup> in the circumstances of the accident.
<p>
D. THE ANOMALY OF CONSTRUCTIVE LIABILITY AND ITS PERSISTENCE IN SUPREME COURT JURISPRUDENCE
<p>
One of the disturbing aspects in the Supreme Court's treatment of the constitutional aspects of fault is the persistence
of constructive liability without appropriate consideration of its implications within the general framework of criminal liability. Although the Court rejected the constructive murder rule in <cite>Vaillancourt</cite> and <cite>Martineau</cite>, it has given tacit approval to constructive liability in <cite>DeSousa</cite> and upheld the constructive crime of unlawful act manslaughter in <cite>Creighton</cite>, without substantiating its position through analysis.<sup><a href="#ninety5">95</a></sup> In neither of these cases does the Court directly address the fact that constructive liability is at issue. The Court avoids the issue by divorcing its analysis from the context of the offence and the circumstances of each case and focusing instead on stigma. 
<p>
The most powerful manifestation of constructive liability is the felony-murder rule which provides that if a person is killed during the commission of a felony, the felon is criminally liable not only for the felony but also for the death, which is treated as murder. According to the traditional doctrine, the death constitutes murder even though the felon did not intend to kill. The felony-murder rule was held to be unconstitutional in <cite>Vaillancourt</cite> and <cite>Martineau</cite>.
<p>
Another constructive liability offence at common law, the misdemeanour-manslaughter rule, is codified in s. 222(5) of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> as unlawful act manslaughter. Unlawful act manslaughter takes the criminal intent or recklessness with respect to a (relatively minor)<sup><a href="#ninety6">96</a></sup> underlying offence, couples it with the harm caused (death), and constructs liability for the serious offence (manslaughter). Similarly, unlawfully causing bodily harm imports the logic of constructive liability in that an accused person can be found guilty without intending to bring about the consequence of bodily harm. 
<p>
Critics of constructive liability contend that it produces an unjust disproportionality between punishment and intent.<sup><a href="#ninety7">97</a></sup> They argue that constructive liability is clearly unjust even where the unlawful act requires some element of subjective intent to be proved, because the accused is still being punished for an act which he neither desired nor intended. 
<p>
Other objections to constructive liability are often based on the argument that there must be a match between the <i>mens rea</i> and the <i>actus reus</i> which is prohibited. Where part of the <i>actus reus</i> consists of causing death (as in unlawful act manslaughter), then <i>mens rea</i> should relate to that consequence as well as to the unlawful act. Similarly, if part of the <i>actus reus</i> consists of causing injury (as in unlawfully causing
bodily harm), then the intention or recklessness must go to causing the injury as well as to the predicate offence. However, constructive liability requires no such connection between the <i>mens rea</i> and the <i>actus reus</i>.
<p>
Constructive liability has been justified on the basis of retribution and deterrence.<sup><a href="#ninety8">98</a></sup> It is argued that the felony-murder rule in particular is a retributive rule which is premised on society's belief that a killing committed in the course of a serious crime deserves the stigma of murder. Holding the accused liable for murder, it is argued, reaffirms society's belief in the sanctity of life, expresses solidarity with the victim, and serves to give the accused his just desserts.<sup><a href="#ninety9">99</a></sup>
Constructive liability, in general, is supposedly based on the relationship between dessert and consequences (instead of the relationship between dessert and intent). If a particular level of intent is present for certain consequences, this form of proportionality demands that the causation of more serious consequences is deserving of the more serious punishment.<sup><a href="#onehundred">100</a></sup>
<p>
Arguments put forward to justify felony murder, if persuasive at all, are less persuasive in the context of manslaughter.<sup><a href="#one01">101</a></sup> Since the underlying wrongful conduct in unlawful act
manslaughter may be less inherently dangerous than the conduct underlying a felony murder, it is arguably less worthy of condemnation and of punishment proportional to the actual consequences.<sup><a href="#one02">102</a></sup>
<p>
The offence of unlawfully causing bodily harm has an aspect of constructive liability if there is no requirement that there be reasonable foresight of the consequence of bodily harm. If an accused is engaged in some sort of unlawful behavior, and bodily harm which is unforeseeable results, under s. 269 the accused can be held liable for unlawfully causing bodily harm, which is possibly a more serious offence than the offence on which the bodily harm is predicated. In <cite>DeSousa</cite>, Sopinka J. explicitly states that there is no common law or constitutional principle that the fault requirement must relate to the consequences, as well as the unlawful act, which together form the elements of the <i>actus reus</i>. In so stating, he endorses constructive liability and the anomalies which accompany it. Sopinka J., however, does not address the issue. He does not canvass the common law, academic writers, and law reform commissions to build a framework in which to carry out his s. 7 analysis, and he thus avoids addressing the problems of constructive liability which arise within this framework. Although Sopinka J. holds that in this particular offence there must be objective foresight of bodily harm, he has at a theoretical level approved the
use of constructive liability in other <cite>Criminal Code</cite> offences, including manslaughter, without confronting and analyzing the issue.
<p>
In <cite>Creighton</cite>, the Court never acknowledges the link between unlawful act manslaughter and the common law offence of misdemeanour-manslaughter. Indeed, the issue of constructive liability is not addressed in any of the judgments in <cite>Creighton</cite>, although the main point in contention between McLachlin J. and Lamer C.J.C. is whether <i>mens rea</i> should relate to death or mere harm. The majority favours the latter view, thereby implicitly confirming the offence as one of constructive liability. McLachlin J. refers to Sopinka J.'s statement in <cite>DeSousa</cite> to justify her reasoning that the mental element of unlawful act manslaughter is reasonable foreseeability of the risk of bodily harm, in keeping with constructive liability principles:
<blockquote>
It is now settled that the fact that an offence depends upon a predicate offence does not render it unconstitutional, provided that the predicate offence involves a dangerous act, is not an offence of absolute liability, and is not unconstitutional: <cite>R. v. DeSousa</cite>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 944. But a further objection is raised in this case. It is said that the offence of manslaughter is unconstitutional because it requires only foreseeability of the risk of bodily harm and not foreseeability of death, and that the trial judge erred in requiring only foreseeability of bodily  harm.
<p>
The cases establish that in addition to the <i>actus reus</i> and the <i>mens rea</i> associated with the underlying act, all that is required to support a manslaughter conviction is reasonable foreseeability of the risk of bodily harm.<sup><a href="#one03">103</a></sup>
</blockquote>
On McLachlin J.'s reasoning, an accused may be found guilty of the more serious offence of manslaughter where he committed a less serious offence as long as there was reasonable foresight of bodily harm. It is not necessary that the bodily harm be serious; it need only be &quot;neither trivial nor transitory.&quot;<sup><a href="#one04">104</a></sup> McLachlin J. has clearly defined the offence as one of constructive liability. 
<p>
Neither McLachlin J. nor Lamer C.J.C. situates the arguments in <cite>Creighton</cite> within the framework of constructive liability. Neither of them discusses the common law offence of misdemeanour-manslaughter. This is surprising, since the offence of unlawful act manslaughter so clearly resonates with constructive liability overtones. Neither of them addresses the perplexing anomaly of the Court's emphatic rejection of constructive liability in the context of murder and its acceptance of constructive liability in other contexts. Under a contextualized analysis, it would have been harder to ignore the widespread recognition of the doctrinal anomalies associated with constructive liability. It may be that constructive liability in these offences <i>is</i> compatible with the principles of fundamental justice. However, since the Court failed to address the issue, there is now a significant gap in its
reasoning.
<p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

Within the framework of the fault analysis under s. 7 of the <cite>Charter</cite>, a contextual approach recognizes that different factors will assume prominence in determining which principles of fundamental justice are relevant to the offence under scrutiny. The Court should look to the common law, academic writers, and law reform commissions to assist in identifying such factors. A contextual analysis avoids resolving the issues in the abstract and thereby restricts the ambit of the propositions put forward by the Court in a particular case to the offence under scrutiny.
<p>
In <cite>Vaillancourt</cite>, Lamer C.J.C. utilized the doctrine of stigma as an analytical tool which was helpful in the context of the offence of murder. However, in extending the notion of stigma beyond the context of murder, the Court established a questionable framework of analysis for determining the constitutionally required degree of fault. 
<p>
Furthermore, outside the context of murder, the notion of stigma becomes conceptually uncertain. Stigma, with its inherent elasticity and malleability, cannot form the basis of a principled review. By characterizing the stigma of the offence as sufficiently low, a court can find negligence or objective <i>mens rea</i> to be sufficient to meet the constitutional standard set out in s. 7. The Court's reliance on the elastic notion of stigma has allowed it to short-circuit the analysis of the principles of fundamental justice surrounding each issue. In <cite>DeSousa</cite>, for example, Sopinka J. gives cursory attention to the analysis of the principles of fundamental justice which might require a court to find that a subjective standard of <i>mens rea</i> is constitutionally necessary. In so doing, he artificially divorces fault from its context. In <cite>Creighton</cite>, McLachlin J. proceeds on the assumption that the stigma associated with manslaughter is sufficiently low that she need not even consider whether subjective fault is required.
<p>
The Court's approval of constructive liability in <cite>DeSousa</cite> and <cite>Creighton</cite> is disturbing in light of its sound rejection of the constructive murder rule in <cite>Vaillancourt</cite>. The majority in <cite>Creighton</cite> did not address the element of constructive liability in unlawful act manslaughter and therefore did not adequately justify its position. This inconsistent treatment of constructive liability has resulted in a significant degree of incoherence in Canadian criminal law.
<p>
La Forest J.'s reasons in <cite>Creighton</cite> strike a rather ironic note. He states:
<blockquote>
I start with the fact that, both at the constitutional level and in the interpretation of offences, I favour where practicable the adoption of subjective rather than objective <i>mens rea</i>.; see, for example my concurrence with Wilson J. in <cite>R. v. Tutton</cite>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1392, a case dealing with manslaughter by criminal negligence. . . .
<p>
I was concerned about the application of the doctrine [of objective <i>mens rea</i>] to offences of a truly criminal character that apply to a wide variety of circumstances. However, any possibility of limiting objective <i>mens rea</i> to regulatory offences or offences having a regulatory base has now been overtaken by the unanimous decision of the panel (comprising a majority of the Court) in <cite>R. v. DeSousa</cite>.<sup><a href="#one05">105</a></sup>
</blockquote>
La Forest J.'s comments pinpoint a basic problem that has been created by the Supreme Court's review of the constitutional requirement for fault. By deciding once and for all what level of fault is required as a constitutional minimum, the Court has effectively ended the debate in Canada surrounding one of the fundamental perplexities of the criminal law. This might be acceptable were it not for the doubtful analytical techniques which the Court has used to reach its conclusions. By resorting to analytical techniques such as the doctrine of stigma which have allowed it to jump over the most significant hurdle in the fault analysis, namely, whether there is a requirement for subjective intent, the Court has avoided some of the most difficult questions surrounding the issue of criminal fault. The result of the Court's deliberations may be to strip from the law many of the nuances relating to fault that have shaped the very principles of fundamental justice that the Court is seeking to protect.
<p>
Parliament may enact, and the courts may interpret, any given provision to import a higher level of <i>mens rea</i> than is constitutionally required. However, in light of the outcome of the Supreme Court's deliberations, why should they do so?  Parliament can argue that it need only meet its constitutional obligations. The courts may reason that there is no need to go further.
<p>
The irony of the stigma analysis is that it was fashioned to bring the law into line with forward-looking criminal law principles. It later became the vehicle for circumventing a principled, contextualized consideration of fault. In the end, we are left with a statement about the constitutionally required level of fault which is too general, and which is predicated on an unworkable analysis. &quot;What the court is saying here is if Parliament wants to define a crime with an objective basis of liability---as long as it's not a `stigma' offence---then it will be constitutionally permissible for them to do so.&quot;<sup><a href="#one06">106</a></sup>

<li><a name="forty6">La Forest J.</a> wrote a separate opinion agreeing with Lamer J. that &quot;because of the stigma attached to a conviction for murder, the principles of fundamental justice require a <i>mens rea</i> reflecting the particular nature of that crime, namely one referable to causing death.&quot;  <cite>Vaillancourt</cite>, <i>ibid.</i> at 665. He too did not find it necessary to determine whether there was a requirement for subjective foresight, since the mental element of s. 213(d) was so remote from even objective
foresight of death that the provision violated the principles of fundamental justice. Beetz J., LeDain J. concurring, also wrote a separate opinion agreeing with Lamer J. and La Forest J. that s. 213(d) did not accord with the principles of fundamental justice.

Marie</cite>, <i>supra</i> note 24, where Dickson J. observes that there is a stigma attached to a conviction for public welfare offences. Dickson J. holds, however, that public welfare offences do not require full <i>mens rea</i>.

It is important that the definition of murder should, so far as possible, ensure that those convicted of murder will be deserving of the stigma. Too wide a law of murder would not only be unjust but would also tend to diminish the stigma to which we (and most of those who commented on our Working Paper) attach value.&quot; The CLRC recommended that the mental element for murder should be an intent to kill, or causing &quot;death by unlawful act intended to cause
serious injury&quot; which the accused knows involves a risk of causing death. <i>Ibid.</i> at 14.

There is, however, little incentive for the Crown to proceed under unlawful act manslaughter for these serious offences since the penalties associated with the underlying act are frequently just as severe as the penalty imposed for manslaughter.
<p>
<li><a name="ninety7">See for example, D. Stuart,</a> <cite>Canadian Criminal Law: A Treatise</cite>, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 1987) at 207--39. &quot;To one not versed in the intricacies of our homicide law, it will come as a shock that our most serious offences, murder and manslaughter, are exceptions to the pure <i>mens rea</i> principle which requires that the accused be actually aware of the relevant consequences and/or circumstances,&quot; <i>ibid.</i> at 207. Constructive liability has been described as &quot;a noxious doctrine in the criminal law&quot;: P. Healy, &quot;<cite>Creighton</cite> Quartet: Enigma Variations in a Lower Key&quot; (1993) 23 C.R.

<p>
<li><a name="onehundred">We see this reasoning in attempts:</a> whereas the same level of intent (and
hence the same level of blameworthiness) is present for the attempted crime and the completed crime, the criminal law punishes the completed crime more severely because the consequences of the attempt have materialized. In <cite>Recodifying Criminal Law</cite>, <i>supra</i> note 43 at 45, the Law Reform Commission of Canada recommended that the penalty for attempts should be set at half the penalty for the completed crime. The Commission's justification was that &quot;an attempter creates less actual harm than a successful committer.&quot;

There has been a trend in Canada, particularly since the late 1960s, toward recognizing the marital unit rather than the individual as the appropriate unit for purposes of income taxation. In this article, the author examines the profound social policy choices underlying the choice of a tax unit. She illuminates the Canadian system by  comparing it and its development with the American system. She analyses the individual and family units of taxation using broad goals of a tax system and concludes that an individual system of taxation better meets the objectives of equity, neutrality and simplicity. From this ideal she goes on to show how the current Canadian tax system can be reformed by adopting the principled solution of an individual-based tax unit together with a family-based system of income maintenance.

<h3>I. Introduction</h3>

One of the fundamental choices that must be made in any system of taxation is to determine what the unit to be taxed will be. The choice of unit not only affects how the tax system is structured, it also has profound effects on society at large: it can promote certain types of family structures by providing them with economic incentives; it can affect a married woman's decision to work outside the home. This article demonstrates that the individual is the most justifiable unit of taxation. While this statement might seem uncontroversial---the individual has been used as the unit of taxation in Canada since 1917---there are many who advocate a change to a family unit of taxation because they view it as more in accord with reality. In fact, since the recommendation in 1966 by the Carter Commission<sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup> that the family be substituted as the basis of taxation in Canada, there has been recurring debate about such a change. Moreover, since 1966, while theoretically maintaining an individual unit of taxation, the Canadian tax system has gradually moved to recognize the family as the unit of taxation. At this time the debate has been intensified by the pressure that exists on Canada to harmonize its tax system with its biggest trading partner, the United States, which presently has a family taxation system. As well, there is a possibility that the outcome of several cases on income-splitting presently percolating through the Canadian court system could create renewed enthusiasm for the family unit. Calls for change are subtle, but may
spark serious debate at any time. This article attempts to inform such a debate.
<p>
In part II, this article will deal with the history of both the Canadian and the American systems of taxation, focusing on the change in the United States from an individual taxation system to a family taxation system and highlighting the problems which followed from that change. This article will then deal with the differences among the family unit proponents and emphasize how those differences point to a fundamental flaw within their arguments. In part III, this article will introduce the three objectives of a taxation system---equity, neutrality, and simplicity---and show how these objectives will always conflict and create policy difficulties, as well as how they can be used to evaluate the two units of taxation. This article will then analyse both units of taxation in depth using each of these three objectives in turn. Finally, in part IV, this article will outline factors other than the ideas written about in part III
which might influence a change to a family taxation system. The article then gives suggestions for changes to the present Canadian system which will make it more equitable and allow a principled solution to the perennial debate. It concludes that the best unit of taxation is individual-based, together with a family-based system of income maintenance.
<p>

<h3>II. The Present Canadian and American Taxation Systems and Their Evolution</h3>

As Canada and the United States both originally adopted the individual as the basic tax unit, it is instructive to see why the American system has developed so differently. Specifically, it is useful in any debate about the comparative merits of individual and family units of taxation to understand why the United States moved to the family as the basic tax unit and to explain its experience since making the change.
<p>
1. CANADIAN TAXATION SYSTEM
<p>
<i>a. History of the System</i><br>
As already mentioned, the initial choice of taxation unit in Canada and in the United States was the individual. This
determination was made in Canada in 1917 when the federal government introduced the <cite>Income War Tax Act</cite>. In the United States, a federal income tax statute was introduced four years earlier, in 1913. Several commentators have said that the initial choice in Canada was made more by default than as a result of any analysis of the issues at stake,<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup> but a contrast between the original choice of tax unit in the New World (Canada, United States, and Australia) and Europe does not bear out this statement. The initial choice of taxation unit in most European countries (Britain, France, and Sweden) was the family, based on the assumption that the tax unit should correspond to property rights under the civil law or marital property law.<sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup> Most European countries introduced income tax systems much
earlier than the New World; Britain in 1799 and Sweden at the end of the sixteenth century.<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup> These systems started at a time when marital property rules treated the couple or family as a unit under the control of the male head of the household. In countries where married women had gained control of their property when income tax provisions were introduced (Canada, United States, and Australia) it was taken for granted that the taxpayer would be the individual. While there may not have been a discussion in Canada of the policy implications inherent in the choice of tax unit---and there was certainly no discussion of the ability to pay---the underlying reason for the choice, in my opinion, seems clear: consistency with the marital property regime.
<p>
Compared to the United States, the history of Canada's tax treatment of the family is remarkably sedate and uneventful. Canada adopted the individual as the unit of taxation in 1917 and has never swerved from its original path; the United States has taken a very different course. Under the current Canadian tax system, the unit of
taxation is the individual and the person who has the property or legal interest in income is taxed on it. The most important aspect of this system of taxation is that the taxpayer's marital status does not, on the whole,<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup> affect his or her tax status. In 1966, the Carter Commission<sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup>
recommended that Canada should adopt the family as the unit of taxation; children were to be included in the tax unit.<sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup> These recommendations were never acted upon.
<p>
The last official examination of Canada's tax unit was done in 1975--76 by a federal Interdepartmental Committee on the Taxation of Women.<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup> On the issue of the tax unit, the committee was split down the middle; half of its members, led by the Revenue Department, supported joint spousal taxation, the
other members, separate taxation.
<p>
<i>b. Current Canadian System</i><br>
While the individual is the basic unit of taxation in Canada, marital and family status are relevant in some provisions of the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite>.<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup> In the years since the Carter Commission, there has been a gradual change in the income tax system to recognize the family as the unit of taxation. The latest amendment in the long line of changes is the legislation introduced by the Department of Finance in the February 1992 budget to treat common-law couples in the same way as married couples for all purposes of the <cite>Act</cite>.
<p>
The provisions that make marital and family status relevant in the <cite>Act</cite> can be categorized into three groups: those that are favourable or unfavourable to the marital unit and those that are designed to maintain neutrality toward the marriage unit.
<p>
First let me deal with the provisions that are designed to preserve the principle of using the individual as the tax unit, those that maintain neutrality in the treatment of spouses. The <cite>Income Tax Act</cite> provides rules to ensure that marriage does not affect the separate tax liability of individual spouses. The most important of these provisions are the &quot;attribution rules,&quot;<sup><a href="#ten">10</a></sup> which are intended to prevent spouses from transferring property from one to the other in order to split income and reduce the total amount of tax payable. The reason for the rules is obvious; under an individual system of taxation the higher income spouse (usually the husband) can make tax savings by hiving off income which would ordinarily be assessed to him onto his spouse, who has a lower marginal tax rate because of earning little or no income. The attribution rules nullify the desired effect of transfers of income or income-producing assets to spouses by &quot;attributing&quot; or &quot;deeming&quot; the income from the transferred income or asset to continue to belong to the transferor.
<p>
The attribution rules were tightened considerably in 1985 and in particular, loans were no longer permitted as an exclusion from the attribution rules. However, the attribution rules apply only to income from property and capital gains and losses realized on the subsequent disposition of property. It is a matter of debate among practitioners as to how effective these rules are in practice.
<p>
The other provisions that are designed to maintain the integrity of the tax base and the progressivity of the rates are aimed at preventing the reallocation of certain kinds of income (other than income from property) to persons other than the legal owners of that income<sup><a href="#eleven">11</a></sup> and frustrating &quot;non-arm's length&quot; transfers for inadequate consideration.<sup><a href="#twelve">12</a></sup> The latter are designed to limit the potential effects of attempts to split income between non-arm's length persons; spouses deal with each other at non-arm's length.<sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup>
<p>
The second category of provisions that make marital and family status relevant in the <cite>Act</cite> are those which are designed to reduce tax liabilities of couple families---those which are favourable to the marital unit. These provisions allow tax credits to the high-earner spouse and permit the transfer of unused tax credits to the high-earner spouse. Specifically these provisions are: the married credit;<sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup> the ability to
transfer unused age, pension, tuition, education, and disability credits;<sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup> the
ability to transfer dividend income from Canadian corporations;<sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup> spousal rollovers of capital property during lifetime or on death;<sup><a href="#seventeen">17</a></sup> and the provisions with respect to spousal RRSPs and the treatment of RRSPs on death.
<p>
In addition there are provisions with respect to RRSPs that are favourable to the marital unit. The <cite>Act</cite> allows one spouse a deduction for contributing to the other's RRSP.<sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup> There are also rules which allow a rollover of pension payments to a spousal RRSP<sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a></sup> and tax free transfer of one spouse's RRSP to the other spouse's RRSP on
death.<sup><a href="#twenty">20</a></sup>
<p>
Last are the provisions which work to the detriment of the marital or family unit. These are designed to limit or reduce the tax-delivered or directly delivered benefits or increase the tax liability of individuals. These rules generally require that family income be aggregated to determine eligibility for payments. Specifically the provisions are: the refundable goods and services tax credit for lower-income Canadians;<sup><a href="#twenty1">21</a></sup> provincial property and sales tax credits;<sup><a href="#twenty2">22</a></sup> and the recently introduced child tax benefit which targets low-income families with children.<sup><a href="#twenty3">23</a></sup> This will be payable monthly to eligible individuals, generally to mothers. There
is also the rule that each family can have only one principal residence exemption from capital gains taxation.<sup><a href="#twenty4">24</a></sup> The current Canadian system, while theoretically an
individual-based system of taxation, is in reality a modified-individual tax unit. 
<p>
2. UNITED STATES SYSTEM
<p>
<i>a.  Evolution of the American System</i><sup><a href="#twenty5">25</a></sup><br>
It is virtually impossible to analyse the current American system of taxation without looking at its evolution. In the United States, the early income tax statute, adopted in 1913, required each person to report his or her own income. The main challenge that destroyed the American separate tax system was the taxation of spouses living in states which had inherited community of property systems through their exposure to Spanish or French civil
law.<sup><a href="#twenty6">26</a></sup> Their laws reflected the concept that marriage was a partnership with each spouse entitled to a present interest in half of the marital property and income, although in practice the husband had complete control. Because of the enormous tax savings that could be generated by income-splitting, there were
many court challenges to the concept of separate taxation. In 1930, the United States Supreme Court held in <cite>Poe v. Seaborn</cite><sup><a href="#twenty7">27</a></sup> that a husband's earnings in a community property state were subject, by law, to his wife's one-half interest. Each spouse, therefore, was taxed on one-half the
community income. In the same year, the same court in <cite>Lucas v. Earl</cite><sup><a href="#twenty8">28</a></sup> decided that a husband in a common law or separate property state was taxed on the full amount of his income, even though under a contract with his wife she held a one-half interest in that income. The inequity between these two decisions led to 
<blockquote>
widespread feelings of unfairness and almost twenty years of legislative chaos. Husbands from common law states felt disadvantaged compared to their counterparts from community property states who paid much lower taxes on the same income.<sup><a href="#twenty9">29</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Finally in 1948, in an attempt to alleviate the criticisms and in a desire to reduce taxes substantially after
World War II, Congress decided to extend the benefit of full income-splitting to all married couples.
<p>
Although it was hoped that this new regime would solve the tax unit issue forever, problems soon reappeared. Widowed, divorced, and single persons with dependents resented having to pay much higher taxes than married people;<sup><a href="#thirty">30</a></sup> the &quot;marriage bonus&quot; or &quot;single's penalty&quot; resulted in single persons sometimes paying as much as 42 percent higher taxes than married persons with the same income.<sup><a href="#thirty1">31</a></sup> Pressure mounted on Congress to mitigate the harshness of the system and Congress responded in 1969 with four different tax rate schedules: one for married couples filing jointly,
another (higher one) for married couples filing separately, one for singles, and one for heads of households. Although the lowest rate schedule was still for married couples filing jointly, the gap was closed between singles and married couples so that spouses no longer received the equivalent of full splitting. On the contrary, many
couples with both spouses in the labour force now found that their tax burden increased when they married and there was an outcry by two-income couples against this new &quot;marriage penalty&quot; in the tax system. The penalty was incurred by the marriage of two income-producing individuals. It arose when each spouse contributed
at least 20 percent of the couple's total income and was greatest when the incomes of the two spouses were equal.<sup><a href="#thirty2">32</a></sup> Congress responded in 1981 with an earned income deduction for lower-income spouses.<sup><a href="#thirty3">33</a></sup>
<p>
<i>b.  Current American System</i><br>
The debate over the tax unit continues; American tax theorists are generally critical of the American regime. The
current American system has four rate schedules and the complications that arise due to the difficulties involved in
determining which of the four tax schedules to use are legion. The authors of a 1989 article spend 86 pages detailing the complexities.<sup><a href="#thirty4">34</a></sup> The complexity in the American system is due not only to the four rate schedules, but also to the tendency of legislators over the years to add amendments that have the effect of appeasing the current annoyingly squeaky wheel. The development of tax policy in this area in the United
States has been dominated by the phenomenon of assuaging an alienated segment. Professor Bittker characterizes the debate over the tax unit in the United States as a constant procession of different groups of people moving &quot;to the centre of the stage in the ever changing but never ending drama entitled `Victims of Tax Injustice.'&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty5">35</a></sup> Even though he recommends a return to the individual as
the unit of taxation, he nonetheless recognizes the political impossibility of achieving a reform that would raise the tax burden of most married people. Reforms are hampered by the large number of under-taxed one-earner couples with enormous political clout.<sup><a href="#thirty6">36</a></sup> Consider the comments of James Baker when he was Secretary of the Treasury in 1985: &quot;We are living in a pro-family society and any social or economic policy that does not recognize the importance of the American family is doomed to failure.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty7">37</a></sup> One of the lessons for Canada is that the choice
of the family as the unit of taxation creates a host of problems including the dilemma of allocating tax burdens between single and married persons.
<p>
3. DIFFERENT CONCEPTIONS OF THE FAMILY UNIT: <cite>CARTER V. OLDMAN</cite>
<p>
While the family unit has often been presented as if it were a single, well-defined policy option, there has nonetheless been controversy and confusion over what effect its implementation will have and how this effect can be justified. In 1960, Oliver Oldman and Ralph Temple, two American law professors, recommended that the
most suitable unit of taxation was the married couple.<sup><a href="#thirty8">38</a></sup> Following from this basic premise, they developed a hierarchial structure on which a taxation system should be based:
<p>
1) An unmarried person should pay the same or greater tax than a one-income married couple with equal income;
<p>
2) A one-income married couple should pay higher tax than a dual-income married couple with equal income; and
<p>
3) A two-income married couple should pay more than two single persons with the same total income. 
<p>
The rationale for assigning the relative burdens of taxation between single and married persons was that a married couple having the same total income as two single people should have a heavier tax burden based on the economic advantages of joint living. One single person with the same income as a married couple should pay a greater tax since the advantages of joint living are never so great that two can live more cheaply than one. Essentially the basis for the recommendation was an ability-to-pay argument based on the economies of scale of joint living arrangements which increase the aggregate level of discretionary income when compared with those levels before
marriage. The rationale did not adequately establish that the family's income is a proper measure of the individual family member's ability to pay. The underlying assumption that family income is pooled and shared within the family was not stated and therefore not properly supported by reasoning and empirical evidence.
<p>
In 1966, the Carter Commission published a report which followed Oldman and Temple's recommendations with one modification: a one-income married couple and a dual-income married couple should be treated similarly---there should not be a difference in the tax burden between one and two-income married couples with the same
income. They rejected the suggestion of imputing income in kind for the value of the housework done by the stay-at-home spouse.<sup><a href="#thirty9">39</a></sup> This change simply made the family unit politically feasible: a tax system which taxed housewives would undoubtedly be too controversial to implement. 
<p>
The Carter model achieves horizontal equity (that equal-income couples should pay the same amount of tax without regard to the source of the income or division between the spouses),<sup><a href="#forty">40</a></sup> but compromises on no &quot;tax on marriage.&quot;  The &quot;tax on marriage&quot; is a result of the Commission recommendation of two rate structures: one schedule with a higher tax rate for family units and a second schedule with a lower tax rate for individuals.<sup><a href="#forty1">41</a></sup>
<p>
It is instructive that the &quot;tax on marriage&quot; (at the higher-income levels) was the main reason given by the government of Canada for not supporting the taxation of the family as a unit. The other reason was that the effect of taxation of the family as a unit would generally be to subject the woman's income to a higher rate of
tax than it would have borne if she were single. In the <cite>White Paper</cite> on tax reform in 1969,<sup><a href="#forty2">42</a></sup> and in the legislation that followed in 1971,<sup><a href="#forty3">43</a></sup> the government rejected aggregation of all income of married persons and joint filing at the time, but left open the
question of a future shift to the family as the unit of taxation.<sup><a href="#forty4">44</a></sup>
<p>
The Carter Commission presented an economic justification to defend its proposals. The Commission's position was that a fair taxation system must be based on the ability-to-pay principle and that the object of a progressive tax system and graduated rates is to redistribute income appropriately from those who have more to those who have less. The Commission recommended the adoption of the family as the unit of taxation, primarily on the ground that the family is &quot;the basic economic unit in society&quot;<sup><a href="#forty5">45</a></sup> and thus determines the ability to pay. Like Oldman and Temple, the Commission failed to support this conclusion by showing that the &quot;pooling and sharing&quot; of family income which they implicitly assumed occurs within the family actually does occur. 
<p>
A decade later, in a 1977 article, &quot;Taxation of the Family in Comprehensive and Simplified Income Tax,&quot;<sup><a href="#forty6">46</a></sup> Professors McIntyre and Oldman strongly advocated not
only allowing income-splitting for married persons, but returning to a conceptually pure system of taxation in which all the concessions for single, widowed, and divorced persons should be eliminated. The McIntyre and Oldman system would remove any &quot;tax on marriage&quot; but impose a &quot;tax on remaining single.&quot;  The &quot;tax on remaining single&quot; is a result of a 50/50 attribution of income between the spouses, each of whom will be taxed as a single individual. This permits a single taxpayer to save tax by marrying someone with no
income or less income.
<p>
The economic justification presented by Professors McIntyre and Oldman is an interesting counterpoint to the Carter Commission justification. McIntyre and Oldman also base their model on an ability-to-pay principle; however, they come to very different conclusions than Carter. In their view, the family is the economic cornerstone of society and each family member should be taxed on the items s/he actually consumes or accumulates, regardless of source. They recommend that each family member, including children, should be taxed on the benefit they enjoy from the family income. In their view the correct way to distribute the benefit of the income is to attribute 50 percent to each of the marital spouses because this approximates the reality of the family as an economic unit. They
reject Carter's economy of scale argument as inadequate and based on insufficient data. They propose the benefit rule as a normative model for taxation of the family. However, as is shown below in the `Pooling and Sharing' section, the empirical evidence for Oldman and McIntyre's explicit assumption that 50-percent attribution approximates the reality of the modern family is lacking; in light of the evidence that does exist, the conclusion is highly suspect. Until this assumption can be established with more than assertions, justifications for using the family unit will be fundamentally flawed.
<p>
<h3>III.  Choice of a Taxation Unit---What Is the Best Unit?</h3>

1. UNDERSTANDING GENERAL CONCEPTS OF TAXATION
<p>
Policy choices in an area as complex and difficult as taxation can be obscured in jargon and mired in the details of an increasingly complex statute. My purpose is to examine the options involved in choosing a taxation unit and to evaluate these options. Because this policy choice will affect all areas of the taxation system, the options available must be assessed according to the system's overall objectives. The simplest way to do this is to judge both of the possible taxation units under what are generally considered to be the broad goals of a taxation system: fairness,
neutrality, and simplicity.
<p>
In the following pages, I will first briefly discuss the ideas of fairness, neutrality, and simplicity and then show how these differing goals produce difficult policy choices. I will go on to analyse in detail both units of taxation using each of these three objectives.
<p>
<i>a.  Equity</i><br>
Equity in a taxation system has two dimensions: vertical and horizontal. &quot;Vertical equity&quot; is achieved when people at different income levels pay suitably different taxes. Many difficult fundamental choices abound in this area, chiefly the appropriate progressive rate structure, ranging from a mildly progressive rate structure to a steep curve.<sup><a href="#forty7">47</a></sup> Fundamentally, the objective of vertical equality is to ensure an equitable distribution of the burdens of taxation in a manner that reflects in a general way the broad ability to pay.
<p>
 &quot;Horizontal equity&quot; is the premise that people in equal positions should be treated alike. It means essentially that people (either individuals or families) with the same income and/or ability to pay should pay the same tax. At a simplistic level, the concept of horizontal equity means that A and B, a married couple each with
an income of $20,000, should pay the same tax as C and D, a married couple with an income of $40,000, earned entirely by C while D is a stay-at-home spouse. The concept of horizontal equity raises the issue of the distribution of the income between the spouses.
<p>
However, the concept of horizontal equity also raises the issue of how to deal with &quot;imputed income.&quot;  Imputed income arises whenever a person &quot;who owns productive assets, or who supplies productive services, uses them directly to produce goods and services that he consumes himself.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty8">48</a></sup> One example of imputed income is the rental value of a house which an owner occupies. The owner's economic power, or ability to pay tax, is greater because of the rent which she does not have to pay. Imputed income arises in the context of the taxation of the family when a stay-at-home spouse provides services to her family. Imputed income raises several issues: do the two couples above, A and B and C and D, have the same ability to pay tax?  If not, how should the income tax system deal with the differences?  This problem has
confounded generations of tax policy experts and remains a current Canadian issue in the debate on the tax unit.
<p>
Fairness---the broad rubric which encompasses both vertical and horizontal equity ---also applies to the choice of the unit of taxation. It demands that justice be done in the allocation of taxation burdens and benefits within a society. From this consideration comes the general principle, agreed upon by most theorists, that the way to apportion the burdens of taxation is through ability to pay.<sup><a href="#forty9">49</a></sup> More specifically, taxes are considered to be equitable when they are levied according to a defined tax capacity. The project then becomes one of choosing the tax unit which best suits this purpose---the tax unit most appropriate for assessing a person's ability to pay.
<p>
<i>b.  Neutrality</i><br>
The concept of &quot;neutrality&quot; in a tax system is generally held to mean that taxation considerations should not influence behaviour: the tax system should affect life and market choices as little as possible. Specifically, the tax unit should not affect the decision to marry or to work outside the home. While the meaning of neutrality is straightforward on one level---tax considerations should not influence decisions to marry or work outside the home---on another level it is far from absolute. The concept of neutrality is closely tied to the shared values of society and to current social norms. An example of this is society's reactions, at various times, to disincentives to labour force participation by wives. Discussions of whether neutrality in its widest context should always be a goal of a sound tax system are beyond the scope of this article. In my judgment the tax system should not punish or reward people for a decision to marry or to work outside the home.<sup><a href="#fifty">50</a></sup>
<p>
With respect to the decision to marry, in order for the income tax system to achieve a marriage-neutral stance, it should not impose a &quot;tax on marriage&quot; (tax disincentive for marriage) or a &quot;tax on remaining single&quot; (tax incentive for marriage). No &quot;tax on marriage&quot; means that two single taxpayers should pay no more tax if they marry. Thus, A and B, two single taxpayers each with an income of $20,000 should not pay more income tax when they marry and have an aggregate income of $40,000 than when they were single. No &quot;tax on remaining single&quot; means that a single person should not be able to save tax by marrying someone who has no income or less income. In order to have no &quot;tax on remaining single,&quot; C with an income of $40,000 should not pay less tax when she marries D who has no income or income of less than $40,000.
<p>
<i>c.  Simplicity</i><br>
Tax systems are becomingly increasingly complex. In my view, the goal of simplicity in a tax regime is an important one. A sound tax system is one that is reasonably easy for the taxpayer to comply with and for the tax authorities to administer. It is unlikely that a tax system will be accepted as fair if the average person cannot comply easily. Ease of compliance is critical in a self-reporting system.
<p>
Administrative simplicity is an important practical matter. If the cost of administering the system exceeds the revenue generated, the overall aim of revenue generation to meet government needs is defeated. Simplicity considerations encompass the costs of administering either an individual or a family system of taxation. The attribution rules are generally thought to be necessary to maintain the integrity of an individual system of taxation. They are, however, a source of complexity. On the other hand, defining the family unit would be necessary to a family system of taxation. This means that both units of taxation would demand similarly complex tax regimes. 
<p>
The three goals of fairness, neutrality, and simplicity are not discrete and separate considerations. They intersect and impact upon each other in complex and multiple ways. For example, the attribution rules, which I have chosen to discuss under the heading of administrative feasibility, raise fairness issues.
<p>
<i>d.  Social Policy Choices Implicit in the Choice of a Tax Unit</i><br>
One of the reasons that the problem of who is to be taxed has proven to be so intractable over the years is that there is an essential conundrum in the choice between the individual and the family. The dilemma is that, given a progressive rate structure, neutrality with respect to the decision to marry is incompatible with a regime of equal taxes for equal-income couples. Either horizontal equity or neutrality must be sacrificed. The phenomenon can be
illustrated by the following widely used criteria for a tax system:<sup><a href="#fifty1">51</a></sup>
<p>
1) a progressive rate structure;
<p>
2) payment of the same amount of tax by equal-income couples (without regard to the source of the income or division between the spouses);
<p>
3) no &quot;tax on marriage&quot;---two single persons pay no more tax if they marry; and
<p>
4) no &quot;tax on remaining single&quot;---a single person saves no tax by marrying someone who has no income or less income.
<p>
The criteria are chosen to reflect the concepts of vertical equity (1), horizontal equity (2), and neutrality (3 and 4).
<p>
There is no pattern of taxation that can be devised without eliminating one of the four criteria. The incompatibility of these criteria can be illustrated by the following example.<sup><a href="#fifty2">52</a></sup>
<blockquote>
Assume that A, B, C, and D are single individuals; A and B have equal incomes of $10,000 each; C earns $20,000; and D has no income. Let T(A), T(B) and T(C) represent the tax liability of A, B and C respectively. If the tax system is progressive . . . then (1) T(C) $ &gt; $ T(A) + T(B). Now assume that A and B marry and that C and D marry. If, under the second criterion, equal-income married couples pay the same tax, then (2) T(AB) = T(CD). Finally, the third criterion, marriage neutrality, requires that (3) T(A) + T(B) = T(AB) and that (4)  T(C) = T(CD). Substituting equations (3) and (4) into equation (2) yields T(A) +  T(B) = T(C). This, however, contradicts equation (1). Thus, equations (2), (3), and (4) cannot exist simultaneously in a tax system with a progressive rate schedule. [Horizontal equity (equation 2) and neutrality (equations 3 and 4) cannot be achieved without violating a progressive rate structure (equation 1).]
</blockquote>
The implications of the choice of taxation unit are thus very stark. All aggregation systems achieve horizontal equity (equal income couples pay equal tax) but compromise on neutrality (there is either a &quot;tax on marriage&quot; or a &quot;tax on remaining single&quot;); all individual systems necessarily compromise on horizontal
equity<sup><a href="#fifty3">53</a></sup> but achieve neutrality. The only way in which a tax system can be simultaneously progressive and neutral on the marriage decision is if married and unmarried people are taxed on exactly the same basis, and this of course will lead to horizontal inequity. Both units will create similar levels of complexity to administer, so simplicity considerations do not solve the problem. An understanding of the inevitably difficult choices in the selection of a tax unit is fundamental to an understanding of the evolution of tax systems.
<p>
2. ANALYSIS OF THE TAXATION UNITS UNDER THREE TAXATION OBJECTIVES
<p>
<i>A.  Fairness</i><br>
Fairness considerations require that the tax unit chosen be the most appropriate one to assess a person's ability to pay. The question that this part of the article will attempt to answer is, &quot;What is the unit of Canadian society which best reflects the ability to pay, the individual or the family?&quot;
<p>
<i>a.  Pooling and sharing</i><br>
If the family is chosen, the fundamental reason must be that the family's income best reflects the ability to pay rather than the individual family member's income. This then assumes a pooling and sharing of assets as the norm. It also assumes equal control of the assets by the marital couple. As Jack London, at one time a strong proponent of the family as the unit of taxation,<sup><a href="fifty4">54</a></sup> stated in a 1979 article, &quot;[t]he entire debate [over the unit of taxation] hinges on the accuracy of&quot; the statement that
<blockquote>
the reality of the family . . . is one of economic mutuality which, though it varies in degree from unit to unit, is one sufficiently meshed economically, ordinarily, to consider it a unit for purposes of determining taxpaying capacity.<sup><a href="#fifty5">55</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Many writers in this area tend to assume that there is economic mutuality within the family, based on their intuitive sense of the practice of sharing.<sup><a href="#fifty6">56</a></sup> Most commentators, if they view the issue
critically, admit that this assumption has not been verified in the literature. However, many commentators gloss over this fundamental tenet. Typical of this latter approach is the statement by McIntyre and Oldman that married couples should be assumed to share their income equally because &quot;common experience suggests that at least
partial pooling of sources to finance community consumption is almost universal.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty7">57</a></sup> Louise Dulude points out that McIntyre and Oldman's support for this statement was &quot;a 1965 article based on unsupported statements of various sociologists in the 1950s and early 60s (the most up-to-date reference being a book entitled <cite>Building a Successful Marriage</cite>).&quot;<sup><a href="fifty8">58</a></sup>
<p>
Some commentators do not assume complete sharing but take an intermediate position that married couples share consumption, if not income. Accordingly, &quot;the wealth and well-being---and thus the amount of discretionary income of a married person---relates to the couples' income, not to individual circumstances.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty9">59</a></sup> From this the conclusion is drawn that the marital unit is the most appropriate economic unit for a taxation system based on an ability-to-pay principle. While I would agree that the position that married couples share consumption to some degree is more defensible than complete sharing, I do not agree that this leads inexorably to the conclusion that the married couple is the most appropriate tax unit based on ability to pay. While members of a spousal unit may share current income, there is no evidence that they share savings. And even the assumption that spouses share a current income may be optimistic. While it is clear, for example, that spouses live in the same accommodation, there is no evidence that the remaining elements of a standard of living are equally shared. Different amounts may be spent on recreation and food outside the spousal dwelling. With respect to the issue of pooling and sharing, more intellectually rigorous commentators admit that unequal sharing with respect to intra-family distribution may be as plausible as equal sharing.<sup><a href="#sixty">60</a></sup>
<p>
There is minimal literature on how income and assets are shared by spouses. The only serious survey that I have found in the literature is by Jan Pahl---in Great Britain---as cited by Dulude in her article.<sup><a href="#sixty1">61</a></sup> Pahl concluded that &quot;there is a considerable amount of evidence to suggest that such sharing of income cannot be taken for granted.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty2">62</a></sup> She found four
standard patterns of money management which were characteristic of different types of families: 
<ol>
<li><i>the whole wage system</i>, characteristic of families living on social assistance or social security. Under that system, the husband hands over his salary or benefit cheque to his wife who manages all their financial affairs.
<p>
<li><i>the allowance system</i>, typical of families where the wife stays home and the husband gives her an &quot;allowance&quot; or &quot;wage,&quot; not so much related to the husband's actual income as to some community norm of an appropriate sum. Sometimes, the husband keeps back as much as half of his income.
<p>
<li><i>the pooling system</i>, mainly characteristic of newly married couples where both husband and wife are earning.  &quot;The pooling system also seems to be more common among those who have received a longer than average education.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty3">63</a></sup> However, even where both spouses are employed, the spending patterns do not always give the wife equal financial power. Her earnings are often used for household expenditures, while the man keeps more of his money for personal use and for savings.
<p>
<li><i>the individual control system</i>, which is still quite rare, gives both spouses who are very well off full control over their individual sources of earned or unearned income.
</ol>
What are the conclusions to be drawn from this?  &quot;[C]ouples with very low incomes do share everything because they have no choice. . . . [S]pouses who each have substantial incomes and assets do not tend to share much at all. Among middle-income people, sharing seems most common when the spouses are young and have similar
incomes and least frequent when the wife has no income and stays home.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty4">64</a></sup> It appears that sometimes spouses pool and share all or most of their incomes and
assets; more often they do not. In fact, with the exception of families who live at subsistence levels, the earnings and assets of couples who have choices are generally controlled and managed by the spouse who has legal title to them.
<p>
Margrit Eichler, a Canadian sociologist, is critical of the universality of the concept of economic mutuality within families. In a 1988 book, <cite>Families in Canada Today: Recent Changes and Their Policy Consequences</cite>, she commented on the validity of the idea of family income as follows:
<blockquote>
the concept of family income in most instances misrepresents actual circumstances. The majority of income in Canada is <i>not</i> family income, but is, instead, income of individuals who tend to be members of families. . . . It is important to realize that . . . individual income is under the control of the income earner. Economists <i>assume</i> that income that is paid to one family member benefits all family members, but this remains an assumption. While in many cases it is probably a correct assumption, in others it is likely inappropriate. It tells us nothing about who disposes of income for what purposes, since information on how money within families is spent is exceedingly sparse. . . . [A]s an indicator of access to income of individual family members, family income as a variable is not particularly useful.<sup><a href="#sixty5">65</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The phenomenon of non-economic mutuality within families was also pointed out in the recent report of the Women and Taxation Working Group of the Fair Tax Commission.<sup><a href="#sixty6">66</a></sup> They report that
<blockquote>
[t]he study of . . . intra-family distributions has been very limited. The available evidence suggests there is a complex process of resource allocation within families resulting in a variety of arrangements. It confirms that not all women in couple relationships have complete access to, or equal control over, the income of the other spouse. As a result, the assumption that all income is pooled is misleading.<sup><a href="#sixty7">67</a></sup>
</blockquote>
There is one statistical piece of information which is helpful in this debate, however. The trend in Canada is that an increasing portion of the after-tax income of the average Canadian family is available for individual spending choices. Statistics Canada figures show that the average Canadian family in 1990 spent only 35 percent of after-tax income on food, shelter, and clothing.<sup><a href="#sixty8">68</a></sup> The figure in 1978 was 45 percent spent on these three items.<sup><a href="#sixty9">69</a></sup> Therefore in 1990 the average Canadian family had 65 percent, or two-thirds, of income available for individual expenditures. While this percentage has probably decreased since the recession in the early 1990s, the overall trend is still clearly towards greater non-essential expenditure. Furthermore, considerable evidence exists to show that couples do not generally share important capital and savings holdings such as business assets, savings, retirement funds, and pension rights.<sup><a href="#seventy">70</a></sup>
<p>
There is no solid evidence that pooling and sharing are the norm in the Canadian marital unit; the data that is available seems to point to the conclusion that married couples do not share their income equally. All aggregate systems are based on the assumption of economic mutuality. The foundation of economic mutuality is questionable; the only evidence supporting pooling and sharing is anecdotal evidence, personal opinion, and intuition.<sup><a hef="#seventy1">71</a></sup> The concrete evidence points to the fact that most married couples tend to act as independent individuals with respect to a significant portion of their income. It does not seem wise to base a system of taxation on anecdotal evidence and intuition.
<p>
<i>b.  Economies of scale</i><br>
The concept of economies of scale played a large part in the Carter Commission recommendation that the family unit should pay more taxes than comparable individual units. Economies of scale refer to savings that families enjoy as a result of joint living arrangements. The married couple will enjoy economies of scale in consumption; a single home is cheaper to maintain than two establishments, and the duplication of many other expenses, from toasters to newspapers, can often be avoided. Reductions in the cost of food are also typical. Therefore the Carter Commission suggested that the ability to pay of a married couple who enjoy these economies of scale is greater than two unattached individuals. The Commission recommended a separate rate structure for married couples which would
have allocated an additional tax burden on families of approximately 20 percent based on savings due to economies of scale.
<p>
A simple example illustrates how this occurs. A and B are married and each has an income of $20,000. C and D are two single individuals who each have an income of $20,000. A and B have the same total income as C and D, but A and B live together and C and D live separately. The Carter model of economies of scale dictates that A and B should pay more tax than C and D. However, E, a single individual with an income of $40,000, should pay more tax than A and B.
<p>
There are two problems with economies of scale as a concept for allocating taxation burdens. First, the theory of confining economies of scale to the marital unit is both over-inclusive and under-inclusive. The advantages of economies of scale are not limited to the spousal unit. Roommates can achieve these savings. In 1978, Gerzog reported that 62.5 percent of single persons in the United States share their homes with someone else.<sup><a href="#seventy2">72</a></sup> Therefore, taxing the marital unit at a higher rate based on economies of scale savings available to them does not accurately reflect the prevalent living conditions or the actual ability to pay tax for a significant portion of society. In this way the assumption is under-inclusive.
<p>
The assumption is also over-inclusive since not all spousal units can enjoy economies of scale. Commuting couples, for example, are forced to maintain separate residences and have the additional expense of commuting to be together on weekends because they are married. There are no figures available on the frequency of this arrangement; however, it is clear that the multiplicity of living arrangements make economies of scale a questionable basis for incorporation into rate schedules to allocate tax burdens. As McIntyre and Oldman said in 1977, &quot;[t]he great variety of living arrangements which now characterize our society undermines the economies of scale argument for persons above the subsistence level. Generalities about economies of scale are no longer useful . . . .&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy3">73</a></sup> It is interesting to note that Oldman had been the co-author of the original economies of scale theory.
<p>
Second, it becomes more and more difficult to determine the extent of economies-of-scale savings as income levels rise above subsistence. To determine the amount of cost-of-living advantage that married couples enjoy as a result of joint living arrangements, tax theorists usually look to government cost-of-living indices for households of various sizes. Statistics Canada has developed indices of low-income cut-offs for cities of different sizes and rural areas. The cut-offs are used to classify families as poor or non-poor. They focus only on the minimum cost of living for various households. For example, the 1989 figures suggest that a childless married couple living in a city with 500,000 or more inhabitants needs an income of $16,027 to be as well off as an unattached individual with an income of $12,148; that is 32 percent more income.<sup><a href="#seventy4">74</a></sup>
<p>
A tax theorist would then assume that a single person with $12,000 of income should pay the same tax as a married couple with $16,000 of income and proceed to extrapolate this saving to higher-income levels.<sup><a href="#seventy5">75</a></sup> Does it hold that a single taxpayer with income of $45,000 should pay the same tax as a married couple with income of $60,000?  Or that a single taxpayer with income of $75,000 can live as well,
and hence has about the same tax paying capacity as a married couple with $100,000 of income?  The absurdity of simply using a 32-percent addition to determine economies of scale advantages for higher income levels seems obvious.
<p>
However, it is not clear that more complex calculations will result in more meaningful comparisons. Changing the percentage of additional increase so it is not constant at middle and higher income levels is one suggestion. For example, using a 20-percent differential at middle-income levels and a 10-percent differential at high-income levels would yield the following results. A single taxpayer with income of $40,000 would be assumed to have the same
ability to pay tax as a married taxpayer with income of $48,000. At high income levels a single income of $100,000 would be judged equal to a married income of $110,000. This approach seems equally arbitrary.<sup><a href="#seventy6">76</a></sup> The basis of economies of scale may be persuasive for taxpayers at low income levels, but it is much less valid when comparing middle- and high-income households of various sizes. The usefulness of any such measure in drawing conclusions about the relative tax paying abilities of middle and high-income single and married persons is doubtful.
<p>
<i>c.  Horizontal equity and imputed income</i><br>
Horizontal equity is one of the fundamental problems in the area of taxation of the family. If the individual is chosen as the basic tax unit, the concept of horizontal equity, as it is commonly conceived, will be sacrificed. Horizontal equity is the concept that people in equal positions should be treated alike. More specifically, the criterion is stated as &quot;equal taxation for equal-income married couples.&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy7">77</a></sup> Under an individual taxation system distribution of income between the spouses will matter. The issue is most obvious in the case of a single income couple. The classic example to illustrate such inequity is: A and B, a dual-income couple, have an income of $30,000 each, while C and D, a one-income couple, have an income of $60,000 earned entirely by C while D is a stay-at-home spouse. Due to the progressivity of the tax rates, C and D will pay more tax than A and B. Horizontal equity will be sacrificed. Equal-income couples will be treated differently. Or put another way, two couples with equal ability to pay will be taxed at different levels. Is this true?  On a basic level, it is. However, a closer assessment of the situation reveals a much more complex reality. Do the two couples have equal ability to pay?  In Family C/D (made up of C and D), Mr C goes out to work and earns $60,000, and Mrs D stays home. In Family A/B (A and B), Mr A and Mrs B both work outside the home and each earns $30,000. While in monetary terms their incomes may be seen as equal, in reality the ability to pay is not the same. In Family A/B income is earned at the expense of essential household production. Essential household production will either not be performed in Family A/B, and therefore impose additional practical and psychic costs; or will be purchased in the market place, imposing further non-discretionary expenditures. In Family C/D, these extra costs do not arise because Mrs C remains at home performing these essential tasks. In effect, she produces
non-taxable income for the family. This income is referred to as imputed income or income in kind.
<p>
Since most tax theorists admit that the two families do not have equal ability to pay tax, the next question is how to deal with the inequities which arise. The most common solution offered to mitigate the unfairness is to include in the income base the value of the goods and services produced in the home. In fact, this was the recommendation offered by Douglas Hartle in a 1969 study prepared for the Royal Commission on the Status of Women in Canada.<sup><a href="#seventy8">78</a></sup> He suggested that an arbitrary amount for each individual's unpaid household work should be included in the tax base. His recommendation was that $2,000 of imputed income be included in the income tax base for every able-bodied man or woman with a tax credit of up to $2,000 for work outside the home.<sup><a href="#seventy9">79</a></sup> This was subsequently rejected by the Bird Report<sup><a href="#eighty">80</a></sup> on the basis that implementation would be too difficult. Perhaps more importantly, the Commission found it &quot;undesirable that a married woman who stays at home keeping house for her family and has no income of her own should be liable to a tax which her husband would have to pay.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty1">81</a></sup>
<p>
The problem of imputed income has proven to be intractable over the years. Generally, the reasoning is that the administrative problems in measuring the amounts and values of these goods and services, namely imputed income, make inclusion in the income tax base an impossibility. Proxies which have been put forward to resolve the issue of imputed income include a credit for all full-time workers;<sup><a href="#eighty2">82</a></sup> a lower rate of tax for the earned income of women;<sup><a href="#eighty3">83</a></sup> and discontinuance of the marital tax credit. Another suggestion made was that husbands should pay tax on the imputed income from women's household services. This was based on the assumption that, in many cases, husbands are the primary beneficiaries of this work.<sup><a href="#eighty4">84</a></sup> The outcome of these recommendations in the past has been that they were seen as either not administratively feasible,<sup><a href="#eighty5">85</a></sup> or politically unattractive.
<p>
The omission of imputed income from the tax base is partly reconciled in the view of some tax writers by the fact that the tax system does, albeit indirectly, take imputed income into account.<sup><a href="#eighty6">86</a></sup> The progressive rate structure has the effect of taxing the one-income couple more
heavily than the two-income couple. However, this is an arbitrary solution and certainly not specifically directed toward the issue.
<p>
To my mind, horizontal equity, as a fundamental tenet of a tax system, creates a plethora of unsolvable problems. Should one of the goals of our tax system be &quot;equal taxation of families with the same monetary income&quot;?  In my view, it should not. Unless the value of imputed income is included in the tax base, horizontal equity is not a rational, meaningful objective. Aggregation of monetary income applied to married couples is a poor measure of the ability to pay under equity criteria whenever the division of time between
production in the home and marketplace differs among married couples. A spouse, like other taxpayers, should be taxed on the income he or she owns and controls, since this best indicates his or her ability to pay.<sup><a href="#eighty7">87</a></sup>
<p>
<i>d.  Support of Children</i><br>
If the individual is chosen as the unit of taxation, the allocation of relative tax burdens might also result in inequities in the case of a family with children. Intuitively it does seem that this is a situation where the family would be a more feasible economic unit. Although the tax treatment of children is beyond the scope of this article, it is my view that the appropriate tax treatment of children is not to adopt the family as the unit of taxation. In my judgment, equity considerations are best met with a scheme of tax allowances to recognize the costs incurred by the family in raising children. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reports that, since 1974, there has been a tendency among its members to move away from tax deductions for children in favour of tax credits and, to an even greater extent, toward systems of cash transfers.<sup><a href="#eighty8">88</a></sup> Canada has been part of this trend, first in 1987 with its move from tax deductions to tax credits, and now in 1993 with the child tax benefit which targets low-income families with children. This will be payable monthly to eligible individuals, generally to mothers. Some groups are already decrying the plan as insufficient,<sup><a href="#eighty9">89</a></sup> and, predictably, others are viewing it as too rich.<sup><a href="#ninety">90</a></sup> Leaving the quantum of the benefit aside, the concept of the child tax benefit does seem to embody all the equity considerations and in my view is a better way to proceed than adopting the family as the unit of taxation.
<p>
<i>e.  Conclusions</i><br>
Fairness considerations dictate that whichever unit is chosen, the individual unit, the spousal or marital unit, or the
family unit, it should best reflect the ability to pay across Canadian society. Is the argument that the family is the economic unit of Canadian society persuasive?  Does an individual's marital status best define his or her ability to pay or does the income that each person owns and controls better reflect his or her ability to pay?
<p>
To be an accurate reflection of ability to pay, any aggregate system must display an economic mutuality; pooling and sharing must be the norm. The evidence that exists suggests that pooling and sharing may not be the norm except at the low end of the income scale where there are no choices about how income is spent.
<p>
Furthermore, if the decision is made that the unit of taxation will be the marital unit, the thorny problem of the allocation of tax burdens between single and married persons must be faced. Some acceptable basis must be found to allocate the different taxation burdens. If the Oldman II model is chosen (if there is to be only one rate structure this will be inevitable) inequities result. Let me illustrate: A and B each have an income of $40,000. However, A
is married to a stay-at-home spouse and as a result will pay taxes on only $20,000. With a progressive rate structure B will pay much higher taxes than A.<sup><a href="#ninety1">91</a></sup> This two-to-one ratio seems unduly harsh to the unattached individual and, on the other hand, unduly permissive to a one-income couple.<sup><a href="#ninety2">92</a></sup>
<p>
To achieve a more equitable arrangement there could be two rate structures: one for married couples and one for single persons. This is the other option, the Carter model. However, it is important to understand that the unstated premise for this model is also an equal attribution of income to family members on the basis of benefits received. The benefit argument, unstated and implicit in the Carter model, seems unpersuasive to legitimize income splitting for <i>all</i> married couples with respect to <i>all</i> income received by the spouses. Moreover, there must be a basis for the difference between the rate structures. The concept of savings due to economies of scale seems to be the primary candidate. However, the problems with the fit of this concept to the spousal unit appear to render it
largely unworkable. Like pooling and sharing, the concept of economies of scale only works at a subsistence level. Additionally, economies of scale are not confined to a spousal unit but may be realized in a multitude of joint living arrangements.
<p>
I conclude that the choice of the individual as the unit of taxation better reflects fairness considerations. Although the economic mutuality of the family may be intuitively appealing, on closer inspection the family is not the unit in Canadian society that best reflects the ability to pay. Also, if the marital unit is chosen there appears to be no equitable way to allocate the tax burdens between married and single persons.<sup><a href="#ninety3">93</a></sup> Each spouse should pay tax on the income he or she owns and controls, since this best indicates his or her ability to pay.
<p>
<i>B.  Neutrality</i><br>
The tax unit should affect life choices as little as possible, particularly in regard to decisions about marriage or
taking a job outside the home. At the most fundamental level, the choice of a tax unit has implications for the type of family structure that will be promoted and provided with economic incentives.
<p>
<i>a.  The decision of the secondary earner to work</i><sup><a href="#ninety4">94</a></sup><br>
Any aggregate system, regardless of the tax burden allocation, has a disincentive to the secondary earner (usually the wife) to work for pay outside the home. The aggregate system penalizes the two-income couple in two ways.<sup><a href="#ninety5">95</a></sup> First, when the secondary worker returns to work, &quot;the second salary is added to the first in computing the couple's combined taxable income, with the result that the first dollar of the second salary is taxed at the marginal rate applicable to the last dollar of the first salary.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety6">96</a></sup> A and B are married and A's income is taxed at the highest marginal rate of 50 percent. When B returns to paid employment her income will be taxed at A's marginal rate, not the lower rate which her income would normally attract. This is a source of inefficiency in an aggregate system; distorting secondary labour supply substantially reduces economic efficiency.
<p>
Second, &quot;on leaving home to take a job, the second spouse usually incurs expenses---for transportation, more formal clothing, lunches, etc.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety7">97</a></sup> ---that usually cannot be deducted.<sup><a href="#ninety8">98</a></sup>
<blockquote>
This results in a disparity between the couple's statutory income and their economic gain, which is then widened by the working spouse's inability to give as much time as formerly to maintaining the home, preparing meals, and shopping for bargains, so that the couple may have to hire [household help], eat more frequently in restaurants, and pay more for goods and services.<sup><a href="#ninety9">99</a></sup>
</blockquote>
This effect is exacerbated by the fact that prior to returning to paid employment, the single income couple was not taxed on the wife's work in the home since the value of goods and services produced in the home was not taxed. One critic of the American system offered an example---a married woman whose $10,000 salary yields a net of only $1,600.<sup><a href="#onehundred">100</a></sup> Because the income tax base ignores income from the products and services produced by the taxpayer in her home, this causes overproduction of goods and services in the home and is therefore inefficient.<sup><a href="#one01">101</a></sup>
<p>
The hybrid Canadian system with its array of marital credits and transfer of unused credits has the same effect. The non-refundable married credit is available to individuals in recognition of the support given to a low-income spouse. The maximum federal credit for 1993 is $915; the credit is reduced if the spouse's income exceeds $538. This means that the higher-income spouse's tax burden will be increased once the secondary spouse's income exceeds $538.
<p>
These burdens on the double income married couple are a deterrent to the employment of married women outside the home in an aggregate system. In theory, of course, the burden arises whether the &quot;secondary&quot; wage-earner is the husband or the wife, and hence falls on the couple jointly. However, in a society that takes the husband's job for granted and views the wife as the secondary wage-earner, it is reasonable to describe the existing state of affairs as biased against women.<sup><a href="#one02">102</a></sup> A non-neutral system encourages
economic dependency for women. 
<blockquote>
Most nonworking spouses are women who are economically dependent on their husbands. Thus, what is in form a gender-neutral favoritism of home production may in fact be a form of sex discrimination that tends to keep women economically dependent on men.<sup><a href="#one03">103</a></sup>
</blockquote>
With the change in most Canadian family law acts to shorter term support on dissolution of marriage and the
increasing rate of divorce in Canada, economic dependency of women is an issue which must concern us. Any system which encourages economic dependency is problematic.
<p>
However, some commentators allege that non-neutrality is not an issue with respect to the decision of women to work outside the home. They point to the labour force participation of married women which has increased phenomenally in the last 40 years. In 1941 the rate was four percent, at the time of the Carter Commission in 1961 the rate was 22 percent, and in 1985 the rate of participation was 55 percent.<sup><a href="#one04">104</a></sup> However, the increasing labour force participation rate for married women does not
refute the suggestion that the tax system affects those participation rates.<sup><a href="#one05">105</a></sup> We have no way of determining what the rates would be under a tax system that was neutral to the decision of the secondary worker to return to waged work.
<p>
<i>b.  The decision to marry</i><br>
An individual tax unit by its very nature is neutral to the decision to marry; an aggregate system is not. An aggregate tax system, if it is to be progressive, must either impose more tax on two single taxpayers if they marry (a &quot;tax on marriage&quot;), or allow a single person to save tax by marrying someone who has no income or less income (a &quot;tax on remaining single&quot;).
<p>
Some tax experts believe that the taxation system does not actually influence the decision to marry or to remain single. The research group for the Carter Commission was of this view. They accepted the statement of the British Royal Commission on Taxation, &quot;We are sceptical of the suggestion that men and women are dissuaded
from marriage by any such nice calculation of the financial odds.&quot;<sup><a href="#one06">106</a></sup> Even as late as 1990 some commentators were saying that, &quot;It is doubtful whether the tax consequences of marriage greatly influence the decision to marry.&quot;<sup><a href="#one07">107</a></sup>
<p>
However, this view seems out of touch with reality. The Swedish experience at the end of World War II provides one example. In Sweden at that time, there was a much higher tax burden on two-earner married couples compared to unmarried taxpayers due to the steep progressivity of the rate schedule. In 1960, the tax unit was extended to include common-law relationships to stop the increasingly widespread practice among upper-income couples of cohabiting without marriage.<sup><a href="#one08">108</a></sup>
<p>
The experience in the United States during the 1970s, after the 1969 change to alleviate the burden on single taxpayers which in turn created a tax on marriage for some taxpayers, is also instructive. A number of articles<sup><a href="#one09">109</a></sup> pondered the issue of coming to grips with the
non-neutrality of an aggregate system, including, &quot;The Marriage Penalty: The Working Couple's Dilemma&quot;<sup><a href="#one10">110</a></sup> and &quot;Marry in Haste, Repent at Tax Time: Marital Status as a Tax Determinant.&quot;<sup><a href="#one11">111</a></sup> The demands were for a return to an individual system of taxation because the taxation system was penalizing individuals for a decision to marry.
<p>
The above evidence would seem to suggest that tax considerations can influence decisions to marry. The current Canadian system, although an individual system, is also not neutral to the decision to marry. The most obvious evidence of this is the non-refundable married credit which is available to an individual who marries a low-income person. There are also a host of tax reducing provisions for couples that were mentioned earlier.<sup><a href="#one12">112</a></sup>
<p>
Beginning in 1993 the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite> will treat common-law couples as married for purposes of the 
<cite>Act</cite>.<sup><a href="#one13">113</a></sup> This introduction will do much to make the Canadian system neutral to the decision to marry.<sup><a href="#one14">114</a></sup>
<p>
<i>c.  Incentives for type of family structure</i><br>
The choice of a basic unit of taxpayer has implications for the type of family structure that will be promoted and provided with economic incentives. An aggregate system provides significant tax savings for a very particular type of family structure, not for all families. Families where one spouse earns enough income to support the family, and where the other spouse stays at home, are the main beneficiaries of an aggregate system. This is true no matter which burden allocation method is chosen because the value of the services of the stay-at-home spouse are not included in the tax base. Under the Oldman II model of burden allocation, not only is the value of the imputed income ignored, the income of the highly paid worker will be split in two and each spouse will then be taxed as an individual on only one-half of the income. The Carter model has the same effect of ignoring the value of the non-waged household and child care service and splitting the income between the spouses. There is a higher tax burden than under the Oldman II method (Carter recommended 20 percent), but there is still a significant economic benefit for the one-income family.
<p>
Since the stay-at-home spouse is commonly the wife and the highly paid spouse is more likely to be the husband, an aggregate system is providing tax incentives for a traditional family model comprised of a male income-earner who earns enough income to support the family (normally an affluent taxpayer) and a female stay-at-home spouse. The savings under any system of taxation that uses the family as the basic tax unit are enormous for this  quot;traditional
model&quot; family.
<p>
<i>C.  Simplicity</i><br>
The last goal I will consider is simplicity. A sound tax system is one which is reasonably easy for the taxpayer to comply with and for the authorities to administer.
<p>
<i>a.  Ease of compliance</i><br>
In a self-reporting system of taxation ease of compliance is crucial. In order for the average taxpayer to comply, she must grasp the underlying broad, general principles. For example, a tax system where taxpayers understand that they must file either jointly or individually is easier to comply with than one where there is a complex combination of individual and joint filing. Also, the public has difficulty grasping tax systems whose basic components are more
or less arbitrary. For example, if different rate structures are to be used, the basis for the rate structure should ideally be clear to the average taxpayer. Put most simply, it is easier to comply when you can grasp the rationale for the rule. It is unlikely that a tax system will be accepted as fair if the average person does not understand, albeit at an elementary level, the general underlying principles.
<p>
What do simplicity considerations dictate with respect to the choice of a unit of taxation?  The basis for the Canadian model of individual taxation is easily understood; so too is the Oldman II family model of taxation. The Carter model, with more than one rate schedule and the somewhat arbitrary basis for the allocation of tax burdens between the rate schedules, is less satisfactory in this regard. However, the Oldman II family model of taxation gives rise to inequitable tax burden allocations between single and married taxpayers which in turn can precipitate all the complexities of the American system. These considerations militate for the individual as the tax unit. While it can be argued that an individual system also can be subject to demands for reallocation of tax burdens,<sup><a href="#one15">115</a></sup> the pressure will be less severe because the system is much more equitable. While the number of rate schedules and the basis for those schedules are certainly not the only factors, nor even the major cause of complexity in income tax statutes,<sup><a href="#one16">116</a></sup> they are a consideration.
<p>
<i>b.  Ease of administration</i><br>
Administrative simplicity is a practical concern and an important one. If the cost of administering the system exceeds the revenue generated, the overall aim of revenue generation to meet government needs is defeated. Therefore the cost of administering either an individual or a family system of taxation must be considered. The attribution rules are generally thought to be a necessary component in maintaining the integrity of an individual
system of taxation. If the individual is chosen as the tax unit, taxation officials become involved in characterizing transactions and transfers between members of a family unit. The attribution rules attempt to prevent spouses from transferring property from one to the other in the hope of ensuring that the tax liability of the income accrues to the lower-income spouse. Most tax commentators believe that joint spousal taxation would simplify the administration of the tax system.<sup><a href="#one17">117</a></sup>
<p>
However, if the family is chosen as the unit of taxation, tax officials will become involved in a definition of who constitutes a family unit for the purposes of the <cite>Act</cite>, at a time when there may no longer be a tenable definition of the &quot;family unit.&quot;  In September 1992, an Ontario human rights tribunal held that same sex
couples will now be included in the definition of spousal unit.<sup><a href="#one18">118</a></sup> This ruling is, in my view, a harbinger of things to come and, if the family is chosen as the unit of taxation, eventually the determination of who constitutes a same sex couple must be made. Can adults living together as  &quot;roommates&quot; qualify as a family for purposes of income tax legislation?<sup><a href="#one19">119</a></sup> The definition of a family unit is becoming an increasingly contentious issue. This, in my view, is a trend that will continue; I do not see any abatement in the near future.
<p>
My conclusions regarding administrative feasibility of an aggregate system and an individual system are that both present very difficult administrative issues. The issues in this area, as they are presently defined, present no clear advantage for one unit of taxation over the other.
<p>
<i>D.  The Best Unit of Taxation:  Conclusions</i><br>
My conclusion, based on the three goals of fairness, neutrality, and simplicity, is that the best choice for the unit of
taxation is the individual. Neutrality considerations clearly dictate that the choice should be the individual; it is impossible for an aggregate system to avoid either tax incentives or disincentives for marriage. Simplicity considerations show no clear difference between the individual and the family as the unit of taxation. Perhaps with the attribution rules as they are currently structured, there is a slight bias toward the family as the more administratively feasible system. However, in my view, it is the fairness and equity considerations that are decisive. The available information shows that pooling and sharing, implicit assumptions in the choice of any aggregate system, are not the norm in many families. Furthermore, if the family is chosen as the unit of taxation, there must be an allocation of the tax burdens between single and married taxpayers. This is virtually impossible to do in an equitable manner.
<p>
The family was advocated as the unit of taxation by the Carter Commission. The Commission argued that the appropriate measure of ability to pay for family members is total family income. They argued that differences in the distribution of spousal income in a marriage should not result in variations in the tax payments of married couples with the same total income.  For the reasons I have outlined, chiefly the lack of fairness in any aggregate system, I believe these arguments are flawed.
<p>
There are two other arguments against adopting the spousal unit as the unit of taxation. First, the concept of a couple as a life-long economic unit with joint income, wealth, and expenses may no longer be appropriate in light of changing family structures, increasing divorce rates, and falling marriage rates.<sup><a href="#one20">120</a></sup>
<p>
 Second, using the couple as the tax unit is in conflict with the goal of women's autonomy as it does not recognize women as distinct from their relationships with others. Historically, the filing of joint tax returns for husbands and wives was necessary because women were legally incapable of acting for themselves.
<p>
<h3>IV.  Implications of the Best Tax Unit for the Canadian Tax System</h3>

1. PRESSURES FOR CHANGE
<p>
There are factors other than simple taxation policy involved in the choice of a unit of tax. For example, any discussion will inevitably be framed by the recommendation of the Carter Commission, which favoured an aggregation of marital income. The fascination in Canada with the family as the unit of taxation seems to be a result of this influential report. From my perspective, the Carter recommendations on the tax unit fell far short of a standard of excellence, and of their own stated criteria of fairness, neutrality, and simplicity.<sup><a href="#one21">121</a></sup> The Carter Commission, in my view, gave the concept of the family as the unit of tax an undeserved patina of respectability.<sup><a href="one22">122</a></sup> However, the weight of the view of the Carter Commission is undeniable.
<p>
Another factor which might influence the choice of tax unit is the growing importance of economic internationalism.<sup><a href="one23">123</a></sup> It is inevitable that there will be pressure for countries associated economically to integrate their taxation systems. We are living in a time when the economic ties between
Canada and the United States are becoming stronger. The American family system of taxation is intuitively appealing to many economists. Economic thought, and thus tax policy criteria, envision the operative units of economic activity as households or firms, not individuals. They believe that a family system of taxation is more
in accord with reality. The segment of the population that seeks to promote traditional family values will also be adherents to this view.
<p>
Finally, experience in the United States has taught us that the importance of judicial decisions should not be underestimated in this area of policy-making. Taxpayers can now use the equality provisions of the <cite>Charter</cite> to challenge separate taxation. Two recent cases, <cite>Schachtschneider</cite><sup><a href="#one24">124</a></sup> and <cite>Ross</cite>,<sup><a href="#one25">125</a></sup> both challenges to the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite> under s. 15 of the <cite>Charter</cite>, are examples of the increased litigation in this area. <cite>Schachtschneider</cite> challenged the equivalent-to-married tax credit. <cite>Ross</cite> challenged the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite> disallowance of a child-care payments deduction to an individual closely related to the child (the stay-at-home mother in this case) and the disallowance of the stay-at-home wife's claim to one-half the husband's income as her own. The potential for tax savings is an irresistible lure for high-income one-earner couples to use the judicial system to challenge an individual system of taxation.
<p>
The cumulative effect of these factors---the Carter Commission recommendation, growing economic internationalism, future judicial decisions, and the amendment-by-amendment move to the family unit of taxation---may reopen the debate on the aggregation of income.
<p>
2. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REFORM
<p>
In my judgment, it is important to undertake reform in this area, primarily to render the existing system more equitable, but also to mute calls for a change to an aggregate system. In Canada today the unit of taxation is the individual. However, the taxation system is increasingly recognizing the marital unit. Most commentators in this area bemoan the schizophrenic nature of the Canadian tax system. For example, Jack London in a 1988 paper said
that 
<blockquote>
[T]he federal income tax system . . . lacks an intellectually or rationally defensible perspective on whether married persons are, or ought to be, considered tax units requiring aggregation of their joint incomes from all sources.<sup><a href="#one26">126</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Maureen Maloney in 1989 stated that
<blockquote>
the Income Tax Act appears to have adopted the worst of both regimes:  its use of the individual as the basic tax unit reflects a desire to ensure equality, yet its manner of giving spousal deductions, unused reliefs, etc., undermines this aim.<sup><a href="#one27">127</a></sup>
</blockquote>
and further that
<blockquote>
[t]he unit of taxation should remain the individual and any movement toward recognition of the marital or family unit should be carefully watched and eliminated.<sup><a href="#one28">128</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Is this dual recognition of the individual and the married couple necessarily negative?  In my opinion, it is not. While I disagree that the duality in the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite> is necessarily wrong, I agree that there should be a principled basis for the decision to tax the spousal unit jointly or separately. In my judgment an individual-based system of taxation together with a family-based system of income maintenance is the most coherent, rational approach.<sup><a href="#one29">129</a></sup> Such a system is the best choice because it not only achieves the fairness of an individual system but it also recognizes family responsibilities at the lowest income levels. The rationale for adopting the spousal unit at subsistence levels is that there is economic mutuality in families at low income levels. I submit that such a system achieves the best of both regimes. Aggregation of income should be maintained for provisions that are designed to limit or reduce the tax-delivered or directly delivered benefits that families can claim. These include the child and sales tax credit. These are components of income maintenance that the government finds it convenient to administer, along with the personal income tax.
<p>
I would, however, recommend the repeal of all of the provisions that are designed to reduce tax liabilities of couple families, on the basis that they are not targeted at low-income families. These are the provisions which allow the high-earner spouse various credits (such as the married credit) and allow for the transfer of unused tax credits to the higher income spouse.
<p>
I am more ambivalent about my recommendation regarding the attribution rules, the provisions that are designed to maintain the individual as the tax unit.  On balance, I will recommend that these provisions should be left in place, but should be reconsidered.
<p>
<i>a.  Repeal of the marital credit</i><sup><a href="#one30">130</a></sup><br>
One of the current issues in the reform of the Canadian tax system is to repeal the marital credit. The history of the marital credit is important for two reasons. First, it reveals an underlying philosophy of encouraging dependency. Second, it provides evidence of the effects of non-neutral taxation provisions on the decision of the secondary earner to work outside the home. The married exemption was part of the <cite>Income War Tax Act</cite> that introduced income tax to Canada in 1917. Over the years the married exemption amount has generally been the same as the personal exemption amount. In 1925 an amendment to the married exemption was introduced that required one of the spouses to be &quot;dependent.&quot;  This was enforced by providing that the marriage exemption could be claimed only if the other spouse's income was less than $1500. This provision constituted a clear inducement to actual dependency.<sup><a href="#one31">131</a></sup> By 1942, the cap on married women's income had been lowered to $660. In 1942, the government amended the married exemption to induce married women to enter waged work by removing the $660 limit and the requirement for dependency. The goal was total mobilization of the labour force in World War II. In 1947, the limit was put back into the provision and the dependency requirements were re-enacted.<sup><a href="#one32">132</a></sup> In 1987, the married exemption deduction was converted into a tax credit.
<p>
Today, the marital credit is structured as a non-refundable credit available to a high-income spouse in recognition of the support given to a low-income spouse. I would recommend that the marital credit be repealed. It encourages the dependency of women and provides a disincentive to part-time or initial-level employment, since the first dollars earned are taxed at the husband's higher marginal rate. In 1989, the cost of this credit was approximately $1.5 billion dollars federally.<sup><a href="#one33">133</a></sup> The figure rises to approximately $2.4 billion when the value of the marital credit in the nine provinces and two territories is added.<sup><a href="#one34">134</a></sup>
<p>
The repeal of the marital dependency credit has often been suggested in the past. In 1970, the Canadian Royal Commission on the Status of Women concluded that
<blockquote>
[i]n all justice the married status exemption should not be given when there is no dependent in the family. We believe that a woman does not become economically dependent by virtue of her marriage. If she is in fact dependent, it is the result of the couple's personal choice. A childless couple has the right to decide that the wife will devote all her time to homemaking but there is no reason why the State should attach an advantage to this choice by giving the husband a married status exemption.<sup><a href="#one35">135</a></sup>
</blockquote>
In 1983, Judy Erola, who was then Minister Reponsible for the Status of Women, made the same recommendation. Her suggestion was met with a storm of protest and the government of the day was forced to bow to political pressure and withdraw it.<sup><a href="#one36">136</a></sup> Louise Dulude states that the main obstacle is &quot;housewives who, deprived of any compensation for their work, do not see the marital exemption as a denial of their economic value, but as the only measure in the tax act that grants them some recognition.&quot;<sup><a href="#one37">137</a></sup>
<p>
As recently as November 1992, the Fair Tax Commission's Working Group on Women and Taxation was split in its recommendation: one group believed the provisions should be eliminated; the other group that the provisions should be maintained, but the benefit delivered to the lower-income spouse.<sup><a href="#one38">138</a></sup>
<p>
I do not believe that the marital credit should be maintained. It is fundamentally flawed in its structure and it should be repealed. However, I do sympathize with the underlying concern of the Working Group that the benefits should not be withdrawn from low-income families. My recommendation would be to use a portion of the money to enrich the child tax benefit scheme to target low-income families with children. In my opinion, the repeal of the marital
credit is politically feasible at this time. Most Canadians seem to have accepted the need for the non-universality of programs such as family allowances.<sup><a href="#one39">139</a></sup>
<p>
<i>b.  Repeal of the Transfer of Unused Spousal Credits</i><br>
The second reform that should be undertaken is to repeal the transfer of unused spousal credits. The <cite>Income Tax Act</cite> presently allows the lower-income spouse to transfer unused tax credits to the higher-income spouse. These include the age amount, pension income amount, disability amount, and the tuition fees and education amounts. Also the transfer of dividend income to the higher-income spouse is permitted, if, as a result of this transfer, the higher-income taxpayer can increase his claim for the married credit. It is not possible to measure the cost of these provisions separately, given the available data. These provisions are designed to lower the tax liabilities of all families, not only lower-income families. In fact, the main beneficiaries of these rules are higher-income families. I would recommend their repeal on the basis that there is no rational basis for allocating tax savings to this group. In a time of increasing deficits, tax concessions should be specifically targeted.
<p>
<i>c.  Reconsider the Attribution Rules</i><br>
Reform of the current Canadian tax system demands that the attribution rules be reconsidered. My dilemma with the attribution rules is as follows: on the one hand repeal of these rules may facilitate transfer of property between spouses; on the other hand retention of the attribution rules may preserve the individual as the unit of taxation. If, and I stress this point, transfer of effective legal title and control were a condition, the result might be more financial autonomy for women and an incentive to adopt true sharing between the spouses. However, this effect is far from assured. Several commentators have wondered whether the effect of the repeal of the attribution rules would be an increased transfer of legal control. In these times of increasing instability of marriages, perhaps husbands would be loathe to transfer their properties to wives simply to reap tax savings. Professor Bittker comments on the American situation,
<blockquote>
Taxpayers pass up many opportunities to reduce their taxes by intrafamily gifts, possibly from ignorance or inertia, but perhaps because they attach more significance to their legal rights than academicians assert. The contemporary women's rights movement is a reminder of the long struggle for married women's property laws, whose underlying premise was that the division of legal rights between the husband and wife is a significant matter, not a trivial one.<sup><a href="#one40">140</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Other commentators assert that the presence of the attribution rules in the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite> is acknowledgement by the government that the family is the economic unit of society.<sup><a href="#one41">141</a></sup>
<p>
Some commentators believe that the attribution rules do not work. For example, Maureen Maloney states that
<blockquote>
[s]tringent though the attribution rules may first appear, they have in practice been easily and widely avoided. . . . As a consequence, the attribution rules have often only served to catch the unwary or uneducated, while allowing those who are able to afford good tax advice to escape them.<sup><a href="#one42">142</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Jack London in a paper in 1979, and a subsequent panel discussion on the &quot;Taxation of the Family,&quot; admits that his fundamental problem with the system of taxation in Canada as it existed at that point in time---with the individual as the unit of taxation and the pre-1985 attribution rules---was the inequities in the application of the attribution rules that he had seen as a tax practitioner. Persons with income from business or property were able to arrange their affairs so as to split their income with family members, but wage earners (usually less affluent) did not have the same possibility of income-splitting open to them.<sup><a href="#one43">143</a></sup>
<p>
The 1985 amendments to the attribution rules were much more restrictive, and much more complex.<sup><a href="#one44">144</a></sup> The three key differences between the new attribution rules and the old attribution rules were: first, the new provisions apply to loans of property as well as to transfers; second, the rules apply
not only to a transfer or loan to a person, but also to a transfer or loan that is &quot;for the benefit of&quot; a person; and third, the definition of substituted property was expanded and included shares received as stock dividends.<sup><a href="#one45">145</a></sup>
<p>
In the final analysis I am persuaded, in the face of many unknowns, that the attribution rules should be retained. I would, however, recommend that they be revisited to determine if the 1985 attempt to tighten the rules has succeeded. Also, the concept of repealing the attribution rules, subject to a transfer of effective legal title and control, should be studied to determine if it will facilitate a more equal sharing within families.
<p>
<h3>V.  Conclusions</h3>

The primary purpose of this article was to determine the best unit of taxation. In my judgment, individual taxation is the best system of taxation; it better meets the objectives of fairness, neutrality, and simplicity than taxation of the marital or spousal unit. Individual taxation is more in accord with the reality within families, particularly with respect to current behaviour in pooling and sharing of economic resources. The trend among the western industrialized countries has been toward the choice of the individual as the unit of taxation, and away from compulsory joint or family taxation.<sup><a href="#one46">146</a></sup> In my view, the economic unit in Canadian society that best reflects the ability to pay taxes is the individual.
<p>
A secondary, albeit unstated, objective of this article was to encourage the reader to make up his or her own mind on the best unit of taxation by presenting clearly the ideas and policy choices involved. The taxation system and the choices involved therein, especially with respect to the choice of the unit of taxation, imply very profound social policy choices. An understanding of these issues will leave the reader better prepared to participate knowledgeably in any upcoming debates on the tax unit in Canada.

On the one hand there is a rosy &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; picture of the family and on the other hand a much harsher, grittier reality of the lack of mutuality in families.

<li><a name="seventy9">Kathleen Lahey</a> is critical of the traditional analysis of imputed income and offers an alternative. &quot;Policy analysts have long believed that the tax exemption of women's nonwaged work from the tax base causes distortions, non-neutralities, and inequities among differently situated groups of taxpayers because it confers tax benefits on families that have such workers. Most policy analysts had always acted as if the nonwaged worker (women) `owned' that `imputed' income, and therefore was the taxpayer to whom it should be imputed. Indeed, this was one of the assumptions that had flawed the paper that Douglas Hartle had prepared for the Royal Commission on the Status of Women on the taxation of women. In contrast to this mainstream position, Jack London has made the suggestion that women should receive a money salary for this work, which would then make it possible to tax them on the value created without offending anyone's sense of fairness.&quot; K.A.

<p>
<li><a name="eighty2">This suggestion</a> was put forward by Gann, <i>supra</i> note 25 at 36-37. This would be a tax credit or allowance for employment income for all full-time workers, whether married or single, and scaled down for part-time workers. In Canada a tax deduction for employment income was repealed by the government, as yielding too large a revenue loss. Section 8(1)(a), an employment expense deduction, was introduced in 1972 and repealed in 1988.

<li><a name="eighty5">In fact</a>  the reality of imputed income is even more complex than the examples I have used. In Family A/B, a dual-income couple, assuming that women continue to bear a disproportionate share of housework, Mrs B may still be producing imputed income for the family despite working outside the home full-time. Conversely, in Family C/D, the fact that Mrs D stays at home does not necessarily mean that the family will not spend money on outside help for housework. These complications only add to the administrative impossibility of including imputed income in the income tax base.

II, 254 (1973) as cited in Bittker, <i>supra</i> note 25 at 1432. Mrs X is married to a man with an income of $15,000 per year. She is offered two jobs: an industrial job that promises long hours and pays $15,000 and a college teaching job with flexible hours and a salary of $10,000. Since Mrs X feels that she must bear primary responsibility for the home duties, she considers only the teaching job. Mrs X finds that family expenses will increase by $5,000 if she returns to work. Her income will be taxed at her husband's marginal rate. His taxable income is $8,000 so her first dollar will be taxed at 22 percent. Her employment will therefore
increase the family's federal income tax bill from $1,380 to $3,820 (1972 rates); her share of the bill is $2,440. If State and local taxes average five percent, her cost is $500. Social security taxes amount to another $486 (1972 rates). Mrs X's gross income will yield a net of $1,592.
<p>
<li><a name="one01">The overproduction</a> and inefficiency is illustrated by the following example from Gann, <i>supra</i> note 25 at 40. Assume that Y works 40 hours each week outside the home and is paid $10 per hour. Y pays a housekeeper $7 per hour for 10 hours of work each week. The Government then imposes a 40-percent tax on Y's earned income, and the wages paid to the housekeeper are non-deductible personal expenditures. After the imposition of the tax, Y should choose to work only 30 hours in the marketplace and work 10 hours at home in place of hiring the housekeeper. This replacement saves Y $1 for each hour replaced---the difference between Y's after-tax wage per hour, and the housekeeper's wage per hour. The welfare cost to society is $3 per hour, the difference in the before-tax wage of Y and the housekeeper.

<li><a name="one14">It is interesting</a> to note that the number of common-law unions has increased to the point that one in twelve couples now report living common-law.

In 1981, six percent of all couples, or about 352,000 families reported living in such unions. Target Groups Project of Statistics Canada, from Transition, June 1989.

<li><a name="one17">This was the reason</a> given by half of the members when the last official examination of Canada's tax unit was done in 1975--76 by a federal Interdepartmental Committee on the Taxation of Women. On the issue of the tax unit, the committee was split down the middle. Half of its members, led by the Revenue Department, supported joint spousal taxation because they found it fairer and thought it would simplify the administration of the tax system. The other members were equally adamant that only separate taxation was fair because joint taxation would discriminate against employed women and create an undesirable tax on marriage.

Based on the OECD report, <i>supra</i> note 88, and the hard data that the trend in Western industrialized countries since 1955 has been toward the individual as the unit of taxation and away from compulsory joint taxation, <i>ibid.</i> at 17, this assertion seems perplexing.
<p>
<li><a name="one22">It is interesting</a> to speculate on why the Carter Commission adopted its recommendation, but the truth is no doubt lost in the annals of history. Kathleen Lahey suggests that the Commission's recommendations on the taxation of the family represent a clear statement about the relative importance of families and women, and a blatantly sexist approach. She suggests that as long as women are subsumed within the conceptual units like the household and the family, tax policy criteria like equity, neutrality, and fairness do not apply to them. The family as the tax unit appears to have intuitive appeal to economists, who have been trained to think of the household as the smallest economic unit for most purposes. They tend not to notice that such thinking submerges women's roles and that by subsuming a weaker individual into a group, there is the inevitable economic domination by the stronger individual.

<h1> Standing to Challenge Searches and Seizures Under the <cite>Charter</cite>: The Lessons of the American Experience and Their Application to Canadian Law
<p> 
 JONATHAN DAWE</h1>
<p><br><center><h3>ABSTRACT / <a  href="http://www.law-lib.utoronto.ca/law-review/utlr52-1/dawe.htm">Fulltext</a></h3></center>

Taken together, s. 8 and s. 24(2) of the <cite>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite> allow persons whose right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures has been infringed to prevent any evidence seized from being used against them. The following question then arises: what is the extent of the right protected by s. 8?  While the Supreme Court has not conclusively answered this question, several provincial Courts of Appeal have followed the American case law in this area and adopted restrictive definitions of privacy accompanied by narrow rules of standing.

<h1> Standing to Challenge Searches and Seizures Under the <cite>Charter</cite>: The Lessons of the American Experience and Their Application to Canadian Law
<p> 
 JONATHAN DAWE</h1>
<p><br>
<i>Taken together, s. 8 and s. 24(2) of the </i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms<I> allow persons whose right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures has been infringed to prevent any evidence seized from being used against them. The following question then arises: what is the extent of the right protected by s. 8?  While the Supreme Court has not conclusively answered this question, several provincial Courts of Appeal have followed the American case law in this area and adopted restrictive definitions of privacy accompanied by narrow rules of standing. In this paper the author argues that the American approach is theoretically flawed and badly suited for incorporation into </i>Charter<i> jurisprudence. Instead, the author suggests, adopting a broader conception of the interests protected by s. 8 would help Canadian courts avoid the confusion and inconsistency of the American
doctrine. In addition, it is argued that a fully realized understanding of these interests would allow for a more coherent articulation of the principles of the s. 24(2) exclusionary remedy than is available under the existing doctrine.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

Section 8 of the <cite>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite><sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup> guarantees the right of Canadians to &quot;be secure against unreasonable search and seizure.&quot;<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup> When called on to define the extent of this right and, as a consequence,
the availability of the remedies provided by s. 24,<sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup> Canadian courts have often been presented with difficult interpretive choices. Although the jurisprudence developed since 1982 has established many key components of the framework of Canadian search and seizure doctrine, a number of important interpretive choices have yet to be made, and several significant issues remain unresolved. One problem that remains outstanding is often referred to as the question of &quot;standing:&quot;<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup> given that an unreasonable search and seizure has taken place, who is entitled to object to its constitutionality, and who can claim a remedy under s. 24?  Since s. 24 grants a remedy only to persons &quot;whose rights or freedoms . . . have been infringed,&quot; resolving the question of standing will often require an explicit or implicit determination of the scope of the right guaranteed by s. 8.
<p>
Although the Supreme Court of Canada has not conclusively addressed the issue of standing in search and seizure cases, many Canadian courts that have considered the matter have looked to the American jurisprudence for guidance, and have incorporated into their judgments varying aspects of the American doctrine on standing. Although the U.S. experience is often a valuable tool that can be used in analysing <cite>Charter</cite> issues, careful consideration must be given to the applicability of U.S. precedent to Canada. Even more importantly, courts must consider whether the path taken by American courts is one that <i>should</i> be followed in Canada, or whether public policy, constitutional theory, or both would be better served by a different approach. In the case of the problem of standing in search and seizure cases, it can be argued that the current U.S. doctrine is seriously flawed, and that Canadian courts should consider a different alternative. So far, however, Canadian courts have not done so; rather, the tendency in both the trial courts and the provincial courts of appeal has been to adopt the American doctrine on standing in search and seizure cases without critically analysing either the doctrine itself or its applicability to the situation under the Canadian Constitution. 
<p>
The numerous flaws in American Fourth Amendment<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup> jurisprudence have often been pointed out by commentators in the United States. In 1973, one observer noted that the situation was &quot;a mess&quot;<sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup>; by 1983 another commentator was moved to remark that &quot;the
situation has not improved&quot;<sup><a href="seven">7</a></sup> in the intervening years. Although another decade has now passed, the U.S. Supreme Court has done little to respond to these criticisms. Since the early 1970s the Court has adopted increasingly restrictive standing rules, based on an ever-shrinking conception of what constitutes a legitimate expectation of privacy. The effect has been a considerable limitation on the situations where the Fourth Amendment can be appealed to and the exclusionary rule invoked. At the same time, the Court has characterized the exclusionary rule as being intended solely as a means of police control. The incoherence of this state of affairs is evident---if the purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter police misconduct, it hardly makes
sense not to exclude evidence in cases of flagrant police misbehaviour solely because the applicant cannot tie the misconduct sufficiently closely to a violation of his or her individual privacy interests. This has been pointed out by Professor Doernberg, who comments:
<blockquote>
When the Court speaks of fourth amendment rights, it speaks only of individuals; when it speaks of remedies, it speaks only of society as a collective unit. Clearly the Court is operating under different and inconsistent theories of fourth amendment rights and remedies.<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Doernberg has suggested that the reason for this incoherence is a failure on the part of the Court to appreciate that
the Fourth Amendment has a dual nature---it is intended &quot;both to protect the rights of individuals and to prevent the government from functioning as in a police state.&quot;<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup> This
latter &quot;collective right,&quot; he proposes, implicitly underlies the &quot;police regulation&quot; aspect of the exclusionary rule, and deserves recognition in the form of a broader conception of the right enshrined in the Fourth Amendment and, consequently, a more liberal approach to standing rules.
<p>
This article sets out to argue that the criticism that has been directed at American standing rules in search and seizure cases has important consequences for the development of the law in Canada. First, it will be argued that the course chosen by the U.S. Supreme Court in dealing with standing in search and seizure cases is inconsistent with Fourth Amendment principles---principles that also underlie the <cite>Charter's</cite> protections against unreasonable search and seizure. It will be suggested that the resulting confusion and incoherence of the American jurisprudence make it a poor model for Canadian courts to follow. Secondly, it will be argued that the structure of the right and remedy under the <cite>Charter</cite> differs in significant respects from the Fourth Amendment, so that even if a narrow standing regime were suitable in the United States it would nonetheless be inappropriate in the
Canadian context. Finally, the article will suggest that rejecting the American approach to standing in search and seizure cases and applying ideas similar to Doernberg's conception of Fourth Amendment rights to the <cite>Charter</cite> would have an additional benefit for Canadian law: as well as avoiding the confusion of the American  doctrine, such an approach to the right guaranteed by s. 8 would, it is suggested, make s. 8 more consistent with certain aspects of the exclusionary remedy provided by s. 24(2). Before proceeding with these arguments, however, it is necessary to review briefly the American doctrine on standing in search and seizure cases and to examine how it has been applied by Canadian courts in the context of the <cite>Charter</cite>.
<p>
<h3>U.S. Fourth Amendment &quot;Standing&quot; Doctrine<sup><href="#ten">10</a></sup></h3>

For a considerable period of time following the birth of the exclusionary rule<sup><a href="#eleven">11</a></sup> in the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court did not consider in detail the
question of who was entitled to invoke it. Lower federal courts did address the issue, however, holding that in order to establish a Fourth Amendment violation a claimant must have had some proprietary or related interest in the goods seized or the place searched.<sup><a href="#twelve">12</a></sup>
<p>
In <cite>Jones v. United States</cite><sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup> the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the narrow property-based standing doctrine developed in the courts below in favour of a broader rule. In this case, Jones had been charged with possession of narcotics following a search of a friend's apartment to which he had free access. He wished to challenge the constitutionality of the search warrant, claiming that it had been issued without probable cause having been shown. Since Jones was not the tenant of the apartment, the trial court and court of appeal had denied him standing to make this claim, based on the fact that he had no proprietary interest in the place searched. The alternative route to standing under the existing doctrine---establishing a proprietary interest in the goods seized---was also effectively closed to Jones, since if he admitted to owning the drugs, this admission could be used against him at trial even if the drugs themselves were excluded as evidence.
<p>
The Supreme Court disagreed with the courts below, and found two alternative grounds for granting standing to Jones. Stating that:
<blockquote>
It is unnecessary and ill-advised to import into the law surrounding the constitutional right to be free from
unreasonable searches and seizures subtle distinctions, developed and refined by the common law in evolving the body of private property law which, more than perhaps any other branch of law, has been shaped by distinctions whose validity is largely historical. . . <sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup>
</blockquote>
the Court rejected the idea that a proprietary interest in the place searched was required to bestow standing on an applicant. The majority instead declared that:
<blockquote>
[A]nyone legitimately on premises where a search occurs may challenge its legality by way of a motion to suppress,
when its fruits are proposed to be used against him.<sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Turning to the second ground Jones had raised, the Court pointed out that:
<blockquote>
[T]o hold that petitioner's failure to acknowledge interest in the narcotics . . . prevented his attack upon the search, would be to permit the Government to have the advantage of contradictory positions as a basis for conviction. Petitioner's conviction flows from his possession of the narcotics at the time of the search. Yet the fruits of that search, upon which the conviction depends, were admitted into evidence on the ground that petitioner did not have possession of the narcotics at that time. It is not consonant with the amenities, to put it mildly, of the administration
of criminal justice to sanction such squarely contradictory assertions of power by the Government.<sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup>
</blockquote>
To counter this problem, the Court held that people charged with possessory offences would be entitled to challenge the constitutionality of the search that led to the seizure of the objects they stood accused of possessing without having to prove that they were in fact in possession of the items,<sup><a href="#seventeen">17</a></sup> a rule which became known as the &quot;automatic standing rule.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup>
<p>
The Court moved Fourth Amendment doctrine even further away from a property-based approach in a subsequent case, <cite>Katz v. United States</cite>.<sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a></sup> The petitioner in <cite>Katz</cite> had made a number of telephone calls from a public telephone that, unbeknownst to him, was being monitored electronically by the police (who were acting without a warrant). The Court began by holding that electronic eavesdropping constituted a search under the Fourth Amendment. Declaring that &quot;the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places,&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty">20</a></sup> the Court went on to reject the government's characterization of the issue as being whether a telephone booth was a &quot;constitutionally protected area.&quot;  Rather, the Court stated that the purpose of the Fourth Amendment was the protection of citizens from government intrusion of their privacy rights, and that the relevant consideration was whether the victim of the search had an identifiable privacy interest. Harlan J., concurring, articulated a test that found favour in the cases that followed:
<blockquote>
[T]here is a twofold requirement, first that a person have exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy
and, second, that the expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as &quot;reasonable.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty1">21</a></sup>
</blockquote>
In <cite>Mancusi v. DeForte</cite><sup><a href="#twenty2">22</a></sup> the court applied its new privacy-based understanding of the Fourth Amendment to the issue of standing. DeForte, a Teamsters Union official, sought standing to challenge the search of the union headquarters and the seizure of certain papers. DeForte did not have a private office at the headquarters (he shared an office with other union officials) and did not have a proprietary interest in the materials seized, which belonged to the union. The Court granted him standing nevertheless, citing <cite>Jones</cite> and <cite>Katz</cite> and declaring that, while DeForte may not have had the legal power to exclude all others from the shared office, he nonetheless had &quot;a reasonable expectation of freedom from governmental intrusion.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty3">23</a></sup> 
<p>
In the 1969 decision in <cite>Alderman v. United States</cite>,<sup><a href="#twenty4">24</a></sup> the Court addressed the issue of whether someone could apply under the exclusionary rule for suppression of evidence obtained through a violation of a third party's privacy interests, a question that had been mentioned in passing but not firmly resolved in several of the earlier cases discussed above. The case involved a number of conspiracy charges, which had been brought after evidence against the alleged conspirators had been obtained by police wiretaps of one accused's house. The various accused were affected by the wiretaps in different ways: some of the alleged conspirators' own conversations had been recorded; another had not had his own conversations taped, but owned the house where the wiretaps were placed; and a third group was implicated in the taped conversations of the others although their own conversations had not been recorded. The Court held that the latter group did not have standing to challenge the admission of the evidence, stating that:
<blockquote>
[S]uppression of the product of a Fourth Amendment violation can be successfully urged only by those whose rights were violated by the search itself, not by those who are aggrieved solely by the introduction of damaging evidence.<sup><a href="#twenty5">25</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The Court went on to declare that &quot;Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights which, like some other constitutional rights, may not be vicariously asserted.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty6">26</a></sup> However,
the court continued by granting standing to the petitioner whose property had been implicated in the eavesdropping, holding that either privacy interests (under <cite>Katz</cite>) or proprietary interests (under the pre-<cite>Katz</cite> rule) were sufficient to confer standing on a claimant.<sup><a href="#twenty7">27</a></sup>
<p>
Fortas J. dissented on the first point, declaring that:
<blockquote>
The Fourth Amendment is not merely a privilege accorded to him whose domain has been lawlessly invaded. It grants the individual a personal right, not to privacy, but to insist that the state utilize only lawful means of proceeding against him.<sup><a href="#twenty8">28</a></sup>
</blockquote>
He went on to add that while <cite>Jones</cite> held that &quot;something more than the generalized interest of any citizen in governmental obedience to law&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty9">29</a></sup> was required to give a claimant standing, anyone &quot;against whom the search was directed&quot; was &quot;the victim of an invasion of privacy&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty">30</a></sup> within the meaning of the <cite>Jones</cite> test, even if it was not his or her possessions or surroundings that were searched. Being the target of the unconstitutional search, in his view, was
<blockquote>
enough to give [the target of the search] &quot;standing&quot; to object that the government agents conducted their
unlawful search and seizure to obtain evidence to use against him. The Government violates his rights when it seeks to deprive him of his liberty by unlawfully seizing evidence in the course of an investigation and using it against him at trial.<sup><a href="#thirty1">31</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The approach taken by Fortas J. (which became known as &quot;target standing&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty2">32</a></sup>) was explicitly rejected by the Court in the 1979 decision in <cite>Rakas v. Illinois</cite>,<sup><a href="#thirty3">33</a></sup> a case that initiated the Court's movement toward both a narrowed standing doctrine and a narrowed conception of privacy. In <cite>Rakas</cite>, a car carrying three men (one of whom was the car's owner) was unlawfully stopped and searched, and evidence was found that implicated the car's occupants in a robbery which had recently taken place. The two non-owners sought to have this evidence excluded, arguing first that they were targets of the search, and alternatively that they were &quot;legitimately on the premises&quot; of their friend's car, and thus entitled to standing by virtue of  <cite>Jones</cite>.<sup><a href="#thirty4">34</a></sup> Rehnquist J., writing for the Court, categorically rejected the &quot;target standing&quot; approach, declaring that:
<blockquote>
A person who is aggrieved by an illegal search and seizure only through the introduction of damaging evidence secured by a search of a third person's premises or property has not had any of his Fourth Amendment rights infringed.<sup><a href="#thirty5">35</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Turning to the second argument, Rehnquist J. overruled the &quot;legitimately on the premises&quot; test derived from <cite>Jones</cite>, while maintaining that <cite>Jones</cite> was correctly decided on its facts:
<blockquote>
We think that <cite>Jones</cite> on its facts merely stands for the unremarkable proposition that a person can have a legally sufficient interest in a place other than his own home so that the Fourth Amendment protects him from unreasonable government intrusion into that place.<sup><a href="#thirty6">36</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The sole correct approach, according to the Court, was whether the petitioner had a &quot;legitimate expectation of
privacy&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty7">37</a></sup> in the place searched. Whether or not the claimant was legitimately on the premises might be relevant to the question of whether or not he or she had a legitimate expectation of privacy, but it could not &quot;be deemed controlling.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty8">38</a></sup>
<p>
In rejecting the defendants' assertion that they had a legitimate expectation of privacy while in the car, the majority did not exhaustively state what considerations it believed would be relevant in applying the &quot;legitimate expectation of privacy&quot; test. Considerable attention was paid, however, to the fact that the defendants &quot;asserted neither a property nor a possessory interest in the automobile, nor an interest in the property seized.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty9">39</a></sup> To the four dissenters, led by White J., the true meaning of the majority's opinion was that: 
<blockquote>
The Court today holds that the Fourth Amendment protects property, not people, and specifically that a legitimate
occupant of an automobile may not invoke the exclusionary rule and challenge a search of that vehicle unless he happens to own or have a possessory interest in it.<sup><a href="#forty">40</a></sup>
</blockquote>
In the dissenters' view, this approach had &quot;no support in the Court's controlling decisions, or in common sense.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty1">41</a></sup>
<p>
Although the <cite>Rakas</cite> majority disputed the dissenters' contention that property rights had played a paramount role in its decision, the dissenters' claim that the majority was equating privacy with property gained some credibility in 1980 with the release of the Court's decision in <cite>Rawlings v. Kentucky</cite>.<sup><a href="#forty2">42</a></sup> The accused in this case had placed a quantity of drugs in his friend Cox's purse (with her consent) as they visited a friend's house. While they were there, the police arrived, intending to arrest one of the house's occupants who, as it turned out, was not home at the time. Once inside the house the police unlawfully detained all those present while a search warrant was sent for, telling them that they could only leave if they consented to be searched. Rawlings and Cox were thus detained illegally until the warrant arrived, at which point Cox's purse was searched and the drugs were found. Rawlings claimed them as his own, and at trial sought to have the evidence excluded. Rehnquist J., again writing for the Court, held that Rawlings did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in Cox's purse. He based his opinion on a number of factors, which included the fact that Rawlings had known Cox for only a week and the ground that he did not &quot;have any right to exclude other persons from access to Cox's purse.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty3">43</a></sup> As one commentator on
the decision has pointed out, this appears to reject the concept of  relative privacy from government intrusion contained in <cite>DeForte</cite> (as contrasted with the property-based concept of freedom from intrusion by the whole world):
<blockquote>
Though Rawlings may not have anticipated total privacy vis-&agrave;-vis Cox and her invitees, he may nonetheless have expected that the government would be excluded. But as <cite>Rakas</cite> . . . and <cite>Rawlings</cite> now make clear, expectation of freedom from governmental intrusion is not sufficient to bring the fourth amendment into play; the new doctrine of standing requires freedom from any intrusion.<sup><a href="#forty4">44</a></sup>
</blockquote>
In a further development, the majority also rejected Rawlings' contention that he had standing on the basis of his
admitted ownership of the drugs, a doctrine that, as noted earlier, pre-dated <cite>Jones</cite> and had been upheld in <cite>Alderman</cite>.<sup><a href="#forty5">45</a></sup> Finally, in <cite>United States v. Salvucci</cite>,<sup><a href="#forty6">46</a></sup> released the same day as <cite>Rawlings</cite>, the Court overturned the &quot;automatic standing&quot; rule of <cite>Jones</cite>, preventing Rawlings from claiming standing in that way.
<p>
 The state of affairs arrived at after <cite>Rawlings</cite> and <cite>Salvucci</cite> (which has not changed appreciably in the past thirteen years) can be summarized as follows: the U.S. Court has clearly rejected any concept of &quot;vicarious&quot; standing,<sup><a href="#forty7">47</a></sup> and has, moreover, rejected the idea that the Fourth Amendment contains a right to be secure against illegal government activity <i>per se</i>.<sup><a href="#forty8">48</a></sup> Instead, the Court's conception of the Fourth Amendment has collapsed into the question of whether there existed a &quot;legitimate expectation of privacy&quot;<sup><a href="#forty9">49</a></sup> ---an expectation of privacy both subjectively held and objectively reasonable. In determining whether a legitimate expectation of privacy exists, the Court now applies a very narrow understanding of privacy---one based heavily (although perhaps not exclusively) on concepts of private property, and one that recognizes no distinction between expectations of privacy <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the state and expectations <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the rest of the world.<sup><a href="#fifty">50</a></sup> At the same time, a property interest in the item seized is no longer sufficient by itself to grant standing to a petitioner---a separate expectation of privacy must be established.<sup><a href="#fifty1">51</a></sup>
<p>
While the above discussion includes only a fraction of the many twists, turns, and exceptions that have arisen during the &quot;tortured history&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty2">52</a></sup> of this area of Fourth Amendment law, it does serve to describe the American doctrine's chief salient features, the relevance and wisdom of which must be considered by Canadian courts as they attempt to draw from the American experience. The following section will
briefly outline the way in which Canadian courts have considered and adopted the American &quot;standing&quot; doctrine in their s. 8 jurisprudence. 
<p>
<h3>Section 8 of the <cite>Charter</cite></h3>

In its first major pronouncement on s. 8 interpretation, <cite>Hunter v. Southam</cite>,<sup><a href="#fifty3">53</a></sup> the Supreme Court of Canada stated clearly that privacy interests, not property interests, were the basis of the s. 8 right. Dickson J. (as he then was) referred approvingly to the U.S. Supreme Court's formulation of the Fourth Amendment right in <cite>Katz</cite>,<sup><a href="#fifty4">54</a></sup> noting that:
<blockquote>
[In <cite>Katz</cite>] Justice Stewart rejected any necessary connection between that Amendment and the notion of trespass. With respect, I believe this approach is equally appropriate in construing the protections in s. 8 of the <cite>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite>.<sup><a href="#fifty5">55</a></sup>
</blockquote>
He was careful, however, to leave open the possibility that s. 8 rights might extend beyond an interest in privacy:
<blockquote>
I would be wary of foreclosing the possibility that the right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure might protect interests beyond the right of privacy, but for purposes of the present appeal I am satisfied that its protections go at least that far.<sup><a href="#fifty6">56</a></sup>
</blockquote>
In subsequent decisions, the Supreme Court has made it clear that s. 8 protection extends to such violations of privacy as electronic eavesdropping.<sup><a href="#fifty7">57</a></sup> The Court has not yet specified in detail, however, the full nature and extent of the right to privacy, and has not elaborated on the idea that s. 8 may protect interests beyond privacy.
<p>
A number of early decisions by lower courts in Canada did not follow the narrow American interpretation of the &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy test,&quot; and instead construed the privacy rights referred to by the Supreme Court in <cite>Hunter v. Southam</cite> broadly.<sup><a href="#fifty8">58</a></sup> For example, in <cite>Re Church of Scientology and the Queen</cite><sup><a href="#fifty9">59</a></sup> the Ontario High Court held that individuals had a privacy interest in church records of &quot;counselling sessions&quot; which had been seized. The reason for this was that the individuals had expected the church would keep the information confidential, although the documents were church property rather than the property of the individuals. Borins J. of the Ontario District Court went somewhat further in <cite>R. v. Guiller</cite>,<sup><a href="#sixty">60</a></sup> a case involving an unlawful search of a third party's premises that led to the seizure of letters written by the accused. In granting the accused standing to challenge the search, the judge stated:
<blockquote>
It seems to me that a reasonable expectation of privacy contains the expectation that when a search of third party
premises is conducted, as a result of which evidence prejudicial to an accused is located and seized, the search will be conducted pursuant to constitutionally valid standards.<sup><a href="#sixty1">61</a></sup>
</blockquote>
This result was followed in <cite>R. v. Leonard</cite>,<sup><a href="#sixty2">62</a></sup> which involved
a situation similar to that encountered in <cite>Rawlings</cite> (a body search of the accused's travelling companion leading to the seizure of narcotics).
<p>
However, the validity of these decisions as precedents has been placed in doubt by several more recent decisions of the Alberta, Ontario, and British Columbia Courts of Appeal. In the 1987 decision in <cite>R. v. Leaney and  Rawlinson</cite><sup><a href="#sixty3">63</a></sup> the Alberta Court of Appeal denied Leaney standing to challenge searches of his co-accused Rawlinson's apartment, on the grounds that he did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched.<sup><a href="#sixty4">64</a></sup> The Court, however, merely stated its conclusion on this issue without giving detailed supporting reasons. A more exhaustive treatment was
provided by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <cite>R. v. Pugliese</cite>.<sup><a href="#sixty5">65</a></sup> In that case the Ontario Court referred extensively and approvingly to the U.S. Supreme Court's <cite>Rakas, Rawlings</cite>, and <cite>Salvucci</cite> decisions and rejected the appellant's claim that he had standing to challenge the seizure of cocaine from the apartment of one McInnis, who allegedly worked as a &quot;runner&quot; for the appellant's narcotics trafficking operation. Pugliese had argued both that he had an expectation of privacy in McInnis's apartment, and alternatively that he acquired standing from the fact that he was
the target of the search. The Court rejected both of these contentions. In discussing the privacy claim, Finlayson J.A. began by noting that &quot;the appellant . . . was in no position to refuse entry to McInnis's apartment to any person who had McInnis's permission to enter.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty6">66</a></sup> However, he then changed direction, declaring that &quot;this discussion about the appellant's legal or proprietary rights in the premises or
in the articles seized is beside the point,&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty7">67</a></sup> and that the real issue was whether there was a reasonable expectation of privacy. He continued by saying that there was no evidence on the record suggesting that the accused ever had such an expectation. To what extent the judgment should be read as an
acceptance of the narrow and largely property-based American approach to privacy is thus somewhat uncertain, although the number of apparently approving references to the above-mentioned U.S. cases is suggestive.
<p>
On the issue of &quot;target standing&quot; the Court was considerably less equivocal, rejecting it in no uncertain terms. &quot;The appellant's target theory,&quot; declared the Court, &quot;has never been accepted in this jurisdiction and has been specifically rejected in the United States.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty8">68</a></sup> Finlayson J.A. went on to declare that:
<blockquote>
A constitutional right to privacy is not created merely by reason of a person becoming the target of a search. An
accused person's right to challenge the legality of a search and seizure depends upon whether he has first discharged the burden of satisfying the court that <i>his</i> personal constitutional rights have been violated.<sup><a href="#sixty9">69</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The approach taken by the Ontario Court in <cite>Pugliese</cite> has been approved on several occasions by the British Columbia Court of Appeal.<sup><a href="#seventy">70</a></sup> In <cite>R. v. Arason and
Desrosier</cite><sup><a href="#seventy1">71</a></sup> the B.C. Court held that the appellants had no standing to challenge a warrantless perimeter search of a building leased by a third party which the appellants used to grow marijuana, on the grounds that the lessee was the building's sole &quot;occupant.&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy2">72</a></sup> Similarly, in <cite>R. v. Sandhu</cite><sup><a href="#seventy3">73</a></sup> the Court denied the accused standing to challenge the constitutionality of a warrantless search of a co-accused's bag. After discussing the Ontario Court's holding in <cite>Pugliese</cite>, Prowse J.A. declared:
<blockquote>
In this case, I conclude that Mr Sandhu does not have standing to challenge the admissibility of the evidence obtained in the search and seizure on December 27, 1990 at the airport. The onus was on him to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the bag and its contents. The evidence does not support that conclusion. Although the evidence does suggest that Mr Ahmed [the co-accused] had a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the bag and its contents, the authorities do not support the proposition that Mr Sandhu can rely on that fact to give him standing in these circumstances.<sup><a href="#seventy4">74</a></sup>
</blockquote>
These decisions raise a number of important issues which will be discussed below. To begin, the &quot;expectation of privacy&quot; standard will be examined, and problems associated with its implementation in the United States will be discussed. This, in turn, will lead into a discussion of the differences between the American exclusionary rule and s. 24(2) of the <cite>Charter</cite>---differences which, it will be argued, make the American standing doctrine unsuitable for adoption in Canada. Finally, the nature of the right and remedy in the <cite>Charter</cite> will be discussed, with reference to several American commentators who have criticized and offered alternatives to the current U.S. doctrine. It will be argued that a broad conception of the right enshrined in s. 8 (and, consequently, a liberal standing rule) is supported by the language and purpose of the <cite>Charter</cite>. Moreover, it will be suggested that such a broad understanding of s. 8 would further benefit the <cite>Charter</cite> by helping to relate s. 8 to the exclusionary rule, creating a theoretical basis for the full development of section 24(2).
<p>
<h3>Problems with the &quot;Expectation of Privacy&quot; Test</h3>

While the initial change from a &quot;property-based&quot; to a &quot;privacy-based&quot; rationale for Fourth Amendment rights in the United States was widely seen as having\break expanded those rights considerably,<sup><a href="#seventy5">75</a></sup> the &quot;privacy&quot; standard has proven vulnerable to subsequent re-narrowing by the courts. In the words of one commentator:
<blockquote>
The progression from <cite>Jones</cite> to <cite>Rawlings</cite> provides a painful lesson for those who support a broad view of the fourth amendment. The vague, all-encompassing test of <cite>Katz</cite>, with its dependence on questions of fact for deciding fourth amendment issues, has proved just as useful for restricting constitutional protections late in the 1970's as it was for expanding those protections a decade [earlier].<sup><a href="#seventy6">76</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The source of the problem is the fact that the term &quot;privacy,&quot; which is intended in both Fourth Amendment and <cite>Charter</cite> jurisprudence to delineate the extent of the constitutionally protected &quot;security&quot; interest, is only marginally less vague than the word &quot;security&quot; it stands in place of. As a consequence, the privacy standard carries with it the inherent danger that it will be applied in a conclusory way, and that analysis will in actuality be driven by the court's view of the advisability of the exclusionary remedy rather than by considerations of what truly constitutes a &quot;legitimate&quot; or &quot;reasonable&quot; expectation of privacy. There is ample evidence supporting the argument that distaste for the exclusionary rule was in fact the prime motivating force behind the Burger Court's narrowing of Fourth Amendment &quot;standing&quot; doctrine.<sup><a href="#seventy7">77</a></sup> In <cite>Rakas</cite>, Rehnquist J. commented disparagingly that:
<blockqutoe>
Each time the exclusionary rule is applied it exacts a substantial social cost for the vindication of Fourth
Amendment rights. Relevant and reliable evidence is kept from the trier of fact and the search for truth at trial is
deflected.<sup><a href="#seventy8">78</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Burger C.J., for his part, also attacked the exclusionary rule on a number of occasions.<sup><a href="#seventy9">79</a></sup> In view of this hostility toward the remedy, one can interpret the Court's reluctance to grant standing as being motivated by a desire to avoid applying the exclusionary rule rather
than by considerations flowing out of a well thought out theory of privacy.
<p>
The consequence of the Court's reliance on standing as a covert tool for attacking the exclusionary rule has been a body of jurisprudence that often turns on distinctions that appear irrelevant or even irrational when seen in terms of an ordinary, everyday understanding of privacy. For example, following the holding in <cite>Rakas</cite> that ordinary passengers in a car do not have standing to object to its search, lower courts on one occasion held that a
passenger in a taxi had an expectation of privacy (since he could &quot;determine its destination . . . [and] exclude others from it during his ride&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty">80</a></sup>), but on another occasion determined that a driver in sole possession of a rental car did not have such an expectation of privacy, on the grounds that he was in violation of the terms of the rental contract (which named his wife the sole driver) and thus had relinquished any legally enforceable possessory right in the car.<sup><a href="#eighty1">81</a></sup> It is difficult to relate
this type of casuistic distinction to any conventional understanding of privacy, and it is even more difficult to justify on policy grounds why this type of distinction <i>should</i> determine the constitutionality of a search. There is at least some value in having legal doctrine that is sensible and clear, and it is difficult to argue that the American standing doctrine has either of these qualities.
<p>
In addition to the above criticism of the inconsistent and peculiar outcomes of cases under the American doctrine, the Burger Court's jurisprudence on standing can be attacked by arguing that several of the central propositions introduced and relied on by the Court in reaching its conclusions are incorrect. One of the most troubling of these propositions is the contention (expressed initially in <cite>Rakas</cite> and reiterated in <cite>Rawlings</cite>) that an expectation of privacy from intrusion by the whole world is a necessary antecedent to an expectation of privacy from intrusion by government agents. Such a position runs completely counter to most people's experience---in countless situations in day-to-day life people reveal secrets or entrust items to others in implicit reliance that the items or information will not be turned over to the government, albeit with no legal recourse that would prevent the
recipient of the trust from violating it. It is rather perverse to declare that any such expectation of privacy is &quot;unreasonable&quot; simply because it is somewhat weaker than an expectation backed up by an enforceable private-law interest. The unsuccessful petitioners in <cite>Rakas</cite>, for instance, were accused of having committed an armed robbery in concert with the car's owner (and driver), and no doubt fully expected that the owner would not voluntarily provide evidence to the police that would incriminate them all---an expectation that
in hindsight appears to have been fully justified, since the owner in fact did not consent to the police search (and successfully argued that it violated his own constitutional rights). The petitioners' trust in the owner certainly appears &quot;reasonable&quot; in the usual sense of the word---the chances of it being broken were remote.
Nonetheless, the Court in essence held that the remote possibility that the owner <i>might</i> voluntarily reveal their joint secret (a chance that did <i>not</i> materialize) was sufficient to destroy the occupants' expectation of privacy entirely.
<p>
Such a limited understanding of &quot;privacy&quot; has very little connection with the ordinary person's conception of the term. As LaFave points out:
<blockquote>
[W]hile a &quot;right to exclude&quot; may be an easy way to establish the requisite legitimate expectation of privacy, it hardly follows that it is the <i>only way</i>; as the <cite>Rawlings</cite> dissenters note, &quot;such a harsh threshold requirement was not imposed even in the heyday of a property rights oriented Fourth Amendment.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty2">82</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Although the person who controls admission to premises or who is the bailee of goods may have the power to allow a police search against the will of the accused, the Court's approach leads to &quot;the incredible result that whenever police could conduct a lawful search with the bailee's [or owner of the premises's] consent, they may then proceed to make that search without the bailee's [or owner's] consent because the bailor will not have standing to
object.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty3">83</a></sup>
<p>
 A further difficulty with the U.S. Supreme Court's approach to standing arises from the fact that it fails to distinguish between two very different reasons that might underlie an absence of subjective expectation of freedom from government intrusion. A person might lack such a subjective expectation, for example, because he or she is carrying out some activity in a public place. Alternatively, the subjective expectation could be destroyed simply because the government has made it clear that the person's privacy interests are not going to be respected by the state (an &quot;Orwellian type of advance notice,&quot; in the words of one author).<sup><a href="#eighty4">84</a></sup> For instance, in <cite>Rawlings</cite> much was made by the Court of the fact that Rawlings admitted at trial that he expected Cox's purse would be searched by the police---the Court considered this indicative of his lack of subjective expectation that the purse would be free from governmental intrusion. However, as several commentators have pointed out,<sup><a href="#eighty5">85</a></sup> Rawlings may well have meant by his admission only that his subjective expectation that the purse would remain protected from government intrusion vanished once the police arrived at the house, illegally detained the occupants and their guests, and made it absolutely clear that everyone was going to be searched whether they consented or not. As LaFave points out:
<blockquote>
[I]f one can be deprived of Fourth Amendment standing by being informed in advance by the police of the intrusion
they intend to make, then it is certainly correct, as the <cite>Rawlings</cite> dissenters complained, that the majority &quot;has turned the development of the law of search and seizure on its head.&quot;  This would mean, for example, that Rawlings likewise had no standing with respect to his own person, which he also expected would be intruded on by the police, and that equally ridiculous results would obtain in an infinite variety of search cases.<sup><a href="#eighty6">86</a></sup>
</blockquote>
As noted earlier, several provincial Courts of Appeal have adopted the constricted view of privacy articulated by the U.S. Supreme Court. In a few decisions, moreover, these courts have relied on property-based considerations reminiscent of those found in <cite>Rakas</cite>.<sup><a href="#eighty7">87</a></sup> In light of the above
criticisms of the American standing doctrine, it can be argued that this wholesale incorporation of flawed U.S. jurisprudence into Canadian law should be rejected by the Supreme Court of Canada. There are additional arguments that can be made in support of an alternative approach to the question of standing in search and seizure cases. Before discussing these arguments, however, it is necessary to outline the Canadian and American rules governing the exclusion of illegally obtained evidence.
<p>
<h3>The Canadian and American Exclusionary Rules</h3>

Although the rights guaranteed in s. 8 of the <cite>Charter</cite> are similar in many respects to those protected by the Fourth Amendment, the two constitutional provisions are not identical. As Dickson J. warned in <cite>Hunter</cite>, because of the differences &quot;American decisions can be transplanted into the Canadian context only with the greatest of caution.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty8">88</a></sup>
<p>
 An even greater barrier to the importation of American doctrine into Canadian law is presented, however, by the very different remedial structures of the two constitutions. Unlike the <cite>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite>, the Constitution of the United States contains no express remedial provision analogous to
either s. 52 or s. 24. In particular, the American exclusionary rule emerged as a &quot;judge-made&quot; remedy to Fourth Amendment violations and, as such, does not contain internal qualifiers to its application such as those found in s. 24(2) of the <cite>Charter</cite>.
<p>
EVOLUTION OF THE AMERICAN EXCLUSIONARY RULE<sup><a href="#eighty9">89</a></sup>
<p>
At its inception<sup><a href="#ninety">90</a></sup> and for many years thereafter, the exclusionary rule in the United States was held to be available to any petitioner who had standing and who had demonstrated a Fourth Amendment violation.<sup><a href="#ninety1">91</a></sup> Courts applying the rule did not engage in any further balancing, or consider alternative remedies. Initially, the rule was seen as having several purposes,<sup><a href="#ninety2">92</a></sup> including deterring unconstitutional state interference with individual rights, remedying the wrong done to the individual<sup><a href="#ninety3">93</a></sup> and upholding the integrity of the courts by preventing them from appearing to condone police wrongdoing.<sup><a href="#ninety4">94</a></sup> Over the subsequent years of the rule's development, however, &quot;the individual remedy and judicial integrity concerns tended to vanish from exclusionary rule jurisprudence altogether.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety5">95</a></sup> By the Burger Court's day, the rule was characterized solely as a means of deterring police misconduct.<sup><a href="#ninety6">96</a></sup> This emphasis on the deterrence rationale led the Court to adopt a &quot;good faith&quot; exception to the rule in cases where police had relied on a faulty warrant, since, it was argued, &quot;good faith&quot; errors by police officers could not be deterred, and the rule would not serve to check the actions of judges who issued faulty warrants.<sup><a href="#ninety7">97</a></sup> Subject to this exception, however, the rule can still be invoked at the behest of the accused who crosses the &quot;threshold&quot; barriers---no other &quot;internal balancing&quot; is involved, and the court cannot substitute another remedy (since the Supreme Court, despite its frequent criticism of the exclusionary rule, has never developed any alternative remedies for a Fourth Amendment violation).
<p>
EXCLUSION OF EVIDENCE IN CANADA UNDER S. 24(2)
<p>
In contrast to the American Bill of Rights, the <cite>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite> contains an explicit remedial provision, which includes an express direction that &quot;all the circumstances&quot; must be considered before illegally obtained evidence is excluded. Section 24 declares:
<blockquote>
24. (1) Anyone whose rights or freedoms, as guaranteed by this Charter, have been infringed or denied may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances.
<p>
(2) Where, in proceedings under subsection (1), a court concludes that evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed by this Charter, the evidence shall be excluded if it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
</blockquote>
While s. 24(2) on the one hand eliminates some of the remedial discretion found in s. 24(1) in cases involving
unconstitutionally obtained evidence by instructing judges that they &quot;shall&quot; exclude the evidence if the second part of the test is met, it also orders courts to undertake an analysis of whether, under all the circumstances, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence were admitted. The Supreme Court
considered the content of this second, rather imprecise instruction in <cite>Collins v. The Queen</cite>,<sup><a href="#ninety8">98</a></sup> and described the relevant factors that must be considered.<sup><a href="#ninety9">99</a></sup>
<p>
The presence of internal &quot;balancing&quot; in s. 24(2) has important consequences when the applicability of the American standing rules to the <cite>Charter</cite> is considered. As noted in the preceding section, the U.S. Supreme Court's reluctance to grant standing appears to have been motivated largely by that Court's opinion that the exclusionary remedy had excessive social costs. It was also suggested that in attempting to rein in the exclusionary
rule by restricting the right, the Court lessened both the self-consistency of the doctrine and its connection with common sense. Even if one takes a kinder view of the Court's actions and does not accept this last claim, it can still be maintained that American-style covert curbing of the exclusionary rule is unnecessary in Canada, where the internal limitations of s. 24(2) allow the balancing of social costs to be done openly and directly. As a rule, Canadian courts have taken the position that the existence of a balancing provision in s. 1 implies that the rights guaranteed under the rest of the <cite>Charter</cite> should be broadly interpreted. Similar considerations apply to s. 24(2)---using arcane standing requirements to limit the use of the exclusionary rule is inadvisable, considering that a better tool for reaching the same result has been included in the <cite>Charter</cite> itself.
<p>
<h3>Target Standing<sup><a href="#onehundred">100</a></sup></h3>

As noted earlier, in many third-party search cases both a broadly interpreted but strictly privacy-based approach to standing and an approach that incorporates some variant of &quot;target standing&quot; produce the same results---as the facts of the cases discussed in the previous sections reveal, more often than not the two issues overlap.<sup><a href="#one01">101</a></sup> As argued above, however, the purely privacy-based approach suffers from a number of drawbacks---the vagueness and flexibility of the &quot;privacy&quot; concept lessens its use as a guide, leaving the doctrine open to manipulation and the danger that rules will be adopted that are based on irrational distinctions, serve no justifiable policy goal, and needlessly complicate and confuse the law. Restricting
s. 8 to privacy rights can also be criticized on a more fundamental level as being under-inclusive, ignoring other interests that s. 8 should protect. Although these other interests can often be protected by a liberal interpretation of privacy, it can still be argued that in some cases channelling the analysis through the concept of privacy obscures the underlying purposes of s. 8 and complicates its interaction with s. 24.
<p>
Courts that have denied applicants standing to challenge third-party searches<sup><a href="#one02">102</a></sup> have tended to argue that the effect of granting standing would be to allow someone to claim a remedy for the violation of someone else's rights without having suffered a violation of his or her own personal rights. It is indeed the case that s. 24(1) (and, by extension, s. 24(2)<sup><a href="#one03">103</a></sup>) provides remedies only to applicants whose own <cite>Charter</cite> rights have been infringed<sup><a href="#one04">104</a></sup> ---a fact that has been used to deny petitioners standing to object to third-party searches on the grounds that they were attempting to claim a remedy for the rights violation of another. This argument presupposes, however, that the applicant's own rights have not been violated by the search in question, a conclusion usually reached on the basis that the applicant had no privacy interest or proprietary right that was infringed. While it is true that s. 24 cannot be invoked in a truly vicarious manner, characterizing the issue in these cases in this way simply assumes the conclusion---it ignores the possibility that s. 8 might extend beyond the realm of privacy and property and guarantee that an individual be secure from the effects of any governmental
action in violation of the Constitution. If s. 8 were understood in this way, people who are the targets of unreasonable searches of a third party's property or person would be able in some circumstances to claim that their own constitutional rights had been infringed, and that standing to challenge the search flows from this violation.
<p>
Arguments along these lines have been made by several American commentators<sup><a href="#one05">105</a></sup> in reference to the rights protected by the Fourth Amendment. Doernberg, in particular, has suggested that the Fourth Amendment has two aspects---an &quot;individualist&quot; element that protects privacy interests and a &quot;collective&quot; component that protects the right of society as a whole to be free from illegal governmental action. Drawing on the language of the Fourth Amendment, he writes:
<blockquote>
The two phrases, &quot;the right of the people,&quot; and &quot;to be secure,&quot; should guide those seeking fully to understand the fourth amendment. They imply that the amendment is a broad limitation on government; freedom from unreasonable searches is a constitutionally mandated social state.<sup><a href="#one06">106</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Moreover, he argues, the fact that the current American doctrine interprets the right in a narrowly individualized manner yet considers the exclusionary remedy's only goal to be police deterrence has resulted in &quot;lines of analysis irreconcilable with each other because they lack a consistent, articulable theoretical basis.&quot;<sup><a href="#one07">107</a></sup>
<p>
This echoes the view expressed by Fortas J. in his dissent in <cite>Alderman</cite>, where he wrote:
<blockquote>
The Fourth Amendment is not merely a privilege accorded to him whose domain has been lawlessly invaded. It grants the individual a personal right, not to privacy, but to insist that the state utilize only lawful means of proceeding against him. And it is an assurance that the government will exercise its formidable powers to arrest and to investigate only subject to the rule of law.<sup><a href="#one08">108</a></sup>
</blockquote>
To what extent can a similar argument be made about the <cite>Charter</cite>?  To be sure, the situation in the United States differs in several very important respects from that in Canada. It is often said that American legal and political thought has traditionally been characterized by a greater suspicion of government and a stronger belief in the value of unfettered individual liberty than has been found in this country.<sup><a href="#one09">109</a></sup> To the extent that the original intent of the two nations' constitutions is relevant to their interpretation, it is probably fair to say that the Framers of the Bill of Rights are likely to have placed a greater emphasis on controlling state actions than their more recent Canadian counterparts. Moreover, since Canadian jurisprudence on the exclusionary remedy has largely rejected the American view that it is solely a method of police control, Doernberg's arguments relating to the intellectual coherence of right and remedy may carry less weight
when applied north of the border.
<p>
 Despite these differences, an analysis similar to Doernberg's is supportable in the Canadian context---one which
suggests that s. 8 should be recognized as including a more generalized protection against unconstitutional state searches and seizures that goes beyond a narrow conception of individual privacy. The argument has several strands---textual, purposive, and policy-based---each of which will be discussed in turn.
<P>
THE LANGUAGE OF SECTION 8
<p>
Section 8 of the <cite>Charter</cite> reads, in English and French, as follows:
<blockquote>
8. Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure.<br>
8. Chacun a droit &agrave; la protection contre les fouilles, les perquisitions ou les saisies abusives.
</blockquote>
The &quot;right to be secure&quot; is not identical to a right to privacy: although &quot;security&quot; in this context undoubtedly includes some aspect of privacy, the concept of security may well extend further. As noted earlier, this possibility was specifically pointed out and left open by the Supreme Court in <cite>Hunter v. Southam</cite>.<sup><a href="#one10">110</a></sup> As Lamer J. (as he then was) noted in the <cite>B.C. Motor Vehicles Reference</cite>,<sup><a href="#one11">111</a></sup> the security rights contained in s. 8 are specific examples of the right to liberty and security of the person enshrined in s. 7. It is significant, therefore, that in the s. 7 context the right to security of the person has been held to have aspects other than those strictly related to privacy.<sup><a href="#one12">112</a></sup> In particular, it can be argued that a criminal conviction and consequent loss of liberty pose a threat to one's security. If that conviction is brought about by means of evidence obtained through an unreasonable search, it is arguable that one's security interests are infringed in a manner captured by s. 8.
<p>
Further guidance regarding the meaning of s. 8 can be found by examining the choice of words in the French-language version of the section, and, in particular, the choice of the word <i>abusif</i> to qualify the power to search. According to the French language dictionary <cite>Micro Robert</cite>, the word <i>abusif</i> and the
related term <i>abus</i> are defined as follows: 
<blockquote>
<i>abusif:</i> qui constitue un abus.<br>
<i>abus:</i> usage excessif ou unjuste.
</blockquote>
The meaning of <i>abusif</i> is thus closer to that of the English `abusive' than to `unreasonable' (which is better
approximated in French by <i>d&eacute;raisonnable</i>). The deliberate choice of this wording therefore suggests a recognition by the drafters of s. 8 that the underlying purpose of the right was the prevention of abuses of state power. An unconstitutional police search of one person intended to side-step constitutional limitations and incriminate a third party could well be the sort of abusive action the drafters had in mind.
<p>
PURPOSIVE APPROACH
<p>
As Dickson J. (as he then was) noted in <cite>Hunter v. Southam</cite>, &quot;The <cite>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite> is a purposive document,&quot;<sup><a href="#one13">113</a></sup> and must be interpreted with the underlying purposes in mind. In considering the question of standing, it is necessary to consider the purpose both of the right guaranteed in s. 8 and of the exclusionary remedy provided in s. 24. If, as suggested above, one purpose of either the right or the remedy is to protect against or control government abuses of a more general nature than immediate invasions of individual privacy, a narrow standing rule would run counter to this purpose and would not be consonant with the governing interpretive principle of the <cite>Charter</cite>. Consequently, it is necessary to examine and consider the aim of each section. 
<p>
<i>Section 8</i><br>
It was argued in the previous section that the language of s. 8 suggests that its purpose includes a generalized protection of individuals from abusive governmental searches that extends beyond the concept of privacy (although, as pointed out previously, the two concepts often overlap in a given case). This interpretation, however, flows not only from the words of the section, but can be inferred from the underlying principles of the <cite>Charter</cite> as a whole.
<p>
Why do we as a society prohibit unreasonable searches and seizures?  We do so not because the detrimental impact of such a search on the affected individuals in every instance outweighs the immediate societal benefits the search would bring---this is clearly not the case. Rather, we do so because as a society we reject such a narrow utilitarian calculus---our socio-political system is founded on the belief that individuals should not be sacrificed at will in the name of the common good. While our faith in this position is very largely due to conceptions of natural rights and justice, it also has what could be described as a broad utilitarian basis---a conviction that in the long run a commitment to individual autonomy will provide a better life for us all, and a belief that any short-term gains that
violations of this principle might seem to produce would prove in the end to be illusory. 
<p>
At the same time, we are forced to recognize that letting individual liberty run absolutely unchecked would lead to chaos, and to admit that some social controls are necessary. We fear the consequences of uncontrolled state power, however, and consequently insist that strict and clearly marked limits must be imposed on what the state can do. These limits are exemplified by the <cite>Charter</cite>---a document that delineates boundaries that (at least in principle) the state is only entitled to cross when to do so is absolutely necessary (&quot;demonstrably justified,&quot; in the language of s. 1). Yet the <cite>Charter</cite> also serves a more subtle function that goes beyond simple regulation. As a collection and articulation of our basic principles, it acts as a means by which we as a society remind ourselves of our values---tolerance, liberty, and respect for others---and provides us with a vision of who we like to think we are, reproaching us when we fail to live up to our own ideals.
<p>
This suggests that third-party searches cause harm in two ways. There is harm not only to the individual who is directly affected; in addition, our vision of ourselves as a society is damaged by the fact that the state, the agent of our collective will, has treated an individual as a mere object without rights. While this harms society as a whole, it injures in particular that individual who was the target of the state's abuse of its powers, who bears the brunt of the consequences of the state's wrongful act. While in some cases we may be willing to accept that such acts are necessary or justified, the <cite>Charter</cite> tells us that such justification is to be accomplished under s. 1 or s. 24(2) before the court---the agent of our collective conscience---in order both to control such abuses of individual rights by bringing them into the open, and to ensure that we recognize that even if in the end society considers the infringements justified, a line has been crossed, and our principles have been disturbed.
<p>
Adopting a narrow standing rule fails to recognize the full extent of the harm that a third-party search causes. By limiting the conception of the s. 8 right to encompass only the first individual in the chain of those affected by an unreasonable search, both the social harm and the harm to other individuals are ignored. Such an approach disregards a crucial element of the reason we think unreasonable searches are wrong and merit constitutional protection in the first place.
<p>
In addition, since the courts, as guardians of our rights, rely on interested parties to bring wrongful acts of the state to their notice, there is the pragmatic problem that a narrow standing rule prevents the courts from considering incidents of government malfeasance or carelessness that harms individuals and should properly be placed before them. Relying on the most immediately aggrieved party to always bring suit is unrealistic---in some situations he or she will not necessarily be the person with the greatest interest in pursuing the claim and will not press it to its  fullest. In the context of constitutional challenges to legislation, the Supreme Court of Canada has recognized the pitfalls of excessively narrow standing rules and has allowed persons who were not necessarily the most directly affected by the impugned legislation to bring suits attacking its validity if there appeared to be no other way the issue would be brought before the court.<sup><a href="#one14">114</a></sup> Similar considerations should arguably apply when what is attacked is state action rather than state legislation, such as cases where the actual target of an unreasonable search and seizure is a third party.
<p>
While the Supreme Court has remained carefully noncommittal on the question of third-party standing in search and seizure cases in most of its judgments to date, there are a few signs indicating that it accepts the principles underlying a broad standing rule. In <cite>R. v. Thompson</cite>,<sup><a href="#one15">115</a></sup> the Court gave what may prove to be an important signal of its intentions in this regard. The case involved a wiretap authorization which allowed the police to tap telephones both at the appellants' residence and at any other place they might &quot;resort to.&quot;  The police used this authorization to eavesdrop on several public pay telephones that were often used by the appellants but were also used by other members of the public. The police had reasonable grounds to suspect the appellants of wrongdoing, and were thus legitimately authorized to intrude on the appellants' privacy interests. Nonetheless, the appellants argued that the failure of the authorizing judge to limit the intrusion on
third-party users of the pay phones rendered the search unreasonable, an argument which was rejected by the B.C. Court of Appeal on the grounds that the appellants lacked standing to raise allegations of violations of third-party privacy rights.
<p>
The Supreme Court, however, accepted the argument and held not only that the appellants had standing, but determined in addition that s. 8 had been violated. Sopinka J., writing for the Court, stated:
<blockquote>
In my view, the extent of invasion into the privacy of these third parties is constitutionally relevant to the issue of
whether there has been an &quot;unreasonable&quot; search and seizure. To hold otherwise would be to ignore the purpose of s. 8 of the Charter which is to restrain invasion of privacy to within reasonable limits. A potentially massive invasion of privacy cannot be ignored simply because it is not brought to the attention of the court by one of these persons. Since these persons are unlikely to know of the invasion of their privacy, such invasions would escape scrutiny, and s. 8 would not fulfill its purpose.<sup><a href="#one16">116</a></sup>
</blockquote>
By recognizing that the purpose of s. 8 is the restraint of invasion of privacy in general, rather than simply the invasion of privacy of the individual bringing the claim, the Court appears to have acknowledged the existence of a broader generalized intent of s. 8 to regulate government action. In addition, the Court seems to accept the position that third parties who bear the brunt of unreasonable government actions are best suited to bring these actions to the Court's attention, even though their privacy interests may not be directly affected.
<p>
The issue confronted by the Court in <cite>Thompson</cite> is somewhat different from the typical third-party standing cases considered earlier, in that the appellants' own privacy interests had clearly been infringed.<sup><a href="#one17">117</a></sup> However, the infringement of <i>their</i> privacy interests was reasonable, and consequently did not violate the <cite>Charter</cite>---rather, the s. 8 infringement arose from the violation of the privacy of the third parties. If the violation of third-party privacy interests is the key to the constitutionality of the search, it is illogical to base the determination of standing on whether or not the appellants' own privacy interests have been infringed, since once standing is granted this factor becomes irrelevant to the determination of the issue. It thus can be argued that the logic of <cite>Thompson</cite> dictates that the targets of unreasonable searches be entitled to raise the issue of unreasonableness without proving that a violation of their personal privacy interest took place.
<p>
Further support for this position can be drawn from the Supreme Court's decision in <cite>R. v. Big M Drug Mart
Ltd.</cite><sup><a href="#one18">118</a></sup> In that case, the Court held that anyone charged with a criminal offence had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the law under which they were charged even if their own rights had not been violated.<sup><a href="#one19">119</a></sup> In this way, the Court recognized that s. 52 of the <cite>Charter</cite> gives the judiciary a broad mandate to regulate the actions of the legislature. Although s. 52 deals only with the constitutionality of legislation and not with the constitutionality of non-legislative state action, the same regulatory function would seem equally appropriate in circumstances involving unconstitutional state actions carried out in the absence of or contrary to legislation. State action not authorized by law is even more likely to be abusive and in violation of constitutional norms than action that has at least passed the scrutiny of Parliament---a fact recognized by s. 1, which states that an infringement of a protected right or liberty can only be
justified if it is &quot;prescribed by law.&quot;  According to <cite>Big M</cite>, the courts have a mandate to regulate unconstitutional legislation without having their hands tied by narrow standing rules. It would be inconsistent with this approach and with the principle of the supremacy of the <cite>Charter</cite> to turn around and impose narrow and restrictive standing rules when what is impugned is the state's acts rather than its laws.
<p>
A comparison of the <cite>Big M</cite> standing rule to the equivalent American doctrine is revealing. In contrast to the <cite>Big M</cite> approach, courts in the United States have held that as a general rule applicants must demonstrate a violation of their own constitutional rights before they can claim standing to challenge the constitutionality of legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court has stated that:
<blockquote>
Embedded in the traditional rules governing constitutional adjudication is the principle that a person to whom a
statute may constitutionally be applied will not be heard to challenge that statute on the ground that it may conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others, in other situations not before the Court. . . . [This principle reflects] the conviction that under our constitutional system courts are not roving commissions assigned to pass judgment on the validity of the nation's laws.<sup><a href="#one20">120</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The fact that the Supreme Court of Canada has not followed the American route and has instead taken the opposite course suggests that there is a general difference between the American and Canadian systems with respect to all issues of standing relating to constitutional challenges.<sup><a href="#one21">121</a></sup> If this is the case,
there is no reason why Canadian judges should blindly follow the American standing rules on issues such as third-party searches that involve state action---on the contrary, a different approach may in fact be more in keeping with our basic constitutional principles.
<p>
In <cite>R. v. Montoute</cite><sup><a href="#one22">122</a></sup> the Alberta Court of Appeal took what may be a step toward the introduction of a broad third-party standing rule in Canadian law. During the course of the investigation of an alleged conspiracy to traffic in narcotics, a wiretap was placed without prior judicial  authorization on the telephone of one of the accused's co-conspirators. The issue the court faced was whether the accused (who was not a party to the conversations that were recorded) had standing to challenge the admissibility of these taped conversations at his trial (if there was no s. 8 violation, the evidence would be admissible under the conspiratorial exception to the hearsay rule<sup><a href="#one23">123</a></sup>). Harradence J.A., writing for the majority on this point, declared that:
<blockquote>
An interpretation of the Charter that precludes an accused . . . from moving under s. 24(2) to exclude that evidence would not be in keeping with the approach laid down by Dickson C.J.C. in <cite>Hunter v. Southam</cite>.<sup><a href="#one24">124</a></sup>
</blockquote>
He continued by commenting that:
<blockquote>
If a co-conspirator's Charter rights have been breached in obtaining his declaration furthering the conspiratorial objectives to the extent that its admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute, it would drag the
administration of justice even further and deeper into the mire of disrepute to give &quot;judicial condonation to unacceptable conduct by investigatory agencies&quot; by the admission of that evidence on the pretext that s. 24(2) was not available to a co-conspirator as his Charter rights had not been breached. This would be a classic example of relying on a legal fiction [the conspiratorial exception to the hearsay rule] to incriminate an accused and then resorting to the &quot;austerity of tabulated legalism&quot; to deny a Charter remedy. . . . To deny a co-conspirator a Charter remedy [in this instance] would be &quot;the use of the sword without the scales&quot; and a clear example of the use of &quot;brute force&quot; to obtain a conviction.<sup><a href="#one25">125</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Many of Harradence J.A.'s comments regarding the repute of the administration of justice can be interpreted as being equally applicable in cases involving the seizure of real evidence from a third party, and it may well be that the Court intended them to be interpreted in this way. While it is also possible to read the opinion as only intending that standing be given to the targets of third-party searches in cases where the Crown attempts to take advantage of the so-called &quot;legal fiction&quot; of the conspiratorial hearsay rule exception,<sup><a href="#one26">126</a></sup> it is hard to see why this latter factor should play such an important role in deciding the issue. The former interpretation thus appears to be the more plausible one, at least from the point of view of
principle.<sup><a href="#one27">127</a></sup>
<p>
Section 24(2)<br>
Some further support for the argument that the <cite>Charter</cite> protects individuals from wrongful government actions that effect security interests beyond an immediate privacy interest can be found in the terms of the remedy provided by s. 24(2). The key provisions of s. 24(2) are the declarations that unconstitutionally obtained evidence <i>shall</i> be excluded <i>if</i> the admission of it could<sup><a href="#one28">128</a></sup> bring the
administration of justice into disrepute. As the Supreme Court has pointed out time and again, in its view the intent of s. 24(2) is not to provide automatic exclusion of all unconstitutionally obtained evidence, and its central purpose is not to deter police wrongdoing. Nonetheless, it has become clear that the behaviour of the police can be highly relevant to the question of whether admission of evidence would harm the reputation of the administration of justice. If the violation of the individual right is &quot;flagrant and serious&quot; or if the conduct of the police indicates a wilful disregard of the <cite>Charter</cite>, the Court has declared<sup><a href="#one29">129</a></sup> that the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the court &quot;did not exclude [the] evidence and dissociate itself from the conduct of the police.&quot;<sup><a href="#one30">130</a></sup>
<p>
This position was reiterated by Dickson C.J.C. in <cite>R. v. Genest</cite>,<sup><a href="#one31">131</a></sup> a case in which the police had searched a house with excessive force under the guise of a clearly defective warrant (described by the Chief Justice as &quot;a fishing licence, not a search warrant&quot;<sup><a href="#one32">132</a></sup>). He declared:
<blockquote>
While the purpose of s. 24(2) is not to deter police misconduct, the courts should be reluctant to admit evidence that
shows the signs of being obtained by an abuse of common law and Charter rights by the police.<sup><a href="#one33">133</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Similarly, in <cite>R. v. Duguay</cite><sup><a href="#one34">134</a></sup> a six-to-one majority of the Court approved<sup><a href="#one35">135</a></sup> of the principles enunciated in the Ontario Court of Appeal by
MacKinnon A.C.J.O., who had declared:
<blockquote>
If the court should turn a blind eye to [police misconduct], then the police may assume that they have the court's
tacit approval of it. I do not view the exclusion of evidence as a punishment of the police for their conduct, although it is to be hoped that it will act as a future deterrent. It is rather an affirmation of fundamental values in our society, and the only means [in the case at hand] of ensuring that the individual's Charter rights are not illusory.<sup><a href="#one36">136</a></sup>
</blockquote>
In short, s. 24(2) has several functions, one of which is to allow the courts to denounce and disapprove of unconscionable police behaviour by refusing to be a party to the admission of evidence obtained in blatant disregard of <cite>Charter</cite> values. This principle, however, is just as applicable to cases where the evidence is being used against someone other than the person searched as it is to cases where the immediate victim of the search and the accused are one and the same individual. In both cases, the admission of the evidence could be seen as a condonation by the courts of flagrantly unconstitutional and illegal government acts, and the administration of justice could as a consequence be brought into disrepute. A narrow standing rule, however, prevents the courts
from even beginning to examine the issue of police conduct in all third-party search cases, since such a rule ensures that the accused will never be allowed to bring the matter to the attention of the court. Thus, a narrow standing rule would effectively thwart one of the underlying purposes of s. 24(2), while a broader rule that does not eliminate claimants at such an early stage of the proceedings would allow the merits of their claims to be fully examined. The
latter approach, therefore, seems more consonant with s. 24(2) which, after all, states that courts are to examine &quot;all the circumstances&quot; relating to an unconstitutional search.
<p>
DETERRENCE AND SECTION 24(2)
<p>
Underlying the issue of standing is the more fundamental and even more difficult question of the merits and rationales of the exclusionary rule. As mentioned earlier, in the United States the narrowing of Fourth Amendment standing rules can be seen as an attempt by the Supreme Court to curb what it considers the exclusionary rule's excesses. At the same time, the rule itself is justified by the Court entirely in terms of its deterrent effect on police misconduct. As Doernberg points out, this incoherence between right and remedy has produced an inconsistent and at times nonsensical body of jurisprudence.
<p>
In Canada, a different approach has been taken to the remedial side of search and seizure law---the application of the exclusionary remedy has been limited, and its purpose has largely been characterized as the protection of the integrity of the justice system rather than the deterrence of future police wrongdoing. In light of this aspect of Canadian constitutional structure the narrow U.S. standing rules appear to be unnecessary and inconsistent with
the purposes of the <cite>Charter</cite>. In addition, the more expansive conception of the right protected by s. 8 that goes hand-in-hand with a broad approach to standing would have an additional (and arguably beneficial) effect: it will provide a theoretical basis and rationale for the incorporation of some deterrence considerations into the s. 24(2) remedy---considerations that, it is suggested, have been unduly ignored.
<p>
Canadian search and seizure law suffers from an ailment that is in some respects the converse of the one Doernberg diagnoses as afflicting Fourth Amendment doctrine in the United States. In the U.S., the inconsistency between the narrowly individualistic right and the strictly deterrent-based remedy has created incoherence as the right has been cut down further and further by the Court's attempt to avoid the consequences of the remedy. In Canada, on the other hand, courts have at least to some extent recognized the broader dimensions of the right, but have not incorporated all its implications into the remedy, by ignoring or rejecting out of hand the concept of deterrence of police misconduct as one of the rationales underlying s. 24(2).
<p>
The recognition that there is a societal interest in the government behaving lawfully that underlies a broad approach to the standing question also supports a deterrent rationale for the exclusionary rule by clarifying the harm to society caused by illegal searches and seizures. If the right is seen purely in terms of individual privacy interests, using the exclusionary rule as a deterrent is difficult to justify, since the deterrent effect is unlikely to benefit that particular accused in the future.<sup><a href="#one37">137</a></sup> If, on the other hand, the right is seen as having as a component a more general interest in government lawfulness, deterrence makes more sense---society as a whole, which has suffered as a consequence of official wrongdoing, benefits if patterns of wrongdoing are eliminated.
<p>
Moreover, by focusing attention on the effects a rights violation has on society's interest in the rule of law, this approach emphasizes the true meaning and extent of the term &quot;administration of justice&quot; in s. 24(2). The repute of the administration of justice is a function not only of societal opinion of the courts as institutions; it depends in addition on how society views the police, the prisons, and all the other constituent parts that
together make up the justice system. In considering the repute of the administration of justice in s. 24(2) analysis, Canadian courts have tended to focus their attention almost exclusively on the repute of the judiciary, ignoring the fact that there are other equally important aspects to the reputation of the justice system as a whole.<sup><a href="#one38">138</a></sup> While courts have recognized that judicial condonation of police misconduct will harm the system's repute, they have failed to acknowledge overtly the fact that widespread police misconduct <i>itself</i> lowers the public's perception of the administration of justice. 
<p>
It can be argued that deterrence considerations have in practice played a larger role in courts' s. 24(2) decisions than
they have been willing to admit. The fact that the remedy in s. 24(2) is the exclusion of evidence in itself provides some indication of this---if denunciation of police wrongdoing were all that was required, courts could in at least some cases rely solely on declarations that the police had misbehaved, a remedy that courts in other contexts have considered to be a sufficient spur to correct constitutional violations.<sup><a href="#one39">139</a></sup> The
exclusionary rule, in contrast, recognizes the underlying incentives that the police have to cut corners and infringe rights, and realizes that to eliminate or at least control these excesses a remedy with some teeth is required. Canadian courts have acknowledged that the exclusionary rule has deterrent effects, but have tended to treat these effects as simply incidental to the denunciatory function.<sup><a href="#one40">140</a></sup> This less-than-complete understanding of the nature of the remedy has arguably hampered the clarity and coherence of judicial analysis.
<p>
The deterrent effect of the exclusion of evidence on police misconduct has been attacked by some, most notably former U.S. Chief Justice Burger,<sup><a href="#one41">141</a></sup> as illusory. In his view, a key flaw in the deterrence argument is that &quot;[t]he suppression doctrine vaguely assumes that law enforcement is a monolithic government enterprise&quot;<sup><a href="#one42">142</a></sup> when in fact it is not---individual officers have very little stake in or knowledge of the final outcome of particular cases, and thus are not deterred by the sanction of excluding evidence at trial. While this argument has some merit, it misconceives in several important ways the argument in favour of the exclusionary rule. First, the term &quot;deterrence&quot; is in some ways a misnomer for what the exclusionary rule does---it conjures up a vision of control based on punishment, operating like the criminal law. As a stick for chastising errant police officers, the exclusionary rule indeed falls short, since, as Burger C.J. points out, individual officers stand to lose very little personally by its operation. However, the
exclusionary rule is actually more concerned with removing incentives than with creating this type of &quot;deterrent&quot; effect---it relies more on eliminating carrots than on creating sticks. Seen in this way, the rule is much more sensible. After all, the police conduct searches and seizures for the purpose of making arrests and, in the long run, getting convictions. If they know that the outcome of a flagrant breach of the Constitution will be that their work is for naught, they will be less likely to engage in such breaches---even if they have no fear of personal sanction, police officers are not likely to want to waste their time.
<p>
While the precise benefits of the exclusionary rule may be difficult to quantify, this does not mean that they are nonexistent. In other areas, such as the right to counsel, it is indisputable that judicial pronouncements have had a genuine impact on police behaviour.<sup><a href="#one43">143</a></sup> Had the Court's statements on these matters not been backed up by the threat of the exclusionary rule, it is unlikely that the police would have adapted
to meet the minimum constitutional standard as quickly as they did.
<p>
Considering that Canadian courts have recognized that the exclusionary rule has a deterrent effect,<sup><a href="#one44">144</a></sup> the courts' refusal to explicitly consider the effect when deciding whether to apply the exclusionary rule is in some ways peculiar---if the deterrent effect is indeed significant, it should surely be a relevant factor in determining the applicability of the s. 24(2) remedy in a given case. In many decided cases, it is likely that deterrence of state misbehaviour actually has played a role in judges' decisions, but has been hidden behind discussions of &quot;the integrity of the justice system.&quot; Although deterrence and judicial integrity are often overlapping concerns, it can be argued that the clarity and consistency of the justice system are promoted by minimizing the use of covert tools as often as possible. If this is the case, bringing deterrence out in the open as an aspect of the s. 24(2) remedy should be seen as a positive development, even if one believes that it should not be
elevated to the pre-eminent position it occupies in U.S. doctrine.
<p>As noted earlier, a deterrent rationale for the exclusionary rule fits uncomfortably with a narrowly individualistic
conception of s. 8, but is consistent with a view of s. 8 that includes a broader societal interest in preventing state
misbehaviour (which Doernberg characterizes as a &quot;collective component&quot;<sup><a href="#one45">145</a></sup> of the right). As it was argued earlier that the inclusion of this latter understanding in s. 8 would assist in the full realization of the purpose of the right, it can also be argued that it would help create a theoretical foundation for the full realization of the s. 24(2) remedy.
<p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

Due to the relatively short time the <cite>Charter</cite> has existed, the full content of many of its protections has yet to be illuminated by the courts, and the rather arcane issue of third-party standing to challenge searches and seizures may remain a dark and unexplored corner of ss 8 and 24(2) for some time to come. Nevertheless, when the time arrives for the Supreme Court to consider the matter, it is to be hoped that the Court will learn from the U.S. experience and will refrain from blindly repeating American mistakes. While the Court has dropped some hints that it is prepared to chart its own course on the issue, what it will do when the issue is placed squarely before it remains to be seen.
<p>
As this article has suggested, the question of third-party standing is one that naturally involves deeper issues concerning the nature and purpose of the <cite>Charter</cite>'s rights and remedies. Resolving the third-party standing question by adopting a broad standing rule could thus provide the Court with an opportunity to articulate a broader and arguably better understanding of the nature of s. 8 rights and their associated remedy---one that includes a recognition of the protection they provide to society in general and to the rule of law. By doing so, the Court would place both right and remedy on a firmer basis, strengthening and clarifying the relationship between them. Seen in this way, the issue of third-party standing appears as more than just a minor technical problem in search and seizure law. As the American experience illustrates, building theoretical coherence into the law is more than merely an idle concern of legal academics---rather, the price that incoherent doctrine eventually extracts is paid in the form of inconsistent and ultimately irrational results, which harm both the justice system and society as a whole.

</blockquote>
<li><a name="four">The use of the term</a> &quot;standing&quot; in American and some Canadian search and seizure cases can be a source of considerable confusion. As the term implies, questions of standing involve the determination of whether or not a particular person is entitled to challenge the constitutionality of a search or seizure. This problem, however, can be broken down into two subsidiary questions:
<blockquote>
1.  Did the impugned state action violate the individual claimant's constitutional rights?
<p>
2. If the petitioner's own individual rights were not violated, can he or she nonetheless claim a remedy (such as the
exclusion of evidence) on the basis that the search violated the rights of a third party?
</blockquote>
As the term is used in other areas of constitutional law, only those cases falling under the second branch raise the question of standing---as Gibson and Gibson point out, cases under the first branch &quot;are not properly questions of standing at all: they are substantive questions of scope that every accused person should have the standing to raise in his or her defence&quot; (D. Gibson &amp; S. Gibson, &quot;Enforcement of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Section 24),&quot; in G.A. Beaudoin &amp; E. Ratushny, eds., <cite>The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite>, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 1989) 781 at 789). In the United States, however, courts have tended to classify all cases where a clear violation of a third party's rights took place as
&quot;standing&quot; cases, regardless of whether the petitioner was claiming that his or her own rights were also violated or was merely asserting a vicarious claim based on what had happened to the third party. This classification practice has continued, notwithstanding the fact that American courts have invariably rejected the idea that a truly
vicarious claim could ever be successful. As a result, cases that turn on essentially the same issue---for example, whether the claimant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched---are classified differently by American courts depending on whether or not the protected interest of a third party was also violated, even though the courts' analysis otherwise disregards the infringement of the third party's rights. For example, in <cite>Katz v. United States</cite>, 389 U.S. 347 (1967) (discussed <i>infra</i>) the issue was whether the petitioner had a reasonable expectation of privacy while in a public telephone booth, while <cite>Rawlings v. Kentucky</cite>, 448 U.S. 98 (1980) (also discussed <i>infra</i>) turned on whether the accused had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to goods stored in a friend's purse. <cite>Rawlings</cite>, however, is discussed in terms of standing while <cite>Katz</cite> is not, apparently because the search in <cite>Rawlings</cite> also violated the rights of the purse's owner. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has questioned whether this rather confusing division of the case law &quot;serves any useful analytical purpose&quot; (<cite>Rakas v. Illinois</cite>, 439 U.S. 128 at 138 (1979)), the Court has continued to use the distinction. Influenced by their American counterparts, a number of Canadian courts have also invoked the language of standing when referring to what were in essence substantive questions about the nature of the right in s. 8. For convenience this article will use the terminology of &quot;standing&quot; in the sense that it is used by the courts, despite its technical inaccuracy.

<p>
<li><a name="ninety9">In</a> <cite>Collins</cite>, <i>ibid.</i> at 18ff Lamer J. listed some of the factors he considered relevant, including:
<ul>
<li>what kind of evidence was obtained?
<li>what <cite>Charter</cite> right was violated?
<li>was the <cite>Charter</cite> violation serious or was it of a merely technical nature?
<li>was it deliberate, wilful or flagrant, or was it inadvertent and committed in good faith?
<li>did it occur in circumstances of urgency or necessity?
<li>were there other investigatory techniques available?
<li>would the evidence have been obtained in any event?
<li>is the offence serious?
<li>is the evidence essential to substantiate the charge?
<li>are other remedies available?
</ul>
As subsequent decisions have confirmed (see, for example, <cite>R. v. Wise</cite> (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.)), these factors are to be examined in light of three principles:
<blockquote>
1.  the effect of admission on the fairness of the trial process;<br>
2.  the seriousness of the violation; and<br>
3.  the effect of exclusion on the reputation of the administration of justice.
</blockquote>
<li><a name="onehundred">Note that in the United States,</a> where a range of different third-party standing rules apply under the various state constitutions, a number of subtle distinctions are drawn between various alternatives. In particular, the term &quot;target standing&quot; has often been used to refer to a rule whereby someone who was intended by the police to be the target at the time of the search has standing, but someone against whom evidence was discovered merely by accident does not. See LaFave, <i>supra</i> note 10 at 351. Such subtle differences are beyond the scope of this article, and for convenience the term &quot;target standing&quot; will be used in what follows to refer generically to <i>any</i> rule in which the person against whom seized evidence is tendered has standing to challenge the constitutionality of the search.
<p>
<li><a name="one01">That is,</a> the petitioner will be able to argue both that he or she had a privacy interest in the place searched and that the illegal police action had been directed at the petitioner.

<h1>Defending the Mentally Ill Client in Criminal Matters: Ethics, Advocacy, and Responsibility

<p><br>
<center><h3>ABSTRACT  / <a  href="http://www.law-lib.utoronto.ca/law-review/utlr52-1/martin.htm">Fulltext</a></h3></center>

Substantial incentives currently exist to channel mentally ill persons into the criminal justice system, particularly
under the auspices of the fitness criterion. For every mentally ill accused person there is at least one criminal defence lawyer, but ethical guidance for counsel acting in these difficult ethical circumstances is sparse. The author asserts that professional conduct codes, secondary source literature, <cite>Criminal Code</cite> provisions and related substantive case law are insufficient, standing alone, to respond to the unique issues and dilemmas raised
by the mentally ill client. The author turns to a diverse set of sources, including civil mental health legislation, principles of biomedical ethics, and key civil and criminal cases, to develop a set of Guiding Principles to assist defence counsel in resolving ethical dilemmas. These Principles are founded on the concept that the lawyer's role must be adapted to meet the special needs of the mentally ill client, and it is asserted that many of the rules and
conventions that govern the lawyer's relationship with the &quot;ordinary&quot; client must be modified or reinterpreted if the mentally ill client's interests are to be protected adequately in the criminal process. In particular, the Principles propose that the lawyer take &quot;reasonable steps&quot; to assist the accused in finding appropriate counsel, even when the lawyer has not been retained, or has withdrawn or been discharged; that &quot;capacity,&quot; &quot;consent,&quot; and &quot;substitute judgment&quot; tests be applied to clients whose fitness has not been tried, or whose unfitness has been judicially determined; and that the lawyer follow specified criteria when deciding whether or when to raise the fitness issue, whether to arrange a guilty plea or the
withdrawal of charges, and whether to consider herself constrained in the conduct of the defence by the mentally ill client's confession.

A une &eacute;poque o&ugrave; les seuils de l'enfermement civil involontaire et de traitement sont &eacute;lev&eacute;s et o&ugrave; les amendements aux clauses du Code p&eacute;nal concernant les maladies mentales ont accru l'accessibilit&eacute; et l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t suscit&eacute;s par l'&eacute;valuation et le processus de r&eacute;vision pour les personnes d&eacute;clar&eacute;es non-responsables ou incapables de compara&icirc;tre en cour, de nombreux motifs permettraient de canaliser les personnes atteintes de d&eacute;s&eacute;quilibre mental dans le syst&egrave;me judiciaire p&eacute;nal et tout particuli&egrave;rement sous les auspices du crit&egrave;re de capacit&eacute; mentale. Il y a au moins un avocat pour chaque malade mental accus&eacute;, mais les pr&eacute;c&eacute;dents en mati&egrave;re &eacute;thiques dans les cas de cette nature sont plut&ocirc;t rares. L'auteur affirme que les codes de conduite professionnelle, les &eacute;crits de seconde source, les articles du Code p&eacute;nal et la jurisprudence en la mati&egrave;re ne suffisent pas, s'ils ne s'appuient pas sur des fondements solides, pour r&eacute;pondre aux probl&egrave;mes sp&eacute;cifiques et aux dilemmes soulev&eacute;s par le client souffrant de troubles mentaux. L'auteur se tourne vers diverses sources regroupant les lois civiles en mati&egrave;re de sant&eacute; mentale, les principes de l'&eacute;thique biom&eacute;dicale, ainsi que des cas typiques de droit civil et p&eacute;nal afin de d&eacute;finir un ensemble de principes didactiques permettant d'aider l'avocat devant des dilemmes &eacute;thiques. Ces principes sont fond&eacute;s sur un concept qui veut que le r&ograve;le de l'avocat doit s'adapter aux besoins sp&eacute;cifiques du client atteint de troubles mentaux. L'auteur consid&egrave;re &eacute;galement qu'il est n&eacute;cessaire de
changer ou de r&eacute;interpr&eacute;ter plusieurs r&egrave;gles et conventions qui r&eacute;gissent les relations entre l'avocat et le client &quot;ordinaire&quot; si les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts du patient malade mental peuvent &ecirc;tre convenablement prot&eacute;g&eacute;s dans le processus p&eacute;nal. En outre, ces principes recommandent que l'avocat prenne les &quot;dispositions n&eacute;cessaires&quot; visant &agrave; aider l'accus&eacute; &agrave; trouver un avocat convenable, m&ecirc;me si l'avocat n'a pas &eacute;t&eacute; retenu, s'est retir&eacute; ou a &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;mis; que les tests de &quot;capacit&eacute;&quot;, de
&quot;consentement&quot; ou de &quot;subrogations&quot; soient appliqu&eacute;s aux clients dont la capacit&eacute; n'a pas &eacute;t&eacute; mise en cause, ou dont l'incapacit&eacute; l&eacute;gale a &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;tablie; et que l'avocat suive des crit&egrave;res pr&eacute;cis dans la d&eacute;cision de faire ou non relever le cas de l'incapacit&eacute; et &agrave; quel moment, dans le choix de plaider coupable ou de faire retirer l'accusation et de se consid&eacute;rer contraint dans la conduite de la d&eacute;fense par la confession du client malade mental.

<h1>Pornography, Harm, and Censorship: A Feminist (Re)Vision of the Right to Freedom of Expression

<p><br>
<center><h3>ABSTRACT  / <a  href="http://www.law-lib.utoronto.ca/law-review/utlr52-1/quist.htm">Fulltext</a></h3></center>

In <cite>R. v. Butler</cite>, the Supreme Court of Canada held that while the anti-obscenity provisions in the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> constitute a limitation of the right to freedom of expression guaranteed in s. 2(b) of the <cite>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite>, the limitation can be justified on the basis of the harm that pornography causes to women. Because the court based its judgment on the traditional liberal understanding of the purposes of freedom of expression, however, it misconceived the nature of the harm caused by pornography, searching unsuccessfully, for example, for causal links between pornography and violence towards women. Some feminist theorists also approach pornography in this way, and argue that censorship is the &quot;solution&quot; to the harm caused by pornography. The author argues, however, that such an analysis leads to a misguided opposition between feminism and freedom of expression and implicates feminism in an understanding of freedom of  expression that itself contains the same patriarchal values that inform traditional liberalism. The author then shows that feminist and poststructuralist theories of language yield a richer analysis of pornography which focuses on its constitutive role in creating the discourse within which women and their sexuality come to be understood within society. From this perspective, it is possible to move beyond the traditional emphasis on censorship as the antidote to pornography, and to develop a positive conception of the right to free expression that would enable women to create alternative understandings of their experience, which can be counterposed to the traditional patriarchal discourse that pornography exemplifies.

<P>

<p><br>
In <cite>R. v. Butler</cite>,<sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup> the Supreme Court of Canada struggled to reconcile the issue of pornography with its own doctrinal interpretation of the right to freedom of expression as guaranteed in s. 2(b) of the <cite>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite>.<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup> The difficulties encountered---particularly in finding a &quot;causal&quot; relationship
between pornography and &quot;harm&quot; to women as a group---can be explained in large part by the continuing influence of liberal philosophy on the contemporary judicial understanding of freedom of expression, and the resulting failure to comprehend the enigmatic and indeterminate nature of the pornographic message. Liberal philosophy has been incorporated into the Supreme Court's definition of the right to freedom of expression through the adoption of the traditional liberal &quot;purposes&quot; for protecting expression. In turn, these purposes stem from particular assumptions about human beings (or, more aptly, &quot;man&quot;), society, and language, and how these concepts are related to one another. As they are not always realized in human experience, the assumptions are also held out as social ideals---goals to be aspired to in the liberal vision of a just and
good society.
<p>
These assumptions, however, are dangerously simplistic and partial. As will be shown, they provide an inadequate and misguided basis for understanding the depth and complexity of the &quot;harm&quot; to women and society that results from pornography. Furthermore, the assumptions are fundamentally gendered, having their roots in a
philosophical tradition that has excluded women, both from the very act of constructing them, as well as from their meaning. The reliance on these assumptions and ideals in judicial doctrine implicates the history and contemporary manifestations of gender inequality; it implicates relations of power and domination. These assertions problematize the judicial doctrine of the right to freedom of expression as guaranteed in the <cite>Charter</cite>. Indeed, they
begin to suggest the dangers attending the uncritical acceptance of the stated purposes of freedom of expression and their underlying premises---namely, that the judicial doctrine itself will serve as a vehicle for the re-creation of the status quo, legitimating and reinforcing existing power relations and the exclusion of women's voices and concerns. The problem of pornography provides a telling example of how this danger is a real---and realized---one.
<p>
The central premise of this article is that freedom of expression, and its judicial-doctrinal interpretation, is <i>in
itself</i> a feminist issue. Among North American feminists, any consideration of this right has tended to reduce to the issue of pornography, where a debate has been waged about whether pornography causes &quot;harm&quot; to women and whether it should be censored. Very little attention has been given by feminists to the philosophical and
judicial construction of the right itself or its transformative potential. Yet, to continue to conduct the debate over pornography within the parameters of the prescribed meaning of freedom of expression, particularly its construction as a <i>negative</i> right, is to re-create a set of assumptions that is part of the patriarchal structure and to close the door to alternative visions of human beings, society, and what freedom of expression might mean for women and men.
<p>
This article will begin by examining the assumptions that underpin the stated purposes of the right to freedom of expression. Then, drawing on feminist theory, it will critically assess these assumptions, revealing both their gendered meanings and their inadequacy for comprehending the pornographic message and its impact on women, men, and society. As will be seen, this impact is not an external, <i>causal</i> one. Indeed, in the <cite>Butler</cite> decision, the Supreme Court's efforts to find such a causal link appear to have been futile. While there may be some instances in which pornography directly spurs a man to abuse or use violence against a
woman, and while there is the very real problem of so-called &quot;snuff&quot; films in which women are actually killed in the production, the more widespread and insidious harm resulting from pornography can be seen only from the perspective of a more complex understanding of the relationship between expression and action than that implicit in the liberal theory of free expression.
<p>
It will be suggested that such an understanding is offered by feminist poststructuralist theory, which sees pornography as a <i>constitutive discourse</i> rather than an external and causative force. As a constitutive discourse, pornography does not have a fixed or essential meaning; its meaning is contingent, indeterminate, and the
site of political struggle. It is the indeterminacy of the pornographic message that haunts those who search for a <i>causal</i> relationship between pornography and actual violence. It is also this indeterminacy that looms over feminist debates about harm and censorship. While its meaning is neither fixed nor essential, pornography does have a powerful, dominant meaning within the context of patriarchal structures and relations. This dominant meaning asserts particular gender identities, namely male sexual dominance and female enjoyment of violence and degradation. While pornography has other possible meanings, these are marginalized by the power and apparent inevitability of the patriarchal message. The concept of constitutive discourse means that the meaning of pornography is <i>internalized</i> by individual men and women so as to become part of their <i>subjectivities</i>, although not all men and women are affected in the same way. Indeed, pornography has different, even contradictory, meanings for women as well as men. Any attempt at a monolithic definition of pornography that asserts its meaning as an institution of patriarchy and a form of violence against women must be an exclusive definition (as all definitions usually are).
<p>
The article will then re-examine the issues of harm and censorship in light of the insights of feminist poststructuralist theory. Importantly, this perspective, which enables a recognition of pornography's enigmatic and contingent nature, opens up the debate about pornography by allowing for a more inclusive discussion of the meaning of pornography and its role in a patriarchal society. By characterizing pornography as a constitutive discourse, feminist poststructuralism renders the harm of pornography &quot;visible.&quot; The harm is not a physical or directly observable harm, but one that works from within by constituting our subjectivities. As part of who we are, the dominant message of pornography works to reinforce the discourses and institutions of patriarchy through the actions and expression of individual men and women. Thus, the insights of feminist poststructuralist theory suggest that women <i>do</i> need to object to and challenge pornography's sexist messages. However,
because meanings are not fixed or essential, the apparent &quot;solution&quot; some feminists see in state censorship does not necessarily follow from a recognition of harm. From a feminist poststructuralist vantage point, the question of what to do about pornography becomes more complex, more problematic, more political and strategic. Pornography is a challenge riddled with political-legal dilemmas for feminists. Yet these dilemmas have been obscured by a polemic and static debate about harm and censorship.
<p>
Finally, it will be submitted that the indeterminacy of the pornographic message, and of meanings more generally, suggests the possibility of resistance and change without censorship---the possibility of transforming not only the pornographic message but also the right to freedom of expression itself. In the final section, I will begin to outline an alternative set of purposes for protecting the right which both affirm the importance of &quot;free expression&quot; and make it more meaningful for women and other oppressed groups who are struggling to have their voices heard in an unequal society.
<p>
<h3>The Purposes of the Right to Freedom of Expression: Drawing Out the Assumptions</h3>

The Supreme Court of Canada has adopted a purposive approach to the definition of rights guaranteed in the <cite>Charter</cite>. In <cite>Hunter v. Southam Inc.</cite>,<sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup> it was established that, before determining whether or not a right has been infringed, the Court must first specify the purpose of a right in order to delineate the nature of the interests it is meant to protect. In defining the nature and
scope of the right to freedom of expression, the Court has articulated three &quot;core&quot; purposes: promotion of the search for truth, participation in the political process, and individual self-fulfilment.<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup> Each of these three purposes can be traced to liberal philosophy and liberal understandings of the role of free expression in a democratic society. Specifically, the core purposes are those advanced by Thomas Emerson in his classic article &quot;Toward a General Theory of the First Amendment.&quot;<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup> This approach should not be surprising, as the <cite>Charter</cite> is essentially a liberal document, setting out rights formulated to guarantee the liberty of the individual in the face of collective or state power.<sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup>
<p>
Derived from liberal theory, these purposes are guided by and grounded in particular liberal assumptions about the nature of human beings, society, language, and expression, and the relationships among these constructs. Furthermore, they stem from and support the view of freedom of expression as a &quot;negative&quot; right---a right to be free from interference by other individuals and by the collectivity---which itself has significant implications. I will begin by examining each purpose and exposing the premises on which it is grounded and from which it derives its meaning. Then, in the following section, I will suggest the inadequacies and fallacies of these assumptions.
<p>
First, however, a brief word about my use of the term &quot;liberalism&quot; is warranted here. While the purposes of freedom of expression, and the assumptions that underpin them, are rooted in the liberal tradition of thought, it should be noted that &quot;liberalism&quot; is in no way a monolithic or cumulative philosophy. Despite the variety within this tradition, there are certain core principles that characterize liberal thought, such as an unwavering faith in the individual and individual initiative, as well as the priority of liberty over other values. The focus here will be on those aspects of the liberal tradition that have shaped the right to freedom of expression, and that have been incorporated into contemporary judicial doctrine through the continued reliance on the traditional liberal purposes for guaranteeing the right.
<p>
The first purpose of freedom of expression is to promote society's search for truth and knowledge. This is an idea that can be traced to the writings of John Stuart Mill. In his treatise <cite>On Liberty</cite>,<sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup> Mill explained the importance of free expression for arriving at truth:
<blockquote>
First, if any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may for aught we can certainly know, be true. To deny this
is to assume our own infallibility. Secondly, though the silenced opinion be in error, it may, and very commonly does, contain a portion of the truth; and since the general or prevailing opinion on any subject is rarely or never the whole truth, it is only by the collision of adverse opinions that the remainder of the truth has any chance of being supplied. Thirdly, even if the received opinion be not only true, but the whole truth; unless it is suffered to be, and
actually is, vigorously and earnestly contested, it will, by most of those who receive it, be held in the manner of prejudice, with little comprehension or feeling of its rational grounds. And not only this, but, fourthly, the meaning of the doctrine itself will be in danger of being lost, or enfeebled, and deprived of its vital effect on the character and conduct: the dogma of becoming a mere formal profession, inefficacious for good, but cumbering the ground, and preventing the growth of any real and heartfelt conviction, from reason or personal experience.<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Thus, freedom of expression is necessary to ensure that the most sound and most rational decision is arrived at by considering all the facts and arguments that can be put forth on behalf of any proposition. It is because human beings are not infallible that truth can come only from this clash of ideas.<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup>
<p>
This understanding of how society can and should attain truth and knowledge rests on the assumption that there is indeed a &quot;truth,&quot; seen also as an ideal, which can be found through Reason. Mill suggests that there is a &quot;preponderance&quot; among mankind of rational opinions and rational conduct, and through the human capacity for Reason &quot;[w]rong opinions and practices gradually yield to fact and argument.&quot;<sup><a href="#ten">10</a></sup> In other words, wrong ideas can be <i>corrected</i> by Reason and the free  expression/clash of ideas. Reason is a concept not unique to liberal thought. With its roots in Greek philosophy, Reason has formed the central pursuit of the Western tradition of philosophy and it has had a variety of meanings
ascribed to it. In the context of the purposes of freedom of expression, Reason is understood as the distinctly human capacity for abstract and objective thought, uninfluenced by emotion or other subjective factors. It represents the human capacity to transcend the particularity of circumstances and relationships. Importantly, human fallibility does not negate the essentially rational nature of human beings. Thomas Emerson laments:
<blockquote>
Human judgment is a frail thing. It may err in being subject to emotion, prejudice or personal interest. It suffers from lack of information, insight or inadequate thinking. It . . . must always remain incomplete and subject to further extension, refinement, rejection or modification.<sup><a href="#eleven">11</a></sup>
</blockquote>
However, he maintains the assumption and ideal of rational transcendence and the ability of men of Reason to arrive at the truth.
<p>
The view that false speech can be corrected by &quot;more speech&quot; and human Reason leads to and supports the further idea that expression in itself is not typically harmful; it &quot;is normally conceived as doing less injury to other social goals than action.&quot;<sup><a href="#twelve">12</a></sup> The consequences of action are
distinguished from those of speech. While the effects of action are generally immediate, instantaneous and irremediable, those of speech are not; the latter can be countered with &quot;truth,&quot; which the man of Reason will recognize. Thus, when Mill states that &quot;the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others,&quot;<sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup> the implication is that it is <i>physical</i> acts that cause harm and that justify limitations on individual freedom. As Emerson points out,
<blockquote>
. . . [T]he essence of a system of freedom of expression lies in the distinction between expression and action. The whole theory rests upon the general proposition that expression must be free and unrestrained, that the state may not seek to achieve other social objectives through control of expression, and that the attainment of such objectives can and must be secured through regulation of action. The dynamics of the system require that this line be carefully drawn and strictly adhered to.<sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup>
</blockquote>
It should be noted that this radical separation of speech and action is more characteristic of American First Amendment jurisprudence. Canadian jurisprudence takes a more sophisticated view of the difference between speech and action, distinguishing between the <i>form</i> of expression and its <i>content</i>. The Supreme Court has recognized that expression has both content and form, and that the two can be inextricably connective. Activity can be expressive if it attempts to convey meaning.<sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup> According to
this view, the concept of form contains <i>within it</i> a distinction between thought and action. While some activity does convey meaning, thereby constituting expression, other activity does not and, in turn, will not be protected under s. 2(b) of the <cite>Charter</cite>. It is unclear, however, where the line between pure action and expressive action is to be drawn, and the Supreme Court has not provided any principled way to approach this problem.
<p>
The search for truth is often characterized in terms of a &quot;free market-place of ideas,&quot; an image analogous to the concept of a free economic market and frequently used in the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court. Truth requires an &quot;open competition&quot; among competing ideas and claims to truth. This characterization reveals another assumption: human beings are seen as equal in their capacity for reason and in their opportunities for expressing themselves. Freedom of expression, understood as a <i>negative</i> right entailing a right of individuals to be free from restraints and governmental interference, assumes that in the absence of such interference all individuals have an equal freedom to express their opinions. &quot;Equality&quot; in this context means &quot;formal&quot; equality, that is, the equal application of the law to all. As freedom is the natural state of man and, in turn, defined as the absence of restraint, laws (which constitute restraints) must be applied equally to all in order to guarantee equal freedom.
<p>
The second purpose of freedom of expression is to promote participation in the political process through open discussion &quot;which is available to all members of the community.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup> This purpose is grounded in a vision of a democratic society in which all persons share in the making of social decisions. Emerson suggests that this vision also embraces the right of all to participate in the building of <i>culture</i>. Again, there is an assumption here that in the absence of governmental restraint on free expression, all members of a society do have equal voice and equal opportunity to participate.
<p>
Finally, freedom of expression is protected under the <cite>Charter</cite> because it is seen to promote individual self-fulfilment. This purpose supports freedom of expression not merely as a means to democracy and truth, but as a good <i>in itself</i>. It also reflects a faith in, and focus on, the <i>individual</i>. Emerson argues that the proper end of human beings is to see the realization of their characters and potentialities.<sup><a href="#seventeen">17</a></sup> Human beings have powers to reason, to imagine, and to feel, and it is through the development of these that each of us finds our meaning and place in the world. Expression, then, is integral to the &quot;affirmation of the self,&quot; with the &quot;self&quot; being understood as a unified and coherent whole. This process of self-fulfilment is seen as an individual one; it is a process of <i>self-determination.</i> As Emerson explains, each person's &quot;mind is his own and its functioning is necessarily an individual affair.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup>
<p>
This understanding of the individual is premised on the assumption and ideal of <i>autonomy</i>. Autonomy is defined reactively as self-control and self-mastery, and it implies that individuals, by their nature, are separated from one another---physically and mentally. As Mill states: &quot;Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.&quot;<sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a></sup> The individual is seen to have an inherent
personality that can be realized through thought and expression. Here language is understood as having an independent existence apart from the individual who hears and speaks, with the meaning of words being determined and fixed by an external reality. The rational individual thus receives a message and deliberates on it. Its meaning can be objectively known. The individual may choose to act on the message, or she may not. In this way, the autonomous, rational individual mediates expression. 
<p>
The value of freedom is tied to the ideal of autonomy. Separateness from others means freedom from others---that is, negative freedom, or liberty. As F.A. von Hayek explains, liberty &quot;assures the individual of the right within a known domain to pursue his own aims on the basis of his own knowledge.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty">20</a></sup> The assumption of equality also underpins autonomy. As each individual is by nature autonomous, we are all equal in our autonomy and, in turn, our freedom. It is the role of the government, through the making of laws and the equal application of these laws to all, to promote this autonomy by protecting the freedom of each person up to the point where the freedom of others is threatened. 
<p>
Thus, the purposes defining the right to freedom of expression contain within them the assumption that individuals have an <i>essential</i> nature. They are rational, equal in their freedom, unified, autonomous, and self-defining. Such individuals stand apart from language, which is external and whose meanings are fixed by an objective, knowable reality. Expression, in conjunction with freedom of thought, is a central means by which individuals
realize their inherent personalities as well as &quot;truth.&quot; Importantly, these assumptions also serve as ideals toward which humankind should aspire; they serve as the goals to which the protection of the right of freedom of expression must be directed.
<p>
All of these assumptions and ideals have been called into question by feminist scholars, who have argued that they are not only inadequate and misleading representations of human experience, but they are also deeply and profoundly gendered. Their philosophical construction has both excluded women and constituted women as the
<i>Other</i>---that is, as the very negation of what is valued and idealized. The next section will draw on feminist theory to assess critically the underpinnings of freedom of expression doctrine.
<p>
<h3>Feminist Critiques of the Assumptions and Purposes of the Right to Freedom of Expression</h3>

As noted, the assumptions underlying the doctrinal interpretation of the right to freedom of expression implicate a
formal view of equality, which defines equality as the equal application of the law to all. In contrast to this view, the Supreme Court has adopted a &quot;group disadvantage&quot; approach to equality as it is guaranteed under s. 15 of the <cite>Charter</cite>.<sup><a href="#twenty1">21</a></sup> This approach recognizes <i>systemic</i> inequality in Canadian society and the historical disadvantage that continues to support both overt and structural discrimination against particular <i>groups</i>, including women. Furthermore, it acknowledges that <i>substantive</i> equality may in particular instances require the <i>unequal</i> application of law. These two views of equality sit uneasily beside one another in the Court's jurisprudence. From the perspective of the group disadvantage approach, it becomes difficult to maintain the assumption implicated in the freedom of expression
doctrine that, absent governmental interference, all individuals are equal in their freedom of expression and participate on an equal basis in the social and political decision-making processes. Indeed, an important feminist critique is that &quot;free speech&quot; does not in fact exist. Formulated as a negative right, freedom of expression &quot;tends to presuppose that whole segments of the population are not systematically silenced <i>socially</i>, prior to government action.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty2">22</a></sup> In a society of inequality, members of disadvantaged groups have not had equal access to decision-making processes, politically,
economically, or socially. Economic inequalities are particularly serious for freedom of expression, as access to the pervasive, privately-controlled media has become a central means of asserting ideas and alternative visions of society. Disadvantaged groups, then, have not had equal power to express themselves in the supposedly &quot;free&quot; market-place of ideas. Indeed, it has been argued that such groups are <i>silenced</i> by the overwhelming dominance of the ideas of the ruling group---namely, able-bodied, heterosexual, Christian white males.
<p>
It is significant that this inequality of free expression was not recognized in the Supreme Court's decision in <cite>Butler</cite>. While the Court acknowledged women's inequality in society, it did not draw any connection between, on the one hand, this general group disadvantage and the discriminatory effects of pornography, and, on
the other, women's lack of access to the means of expression. The tension in the <cite>Charter</cite> between negative, <i>individual</i> rights (such as freedom of expression) and so-called <i>collective</i> rights (such as equality understood in substantive terms) is apparent in the <cite>Butler</cite> decision, as the Court struggled to
reconcile its doctrinal interpretation of s. 2(b) with the claim of group-based harm by searching for a &quot;causal link&quot; between pornography and &quot;changes&quot; in men's attitudes and behaviour. However, the Court did not confront this tension or attempt to go below the surface and consider the conflicting premises on which its
analysis was based. As a result, the assumption of equality contained in the purposes of the right to freedom of expression remained intact. Yet, by not recognizing this inequality---by assuming it away or masking it---the s. 2(b) right itself serves to perpetuate existing inequalities, regardless of the outcome of a particular case. It serves to avoid the fact that for disadvantaged groups, &quot;. . . the urgent issue of freedom of speech is not primarily the avoidance of state intervention as such, but finding an affirmative means to get access to speech for those to whom it has been denied.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty3">23</a></sup> While this criticism does not undermine the notion of formal equality implicit in freedom of expression doctrine (which does not deny that there is an unequal
distribution of resources in society, including access to communication resources), it does raise important questions about the adequacy of the concepts of formal equality and negative freedom for promoting the freedom of expression of <i>all</i> members of society.
<p>
The assumptions of truth and Reason are also problematic. Reason, in the context of freedom of expression doctrine, is understood as the capacity for abstract and objective thought. However, the claim to objectivity has come under increasing criticism in the social sciences (as well as the natural sciences), most notably by scholars influenced by poststructuralist and postmodern social theory. That there is no neutral place from which to view the world has also been a central tenet of feminist scholarship, which has sought to expose the gendered content of apparently neutral rules and premises.
<p>
Reason has itself been the subject of feminist analysis. Genevieve Lloyd has undertaken a critical review of Western
philosophical formulations of Reason.<sup><a href="#twenty4">24</a></sup> Lloyd notes that Reason has not only inspired Western ideals of objective knowledge, but it has also figured in our assessments of <i>character</i>: &quot;It is incorporated not only into our criteria of truth, but also into our understanding of what it is to be a person at all.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty5">25</a></sup> While the &quot;aspiration to a Reason common to all, transcending the contingent historical circumstances which differentiate minds from one another, lies at the very heart of our philosophical heritage,&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty6">26</a></sup> Lloyd argues that Reason is not an inherent capacity of human beings. Rather, it is a socially constructed concept. Moreover, it is a concept that is
profoundly gendered.
<p>
The ideal of Reason has been associated with the &quot;masculine&quot; identity, while that which the Man of Reason has sought to transcend, transform, or control---namely, the particularity of life, contingency, disorder, emotion, passion, and connection---has been associated with the &quot;feminine&quot; identity and Nature. Within this framework, the masculine identity is equated with superiority, and the feminine identity is devalued. Thus, what have been deemed to be distinctly &quot;feminine&quot; traits have been excluded from the ideal of Reason. As Lloyd explains, &quot;What has happened has not been a simple exclusion of women, but a constitution of femininity through that exclusion.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty7">27</a></sup> The philosophical construction of Reason, then, has been central to the conceptualization and institutionalization of <i>gender difference</i> and <i>gender hierarchy.</i>
<p>
The ideal of Reason, as well as past differences in the lives of women and men, continue to haunt male and female consciousness and lived experience. To assume in our understanding of the right to freedom of expression that there exists a human capacity for Reason, as defined by the Western philosophical tradition, is to propagate an assumption and ideal that exclude and devalue women's experiences. This is not to say that the appropriate response is to include women by asserting the distinctly &quot;feminine&quot; traits. Indeed, as Lloyd points out, &quot;The idea that women have their own distinctive kind of intellectual or moral character has itself been partly formed within
the philosophical tradition to which it may now appear to be a reaction.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty8">28</a></sup> As a result, 
<blockquote>
[u]nless the structural features of our concepts of gender are understood, any emphasis on a supposedly distinctive style of thought or morality is liable to be caught up in a deeper, older structure of male norms and female complements. The affirmation of the value and importance of &quot;the feminine&quot; cannot of itself be expected to shake the underlying normative structures, for, ironically, it will occur in a space already prepared for it by the intellectual tradition it seeks to reject.<sup><a href="#twenty9">29</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Lloyd leaves open the possibility that there is &quot;a Reason genuinely common to all.&quot; If it exists, &quot;it is something to be achieved in the future, not celebrated in the present.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty">30</a></sup>
<p>
Because Reason---the apparent means to the attainment of truth---is a socially constructed value and a concept that has excluded the lived experiences of women, the notion of &quot;truth&quot; in the Court's freedom of expression doctrine becomes suspect. Indeed, truth appears to have a dangerous connection with social power and hierarchy. As suggested by the discussion of Reason---long held out as a truth about &quot;man&quot;---the voices of the powerful can impose their values and ideals on others and parade them as &quot;truth.&quot; The intimate relationship between truth and power is rendered even more perilous in the context of an assumption of equal freedom, including freedom of expression. This is so because the inequalities of power are masked by formal equality. In this web, domination comes to appear <i>natural</i> and <i>inevitable</i>. It is in this way that
pornography masquerades as the true expression of women's and men's sexuality. The pornographic message, created <i>by</i> men largely <i>for</i> men, is sent and received in the context of patriarchal relations and apparently equal freedom of expression. The full implications of its power, including its reinforcing effect on
discrimination against women and its &quot;silencing&quot; of women as a group, have been rendered invisible when viewed through the lens of the purposes of the right to freedom of expression. Just what these full implications are will be discussed shortly.
<p>
It must be noted that any attempt to assess critically the limitations and gender bias of the doctrinal assumptions of Reason and, in turn, truth, runs up against a serious hurdle. These assumptions linger, not only in the doctrinal interpretation of freedom of expression, but also in the law more generally. Courts, for example, continue to understand their own legitimacy in terms of a &quot;neutral&quot; justice founded on &quot;facts&quot; and objective reasoning. Thus, to question Reason and truth is to question the role of the Courts themselves.
<p>
Just as problematic as equality, Reason, and truth, is the assumption and ideal of individual autonomy. This single premise, which envisions human beings as separate, discrete, and self-determining, implicates many others---including Reason---and is far-reaching in its influence on how we think about individual selfhood, society, and expression. A variety of criticisms has been levelled against this assumption by feminists, some of which are more
persuasive and helpful than others.
<p>
For example, Robin West has argued that the conceptualization of human beings as discrete and unconnected while &quot;trivially true&quot; of men is &quot;patently untrue&quot; of women.<sup><a href="#thirty1">31</a></sup> She suggests that one of the central insights of recent feminist theory is that women are <i>essentially connected</i> rather than <i>essentially separate.</i> They are connected to human life both materially---through pregnancy, intercourse, and breast-feeding---and, as a result, existentially---through their moral and practical lives. The material fact of connectedness leads to a world view that is radically different from that implied by the notion of autonomy. It is a world of relationships, responsibility, caring, and intimacy, with a notion of selfhood as being constructed through relationships.<sup><a href="#thirty2">32</a></sup> This world view stands in contrast to that of the autonomous male who understands the world in terms of competition with others for freedom and separate selfhood. West is careful to note that this existential state of connectedness is in no sense biologically <i>mandated</i>, but it is nevertheless biologically <i>grounded</i>. While these claims assert women's existential connectedness, rather than autonomy, and suggest that women's experience is excluded from any assumption of autonomy, they do not offer an historical explanation of women's difference or offer a sustained critique of autonomy in and of itself.
<p>
Catherine Keller has also considered the assumption and ideal of autonomy, or, as she refers to it, the &quot;separate self.&quot; She traces the construction of the notion of separate selfhood from Greek mythology and heroic tales. With a long cultural and philosophical history, separation has become an ideal that has taken hold of Western imaginations:
<blockquote>
To be a self, must I be something separate and apart? How else could I be myself? Myth and religion, philosophy and psychology center our civilization on the assumption that an individual is a discrete being: I am cleanly divided from the surrounding world of persons and places; I remain essentially the same self from moment to moment. Common sense identifies separateness with the freedom we cherish in the name of &quot;independence&quot; and &quot;autonomy.&quot; The assumption that selfhood requires separation is even rooted in language. The Latin for
&quot;self,&quot; <i>se</i> meaning &quot;on one's own,&quot; yields with <i>parare</i> (&quot;to prepare&quot;) the verb &quot;to separate.&quot; For our culture it is separation which prepares the way for
selfhood.<sup><a href="#thirty3">33</a></sup>
</blockquote>
She argues that the separate self is an illusion, &quot;because willy-nilly each subject exists in interdependence with its world.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty4">34</a></sup>
<blockquote>
However much the ego feels single and apart, this feeling may represent not truth but denial. It is less precise to call this ego separate than <i>separative</i>, implying an activity or an intention rather than any fundamental state of being. . . . Its sense of itself as separate, as over and against the world, the Other, and even its own body, endows it with its identity. It is <i>this</i>, not <i>that</i>.<sup><a href="#thirty5">35</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Keller further argues that the separative self is <i>gendered</i>, as separation and sexism have functioned together. In the fear of self-loss, connectedness, merger, and the influence of others that motivates all insistence on separate selfhood &quot;lurks a profound fear of women.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty6">36</a></sup> The separative self,
which is identifiable historically (but neither essentially nor necessarily) with males and the masculine, has constructed itself on the basis of, and at the expense of, women, whom it has constructed as the Other---the connected, the dependent, the &quot;soluble self.&quot; The separative self externalizes relationship by projecting and imposing both the threats and comforts of relationship onto the Other. Yet, the fundamental opposition between self and Other is in fact dialectical, as it &quot;serves the dual purpose of establishing the self's sense of its inner independence from influence and compensating for the haunting fear that that independence is illusory. As it cannot embrace interdependence, it ironically comes to depend upon the dependent Other, in reality or fantasy.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty7">37</a></sup> Interestingly enough, but in no way surprising, it is this dialectical opposition that pornography re-creates---the construction of the &quot;soluble feminine self&quot; who
dissolves into the needs and demands of the separative masculine self, the woman who exists as object to serve the identity needs of man the subject. Yet, the pornographic image reveals a dependency of the masculine on the feminine---a need for some form of connectedness (albeit a destructive form). 
<p>
Thus, the assumption and ideal of the masculine separate self, which is closely tied to the philosophical construct of Reason, has also played a central role in constructing and justifying the oppression of women. As with Reason, autonomy is defined at the expense of, and in opposition to, women and femininity. The connectedness that West tells us is part of women's experience, has been, at least in part, constructed and imposed by the separative self. In turn, it has been crucial in defining women's <i>devalued</i> roles as mothers, nurturers, and homemakers. The
maintenance of the ideal of autonomy through freedom of expression doctrine both denies women's experience, as well as men's, and holds out an illusory and gendered goal. This means that any claim by women to &quot;what men have&quot;---that is, autonomy---as well as any claim that women are more connected, runs up against the danger of (re)creating the prior conceptual framework within which gender difference and gender hierarchy have been constructed. Keller argues that the alternatives of autonomy and relation represent a false choice. Connectedness, both to individuals and to society more generally, represents the experience of both men and women.
<p>
Jennifer Nedelsky has argued that what feminism requires is a new conception of autonomy.<sup><a href="#thirty8">38</a></sup> &quot;The prevailing concept stands at the core of liberal theory and carries with it the individualism characteristic of liberalism. Such a conception cannot meet the aspirations of feminism.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty9">39</a></sup> Nedelsky points out that liberalism takes atomistic individuals as the basic units of political and legal theory &quot;and thus fails to recognize the inherently social nature of human beings.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty">40</a></sup> Individuals are not self-made nor are they essentially separate. She suggests that:
<blockquote>
We come into being in a social context that is literally <i>constitutive of us</i>. Some of our most essential
characteristics, such as our capacity for language and the conceptual framework through which we see the world, are not made by us, but given to us (or developed in us) through our interactions with others. [emphasis added]<sup><a href="#forty1">41</a></sup> 
</blockquote>
Thus, relationships are central to constituting the self. In contrast, the ideal of autonomy denies the strength that the self derives from its context of relations. Furthermore, as an individual sphere of unfettered action and thought, autonomy requires for its realization the erection of <i>boundaries</i> around the self in order to keep out the influence and desires of others. One of the most important forms of boundary our society erects is <i>negative
rights</i>, including the right to freedom of expression. As has been noted, freedom of expression guarantees that the autonomous individual is free to express himself/herself without coercion or restraint from others or society up to the point where that freedom intrudes on the freedom of others. Nedelsky argues that the essence of autonomy in its liberal incarnation is the <i>power</i> to close out others. This power is not a form of inner strength; rather, it is a power <i>from</i> and <i>over</i> others. An important part of autonomy is seen to be the exercise of <i>control</i> and <i>choice</i>, not only over objects but over other people. Thus, the sought-after illusion of security is achieved through power, domination, and isolation.<sup><a href="#forty2">42</a></sup> The exercise of this power, and the relationships it structures, are masked by the assumption of autonomy and by the boundaries constructed around individuals. For example, as was discussed above, the unequal access of women to free expression is hidden and maintained through the formulation of the right to freedom of expression in negative terms---that is, in terms of a boundary.
<p>
It is suggested that the basic value of autonomy is one that feminism must retain while rejecting its &quot;liberal incarnation.&quot; Feminists want to free women to shape their own lives rather than be shaped by men and patriarchy. They do not want to deny or renounce the individual, nor do they seek to privilege a patriarchal
community. In this way, feminism differs from many communitarian theories in its critique of liberal individualism. For feminism, the problem with individual autonomy is not so much that it prioritizes the individual and his/her desires over the needs of the community, but that it denies the crucial relationship between the individual and the community and thereby denies some of the important ways in which power and domination are exercised. Nedelsky proposes a reconceptualization of autonomy: &quot;relational autonomy.&quot; Rather than assuming and seeking separateness, autonomy must be understood in the context of <i>relationships,</i> because what actually enables
people to be autonomous is not isolation but constructive connection---relationships not distorted by power and domination. According to this view of autonomy, the &quot;self&quot; becomes a <i>capacity,</i> a <i>process,</i> rather than a fixed substance. Understanding autonomy in this way allows for a consideration of how our relationships with others shape our choices and options in life, and opens the possibility of increasing those options through a restructuring of social relationships.
<p>
These feminist critiques of autonomy counter the assumption of a separate, fixed, and self-defining individual in need of protection---through such rights as freedom of expression---against interference by the collective with its selfhood and its freedom. They suggest, instead, that the individual is fundamentally related to other individuals and to society/culture more generally. Moreover, they assert that individual identity is constituted in and by these relationships. The question now becomes: What is the role of language and expression in these constitutive relationships? More specifically, what is the role of pornography?
<p>
<h3>Language and Expression: Constituting the Self and Subjectivity</h3>

As discussed above, the claim that individuals are self-determining, autonomous, and rational leads to a view of
expression as a means of asserting the innate views and personality of the author, or the self. Language is thus external to the individual, and meaning is determined by an objective, knowable &quot;reality.&quot; In turn, expression is received by the unified, separate self and processed through the self's rational capacity (as potentially modified by prejudice). Importantly, the message is seen to have a clear, fixed meaning, which exists independently of the individual who hears it. The autonomous individual is then free to choose how he or she acts on the messages received. In contrast, a recognition of constitutive social relationships points to a very different role for language and expression. When we think about our relationships to others and to the society in which we live, we cannot help but notice that those relationships are conducted in large part through language and expression.
<p>
In seeking to understand better the role of expression and the significance of pornography, the work of Chris Weedon is particularly helpful.<sup><a href="#forty3">43</a></sup> Drawing on the writings of Ferdinand de Saussure, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucault, among others, Weedon has sought to develop a feminist poststructuralist theory of the relationship among language, subjectivity, social organization, and power within the context of patriarchy. She argues that poststructuralism is a useful approach for feminism, as its focus on
language, subjectivity, and relations of power help to explain many of the key relationships, processes, and structures that (re)create women's oppression, such as: how knowledge is produced and what type of knowledge is produced; how power is exercised through language and meaning; the existence of competing subjective realities and the social interests on behalf of which they work; resistance to change; and the relationship between material conditions and subjectivities. In addition, its view of the individual as the site of competing subjectivities acknowledges, and provides an explanation for, individual consciousness and the <i>plurality</i> of women's voices. Moreover, poststructuralism opens up the possibility of social change through language, as it comprehends language not as a passive medium for the expression of individual personality but, rather, as truly social and the site of struggle over meaning which is a prerequisite for political change. This possibility has significant implications
for a feminist analysis of freedom of expression. Indeed, it suggests the importance of freedom of expression to feminist politics and practice.
<p>
As in the case of liberal philosophy, poststructuralism is a label applied to a range of theoretical positions. Unlike other forms of poststructuralism, <i>feminist</i> poststructuralism is expressly concerned with the transformation of the hierarchical relationships of patriarchy. Weedon points out that &quot;most of the theorists who have produced poststructuralist texts are themselves unsympathetic to feminism. However it is important to distinguish between the political potential and usefulness of a theory and the particular affiliations of its author.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty4">44</a></sup> Weedon does not present her theory as an all-encompassing, universalized feminist
theory; she admits that it cannot address all the issues of concern to feminists. She also acknowledges that many feminists (most notably, radical and liberal feminists) have been critical of poststructuralism, as it decentres the rational unitary, autonomous subject of liberalism and the essential female nature that lies at the centre of much radical feminism. However, Weedon argues that the feminist poststructuralist perspective enables a recognition and
understanding of the different meanings feminists give to &quot;woman&quot; and &quot;femininity,&quot; and it provides a means of assessing &quot;the <i>practical</i> implications of particular ways of theorizing women's
oppression.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty5">45</a></sup>
<p>
To understand Weedon's poststructuralist theory and the role it envisions for language, it is first necessary to explain Saussure's structural linguistic theory of the &quot;sign&quot; on which poststructuralist theory builds but which it radically transforms. Saussure posited a theory of language in which language is a pre-given, fixed structure existing prior to its realization in speech or writing. He theorized language as an abstract system consisting of chains of signs. Each sign is made up of a &quot;signifier&quot; (a sound or written image) and a &quot;signified&quot; (a
meaning). For Saussure, there is no natural connection between the signifier and the signified. Each derives its meaning from its difference from all other signs in the language chain. For example, the signifier &quot;whore&quot; derives its meaning from its difference from other signifiers such as &quot;virgin&quot; and &quot;mother.&quot;
<p>
Poststructuralism takes from Saussure the idea that meaning is produced <i>within</i> language rather than reflected <i>by</i> language; individual signs have no fixed or intrinsic meaning but acquire meaning through the language chain. Poststructuralism sees human beings as connected through language, and meaning as constructed through human relationships. Furthermore, as language itself is always existing in historically specific discourses and social contexts, different languages and different discourses within the same language divide the world in a variety of ways and give it different meaning. The concept of &quot;discourse,&quot; as developed in the work of Foucault, refers to    
<blockquote>
. . . ways of constituting knowledge, together with the social practices, forms of subjectivity and power relations which inhere in such knowledges and the relations between them. Discourses are more than ways of thinking and producing meaning. They constitute the &quot;nature&quot; of the body, unconscious and conscious mind and emotional life of the subjects which they govern.<sup><a href="#forty6">46</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Meaning, then, is contingent and indeterminate. It is not fixed by an external reality that can be known objectively through Reason. As a result, meaning is not guaranteed by the subject who speaks or expresses herself but is open to plural interpretations. This conception of language and meaning clearly represents a fundamental critique of the view implicit in freedom of expression doctrine.
<p>
Although meaning is contingent and indeterminate, poststructuralism maintains that particular meanings do become
temporarily fixed or dominant. This is necessary for communication. It further asserts that power relations in society, including their manifestations in social institutions and practices, will influence <i>which</i> meanings do become temporarily fixed. Wheedon points out that:
<blockquote>
How we live our lives as conscious thinking subjects, and how we give meaning to the material social relations under which we live and which structure our everyday lives, depends on the range and social power of existing discourses, our access to them and the political strength of the interests which they represent.<sup><a href="#forty7">47</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Thus, the dominance of liberal assumptions in the judicial interpretation of the right to freedom of expression and the complicity of feminists in the maintenance of freedom of expression doctrine can be explained by the social power of liberalism in legal and political discourses. 
<p>
That particular meanings become dominant and temporarily fixed has implications for the notion of a &quot;truth&quot; to be found through the free clash of ideas, which is one of the articulated purposes of the right to freedom of expression. What appears as &quot;truth&quot; (as &quot;common sense,&quot; or as  &quot;natural&quot;) is merely the dominant meaning as defined by the most powerful discourses, and the &quot;clash of ideas&quot; is more akin to monopoly control than a free market-place. In Weedon's words: &quot;It is in making claims to truth that discourses demonstrate their inevitable conservatism, their investment in particular versions of meaning and their hostility to change.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty8">48</a></sup> Weedon further argues that &quot;truth is a social construct used to uphold patriarchal interests. . . .&quot;<sup><a href="#forty9">49</a></sup> This critique of the notion of truth has significant implications for feminist strategies. It is possible, Weedon notes, for feminists to assert new truths about women. Liberal feminists have taken this approach, arguing that women's physiology did not make them incapable of attaining an education or becoming successful in a career. Weedon believes, however, that such efforts are unlikely to succeed in transforming patriarchy. Once again, women's lack of resources and institutional bases for putting forth alternative claims to truth stand in the way of making &quot;much impact on the discursive hierarchy of existing writing and research, backed, as it is, by capitalist and patriarchal interests.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty">50</a></sup>
<p>
While language enables us to think, speak, and give meaning to the world, it is also the place where our sense of self, our <i>subjectivity</i>, is constructed. &quot;Subjectivity&quot; refers to &quot;the conscious and unconcious thoughts and emotions of the individual, her sense of herself and her ways of understanding her relation to the world.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty1">51</a></sup> In contrast to the liberal assumption of an &quot;essence at the heart of the individual which is unique, fixed and coherent and which makes her what she
is,&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty2">52</a></sup> poststructuralism <i>decentres</i> the subject. It asserts that subjectivity is constituted through relationships---through language and a range of competing discourses. In the face of competing and often contradictory discourses, human subjectivity is neither unified nor rational. Rather, it is the site of disunity and conflict---the site of struggle over meaning. The self, then, is open to continuous redefinition. From this perspective, gender identities are not essential, and particular versions of femininity and masculinity are never inevitable. The claim that individual subjectivity is socially constructed does not deny individual agency. As Weedon explains,
<blockquote>
. . . [L]anguage, in the form of socially and historically specific discourses, cannot have any social and political effectivity except in and through the actions of the individuals who become its bearers by taking up the forms of subjectivity and the meanings and values which it proposes and acting upon them. The individual is both the site for a range of possible forms of subjectivity and, at any particular moment of thought or speech, a subject, subjected to
the regime of meaning of a particular discourse and enabled to act accordingly. The position of subject from which language is articulated, from which speech, acts, thoughts or writing appear to originate, is integral to the structure of language and, by extension, to the structure of conscious subjectivity which it constitutes.<sup><a href="#fifty3">53</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Discourses are seen to offer each of us a variety of &quot;subject positions&quot; through which we can consciously live our lives. For example, women are offered a range of competing subject positions: career woman, pornographic sexual object, successful wife and mother. Subject positions are constructed through the media and through all our social institutions, including law. Again, the power of subject positions depends on the power of the discourses that construct them, on the individual's access to them, and on the material circumstances of each individual's life. In a patriarchal society, discourses and subject positions that maintain gender inequality are most powerful, while feminist discourses---and the alternative subject positions they offer women---are marginalized and devalued.
<p>
A recognition of the social power of particular subject positions for women, such as sexual object and wife/mother, helps to explain women's <i>complicity</i> in their own oppression. In social debates about the issue of pornography, the question of why women &quot;willingly&quot; pose for pornographic magazines or appear in pornographic films has presented feminism with a difficult challenge. If women &quot;willingly&quot; do so, how is it that pornography oppresses women? Are these women simply &quot;wrong&quot; in their failure to comprehend their oppression? Weedon notes that liberal feminism, &quot;with its belief in the sovereignty of the individual, is unable to deal satisfactorily with the question of `complicity with oppression.'  If a woman's choice is based on her free will then it must be valid.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty4">54</a></sup> Thus, &quot;the structural and institutional oppression of women disappears behind the belief that if I as rational sovereign subject freely choose my way of life on the basis of my individual rational consciousness which gives me knowledge of the world, then I am not oppressed.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty5">55</a></sup> Feminist poststructuralism implicates language, meaning, and patriarchal discourses in women's oppression; these are internalized by the individual woman in the form of subject positions through which she lives her life and reflects upon it.
<p>
Discourses, located in social institutions and processes, are constantly competing with one another for the allegiance of individual agents. The political and social interests of a discourse cannot be realized without the agency of individuals who are subjectively motivated to either reproduce or transform social practices and relationships of power. As a result, the subject positions constructed by discourses are &quot;part of the battle to determine the day to day practices of family life.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty6">56</a></sup> They are &quot;central to the process of political change and to preserving the status quo.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty7">57</a></sup> In this way, language and its expression are inseparable from human action. When our actions are manifestations of socially constructed subject positions, when they reinforce one discourse or another, they do have <i>meaning</i> even when they appear not to. For example, the rape of a woman by a man and other acts of violence against women
are not merely physical acts; they convey a meaning of male dominance. Thus, the separation of speech and action urged by the assumptions of autonomy and Reason becomes illusory. It was noted earlier that Canadian freedom of expression jurisprudence has not maintained such a radical dichotomy between expression and action. However, the alternative distinction between form and content is also problematic. The concept of &quot;form&quot; contains within it the separation of expression and action. Some actions are intended to convey meaning while others are not. The alternative theory of meaning outlined above suggests that meaning, expression, and action cannot be isolated from one another without ignoring the social construction of subjectivity and, moreover, the power relations that
underpin particular subjectivities.
<p>
Poststructuralism regards language as &quot;the place where actual and possible forms of social organization and their likely social and political consequences are defined and contested.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty8">58</a></sup> Meanings can never be permanently fixed. Being contingent and indeterminate, they are always open to challenge and redefinition. This opens up possibilities for change:
<blockquote>
Once language is understood in terms of competing discourses, competing ways of giving meaning to the world, which imply differences in the organization of social power, then language becomes an important site of political struggle.<sup><a href="#fifty9">59</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The poststructuralist conception of power is also important for effecting change. Power 
<blockquote>
. . . is a relation. It inheres in difference and is a dynamic of control and lack of control between discourses and the
subjects, constituted by discourses, who are their agents. Power is exercised within discourses in the ways in which they constitute and govern individual subjects.<sup><a href="#sixty">60</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Moreover, power is seen to be &quot;polymorphous&quot;; it eludes the total control of any group or body and thus never flows in only one direction. Recognizing the multiplicity of power relations is crucial to feminist analysis and practice, as it opens up a whole range of points of resistance.
<p>
Despite the ongoing battle for the subjectivity of each individual---&quot;a battle in which real interests are at stake, for example, gender-based social power&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty1">61</a></sup> ---dominant, liberal assumptions about the nature of subjectivity and language obscure this power struggle. The liberal tradition suggests that each individual possesses an unchanging essence of subjectivity:
<blockquote>
Consciousness is thought to be a continuous stream rather than the fragmented and contradictory effect of a discursive battle for the subjectivity of the individual. The exclusiveness of the assumption of a particular form of subjectivity, which rules out its alternatives, together with the individual subject's misrecognition of herself as the true author of her thoughts, speech and writing, gives the articulation of subjectivity in language the temporary
appearance of fixity. This sense of fixity seems to rule out change.<sup><a href="#sixty2">62</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Thus, the liberal assumptions underpinning freedom of expression doctrine are implicated in patriarchal discourses that assert their own truth, mask the power of language, and deny the crucial role of language in effecting social change. In short, they serve to preserve the status quo of patriarchy.
<p>
It has been argued that the core purposes that have framed the doctrinal interpretation of the right to freedom of expression rest on a set of assumptions that are inadequate for understanding the crucial relationships among the individual, society, and expression. Furthermore, the assumptions are gendered and, as such, implicate the relations and discourses of patriarchy. One consequence of failing to examine these assumptions critically is that the power relations of patriarchy are masked and silently reproduced. Another is that issues such as pornography become distorted when seen through a lens that portrays language as a passive medium for the expression of innate and essential personality. In particular, a recognition and understanding of the complexity of the harm resulting from
pornography remains elusive when the pornographic message is viewed from a perspective that understands the world in terms of autonomy, rationality, truth, and equality of expression. Indeed, the meaning of &quot;harm&quot; in legal doctrine has been constructed by a discourse that sees language and expression as external to the individual rather than constitutive of individual subjectivity.
<p>
In her writings on the issue of pornography, Catherine MacKinnon has argued that &quot;the issue is not whether pornography is harmful, but how the harm of pornography is to become visible.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty3">63</a></sup> The following section will examine the question of the harm resulting from pornography and suggest that the alternative view of expression and individual subjectivity outlined above provides a way of making this harm &quot;visible.&quot;
<p>
<h3>Conceptualizing Harm: The Feminist Struggle Over the Meaning of Pornography</h3>

Within feminism, there has been much debate about whether or not pornography &quot;causes harm&quot; to women, men, and society. The debate can be seen as part of a discursive struggle over the meaning of pornography and harm, with particular meanings having specific political/practical consequences. The issue of harm has been a
contentious one, at least in part because the question of a causal link between the viewing of pornography by men and actual violence against women has remained &quot;unresolved.&quot; Another reason for the contention is the failure of many feminists to acknowledge expressly that their various positions on the issue are premised on quite
different assumptions about expression, language, and individual subjectivity. As a result, much of the &quot;debate&quot; has been little more than a lot of people talking past one another.
<p>
The characterization of harm has been central to defining the right to freedom of expression, as only that speech that causes harm has been deemed to be subject to restraint. There are at least three distinct arguments made about the relationship between pornography and harm. While these are by no means monolithic or exhaustive, they provide a useful way to structure the debate in order to describe and analyse it. One view, often expressed by feminists who accept the world view of liberal philosophy, is that pornography---understood as &quot;mere words and images&quot;---cannot cause harm; while sticks and stones may break my bones, names will never hurt me. This view suggests that the violent and degrading images expressed in pornography are either benign or beneficial. The latter characterization is premised on the idea that pornography allows men to fantasize about their impulses without having to act them out. Another view asserts that men <i>learn</i> from the images they see and the messages they receive. They learn that violence against women is acceptable and is part of what it means to be a &quot;man.&quot; Furthermore, through watching repeated violence, men come to be <i>desensitized</i> to violence. A third view, typically expressed by so-called radical feminists, tells us that pornography, in the context of a patriarchal society, plays a central role in the construction of gender identities and sexuality in such a way as to
institutionalize inequality, domination, and violence.
<p>
As noted, each of these views is premised on different assumptions about the relationship between expression and
subjectivity. The first view reflects the understanding of language, meaning, and subjectivity that is implicated in the assumptions of autonomy, rationality, and truth. It reflects the traditional liberal conceptualization of language as a passive medium existing apart from the individual, as well as the liberal understanding of harm as being either physical or in some way external to the individual. This meaning of harm is derived from the central value of liberty or negative freedom. &quot;The individual is free to the extent that she is not restrained by external forces, primarily viewed as law, physical force, and other overt coercion.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty4">64</a></sup> Restraint is understood as restraint <i>by</i> others who then threaten an individual's <i>inherent</i> freedom. The individual <i>cannot</i> be restrained by &quot;internal&quot; forces, because her &quot;mind is her own.&quot; A distinction, then, is drawn between expression and action. This distinction is premised on the belief that speech is less immediate and more remediable than action; it is generally not a threat to individual liberty. On the basis of the expression-action dichotomy, a further distinction is drawn between <i>individual</i> and <i>group</i> harms. As Emerson argues,
<blockquote>
. . . [T]he harm to the individual interest is more likely to be direct and immediate in its impact, and irremediable by resource to regulation of the subsequent conduct stimulated by the expression. For this reason communication injuring an individual interest is more readily classifiable as &quot;action&quot; than injury to the general social
interest which is capable of protection by control of subsequent overt acts.<sup><a href="#sixty5">65</a></sup>
</blockquote>
In the case of civil libel and slander, which injure <i>individual</i> business, professional or other property <i>interests,</i> the harm does not flow from any action resulting from the communication. Rather, it flows directly from the communication itself. It is on this basis that the harm of civil libel and slander are distinguished from the harm of pornography, which is understood in terms of any <i>subsequent action</i> caused by the expression. According to this view, only that pornography which directly incites a man to physical violence or coercion would be seen to &quot;cause harm.&quot; Significantly, this requirement of a causal nexus can be satisfied only by looking at <i>individual</i> cases <i>after</i> the unlawful action has occurred. Moreover, this approach does not provide a rationale for prohibiting pornography in general.
<p>
The second view of the harm that results from pornography focuses largely on men and their responses to pornographic messages. This approach moves away from the individualistic conception of harm and considers <i>men</i> as a group who cause harm, and <i>women</i> as a group who are the victims of such harm. It suggests that men &quot;learn&quot; from pornography; they learn that violence and degradation are acceptable and that women desire to be treated in this way. In turn, men are seen to act on what they have learned to be true.
Those who take this view are also looking for an identifiable and objectively knowable causal link between pornography and harm to women, but here the causal link is between pornography and men's <i>attitudes</i> which, in turn, are acted on. Attitudinal change becomes the crucial link between the message and the action. Much of the social scientific research conducted on the impact of pornography reflects this understanding of the relationship between pornography and harm. However, the results of the various studies have been ambiguous as not <i>all</i> men have shown negative attitudinal responses to pornographic imagery.
<p>
While at first glance this second view of harm appears to break down the assumptions of autonomy and rationality, a closer look suggests that these values continue to be held out as ideals. Some proponents of this conception of harm argue that negative attitudes can be changed by the same process through which they are formed, that is, through education and learning. The suggestion appears to be that because the pornographic message is a <i>false</i> one, the truth can emerge if rational people are informed of it. Also, by continuing to assert the requirement, and hence the potential existence, of a causal relationship between pornography and actual violence as mediated by attitude, this view is not really different from that expressed by Emerson in his lament that the human mind, while having the capacity for Reason, is subject to prejudice and misinformation. The second approach sustains a view of language as external to individuals by implying (through the assumption of a cause-effect relationship) the separation of expression, attitude, and action into discrete stages of a causal chain. This separation
is underscored by the fact that <i>physical violence</i> remains the ultimate definition of harm. There is also an assumption here of an essential and unified subjectivity. That is, there is an assumption that men's minds work alike and that all men, or at least most, will respond to pornography in the same way. Similarly, it is assumed that all women are victims of the pornographic message. This also suggests that pornography is seen as having a single, fixed meaning.
<p>
In its decision in <cite>Butler</cite>, the Supreme Court of Canada adopted the second view of harm. In its consideration of the constitutionality of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> provisions dealing with obscene material, the Court first found that pornography constituted expression. It then held that the promotion of  &quot;morality&quot; was not a valid reason to prohibit such expression in the face of the <cite>Charter</cite> guarantee of freedom of expression. However, the &quot;prevention of harm to society&quot; was deemed to be a valid reason. This conclusion reflects the traditional liberal position that expression must be restricted only for the purpose of preventing harm. However, the claim that this harm is not only to individuals but also to <i>society</i>, represents a move away from the assumptions underpinning the purposes of freedom of expression. In order to uphold the impugned legislation, then, the Court had to show what this social harm was and how it came about. In his decision for the majority, Sopinka J. struggled to find a causal connection between the pornographic message and harm to both women as a group and society in general. In his struggle, he shifted between various characterizations of the harm and the nature of the connection, resulting in a troublesome and unpersuasive judgment.
<p>
The dominant view of harm reflected in the decision is that pornography causes attitudinal changes that then lead to actual violence. Sopinka J. cited Wilson J. in <cite>R. v. Town Cinema Theatres Ltd.</cite>,<sup><a href="#sixty6">66</a></sup> who noted that &quot;[t]he public has concluded that exposure to material that degrades the human dimensions of life to a subhuman or merely physical dimension and thereby contributes to a process of <i>moral desensitization</i> must be harmful in some way [emphasis added].&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty7">67</a></sup> Later, it was suggested that harm &quot;means that it <i>predisposes persons to act in an antisocial manner,</i> as for example, the physical or mental mistreatment of women by men [emphasis added].&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty8">68</a></sup> In characterizing the objectives of the impugned legislation, Sopinka J. asserted that the purpose of s. 163 of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> is &quot;the avoidance of harm resulting from the <i>antisocial attitudinal changes</i> that exposure to obscene material causes [emphasis added].&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty9">69</a></sup>
<p>
This emphasis on <i>changes</i> in men's attitudes is problematic for a number of reasons. First, it fails to recognize <i>existing</i> attitudes of sexism and discrimination against women. In turn, it isolates pornography and directs attention away from the myriad of other patriarchal discourses that (re)create women's inequality. It is interesting that Sopinka J. actually did refer to the problem of existing attitudes when he cited the <cite>MacGuigan
Report</cite> which found that &quot;[t]he clear and unquestionable danger of this type of material [pornography] is that it <i>reinforces</i> some unhealthy tendencies in Canadian society. The effect of this material is to <i>reinforce male-female stereotypes</i> to the detriment of both sexes [emphasis added].&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy">70</a></sup> However, he did not pursue the implications of this view. Thus, while the <cite>Butler</cite> decision appears to be a victory for women in its recognition that pornography results in harm to women as a group and threatens the feminist goal of ending women's oppression, the extent of that recognition may be only skin-deep. Indeed, at only one point did Sopinka J. expressly suggest that there is a &quot;threat to equality&quot; from audience exposure to certain types of violent and degrading material.<sup><a href="#seventy1">71</a></sup>
<p>
A second difficulty arising from the focus on attitudinal change is that, while some studies have found a link between exposure to pornography and a change in how some men view women, the results typically have been inconclusive. This fact led Sopinka J. to adopt an ambiguous, if not contradictory, position on the question of
causation. In his application of the rational connection test under the s. 1 analysis, he found that &quot;the rational link between s. 163 and the objective of Parliament relates to the <i>actual causal relationship</i> between obscenity and the risk of harm to society at large [emphasis added].&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy2">72</a></sup> However, he went on to note that &quot;a direct link between obscenity and harm to society may be difficult, if not impossible, to establish.&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy3">73</a></sup> In the end Sopinka J. resorted to Reason: &quot;[I]t is reasonable to presume that exposure to images bears a causal relationship to changes in attitudes and beliefs.&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy4">74</a></sup> While the causation of antisocial attitudinal changes has not been <i>proven</i>, the further link to actual violence and discriminatory behaviour---the crucial link---has been even more elusive. Again, Sopinka J. finally relied on the &quot;underlying logic&quot; of the conclusion that exposure to violent material bears a causal relationship to acts of sexual violence.<sup><a href="#seventy5">75</a></sup> This &quot;common sense&quot; or &quot;rational&quot; approach to the questions of <i>if</i> and <i>how</i> pornography harms women and society is hardly satisfactory. Indeed, it dodges the issue. Furthermore, if what constitutes logic, common sense, and reason is determined by the relative power of competing discourses and the temporary fixing of particular meanings given to experience, then the reliance on logic becomes an act of support for the status quo. 
<p>
There are at least two further difficulties associated with the Court's search for a causal nexus between pornography and men's attitudes and behaviours toward women. The first is that the Court's reliance on the <i>reasonableness</i> and <i>logic</i> of the causal link breaks down any distinction between pornography and other violent and degrading depictions of women and men. What about popular films that show women being raped, abused, and murdered? Do these not cause &quot;harm&quot;? Why draw the line at pornography? Is there a principled distinction here? This is an important issue, but the Court, in its confusing decision, does not even acknowledge it. The final problem is the <i>exclusion of women.</i> While the Court seemed to acknowledge that pornography is a feminist issue, it maintained the traditional focus on <i>men.</i> Thus, most of the discussion of harm in <cite>Butler</cite> was concerned with the impact of pornography on men's attitudes and behaviour. However, Sopinka J. did note in passing that &quot;materials portraying women as a class of objects for sexual exploitation and abuse have a negative impact on the individual's sense of self-worth and  acceptance.&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy6">76</a></sup> Nothing more was said about this. 
<p>
While the <cite>Butler</cite> decision was hailed by many feminists as a victory for women's equality, there are enough ambiguities and problems in the decision to warrant more suspicion than glee. For feminists, it is significant that the Supreme Court did not provide an adequate explanation of the extent and complexity of the harm to women resulting from pornography; it did not make the harm &quot;visible.&quot; What the Court did not consider was the third view of the harm, according to which pornography plays a constitutive role in the social construction of men's and women's subjectivities. Importantly, the Court could not easily have adopted such a view in light of the assumptions about the nature of language and expression underpinning its definition of the right to freedom of expression. Yet, I would like to argue that it is from this vantage point that the complexity and depth of pornography's harm can be made &quot;visible.&quot; 
<p>
The third view of harm characterizes pornography as a constitutive discourse that, although its meaning is not inherent, is given power and specific meaning within the context of a larger patriarchal system of discourses and the material experience of oppression and large-scale violence against women. It is part of the political struggle over the meaning of &quot;woman,&quot; &quot;man,&quot; and &quot;sexuality,&quot; and the relationship between these social constructs. In this way, the &quot;harm&quot; is not so much that we <i>learn</i> from pornography. Rather, the harm is the role pornography plays in the construction of powerful subject positions through which both men and women consciously live their lives, as well as its role in (re)creating and reinforcing the dominance of patriarchal discourses and their manifestations in institutions and social structures. This harm affects both individual women and women as a group.
<p>
In pornography, women are constructed as subordinate objects who enjoy being degraded and brutalized; men are constructed as dominant, aggressive, and the possessors of women for their own pleasure; sexuality is constructed in terms of asymmetrical power, violence, and exploitation. The social debate surrounding pornography has added to these the further subject positions of women as &quot;victims&quot; and men as the &quot;perpetrators&quot; of violence. As powerful subject positions, these constructions are incorporated into who we are---our subjectivities---and they thereby shape what we do, what we believe, and who we become. Constitutive of our identities, they influence our attitudes and behaviours in a way that cannot be reduced to causation. A further harm is that the pornographic message---which is in no way confined to what we label as &quot;pornography&quot;---is so
powerful, so dominant in our culture, that it has been accepted as somehow &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;true.&quot; Parading as truth, it has stifled the imaginations of both women and men to develop alternative
meanings and new subject positions through which we might live and think about our lives. Moreover, the dominant liberal discourse on the nature of language and the role of expression denies that such transformations and alternatives are even possible.
<p>
It is in <i>all</i> of these ways that pornography can be seen to &quot;silence&quot; and &quot;harm&quot; women.
<p>
This third view has been confused and distorted in the claims made by some feminist scholars who appear to have adopted it. Most notably, Catherine MacKinnon has asserted both that gender identities are socially constructed and that pornography plays a central role in the constitution of these identities.<sup><a href="#seventy7">77</a></sup> However, she has not made explicit the alternative theory of language on which her arguments rest, and this failure has served to undermine the cogency and coherence of her arguments. Indeed, she has continued to use the term &quot;causation&quot; to describe the link between pornography and attitudes of behaviour and violence,<sup><a href="#seventy8">78</a></sup> although she criticizes the particular form of
linear causation underpinning legal reasoning.<sup><a href="#seventy9">79</a></sup>
<p>
MacKinnon has argued that pornography &quot;<i>is</i> a form of forced sex, a practice of sexual politics, an institution of gender inequality [emphasis added].&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty">80</a></sup> For her,
pornography has one meaning---a fixed meaning. More generally, she writes in terms of monolithic and unified meanings and identities, making bold assertions about &quot;men,&quot; &quot;women's experience,&quot; and &quot;the feminist perspective.&quot; What MacKinnon has not acknowledged is that identities that are socially constituted are neither unified nor rational, and that pornography, understood as a discourse, has no inherent meaning but, rather, is contingent and indeterminate. Indeed, not every man and woman is affected by pornography in the same way, as individuals are influenced differently by the relative power of discourses in their lives, by their access to alternative subject positions, and by their material circumstances which give authority to particular discourses and subject positions. Some women describe their experience of pornography as &quot;liberating,&quot; although others have been forced to act out violent and degrading scenes from pornographic films; some men resist its oppressive and sexist meaning, while others accept its message of male dominance.
<p>
It has been argued here that pornography does harm women as a group and it does harm some individual women, although not every woman and man is influenced by its message in the same way. The harm is not a physical and observable harm, but one that works from within by constituting our subjectivities. Through the construction of
powerful subject positions that define men as dominant and women as the objects of male pleasure, pornography works to reinforce the discourses and institutions of patriarchy. This harm has been made invisible by the dominant understanding of language, meaning, and expression which underpins the Supreme Court's definitions of freedom
of expression and harm.
<p>
Although pornography's harm has been made visible, it does not necessarily follow that the appropriate response to such harm is <i>censorship.</i> In the next section, I will consider the implications of characterizing pornography as a constitutive discourse for the debate within feminism about whether or not pornography should be legally prohibited---that is, censored.
<p>
<h3>A Feminist Poststructuralist Re-Thinking of the Censorship Debate</h3>

There is no single feminist voice on the meaning of pornography and, in turn, no single approach to what, if anything, should be done about it. The debate about how feminism should respond to pornography has focused mainly on the issue of censorship---that is, on whether or not pornography should be prohibited by legislation. Feminist perspectives on censorship are related to the various characterizations of harm, to the assumptions made about individuals and the nature of expression that underpin them, and to the meanings of the right to freedom of expression that these assumptions implicate. Thus, feminist opinion on censorship ranges from the belief that pornography is central to women's oppression and, given the inequality of freedom of expression, it must be subject to state control; through the understanding that pornography is against women's interests and must be campaigned
against without relying on the patriarchal state for protection; to a claim that pornography is merely representation and, unlike acts, cannot cause oppression and therefore does not constitute a valid reason for restricting expression. In light of the preceding discussion of the very real harms of pornography, the latter view must be seen as highly problematic and difficult to sustain. Moreover, as it is based on a set of assumptions that are fundamentally gendered, it is itself implicated in patriarchal discourses and structures. I will examine the first and second opinions in more detail, as they encompass much of the feminist debate, considering the strengths and weaknesses of each from the perspective set out above---that pornography is a constitutive discourse, and, as it has no inherent or fixed meaning, its influence on individual men and women is contingent.
<p>
The first opinion is typically associated with Catherine MacKinnon. As has been noted, she begins from the premise that pornography, as a form of sexual violence, is <i>central</i> to the institutionalization of patriarchy, which she sees as an all-embracing structure of misogyny. Moreover, MacKinnon asserts that we live in a &quot;pornographic culture,&quot; wherein the particular messages of pornography continuously spill over into mass culture, making degradation and violence against women the cultural norm. The right to freedom of expression, framed as it is in negative terms, is also understood as a constituent part of patriarchal power relations, as its assumption of equality of voice ignores the fact that women are not equal to men in their power to express their views and ideas. MacKinnon concludes that pornography must be censored.<sup><a href="#eighty1">81</a></sup>
<p>
Rather than starting with a focus on pornography, the second approach begins 
<blockquote>
. . . from the premise that feminism is a form of dissent which threatens a power structure based on male authority, male privilege, and male status. The patriarchal state can tolerate small equity reforms and adjustments advocated by feminists but, as the pressures for social change escalate, what feminists have most to fear is the censorship of themselves.<sup><a href="#eighty2">82</a></sup>
</blockquote>
From this perspective pornography is seen as only one of the many ways in which women are harmed by patriarchy, and the ultimate goal of liberating women from male dominance requires that the right to freedom of expression be supported by tolerating pornography and renouncing censorship.
<p>
Neither of these views is complete, and both rely on problematic assumptions. Furthermore, neither offers a full exploration of the <i>political implications</i> of the arguments asserted. First of all, the first view omits the insights of the second. The advocacy of censorship both neglects to discuss the importance of freedom of expression to feminist causes and fails to distinguish convincingly between pornography and the myriad of other patriarchal discourses that constitute and structure women's inequality. Some feminist authors, such as Naomi Wolf, have suggested that the imagery and meanings of &quot;soft porn,&quot; such as those found in <cite>Playboy</cite>, as well as the subject positions offered by women's magazines, advertising, and romance novels, are even more powerful in their influence on how women consciously live their lives.<sup><a href="#eighty3">83</a></sup> Because their oppressive meanings are less obvious, they are all the more insidious. If the exercise of power is located in language and meaning, and much of the harm resulting from pornography is the constitution of identities and subjectivities that reinforce male dominance, then drawing the line at pornography becomes problematic and somewhat arbitrary. Furthermore, as explicit sex remains the distinguishing feature of pornography, the dark shadow of &quot;social morality&quot; looms too close for comfort.
<p>
MacKinnon's approach is also problematic because it is grounded on an understanding of both patriarchy and pornography as monolithic and deterministic discourses and structures. In turn, she has unified and universalized their influence; all women become merely victims, and all men are deemed oppressors. In MacKinnon's work there seems to be &quot;an implicit assumption that somewhere and somehow there exists an unchanging and predefined female sexuality which is: romantic, egalitarian, natural, gentle, free of power dynamics, monogamous, emotional, nurturing and spontaneous.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty4">84</a></sup> Also implicit is a view of men &quot;who have no self-reflection and whose engagement with the cultural complex is completely passive and
unselective.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty5">85</a></sup> As discussed above, this reductionism fails to take into
account the varying and contingent influence of pornography and patriarchy. Furthermore, it perpetuates and further fixes the dominant meanings of pornography, femininity, and masculinity---meanings that MacKinnon asserts are a cause of women's oppression. It is significant that the censorship of pornography further entrenches and institutionalizes these meanings in legal discourse, both in legislation and in judicial decisions. The <cite>Butler</cite> decision provides a telling example of this process.
<p>
MacKinnon's monolithic categories, then, are exclusive. Women who do not feel oppressed by pornography, or who experience it as liberating, are deemed once again to be &quot;victims,&quot; but this time of a false consciousness. Furthermore, in addressing the campaign against pornography from a supposedly united female subjectivity, MacKinnon assumes that women are oppressed first and foremost by a universal patriarchy, unmediated by race, class, sexual orientation, or history. Her premises do not allow for an analysis of how other modes of oppression intersect with gender in the discourse of pornography. For Black women, who historically have been constructed
as more primitive and more sexual, there is an important racial dimension in pornography that stereotypes Black female sexuality in images received by white men and women.<sup><a href="#eighty6">86</a></sup> For lesbians, who have had their erotica expropriated by hostile law enforcers, censorship and any definition of pornography for legislative purposes is replete with dangers.
<p>
The important point here is that any advocacy of censorship, whether through criminal legislation or civil legislation (as in the Minneapolis Ordinances authored by MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin), denies and represses the disunity within feminism and among women on the meaning of pornography. It also fails to consider the political alliances that are implicated by reliance on legislation. Conservative groups can agree with feminists that pornography degrades and harms women because, for them, women's sexuality outside the family is itself seen as cheapened and degraded. Thus, while legislation might be enacted that seems clear on its face, the indeterminacy of <i>its</i> meaning raises the question of who has the ultimate power to determine its meaning. Who will interpret the legislation? Who will enforce it? As Lisa Duggan has argued, &quot;[I]t is the alignment of political and cultural forces that gives meaning to issues and laws.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty7">87</a></sup> A feminist law of censorship, once enacted, is subject to these influences. Thus, restrictive laws must be approached with caution.
<p>
The second view of pornography and censorship, which emphasizes the need for freedom of expression, is rendered problematic by the failure to grapple with the power relations structured by freedom of expression as it has been interpreted by the courts. There is little if any recognition of women's unequal voice and the ways in which pornography and other patriarchal discourses &quot;silence&quot; women. There is little discussion of how a negative right to freedom of expression maintains existing power relations between, on the one hand, those who do have free expression and, on the other, those who do not because their subjectivities have been shaped in ways that
support the status quo, and because they have little socio-economic power to assert their opinions in the &quot;market-place of ideas.&quot; Indeed, by advocating freedom of expression without a critical analysis of the assumptions that are thereby reproduced, feminists who adopt this view, while ultimately seeking to liberate women, may be subverting this goal by their reliance on a set of assumptions that are gendered and that do not allow the harms of pornography and other discourses to be adequately understood. This approach, which implicitly accepts the theory of language underpinning freedom of expression doctrine, can comprehend the harm of pornography only in terms of causation; it cannot begin to see the constitutive nature of its message, the indeterminacy of its meaning, and its influence on women as an oppressed group.
<p>
I would like to suggest that the emphasis on the question of censorship has resulted in a static and often polarized debate. In part, this is the result of the failure by advocates of both positions---pro-censorship and anti-censorship---to take seriously the political-strategic implications of their views. Moreover, it is the result of a failure to assess critically the right to freedom of expression itself, particularly the view of language and of the individual that defines its doctrinal purposes and limits. What neither approach offers is the possibility of breaking out of this bounded debate---the possibility of meaningful alternatives. Neither, through the assumptions they implicitly or explicitly accept, provides for the possibility and means of effective resistance. MacKinnon's view closes off the possibility of resistance by conceptualizing both pornography and patriarchy as a unified all-encompassing discursive structure, and by defining all women as victims and all men as perpetrators. As victims of this monolithic
structure, what can women possibly do to challenge pornography, other than turn to the state for protection? For advocates of freedom of expression, resistance means &quot;more speech&quot;---countering the falsehoods of pornography with truths about women so that men of Reason will change their attitudes and behaviours toward women. This position neglects women's structural and material inequality, thereby avoiding the very real problem of women's lack of access to the institutions and the resources necessary to generate powerful alternatives. That pornography is simply false and that there exists some &quot;truth&quot; about women's sexuality is a claim that has been shown to be illusory. Furthermore, the reliance on Reason is both illusory and gendered. Indeed, by accepting the view of language implicated in the right to freedom of expression, these feminists deny that pornography might be indeterminate and contingent in its meaning. They locate the problem of political change in the nature of the separate (autonomous) individual herself, in her self-knowledge, and in her struggle to find her true nature, rather than in language and social relationships.
<p>
It is in the indeterminacy of meaning---that is, in the understanding that language is not unified, fixed, and external, but a site of political struggle over meaning---that the key to resistance lies. It is from this vantage point that feminists can begin to articulate alternative meanings of both the pornographic message and the right to freedom of expression, meanings that will promote women's liberation from patriarchal oppression.
<p>
Robin West has adopted the view that pornography is indeterminate in its meaning, and she has sought to draw out some of the possible implications of this indeterminacy.<sup><a href="#eighty8">88</a></sup> She suggests that pornography engenders contradictory meanings for women. On the one hand, it presents a threat of violence which is supported by women's material experience in our society. On the other, it offers the promise of pleasure. Both the threat and the promise are made simultaneously. The dominant meaning of pornography depends on who is looking at it. Thus, some women will experience pornography as liberating, while others will find it harmful. West further suggests that it is through this contradiction that the power of pornography, and the hierarchies it reinforces, are maintained. The promise of pornography serves to legitimate the inequality of power that it helps to structure by constructing the female self and sexuality as finding pleasure in violence; the threat serves as an instrument of patriarchal power. Both the threat and the promise work within a belief system that tells women <i>at the same time</i> that words and images cannot cause harm and that pornography does indeed lead to violence. Again, the message is contradictory.
<p>
For West, this contradiction presents women with the opportunity to transform the meaning of pornography. Women, she argues, can seize upon the liberating promise of pleasure and rewrite the meaning of those constructs that pornography attempts to fix---rewrite them in such a way as to ensure compliance with the promise. It is
acknowledged, however, that this is no easy task, as the dominance of pornography has constrained both women's and men's imagination of alternative discourses on sexuality and gender identity. She suggests that one way to struggle against the dominance is to fight the meanings pornography constructs,
<blockquote>
. . . but another way is by fighting the dominance of the pornographic imagination. We do the latter by ending our own silence. We fight the dominance of the pornographic imagination in the same way we fight the dominance of other forms of legal ideology---by understanding its content, its history, its source, and its contingency in our lives, and then by exercising our censored, suppressed and silenced imagination, by generating our own sexual imagery, by becoming our own sexual authority, and thereby repossessing our own sexual world.<sup><a href="#eighty9">89</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Chris Weedon has made a similar argument. She suggests that one of the important ways in which power is exercised is through language and meaning, and, in turn, through the constitution of subjectivity within discourse and the production of social agents. By recognizing language, meaning, and subjectivity as important ways of exercising power, women can begin to resist particular subject positions. However, like West, she argues that resistance must take place from an alternative subject position. What is needed is alternative subjectivities and discourses on women's---and men's---sexualities. Yet, largely preoccupied with the pornography and censorship debate, feminists have effectively reproduced the dominance of pornography while neglecting to imagine <i>who else</i> men and women might be and become. Many of those who advocate censorship seem to have assumed that once the pornographic message is locked away, women will be free to express their own meanings. This belief stems from an assumption that women have some essential feminine sexuality. If, on the other hand, one believes that individuals have no inherent nature and their experience has no pre-given meaning, change will not come about without women having access to alternative discourses and subjectivities. Merely telling women and men that pornography is false does not provide such alternatives.<sup><a href="#ninety">90</a></sup> Indeed, the discourse on pornography needs to be refocused---it needs to move away from the sterile debate about censorship versus freedom of expression to consider the actual and possible sexualities and identities of women <i>in all their variety.</i>
<p>
These arguments suggest several important implications for the debate about what to do about pornography. The first is that censorship alone is passive, negative, and unconstructive. As such, it does not allow women to exercise power. Rather, it places them in the protective hands of the patriarchal state. The second is, as Weedon points out, that the most powerful discourses have firm material and institutional bases. Change at the subjective level of consciousness is limited by material relationships and practices. This suggests that women are not silenced by pornography alone, but also by an institutional structure and a media system that exclude them. The strategy of resistance through alternative discourses is rendered problematic by women's lack of access to the means of having
these alternatives heard.
<p>
Women, then, are confronted with an apparently fundamental dilemma. On the one hand, pornography and patriarchy are open to resistance through language and expression; on the other hand, women do not have the material bases for asserting powerful discourses of resistance. I would like to suggest that the alternative
conceptualizations of language, expression, and the individual presented here provide a possible way out of this dilemma---through a transformation of the meaning of the right to freedom of expression itself. As in the case of autonomy, freedom of expression is a value that is important to feminism, as women struggle to change meanings
and develop alternative discourses. In Weedon's words: &quot;In rewriting the meaning of the feminine or of `femaleness,' feminists make language the site of a struggle over meaning which is a prerequisite for political change.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety1">91</a></sup> Censorship or any other restrictions on the right to freedom of expression only serve to limit the right and stand at odds with an effort to expand the right to be more inclusive of women.
<p>
What women need as they struggle for liberation is a <i>positive right</i> to free expression, a right that will empower them to demand access to the means of expression and permit them to voice alternative meanings and subject positions. In articulating such a positive right, we must redefine the purposes of the right to freedom of expression, rejecting their current incarnations and formulating them in light of the alternative view of human expression set out above. Framed as a negative right, freedom of expression serves the interests of the already powerful. Furthermore, by re-creating a particular set of assumptions about expression and the individual, the dominant meaning of freedom of expression obscures the power relations that it helps to structure and masks the harms in which patriarchal discourses---including pornography---result. In the next section, I will suggest what a (re)visioned right to freedom of expression might begin to look like.
<p>
<h3>Towards a (Re)Vision of the Right to Freedom of Expression</h3>

It has been argued that the doctrinal purposes of freedom of expression are premised on a set of assumptions about individuals, language, and society that are overly simplistic, deceiving, and gendered. The assumptions, however, are powerful ones, and the seeming inevitability of their particular meanings is reinforced by their incorporation into social structures and institutions, including law. Even though it might be acknowledged that the assumptions do not hold true in particular cases, they are held out as ideals and goals that can be realized, in part, through the promotion of free expression. In this way, freedom of expression &quot;comprehends a vision of society, a faith and a whole way of life.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety2">92</a></sup> It offers the promise of the good life---a promise of a society characterized by equality, individual self-fulfilment and autonomy, democracy, reason, and stability---if individuals are not restrained in their freedom of expression. In the context of the assumptions of this liberal vision, the promise seems plausible. However, when the assumptions and purposes of freedom of expression are themselves exposed as illusory, the promise falls flat. As in the case of pornography, the promise of freedom of expression can be appropriated by women seeking to change meanings and relationships of power. A demand can be made that the promises be met. To support such a demand, an alternative articulation of the purposes of freedom of expression is needed---an alternative premised on an understanding of the individual as socially constituted through relationships, language, and material circumstances.
<p>
Each of the three core purposes of the freedom of expression---truth-seeking, democracy, and individual self-fulfilment---can be re-stated in light of the arguments set out in this article. First, it has been asserted that there are no social truths to be found through free expression in an equal market-place of ideas. The goal of free expression cannot be the search for truth. Instead, one purpose of the right to freedom of expression must be <i>the constant questioning of claims to truth.</i> The problem here is not that falsehoods must be challenged so that truth will emerge, but that <i>some meanings are held out to be true.</i> The contingency and indeterminacy of these proposed &quot;truths,&quot; as well as the power that supports them, are obscured by the faith in truth. As a result, other ideas and perspectives, notably those with less power and fewer material and institutional resources behind them, are marginalized. Indeed, the universalizing nature of &quot;truths&quot; works to silence competing claims. In this way, the belief in the ideal of truth serves to <i>undermine</i> free expression. Although Mill argued that even if an idea represented the &quot;whole truth&quot; it must still be contested so it can be known rationally, the suggestion here is that it is not the truth or falsity of any idea that must be revealed through the clash of ideas, but, rather, the contingency of all meanings. An alternative purpose of freedom of expression, then, is to allow for meanings to be contested in the context of both an awareness of their contingency and an understanding of language as the site of political struggle over meaning. Importantly, as this alternative purpose acknowledges the role of power in fixing meanings, it underscores the need for an affirmative right to free expression, providing those who have less power to voice their views with the means to participate fully in the struggle to shape the world and themselves through language.
<p>
The purpose of promoting democracy rests on the assumption that all individuals have equal freedom of expression in the absence of governmental constraint. Given this equality, free expression promotes democracy by enabling everyone to participate in social decision-making processes. As in the case of truth, the assumption of equality masks real disparities in the power of discourses and access to the means of voicing opinions and ideas. In light of existing inequalities, and both social and judicial recognition of these, freedom of expression must be understood to encompass a positive right of access to resources and the media. Such a positive right would focus attention on questions of media ownership and control, and on the barriers to women's access.
<p>
Finally, the purpose of enabling individual self-fulfilment is premised on the assumption of autonomy, as well as a view of language as existing separate from individuals and expression as a means of developing an inherent individual personality. Yet, it has been argued that individuals are not autonomous. We are connected through our relationships and through language and meaning, all of which play a central role in the social construction of our
subjectivity and consciousness. An alternative purpose of free expression might be to promote a wider range of discourses and subject positions through which individuals can give meaning to their experiences and consciously live their lives. Again, the seemingly natural quality of dominant subject positions must be contested and resisted. 
<p>
This idea implicates another purpose of the right to freedom of expression that is less frequently articulated: the fostering of diversity and pluralism in society. According to this purpose, freedom of expression &quot;provides a key means for individuals and groups to exercise and manifest to others their cultural and ideological diversity. It aids in the fostering of a society in which individuals and groups can feel freer to be different.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety3">93</a></sup> This is indeed an important goal of free expression, but without acknowledging that difference is socially constructed through language and meaning in ways that create and re-create hierarchies and the oppression of difference, and without exposing the exercise of power through language, freedom of expression as it is currently interpreted will not promote this goal.
<p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

This paper has attempted to assess critically the assumptions underlying the judicial interpretation of the right to freedom of expression as guaranteed in s. 2(b) of the <cite>Charter</cite>, in light of the confounding issue of pornography. It has been argued that these assumptions are illusory and gendered, and, moreover, that they serve to re-create patriarchal power relations by masking both the exercise of power through language and the  &quot;harm&quot; in which expression can result. By reinterpreting the purposes of the right to freedom of expression, the value of this right is reaffirmed. It is because meanings are not fixed or determinate that language and meaning become important sites of political struggle. Thus, for women and other oppressed groups, the most pressing need is to articulate alternative discourses and to have access to the means to do so. It has been suggested that freedom of expression, if it is to fulfil its promises of a democratic, pluralistic society of &quot;equals,&quot; must be understood to encompass a positive right.
<p>
Of course, as a positive right, freedom of expression will not necessarily be legally enforceable. Given the current judicial retreat from an activist stance to the <cite>Charter</cite>'s guarantees and the move toward increasing deference to governmental objectives, the likelihood of judicial intervention to affirm more expression for oppressed groups is small indeed. However, even a position of deference does not preclude a judicial recognition of an alternative vision of freedom of expression. Judicial and social recognition of a positive right would give women a powerful tool for political resistance and lobbying.
<p>
The question of censorship must be reassessed from this alternative perspective. The current debate has been conducted largely within the parameters of the dominant interpretation of the right to freedom of expression. Importantly, censorship or any other restriction on expression, even if understood as a short-term remedy, seems to go against and possibly even undermine the call for a broader and more comprehensive right upon which active  resistance can be based. The strategy of resistance outlined here is a long-term and largely political one. I would suggest, however, that such a strategy can best serve the feminist goal of women's liberation. Not only does it enable the empowerment of women through expression and action, but it allows for the inclusion of <i>all</i> women's voices; sexuality is not defined by a monolithic interpretation of the meaning of pornography. Finally, it also permits the inclusion of men in the struggle for more constructive identities and relationships. Characterizing all men as oppressors, or ignoring each man's role in the construction of meanings, is not politically useful.

<li><a name="eighty1">MacKinnon</a> has in fact argued that pornography cannot be reformed or suppressed or banned---it can only be changed. However, as evidenced by her drafting of the Minneapolis Ordinances which seek to reconceptualize pornography as an equality issue within the context of American jurisprudence which has not yet recognized it as such, in the final analysis she is promoting the prohibition of pornographic material, although she would place the impetus for prohibition in the hands of women rather than the state. As some critics have pointed out, this approach does not really place power in the hands of women, but maintains a relationship of dependence on
the patriarchal state for enforcement.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

In Canada, same-sex couples are discriminated against <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> opposite-sex couples. Same-sex couples are denied benefits available to opposite-sex couples and thus are discouraged from forming functional families.<sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup> This discrimination is perpetuated not only by legislative exclusions but also by a judiciary that often interprets legislation in a discriminatory manner. In order to effectively redress this pervasive unfairness it is necessary not only to clearly identify areas of discrimination but also to recognize their entrenched male heterosexist roots. In addition, it is necessary to address perhaps the more problematic issue of <i>how</i>, once exposed, this discrimination can be remedied.<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup> The underlying theme of this &quot;how-to&quot; debate concerns whether equity can best be achieved by arguing for the inclusion of same-sex couples in the &quot;conventional family,&quot; and hence its benefits, or whether it is preferable to opt for an approach that is more active in deconstructing an institution many see as inherently oppressive and exclusionary.<sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup>
<p>
<h3>I.   Discrimination on the Basis of Sexual Orientation</h3>

The politics of sexual orientation have resulted in the perpetuation of dichotomies that attribute certain characteristics to same-sex couples and other, usually opposite, characteristics to opposite-sex couples. The attributes associated with opposite-sex couples are, for example, mutual dependence, stability, nurturing, childbearing, child rearing, and monogamy. The attributes associated with same-sex couples are independence, instability, autonomy, the inability to bear or properly raise children, and polygamy. Such dichotomous characterizations serve to rationalize the exclusion of same-sex couples from legislative schemes that accord benefits to opposite-sex couples.
<p>
In order for these characterizations to be &quot;effective&quot; in their perpetuation of this disadvantage, it is necessary that the two sets of attributes be viewed as opposite and mutually exclusive.<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup> As such, there is no room for the consideration of innovative family forms. There is only good and bad, right and wrong. The attributes associated with conventional families are valued; those associated with same-sex couples are devalued. Conventional families are cast as idealistic havens in a foreboding
world, while same-sex couples are cast as being devoid of those positive &quot;family&quot; attributes, as being part of the &quot;cold&quot; world.
<p>
It is clear that although conventional families are generally idealized, especially as compared with same-sex families, they at the same time serve as the site of much of the oppression faced by women.<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup> Women are characterized as possessing attributes that make them best suited to the private or family sphere, freeing men to participate in the public or labour sphere. Since women's work in the home is not valued, they are not paid, further reinforcing their &quot;dependence.&quot;  Viewed in this manner, it becomes clear that by threatening conventional families, the pursuit of same-sex spousal equality threatens not only heterosexual privilege, but <i>male</i> heterosexual privilege.
<p>
The denial of same-sex benefits, and the related judicial reasoning discussed below, should be understood and interpreted in this light. The &quot;protection&quot; of male heterosexist power lies at the root of the legislative and judicial discrimination faced by same-sex couples. It accounts for what appear to be strained attempts at effective judicial reasoning as well as the rationalizations given by governments for the exclusion of same-sex couples from benefit plans and human rights protection. This discrimination is a product of ingrained and pervasive oppression. Since the advent of Judeo-Christianity, male-dominated heterosexuality, as a social structure, has been the unquestioned norm.<sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup> And because it has become the &quot;norm,&quot; those who are &quot;different&quot; are marginalized.
<p>
Paradoxically, however, the threat that same-sex families pose to the conventional family form is juxtaposed against the threat that the conventional family form poses to same-sex couples. Because it is the norm, the ideology of the conventional family threatens to subsume the reality and uniqueness of same-sex families. For example, faced with a prejudiced judiciary, same-sex couples are often forced to employ &quot;sameness&quot; arguments in order to secure benefits traditionally available to opposite-sex couples. From another perspective, the legislative and judicial favouritism accorded to opposite-sex couples, combined with greater social approval of that which is &quot;the norm,&quot; makes it more attractive for many lesbians and gays to adopt the norm and deny their sexuality. However, despite the ability of same-sex couples to adopt most of the trappings of opposite-sex coupledom, sexuality remains a difference.<sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup>
<p>
Some lesbian and gay theorists argue that by seeking equal status as &quot;spouses,&quot; same-sex couples are implicitly perpetuating prevailing modes of heterosexist thinking. Although this debate is analysed in Part III, it is useful at this point to note that the perspective taken in this article is that &quot;the family&quot; is an evolving, and not static, institution. As a result of fighting stereotypes and seeking inclusion, advocates of lesbian and gay
rights will fundamentally transform the social and legislative conception of what constitutes an appropriate family unit. As it becomes more pluralistic and inclusive, &quot;the family&quot; will become a less oppressive institution.
<p>
Part I constitutes the first segment of this analysis and limits itself to a survey of the discrimination faced by same-sex couples. It is important to emphasize that the differential treatment described below amounts to discrimination, not merely distinction.<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup> As McIntyre J. stated in <cite>Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia</cite>, 
<blockquote>
[D]iscrimination may be described as a distinction, whether intentional or not but based on grounds relating to personal characteristics of the individual or group, which has the effect of imposing burdens, obligations, or disadvantages on such individual or group not imposed upon others, or which withholds or limits access to opportunities, benefits, and advantages available to other members of society.<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup>
</blockquote>
As will be seen throughout this article, judges resort to stereotypical assumptions about same-sex couples to conclude that since they are unlike opposite-sex couples, it is defensible to treat them differently. Yet without such things as spousal pension benefits, statutory mechanisms of dispute resolution, and family crisis leave, same-sex couples are denied the tools available to opposite-sex couples that aid in the formation of functional family units. 
<p>
A. WHO CAN AND CANNOT MARRY
<p>
In Canada, the federal government has the jurisdiction to enact laws regarding who can and cannot marry.<sup><a href="#ten">10</a></sup> These requirements, known as essential validity marriage requirements, have never been
comprehensively defined by the federal government and, consequently, there is no specific prohibition of same-sex
marriages.<sup><a href="#eleven">11</a></sup> The common law nevertheless requires that individuals be of
the opposite sex.<sup><a href="#twelve">12</a></sup>
<p>
When the invalidity of an essential requirement is established, such marriages are declared <i>void ab initio</i>, never to have occurred. This <i>de facto</i> prohibition against same-sex marriages is a message to same-sex couples that these relationships are not worthy of social legitimation.
<p>
On a more practical level, the result of the inability to marry is that same-sex partners are not automatically considered to be &quot;spouses,&quot; but rather are subjected to judicial and administrative interpretations of what it means to be a &quot;spouse.&quot;  Some of the legislation mentioned in the following sections clearly stipulates that &quot;spouses&quot; must be two people of the opposite sex;<sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup> however most simply refers to &quot;spouses,&quot; with no defining section.<sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup> In the former situation, there is a clear unwillingness to declare opposite-sex provisions unconstitutional. When afforded the discretion to determine what &quot;spouse&quot; means, judges tend to define the term in a discriminatory way, referring to other heterosexist legislative and dictionary definitions to support their assertions.<sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup> Much, if not most, of the inequitable treatment described below would be immediately undercut if same-sex couples were given the option to marry or, in other words, the ability to become &quot;spouses.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup>
<p>
B. IMMIGRATION
<p>
At present, the <cite>Immigration Act</cite>'s stated purpose of &quot;facilitat[ing] the reunion in Canada of Canadian citizens and permanent residents with their close relatives from abroad&quot; is limited to the reunification of married spouses, fianc&eacute;s and fianc&eacute;es, parents, grandparents, children, adopted children, grandchildren, brothers and sisters, and nieces and nephews.<sup><a href="#seventeen">17</a></sup> Although individual gays and lesbians are no longer barred from entering Canada,<sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup> they are unable to sponsor lesbian and gay partners for the purpose of immigrating to Canada.<sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a></sup> However, applications for immigration can be approved on &quot;humanitarian and compassionate grounds.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty">20</a></sup>
<p>
C. SOCIAL ASSISTANCE
<p>
In this area of provincial legislation, same-sex couples are actually at an advantage, but for unfortunate reasons. When an individual's &quot;need&quot; for social assistance<sup><a href="#twenty1">21</a></sup> is tested, a welfare caseworker will take into account whether there is a &quot;spouse&quot; on whom the claimant can rely for support. If the claimant is a woman, a male &quot;spouse&quot; is often assumed to be sharing his income with her,
irrespective of whether this is the actual situation. Whether or not the man is a &quot;spouse&quot; and hence supporting the claimant is often based on considerations as trivial as whether the two are having sexual relations.<sup><a href="#twenty2">22</a></sup> The statutory scheme reflects the presumption that opposite-sex relationships are caring, supportive, and interdependent. As same-sex relationships are presupposed to have none of these characteristics, support between same-sex partners is deemed to exist less frequently.<sup><a href="#twenty3">23</a></sup>
<p>
D. FAMILY EMERGENCIES
<p>
The ability of family members to help one another in crisis situations is a crucial component in the development and maintenance of family bonds. Opposite-sex couples benefit from statutes that confer rights and benefits when such situations occur. Notable exceptions to this rule are Ontario's <cite>Substitute Decisions Act, 1992</cite><sup><a href="#twenty4">24</a></sup> and <cite>Consent to Treatment Act, 1992</cite>.<sup><a href="#twenty5">25</a></sup> Both Acts define &quot;partners&quot; as 
<blockquote>
[persons who] have lived together for at least one year and have a close personal relationship that is of primary importance in both persons' lives.<sup><a href="#twenty6">26</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Nevertheless, if one partner should die, the surviving same-sex partner could not collect benefits pursuant to the <cite>Workers' Compensation Act</cite><sup><a href="#twenty7">27</a></sup> or the <cite>Compensation for Victims of Crime Act</cite>.<sup><a href="#twenty8">28</a></sup> It is even questionable whether a same-sex partner is entitled to leave from work to attend the funeral of his or her lover. The Supreme Court of Canada recently ruled that Brian Mossop was not entitled to funeral leave to attend the funeral of his partner's father on the grounds that his partner, and hence his partner's father, were not &quot;immediate family members&quot; as provided for in the governing collective agreement.<sup><a href="#twenty9">29</a></sup> The case arose out of a challenge brought by Mossop that this denial violated the provision of the <cite>Canadian Human Rights Act</cite> [<cite>CHRA</cite>] that prohibits discrimination on the basis of family status.<sup><a href="#thirty">30</a></sup> Mossop's appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was denied on the grounds that discrimination on the basis of family status cannot be interpreted to include discrimination against same-sex couples since at the time of the inclusion of the family status ground in 1983, Parliament specifically decided not to include sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination.<sup><a href="#thirty1">31</a></sup>
<p>
It is important to note that Mossop narrowed the scope of the appeal by not raising any  <cite>Charter</cite><sup><a href="#thirty2">32</a></sup> issues and in particular by not referring to the <cite>Birch</cite> decision, which read sexual orientation into the <cite>CHRA</cite>.<sup><a href="#thirty3">33</a></sup> The appeal was confined to whether same-sex couples constituted a family under the
<cite>CHRA</cite> and thus whether there was discrimination on the basis of family status.<sup><a href="#thirty4">34</a></sup> Given that the Court failed to read a human rights document in a broad and purposive manner, it is unlikely that the Court would be any more flexible in interpreting other types of statutes when determining whether same-sex partners are &quot;spouses&quot; or whether they constitute a &quot;family.&quot;
<p>
E. INCOME TAX ACT
<p>
The <cite>Income Tax Act</cite> [<cite>ITA</cite>] contains provisions that accord benefits based on spousal status.<sup><a href="#thirty5">35</a></sup> Despite early reluctance,<sup><a href="#thirty6">36</a></sup> the federal government has recently amended the <cite>ITA</cite> to specifically define the term &quot;spouse&quot; to include common law, opposite-sex couples.<sup><a href="#thirty7">37</a></sup> Same-sex couples cannot benefit from provisions such as those relating to spousal tax credits;<sup><a href="#thirty8">38</a></sup> inter-spousal transfers of unused pension, education, and disability credits;<sup><a href="#thirty9">39</a></sup> and registered retirement savings plans.<sup><a href="#forty">40</a></sup> It is interesting to note how these
&quot;transfers&quot; benefit one-income families,<sup><a href="#forty1">41</a></sup> promoting the stereotypically conventional family in which there is one (male) breadwinner.
<p>
F. PENSIONS
<p>
Statutory pension schemes in Canada account for the existence of opposite-sex marriages or partnerships only.<sup><a href="#forty2">42</a></sup> For example, the term &quot;spouse&quot; in the <cite>Public
Service Pension Act</cite> is defined as 
<blockquote>
either of a man or a woman who,
<p>
(a) are married to each other, or
<p>
(b) are not married to each other and are living together in a conjugal relationship 
<blockquote>
(i) continuously for a period of not less than three years or
<p>
(ii) in a relationship of some permanence, if they are the natural or adoptive parents, as defined in the Family Law Act, 1986, of a child.<sup><a href="#forty3">43</a></sup>
</blockquote></blockquote>
This statute was recently successfully challenged<sup><a href="#forty4">44</a></sup> as being in violation of the
<cite>Ontario Human Rights Code</cite> provision protecting against discrimination based on sexual  orientation.<sup><a href="#forty5">45</a></sup>
<p>
A recent <cite>Charter</cite> challenge of similar pension provisions was not, however, as successful. James Egan and John Nesbit failed in their s. 15 <cite>Charter</cite> challenge of the <cite>Old Age Security Act</cite>, which also excludes same-sex couples.<sup><a href="#forty6">46</a></sup> The <cite>Old Age Security Act</cite> defines &quot;spouse&quot; as 
<blockquote>
a person of the opposite sex who is living with that person, having lived with that person for at least one year, if the two persons have publicly represented themselves as husband and wife.<sup><a href="#forty7">47</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The trial judge, in denying their suit, used the logic that since Egan and Nesbit did not fall into the category of &quot;spouses,&quot; they were not entitled to the same treatment as other (married and common law) spouses.<sup><a href="#forty8">48</a></sup> This ruling was affirmed at the Federal Court of Appeal for similar reasons.<sup><a href="#forty9">49</a></sup>
<p>
G. CUSTODY
<p>
In Ontario, child custody disputes are resolved according to what would be &quot;in the best interests of the child.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty">50</a></sup> The <cite>Children's Law Reform Act</cite> instructs judges to use, among others, the following criteria in evaluating the custody ruling that would be in the best interest of the child: the permanence and stability of the family unit in which it is proposed that the child will live; the relationship between the child and the person claiming custody; current and proposed living arrangements; and any past conduct relevant to the proposed custodian's ability to act as a parent.<sup><a href="#fifty1">51</a></sup> The <cite>Divorce Act</cite>, which applies to custody disputes that arise out of divorce, states similar criteria.<sup><a href="#fifty2">52</a></sup>
<p>
These &quot;best interest&quot; criteria are problematic for same-sex parents for two principal reasons. First, judges may be unwilling to consider a same-sex partnership as a &quot;stable family unit,&quot; adhering to the dichotomous conception that same-sex relationships are fleeting and unstable whereas opposite-sex relationships are stable and nurturing. And, as Katherine Arnup notes, because same-sex couples often have to stay secretive about their relationships, it is more difficult to offer conclusive evidence as to the permanence of such relationships.<sup><a href="#fifty3">53</a></sup>
<p>
Second, judicial discretion determines the extent to which homosexual conduct is considered to affect a parent's ability to parent. Although some judges pay lip service to the fact that being gay or lesbian is not a relevant consideration in determining child custody, many decisions indicate that sexual orientation is often considered
to be a negative factor. For example, in <cite>Bezaire v. Bezaire</cite>, Arnup J. states that &quot;(i)n my view homosexuality . . . is not in itself a ground for refusing custody&quot; but then qualifies this by stating that 
<blockquote>
It would be wrong to lay down any general rule as to the weight to be given to the evidence of homosexuality on the part of one of the parents. As I have said, in each case it is an aspect which the trial judge, upon hearing the evidence, must consider but from the aspect of the effect or likely effect upon the welfare of the children.<sup><a href="#fifty4">54</a></sup>
</blockquote>
In this case, Arnup J. was deferring to a trial judge who had stated that
<blockquote>
[I]t will be a condition of the custody order that no other person shall reside with Mrs. Bezaire without the approval of the court . . . I have indicated that I am attempting to improve the situation and that includes negativing any open, declared and avowed lesbian or homosexual relationship.<sup><a href="#fifty5">55</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Like the trial judge in <cite>Bezaire</cite>, most judges are relatively straightforward about the inferences they draw from the finding that a parent is gay or lesbian. In <cite>Bernhardt v. Bernhardt</cite>, Hamilton J., in awarding custody to the father, stated that &quot;[t]he child clearly wishes to stay with her mother, <i>but</i>
the mother appears committed to a lesbian relationship, is unemployed and is given to heavy drinking, violence and
profanity&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty6">56</a></sup> (emphasis added). In <cite>K. v. K.</cite>, Rowe J. states that &quot;Mrs. K.'s homosexuality is, in my opinion, no more of a bar to her obtaining custody than is the fact of Mr K.'s drug use.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty7">57</a></sup> The inappropriateness of these comparisons aside, being lesbian or gay was determined in <cite>K. v. K.</cite> to be a lesser impediment than drug use, although the judge was satisfied that Mrs K.'s lesbian relationship &quot;will be discreet and will not be flaunted to the children or to the community at large.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty8">58</a></sup>
<p>
Paradoxically, the amount of judicial discretion afforded to judges to determine what is in the best interest of children has been unfavourable for lesbian and gay parents and, in turn, not in the best interests of the children. This discretion permits Courts to adhere to dichotomous views of relationships: opposite-sex relationships are nurturing and provide for good role models, same-sex relationships are destructive and provide for bad role models. 
<p>
H. DIVISION OF PROPERTY
<p>
Under the <cite>Family Law Act</cite> of Ontario,<sup><a href="#fifty9">59</a></sup> only two people who are married can benefit from the division of property regime found in that <cite>Act</cite>. This regime
seeks to ensure the equal sharing of the wealth that accrued to the couple during the marriage. Its stated purpose is to foster marriage as an equal partnership, with the presumption that equal contributions are made by the spouses throughout the marriage.<sup><a href="#sixty">60</a></sup> But whereas opposite-sex couples have control over the extent to which the regime applies to them, by making marriage contracts or by not marrying, same-sex couples can rely only on the doctrine of constructive trust.<sup><a href="#sixty1">61</a></sup> For example, in <cite>Anderson v. Luoma</cite>, the B.C. Supreme Court divided a lesbian couple's property according to this doctrine to reflect the partners' relative economic
contributions to the relationship.<sup><a href="#sixty2">62</a></sup>
<p>
I.  SPOUSAL SUPPORT
<p>
On marriage breakdown, both married and common law couples benefit from the <cite>Family Law Act</cite> provisions for spousal support.<sup><a href="#sixty3">63</a></sup> Support orders are calculated by the courts in light of the objectives enumerated in the <cite>Act</cite>.<sup><a href="#sixty4">64</a></sup> Recent rulings have aimed to compensate spouses for the loss of income-earning potential that is causally connected to the marriage.<sup><a href="#sixty5">65</a></sup> Opposite-sex couples have a choice of regime: they can accept the support scheme of the <cite>FLA</cite> or make a domestic contract to modify it in any way.<sup><a href="#sixty6">66</a></sup> Same-sex couples can only make domestic contracts. Although a feasible alternative for the contractually sophisticated, domestic contracts are nevertheless inferior to support orders in that they are often drafted when the circumstances relating to the relationship breakdown are not known.
<p>
J. INTESTACY
<p>
Same-sex couples are equally disadvantaged compared with opposite couples if the partnership ends with death. If the deceased same-sex partner does not have a will, then the surviving partner will not receive any of the deceased's assets, aside from a possible constructive trust claim on the deceased's estate.<sup><a  href="#sixty7">67</a></sup> In contrast, the surviving spouse of a marriage can elect to receive his or her entitlement to property under the deceased's will, if a will exists, or as per the division of property regime in the <cite>Family Law Act.</cite><sup><a href="#sixty8">68</a></sup> Dependant's relief is also available only to dependants of marriages and common law relationships.<sup><a href="#sixty9">69</a></sup>
<p>
K. HUMAN RIGHTS CODES
<p>
Sexual orientation is not a prohibited ground of discrimination in the human rights codes of six Canadian
jurisdictions: Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, and the Northwest Territories. Unlike the <cite>Charter</cite>, which protects against discrimination on grounds enumerated in s. 15 or upon analogous grounds,<sup><a href="#seventy">70</a></sup> the protection afforded by these human rights codes is limited to those grounds of discrimination that are enumerated. In these jurisdictions, private acts of discrimination<sup><a href="#seventy1">71</a></sup> on the basis of sexual orientation are legally acceptable, and only when the discriminating body can be considered to be &quot;government&quot; will the <cite>Charter</cite> afford some protection.<sup><a href="#seventy2">72</a></sup>
<p>
The constitutionality of human rights codes that do not conform to the <cite>Charter</cite> was addressed by the Ontario Court of Appeal decision in <cite>Birch.</cite><sup><a href="#seventy3">73</a></sup> The Court ruled not only that sexual orientation was a prohibited ground of discrimination under the <cite>Charter</cite>, but also that the <cite>CHRA</cite> itself was unconstitutional for excluding sexual orientation as a prohibited ground. As a remedy, it &quot;read in&quot; sexual orientation to the <cite>CHRA</cite>.<sup><a href="#seventy4">74</a></sup> The federal government did not appeal the decision, and introduced legislation to amend the <cite>CHRA</cite> to conform to the <cite>Birch</cite> decision. <sup><a href="#seventy5">75</a></sup>
<p>
It is interesting to note that most academic literature concentrates almost exclusively on the <cite>Charter</cite> as the means by which the inequities faced by same-sex couples can best be redressed.<sup><a href="#seventy6">76</a></sup> This emphasis can be explained by several observations. First, as has been noted, human rights code protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation exists only in seven jurisdictions<sup><a href="#seventy7">77</a></sup> and is limited to enumerated activities alone. Second, in contrast to court actions, human rights complainants lose control over their complaints once they are submitted. The Ontario Human Rights Commission, for example, takes
over the investigation of the complaint and renders a decision as to whether or not the complaint can proceed to the hearing stage. The Commission's decision, subject to one &quot;reconsideration,&quot; is
final.<sup><a href="#seventy8">78</a></sup> Third, the <cite>Charter</cite> is a document of more
powerful symbolic and jurisprudential importance and is hence a more effective way of challenging the <i>status quo</i> and redressing the inequities faced by same-sex couples. Lastly, and perhaps most
significant, human rights codes are not as efficient in practice as they were designed to be. Several years may pass before a claim is resolved; some cases have stretched out over five years.<sup><a href="#seventy9">79</a></sup> The Ontario Government is currently investigating ways in which to overhaul the Ontario Human Rights Commission.<sup><a href="#eighty">80</a></sup>
<p>
L. SUMMARY
<p>
It is interesting to note that the above examples of legislative discrimination against same-sex couples are a result of underinclusive legislation. The existence of this legislation, coupled with judicial prejudice when it is being interpreted in the courts, undermines the ability of same-sex couples to form functional families. First, same-sex couples are not afforded the financial benefits that are made available to opposite-sex couples. Second, although same-sex couples are free to make contracts which mimic the effects of legislation such as the <cite>Family Law Act</cite>, such an alternative is practically available only to those who are relatively wealthy and legally sophisticated. Last, and possibly most significant, the discretion accorded to courts by virtue of unclear or imprecise legislation is almost always used to the detriment of lesbian and gay claimants, particularly in the area of child custody. Courts continue to perpetuate dichotomies that typify same-sex couples as being unstable, unsupportive, polygamous, and unable to bear or properly raise children. Opposite-sex couples are conversely characterized as virtuous and therefore, implicitly, more deserving of state benefits and favourable court judgments.
<p>
Although gays and lesbians are, theoretically, free to form relationships that have many of the indicia of functional families,<sup><a href="#eighty1">81</a></sup> the state, by making one family form financially and socially preferable,<sup><a href="#eighty2">82</a></sup> and the judiciary, by rendering homophobic judgments, indirectly discourage their creation. This discouragement should be viewed as a reaction to the threat that same-sex couples pose to a male heterosexual-dominated society. The following sections will discuss, in greater detail, the nature of this threat and the strategies that can be employed to counter this discrimination most effectively.
<p>
<h3>II. The <cite>Charter</cite></h3>

Placed against this discrimination is a relatively progressive <cite>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite>.<sup><a href="#eighty3">83</a></sup> As Bruce Ryder describes it, there is a
compassion/no-condonation dichotomy operating within Canadian society. He characterizes the exclusion of same-sex benefits from legislation and the hesitancy of judges and legislatures to change these laws as reflecting the desire not to condone, or at least not to be seen as condoning, what is to many an abhorrent and sinful lifestyle. On the other hand, he notes a highly compassionate streak in Canadian society, as reflected by the <cite>Charter</cite>, several human rights codes, and opinion polls, which abhors any type of discrimination.<sup><a href="#eighty4">84</a></sup>
<p>
Despite this &quot;compassion,&quot; the remedial route offered by the <cite>Charter</cite> has been compromised by the courts. Although obtaining <cite>Charter</cite> protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation should be relatively straightforward, as will be illustrated, courts often undercut this protection by adhering to narrow and outdated judicial reasoning that relies on stereotype in
denying same-sex couples full protection. These types of reasoning will be discussed not only in order to illustrate homophobic interpretations of the <cite>Charter</cite> but also in order to uncover the tactics that block successful same-sex spousal <cite>Charter</cite> litigation. Such tactics include the revival of the discarded similarly-situated test and the use of unconvincing s. 1 justifications which reveal the homophobic attitudes of the respective judges.
<p>
These strained attempts to deny same-sex couples equality attest to the fact that same-sex couples are seen as a threat to the established order and the privilege that flows from it. This established order involves a hierarchy of social relations in which men are the dominant sex, heterosexuality the accepted sexual
orientation, and conventional families the idealized form of familial arrangement. The ability of same-sex couples to form functional families is stymied by reasoning that is designed to protect this privilege. And because this privilege has existed for so long, it has become the &quot;norm&quot; and is accepted as the &quot;truth.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty5">85</a></sup>
<p>
A. THE SECTION 15 TEST
<p>
Section 15 of the <cite>Charter</cite> guarantees that 
<blockquote>
Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to equal benefit and equal protection of the law without discrimination and, <i>in particular</i>, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.
</blockquote>
The test for determining whether a s. 15 violation has taken place is found in <cite>Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia</cite>:<sup><a href="#eighty6">86</a></sup>
<blockquote>
A complainant under s. 15 must show not only that he or she is not receiving equal treatment before and under the law or that the law has a differential impact on him or her in the protection or benefit accorded by law but, <i>in addition</i>, must show that the impact of the law is discriminatory.<sup><a href="#eighty7">87</a></sup> [emphasis added]
</blockquote>
Whether or not sexual orientation can be considered an analogous ground of discrimination to those listed in s. 15 is considered as part of the second branch of the test.<sup><a href="#eighty8">88</a></sup>
<p>
The purpose of the four equality rights in s. 15, as expressed by McIntyre J. in <cite>Andrews</cite>, is to ensure that &quot;a law . . . should not because of irrelevant personal differences have a more burdensome or less beneficial impact on one than another.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty9">89</a></sup> In particular, &quot;equal benefit of the law&quot; has been defined as referring to the stipulation that individuals must benefit equally from the existence of government benefit programs.<sup><a href="#ninety">90</a></sup> It would not be difficult for same-sex couples who were subject to the discrimination noted previously to argue successfully that they were not being accorded &quot;equal benefit of the law.&quot;  Same-sex couples are clearly treated differently from opposite-sex couples under these laws.
<p>
What must be shown in the second branch of the test is that these distinctions constitute &quot;discrimination.&quot;  To establish this, it must be shown that (a) the different treatment results in
disadvantage and (b) the complainant is a member of an enumerated, analogous, or &quot;protected&quot; group.<sup><a href="#ninety1">91</a></sup> According to McIntyre J.,
<blockquote>
[D]iscrimination may be described as a distinction, whether intentional or not but based on grounds relating to personal characteristics of the individual or group, <i>which has the effect of imposing burdens, obligations or disadvantages on such individual or group not imposed upon others, or which withholds or
limits access to opportunities, benefits and advantages available to other members of society</i>.<sup><a href="#ninety2">92</a></sup> [emphasis added]
</blockquote>
Denying same-sex spousal benefits clearly has the result of hindering the formation of functional same-sex families, both in terms of the economic disadvantage caused by the laws mentioned above and also in terms of the stereotypical assumptions that these laws reinforce regarding such things as a lesbian or gay person's ability to be a parent, a lesbian or gay person's ability to be caring, and a lesbian or gay person's ability to have a meaningful, committed relationship. This legislative discrimination, coupled with judicial prejudice, dissuades same-sex couples from forming these types of relationships and hence hinders the ability of lesbians and gays to participate fully in Canadian society.<sup><a href="#ninety3">93</a></sup>
<p>
Determining whether or not sexual orientation is to be included as an analogous form of discrimination under s. 15 involves the consideration of various factors, factors that are best encompassed by McIntyre J.'s statement that s. 15 is designed to protect &quot;discrete and insular minorities.&quot;<sup><a   href="#ninety4">94</a></sup> In <cite>Turpin</cite>, Wilson J. noted the indicia of &quot;stereotyping,
historical disadvantage [and] vulnerability to political and social prejudice,&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety5">95</a></sup> adding that
<blockquote>
[T]his categorization is not an end in itself but merely one of the analytical tools which are of assistance in determining whether an interest advanced by a particular claimant is the kind of interest s. 15 of the <cite>Charter</cite> is designed to protect. It is a means of ensuring that equality rights are given the same broad, purposive interpretation accorded to other <cite>Charter</cite> rights.<sup><a href="#ninety6">96</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Historically, prejudice and social stigmatization has resulted in lesbians and gays leading lives removed from the mainstream. And, as was discussed previously, not only have legislative enactments resulted in the perpetuation of lesbian and gay insularity, but court judgments as well have served to perpetuate stereotypical assumptions about lesbians and gays. In addition, even the more homophobic  judgments contain admissions that lesbians and gays do constitute a distinct group.<sup><a href="#ninety7">97</a></sup> Finally, it is important to note that sexual orientation often is conceded by counsel for the government as being an analogous ground of discrimination.<sup><a href="#ninety8">98</a></sup> These concessions are consistent with government policy statements.<sup><a href="#ninety9">99</a></sup>
<p>
B. THE &quot;SIMILARLY-SITUATED&quot; PROBLEM
<p>
A problematic aspect of same-sex <cite>Charter</cite> litigation is that courts have tended to revive the &quot;similarly-situated&quot; discrimination test that seemed to have been discredited conclusively
by McIntyre J. in <cite>Andrews</cite>.<sup><a href="#onehundred">100</a></sup> An emphasis on this analysis is therefore necessary in any s. 15 discussion regarding sexual orientation. As McIntyre J. stated in <cite>Andrews</cite>, &quot;[A] bad law will not be saved merely because it operates equally upon those to whom it has application.&quot;<sup><a href="#one01">101</a></sup> In criticizing the decision in <cite>Bliss v. A.G. Canada</cite>,<sup><a href="#one02">102</a></sup> where Bliss' claim that she was discriminated against because she was pregnant was dismissed because all pregnant people, the class formed by the legislation, were treated equally, McIntyre J. stated that &quot;[t]his case, of course, was decided before the advent of the <cite>Charter</cite>.&quot;<sup><a href="#one03">103</a></sup> He also adopted the following criticism of the similarly-situated test:
<blockquote>
[T]he test accepts an idea of equality which is almost mechanical, with no scope for considering the reason for the distinction. In consequence, subtleties are found to justify a finding of dissimilarity which reduce the test to a categorization game. Moreover, the test is not helpful. After all, most laws are enacted for the specific purpose of offering a benefit or imposing a burden on some persons and not others.<sup><a href="#one04">104</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Moreover, McIntyre J. noted that
<blockquote>
[T]he test cannot be accepted as a fixed rule or formula for the resolution of equality questions arising under the <cite>Charter</cite>. Consideration must be given to the content of the law, to its purpose, and its impact upon those to whom it applies, and also upon those whom it excludes from its application. The issues which will arise from case to case are such that it would be wrong to attempt to confine these considerations within such a fixed and limited formula.<sup><a href="#one05">105</a></sup>
</blockquote>
An effective s. 15 test must look beyond individual legislatively created categories and analyse how individuals are treated across categories. The &quot;larger context&quot; must be examined.<sup><a href="#one06">106</a></sup> 
<p>
In the <cite>Egan</cite> trial, although Martin J. specifically denies using a similarly situated test, this is exactly what he does:
<blockquote>
Parliament has chosen to address the needs of persons of the opposite sex who live together in a conjugal state, either statutory or common law, as husband and wife . . . [The same-sex] <i>relationship is a different one than a spousal relationship</i> and . . . the parties to such [a] relationship cannot expect to share the benefits accorded to those in spousal relationships, not because of their sexual orientation, but because their relationship is not a spousal one.<sup><a href="#one07">107</a></sup> [emphasis added]
</blockquote>
Martin J. deferred to the categorization made by Parliament and was satisfied that individuals within that category were being treated equally. In addition, Martin J.'s rationalization that the case should be dismissed because of the plaintiff's lack of spousal status is misleading. He ignored the reality that the only reason their relationship was not a spousal one was their sexual orientation. Martin J. also ignored jurisprudence that confirms that an enumerated or analogous group does not have to be specifically mentioned in a statute in order for there to be a finding of discrimination on that ground. In <cite>Brooks v. Canada Safeway Ltd.</cite>,<sup><a href="#one08">108</a></sup> although the impugned group insurance plan discriminated on the basis of pregnancy, the Supreme Court found discrimination on the basis of sex since only women could become pregnant.<sup><a href="#one09">109</a></sup> In <cite>Knodel</cite>, Rowles J. held that there was discrimination based on sexual orientation specifically because the legislative definition of &quot;spouse&quot; did not include same-sex partners.<sup><a href="#one10">110</a></sup>
<p>
At the Federal Court of Appeal, Robertson J. also supported Parliament's categorization:
<blockquote>
Before us is a case in which a benefit has been conferred on a narrow class of persons who can be readily identified and who are in financial need because of a pattern of financial interdependency, characteristic of heterosexual couples, and which cannot in any reasonable way be deemed relevant to same-sex couples or, for that matter, other non-spousal relationships.<sup><a href="#one11">111</a></sup>
</blockquote>
It is clear that Robertson J.'s reasoning rests on his adherence to the dichotomous view that opposite-sex relationships are characterized by interdependence while same-sex relationships are characterized by independence. Moreover, it is unclear how opposite-sex couples, aside from those who have marriage
certificates, are any more &quot;identifiable&quot; than same-sex couples.<sup><a href="#one12">112</a></sup> 
<p>
In <cite>Andrews 2</cite>, lesbian partners sought a declaration that the exclusion of same-sex couples from the definition of &quot;spouse&quot; in the <cite>Health Insurance Act</cite> violated their right to equality under s. 15.<sup><a href="#one13">113</a></sup> The trial judge, McRae J., dismissed this claim on the grounds that since the applicants were not similarly situated to married couples, they were not entitled to the benefits accorded to married couples.<sup><a href="#one14">114</a></sup> Further, McRae J. noted that there was no discrimination, because the applicants were treated similarly to other excluded &quot;couples&quot; who may be living together, such as common law couples.<sup><a href="#one15">115</a></sup> The exclusion of two groups, as opposed to just one, is not a justification for s. 15 infringement. In addition, whereas common law partners can marry, same-sex couples cannot. This judgment was specifically criticized by the British Columbia Supreme Court in <cite>Knodel</cite>, with Rowles J. noting that the similarly-situated test was rejected by the Supreme Court of Canada in <cite>Andrews</cite>.<sup><a href="#one16">116</a></sup>
<p>
It is also interesting to note that despite government commitments to ensure that sexual orientation is a prohibited ground of discrimination in all areas of federal jurisdiction,<sup><a href="#one17">117</a></sup> lawyers from the Department of Justice continue to argue their cases using reasoning similar to that noted above. In <cite>Knodel</cite>, counsel for the Crown argued that the definition of spouse &quot;does not make a distinction based upon sexual orientation but is simply a
distinction between `spouses' and `non-spouses.'&quot;<sup><a href="#one18">118</a></sup> Similarly, the factum submitted by the Department of Justice in <cite>Veysey</cite> argued that &quot;the respondent was denied his visit, not because of his sexual orientation, but because the person he nominated for the proposed visit was not his spouse. . . .&quot;<sup><a href="#one19">119</a></sup> Such arguments clearly put into question the Department of Justice's commitment to eliminating discrimination based on sexual orientation.
<p>
These arguments and judicial reasoning indicate that judges and possibly Crown lawyers simply cannot conceive of same-sex couples as being able to form relationships that are loving, emotionally and financially supportive, and/or that include children. There is a rigid adherence to dichotomous perceptions that opposite-sex couples possess all of these characteristics and same-sex couples possess none of them. It is because of this mutual exclusivity that same-sex couples are often put in the position of arguing sameness as a justification for entitlement. The implicit message is that same-sex couples are worthy of state benefits and recognition only if they are like opposite-sex couples. But, as <cite>Andrews 2</cite> illustrates, this pursuit is most often in vain. Despite the similarity of the claimants' lesbian relationship to that of the conventional family,<sup><a href="#one20">120</a></sup> their sexual orientation proved determinative.
<p>
C. REMEDY REQUESTED
<p>
Another potentially problematic area of <cite>Charter</cite> jurisprudence is whether or not courts will award a remedy that imposes a financial burden on governments. Although courts have traditionally been hesitant to usurp federal spending powers, there are indications that a court may do so when a <cite>Charter</cite> right has been violated. Notable among cases in which a financial burden is placed on governments is <cite>Re Singh and the Minister of Employment and Immigration</cite>, where the Supreme Court of Canada declared the principles of the <cite>Charter</cite> to be above all but the most extreme cost considerations.<sup><a href="#one21">121</a></sup> Although the Supreme Court has since retreated from that relatively bold stance, it has recently upheld the ability of courts to make rulings, pursuant to s. 24(1) of the <cite>Charter</cite>, that impose financial burdens on governments.<sup><a href="#one22">122</a></sup> Section 24(1) states:
<blockquote>
Anyone whose rights or freedoms, as guaranteed by this Charter, have been infringed or denied may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances.
</blockquote>
Because the denial of spousal benefits is usually the result of a wrongful exclusion, the necessary remedy would be either &quot;reading in&quot; a provision which would make the statute consistent with the
<cite>Charter</cite> or declaring the legislation invalid, with the possibility of suspending this declaration pending acceptable amendments by a legislature. In <cite>Schachter</cite>, the Supreme Court enunciated the following principles: First, it must be decided whether reading in, declaring the legislation invalid, or declaring part of the legislation invalid interferes least with the original scheme and purpose of the legislation in question.<sup><a href="#one23">123</a></sup> Second, reading in must not impose a
&quot;substantial&quot; financial burden on the legislature.<sup><a href="#one24">124</a></sup> Third, a suspended declaration of invalidity will be made whenever it is not feasible to read in a provision, according to the above criteria, and whenever an immediate declaration of invalidity would have overly harsh repercussions on the general public or would be inconsistent with the overall purpose of the <cite>Charter</cite>.<sup><a href="#one25">125</a></sup>
<p>
With regard to the requirement that the legislative objective remain intact, it is possible for a court to find that extending spousal benefits to same-sex couples is contrary to Parliament's intention of promoting conventional families. However, because a declaration of invalidity would likely have an even greater impact on those families that the legislature is seeking to promote, this seems unlikely. For example, not having old age pension benefits at all arguably harms such families more than would extending the benefit to same-sex
couples. A likely alternative, however, is a court declaring the legislation invalid, but temporarily suspending the invalidity pending a legislative resolution of the matter. A court will likely opt for this alternative if it does not want to be responsible for altering laws which perpetuate male heterosexual privilege.
<p>
The ruling in <cite>Schachter</cite> makes the third possibility, reading in the inclusion of same-sex couples, the least problematic. Courts can impose a financial burden on governments as long as the group
sought to be included is proportionately small relative to the group already included.<sup><a href="#one26">126</a></sup> In the case of <cite>Schachter</cite>, the Supreme Court refused to extend benefits that were already available to adoptive parents to natural parents, noting that this latter group &quot;likely vastly outnumbers&quot; the former group.<sup><a href="#one27">127</a></sup> Lamer C.J. contrasted this to the situation in <cite>T&eacute;trault-Gadoury v. Canada</cite>,<sup><a  href="#one28">128</a></sup> where it was decided that benefits which had previously been restricted to those under the age of 65 should be extended to those over the age of 65.<sup><a href="#one29">129</a></sup> Same-sex couples, relative to opposite-sex couples, are a similarly &quot;small, discrete group.&quot;<sup><a href="#one30">130</a></sup> In fact, the Ontario Court of Appeal in <cite>Birch</cite> stated that lesbians and gays do constitute a small enough group, relative to heterosexuals, to warrant the &quot;reading in&quot; option.<sup><a href="#one31">131</a></sup>
<p>
D. SECTION 1
<p>
Section 1 allows for much judicial discretion in deciding whether there has been a justifiable limitation on the enjoyment of <cite>Charter</cite> rights. Hence, it is likely to be the most problematic aspect of same-sex spousal litigation. According to the <cite>Oakes</cite> test, the government has the onus of proving that a
<cite>Charter</cite> right has been limited for &quot;pressing and substantial&quot; reasons that are consistent with the promotion of a &quot;free and democratic society&quot; and that the means chosen are
proportional to the ends sought.<sup><a href="#one32">132</a></sup>
<p>
It is most likely that governments will justify a s. 15 infringement in the name of promoting &quot;traditional families.&quot;  This assertion involves many related issues: Why does the state want to foster this particular family form? Is it procreation? Is it capitalism? Is it Christianity? Is it male heterosexual privilege? Crown counsel often admits that the government has chosen to benefit conventional family units.<sup><a href="#one33">133</a></sup> In <cite>Andrews 2</cite>, McRae J. stated that the promotion of traditional families is a valid governmental objective for s. 1.<sup><a href="#one34">134</a></sup> It is important to
expose the bias underlying this assertion in order to discredit it as a valid s. 1 objective.<sup><a href="#one35">135</a></sup>
<p>
One of the primary stated purposes of the promotion of conventional families is to encourage procreation, despite the fact that the capacity to procreate has never been a necessary requirement to marry. <sup><a href="#one36">136</a></sup> In fact, at common law, lack of <i>consummation</i> is no longer even a ground for voiding a marriage.<sup><a href="#one37</a></sup> Same-sex couples are actually being held to the higher standard of having to be able to <i>procreate</i>, McRae J. stating in Andrews that &quot;[h]omosexual couples are <i>not</i> similarly situated to opposite-sex couples. Heterosexual couples procreate and raise children.&quot;<sup><a href="#one38">138</a></sup> McRae J.'s adherence to dichotomous characterizations of same-sex couples ignores the reality that not only can same-sex couples &quot;raise children&quot; but that new reproductive technologies do provide for alternative ways to
procreate aside from vaginal intercourse.
<p>
Another common s. 1 justification is administrative convenience.<sup><a href="#one39">139</a></sup> With regard to extending <cite>Income Tax Act</cite> definitions of &quot;spouse&quot; to include common law spouses, then Attorney General John Crosbie stated that &quot;the impediment to extending equal treatment to common law spouses is that Revenue Canada would be unable to administer a definition of common law spouse with a high degree of accuracy.&quot; <sup><a href="#one40">140</a></sup> Despite this uncertainty, the federal government has recently passed legislation that extends spousal provisions in the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite> to common law spouses. In fact, of the Acts discussed in this paper, only the <cite>Family Law Act</cite>, <cite>Succession Law Reform Act</cite>, and <cite>Immigration Act</cite> continue to contain provisions that exclude common law couples.<sup><a href="#one41">141</a></sup>
<p>
In <cite>Andrews 2</cite>, McRae J. argued that it would be administratively impracticable to extend to same-sex couples benefits that were already available to common law, opposite-sex couples:
<blockquote>
In order to make the scheme under the Act administratively and economically practicable, there needs to be an objective interpretation imposed that will necessarily exclude some persons. Simplicity and administrative convenience are legitimate concerns. ... <sup><a href="#one42">142</a></sup>
</blockquote>
McRae J. did not explain how it is easier to verify the status of a common law relationship than that of a same-sex relationship. This distinction is arbitrary.
<p>
E. SUMMARY
<p>
The <cite>Charter</cite> does afford lesbian and gay litigants protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. However, this protection is undercut markedly by legal reasoning that is informed by homophobic bias. The effect of this limited protection is that in addition to being unprotected against private acts of discrimination in most jurisdictions in Canada,<sup><a href="#one43">143</a></sup> lesbian and gay litigants often are unable to use the <cite>Charter</cite> to challenge successfully government legislation, such as that mentioned in Part I, that discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation.
<p>
The pervasiveness of homophobic judgments attests to the political powerlessness of lesbians and gays and serves as an indication that same-sex spouses represent a serious threat to the established patriarchal social order, at the pinnacle of which are heterosexual men and conventional families. Mary Eaton and Cynthia Petersen, in their critique of the <cite>Andrews 2</cite> &quot;traditional family&quot; s. 1 justification, characterized the patriarchal heterosexist agenda as follows:
<blockquote>
First, the political economy of the family is such that, as a general rule, home-centred labour is performed by women without cash payment. This bolsters the economy as a whole and frees up male labour for use in the public sphere. Second, by performing the functions of child birthing and care, women contribute substantially to the economy by reproducing human capital. Third, the power structure of the nuclear family perpetuates patriarchal domination on a microscopic scale.<sup><a href="#one44">144</a></sup>
</blockquote>
This agenda has become so much the norm that its tenets, heterosexism and sexism, are rarely even questioned by the judiciary. Same-sex couples are, by reflex, attributed characteristics that most often bear no relationship to reality, characteristics that invariably cast these relationships as being either inferior to
opposite-sex relationships or simply non-existent.
<p>
<h3>III.   Strategies for Change</h3>

In order to be accorded equitable treatment, same-sex couples face the challenge of arguing that same-sex relationships are, in fact, legitimate.<sup><a href="#one45">145</a></sup> This can be done in one of two general ways: either maintain that same-sex relationships are &quot;like&quot; opposite-sex relationships, that they possess the qualities traditionally associated with conventional families; or maintain that same-sex relationships are in fact unique, that they are not &quot;like&quot; opposite-sex relationships but nevertheless should be accorded equitable treatment. These two approaches are, on their face, mutually exclusive. One approach argues for inclusion in the sphere of &quot;family,&quot; the other seeks to deconstruct or possibly completely destroy an institution that is argued to be inherently exclusionary and discriminatory. This Part will explore this debate and will suggest that not only can these two approaches be seen as complementary, but that this dilemma can be bypassed somewhat by using &quot;functional&quot; definitions of the word &quot;spouse.&quot;
<p>
A.  TOWARD A NEW IDEOLOGY OF THE FAMILY
<p>
In order to secure the spousal benefits that are available to opposite-sex couples, many same-sex couples assert that same-sex relationships have the same characteristics as those associated with opposite-sex couples. Presumably, many litigants feel that the most effective way to gain the sympathy of a heterosexual society and heterosexual judiciary is to mimic those attributes that our society values. This may be so in the short term, when an individual litigant is before a heterosexist judge. However, such an approach may do less, in the long term, to dismantle the ideology of the conventional family which is responsible for much of the oppression faced by lesbians and gays and other individuals who are not predisposed to conforming to that mold.
<p>
Didi Herman criticizes the fact that almost all same-sex spousal litigation is following this &quot;sameness&quot; route, referring to the <cite>Andrews 2</cite> factum as a case in point: 
<blockquote>
[Karen Andrews and Mary Trenholm] regard themselves and hold themselves out to the community as each other's spouse and intend to continue to live together as each other's spouse. Andrews and Trenholm are each other's sole domestic and sexual partners, own their own home as joint tenants, have their assets in a joint bank account and have named each other as beneficiary under their wills.<sup><a href="#one46">146</a></sup>
</blockquote>
This strategy of arguing &quot;sameness&quot; can be considered to be patently assimilationist. The existence and experience of lesbian and gay and other alternative family forms is marginalized due to the
fact that the only way of obtaining &quot;family&quot; assistance is to conform to the dominant conception of what constitutes a family. Those attributes associated with conventional families, attributes
that are reflected in the <cite>Andrews 2</cite> factum, bear repeating: mutual dependence, stability, nurturing, child-bearing, child-rearing, and monogamy.<sup><a href="#one47">147</a></sup>
<p>
Despite these concerns, it is submitted that such an approach is a productive first step. By being included under the rubric of &quot;family,&quot; same-sex couples will ultimately transform its underlying tenets; although same-sex couples can argue that same-sex relationships are in many ways &quot;the same,&quot; the sexual configuration of same-sex relationships will nevertheless challenge the status quo sufficiently to shift its conception as to what constitutes a &quot;conventional family.&quot;  Only once these underlying tenets are shifted will it become more feasible for same-sex couples to argue that, despite differences that may exist, same-sex couples must nevertheless be accorded equitable treatment.<sup><a href="#one48">148</a></sup> In fact, such arguments are essential in effecting a further shift in the status quo conception of what constitutes an appropriate family unit.<sup><a href="#one49">149</a></sup>
<p>
Some lesbian and gay and feminist theorists argue for a regime that distributes benefits solely on the basis of individual need and entitlement, asserting that the state has no role supporting any sort of family unit. For example, Carol Smart argues that 
<blockquote>
A primary goal must be to jettison the privileged status of the heterosexual married couple, but not in order to create a different hierarchy of <i>unmarried</i> households. The aim is not to extend the legal and social definition of marriage to cover cohabitees or even homosexual couples, it is to abandon the status of marriage altogether and to devise a system of rights, duties, or obligations which are not dependent on any form of <i>coupledom</i> or marriage or quasi-marriage.<sup><a href="#one50">150</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The implicit assertion in this argument is that <i>any</i> family-centred regime that is sanctioned by the state will necessarily be oppressive.
<p>
Although this approach ultimately would put an end to much of the discrimination faced by same-sex partners, it is possible, if not likely, that the withdrawal of state support for family units will result in the decline of the formation of families and hence jeopardize the many positive functions currently performed by
families in our society. Families are a primary vehicle through which religions, languages, and cultures are passed on from generation to generation. This is especially so if the religion, culture, or language in question is shared by a relatively small portion of the population.<sup><a href="#one51">151</a></sup> Familial ties are necessary insofar as they provide some privatization of interpersonal relationships, some sphere within which individuals can make intimate decisions regarding such things as morality and religion.<sup><a href="#one52">152</a></sup>
<p>
Families also serve to protect individuals from more direct or imminent forms of oppression, such as racism and homophobia. In this respect, families again serve a more important function for minority groups. Harriet Michel notes that &quot;family&quot; units were crucial to the survival of black Americans, particularly during the time of
slavery:
<blockquote>
Because slavery often denied us the right to live with our biological kin, our definition of family became any group of individuals who collectively come together in order to provide economic and emotional support to the members of the group.<sup><a href="#one53">153</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Similarly, a &quot;same-sex family&quot;<sup><a href="#one54">154</a></sup> is a lesbian or gay
person's primary refuge in an ideologically heterosexist world.
<p>
Accordingly, the ideology of the family must be deconstructed only insofar as it includes stereotypes concerning such issues as sexuality, gender, dependence, procreation, and monogamy. It is not an institution that needs to be abandoned completely. This partial deconstruction of the conventional family can be achieved by statutorily defining families according to &quot;functional&quot; indicia such as economic and emotional support. Same-sex couples would no longer have to argue that same-sex relationships conform to heterosexist stereotypes in order to qualify for benefits but rather will be able to point to fixed, written criteria that can be evaluated more objectively.<sup><a href="#one55">155</a></sup> In addition, questionable functional criteria that are written can be more easily challenged as being discriminatory, particularly if they are seen to be heterosexually-biased.
<p>
This functional approach can also be used when the statute in question does not define its use of the word &quot;spouse&quot; or &quot;family.&quot;  In <cite>Braschi v. Stahl</cite>, a case dealing with eviction, the New York Court of Appeals ruled a same-sex couple to be the legal equivalent of a family.<sup><a href="#one56">156</a></sup> The Court interpreted the term &quot;family&quot; in the statute in question as
referring not only to the conventional family form but to a plurality of family forms, noting that the &quot;reality of family life&quot; necessitated a broad interpretation of the word. The Court ruled that 
<blockquote>
[T]he term family ... should not be rigidly restricted to those people who have formalized their relationship by obtaining, for instance, a marriage certificate or an adoption order. The intended protection against sudden eviction should not rest on fictitious legal distinctions or genetic history ... (but rather on) ... the exclusivity and longevity of the relationship, the level of emotional and financial commitment. ...<sup><a href="#one57">157</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The Court did not, unlike courts in most cases involving lesbian and gay plaintiffs, defer to heterosexist stereotype, to dictionary definitions of &quot;family,&quot; or to heterosexist definitions of &quot;family&quot; found in other statutes.<sup><a href="#one58">158</a></sup>
<p>
This general approach is also evidenced somewhat in <cite>Knodel</cite>. Although Rowles J. did not go so far as to list new indicia of what constitutes a family, she did accept the following expert evidence that the plaintiff same-sex couple did constitute a &quot;familial unit&quot; for the purpose of the legislation in question. 
<blockquote>
[T]he term &quot;family&quot; does not have one definition for all purposes in Canada. As families evolve in our pluralistic society, the language by which families are described evolves. Dr. Eichler uses the term &quot;familial relationship&quot; to characterize the many kinds of relationships that exist outside of the traditional and legally married family.<sup><a href="#one59">159</a></sup>
</blockquote>
It is unclear whether other Canadian courts will follow Rowles J.'s relatively progressive approach as to what constitutes a family. It is nevertheless desirable that, when advocating for change, a pluralistic conception of family be employed as a means of trying to effect a shift in what our society views as a &quot;proper&quot; family unit.
<p>
B. A NEW DEFINITION OF &quot;SPOUSE&quot;
<p>
A more pluralistic definition of &quot;spouse&quot; should be the cornerstone of any legislative reform in which families are deemed to be the most appropriate unit of appraisal. As discussed above, the adoption of such a definition will be crucial in extending equitable treatment to partners who choose not to marry. The following is an
example of such a definition:
<blockquote>
&quot;Partner&quot; refers to individuals who mutually intend to be partners. Indicia of this intention MAY include, BUT ARE NOT RESTRICTED TO, the following:
<ul>
<li>a marriage certificate
<li>cohabitation and any related arrangements
<li>sharing of financial resources
<li>emotional commitment
<li>length of relationship
<li>co-parenting agreements
<li>self-identification as partners.<sup><a href="#one60">160</a></sup>
</ul></blockquote>
Such a definition has the advantage of emphasizing that partnership and family formation do not necessarily assume the format of the conventional family. It focuses on the intent of the parties to have a partnership rather than rigid and artificial requirements such as the securing of a marriage licence or cohabitation for three years.<sup><a href="#one61">161</a></sup> The word &quot;partner&quot; has been used instead of the word &quot;spouse&quot; to signify this new conception of what constitutes a family. In addition, as will be discussed below, this definition should be made context-specific to satisfy the particularities of different legislative schemes.
<p>
Although it is arguable that the above criteria reflect conventional family norms, it is necessary to provide courts with indicia as to what constitutes a partnership given that it is a relatively new legislative concept. Without any criteria, courts are more likely to equate &quot;an intention to be partners&quot; with &quot;an intention to be spouses&quot; and make use of stereotypes associated with what it means to be a &quot;spouse&quot; and &quot;family&quot; when deciding whether two individuals are partners. In addition, the inclusion of the possibility of polygamous partnerships and the clearly optional nature of these criteria would serve as a clear indication of legislative intent to depart from conventional conceptions of &quot;spouse&quot; and &quot;family.&quot;<sup><a href="#one62">162</a></sup>
<p>
An interesting example of a legislative attempt to accommodate alternative family forms can be found in Ontario's <cite>Consent to Treatment Act</cite>,<sup><a href="#one63">163</a></sup> which allows for a &quot;spouse or partner&quot; to give consent to medical treatment on behalf of an individual who is deemed to be incapable of doing so.<sup><a href="#one64">164</a></sup> The definitions of &quot;spouse&quot; and &quot;partners&quot; in s. 1 of the <cite>Act</cite> are as follows:
<blockquote>
&quot;[S]pouse&quot; means a person of the opposite sex 
<ol type="a">
<li>to whom the person is married, or 
<li>with whom the person is living in a conjugal relationship outside marriage if the two persons, 
<ol type="i">
<li>have cohabited for at least one year, 
<li>are together the parents of a child, OR
<li>have together entered into a cohabitation agreement under section 53 of the <cite>Family Law Act</cite>
</ol></ol>
Two persons are partners for the purpose of this <cite>Act</cite> if they have lived together for at least one year and have a close personal relationship that others recognize is of primary importance in both persons' lives.
</blockquote>
Although this definition is progressive in that it acknowledges other family forms, it is problematic in two general
respects.<sup><a href="#one65">165</a></sup> First, same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples are not treated equally in that same-sex couples cannot be deemed to be partners by co-parenting a child or by entering into a
cohabitation agreement. Second, same-sex couples are put to a higher standard in that same-sex relationships must be &quot;recognized by others.&quot;  This criteria is especially unreasonable for same-sex couples who, due to homophobia, are not only less likely to have their relationship &quot;recognized by others&quot; but are also less likely to cohabit.<sup><a href="#one66">166</a></sup>
<p>
The above definitions are not intended to be examples of what are proper or improper definitions of partners in all cases. Depending on the legislation, it will be necessary to alter this conception of partnership in order to secure equitable application of the particular legislative scheme. For example, in order to be subject to the division of property provisions in most family law legislation, two individuals must be married.<sup><a href="#one67">167</a></sup> It is possible that the legislature may wish to preserve this &quot;opting in&quot; system, in which case the recognition of a partnership could be subject to registration by the parties.<sup><a href="#one68">168</a></sup> In the area of social welfare legislation, a system of individual entitlement would alleviate much of the disadvantage faced by women in need of social assistance.<sup><a href="#one69">169</a></sup> In the area of taxation, it may be more equitable to apply some definition of partnership that reflects the actual economies realized by cohabitation and/or the joining of financial resources. Hence, the definition might emphasize financial interdependence and sharing more than emotional commitment, for
example.
<p>
C. MARRIAGE OR AREA-BY-AREA CHANGES?
<p>
The question regarding same-sex marriages is posed usually from the dominant heterosexist perspective: &quot;Should homosexuals be allowed to enter a legal marriage?&quot;  Although it is unjust to deny lesbians and gays the right to marry, simply answering &quot;yes&quot; to the above question implicitly accepts that the dominant heterosexist perspective about social organization is the only perspective.<sup><a href="#one70">170</a></sup> As Nitya Duclos suggests, it is more empowering, and in fact more productive,
to pose the question from the perspective of lesbians and gays. According to Duclos, the question should be 
<blockquote>
Will lesbians and gay men or some of them benefit from legal recognition and regulation of their relationships through the marriage system?
</blockquote>
Duclos continues by explaining that this phraseology
<blockquote>
puts lesbians and gay men front and center as people with whom and for whom we are concerned. It specifies that legal recognition is one form of recognition and that the issue involves the <i>regulation</i> of those relationships by law. It expressly removes from consideration any doubt that lesbians and gay men have relationships---something the earlier question left open. And it asserts that marriage is a system of legal and social rules, not
elemental but socially constructed and open to change.<sup><a href="#one71">171</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Because marriage does involve a multiplicity of rights, obligations, and legal consequences spanning such various areas of law as social welfare, taxation, and family law, it may be preferable to determine what type of reform would be most advantageous to same-sex couples in each particular area of legislation.<sup><a href="#one72">172</a></sup> Although most of the legislation mentioned in the first part of this article is disadvantageous to same-sex couples, there are areas where most same-sex couples are likely better off. For example, same-sex couples &quot;benefit&quot; from not being considered a viable socio-economic unit in that no income is deemed to be shared by them for income tax purposes or, most often, for the purposes of the &quot;spouse in the house&quot; rule in the administration of social assistance.<sup><a href="#one73">173</a></sup> An area-by-area approach would also allow for the re-evaluation of the tenets of the
specific legislation in question, possibly benefiting other disenfranchised groups who are being treated inequitably by its scheme. For example, the increasing recognition of same-sex relationships may prompt a re-evaluation of the &quot;spouse in the house&quot; rule, which is particularly disadvantageous to women.<sup><a href="#one74">174</a></sup>
<p>
Despite the beneficial aspects of area-by-area reform, the option of marriage should still be available to same-sex couples if it remains available to opposite-sex couples.<sup><a href="#one75">175</a></sup> Most opposition to this prospect centres around the conception that entry or advocating entry into a heterosexual-dominated institution will prompt conformation with its norms. Examples of this are Karen Andrews arguing &quot;sameness&quot; in
order to get a spousal benefit, and lesbian and gay advocates arguing for the right to marry on the grounds that their family units conform to criteria similar to those of opposite-sex family units. 
<p>
Although these concerns have merit, there are countervailing benefits that may result from same-sex couples obtaining the right to marry. First, it is arguable that securing a marriage licence may in fact decrease the need for same-sex couples to employ sameness arguments to secure the rights available to opposite-sex couples. A marriage
certificate will automatically entitle a same-sex couple to various benefits, possibly restricting &quot;sameness&quot; arguments to areas where judicial discretion, and hence possibly prejudice, remain, for
example in the realm of child custody disputes.<sup><a href="#one76">176</a></sup> Without the option of obtaining a marriage certificate, gays and lesbians would be more subject to judicial discretion as to what constitutes a &quot;family&quot; or what constitutes a &quot;spouse&quot; and hence more likely to employ sameness arguments. In addition, it must be realized that not marrying is in no way an inoculation against conformity. For example, both lesbian couples in <cite>Andrews 2</cite> and <cite>Anderson v. Luoma</cite>, aside from their sexual orientation, already conformed to what can be considered the &quot;norm.&quot;<sup><a href="#one77">177</a></sup>
<p>
Second, advocating the right to marry can serve as the catalyst that forces society to re-evaluate the heterosexist bias not only of marriage but of most other social institutions as well. Although marriage is often characterized as a static, heterosexist, male-dominated institution, it can also be seen as an evolving institution that adapts to changes in social norms, an institution capable of accommodating same-sex couples.<sup><a href="#one78">178</a></sup> The sanctioning of same-sex relationships by the state would imply a high degree of
social legitimation of these relationships. Although this might be thought inherently repugnant and unnecessary by many lesbian and gay theorists, such legitimation can be quite effective in dismantling judicial, legislative, and social prejudice and the characterization of same-sex relationships as being inferior to opposite-sex relationships.
<p>
D. SUMMARY
<p>
Initially, same-sex couples will most easily achieve equal treatment by employing sameness arguments. Despite the
assimilationist nature of these arguments, the concept of the traditional family nevertheless will shift simply by virtue of same-sex couples arguing for equality and being included within the concept of family. Once this begins to occur, lesbian and gay advocates will be able to argue more productively for equal treatment without ignoring, or perhaps concealing, the ways in which lesbian and gay relationships are unique.
<p>
It is acknowledged that it is impossible to embrace reforms that satisfy all cultural particularities and ideological perspectives. The above suggestions are intended to serve as a middle ground between those who advocate sameness and those, on the other extreme, who advocate the dismantling of the concept of family. Sameness
arguments are valuable in that they argue for inclusion in an institution that can be seen as evolving and capable of fundamental change. Those who argue for the dismantling of &quot;the family&quot; contribute to the debate by accelerating the critical evaluation, and hence reform, of an institution that is inherently exclusionary and discriminatory. It is hoped that this debate will help bring about legal reforms which recognize same-sex marriages and which adopt more pluralistic definitions of &quot;spouse&quot; that would apply to couples who choose not to marry.
<p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

The scope of the discrimination faced by same-sex couples attests to the firm entrenchment of male-heterosexist privilege in our society. This privilege accounts for the existence of laws that benefit the conventional family form. The threat to this privilege accounts for many badly written, discriminatory judgments that incorporate outdated legal reasoning, as well as for the almost resolute unwillingness of governments to amend heterosexist legislation. Homophobic judgments and legislation serve to perpetuate dichotomies that ascribe certain &quot;inferior&quot;
characteristics to same-sex couples and other relatively &quot;superior&quot; characteristics to opposite-sex couples.
<p>
The conclusions that flow from same-sex couples being &quot;bad&quot; are numerous. Same-sex couples are denied financial assistance in the areas of health care, pensions, workers' compensation, and income tax. Same-sex couples cannot take advantage of state planning schemes respecting property division, intestacy, and spousal support. Same-sex families often cannot even form or function due to the inability to obtain leave from work, sponsor a partner for immigration purposes, or obtain the unrestricted custody of children. In most Canadian jurisdictions, same-sex couples are not protected against any private acts of discrimination. In those jurisdictions
where there is protection, it is usually restricted to discrimination relating to the provision of services, accommodation, and employment. Because same-sex couples are labeled &quot;bad,&quot; they are denied tools
available to opposite-sex couples that aid in the formation of viable family units. 
<p>
It is most likely that this inequity will be redressed through <cite>Charter</cite> litigation. Despite the prevalence of homophobic judgments and unsatisfactory legal reasoning, the majority of recent legal reforms in this area have emanated from court challenges. Yet, to the extent that representation on the judiciary continues to represent male heterosexual privilege, same-sex spousal claimants will continue to encounter impediments such as &quot;similarly-situated&quot; arguments and dictionary-definition justifications.
<p>
Because of this intransigence, those advocating for change must be clear regarding different strategies that have been proposed as a means of furthering lesbian and gay rights. Possibly the most prominent debate has revolved around the issue of whether same-sex couples should argue for inclusion in the conventional notion of family and hence transform it from within, or whether same-sex couples should aim to dismantle this inherently heterosexist
institution from without. As was suggested in Part III, one approach does not necessarily preclude the other. Although sameness or inclusion arguments would be more productive in effecting an initial shift in the status quo conception of family, both approaches contribute to the deconstruction of the oppressive tenets of the conventional family and to the acceptance of a more universal conception of family.
<p>
Ultimately, pluralistic definitions of family will be not only recognized statutorily, but also accepted intimately by most Canadians, including the judiciary. Although the discrimination discussed in this article is pervasive, several prominent lesbian and gay rights cases in the past decade indicate a possible shift away from this legacy of entrenched homophobia. It is to be hoped that this trend will continue and evolve to the point where lesbian and
gay families are able to participate fully in Canadian society.

<p>
<li><a name="one">The term</a> &quot;functional family&quot; is meant to be an inclusive term that refers to individuals who unite for purposes <i>such as</i> childbearing, child rearing, emotional support, financial support, and cohabitation. (The concept of a &quot;functional family&quot; is discussed further in Part III.)  In contrast, the term &quot;conventional family&quot; refers to a family unit in which there are a man and a woman who typically are married and who typically have children. According to this conventional stereotype, it is usually the man who engages in paid employment and the woman who performs unpaid house and child-rearing work.  &quot;Ideally&quot; this family is also white and middle-class. It is important to note that the term &quot;conventional family&quot; is used instead of the more common &quot;traditional family&quot; as a means of challenging the presupposition that families have always conformed to what is now the dominant family form. In fact, it is arguable that the current dominant conception of family extends only as far back as Judeo-Christianity itself. See D. Greenberg, <cite>The Construction of Homosexuality</cite> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988).
<p>
<li><a name="two">The implicit</a> assumption in this article is that political/social change and legislative change happen concurrently and reinforce one another. Changing social conceptions of what constitutes an appropriate family spur legislative change and <i>vice versa</i>.

<li><a name="three">The footnotes</a> to this article should serve as an invitation to the reader to explore further the issues discussed. This article contributes to the existing scholarship by focusing its discussion of discrimination on the following issues: (1) how resistance to lesbian and gay liberation can be seen as an attempt to safeguard a male-dominated, heterosexist social order; (2) the way in which difference theory is used to perpetuate this discrimination; (3) how judicial prejudice has undercut protection afforded by the <cite>Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms</cite> (see <i>infra</i> note 83); (4) strategies lesbian and gay activists can employ when advocating for change; and (5) how this debate contributes to the evolution of the concept of &quot;family.&quot;  It should also be noted, at the outset, that all of the articles, judgments, and texts referred to in this article reflect, at least to some extent, the perspectives of the individual writers. Although my perspective as a gay man is relevant to the discussion offered in this article, it is by no means determinative. As within any other group, there is wide divergence within the lesbian and gay community as to how these issues can best be resolved. This divergence will be highlighted in Part III.

Southey J. ruled that, according to the common law, two people of the same sex could not marry. In contrast, Greer J.'s dissent highlights the evolving nature of the common law:
<blockquote>
One of the questions the Court was being asked to consider was whether there was a common law prohibition against same-sex marriages. The object of the common law is to solve difficulties and adjust relations in social and commercial life. It must meet, so far as it can, sets of fact abnormal as well as usual. It must grow with the development of the nation. It must face and deal with changing or novel circumstances. Unless it can do that it fails in its function and declines in its dignity and value. An expanding society demands an expanding common law. 
<p>
That the common law expands to meet social needs is not a new concept. The above words were written by McCardie J. of the King's Bench Division in a 1924 sale of goods case, <cite>Prager v. Blatspiel, Stamp and Heacock, Ltd.</cite>, [1924] 1 K.B. 566 at 570. The common law does not remain static. Its very essence is that it is able to grow to meet the expanding needs of society.

<li><a name="thirteen">For example,</a> the <cite>Family Law Act</cite>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, defines &quot;spouse&quot; in ss 1(1) and 29 as &quot;either of a man and woman who are married to each other&quot; and &quot;either of a man and woman who are not married to each other and have cohabited (a) continuously for a
period of not less than three years.&quot;  It is interesting to note that an opposite-sex requirement is superimposed on the marriage requirement. Given the inability of same-sex couples to marry, it is not clear why this added requirement is necessary.
<p>
<li><a name="fourteen">For example,</a> the regulations to the <cite>Health Insurance Act</cite> (R.R.O. 1980, Reg. 452, s. 1(c)), which formed the basis of the <cite>Andrews 2</cite> case (<i>supra</i> note 12) define &quot;dependant&quot; as &quot;the spouse of an insured person,&quot; with no subsequent definition of the word &quot;spouse.&quot;
<p>
<li><a name="fifteen">For example,</a> in <cite>Andrews 2</cite>, <i>supra</i> note 12 at 261, McRae J. states that &quot;in approximately 79 statutes in Ontario where the word `spouse' is used it always refers to a person of the opposite sex. . . . I have been referred to and have resorted to a number of dictionaries among them---Black's Law Dictionary, The Oxford Dictionary, Jowitts Dictionary of English Law, the Random House Dictionary and others. All define spouse as an opposite sex partner.&quot;

blackmail), largely as a result of U.S. government lobbying. Girard states that although this may have been a valid concern (although not necessarily a valid justification) in the 1950s, increasing focus on the law's discriminatory nature and stigmatizing effect (&quot;homosexuals&quot; were grouped with prostitutes, beggars, pimps, and vagrants, for example) resulted in its amendment in 1976.

With regard to whether sexual orientation is a prohibited ground of discrimination under the <cite>Charter</cite>, see Part III, Section A.

McIntosh notes that, although an application may be brought on &quot;humanitarian and compassionate grounds,&quot; the prospects of an immigration official admitting a lesbian or gay partner into Canada on this basis is highly unlikely
given the fact that the prohibition against lesbian and gay immigrants was removed from the <cite>Immigration Act</cite> only in 1976. Nevertheless, at least one lawyer, Mary Joseph of Toronto, has been successful in advancing the immigration claims of her clients using this ground (M.

Amendments to this regulation, which were passed in 1986 and 1987, narrowed this definition so as to allow less administrative discretion when determining whether individuals were spouses for the purposes of attribution (R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 366, s. 1). For example, s. 1(2) now directs that &quot;sexual factors shall not be investigated or considered.&quot; Nevertheless, the new regulations still leave much room for the use of stereotype when ascertaining whether or not income should be attributed.

As Ryder notes, <i>supra</i> note 11 at 59, the reluctance of courts to grant custody to parents in a
same-sex relationship is in sharp contrast with the courts' increased willingness to grant custody to the parent who is involved in an opposite-sex relationship, irrespective of whether they are married.

Council and Court: Prospects in <cite>Lockerbie</cite> for an International Rule of Law <a href="#note">*</a></h1>

<i>With the Cold War's demise, the Security Council now enjoys powers formerly checked by reciprocal vetos. The
first test of this new ascendancy came via a Libyan application to the International Court of Justice in 1992. At stake was the validity of two Security Council resolutions which responded to the destruction of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. On 14 April 1992, the Court declined Libya's request for provisional relief. This article construes the Court's Order as highlighting the need for a system of judicial review within the United Nations. Such
a system would likely have led the Court to a different decision in</i> Lockerbie<i>. The legitimate activity of all United Nations organs is limited. Constraints are informed in part by what is termed an international rule of law, which in the last resort mandates oversight of these constraints by the Court. The proposal advanced by the author would grant the Court a broad power of</i> certiorari<i> tempered by deferential standards of review.
<p>
Avec la fin de la guerre froide, le Conseil de s&eacute;curit&eacute; peut employer des pouvoirs autrefois bloqu&eacute;s par des v&eacute;tos de r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;. Cette nouvelle ascension a &eacute;t&eacute; mise &agrave; l'&eacute;preuve pour la premi&egrave;re fois par une demande libyenne &agrave; la Cour internationale de justice en 1992. Cette demande remettait en question la validit&eacute; de deux r&eacute;solutions du Conseil de s&eacute;curit&eacute; li&eacute;es &agrave; la destruction du vol Pan Am 103 au-dessus de Lockerbie en &eacute;cosse. Le 14 avril 1992, la Cour a rejet&eacute; la demande libyenne de secours provisoire. Cet article interpr&egrave;te la d&eacute;cision de la Cour comme l'expression de la necessit&eacute; d'un syst&egrave;me d'examen judiciaire &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur m&ecirc;me des Nations unies. Un tel syst&egrave;me aurait probablement men&eacute; &agrave; une d&eacute;cision diff&eacute;rente dans l'affaire </i>Lockerbie<i>. Les activit&eacute;s l&eacute;gitimes de tous les organes des Nations unies sont limit&eacute;es. Ils se trouvent contraints par ce qu'on appelle l'autorit&eacute; international de la loi, qui, en dernier ressort, exige que la Cour passe outre &agrave; ces contraintes. La proposition de l'auteur donnerait &agrave; la Cour un large pouvoir de </i><b>certiorari</b><i>, temp&eacute;r&eacute; par un comportement de d&eacute;f&eacute;rence lors de l'examen judiciaire.</i>
<p>
<h3>I. Introduction</h3>

In 1890, William Edward Hall observed that, over the centuries, international law progressed in fifty-year intervals,
emerging in a more solid position at the end of each period than that which it occupied at the beginning.<sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup> While he predicted that the world would still engage in great wars, he concluded that the international system would, after each conflict, atone by embracing &quot;straighter obligations than those which it before acknowledged.&quot;<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup> The twentieth century has been kind to Hall's thesis. First at Versailles, then at San Francisco, we have increasingly sought to consolidate the yields of peace by agreeing to strict measures for international governance.
<p>
Nearly fifty years after San Francisco, we witness the demise of another war. With it has come the collapse of the Soviet Union, freedom in Eastern and Baltic Europe, a reunified Germany, and the possibility of Middle Eastern peace. These events have inspired a renewed scrutiny of the mechanisms and principles that shape the international community.<sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup> They have also changed the dynamic within existing structures. In this flux, the United Nations seeks to confirm its efficacy as an instrument of dispute resolution and peace making.<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup> As a result, the United Nations Security Council is only now invoking the full powers that were accorded it in 1945, but that the Cold War had paralysed through a pattern of reciprocal vetos. Given this Security Council ascendancy, it was only a matter of time before a member state questioned anew the limits of the Council's competence.
<p>
That state proved to be Libya. Held responsible for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, and on the receiving end of two Security Council resolutions demanding extradition of two accused, Libya applied to the International Court of Justice for a vindication of what it claimed were violated treaty rights. Pending the Court's
disposition of the application, Libya also requested provisional relief to enjoin any coercion. The application to the Court was widely regarded as a desperate and cynical example of a state trying to evade responsibility for its terrorist acts. Whether this conclusion was justified or not, the fascinating questions raised by the case remind us that even inglorious claimants can raise worthwhile issues.<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup>
<p>
The decision by which the Court declined to indicate provisional measures<sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup> has variously been praised as potentially &quot;the most important and jurisprudentially rich of any handed down by this Court since the end of the Cold War&quot;<sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup> and criticized as
&quot;another blow&quot;<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup> to respect for the Court and perhaps &quot;a tombstone to the premature end to the `New World Order'.&quot;<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup> The case presented an extraordinary situation arising from the simultaneous treatment of a dispute by the Security Council and the Court. Before this case, their concomitant exercise of concurrent but not exclusive powers had not given rise to serious
problems. The Pan Am 103 dispute, however, presented new challenges through the possibility of inconsistent decisions between the two organs. <cite>Lockerbie</cite> therefore provided a rare opportunity to confront directly the relationship between the Security Council and the Court, a relationship still not fully defined, thanks largely to
Cold War tensions.
<p>
I will suggest that most of the majority and dissenting opinions disappoint in their failure to give adequate consideration to the constitutional questions of <cite>Lockerbie</cite>, and that provisional measures should likely have been indicated. By not construing the United Nations Charter as an international constitution, the judgments leave ambiguous whether or not the Security Council---as distinct from the Charter---is above or beyond the reach of the Court.<sup><a href="#ten">10</a></sup> It is true that the application was only preliminary, and clearly some allowance must be made for a decision not on the merits. Yet we ought not to allow the possibility of a hypothetical merits stage to excuse an insufficiently nuanced verdict at the provisional stage. If indeed <cite>Lockerbie</cite> proceeds to its merits, the dispute may well have been resolved by the United Nations sanctions now in place or even by the use of force.<sup><a href="#eleven">11</a></sup> If the case does not proceed to its merits, then the decision on interim measures will be the Court's last word on the matter. For this reason, it is proper to ask whether the Court brought the appropriate level of rigour, even at the provisional stage, to its analysis.
<p>
Unfortunately, the Court's denial of provisional measures turned on the inflexibly formal observation that the Security Council had acted under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.<sup><a href="#twelve">12</a></sup> Article 25 of the Charter renders Council decisions under Chapter VII obligatory, and by Article 103 all Charter obligations trump those arising under any other international arrangement. By this simple reasoning, the Court threatened to preclude, &quot;in blanket fashion, the exercise of judicial jurisdiction <i>whenever</i> and <i>simply because</i> the Council is in a chapter VII decision mode.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup> It also allowed the Court to postpone the formulation of a coherent theory with which to resolve future conflicts; the majority did not need such a theory, and the dissenting judges did not suggest a viable alternative.
<p>
This article, using <cite>Lockerbie</cite> as a vehicle, will explore the relationship between the United Nations Security Council and the International Court of Justice, and the prospects for what I will call an international rule of law for these two organs. What I hope to show is that a commitment to this rule of law necessitates a limited system of judicial review within the United Nations. This system affirms the Court as the ultimate safeguard against patently unreasonable violations of institutional competence and principles of general or customary international law.

<h3>II.   Background</h3>

1. PAN AM 103
<p>
On the evening of 21 December 1988, Pan American Airliner 103 departed London Heathrow bound for New York. The <cite>Maid of the Seas</cite>' flight ended thirty-eight minutes later, when the Boeing 747 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 passengers and crew on board and a further 11 local residents on the ground.
Investigations into the cause of the explosion began immediately. Following the questioning of 14 000 individuals in 50 countries and after hours of forensic analysis, suspicion focused on Syrian and Iranian complicity: the bomb was of a type used by a Syrian-based terrorist group backed by Iran.<sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup> Theories abounded that the bombing retaliated for the downing of an Iranian airbus by U.S. Navy warship <cite>Vincennes</cite> on 3 July 1988.<sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup> By mid-1990, however, attention shifted.<sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup> An inch-by-inch search of the 845-square-mile area surrounding the crash site yielded fragments of the bomb's timing device that led investigators toward Libya.<sup><a href="#seventeen">17</a></sup>
<p>
On 14 November 1991, three years after the bombing, a United States federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., indicted two Libyan nationals---Abdel Baset Ali Mohamed al-Megrahi and Al Amin Khalife Fhimah<sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup> ---on charges of having caused the bomb to be placed on Pan Am 103. The 193-count indictment identified the two accused as officials of Libyan Arab Airlines and members of Libya's intelligence organization. Simultaneous charges were laid by the Lord Advocate of Scotland against the two men for conspiracy, murder, and contravention of the <cite>Aviation Security Act</cite> of 1982.<sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a></sup> The two were alleged to have placed the bomb or caused it to have been placed on board Air Malta Flight KM180 from Luqa Airport, Malta, to Frankfurt's Main Airport. Several ounces of Semtex plastic explosives had allegedly been concealed within a Toshiba radio cassette player and placed in a bronze-coloured Samsonite suitcase filled with clothes. This suitcase
had then been transferred without further inspection to cargo container AVE 4041 PA on Pan American flight PA 103A to Heathrow.<sup><a href="#twenty">20</a></sup> In London, baggage handlers stowed the container in a forward cargo bay of flight 103 bound for New York, John F. Kennedy Airport.<sup><a href="#twenty1">21</a></sup>
<p>
Both American and British statements asserted that a mosaic of physical evidence revealed Libyan state responsibility.<sup><a href="#twenty2">22</a></sup> Libya immediately denied the American and
British charges, and suggested that they be submitted to the International Court of Justice or some other neutral body for adjudication. The U.S. State Department rejected the suggestion outright, saying that (a) the indictments were a matter for United States courts to settle;<sup><a href="#twenty3">23</a></sup> (b) no competent international tribunal existed to try the accused; and (c) the Libyan government could not be
expected to prosecute vigorously the agents it ordered to carry out the deed.<sup><a href="#twenty4">24</a></sup> Less than one week after the American and British charges, Libyan Supreme Court Justice Ahmed al-Taher al-Zawi was named by Libya to conduct an inquiry into the allegations. The Libyan government confirmed its judiciary's readiness to cooperate with all legal authorities in the United States and the United Kingdom. It also announced the appointment of a new intelligence chief, perceived by some as a sign that the Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi government was anxious to dispel charges that its security agencies engaged in terrorism.
<p>
On 27 November 1991, the United States and the United Kingdom issued joint statements, demanding the surrender of the two indicted Libyan nationals, and repeating that Libya must take &quot;responsibility
for the actions of Libyan officials.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty5">25</a></sup> They also demanded
compensation for the bombing and for the production of witnesses and evidence for the case.<sup><a href="#twenty6">26</a></sup> In response, the Libyan government issued a communiqu&eacute;, stating that the application would be dealt with seriously and in accordance with principles of international law.
Judge al-Zawi announced that the two Libyan suspects had been placed under house arrest, were being questioned, and would face the death penalty if convicted. He also ruled out handing the suspects over to
Britain or any other country for trial; however, Judge al-Zawi did request the assistance of American and British authorities, offering to travel to these countries to review evidence and to cooperate with his counterparts. He also proposed a meeting of legal experts from the two countries and Libya to aid his investigation. None of his proposals received any response.<sup><a href="#twenty7">27</a></sup> At the same time, Ali Treiki, Libyan delegate to the Arab League, indicated that his government would accept a judge nominated by the United Nations to decide the fate of the two suspects.<sup><a href="#twenty8">28</a></sup>
<p>
Unsatisfied with these responses, the United States, France,<sup><a href="#twenty9">29</a></sup> and the United Kingdom agreed in December 1991 to begin a campaign to win international support for sanctions against Libya.<sup><a href="#thirty">30</a></sup> Just over one week later the United States rejected Libya's invitation for the West to send judges to the trial of the two accused.<sup><a href="#thirty1">31</a></sup> On 2 January 1992, these three Western powers sent their ambassadors to put their case in the capitals of the twelve other member countries of the Security Council. Initial preference among the United States, the United Kingdom, and France had been to impose trade penalties immediately. After sounding out other Security Council members, though, they opted for a slower step-by-step approach.<sup><a href="#thirty2">32</a></sup> The United States' representative to the United Nations, Thomas R. Pickering, was reported to have advised the Bush Administration that to achieve its objectives in the Security Council, the United States would have to mount a diplomatic campaign of intensity comparable to that of the Persian Gulf crisis. The three allies were said to have postponed their campaign after calculating that changes in the roster of the Security Council would make the body more sympathetic to their plans after January 1992. At that time, Cuba, the Ivory Coast, Romania, Yemen, and Zaire were to leave the Council and be replaced by Venezuela, Japan, Morocco, Cape Verde, and Hungary. With Japan having assumed one of the seats reserved for African and Asian states, the number of Council members belonging to the so-called non-aligned movement fell from seven to six. As a consequence, with only nine votes necessary to adopt a resolution, the non-aligned nations could no longer prevent the adoption of resolutions by the fifteen-member Council.<sup><a href="#thirty3">33</a></sup>
<p>
In letters dated 17 January 1992, Ibrahim Mohammed Elbushari, Libya's Secretary of the People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation, notified James A. Baker, U.S. Secretary of State, and Douglas Hurd, U.K. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, that all three countries were parties to the 1971 <cite>Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation</cite><sup><a href="#thirty4">34</a></sup> and that Libya had complied with all its obligations under that convention. Elbushari's letter, issued under Article 14(1) of the Montreal Convention, requested arbitration of the dispute. Neither the United States nor Britain acceded to this request.
<p>
2. SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 731 (1992)
<p>
After two months of intense diplomatic efforts, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 731 (1992).<sup><a href="#thirty5">35</a></sup> It confirmed that the Security Council, determined to eliminate international terrorism,
<ol>
<li><i>Condemns</i> the destruction of Pan American flight 103 ... and the resultant loss of hundreds of
lives;
<li><i>Strongly deplores</i> the fact that the Libyan Government has not yet responded effectively to the above requests [by the United States and the United Kingdom] to cooperate fully in establishing responsibility for the terrorist acts ... against Pan American flight 103 ... ; [and]
<li><i>Urges</i> the Libyan Government immediately to provide a full and effective response to those requests so as to contribute to the elimination of international terrorism; ... .<sup><a href="#thirty6">36</a></sup>
</ol>
Resolution 731 (1992) was particularly noteworthy in two respects. It represented the first time that the Security Council had been asked to call for the extradition of the citizens of one country to stand trial in another. It also marked the first occasion that the Security Council had given implicit support to accusations of state-sponsored terrorism against a member government of the United Nations.<sup><a href="#thirty7">37</a></sup> Libya responded to the resolution with disinformation. On 11 February 1992, for example, Qaddafi was reported to be planning an announcement that the two suspects had disappeared and may have been executed.<sup><a href="#thirty8">38</a></sup>
<p>
3. REFERENCE OF DISPUTE BY LIBYA TO INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE
<p>
On 3 March 1992 Libya instituted proceedings in the International Court of Justice against the United States of America and the United Kingdom in respect of &quot;a dispute ... between Libya and the United States over the interpretation or application of the Montreal Convention.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty9">39</a></sup> The Court was asked to adjudge and declare the following:
<ol type="a">
<li>that Libya has fully complied with all of its obligations under the Montreal Convention;
<li>that the United States and the United Kingdom have breached, and are continuing to breach, their legal obligations to Libya under Article 5(2), 5(3), 7, 8(2) and 11 of the Montreal Convention; and
<li>that the United States and the United Kingdom are under a legal obligation immediately to cease and desist from such breaches and from the use of any and all force or threats against Libya, including the threat of force against Libya, and from all violations of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the political independence of Libya.
</ol>
Libya also asked the Court to indicate provisional measures as follows:
<ol type="a">
<li>to enjoin the United States from taking any action against Libya calculated to coerce or to compel Libya to
surrender the accused individuals to any jurisdiction outside of Libya; and
<li>to ensure that no steps are taken that would prejudice in any way the rights of Libya with respect to the legal proceedings that are the subject of Libya's application.
</ol>
Parallel with its application to the Court, Libya offered to hand the two accused to a neutral country for trial.<sup><a href="#forty">40</a></sup> The United States on the following day dismissed the offer, characterizing it as a delaying tactic. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler did regard the
gesture, however, as an admission that Libya recognized its ability to surrender Libyan nationals.<sup><a href="#forty1">41</a></sup> On 23 March 1992, Libya made a new offer to hand the two accused Libyans over to the Arab League.<sup><a href="#forty2">42</a></sup>
<p>
4. PLEADINGS BEFORE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE
<p>
During oral pleadings on Libya's application to the Court, the litigants advanced two sets of arguments, one relating to the Montreal Convention and Libya's request for interim measures, and the other pertaining to the relationship between the Security Council and the Court. On the first set, the United States and the United Kingdom contended the following points, each of which was contested by Libya: (a) that Libya had failed to provide the Court <i>prima facie</i> jurisdiction due to the absence of a &quot;dispute&quot;; (b) that, if such a &quot;dispute&quot; existed, Libya had failed to show that it could not be settled through negotiation; (c) that even if the &quot;dispute&quot; could not be resolved through negotiation, Libya's request for arbitration was inadequate; (d) that even if the request for arbitration had been adequate, the matter had been brought prematurely with respect to the six-month period in Article 14(1) of the Montreal Convention; (e) that there was no nexus between the rights sought to be protected and
the provisional measures requested; (f) that there was insufficient urgency to warrant interim protection; and (g) that a failure to indicate interim measures would not result in irreparable harm to the Applicant.
<p>
On the second set of submissions, pertaining to the relationship between the Security Council and the Court, the United Kingdom argued that Libya's request for interim measures should be denied because it was intended merely to fetter the Security Council in the exercise of its powers and to preclude it from broadening its action to include
Libya as a state actor in terrorism. The United States asserted that the Court should decline provisional measures simply because the Security Council was already seized of the matter. 
<p>
5. SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 748 (1992)
<p>
Unsatisfied with the Libyan response to resolution 731 (1992), the United States, the United Kingdom, and France opted to elevate the matter into Chapter VII of the Charter and to threaten Libya with economic sanctions if it continued to refuse to extradite the two accused. China indicated its opposition to sanctions against individual countries. After voicing this position, China was advised by the United States, Britain, and France that it would risk losing trade preferences from the United States and seriously impair relations with the other two countries were Beijing to veto a resolution on the sanctions.<sup><a href="#forty3">43</a></sup> The Security Council passed resolution 748 (1992) on 31 March 1992, by a margin of 10 votes to 0.<sup><a href="#forty4">44</a></sup> Five countries, including China, abstained. The resolution reaffirmed resolution 731 (1992) and continued as follows:
<blockquote>
<i>Determining</i> ... that the failure by the Libyan Government to demonstrate by concrete actions its renunciation of terrorism and in particular its continued failure to respond fully and effectively to the requests in
resolution 731 (1992) constitute a threat to international peace and security, ...
<p>
<i>Acting</i> under Chapter VII of the Charter,
<ol>
<li><i>Decides</i> that the Libyan Government must now comply without any further delay with paragraph 3 of resolution 731 (1992) ...
<li><i>Decides also</i> that the Libyan Government must commit itself definitively to cease all forms of terrorist action and all assistance to terrorist groups and that it must promptly, by concrete actions, demonstrate its renunciation of terrorism; [and]
<li><i>Decides</i> that, on 15 April 1992 all States shall adopt the measures set out below, which shall apply until the Security Council decides that the Libyan Government has complied with paragraphs 1 and 2 above; ... .<sup><a href="#forty5">45</a></sup>
</ol></blockquote>
Although resolution 748 (1992) was passed three days after the completion of oral submissions at the International Court of Justice, the parties were nevertheless invited to return and make submissions on the resolution. Both respondents submitted that, because the resolution bound Libya, it precluded any conflicting order by the Court. Libya, conversely, submitted that because no hierarchy existed between the Security Council and Court within the United Nations, and because each exercised its own competence, the risk of conflicting decisions by the two bodies did not render the Libyan claim inadmissible. Libya regarded both resolutions as contrary to international law, and criticized the Security Council's invocation of Chapter VII as a pretext to elude application of the Montreal Convention.
<p>
On 4 April 1992, Qaddafi rejected the United Nations' renewed demands that the two accused be handed over.<sup><a href="#forty6">46</a></sup> Two weeks later, Ibrahim Lagwell, counsel for the two accused,
indicated that they would be willing to go to trial in the West if they were given guarantees that the trial would be
fair.<sup><a href="#forty7">47</a></sup> The dispute took another turn when the International Court of Justice
ruled on Libya's application for interim relief on 14 April 1992.
<p>
<h3>III.   Judgments by International Court of Justice</h3>

1. ORDER OF THE COURT
<p>
By 11 votes to 5,<sup><a href="#forty8">48</a></sup> the Court held that the circumstances of the
cases did not require the exercise of its power under Article 41 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice<sup><a href="#forty9">49</a></sup> to indicate provisional measures. The operative component of the terse Order lies in paragraphs 41 through 45 inclusive. The Court first noted that under Article 41 it could not make definitive findings either of fact or of law on the issues relating to the merits; the Court's Order therefore did not
affect the parties' rights to contest such issues at the stage of the merits. The Order's key paragraph<sup><a href="#fifty">50</a></sup> then noted
<blockquote>
[that] both Libya and the United States, as Members of the United Nations, are obliged to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council in accordance with Article 25 of the Charter; ... [that] <i>prima facie</i> this obligation extends to the decision contained in resolution 748 (1992); and ... [that] in accordance with Article 103 of the Charter, the obligations of the Parties in that respect prevail over their obligations under any other international agreement, including the Montreal Convention ...<sup><a href="#fifty1">51</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Therefore it was regarded as inappropriate to protect the rights claimed by Libya under the Montreal Convention through provisional measures. To the contrary, the Court feared that such protection would likely impair the rights that <i>prima facie</i> were enjoyed by the United States by virtue of resolution 748 (1992). In declining to indicate provisional measures, the Court reiterated that it had not been called on to determine the question of its
jurisdiction to entertain the merits of the case; the rights of the Government of Libya and the Government of the United States to submit arguments in respect of this point at the merits stage therefore emerged unaffected from the Order.<sup><a href="#fifty2">52</a></sup>
<p>
Given the brief Order by the Court, one must look to the separate and particularly to the dissenting opinions for discussion of the most juridically rich aspects of the case. Indeed, only 3 of the 11 majority judges adopted the majority opinion without comment,<sup><a href="#fifty3">53</a></sup> the other 8 indicating one level of displeasure or another with the matters before the Court. The remaining 5 judges each wrote dissenting opinions.
<p>
2. THE CONCURRING DECLARATIONS AND OPINIONS
<p>
Most of the concurring judgments aimed to broaden the basis of the Order beyond resolution 748 (1992). A failure to rely (at least implicitly) on resolution 731 (1992) risked the perception that without the later resolution the Court would have indicated provisional measures. This in turn would have implied a willingness by the Court to reach a decision incompatible with the actions of the Security Council. Acting President Oda therefore felt that provisional measures should have been declined due to a &quot;mismatch&quot; between the Application and the rights that Libya sought to protect.<sup><a href="#fifty4">54</a></sup> Judge Ni would have denied provisional measures on the basis that the temporal requirement of the Montreal Convention had not been met.<sup><a href="#fifty5">55</a></sup> The joint declaration by Judges Evensen, Tarassov, Guillaume, and Aguilar Mawdsley agreed fully with the Order and gave only additional comments.
<p>
By contrast, Judge Lachs emphasized that the Court and the Security Council should each perform their functions without prejudicing the exercise of the other's powers. While he felt that the two organs ought therefore to work in harmony, he added interestingly that they were not to act &quot;in concert.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty6">56</a></sup> The failure to indicate measures, he concluded, was not an abdication of the Court's powers but a reflection of the system within which the Court is meant to render justice. Judge Shahabuddeen, however, gave a separate opinion that reluctantly endorsed the Order. Without resolution 748 (1992), he suggested that Libya's application would have been allowed. Because of the Security Council's action, though, the Court had no choice but to take account of resolution 748 (1992) in finding the applicable law. With the resolution presumed to be valid, Articles 25 and 103 of the Charter rendered unenforceable whatever rights Libya might formerly have held. Although he maintained that no imposition of superior authority had taken place, his opinion included a series of questions that go to the heart of the dispute:
<blockquote>
Are there any limits to the Council's powers of appreciation? In the equilibrium of forces underpinning the structure of the United Nations within the evolving international order, is there any conceivable point beyond which a legal issue may properly arise as to the competence of the Security Council to produce such overriding results? If there are any limits, what are those limits and what body, if other than the Security Council, is competent to say what
those limits are?<sup><a href="#fifty7">57</a></sup>
</blockquote>
3.  THE DISSENTING OPINIONS
<p>
Each of the five dissenting judges wrote independent opinions, and each found that the circumstances justified the
exercise of the Court's power to indicate provisional measures. All noted the organic but autonomous nature of United Nations organs. They agreed that this autonomy rendered it fully appropriate for the Security Council and the Court to be seized simultaneously with the same matter. Indeed, they noted that the jurisdictions of the two organs had already been invoked concurrently in several prominent cases.<sup><a href="#fifty8">58</a></sup> However, the unique aspect of the <cite>Lockerbie</cite> application---namely, that the Court and Security Council had been approached by opposing parties in the dispute---raised the possibility of inconsistent treatments of
the dispute by the Council and Court, a prospect to which the dissenting judges reacted differently. Judge Bedjaoui, for example, objected that the Court's role was not to exercise appellate jurisdiction over the Council, any more than the Council should impair the integrity of the Court's international judicial function.<sup><a href="#fifty9">59</a></sup> Judge Weeramantry, on the other hand, concluded that owing to the exercise of independent judgment, assessments by the Council and Court would not and need not always be in complete coincidence.<sup><a href="#sixty">60</a></sup>
<p>
Several others expressed substantive concerns with the manner in which the dispute was handled. Judge Ajibola regretted that the joint statements of 27 November 1991, and the two Security Council resolutions that relied on them, all appeared to violate the presumption of innocence of the two accused.<sup><a href="#sixty1">61</a></sup> Judge Shahabuddeen questioned whether an impartial trial was possible in the United States,<sup><a href="#sixty2">62</a></sup> and Judge <i>ad hoc</i> El-Kosheri wrote that the two accused &quot;could not possibly receive a fair trial, neither in the United States or in the United Kingdom, and not in Libya.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty3">63</a></sup> Judge Bedjaoui criticized the majority's retroactive use of resolution 748 (1992), contending that because the resolution did not yet have legal existence when proceedings before the Court concluded, it should have been beyond the case's purview.<sup><a href="#sixty4">64</a></sup>
<p>
The dissents also differed on the degree of scrutiny to which they would subject Security Council resolutions at the provisional stage. Judge Bedjaoui regarded such resolutions as enjoying a presumption of validity, of lawfulness, and of binding authority in preliminary matters.<sup><a href="#sixty5">65</a></sup> Without being seized of the wider matter, the Court could not censure the Security Council's discretionary characterization of the situation as one likely to threaten international peace and security. Yet Judge Bedjaoui immediately qualified this presumption by exempting a resolution that has &quot;as its object, or effect, not to withdraw a right from an Applicant State, but to prevent the exercise, by the Court itself, of the judicial function with which it has been invested by the Charter.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty6">66</a></sup> In such a situation, conflicting decisions by the Court
and the Security Council would apparently be acceptable since the conflict would arise from an exercise of independent judicial function in laying down international legality.
<p>
Similarly, Judge Weeramantry noted that among the matters entirely within the discretion of the Security Council are determinations under Article 39 of the existence of threats to the peace, breaches of peace, and acts of aggression. For this reason, he observed that the Security Council is the only judge of circumstances that would activate Chapter VII: &quot;[A]ny matter which is the subject of a valid Security Council decision under Chapter VII does not appear, <i>prima facie</i>, to be one with which the Court can properly deal.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty7">67</a></sup> He later concluded that the Court would not confront the Security Council where it had already exercised its powers &quot;<i>in a manner</i> which places obligations upon all United Nations Members&quot;; in areas not covered by the Security Council's &quot;<i>binding</i> decisions under Chapter VII,&quot; the Court would be free to use its influence and authority.<sup><a href="#sixty8">68</a></sup> Yet Judge Bedjaoui's and Judge Weeramantry's conclusions confound their premise. If Security Council resolutions are beyond censure at the provisional stage, how is the Court to discern the resolutions that by purpose or effect prevent
its exercise of the judicial function (and are thus invalid)? Assuming that the Security Council would not voice its malign purposes, how is the Court to divine them otherwise? If only the Security Council can assess the circumstances that engage Chapter VII, what would prompt it to declare its own actions invalid? If, instead, it is the Court that should distinguish &quot;valid&quot; decisions from &quot;invalid&quot; ones, how at the provisional stage could a Chapter VII decision ever be declared invalid, given Judge Weeramantry's <i>prima facie</i> presumption in favour of validity?
<p>
Judge <i>ad hoc</i> El-Kosheri took a different approach. He cited the <cite>South West Africa</cite><sup><a href="#sixty9">69</a></sup> decisions as well as Kelsen<sup><a href="#seventy">70</a></sup> to suggest that not all authorities regard United Nations members as obliged to carry out all decisions of the Security Council. He thought it possible that by adopting paragraph 1 of resolution 748 (1992), the Security Council may have impeded the Court's jurisdiction freely to exercise its inherent judicial function. In so doing, the Security Council exceeded its authority in a violation of Article 92 of the Charter.<sup><a href="#seventy1">71</a></sup> This &quot;<i>ultra vires</i> character&quot; of resolution 748 (1992) was vitiated in light of the warnings of several Security Council delegates<sup><a href="#seventy2">72</a></sup> regarding the risks of hasty adoption of its draft and a lack of respect for the Court's credibility and judicial function. Even on a <i>prima facie</i> basis, therefore, Judge <i>ad hoc</i> El-Kosheri regarded the resolution as having no legal effect on the Court's jurisdiction.
<p>
<h3>IV.   Rule of Law at the International Level</h3>

As Professor Reisman notes, the nominal constitutional matters in <cite>Lockerbie</cite> were straightforward enough: when the Security Council makes a valid decision under Chapter VII of the Charter concerning a state, that decision prevails over any other treaty-based right claimed by the state.<sup><a href="#seventy3">73</a></sup> Yet beneath this simple formula lay a fiendishly difficult problem: what (if anything) renders a decision under Chapter VII invalid, and who ultimately has authority to make this determination? These questions are particularly acute given the special character of Chapter VII decisions, which permit the Security Council to &quot;take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.&quot; The importance of the issues in <cite>Lockerbie</cite> makes the brevity of the Court's Order all the more unfortunate, since they were certainly of a type that reached &quot;so far beyond the immediate case as ... to merit some extended examination.&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy4">74</a></sup> Further, the case gave the Court an unequalled chance to pronounce upon these matters: the considerations at issue had never before arisen in so direct and immediate a way, or through as eminent and experienced international lawyers as those before the Court.<sup><a href="#seventy5">75</a></sup> Instead, the brief majority decision relegates to the separate and particularly to the dissenting opinions the pursuit of the most valuable aspects of the application. Doubtless the case's publicity, sensitivity, and provisional status understandably deterred a fuller judgment. Furthermore, some have lauded this judicial caution in the post-Cold War revival of the Security Council.<sup><a href="#seventy6">76</a></sup> Yet this caution need not have been displaced by a longer decision that treated the intricacies at stake with more candour and rigour.
<p>
I submit that such candour and explication could have revealed the focus of the case to be the supremacy of the rule of law at the international level.<sup><a href="#seventy7">77</a></sup> While only one judge employed this phrase explicitly, others used terminology having similar effect.<sup><a href="#seventy8">78</a></sup>
Regardless of the rubric under which these notions are considered, an inquiry into an international rule of law must first ask (as did Judge Weeramantry) whether a circumscribing boundary of norms limits the ambit within which United Nations organs must discharge their responsibilities.<sup><a href="#seventy9">79</a></sup> If such a boundary exists, the inquiry then must identify its content. It must also isolate the organ or organs competent to define those limits.
<p>
What I hope to demonstrate by pursuing these questions is that United Nations organs, and specifically the Security Council, operate within constraints to their competence. Some of the principles that inform these constraints lie in an international rule of law. A commitment to this rule of law necessitates a limited system of judicial review within the United Nations. This system, related to but distinct from domestic experience, would acknowledge the Security
Council's ability to assess its own competence at first instance. If an affected state objected to a binding recommendation resulting from that competence, the Court would have a broad power of <i>certiorari</i> to review the matter on grounds of institutional competence and compliance with general or customary international law.<sup><a href="#eighty">80</a></sup> As a result, the system would grant the Court unlimited jurisdiction in the sense that no disputes would be beyond its competence. This broad jurisdiction would, however, be strongly
curtailed by a high level of deference. The effect is to confirm the Court as the ultimate safeguard against patently unreasonable violations of institutional competence and principles of general or customary international law by United Nations organs. The balance of this article will examine these considerations in detail.<sup><a href="#eighty1">81</a></sup>
<p>
1. DOES A BOUNDARY OF NORMS CIRCUMSCRIBE THE LEGITIMATE ACTIVITY OF UNITED NATIONS ORGANS?
<p>
The constitutive statute of an international body is the primary source of its jurisdiction. The United Nations Charter, notwithstanding the debate on whether it is a constitutional document, is at the very least a treaty. The <cite>Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties</cite><sup><a href="#eighty2">82</a></sup> provides the general rules of treaty interpretation. By Article 31(1), we are to interpret a treaty in good faith, in accordance with
the ordinary meaning of the treaty's terms, and in light of the document's object and purpose. The United Nations arose from a basic aspiration for a secure peace based on justice, as expressed in the preamble to the Charter and in the basic principles and purposes set forth in Article 1. This starting point evinces that the framers intended to base the relations of states not solely on established rules of positive international law but also on the precepts of justice.<sup><a href="#eighty3">83</a></sup>
<p>
The Vienna Convention, by Article 32, also allows recourse to supplementary means of interpretation where an interpretation under Article 31 leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure. These supplementary means include reference to the preparatory works (<i>travaux pr&eacute;paratoires</i>) of the treaty. The <i>travaux</i> from the
San Francisco Conference confirm that United Nations organs operate within constraints of positive international law and justice.<sup><a href="#eighty4">84</a></sup> On 19 May 1945, during a meeting of Committee 2 of Commission III, dealing with the Charter's draft provisions relating to the Security Council, Belgium introduced a proposed amendment that proved prescient of the Libyan dispute. It observed that the power of the Security Council to recommend involved the possibility that a member state could be obliged to abandon a right granted to it by positive international law.
<blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment was, in case a party to a dispute considered that a recommendation of the Security Council infringed on its essential rights, to allow the state to request an advisory opinion on the question by the International Court of Justice. If the Court found such rights to be infringed or threatened, then the Security Council would be required either to reconsider the question or to refer the dispute to the General Assembly for a decision. It
was not in any sense the purpose of this amendment to limit the legitimate powers of the Security Council. It would, however, be desirable to strengthen the juridical basis of the decisions of the Security Council.<sup><a href="#eighty5">85</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The Soviet and American delegates opposed the amendment, in part because the Security Council was already bound to act in accordance with the principles of justice and international law. The French and Byelorussian delegates also opposed the amendment. Although the British and South African delegates opposed the proposal
as well, they did so on the basis that its acceptance would cause delay at a time when prompt Security Council action was essential. The Belgian delegate withdrew the amendment when assured that the term &quot;recommend&quot; in what would later become Chapter VI of the Charter did not entail any compulsion or enforcement for states.<sup><a href="#eighty6">86</a></sup> Had the amendment been adopted, it would clearly
have granted the Court a power of review. Yet, as Geoffrey Watson notes, the demise of this amendment did not reflect a rejection of judicial review of Security Council conduct. Instead, the Belgian desire for such review appeared to be unnecessary since recommendations under what is now Chapter VI were not to be binding.<sup><a href="#eighty7">87</a></sup>
<p>
More problematic for review of the Security Council by the Court is the fate of a second Belgian proposal made on 29 May 1945: that the Committee on Legal Problems, a branch of the Commission on Judicial Organization, determine the proper interpretive organ for the several parts of the Charter. In the ensuing debate, the General
Assembly, the Court, and a committee of experts were all nominated as possible interpretive organs. Nevertheless, the Committee rejected the second Belgian proposal &quot;as an established procedure.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty8">88</a></sup> A later subcommittee report wrote that the Belgian proposal was unnecessary since each organ would interpret the parts of the Charter applicable to its function.<sup><a href="#eighty9">89</a></sup> Furthermore, &quot;[u]nder unitary forms of national government the final determination of such a question may be vested in the highest court or in some other national authority. However, the nature of the Organization and its operation would not seem to be such as to invite the inclusion in the Charter of any provision of this nature.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety">90</a></sup> Note, though, that the report went on to conclude that if an organ's interpretation &quot;is not generally acceptable it will be without binding force.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety1">91</a></sup> A similar discussion occurred in Committee 1 of Commission
III, which was considering the articles relating to Structures and Procedures. A proposal by the Norwegian delegate to enhance restraints on the Security Council was also rejected given the existing constraints within the Charter's introductory chapters of compliance with international law and justice.<sup><a href="#ninety2">92</a></sup> Finally, initial drafts presented at Dumbarton Oaks of Article 1 (the provision that now qualifies the manner in which international peace and security are to be maintained) did not include the phrase &quot;in conformity with the principles of justice and international law.&quot; This phrase was added to later drafts at the initiative of the
Chinese delegation in response to fears concerning the enormous powers that might be wielded by the Security Council.<sup><a href="#ninety3">93</a></sup>
<p>
These <i>travaux</i> certainly do not recommend a strong doctrine of judicial review within the United Nations. Nevertheless, they do illuminate the intended scope of the powers exercised by United Nations organs and especially the need for the exercise of those powers to conform to notions of justice and international law. These limits suggest that the degree to which a particular exercise of law-making authority tracks the corresponding norms of the Charter will determine the extent to which that use of authority is valid or invalid, legal or illegal.<sup><a href="#ninety4">94</a></sup> It follows from the existence of this normative circumscribing boundary that United Nations organs can indeed act invalidly.<sup><a href="#ninety5">95</a></sup> The Charter does not confer an unlimited authority to do simply anything for which a political majority can be commanded at any given moment.<sup><a href="#ninety6">96</a></sup> That no body currently acts to review allegedly <i>ultra vires</i> conduct does not eliminate the possibility of either creating one or charging an existing one with this function.
<p>
This reference to a circumscribing boundary is familiar already from domestic experience. One of the earliest and most eloquent expositions of such a boundary remains that of the U.S. Supreme Court in its famous <cite>Marbury v. Madison</cite>.<sup><a href="#ninety7">97</a></sup> There the Court observed that the U.S. Constitution had been written specifically in order to define and limit the powers of the legislative branch. Allowing those limits
to be ignored by those intended to be restrained would therefore negate the Constitution's objective.<sup><a href="#ninety8">98</a></sup> To accord the legislature an unrestrained ambit would grant it a practical and real omnipotence, even as one professed to restrict its powers within narrow limits. The exercise would simultaneously
prescribe limits while declaring that those limits could be excepted at pleasure, relegating the writing of constitutions to being &quot;absurd attempts ... to limit a power, in its own nature illimitable.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety9">99</a></sup>
<p>
The intent, therefore, is to mirror at the international plane this domestic insistence that governments are subject to certain ground rules. This point may be less controversial than I believe it to be; Professor Franck remarks that the majority and dissenting opinions in the Libyan case seem to agree that there are limits to the manner in which the Security Council can discharge its functions.<sup><a href="#onehundred">100</a></sup> If so, then the Court appears unwilling to enforce these limits, at least at the provisional stage. Whether or not this agreement exists, my
contention here is only that the <i>travaux</i> and Charter text do recommend the identification and enforcement of boundaries to the institutional competence of United Nations organs.
<p>
2. CONTENT OF CIRCUMSCRIBING BOUNDARY OF NORMS
<p>
Once the supremacy of law is recognized as preserving fundamental norms and rights, the meaning of that law needs to be determined immediately: concerns will remain if the laws to be given supremacy are antagonistic to the norms and rights that are meant to be served by this elevation. Hence, it is meaningless to discuss the supremacy of law without simultaneously describing the content of that law.<sup><a href="#one01">101</a></sup> The previous section established that justice and international law condition the exercise of power by United Nations organs. These notions suggest that the content of the pertinent boundary for United Nations organs includes (a) compliance with institutional competence under the Charter, and (b) compliance with relevant and applicable principles of international law outside the Charter.<sup><a href="#one02">102</a></sup> Both concepts assert that the Security Council cannot make law by breaking law.
<p>
Before considering these two aspects of the constraint on United Nations organs, it should first be noted that the Court grants a presumption of lawfulness to their conduct.<sup><a href="#one03">103</a></sup> This presumption is crucial to the satisfactory operation of the United Nations, whose organs work within a system not of blinkered parallel function but of fruitful interaction.<sup><a href="#one04">104</a></sup> Accordingly, as the Court held in <cite>Certain Expenses</cite>, &quot;each organ must, in the first place at least, determine its own
jurisdiction.&quot;<sup><a href="#one05">105</a></sup> Note, however, that this wording does not foreclose the
possibility of a final determination of jurisdiction by another organ.<sup><a href="#one06">106</a></sup> Furthermore, since the Court only presumes validity, I submit that this presumption should not be irrebuttable even at the provisional stage.<sup><a href="#one07">107</a></sup> Unfortunately, the Court's Order in <cite>Lockerbie</cite> leaves this point unclear. While many of the judges hinted that the Court had an ability to review Security Council conduct, few would displace the presumption of validity since an interim application was not supposed to embrace the merits. An example of this reasoning may be found in the declaration of Judge Oda. Invoking the presumption, he noted that a decision of the Security Council properly taken in the exercise of its competence could not summarily be reopened (implying that a decision improperly taken could be reopened). Nevertheless, he concluded that the Court had no choice at the provisional stage but to acknowledge the pre-eminence of resolution 748 (1992).<sup><a href="#one08">108</a></sup> Even Judge Bedjaoui, critical of the Court's Order in most of his dissent, believed that pre-eminence should be given to resolution 748 (1992) even though provisional measures were <i>prima facie</i> merited.<sup><a href="#one09">109</a></sup>
<p>
The difficulty with this logic is that it will deny provisional measures in any dispute where the Security Council has acted under Chapter VII of the Charter. It is pointless to speak of Security Council conduct &quot;in the exercise of its competence&quot; if no basis exists on which to consider that competence. For sake of clarity, I fully embrace the presumption of validity and the proposition that United Nations organs determine their own competence at first instance. However, because these are only presumptions, parties ought to be extended an opportunity to rebut them at the provisional stage. In order to permit this, though, the Court will need to consider the merits of the case at least as they pertain to the presumptions, including details relating to the conditions precedent for an organ's exercise of competence. The objection to this proposal will be that it violates the principle that the disposition of an interim application cannot prejudge the disposition of the application on its full merits. However, this proposition is not universally accepted as true.<sup><a href="#one10">110</a></sup> Furthermore, only a subset of the full merits is relevant to competence. Thus, the non-anticipatory aspect of preliminary applications need not be compromised by a scrutiny of the merits that ground competence.
<p>
<i>Institutional Competence</i><br>
I turn to the first of the two constraints on United Nations organs: compliance with institutional competence. Being creations of the Charter enjoying delegated powers, such organs cannot derive authority but through the Charter.<sup><a href="#one11">111</a></sup> Their competence, therefore, is limited to the ambit of the authority accorded them by the Charter. Once the principles of the Charter are compromised beyond reasonable bounds of flexibility, and community interests are subordinated to particularistic interests of nation states, the conduct of a United Nations body becomes both invalid and inimical to the purposes of the organization.<sup><a href="#one12">112</a></sup> This distinction between valid and invalid Security Council action is particularly important for resolutions under Chapter VII, which are often regarded as enjoying unrestrained discretion premised on the existence of a threat to international peace and security. I urge instead that the determination of a threat to international peace and security ought not be accorded a talismanic status so as to exempt the Security Council from its erstwhile constraints. The potency of a determination under Chapter VII illuminates the need for close attention to the threshold question on which that resolution rests: the existence of a threat to peace. If such a threat exists, then whatever discretion the Charter accords to the Security Council is well-founded; if, however, the existence of such a threat is determined arbitrarily, then the Security Council's discretion will be used outside the Charter, rendering any resultant resolution invalid.
<p>
The formal mechanism through which this constraint may be enforced is a preliminary objection to the jurisdiction of the Security Council: objection <i>conditio sine qua non</i>. Municipal and international law both recognize legal acts as either pure or conditional. Where the act is conditional, its intrinsic validity is said to depend on the fulfilment of the condition precedent, or the <i>conditio sine qua non</i>. Where this threshold condition has not  been met, conduct whose validity relies on the presence of that condition is rendered invalid. Because it is of a peremptory character, the objection <i>conditio sine qua non</i> is one to which claims of political expedience have little meaning.<sup><a href="#one13">113</a></sup> The powerful consequence of a successful objection, therefore, is to render the invalid act a nullity.<sup><a href="#one14">114</a></sup> The doctrine has clear application in several Charter provisions.<sup><a href="#one15">115</a></sup> 
<p>
The objection, I suggest, also seems appropriate for Article 39 as well, such that the Security Council's determination of a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression is a <i>conditio sine qua non</i> to its competence to act under Chapter VII. While the determination of a threat to international peace and security does lie within the Security Council's competence, its importance is such that validity ought not to attach to determinations made unreasonably or implausibly.<sup><a href="#one16">116</a></sup> Surely the Security Council cannot arbitrarily proclaim anything it desires to be a &quot;threat to the peace.&quot; To hold otherwise would allow the Security Council to contravene the principles of justice and international law with impunity; it would also construct a new world order in which the Council is, in the words of Professor Dupuy, a &quot;world directorate.&quot;<sup><a href="#one17">117</a></sup> As Judge Gros remarked in <cite>South West Africa</cite>, almost any international matter can be construed as a threat to peace.<sup><a href="#one18">118</a></sup> Judge Fitzmaurice noted in the same case that limits on the powers of the Security Council &quot;are necessary because of the all too great ease with which any acutely controversial international situation can be represented as involving a latent threat to peace and security, even where it is really too remote genuinely to constitute one. Without these limitations, the functions of the Security Council could be used for purposes never intended.&quot;<sup><a href="#one19">119</a></sup>
<p>
This is not to advocate the substitution of one organ's opinion for that of the Security Council; <cite>South West Africa</cite> rejected the notion that the Court exercises full power of judicial review or  appeal.<sup><a href="#one20">120</a></sup> Nevertheless, municipal law concepts of separation of
powers do apply to international institutions, which feature a more organic integration, even if they are not directly applicable.<sup><a href="#one21">121</a></sup> Borrowing from municipal experience, I would propose a patent unreasonableness standard in the test of validity within the context of the interplay of law and politics.<sup><a href="#one22">122</a></sup> This would require the Court to ask itself whether the exercise of authority by the Security Council was so patently unreasonable as to constitute a loss of jurisdiction. This threshold would entail a high degree of deference to the actions of the Security Council, and would reflect the latter's primary (though not exclusive)<sup><a href="#one23">123</a></sup>
responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.<sup><a href="#one24">124</a></sup> It would also strike a balance that municipal law systems likely would not tolerate, granting broad <i>certiorari</i> but imposing a stringent test of invalidity. So long as a determination under Article 39 could not fairly be described as patently unreasonable, the Security Council would enjoy full authority, its discretion limited only by the ongoing need to comply with international law.
<p>
This resort to domestic law will be troubling for dualists, who regard international law and municipal law as parts of several legal orders existing independently from each other. Certainly it would be wrong to homogenize the two within a monistic whole. Domestic systems typically feature a strict separation of powers and a hierachical arrangement in which the judicial arm reviews the actions of the executive arm. This foundational nature of judicial review in municipal law is not paralleled at the international level, whose peculiar feature is its diffuse, horizontal distribution of often coextensive authority.<sup><a href="#one25">125</a></sup> The Court is thus not vested with the broad review or appellate jurisdiction often given to the highest courts in municipal frameworks.<sup><a href="#one26">126</a></sup> For this
reason, the dualists are right to oppose the casual transfer of domestic principles to the international plane.
<p>
This objection is not, however, sufficiently strong to discredit all reference to domestic law. While a conclusive formula remains elusive for the precise connection between international and municipal law, whatever the relationship---be it one of &quot;interaction,&quot; &quot;interdependence,&quot; &quot;complementariness,&quot; or &quot;dialectic links&quot;---it cannot convincingly be denied that the international r&eacute;gime owes a debt to its domestic counterpart.<sup><a href="#one27">127</a></sup> As Professor Brierly notes,
<blockquote>
[P]rivate law, being in general more developed than international law, has always constituted a sort of reserve store of principles upon which the latter has been in the habit of drawing. Roman law ... was so drawn upon by the early writers on international law, and the process continues, for the good reason that a principle which is found to be generally accepted by civilized legal systems may fairly be assumed to be so reasonable as to be necessary under any system.<sup><a href="#one28">128</a></sup>
</blockquote>
For example, the law of treaties is largely derived from general principles of contract common to various municipal legal systems.<sup><a href="#one29">129</a></sup> The same may be said for such principles as prescription, right of passage, estoppel, unjust enrichment, measure of damages, and <i>res judicata</i>, as well as international law on territorial sovereignty, boundary questions, water rights, aerial jurisdiction,
state responsibility, and occupation.<sup><a href="#one30">130</a></sup> This debt of international law to municipal law has already been recognized by the Court,<sup><a href="#one31">131</a></sup> which by Article 38(1) of its own Statute is directed to apply &quot;the general principles of law recognized by
civilized nations&quot; as one of the sources of international law. 
<p>
Until modern times, government had been considered an exclusively national function. In the mid-1800s, though, states began recognizing that without coordinating their action with that of other states they would be unable to serve fully the interests of their own people. If this recognition did not lead to the constitutionalizing of international society, it was at least a step toward that end.<sup><a href="#one32">132</a></sup> As a result, it is proper to consider the degree to which modern international bodies ought to perform for inter-state relations the functions that domestic institutions serve in national systems. Indeed, as Judge Weeramantry noted, the means by which the Charter fulfils in common the purposes and principles of the United Nations system resemble the constitutional framework of many domestic jurisdictions.<sup><a href="#one33">133</a></sup> Since issues similar to those raised
in <cite>Lockerbie</cite> have already been considered domestically, it is at least worthwhile to ask whether principles from the national context have an international role. In having recourse to domestic experience, the procedure is not to borrow a ready-made set of particular rules lock, stock, and barrel. Instead, the process is a threefold one of identification, abstraction, and generalization. First, identify the essential problems with which municipal and international law have both had to grapple. Next, consider the abstract principles with which municipal law has responded to these problems. Finally, strip these principles of their national particularities and synthesize them into their most general and truly universal aspects.<sup><a href="#one34">134</a></sup> This process yields an indication of policy or principle, one whose defining
characteristic is its legal (rather than international or municipal) nature. The conclusion is that there is a common core of principles that guide both municipal and international law.
<p>
In the following section, I will suggest several such principles and group them under the rubric &quot;rule of law.&quot; For the moment, though, my aim is to establish the first constraint on the conduct of United Nations organs, namely institutional competence assessed on a standard of patent unreasonableness. On this criterion of validity, resolution 748 (1992) is at least on an uncertain footing. Can it safely be said that the Security Council's determination of a threat to international peace and security was not patently unreasonable? It will be recalled that the threat was said to lie in the Libyan Government's failure to demonstrate its renunciation of terrorism and in particular its continued failure to respond fully and effectively to the requests in resolution 731 (1992). While our notions of threats to peace are broader today than in 1945, it is dubious whether they extend so far as to permit this type of conduct to support a Chapter VII decision. This is doubly so in view of the several constructive measures and proposals taken by Libya, each of which had been rebuffed by the British and American authorities. The original Lockerbie bombing was not characterized as a threat tointernational peace and security, and it is not clear that the mere
refusal of Libya to surrender the suspects---which was entirely legitimate at least until resolution 748 (1992)<sup><a href="#one35">135</a></sup> ---could constitute such a threat. Last, resolution 748 (1992) passed by only one vote more than the minimum of nine needed for approval---a smaller show of support than any of the resolutions dealing with Iraq during the Persian Gulf crisis. While none of these objections is fatal to a declaration of the existence of a threat to international peace and security, collectively they suggest that the Court's alacrity in upholding resolution 748 (1992) may have been premature without closer scrutiny of the alleged threat.
<p>
<i>General or Customary International Law</i><br>
What I urge to be a second aspect of the circumscribing boundary is more contentious: where the Security Council acts within its strict institutional competence but in a manner that contravenes general or customary international law. Judge Fitzmaurice noted in <cite>South West Africa</cite> that because the United Nations is itself a subject of international law, the Council is as much subject to the principles of international law as any individual member state.<sup><a href="#one36">136</a></sup> Additionally, although the competence of the Security Council derives primarily from Article 24, it is also restricted by that same Article's requirement that theSecurity Council act &quot;in accordance with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations.&quot;<sup><a href="#one37">137</a></sup> These contexts evoke
notions of a rule of law, one whose content is not immediately obvious. As already suggested, however, we can look for inspiration to domestic frameworks of the rule of law, whose circumscribing boundaries the international order emulated in the first instance. Several universal principles characterize the core of most municipal visions of the rule of law. These principles include the belief that governmental actors must rely on authority that is conferred by law;<sup><a href="#one38">138</a></sup> that law must conform to standards of procedural and substantive justice; that a separation is critical between the judicial and legislative branches;<sup><a href="#one39">139</a></sup> and that the judiciary must be independent <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the executive.
<p>
As discussed, the natural objection is that these principles are drawn from municipal or national law, which is not law in the same sense as international law. Yet our municipal legal orders are the prototype of all law,<sup><a href="#one40">140</a></sup> and nothing in these domestic principles need restrict them to the domestic context. The basic unit of law, whether national or international, is the legal rule or norm. The order of law being coercive, a sanction ought to take place when a norm is violated.<sup><a href="#one41">141</a></sup> The domestic rule of law helps to legitimate the imposition of this sanction; it strengthens the status of the order as a <i>legal</i> order. Similarly, at the world level we seek to affirm that the international community is also a legal community. The principles that strengthen the legality of the
municipal order have the same effect at the international level. The attraction of an international rule of law is thus its nurturing effect on the validity of international law, on our ability to say that an international actor ought to behave as international legal norms prescribe.
<p>
Support for this two-pronged constraint---compliance with institutional competence and with general or customary international law---may be found in <cite>South West Africa</cite>.<sup><a href="#one42">142</a></sup> Following World War I, South Africa was granted a Mandate for the former German colony of South West Africa (renamed Namibia in 1968). By resolution 2145 (XXI) (1966), the General Assembly decided that the Mandate was terminated and that South Africa had no other right to administer the Territory. When South Africa refused to withdraw its administration, the Security Council took various actions, including resolution 276 (1970), which declared the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia illegal. The Security Council intensified pressure on South Africa by requesting an
advisory opinion from the Court on the question, &quot;What are the legal consequences for States of the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia, notwithstanding Security Council resolution 276  (1970)?&quot; The governments of France and South Africa contended before the Court that both the General Assembly and Security Council had acted <i>ultra vires</i> in passing these resolutions. In its advisory opinion, the Court concluded &quot;that the decisions made by the Security Council ... were adopted in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter and in accordance with its Articles 24 and 25. The decisions are consequently binding on all States Members of the United Nations, which are thus under obligation to accept and carry them out.&quot;<sup><a href="#one43">143</a></sup> The
implication of this wording is that the decisions may not have been binding had the Court detected any violation of the Charter or a departure from the principles that inform it.
<p>
The separate and dissenting opinions in <cite>South West Africa</cite>, however, give a fuller discussion of the limits to the conduct of United Nations organs. Judge Petr&eacute;n noted that &quot;[s]o long as the validity of the resolutions upon which resolution 276 (1970) is based has not been established, it is clearly impossible for the Court to pronounce on the legal consequences of resolution 276 (1970), for there can be no such legal consequences if the basic resolutions are illegal ...&quot;<sup><a href="#one44">144</a></sup> This <i>de facto</i> presumption of invalidity was echoed by Judge Onyeama: &quot;[W]hen ... decisions bear upon a case properly before the Court, and a correct judgment or opinion could not be rendered without determining the validity of such decisions, the Court could not possibly avoid such a determination without abdicating its role of a judicial organ ... . I do not conceive it
as compatible with the judicial function that the Court will proceed to state the consequences of acts whose validity is assumed, without itself testing the lawfulness of the origin of those acts.&quot;<sup><a href="#one45">145</a></sup> A third separate opinion of note in <cite>South West Africa</cite> is that of
Judge de Castro, who regarded the (in)validity of resolutions of the General Assembly and Security Council as an interplay of two principles:
<ol>
<li>The principle of division of powers---the Charter set up three organs, each having sovereign powers in the sphere of its competence ...
<li>The principle of `legal-ness'---the Court, as a legal organ, cannot co-operate with a resolution which is clearly void, contrary to the rules of the Charter, or contrary to the principles of law.<sup><a href="#one46">146</a></sup>
</ol>
Judge de Castro's first principle is identical to that of institutional competence advocated earlier in this article. His second principle is less satisfying, leaving unclear, for example, how a resolution that complies with the Charter and the principles of law could nevertheless be clearly void. In any event, these three
separate opinions propose that validity be a threshold criterion and that such validity be gauged on principles of institutional competence and legality.
<p>
Two dissenting opinions in <cite>South West Africa</cite> attest to the Court's willingness to scrutinize closely the Security Council's claims of institutional competence. Judge Gros, among others, expressed dissatisfaction with the manner in which the Security Council exercised its discretionary power under the head of the maintenance of international peace and security. He regarded this exercise as &quot;another attempt to modify the principles of the Charter as regards the powers vested by States in the organs they instituted. To assert that a matter may have a distant repercussion on the maintenance of peace is not enough to turn the Security Council into a world government.&quot;<sup><a href="#one47">147</a></sup> Judge Gros therefore displayed no reticence at testing this assertion by the Security Council, lamenting that &quot;[i]t used not to be the Court's habit to take for granted the premises of a  legal situation the consequences of which it has been asked to state ... How indeed can a court deduce any obligation from a given situation without first having tested the lawfulness of the origins of that situation?&quot;<sup><a href="#one48">148</a></sup> Judge Fitzmaurice continued this theme in his
dissent: &quot;[Article 24] does not limit the <i>occasions</i> on which the Security Council can act in the preservation of peace and security, provided the threat said to be involved is not a mere figment or pretext.&quot;<sup><a href="#one49">149</a></sup>
<p>
<cite>South West Africa</cite>---in its majority, separate, and dissenting opinions---therefore stands as a model not only for the Court's acceptance of this two-pronged constraint on United Nations bodies but also of its awareness of its own interdependence and interrelation with the other primary United Nations  organs.<sup><a href="#one50">150</a></sup> Admittedly the case was only an advisory opinion with minimal binding effect, if any; it was also a decision at the merits stage rather than at the provisional stage.
Nevertheless, the various decisions unanimously scrutinize the validity of Security Council conduct, and they demonstrate a refusal to abdicate the judicial function by holding all contentious Security Council resolutions to standards of competence and legality.
<p>
The formal mechanism through which this second constraint may be pursued is the objection <i>ultra vires</i> which, like the objection <i>conditio sine qua non</i>, is of a peremptory character. The theory of excess of powers also originates in municipal administrative law and has been applied to international bodies as a general principle of law. Since then, no objection has been raised so frequently as that of <i>ultra vires</i>, even though no general Charter provision expressly authorizes this means of defence.
Although the objection has been weakened by the increasing tendency of United Nations organs not to cite the sources of their authority, it survives at least in respect of conduct---such as Security Council resolutions 731 (1992) and 748 (1992)---where the source of competence is explicit. Accordingly, an exercise of the Security Council's powers in contravention of general or customary international law is invalid on grounds of <i>ultra vires</i>, and if  made under Chapter VII ought to be of no binding authority. Although
in a positive sense it may continue to be regarded as binding for purposes of the Charter, this cannot resurrect its legality in the eyes of the general r&eacute;gime of international law.<sup><a href="#one51">151</a></sup>
<p>
On the second criterion of validity, both resolution 731 (1992) and resolution 748 (1992) almost certainly contravened the relevant and applicable principles of international law due to &quot;intrinsic defects.&quot;<sup><a href="#one52">152</a></sup> For example, resolution 731 (1992) incorporated (<i>inter alia</i>) the joint United States and United Kingdom statements of 27 November 1991. By requiring the payment of compensation by Libya immediately, these statements assumed the guilt of the two accused and therefore jeopardized the presumption of innocence. The resolution also demanded that the two accused be tried in either the United States or the United Kingdom, when it is doubtful whether a fair trial could be secured in either country. Third, since both the United States and the United Kingdom voted in favour of the resolution, it also was inconsistent with Article 27(3)'s requirement that any party to a dispute abstain from voting on any decision under Chapter VI regarding that dispute. China's abstention may also contravene the same Article's requirement that decisions by the Security Council be made &quot;by an affirmative vote of nine members including the concurring votes of the permanent members.&quot; Finally, the resolution seems to have ignored the Montreal Convention, which provided the international law in precisely the matters at issue; by so doing, the Security Council prevented a member state from invoking its
legitimate rights under a properly implemented international convention.<sup><a href="#one53">153</a></sup>
<p>
It may be observed that Security Council resolutions authorizing use of force regularly jeopardize principles of international law (such as, for example, due process). Yet such resolutions can be distinguished from those at issue here. Not every resolution that limits a right collateral to those truly in issue should be deemed <i>ultra vires</i>. As Judge Morelli noted in <cite>Certain Expenses</cite>, &quot;... to a large extent the non-conformity of [an] act with a legal rule [is] a mere irregularity having no effect on the
validity of the act. It is only in especially serious cases that an act of the Organization could be regarded as invalid, and hence an absolute nullity.&quot;<sup><a href="#one54">154</a></sup> Resolution 731 (1992), however, went to the core of the dispute, repudiating the very principles that Libya sought to invoke. For this reason, resolution 731 (1992) should likely have been held to be <i>ultra vires</i> and invalid on the
basis of its having violated the relevant and applicable principles of international law. If this is correct, then it follows that resolution 748 (1992), which repeats these same four violations by incorporating resolution 731 (1992), would similarly be <i>ultra vires</i> and invalid.
<p>
3. COMPETENCE OF UNITED NATIONS ORGANS TO ENFORCE BOUNDARY OF NORMS
<p>
If the boundary that I have described in fact exists, and if its effect is to hold all United Nations organs to standards of institutional authority and legal validity, then which of the organization's bodies is competent and best able to enforce this boundary? The entire question of the effect of illegal acts is closely related to the identification of suitable mechanisms that determine whether an act is in fact illegal.<sup><a href="#one55">155</a></sup> Indeed, the essence of international law has been described as a regulation of competencies, extending beyond mere assignments of jurisdiction to include confining international organs to the areas in which they are truly able to cope effectively.<sup><a href="#one56">156</a></sup> Presumably the organ best able to enforce limitations will be that with the highest ability to ensure compliance. Only two organs of the United Nations have the delivery of binding decisions identified explicitly as being among their powers under the Charter---the Security Council and the Court---and it is upon these organs that this discussion will focus. In brief, one facet of the rule of law that was postulated earlier was that governmental actors enjoy only that jurisdiction conferred by law. The autointerpretation of Security Council jurisdiction by the Security Council itself is of little persuasive value,<sup><a  href="#one57">157</a></sup> which leaves the Court as the organ best suited to ensure that Security Council resolutions comport with their normative limitations.
<p>
This is a highly controversial and oversimplified conclusion, and I expect that objections to it will follow one of two avenues: either that it disregards the text of the Charter, or that it corrodes the distinction between law and politics. Let me pursue these critiques with a view to assessing judicial propriety and the determination of what primacy (if any) is to be given to the Security Council <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the Court.<sup><a href="#one58">158</a></sup> My goal is to strike a middle ground between two austere and I think equally undesirable extremes. One pole regards the Security Council as infallible not because it is wise but simply because it is final.<sup><a href="#one59">159</a></sup> This perspective, however, threatens to leave the relationship between the Security Council and Court indefinite at best and nonexistent at worst. The result is a Security Council, ostensibly bound by the Charter and international law, with an unrestrained ambit of discretion. The other extreme is to give the Court full reign to intervene into Security Council matters indiscriminately. What results is a violation of the Security Council's primary responsibility for maintenance of peace and security, and a paralysis of that organ's powers in times of true crisis and emergency. How best can these two extremes be reconciled?
<p>
(i) <i>The Charter of the United Nations</i><br>
One approach to determining the Court's competence to assess the validity of Security Council resolutions is a straight  textual analysis of the Charter. The concept that the Court has formed of its role within the United Nations system, and the attitudes of members toward the role of the Court, have a common basis in the Charter and the links it established between the Court and United Nations, and between the former's Statute and the latter's Charter.<sup><a href="#one60">160</a></sup> Unfortunately, the Charter does not expressly indicate the legal nature of most United Nations organs. Nevertheless, those who would deny the Court's competence to review Security Council conduct first note the grant of primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security to the Security Council in Article 24(1). Although Article 92 appoints the Court to be the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, this provision does not accord
the Court a pre-eminent position in matters of dispute settlement or of Charter interpretation. As indicated earlier, proposals to this effect were made but rejected in favour of placing the Court on an equal footing with other organs in these matters.<sup><a href="#one61">161</a></sup> Therefore, as noted in <cite>Nicaragua</cite>, the Security Council and Court perform &quot;separate but complementary
functions.&quot;<sup><a href="#one62">162</a></sup>
<p>
Charter text also indicates that the organic relationship between the Court and the United Nations is much closer than that which existed between the Permanent Court of International Justice and the League of Nations.<sup><a href="#one63">163</a></sup> The Permanent Court, though intimately related to the League, was not one of its organs and operated as an exclusively judicial body. By contrast, the International Court of Justice is an organ of the United Nations, and the Statute of the Court forms an integral part of the Charter.<sup><a href="#one64">164</a></sup> Notably, nothing in the Charter's wording prohibits the Security Council from bypassing the Court altogether, even in the case of what is called a legal dispute. Article 37(2) contains no mandatory provisions; under it, the Security Council need only take into <i>consideration</i> that legal disputes <i>as a general rule</i> should be referred to the Court.<sup><a href="#one65">165</a></sup> In addition, by Article 25, member states agreed to accept and carry out decisions on matters of international peace and security when made by the Security Council in accordance with the Charter; hence, the Security Council uniquely enjoys a blend of executive, legislative, and at least quasi-judicial powers.
<p>
In short, the Charter's drafting and text are indeed fatal to claims that the Court enjoys a robust power to review the validity of Security Council resolutions---or at least to those claims that hope to be interpretive of the Charter. This objection is not, however, determinative of the issue. First, it leaves open the possibility
that the Court possesses some limited power of review. Although the Charter clearly makes the Court only one organ of several within the United Nations, the Court nevertheless &quot;occupies a special position
in relation to the other five principal organs, into whose hierarchical structure it is not integrated.&quot;<sup><a href="#one66">166</a></sup> While the Court decides cases in its own name, decisions by the Security Council are made on behalf of the organization as a whole.<sup><a href="#one67">167</a></sup> A second reason for not regarding Charter text as determinative is that multiple commentators regard the Charter as poorly drafted.<sup><a href="#one68">168</a></sup> Last, however the links that existed between the Security Council and the Court stood in 1945, they are capable of evolution. An analysis of the wording of the Charter will recall that the document as originally written and
adopted was viewed as only the framework of a potential system.<sup><a href="#one69">169</a></sup> 
<p>
(ii) <i>Law and Politics</i><br>
An alternate basis on which to assess the Court's ability to review Security Council resolutions rests on the supposed dichotomy between legal and political matters. Reference to this distinction has been drawn not only to support such review but also to deny it. For example, some have maintained that the Court's competence to review the validity of Security Council conduct stems from the nature of these organs. Judge Fitzmaurice has written that &quot;a political organ ... is not itself competent to make the necessary legal determinations on which the justification for [each] action must rest. This can only be done by a legal organ competent to make such determinations.&quot;<sup><a href="#one70">170</a></sup> Any decision otherwise, he warned, may have to be considered <i>ultra vires</i> and hence invalid. His contention was
that the influence of legal rules in the United Nations is contingent upon their degree of impartial authority; hence, it is argued, for maximal influence the organization should rely on the ascertainment of legal rules by a non-political body not subject to the control of any particular government.<sup><a href="#one71">171</a></sup> 
<p>
The Security Council is comprised of the representatives of 15 member states of the United Nations, with 5 permanent members---China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States---and 10 additional members normally elected by the General Assembly for two-year periods. A General Assembly resolution requires that these 10 places be distributed as follows: one for East Europe, two for Latin America, two for West Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, and five for Asian and African states. In its primary
responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, the Security Council's main functions are the peaceful settlement of disputes, action with respect to threats to peace, and provisional measures for peacekeeping. The Court, by contrast, is composed of 15 judges elected by the General Assembly and Security Council irrespective of nationality (although no more than one national of any state may be a member of the Court).<sup><a href="#one72">172</a></sup> In practice, four judges have tended to come from West Europe, one from the United States, two from South America, two from East Europe, and six from Africa and Asia. By Article 2 of the Court's Statute, the judges must be candidates &quot;of high moral character, who possess the qualifications ... for appointment to the highest judicial offices, or are jurisconsults of recognized competence in international law.&quot; Apart from the Secretariat, the Court is the only principal organ not composed of representatives of governments. The judges' independence is further secured by the granting of diplomatic privileges and immunities to them during their term of office. Advocates of the political/judicial distinction cite this independence as revealing the non-political nature of the Court. The Security Council, by contrast, is said to be  a political rather than a judicial organ because its members are not independent. Hence, it is claimed, the impartiality of the Court recommends that organ's competence to review the validity of Security Council resolutions.
<p>
While I am sympathetic to the conclusion, I submit that this rationale does not withstand scrutiny. It must indeed be true that the authority of an organ's determinations increases with its impartiality, but this is an inadequate justification for granting the Court power to assess validity. The overt lobbying of the Security Council, though unsavoury, is nevertheless part of the  process. As Professor Schachter notes, members of the United Nations &quot;will, of course, exhibit partisanship and interest in varying degree. Governments are expected to take positions in the political organs in accordance with their conceptions of national   interest and it is apparent that these conceptions will embrace considerations based on ties of alliance, friendship or political bargaining.&quot;<sup><a href="#one73">173</a></sup> Although the Security Council is political in the common sense, it is also a political organization based upon the rule of law and operating under a legal institution. The mere fact that its decisions may result from the competition of national interests does not inevitably render it unfit to assess validity. Furthermore, the Security Council is an organ with mixed personalities, since (as noted) it has at times acted as a quasi-judicial body.<sup><a href="#one74">174</a></sup>
<p>
Reciprocally, the proposition that the Court is an entirely non-political body is dubious. More accurately, the Court is a hybrid of arbitral tribunal, legal adviser, and court of law; of trial and appellate court; of &quot;principal judicial organ&quot; of the United Nations and autonomous adjudicative body; of civil law and common law formalities and techniques; of diplomacy and law.<sup><a href="#one75">175</a></sup> It is true that Article 20 of the Court's Statute directs that each judge must solemnly declare that his or her powers will be exercised impartially and conscientiously. Nevertheless, the record indicates that individual judges, more often than not, are influenced by the views of their own governments. Indeed this is taken for granted when a judge is a national of a state party to the case; the provision for <i>ad hoc</i> judges is, at least in part, recognition of this partisanship. Many judges are former government officials, and one cannot help but conclude that &quot;[t]here is inevitably an irreducible political element in the Court.&quot;<sup><a href="#one76">176</a></sup> This is not to claim that decisions of the Security Council and the Court are indistinguishable; the latter body must at least justify its decisions through reference to authoritative legal norms. Nevertheless, both organs evince a blend of political and at least quasi-judicial function; their differences are in degree rather than kind. For this reason, legal and political
disputes cannot persuasively be distinguished by the nature of either the Security Council or the Court.
<p>
A different invocation of the supposed dichotomy between legal and political matters, one which aspires to deny the Court a power of review, relates to the nature not of the organs themselves but of the questions that they are able to entertain. On this rationale, the Security Council is deemed competent to decide political matters, whereas the Court is accorded primacy in legal matters. This distinction deserves exploration, not only because it derives in part from the Charter's text but also because of its rich pedigree.<sup><a href="#one77">177</a></sup> The notion of inherent limitations on the scope of the international judicial
process is comparatively recent. Edward Gordon has traced this notion to a distinction first drawn in the mid-1700s by Swiss jurist Emmerich de Vattel. While Vattel embraced arbitration as a reasonable means of dispute resolution, he saw it as appropriate for only those conflicts that did not directly affect the state.<sup><a href="#one78">178</a></sup> It therefore became necessary to distinguish essential rights
and less important ones in order to determine where arbitration would be useful. In practice, however, essential rights were construed as only those that threatened a state's very survival. Since these were few, Vattel's distinction became meaningless. Later international legal scholars sought to revive Vattel's insight by enhancing the class of essential rights, substituting broader notions of sovereign prerogative for those of national survival. Through this development we inherited the distinction now known as political disputes versus legal disputes.<sup><a href="#one79">179</a></sup> In his 1873 speech at the first meeting of the Institute of International Law, Professor Levin Goldschmidt defined legal disputes between nations as those &quot;which ought to be decided by the application of principles of law.&quot;<sup><a href="#one80">180</a></sup> Since 1899, this distinction has informed most general conventions for the peaceful settlement of disputes<sup><a href="#one81">181</a></sup> including its appearance in Article 13 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. The substance of this Article was in turn incorporated into Article 36(2) of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice which, with slight modification a
quarter-century later, became an article of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.<sup><a href="#one82">182</a></sup>
<p>
Despite the distinction's longevity, neither the Charter nor the Statute explicitly define the term &quot;legal disputes,&quot; nor are any criteria offered in either instrument by which such &quot;legal disputes&quot; may be distinguished from others.<sup><a href="#one83">183</a></sup> Article 36(2) simply lists the categories of &quot;legal disputes&quot; in respect of which the obligation of compulsory adjudication exists.<sup><a href="#one84">184</a></sup> However, defenders of the distinction usually construe
&quot;law&quot; as consisting of the body of legal norms and relationships existing between and among states, which grew largely out of custom and treaty. &quot;Legal&quot; issues are therefore those governed by law in this sense, and &quot;political&quot; issues are those that are not. These notions in turn represent carryovers from certain domestic contexts, where &quot;legal&quot; issues are those suitable for adjudication, and &quot;political&quot; ones are not justiciable.
<p>
My difficulties with the distinction between legal and political issues are twofold. First, I am pessimistic as to the ability todistinguish convincingly legal and political matters.<sup><a href="#one85">185</a></sup> The parties at issue will always be independent states rendering public claims, implicating the policy choices of their respective sovereign governments. Hence, virtually every case the Court hears is of a &quot;political&quot; nature, whether or not it entails &quot;legal&quot; issues as well.<sup><a href="#one86">186</a></sup> As Professor Lauterpacht wrote in 1933
<blockquote>
[A]ll international disputes are, irrespective of their gravity, disputes of a legal character in the sense that, so long as the rule of law is recognized, they are capable of an answer by the application of legal rules ... . All conflicts in the sphere of international politics can be reduced to contests of a legal nature ... . [T]he only decisive test of the justiciability of the dispute is the willingness of the disputants to submit the conflict to the arbitrament of law.<sup><a href="#one87">187</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Furthermore, even if the distinction were clear, it would fail to identify the organ whose classification of the dispute is to be authoritative.
<p>
A second, and more fundamental, objection to the distinction between political and legal disputes pertains to its corrosive influence on the rule of law. The success of a constitutional approach to international law relies on its completeness and its ability to address all important issues that confront it; if certain matters lie beyond the reach of the constitution, they are by definition no longer constrained by that document. The system will therefore be incomplete with respect to those gaps.<sup><a href="#one88">188</a></sup> In domestic law, many issues deemed to be &quot;political&quot; still fall within the general constitutional
framework in that they must still be resolved peaceably and in accordance with law. However, at the international level there is no such framework and &quot;political&quot; issues become unregulated except by political forces. The traditional conclusion---that these &quot;political&quot; issues cannot, and must not, be subjected to any international rules---risks a r&eacute;gime of disorder.
<p>
Furthermore, the use of the qualifier &quot;political&quot; is easily expandable to include any situation to which the parties involved do not wish to see law or principle applied. Most serious issues are rarely regarded as anything other than political. Additionally, a majority of disputes feature at least one party seeking to justify its position by reference to what it claims to be its legal rights; that the dispute may involve high political issues does not make it any less legal. This classification is juridically unproblematic
until it serves to place those disputes beyond the sort of limitations that I am advocating.<sup><a href="#one89">189</a></sup> My submission therefore is that a commitment to the rule of law dictates
that no Security Council disputes, however framed, be regarded as inherently beyond either the need for validity<sup><a href="#one90">190</a></sup> or the purview of the Court to validate. This in turn
necessitates an identity between traditionally &quot;political&quot; issues and traditionally &quot;legal&quot; issues, and requires bringing both into an international constitutional framework.<sup><a href="#one91">191</a></sup>
<p>
Some would object that the distinction between political and legal matters does not claim to classify all disputes neatly and completely as legal or political. One defender sought to permit some overlap between the two by allowing a dispute's characterization to be determined by &quot;the objective aimed at or the position adopted by  each party in the dispute.&quot;<sup><a href="#one92">192</a></sup> This response is unsatisfactory on several grounds: it would allow parties to contract out of the requirements of
international law by mutually agreeing to frame the dispute as political; it is unhelpful where the parties adopt polar positions with respect to legal rights; and it fails to note that a dispute may be both political and legal in different respects.
<p>
If, as I suggest, a dispute should be regarded as both legal and political, then it follows that the same dispute may be submitted to both the Security Council and the Court, each of which impose a hybrid of legal and political procedure. While concurrent jurisdiction often raises the spectre of &quot;forum  shopping,&quot; this concern is absent if the final forum <i>is</i> the Court (that is, regardless of whether a party &quot;shops&quot; at first instance at the Court or the Security Council). The Court has repeatedly expressed its belief that the simultaneous treatment of one matter by multiple United Nations organs is unproblematic. In 1979, militant elements in Iran occupied and seized the United States Embassy in Tehran and elsewhere, detaining diplomatic staff and two private citizens as hostages. Besides appealing to the Security Council, the United States instituted proceedings before the Court in November, 1979. By the time that a decision on the merits was released on 24 May 1980, the Security Council had already passed resolutions and the Secretary-General had even struck a fact-finding commission. The Court nevertheless exercised its judicial function, and observed that
<blockquote>
it does not seem to have occurred to any member of the [United Nations Security] Council that there was or could be anything irregular in the simultaneous exercise of their respective functions by the Court and the Security Council. Nor is there in this any cause for surprise ... It is for the Court, the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, to resolve any legal questions that may be in issue between parties to a dispute; and the resolution of such legal questions by the Court may be an important, and sometimes decisive, factor in promoting the peaceful settlement of the dispute. This is indeed recognized by Article 36 of the Charter ...<sup><a href="#one93">193</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Hence, <cite>Tehran Hostages</cite> &quot;suggests a division of functional responsibilities between the Court and other United Nations organs, one that does not preclude, or indeed may even dictate, the simultaneous application of political and legal methods to the resolution of inter-state disputes.&quot;<sup><a href="#one94">194</a></sup>
<p>
A similar conclusion was reached in <cite>Nicaragua</cite>. On 9 April 1984, Nicaragua instituted proceedings before the Court against the United States, alleging that American involvement with military and paramilitary actions against Nicaragua had violated international obligations. Although the dispute had already come before the Security Council, the Court held on 26 November 1984 that it had jurisdiction to entertain the case and that Nicaragua's claim was admissible. The Court thus denied that the mere presence of an issue before one United Nations organ should preclude another organ from simultaneously considering that issue.<sup><a href="#one95">195</a></sup> This perspective has been echoed by academic commentators: &quot;[T]here is ... no express authority in the Charter or in the Statute for the proposition that, if a case submitted to the Court should constitute a threat to world peace, the Security Council may seise itself of the case and thereby put an end to the Court's jurisdiction.&quot;<sup><a href="#one96">196</a></sup>
<p>
It is therefore submitted that although this identity of question results in the possibility of conflict, such conflict should not deter the Court from pronouncing on a resolution's validity. Even if other organs do not comply with an order by the Court, rules of international law may still be characterized as obligatory even
when the possibility of applying them coercively, in the context of non-compliance, is limited or absent. This becomes a difficulty of legal efficacy, not legal validity.<sup><a href="#one97">197</a></sup> If, as I suggested in the previous section, both resolution 731 (1992) and resolution 748 (1992) were invalid, then
the case would have been an appropriate occasion for the indication of the provisional relief requested. No legitimate purpose would be gained by insisting that Libya, under Article 14(1) of the Montreal Convention, continue for six months a process that the United States and the United Kingdom had already dismissed as being out of the question. Even with a finding that both resolutions were <i>prima facie</i> valid, the Court could presumably have indicated some form of <i>proprio motu</i> provisional relief that would have complied with the resolutions, the Charter, and the Montreal Convention.
<p>
These disputes over the proper role of the Court show its need for a clearer sense of function. As the United Nations nears its first half-century, we still struggle to understand the nature of that union, and to frame the principles that will continue to guide its development. The confusion stems from its dual function as both an instrument of the United Nations and an organ of international law. How should these attributes be reconciled? <cite>Lockerbie</cite> shows the difficulty in preserving both of the Court's roles. These difficulties will only be exacerbated by Security Council ascendancy and the desire for an organ of oversight.<sup><a href="#one98">198</a></sup> As Professor Gross has concluded, what response is appropriate will depend on (a) the degree to which the United Nations becomes a truly universal international organization; (b) the evolution of the current organization from one of coordination to one of integration; and (c) as a consequence, the degree to which international law must adjust to and absorb United Nations law or <i>vice versa</i>.<sup><a href="#one99">199</a></sup>
<p>
<h3>V. Epilogue</h3>

On 31 March 1992, the Security Council voted to impose a ban on air travel and arms sales against Libya effective 15 April 1992. The sanctions did not affect the export of oil, Libya's main economic resource. As with resolution 748 (1992), ten members voted in favour of imposing sanctions and five abstained.<sup><a href="#twohundred">200</a></sup> Yet Libya refused to yield the two suspects, apparently because of Qaddafi's fear that, as part of a Western effort to topple his r&eacute;gime, their prosecution would lead to new indictments implicating him or others close to him.<sup><a href="#two01">201</a></sup> Mixed with this refusal, however, have been periodic hints of cooperation. Libyan Justice Minister Ibrahim Bakar reportedly indicated that Libya would not block the departure of the two accused if they decided to stand trial in Scotland or the United States.<sup><a href="#two02">202</a></sup> Libya also promised to give the United Kingdom specific information about Libya's dealings with the Provisional Irish Republican Army; this move apparently responded to a requirement in the United Nations sanctions that Libya demonstrate that it has severed ties with terrorist groups.<sup><a href="#two03">203</a></sup>
<p>
Since the sanctions come up for review every 120 days, the Security Council has continued them at four-month intervals in the face of Libya's continued failure to surrender the two accused.<sup><a href="#two04">204</a></sup> The only further response garnered by the renewed sanctions was Libya's
closure of its land borders for three days in January 1993.<sup><a href="#two05">205</a></sup> The new administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton, impatient with Libyan inaction, threatened to stiffen sanctions.<sup><a href="#two06">206</a></sup> U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher indicated that he would press allies to impose a global oil embargo, freeze Libyan assets abroad, and ban the sale of oil-related equipment to Libya. The proposal reportedly met stiff resistance from Britain and France, who believed that the Arab world would not accept new sanctions.<sup><a href="#two07">207</a></sup>
<p>
On 13 August 1993, upon the fourth renewal of the United Nations sanctions, the United States, Britain, and France issued a new warning which gave Libya until 1 October 1993 to surrender the two accused.<sup><a href="#two08">208</a></sup> The statement, read before the Security Council by U.S. representative Madeleine K. Albright, stated that if the suspects were not handed over by this new deadline &quot;we will table a resolution strengthening the sanctions in key oil-related, financial and technological areas.&quot;<sup><a href="#two09">209</a></sup> Although no details of these new measures were given, they still did not contemplate banning the sale of Libyan oil. Predictably, Libya rejected the new deadline two days later through a statement from its Foreign Ministry. The statement also reiterated Libya's readiness to discuss the issue with the Security Council and the three Western states in order to find a venue for an &quot;equitable and fair trial&quot; for the suspects.<sup><a href="#two10">210</a></sup> On 19 August 1993, Qaddafi himself again offered to open talks with the Clinton administration.<sup><a href="#two11">211</a></sup> Qaddafi was even reported to be suggesting that the two accused be tried in Canada, headquarters of the International Air Transport Association.<sup><a href="#two12">212</a></sup>
<p>
The October deadline did not achieve compliance. Scottish lawyers Alistair Duff and Lord Macaulay confirmed in September 1993, that they had been appointed to represent the two accused and would fly to Libya in early October to be briefed by their clients.<sup><a href="#two13">213</a></sup> Yet Libya still equivocated. A forty-page letter delivered to United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on 14
September 1993 stated that the two accused might stand trial in Scotland if the procedures were fair and if the sanctions were lifted. The significance of this apparent concession was qualified by the Libyan assertion that the accused would need to &quot;be persuaded to stand trial under the Scottish legal system.&quot;<sup><a href="#two14">214</a></sup> The document could therefore have represented
reasonable questions leading up to a handover or reasons for non-compliance.<sup><a href="#two15">215</a></sup> Either way, the United States, Britain, and France acceeded to requests by Boutros-Ghali that they delay the imposition of new economic sanctions.<sup><a href="#two16">216</a></sup>
<p>
At the time of writing, therefore, it appears that the dispute is merely entering a new phase of stalemate. A team of international lawyers representing the two accused has now advised them not to surrender to Scottish authorities for trial, citing a &quot;grave concern&quot; that pretrial publicity could prevent them from receiving a fair hearing.<sup><a href="#two17">217</a></sup> If the two accused nevertheless elect to stand trial in Scotland, it will form theconclusion to a deeply flawed process, one in which the Security
Council disregarded municipal and treaty law by demanding the extradition of two Libyan nationals to a country where at least one justice of the Court feels a fair trial is unlikely.<sup><a href="#two18">218</a></sup>
<p>
<h3>VI. Concluding Remarks</h3>

The creators of the International Court of Justice held high hopes for the role that it could play in substituting the rule of law and justice for the rule of force:
<blockquote>
On the basis of the texts proposed for the Charter [of the United Nations] and the Statute [of the Court], the First Committee ventures to foresee a significant role for the new Court in the international relations of the future. The judicial process will have a central place in the plans of the United Nations for the settlement
of international disputes by peaceful means ... . A long road has been travelled in the effort to enthrone law as the guide for theconduct of states in their relations one with another. A new milepost is now erected along that road. In establishing the International Court of Justice, the United Nations hold before a war-stricken world the beacons of Justice and Law and offer the possibility of substituting orderly judicial processes for the vicissitudes of war and the reign of brutal force.<sup><a href="#two19">219</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The decision by that Court in <cite>Lockerbie</cite> seems far removed from these lofty ambitions. Instead, we are left with the vision of U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering that &quot;neither Libya nor indeed any other State can seek to hide support for international terrorism behind traditional principles of international law and State practice.&quot;<sup><a href="#two20">220</a></sup> If it is true, as one observer has remarked, that &quot;the principal problem the Court faces is the current perception that its
decisions turn ultimately on political, rather than legal, considerations,&quot; the <cite>Lockerbie</cite> judgments have done little to ameliorate the problem.<sup><a href="#two21">221</a></sup>
<p>
Had the Court indicated provisional measures, the United States and the United Kingdom would not have been left without recourse. Article 14 of the Montreal Convention directs that any dispute shall on the request of either party be submitted to arbitration. If this fails to reach agreement, either party may then refer the dispute to the Court for resolution. A judgment by the Court would then be eligible for enforcement by the Security Council and other United Nations organs. With hindsight it is clear that any indication of
provisional relief would have initiated a period of negotiation between the parties, likely with a view to finding a mutually agreeable jurisdiction for the trial which all three litigants conceded should take place. This is almost exactly what has happened anyway. While the propriety of indicating provisional measures turns on many factors, it can at least be observed that the Court's failure to indicate such measures did nothing to advance the resolution of this dispute. At the same time, though, <cite>Lockerbie</cite> threatens to minimize the rule of law in the post-Cold War international system, to restrict the Court to hearing only questions that are politically non-controversial,<sup><a href="#two22">222</a></sup> and
to convert instruments of international law into tools of convenience, rather than treaties of necessity.<sup><a href="#two23">223</a></sup> This latter danger is particularly troubling given that the United Nations Charter includes as one of its ends the maintenance of &quot;respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law.&quot;<sup><a href="#two24">224</a></sup>
<p>
Some solace may be found in the judgments' insistence that the disposition of the provisional application will not affect the ultimate disposition on the merits. However, the degree to which the Court's refusal to indicate provisional measures anticipates its full decision on the merits is uncertain.<sup><a href="#two25">225</a></sup> Libya has accordingly kept the case alive for the moment, and the deadline for its memorial was 20 December 1993. The United States and the United Kingdom have until 20 June 1995 for their counter-memorials.<sup><a href="#two26">226</a></sup> The full decision will deny the majority the luxury of avoiding core issues by refusing to engage the merits, and it will doubtless be one of the most juridically important that the Court has delivered.
<p>
In the meantime, we have been given a spectacular illustration of the failure of international enforcement. Advocates of an international criminal court have found new support in Libya's refusal to comply with the Security Council's resolutions.<sup><a href="#two27">227</a></sup> At first blush, this failure of enforcement affects only the efficacy, rather than the validity, of international law. In Kelsen's words, efficacy of law asks whether the norms that are meant to shape conduct are actually applied and obeyed. Validity is instead concerned with whether those norms are legitimate, whether conduct should conform to those norms.<sup><a href="#two28">228</a></sup> Despite this conceptual distinction, though, an
interdependence exists between the two: &quot;[O]nly a legal order the norms of which are generally obeyed and applied is considered valid. It is not necessary that all the norms of this order be always and
without exception obeyed or applied; but it is necessary that it be on the whole efficacious.&quot;<sup><a href="#two29">229</a></sup> The failure to indicate provisional measures may therefore detract from the
validity of the international legal order in two respects: its erosion of the rule of law, and its demand of efficacy from a system seemingly unable or unwilling to provide it. 
<p>
Then-U.S. President George Bush, in a 1990 address to the United Nations, called for a &quot;new partnership of nations ... based on consultation, cooperation and collective action ... . united by principle and the rule of law ...&quot;<sup><a href="#two30">230</a></sup> I have argued that if the international system of the next century is to include a respect for the rule of law, it will fall to the Court to enforce that respect in the last resort. The mechanism discussed would be to allow United Nations organs to determine their own competence in the first instance but to have the Court curtail their flagrant operational anomalies by holding them to deferential tests of validity. This model of review would of course not require the Security Council, in a time of crisis, to delay its response until the Court provided the &quot;go-ahead.&quot; My proposal would, however, be willing to subject the course of action adopted by the Security Council to review by the Court after the fact.<sup><a href="#two31">231</a></sup> Even the limited review that I have advocated will entail a stronger activism by the Court than that it has traditionally evinced. This activism will, in turn, render even more important the composition of the Court. Current proposals to expand General Assembly voting rights and the veto also reflect a desire to enhance legitimacy and validity by increasing the number of stakeholders in a given decision.<sup><a href="#two32">232</a></sup> An effective international rule of law will also require an articulation of its principles---which currently lie in part explicitly and in large part interstitially within the Charter and the principles of international law. This is not to minimize the complementarity of the roles played by United Nations organs. The important question that remains, though, is what happens when the organs fail to complement each other, when (for example) the Security Council fails to be sensitive to both positive law and justice.
<p>
It is common to dichotomize the rule of law from political expedience based on the concept of national interest. Realists, minimizing the role of law in international relations, regard all international disputes as political disputes. Attempts to inject a normative legal order into this system are illusory and time-consuming diversions. Conversely, other commentators advocate the compulsory adjudication of every international dispute. Although all conflicts, they argue, are political in character, this does not exclude the possibility of treating the dispute as legal. Conflicts are therefore political with respect to the interests they involve and legal with respect to the normative order controlling those interests.<sup><a href="#two33">233</a></sup> Shared between these schools, then, are the recognitions that political and
legal disputes are interrelated to one degree or another, and that law and diplomacy are mutually complementary.<sup><a href="#two34">234</a></sup> This suggests that through a system of functional complementarity grounded in validity, expedience, and the rule of law are not inevitably antagonistic.<sup><a href="#two35">235</a></sup>
<p>
The realists will complain that this emphasis on the rule of law substitutes abstract idealism for the political and power bases that drive international relations. Yet discord and conflict will be the only result of any attempt by a group of member states to judge the conduct of another unless an independent, mutually agreeable set of standards can be consulted.<sup><a href="#two36">236</a></sup> As Professor Eagleton notes, &quot;[I]f the United Nations is to maintain any pretension of being a legal order, of seeking to carry out its purposes in terms of its fundamental law, it cannot do so by arriving at whatever decision the emotions of the moment demand and then asserting that the action taken was legal because it was taken.&quot;<sup><a href="#two37">237</a></sup> The rule of law therefore aspires to provide part of a set of standards on which to base legality. A desire for the rule of law in United Nations organs does not dictate a particular substantive outcome; it instead mandates an effort on behalf of the relevant organ(s) to achieve justice through dispassionate application of the rule of law and the principles that inform it. The goal is not to supplant <i>realpolitik</i> with abstractions, but to find a point of convergence where long-range interests can be defined based on power derived not only from expedience but also from principle and order. As United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskj&ouml;ld observed in 1955,
<blockquote>
... in the longer view, it is surely in the interest of all Member States to restrict as much as possible the sphere where sheer strength is an argument and to extend as widely as possible the area ruled by considerations of law and justice. In an interdependent world, a greater degree of authority and effectiveness in international law will be a safeguard, not a threat, to the freedom and independence of national States.<sup><a href="#two38">238</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Because states are autonomous and sovereign only in virtue of international law, every increment of strength in that law is bound to make more secure the independence of states.<sup><a href="#two39">239</a></sup> Similarly, by acting in accordance with principle the Security Council can strengthen, with cumulative effect, its own capabilities in future disputes.<sup><a href="#two40">240</a></sup>

A Swiss firm had manufactured the twenty MST-13 timers for Libyan intelligence agents. Ten of the timers were confiscated in Senegal, one more through a bungled assault on a U.S. embassy in Togo, and a twelfth in the wreckage of another bombing: French Union de transports a&eacute;riens (UTA) Flight 772 on 19 September 1989.

The jumpsuit featured the same blast damage as a pair of patterned pants with the label &quot;Yorkie Trading Company 0005.&quot; Investigators travelled to Malta and, incredibly, used the labels to trace the clothing to the store in Sliema where it had been purchased. The shopkeeper could vividly recall the customer, who randomly bought a child's jumpsuit, a pair of herringbone pants, a cardigan sweater, and an old tweed jacket. Because it was raining that day, the man also purchased an umbrella. When investigators reexamined the five umbrellas recovered from the plane wreckage, they discovered only one with blast damage. Police photographs later allowed the shopkeeper to identify Libyan national Abdel Baset Ali Mohamed al-Megrahi as the man in his store on 7 December 1988. See A.

A French judicial inquiry into the flight's destruction placed heavy presumptions of guilt on several Libyan nationals, and the timers used in both the UTA and the Pan Am explosions matched. My discussion focuses on the United States and Britain, though, since they were the primary complainants in the Pan Am 103 dispute.

<li><a name="one06">But see the opinion of Judge Morelli</a> in <cite>Certain Expenses</cite>: &quot;[T]he failure of [an] act to conform to the rules concerning competence has no influence on the validity of the act, which amounts to saying that each organ of the United Nations is the judge of its own competence.&quot; See <i>ibid.</i> at 223--4, para. 8 (Morelli, J., sep. op.). Judge Morelli appears to mean that each organ is the <i>final</i> judge of its own competence. This conclusion, I submit, is irreconcilable with his earlier assertion that United Nations organs can indeed act invalidly (see note 95, <i>supra</i>). Appointing each organ to be the only judge of its competence denies any limits to that competence, and thus denies the ability to act in an invalid manner.

<li><a name="one98">For example,</a> in March 1993, Bosnia-Herzegovina applied to the Court for an indication of provisional measures. One of the grounds advanced for the application was that the customary doctrine of <i>ultra vires</i> prevented the Security Council from imposing an arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina through resolution 713 (1991). While the Court did indicate provisional measures on 8 April 1993, it steered clear of the <i>ultra vires</i> submission and made no ruling on the matter. Nevertheless, that this question arose twice in one year illustrates the need for principles on which such claims can be adjudicated.

<h1>Controlling Racial Discrimination in Policing: A Discussion Paper
<p> 
KEVIN DAVIS</h1>
<p><br>
<center><h3>ABSTRACT / <a href="../utlr51-2/davis.htm">Fulltext</a></h3></center>

There is a widespread perception among racial minorities that the Canadian criminal justice system in general and
the police in particular discriminate against racial minorities. This paper is about the role that the legal system has to play in regulating racial discrimination in policing. The author refers to the literature providing empirical evidence that the police discriminate against racial minorities when making decisions involving allocation of resources and whether to stop, search, arrest or use force against suspects. He also discusses how various legal mechanisms might be used to control each of these forms of discrimination. These mechanisms include: the police complaints process; disciplinary proceedings under police codes of conduct; the criminal law; human rights legislation; the <cite>Charter</cite>; and, coroner's inquests. The discussion suggests that further research is required on the problems of proof, remedies and standing involved in using the legal system to regulate racial discrimination in
policing.
<P>
L'opinon est r&eacute;pandue chez les minorit&eacute;s raciales selon laquelle le syst&egrave;me de justice criminelle et plus particuli&egrave;rement la police font preuve de discrimination dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions. Cet article traite du r&ocirc;le que peut jouer le syst&egrave;me judiciaire pour restreindre la discrimination raciale dans le service policier. L'auteur fait r&eacute;f&eacute;rence &agrave; des &eacute;tudes empiriques qui d&eacute;montrent qu'il y a de la discrimination envers les minorit&eacute;s raciales dans la r&eacute;partition des ressources polici&egrave;res et dans les d&eacute;cisions de fouiller un suspect, de le fouiller, de l'arr&ecirc;ter ou d'avoir recours &agrave; la force contre lui. L'auteur consid&egrave;re &eacute;galement la possibilit&eacute; d'employer divers m&eacute;canismes juridiques pour contr&ocirc;ler ces formes de discrimination. Parmi ces m&eacute;canismes on compte les proc&eacute;dures de plainte contre la police; les recours fond&eacute;s sur les codes de conduite de la police, sur le droit criminel, sur les lois concernant les droits de la personne ou sur la <cite>Charte canadienne</cite>; et les enqu&ecirc;tes du coroner. Il ressort de la discussion qu'il faudra enqu&ecirc;ter davantage sur les difficult&eacute;s reli&eacute;es &agrave; la preuve, aux r&eacute;parations et &agrave; la qualit&eacute; pour agir que soul&egrave;ve le recours au syst&egrave;me judiciaire pour restreindre la discrimination raciale dans le service policier.

<h1>The Limits of Free Trade: Sovereignty, Environmental Protection, and NAFTA
<p> 
MICHAEL W. DUNLEAVY</h1>
<p><br>
<center><h3>ABSTRACT</h3></center>

A tension exists between the ongoing drive toward free trade in the world economy and the principle of state
sovereignty. As pressures to remove trade barriers increase, domestic law-making abilities are compromised. This article discusses the trade-sovereignty conflict, using domestic environmental concerns as a framework for discussion and using the North American Free Trade Agreement as a specific example of the problem. The nature of the interaction between trade and sovereignty is surveyed from theoretical and historical perspectives and some permutations of the clash between trade imperatives and sovereign choices, as embodied by environmental protection goals, are illustrated in both hypothetical and real-world scenarios. The potential for such a clash between
trade and environment in NAFTA is examined. Various approaches to the resolution of conflicts between the goals of free trade and those of environmental protection are surveyed, including dispute resolution and harmonization, and there is discussion of the applicability of these approaches in NAFTA.
<p>
Il existe une tension entre les efforts qui se poursuivent en faveur du libre-&eacute;change dans l'&eacute;conomie mondiale et le principe de la souverainet&eacute; d'&Eacute;tat. &Agrave; mesure qu'augmentent les efforts pour &eacute;liminer les barri&egrave;res commerciales, la capacit&eacute; l&eacute;gislative nationale se voit limiter.
Cet article fait le point sur le conflit entre le commerce et la souverainet&eacute; dans le cadre des pr&eacute;occupations environnementales nationales et donne en exemple l'Accord de libre-&eacute;change
nord-am&eacute;ricain. L'auteur &eacute;tudie l'interaction entre le commerce et la souverainet&eacute; dans une perspective th&eacute;orique et historique. De plus, pour illustrer l'opposition entre les imp&eacute;ratifs du  commerce et les choix souverains, tels que concr&eacute;tis&eacute;s dans les objectifs de la protection de l'environnement, l'auteur a recours &agrave; des sc&eacute;narios hypoth&eacute;tiques et r&eacute;els. Il examine par la suite les possibilit&eacute;s d'un tel conflit opposant le commerce et l'environnement dans le cadre de l'AL&Eacute;NA. L'auteur passe en revue diverses fa&ccedil;ons de concilier les buts respectifs du libre-&eacute;change et de la protection environnementale, y compris les processus de r&egrave;glement des diff&eacute;rends et d'harmonisation. Il discute aussi de la pertinence de ces approches dans le cadre de
l'AL&Eacute;NA.

<h1> Imperium by the Back Door: The <cite>Astreinte</cite> and the Enforcement of Contractual Obligations in France
<p> 
 M.P. MICHELL</h1>
<p><br>
<center><h3>ABSTRACT</h3></center>

The author examines the historical development, theoretical foundations, and recent legislative grounding of the
<cite>astreinte</cite>, a judicial order in French law used for the specific enforcement of obligations and civil judgments. The author identifies contradictions between the theoretical purity of the <cite>Civil Code</cite> and the need for effective remedies, and shows how French courts, jurists, and legislators have attempted to deal with this conflict. The <cite>astreinte</cite> originated in judicial practice and its history has been driven by the courts.
<p>
L'auteur examine le d&eacute;veloppement historique, le fondement th&eacute;orique et la base l&eacute;gislative r&eacute;cente de l'astreinte, un genre d'ordonnance judiciaire en droit fran&ccedil;ais qui sert &agrave; l'ex&eacute;cution d'obligations et de jugements civils. Il fait &eacute;tat de certaines contradictions entre la puret&eacute; th&eacute;orique du Code civil et la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de pr&eacute;voir des recours efficaces, et indique la fa&ccedil;on par laquelle les tribunaux, juristes et l&eacute;gislateurs fran&ccedil;ais ont tent&eacute; de r&eacute;soudre le probl&egrave;me. L'astreinte a son origine dans la pratique judiciaire et son
&eacute;volution est guid&eacute;e par les tribunaux.

<h1>Refugee Status for Female Circumcision Fugitives: Building a Canadian Precedent
<p> 
VALERIE OOSTERVELD</h1>
<p><br>
<center><h3>ABSTRACT / <a href="../utlr51-2/oosterv.htm">Fulltext</a></h3></center>

The French Commission for Appeals of Refugees has recently recognized that female circumcision may be considered as a form of persecution under the <cite>United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees</cite>. It is conceivable, and likely, that the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board will follow this precedent in a similar case. The Chair of the Immigration and Refugee Board has recently released guidelines for assessing whether women fearing gender-related persecution qualify as refugees.

<h1>Refugee Status for Female Circumcision Fugitives: Building a Canadian Precedent<br>
VALERIE OOSTERVELD</h1>

<i>The French Commission for Appeals of Refugees has recently recognized that female circumcision may be considered as a form of persecution under the</i> United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees<i>. It is conceivable, and likely, that the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board will follow this precedent in a similar case. The Chair of the Immigration and Refugee Board has recently released guidelines for assessing whether women fearing gender-related persecution qualify as refugees. These guidelines
provide the most hope for claimants fleeing circumcision. The existing case law is useful insofar as it provides the Board with clues on how to approach a gender-related case. This article attempts to present the context of female circumcision and document the arguments that one would make on behalf of a claimant fleeing female circumcision to prove that she should be given refugee status.

<p><br>
Recently, the French Commission for Appeals of Refugees became the first judicial authority to recognize female circumcision<sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup> as a form of persecution under the terms of the 1951 <cite>United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees</cite>.<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup> This landmark ruling has now set a precedent for the determination of claims by
fugitives from female circumcision in other countries that have a similar refugee determination process. It is likely that a similar case will present itself in the near future to the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board (&quot;IRB&quot; or &quot;Board&quot;). This possibility necessitates the development of a thoughtful and informed approach to such a claim. The likelihood of a female circumcision case succeeding in Canada has been greatly improved with the federal government's recent announcement that guidelines have been issued to the IRB for deciding cases of gender-based persecution. The aim of this article is to outline and to analyze the arguments that may be used in such a case. 
<p>
The first section of this article describes the <cite>Aminata Diop</cite> case, and the context of female circumcision generally. The description of female circumcision is necessarily lengthy, and is meant to aid those with little knowledge of the practice and its history. The definition of &quot;refugee&quot; is then explored, especially the grounds enumerated in the definition on which a woman may claim gender-based persecution. The ramifications of the recent guidelines issued by the Immigration and Refugee Board regarding female refugees are then discussed. Finally, evidentiary problems that may arise in a Canadian case are set out. These considerations, taken together,  lead to the conclusion that it is plausible for a Canadian court or refugee tribunal to recognize the threat of, or practice of, female circumcision as a form of persecution and women facing this persecution as refugees within the existing legislation, and certainly within the recent guidelines on the definition of `refugee.'  
<p>
<h3><cite>Aminata Diop</cite> Case<sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup></h3>

The parents of 20-year-old Aminata Diop of Mali arranged a marriage for her to the son of her father's friend.
Before she could marry him, however, her family and fianc&eacute; insisted that she be circumcised.<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup> When she refused to undergo this procedure, her father beat her. Diop did not want to be circumcised for many reasons, one of which was that she recognized the physical danger circumcision could put her in: her friend in Mali had died three days after her circumcision was done. Diop fled from Mali to France in October 1991 and made an unprecedented request of the French government for asylum as a refugee under the terms of the <cite>Geneva Convention</cite>. Her initial request was rejected, and she appealed that decision. 
<p>
On appeal, the French Commission for Appeals of Refugees recognized that the threat or practice of genital mutilation is a form of persecution and that Diop consequently fell within the definition of &quot;refugee&quot; set out in the <cite>Geneva Convention</cite>. However, she was denied refugee status because she had failed to appeal for help from authorities in Mali and therefore had not exhausted local remedies. The Commission acknowledged, but did not find it determinative, that the Malian authorities are guilty of tolerating female circumcision and probably would not have done anything for Diop. Diop, to prove that her fear of persecution was real, introduced as evidence a letter in which Diop's mother warned
her that she would be in danger if she returned to her village. Because the letter was dictated by Diop's illiterate mother rather than written by her, it was considered hearsay and was deemed inadmissible. A further appeal was filed in late November 1991, challenging the higher court's ambiguous position that genital mutilation constitutes persecution when &quot;the parties concerned had been personally exposed to the operation against their will.&quot; The actual operation is presumably the confrontation that a refugee claimant would hope to avoid, and if the refugee tribunals construe this comment narrowly, it is possible that the French authorities would only allow as refugees those women who were forced to undergo
circumcision. Those women fleeing the threat of circumcision, such as Aminata Diop, could be left out.
<p>
If a case similar to Diop's arises in Canada, it will be necessary to understand what female circumcision is and why it continues today. Vast numbers of women around the world are pressured to undergo this procedure every year, and there is a need for recognition of those who flee this pressure. The following
description of female circumcision sets out the context of the procedure and why it continues to be performed today, even after many groups and governments have expressed their opposition to the
practice. It is important to comprehend the various factors that affect a woman's decision to flee the practice of female circumcision in her community, because a court or tribunal must be made aware of how these factors can be viewed as persecution.
<p>
<h3>What Is Female Circumcision?</h3>

Female circumcision, also referred to as genital mutilation, is a traditional practice that involves the cutting away of all or part of the external female genitalia---the clitoris, the labia minora, and the labia majora.<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup> There are varying practices with regard to the amount of genitalia cut away.<sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup> The least severe form is called ritualistic circumcision, where the clitoris is merely nicked. The second form is called &quot;sunna&quot; by Muslims, and involves the removal of the outer layer of skin over the clitoris.  Sunna has been equated with male circumcision since the clitoris itself is not usually damaged. A third, more severe form of circumcision is called excision or clitoridectomy. In some countries, this is also called &quot;sunna&quot; circumcision. This is the most common form of female circumcision, and involves the removal of the entire clitoris and usually the labia
minora. The most severe form is called Pharaonic circumcision, or infibulation. In this procedure, common in countries such as Sudan,<sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup> virtually all of the external female genitalia are removed. With this type of circumcision, the entire clitoris and labia minora are cut or scraped away, as well as some of the labia majora, keeping enough skin on the labia majora to sew the lips together with acacia tree thorns. This process leaves only a small opening (roughly the size of a pinhole) for the passing of urine and menstrual fluid. In the most severe Pharaonic circumcisions,<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup> not even skin is left. With infibulation, the woman's or girl's legs are then tied
together so that she is immobilized while the wound heals.
<p>
The age at which female circumcision is done varies from country to country. In countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Mali, as in Aminata Diop's case, circumcision is performed on women on their wedding night or after they have had their first child.<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup> In Mauritania, Nigeria, and Ethiopia, the operation is performed on very young babies.<sup><a href="#ten">10</a></sup> Other countries circumcise girls at age 8 or 9.
<p>
Female circumcision occurs all over the world but is mostly seen in a band of countries stretching east from Mali, Senegal, and Sierre Leone in Africa to Oman in the Middle East. It is estimated that 98  percent of all Somalian women have been circumcised (about 4.1 million women).<sup><a href="#eleven">11</a></sup> In Ethiopia, the estimate is 90  percent of all women, which translates into roughly 23.3 million women. In West and Central Africa, the  percentages of women who have undergone female circumcision is lower, although where the population is high, the actual numbers are high: Nigeria is at 50 percent (29.7 million women) and Ghana at 30 percent (2.25 million women). Hosken estimates that the total number of women who have been circumcised in Africa is around 110.53 million. She does not include in this number those African countries where only a small  percentage of the population practises female circumcision (Cameroon, Congo, Zaire, and Tanzania, for example), so the actual total is 2 to 3 million higher.<sup><a href="#twelve">12</a></sup> In addition, female circumcision is &quot;exported&quot; to other countries, such as the Netherlands,<sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup> France,<sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup> and England,<sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup> as well as Canada<sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup> and the United States. Female circumcision is also practised in the Arab Peninsula and in the Persian Gulf, while a less damaging form is practised by devout Muslims in areas of Malaysia and Indonesia.<sup><a href="#seventeen">17</a></sup> Thus, a woman escaping female circumcision could be from almost anywhere, although she is most likely to come from a country, such as Sudan or Somalia, where the vast majority of women are circumcised, and from a society that does not offer any alternatives.
<p>
Why does female circumcision happen?  There are many religious, cultural, and health justifications given for the procedure by those that practise it. The most pervasively cited reason given for the practice is that it allows for the sexual control of females.<sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup> Female circumcision is believed to discourage promiscuity by reducing a woman's desire for sexual intercourse: it is &quot;the most effective means to keep the girls' virginity intact.&quot;<sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a></sup> Lightfoot-Klein notes that circumcision serves not only to protect a woman from aggressive males, but also to protect her from her own sexuality.<sup><a href="#twenty">20</a></sup> The belief that uncircumcised women cannot help but exhibit an unbridled and voracious appetite for promiscuous sex is prevalent in all
societies that practise female circumcision.<sup><a href="#twenty1">21</a></sup> Because the only lifestyle deemed appropriate for an uncircumcised woman is prostitution, an uncircumcised woman is considered unmarriageable.<sup><a href="#twenty2">22</a></sup> In contrast, a circumcised woman (that is, a sexually controlled woman) is seen as a benefit to her family's honour and social position.
<p>
Another reason given for circumcision is that it is demanded by religion. Although Hosken notes that female circumcision is not advocated in any formal religious teachings,<sup><a href="#twenty3">23</a></sup> it is widely believed by those that practise circumcision that it is required by their religion. Female circumcision is largely found in African Islamic countries, and to a lesser extent among Animists, African Coptic Christians, and a small sect of Ethiopian Jews called Fallashas.<sup><a href="#twenty4">24</a></sup> It appears that the heavy emphasis on both the physical state of virginity within the Muslim religion and the importance of patrilineage leads to an institutionalization of female circumcision in some regions as the best method of controlling &quot;purity.&quot;  In this way, then, religion becomes inseparable from cultural values:
<blockquote>
From the standpoint of honor and of Islamic norms of modesty, female sexuality is threatening. Socialized to believe that infibulation offers a physiological and social sanctuary from the threat inherent in their sexuality, women remain its greatest advocates, gladly subjecting their beloved daughters and granddaughters to the ordeal in order to protect them and the patrilineage. The latter result is of utmost importance to traditional women, because the patrilineage is their immediate and primary source of identity and security ... in what they are taught to envision as a dangerous and hostile world outside the walls of the
family compound. Being more vulnerable than men (i.e., without institutionalized power or authority) they have an equal, if not greater interest in safeguarding the lineage's position in the larger society.<sup><a href="#twenty5">25</a></sup> 
</blockquote>
The justification of religion is intimately linked to the upholding of cultural values and to the maintenance of a certain power structure within society.
<p>
A further reason given for female circumcision is that the procedure will improve a woman's health and appearance. It is widely believed that the clitoris, if left in its natural state, will grow to the size of a penis.<sup><a href="#twenty6">26</a></sup> This possibility is considered extremely unfeminine
and ugly. It is also believed that a woman's genitalia, if left uncut, will produce offensive discharges: an uncut woman is considered polluted and unclean.<sup><a href="#twenty7">27</a></sup> Another reason given under the rubric of health is that circumcision increases the fertility of women and that it has other healing powers.<sup><a href="#twenty8">28</a></sup> Finally, in some cultures, the clitoris is considered poisonous<sup><a href="#twenty9">29</a></sup> or evil and therefore must be removed. For example, in Southern Nigeria, &quot;[t]he clitoris is considered to be a dangerous organ which can cause symbolic or spiritual injury to the baby.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty">30</a></sup> 
<p>
Female circumcision has been done for thousands of years,<sup><a href="#thirty1">31</a></sup> and is
therefore considered an important tradition. Slack describes several studies in which tradition was the reason given most often for why circumcision continues despite education campaigns that explain that the health and fertility beliefs are myths.<sup><a href="#thirty2">32</a></sup> Dareer notes that &quot;rites and traditional practices are taken for granted and people do not expect to be asked `why' they actually participate in them.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty3">33</a></sup> Very often, traditions are so firmly woven into the social fabric of the culture in which circumcision is practised that people feel powerless to stop the practice.<sup><a href="#thirty4">34</a></sup> Female circumcision is seen by some as a custom much larger than the people who practise it.
<p>
Why does the practice of female circumcision continue? Some reasons have been hinted at above, such as the strength of tradition. A lack of education among the women who erroneously believe in the health benefits of circumcision also contributes to the perpetuation of the practice, since these women teach their children the myths their mothers taught them. Illiteracy plays a role, since men and women who cannot read must depend on what is said by others, such as their religious leaders, for information.<sup><a href="#thirty5">35</a></sup> They cannot read the Koran or other writings to determine whether female circumcision is demanded of them by their religion. Furthermore, there is often a psychological need to maintain tradition: the control women have over their daughters and daughters-in-law in terms of when the procedure is to be done is often the only control a woman can assert in a patriarchal society.<sup><a href="#thirty6">36</a></sup> The practice of female circumcision as a tradition is usually so deeply ingrained in a society that it serves as a power that helps to bind the community together at the same time as it provides a source of cultural identity that is crucial in small communities.<sup><a href="#thirty7">37</a></sup> Thus, any attempt to remove an identifier such as female circumcision without having something equally respected with which to replace it will face opposition from those affected. The concern is that communities faced with uncertainty will disintegrate with the removal of a central custom.
<p>
On a more individual level, the pressure to undergo circumcision can be overwhelming. Where the practice is widespread among the group one identifies with, one will hesitate to condemn the practice for fear of ostracism. Onadeko and Adekunle describe how, in Nigeria, even educated women opposed to female circumcision underwent the procedure because of family and social pressures.<sup><a href="#thirty8">38</a></sup> The practice is often surrounded with very positive rituals and attention
that women and girls do not regularly receive.<sup><a href="#thirty9">39</a></sup> To eliminate female circumcision could also eliminate these rituals, and the opportunity they provide for women to feel respected. Those midwives whose job it is to perform circumcisions and to attend to births oppose any change in tradition that threatens the source of their livelihood. In a society where women do not have many roles beyond daughter, wife, mother, midwife, and prostitute, the loss of &quot;business&quot; for a midwife due to the elimination of circumcision can be devastating.<sup><a href="#forty">40</a></sup> All of these sources of pressure add to the perpetuation of the practice, and also illuminate how many aspects of a society would have to change in order to eliminate circumcision.
<p>
Female circumcision is a very complicated practice, one that must be understood in the context of culture, religion, and tradition. In this article, the references to those fleeing female circumcision will be to women such as Aminata Diop. The reference is not to children, even though they also suffer circumcisions, because
children are affected by different laws, such as the <cite>United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</cite>.<sup><a href="#forty1">41</a></sup> This article explores the possibility that women who flee their villages to escape from female circumcision<sup><a href="#forty2">42</a></sup> are <cite>Geneva Convention</cite> refugees within the context of Canadian immigration law.
<p>
<h3>The Refugee Determination Process</h3>

The definition of a refugee in international law can be found in the <cite>Geneva Convention</cite>. Canada has codified the <cite>Convention</cite>'s definition into s. 2(1) of the <cite>Immigration Act</cite>. Section 2(1) reads:
<blockquote>
&quot;Convention Refugee&quot; means any person who<br>
(a) by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,<br>
<dd>(i) is outside the country of the person's nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.<sup><a href="#forty3">43</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Women do not, as a class, fit within this definition. Grounds for fleeing gender-based persecution are not enumerated. Recommendations have been made by the international legal community to change this. The United Nations High Commission of Refugees commented in 1985 that states, 
<blockquote>
in the exercise of their sovereignty, are free to adopt the interpretation that women asylum-seekers who face harsh or inhuman treatment due to their having transgressed the social mores of the society in which they live may be considered as a &quot;particular social group&quot; within the meaning of Article 1 A(2) of the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention.<sup><a href="#forty4">44</a></sup> 
</blockquote>
The need for a category that includes gender persecution arises from the fact that women have not, in the past, fit especially well within the existing categories. 
<p>
Worldwide, women are most active in the private, non-regulated, sphere of life. The private sphere is defined differently by different cultures but, in general, women are much less likely to be involved in traditional politics or in the publicly active religious, racial, nationalist, or social groups whose persecution or lack of
state protection is publicized.<sup><a href="#forty5">45</a></sup> As a result, in Canada the majority of refugee claimants are single men or men with families because their persecution is easier to identify.<sup><a href="#forty6">46</a></sup> The effect of this is to create a body of Canadian case law based on male claims such that female-specific definitions of &quot;social group&quot; or &quot;political opinion&quot; have not been created.<sup><a href="#forty7">47</a></sup> To date, there have not been any refugee cases in Canada that have dealt with the topic of female circumcision. For those who are fleeing female circumcision, or some other form of violence against women, these facts are not favourable. However, there are guarantees to which the Canadian government is bound which provide the basis for a positive finding of refugee status vis-&agrave;-vis these femaleclaimants.
<p>
The government of Canada has several objectives that it aims to fulfil with the <cite>Immigration Act</cite>. Two of these objectives are important for women. The first is &quot;to ensure that any person who seeks admission to Canada on either a permanent or temporary basis is subject to standards of admission that do not discriminate in a manner inconsistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty8">48</a></sup> The second is &quot;[t]o fulfil Canada's international legal obligations with respect to refugees and to uphold its humanitarian tradition with respect to the displaced and the persecuted.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty9">49</a></sup> In deciding cases, then, the Canadian Convention Refugee Determination Board cannot contravene the <cite>Charter</cite> or any
international treaty law that Canada has ratified. In this context, the s. 15(1) guarantee of the <cite>Charter</cite> is especially important in the case of a woman fleeing female circumcision: her equality rights must be respected. The different position of women vis-&agrave;-vis men in the refugee determination process must be recognized. Women's experiences must be analyzed for what they are and should not be examined solely on the basis of comparison with male experiences. A woman's right to life, liberty, and security of the person under s. 7 must also be considered when her case is being decided,
which may include different concerns from those in the case of a male claimant.<sup><a href="#fifty">50</a></sup>
<p>
Canada's obligations to women in international law are important to keep in mind when framing an argument. Canada has signed and ratified the <cite>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women</cite>, which states in art. 2 that parties shall condemn discrimination against women in all of its forms, and in art. 5(a) that 
<blockquote>
States Parties shall take all appropriate measures: (a) To modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women,  with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on
stereotyped roles for men and women.<sup><a href="#fifty1">51</a></sup>
</blockquote>
An obligation to protect women from female circumcision arises from this article, since much of the reasoning given for the practice is based on the idea of the inferiority of women, and on stereotyped roles for women and men. As a party to the <cite>Convention</cite>, Canada has therefore committed itself to ensuring that women's rights are considered during the refugee process. 
<p>
<h3>The New Guidelines for Refugee Determination</h3>

There are two criteria in the refugee definition that all claimants must satisfy. First, there must be a well-founded fear of persecution. Second, this fear must be based on membership in a particular group. In the case of female circumcision, a finding of refugee status would be dependent on the  haracterization/recognition of female circumcision as a form of gender-based persecution. The Minister of Employment and Immigration, Bernard Valcourt, announced on 29 January 1993 that female claimants may now qualify as refugees if they fear gender-based persecution. Previously, gender persecution had only been considered by the Immigration and Refugee Board if the persecution could also be characterized as persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. The new guidelines for refugee determination are intended to make it easier to determine whether women facing persecution based solely on gender are refugees.
<p>
The Minister made it clear in his statement, however, that the statutory definition of refugee will not be amended to include persecution based on gender as one of the articulated categories.<sup><a href="#fifty2">52</a></sup> Instead of changing the actual definition, the Immigration and Refugee Board has issued guidelines detailing how gender persecution is to be read into the existing statutory definition.<sup><a href="#fifty3">53</a></sup> The IRB has recognized that the category of &quot;membership in a particular social group&quot; is well-suited to reading in gender persecution because gender can be seen as an innate and immutable characteristic that is beyond a person's power to change.<sup><a href="#fifty4">54</a></sup> Decision makers are advised, however, to look first to other grounds, especially religion and political opinion, before looking to the more complex &quot;membership in a particular social group&quot; category.<sup><a href="#fifty5">55</a></sup> This approach is a more refined version of the present approach of the Board.
<p>
The changes that the new guidelines make in the determination process will be set out in the discussion of the grounds on which a woman can claim persecution. The most important result of the guidelines is that a woman can now claim that she fears gender-based persecution without concern that the IRB will declare that such persecution is outside of the statutory definition of refugee. It is much less clear, however, whether her persecution must also have some overt links to her religion, political beliefs, race, or nationality. If the Board takes the approach that these overt links are necessary, then a restrictive interpretation of the new guidelines, which appears to defeat the spirit of the proposed changes, will be the result. Such an approach should be guarded against by the Board, and can be if the guidelines are interpreted liberally. 
<p>
<h3>Arguments to Include Women in Social Groupings</h3>

It is most likely that if a woman fleeing female circumcision is to be considered part of any group, it would be a social group. Women are not likely to be publicly active in political, religious, racial, or nationalist organizations in those areas where female circumcision is prevalent. In the extremely patriarchal setting of communities that practise female circumcision, modest and quiet females are valued, and activism that
puts a woman in opposition to others may bring dishonour upon her family. Furthermore, in most Afro-Islamic communities, women have a very narrowly defined role: their focus is their family. In all likelihood, a woman fleeing circumcision will fit only within the social group category.
<p>
How is a social group defined? The United Nations High Commission of Refugees <cite>Handbook</cite> defines a particular social group as a group that comprises &quot;persons of similar background, habits, or social status.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty6">56</a></sup> This has been defined by case law to include associations of a voluntary nature.<sup><a href="#fifty7">57</a></sup> Goodwin-Gill believes that there
are further factors that are important to the determination whether a person belongs to a particular social group:
<blockquote>
[It is important to identify] unifying factors such as ethnic, cultural, and linguistic origin; education; family background; economic activity; shared values, outlook and aspirations. Also relevant are the attitude to the putative social group of other groups in the same society and, in particular, the treatment accorded
to it by state authorities.<sup><a href="#fifty8">58</a></sup>
</blockquote>
There have been recent Canadian cases defining &quot;social group,&quot; although the resulting definitions are often not very useful in trying to categorize women who do not also have a racial, religious or political connection for their persecution. <cite>Attorney General of Canada v. Ward</cite> defines &quot;social group&quot; narrowly as a group of people associated with one another in some way that is perceived as a possible danger to the government.<sup><a href="#fifty9">59</a></sup> <cite>Astudillo</cite> mentions the immediate family as a social grouping.<sup><a href="#sixty">60</a></sup> In this vein, an argument can be made that a woman fleeing female circumcision is fleeing persecution arising from her membership in a close-knit extended family. The IRB explicitly recognizes that the pressures on that family and within that family to continue the tradition of circumcision may leave the woman with no choice but to flee. The new guidelines note that the strong
jurisprudential authority for allowing claims of familial affiliation may provide the most obvious grounds for a woman claiming persecution.<sup><a href="#sixty1">61</a></sup> In the case of a woman fleeing female circumcision, the Board would almost certainly recognize the pressure that kinship presents for a woman. 
<p>
In <cite>Minister of Employment and Immigration v. Marcel Meyers</cite>,<sup><a href="#sixty2">62</a></sup> Mahoney J.A. concludes that it is not an error in law to conclude that the Refugee Division might find &quot;Trinidadian women subject to wife abuse&quot; to be a particular social
group.<sup><a href="#sixty3">63</a></sup> This particular social grouping is characteristic of the approach of the Board to women's claims insofar as the Board appears to prefer to name a fairly narrow category in which the claimant falls. The Board approaches cases in which claims are specifically gender-related in a similar manner. First, the Board recognizes the obvious unifying factor of gender, as it has been set out in international practice. In the <cite>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women</cite>, women's specific human rights have been deemed to differ from men's, especially because of the role that pregnancy and the nurturance of children play in women's lives, and because of the specific work women do in the non-monetized sectors of society.<sup><a href="#sixty4">64</a></sup> Women have also been considered as a distinctive group in other international human rights documents, such as the <cite>Convention on the Political Rights of Women</cite> (1953), the <cite>Convention on the Nationality of Married Women (1957), the Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage, and the Registration of Marriages</cite> (1962), and the <cite> Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women</cite> (1967).<sup><a href="#sixty5">65</a></sup> There are other international arenas where women have been seen as belonging to a distinct social grouping. In 1984, the European Parliament adopted a resolution encouraging states to recognize as refugees women who faced persecution because they had transgressed the social mores of their communities.<sup><a href="#sixty6">66</a></sup> The delegates to the 1985 Soesterburg Conference on refugee women adopted a comparable resolution.<sup><a href="#sixty7">67</a></sup> As noted earlier, the Executive
Committee of the UNHCR has suggested that states adopt an interpretation of social group that would include as asylum seekers women who had offended the social mores of their society. A similar interpretation has been adopted in the <cite>Criteria for Determining &quot;Convention Refugee&quot; Status</cite>, the guidelines of the UNHCR Legal Project in Canada.<sup><a href="#sixty8">68</a></sup>
<p>
Second, the Board delineates the oppression faced by the claimant and others in her position. In <cite>Meyers</cite>, the oppression that the claimant suffered was spousal abuse. <cite>Meyers</cite> also sets out a third identifier: that of culture or race in this case. In making an argument based on the new criteria for determining refugee status, one should recognize the preference of the Board in the past that a woman's position be clarified by description as much as possible. For example, a Board would be more open to the classification of Animata Diop as an African, or a Malian, woman fearing female circumcision rather than as a woman fearing gender-based persecution. By creating a clear, particularized category for the claimant, it is easier for the Board to determine where a woman falls within the proposed framework of the new guidelines. The categorization allows the Board to evaluate in a focused manner how many women would fall within the category and how serious their claims are.<sup><a href="#sixty9">69</a></sup>
<p>
In terms of domestic Canadian case law, it is important to realize that Canadian courts have accepted that women can be recognized as a social group, even without the sort of particularization that the Board prefers. The Supreme Court of Canada has recognized in <cite>R. v. Lavallee</cite> that women's size, strength, socialization, and training in self-defence are usually different from men's in ways that work to women's
disadvantage.<sup><a href="#seventy">70</a></sup> Wilson J.'s decision in <cite>R. v. Morgentaler</cite> supports the argument that women share certain immutable characteristics that are not shared with men, such as the ability to become pregnant. This ability to become pregnant creates fundamentally different choices for women from those for men.<sup><a href="#seventy1">71</a></sup> Women are an easily identifiable group in Canada because of their ability to bear children, their overwhelming presence in low-income employment, their typical pay differential with men, the sexual harassment they encounter, and the treatment they receive as children and adolescents.<sup><a href="#seventy2">72</a></sup> Stairs and Pope state: &quot;This combination of biological and socially
attributed characteristics make women a social group within the meaning of the Convention definition.&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy3">73</a></sup>
<p>
There are problems, however, that one may face when arguing that a female claimant falls within a social group defined solely by gender. First and foremost, the group &quot;women&quot; may be seen as too large and indistinct. The draft guidelines hint at this by stressing that the group to be considered under the refugee definition is not solely women, but rather women who have suffered from a serious form of harm that detracts from their human rights and fundamental freedoms.<sup><a href="#seventy4">74</a></sup> This
definition might exclude women who suffer from anything less than sexual violence or other sexual indignities. Despite this qualification on the ability of women to claim refugee status, some decision makers may still be concerned that a social group defined by gender allows too many women to qualify for refugee status under this heading.
<p>
The &quot;floodgates&quot; argument is understandable, but not valid. The argument ignores the fact that there are two phases to the refugee determination process: proving that a claimant is situated in a social group, <i>and</i> proving that she has been persecuted or fears persecution because of that situation. For example, under the new guidelines, a women cannot claim refugee status based solely on the fact that she is subject to a national policy to which she objects if she is not persecuted on the basis of the policy.<sup><a href="#seventy5">75</a></sup> Castel states that &quot;there is nothing in the Convention definition of refugee which would exclude a claimant from its application solely on the basis that the persecution feared was also directed to a large number of members of a group to which the claimant belonged.&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy6">76</a></sup> Castel also refers to guidelines 9 and 10 of the former Canadian
Refugee Status Advisory Committee, which state:
<blockquote>
A person is a refugee whether he is persecuted alone, or persecuted with others. A person need not be singled out for persecution in order to be a refugee. Each claim must be assessed individually. Once that large number of them could also legitimately fear the same persecution.<sup><a href="#seventy7">77</a></sup>
<p>
It is recognized that immigration considerations must not be brought to bear on the application of the refugee definition. The possibility that, if one person is given refugee status, many others might also be entitled to claim refugee status, is not relevant to whether a claimant is a refugee.<sup><a href="#seventy8">78</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Even if there are very large numbers of women persecuted because of gender, this fact is not enough to disqualify the women as claimants. What is relevant is that the woman's situation can be distinguished from the situation of the general population.<sup><a href="#seventy9">79</a></sup> Each case must be evaluated on an individual basis.
<p>
It is not clear that the new guidelines allow for as broad a definition of women as a social group as some may expect. However, even if the Board finds that the classification of &quot;women&quot; as a social group is too broad, a social group of &quot;women plus another defining characteristic&quot; would still help the women who need refugee status. In the case of women fleeing circumcision, their situation may or may not provide the necessary defining characteristic. They may also need to fit a geographic, cultural, racial, national, or religious category in common with other women in similar positions. There are two problems, however, with the narrow approach of &quot;gender plus another defining characteristic&quot; that may affect women claiming refugee status because of any gender-based persecution. The narrow approach is problematic because in defining the group as &quot;women,&quot; not all forms of gender persecution may be addressed.<sup><a href="#eighty">80</a></sup> The second problem with arguing that &quot;women fleeing circumcision&quot; is an appropriate subcategory is that the existing case law does not provide any sort of precedent for accepting two identifying factors as sufficient. The present case law contains definitions of &quot;social group&quot; that have three or more identifying factors. For example, in <cite>W(Y.L.) (Re)</cite>, it was held that &quot;Tamil women in the area of [Sri Lankan] IPKF operations without an adult male protector resident with them form a unity on account of their gender, geographic location and living conditions. They therefore form a group.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty1">81</a></sup> In this case, it appears that geographic location and living conditions are extra factors needed to qualify women as a social group. The tribunal also commented in this case that women were generally segregated socially from men in the claimant's village.<sup><a href="#eighty2">82</a></sup> This factor defined the gender difference. In <cite>Incircyan v. Minister of Employment and Immigration</cite>,<sup><a href="#eighty3">83</a></sup> the Board accepted that a
social group could consist of &quot;single women living in a Moslem country without the protection of a male relative.&quot;  Similarly, &quot;young Tamil women&quot; have been recognized as belonging to a social group.<sup><a href="#eighty4">84</a></sup> In all of these definitions there are more than two defining factors that narrow the grouping.
<p>
In the United States, the Immigration Appeal Board has rejected the floodgates argument and adopted the approach that the definition of social group &quot;must be given a broad and liberal interpretation in order to protect groups or individuals who do not necessarily have political, religious, or racial ties at the root of their persecution.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty5">85</a></sup> In Canada, under the <cite>Interpretation
Act</cite>,<sup><a href="#eighty6">86</a></sup> every enactment, including the <cite>Immigration Act</cite>, must be given such &quot;fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as best insures the attainment of its objects.&quot;  Therefore, it can be argued that the Canadian position on the interpretation of &quot;social group&quot; should be similar to the American approach. Edward Broadbent
describes the dynamics of the numbers of women that would actually come to Canada under the new guidelines, even if they are broadly interpreted:
<blockquote>
Voices will clamour that we cannot open the door ... because that would open the floodgates and they would never close. This argument is not only wrong in principle, but it ignores social and political reality. Women around the world are fighting to improve their situation, and the solutions to their problems lie
within their own societies, not in asylum in Canada. Women know this. Their principal struggles are and will remain at home, as will the overwhelming majority of women themselves.<sup><a href="#eighty7">87</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Thus, a fair, large, and liberal interpretation of &quot;gender&quot; as a social group will not attract vast numbers of women. Genevi&egrave;ve Camus-Jacques also believes that the floodgates fear would never be realized because social constraints on women in their country of origin are such that relatively few persecuted women ever manage to flee to other countries for protection.<sup><a href="#eighty8">88</a></sup>
<p>
The complexity involved in defining social groups is the reason for the recommendation in the draft guidelines that the Board look to religious or political factors before social group factors. In the case of women fleeing female circumcision, perhaps the extra defining factors the Board seems to require could be found under the political or religious categories.
<p>
<h3>Arguments to Include Women in Political Groupings</h3>

A woman fleeing female circumcision may face persecution because of her political opinion. This is made clear in the new guidelines.<sup><a href="#eighty9">89</a></sup> Canadian case law has determined that the definition of political is determined by the country of origin, not by Canada: &quot;[T]he crucial test is not whether the Board considers the applicant engaged in political activities, but whether the ruling government of the country from which he claims to be a refugee, considers his conduct to be political activity.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety">90</a></sup> This test could be difficult to meet unless an
interpretation of political opinion relating to women was adopted in Canada that is similar to that in American case law. In the case of <cite>Lazo-Majano v. Immigration and Naturalization Service</cite>,<sup><a href="#ninety1">91</a></sup> the Court held that the rape of a woman by an off-duty soldier could still fall under the category of political persecution:
<blockquote>
[I]f the situation is seen in its social context, Zuniga [the soldier] is asserting the political opinion that a man has a right to dominate and he has persecuted Olympia [the petitioner] through force to accept this opinion without rebellion. Zuniga told Olympia that in his treatment of her he was seeking revenge. But Olympia knew of no injury she had ever done Zuniga. His statement reflects a much more generalized animosity to the opposite sex, an assertion of a political aspiration and the desire to suppress opposition to it. Olympia was not permitted by Zuniga to hold an opinion to the contrary. When by flight, she asserted one, she became exposed to persecution for her assertion. Persecution threatened her because of her political opinion.<sup><a href="#ninety2">92</a></sup>
</blockquote>
As Stairs and Pope note, what appears to be non-political activity by women may, on more careful inspection, turn out to be a form of political protest or organization.<sup><a href="#ninety3">93</a></sup> It is important to ascertain whether a woman fleeing circumcision belongs to any anti-circumcision groups, or has expressed the opinion that she supports such groups. The fact that she had expressed opposition to the procedure and then was threatened with it could indicate that her opinion was viewed as political. Even if she had not expressed opposition to the practice publicly, the act of refusal could be characterized as political in a society where the vast majority of men and women support the procedure. This is analogous to the refusal of some Iranian women to wear a veil as an expression of opposition to the Islamic fundamentalist state.<sup><a href="#ninety4">94</a></sup>
 <p>
If women refuse to follow a community's social mores, they may be considered feminist, and therefore political. However, feminist activity has not in the past been widely perceived as political activity.<sup><a href="#ninety5">95</a></sup> The new guidelines note that where such a minute contravention as the wearing of make-up arouses political fear in certain regimes, it may be almost impossible for women to go
further and develop more recognizable indicia of political opinion.<sup><a href="#ninety6">96</a></sup> The fact that a tribunal or court may not find itself able to make an analogy between opposition to female circumcision and more traditional forms of political opposition because of the difficulty of comparing male and female political experience has been remedied by the draft guidelines. The political nature of the oppression of women in the context of religious laws and ritualization should be recognized by the Board,<sup><a href="#ninety7">97</a></sup> along with the strong ritual and religious connections attached to female circumcision.
<p>
<h3>Persecution</h3>

A woman who claims <cite>Geneva Convention</cite> refugee status must not only place herself within one of the enumerated groups in the definition of refugee, but must also prove that female circumcision is a form of persecution and that the fear of circumcision is well founded. How is persecution defined?  The term is not defined in the <cite>Geneva Convention</cite>, nor is it defined in the <cite>Immigration Act</cite>. The <cite>UNHCR Handbook</cite> notes that
<blockquote>
[f]rom Article 33 of the Convention, it may be inferred that a threat to life or freedom on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group is always persecution. Other serious violations of human rights---for the same reasons---would also constitute persecution.<sup><a href="#ninety8">98</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The Immigration and Refugee Board has stated that a &quot;serious threat to the claimant's `right to life, liberty and security of the person' amounts to persecution.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety9">99</a></sup>
The Court in <cite>Rajudeen v. Minister of Employment and Immigration</cite> defined &quot;persecute&quot; by reference to dictionary definitions: &quot;To harass or afflict with repeated acts of cruelty or annoyance; to afflict persistently, to afflict or punish because of particular opinions or adherence to a particular creed or mode of worship.&quot;<sup><a href="#onehundred">100</a></sup> In <cite>Araya Heredio v. Minister of Employment and Immigration</cite>, the Immigration Appeal Board held that &quot;[a]ny repeated or sustained attack on not only a person's physical integrity, but also his moral integrity, constitutes persecution.&quot;<sup><a href="#one01">101</a></sup> The new guidelines note that these definitions were formed on the basis of male experiences, but that they could be applied to the case of circumcision.<sup><a href="#one02">102</a></sup>
<p>
Female circumcision must satisfy a fairly high standard to be considered as persecution. The <cite>Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</cite> states in  art. 3(1) that &quot;[n]o State party shall expel, return (`<i>refouler</i>') or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial  grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.&quot;<sup><a href="#one03">103</a></sup> This definition can be applied to refugee situations.<sup><a href="#one04">104</a></sup> At a minimum, the meaning of &quot;persecution&quot; includes the definition of torture in the <cite>Convention Against Torture</cite>:<sup><a href="#one05">105</a></sup> 
<blockquote>
any act by which severe pain and suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as ... intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind ... with the consent or acquiescence of a public official.<sup><a href="#one06">106</a></sup>
</blockquote>
It can be argued quite persuasively that female circumcision is an act that is analogous to the definition of
torture: it causes both severe pain and mental and physical suffering, it is intentionally inflicted, and it is a manifestation of gender discrimination. As observed by the Court in the <cite>Aminata Diop</cite> case, public officials in the claimant's country may ignore the practice. This may be construed as the kind of &quot;consent or acquiescence&quot; referred to in the <cite>Convention Against Torture</cite>. If the
female victims are old enough, it is common for them to manifest severe anxiety and a generalized phobic reaction to being touched, of knives, of social gatherings, or of going to sleep before the circumcision is performed.<sup><a href="#one07">107</a></sup> Furthermore, the memory of friends and sisters who died or who suffered greatly because of the operation weigh heavily on the woman facing circumcision. Aminata Diop herself described her friend's death to the Court when trying to explain this anxiety.<sup><a href="#one08">108</a></sup> This satisfies the mental suffering requirement of the torture definition. 
<p>
This anxiety is well founded. Only rarely is the procedure done by a doctor in sanitary conditions. Usually, a midwife or a grandmother performs the circumcision, with the female being held down by many other women. The procedure is usually done without any anaesthetic, and is often done with an unsanitized sharp instrument such as a stone, kitchen knife, old razor blade, or broken glass.<sup><a href="#one09">109</a></sup> Animal dung and mud are often used to patch the wound in an attempt to stop the bleeding.<sup><a href="#one10">110</a></sup> The female is then immobilized for 15 to 40 days to let the wound heal enough. There are immediate and short-term complications. Slack describes these:
<blockquote>
The unsterilized instruments and unhygienic methods used in the various procedures, especially infibulation, can result in immediate medical problems: hemorrhage, septicemia, shock from pain and blood loss, acute infection (such as tetanus from unclean utensils and the materials used to patch the wounds), urine retention
due to occlusion, damage to and bleeding from adjacent organs and tissue (including rectum and urethra), and even death.<sup><a href="#one11">111</a></sup>
</blockquote>
In the Sudan, where antibiotics are not available, about one-third of all females die as a result of  circumcision.<sup><a href="#one12">112</a></sup> Long-term complications range from frequent urinary tract infections and blockages to severe menstrual problems to an increased likelihood of death during childbirth. Furthermore, the scarring that results can adversely affect how a woman walks<sup><a href="#one13">113</a></sup> and moves, and the method of circumcision can lead to an increased susceptibility to AIDS.<sup><a href="#one14">114</a></sup> Hosken and UNESCO both note that
these problems that stem from circumcision create deep psychological wounds that may be manifested in chronic irritability, anxiety, depressive episodes, psychosis, and fear of sexual intercourse.<sup><a href="#one15">115</a></sup> Torture and female circumcision have much in common. 
<p>
Other aids that courts might consider in defining persecution are the definitions of personal integrity found in Canadian case law. In <cite>R. v. McCraw</cite>, the Supreme Court of Canada held that &quot;[f]or women rape under any circumstance must constitute a profound interference with their physical integrity. As well, by force or threat of force, it denies women the right to exercise freedom of choice as to their partner for sexual relations and the timing of those relations. These are choices of great importance that may have
a substantial effect upon the life and health of every woman.&quot;<sup><a href="#one16">116</a></sup> Female circumcision has similar effects on its victims: a circumcised woman has experienced a profound interference with her physical integrity. A woman is often denied any choice in whether she is to be circumcised or not, and in what form.
<p>
A final consideration that may assist the Convention Refugee Determination Division in deciding whether the threat or practice of female circumcision is persecution is how female circumcision is viewed in Canada. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario has recently banned doctors from performing female  circumcision.<sup><a href="#one17">117</a></sup> The College has also called on the federal government specifically to outlaw the procedure, as several other countries, including the United Kingdom, have done.<sup><a href="#one18">118</a></sup> The government has stated that the act of female circumcision in Canada is to be viewed as an offence under  the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>.<sup><a href="#one19">119</a></sup> In January 1992, Muslim leaders in Ottawa stated that the Koran does not advocate female circumcision.<sup><a href="#one20">120</a></sup> The Ontario Association of Children's Aid Societies considers the circumcision of girls to be child abuse.<sup><a href="#one21">121</a></sup> Clearly, in the Canadian context female circumcision is condemned as criminal and discriminatory.
<p>
<h3>State Connection</h3>

Explicit in the definition of a <cite>Geneva Convention</cite> refugee is the need for a state connection. The definition states that a claimant must be unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of his or her country. In <cite>Rajudeen</cite>, it was held to be reasonable that the claimant would not go to the authorities since they were part of the majority group that was persecuting him.<sup><a href="#one22">122</a></sup> It was held that there is a state connection if the state refuses or is unable to protect the claimant from persecutory behaviour.<sup><a href="#one23">123</a></sup> In <cite>Surujpal v. Minister of Employment and Immigration</cite>, MacGuigan J.A. implied that both unwillingness and inability to act are forms of state complicity.<sup><a href="#one24">124</a></sup> In <cite>Ward</cite>, Urie J. held that a claimant who is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of his country of origin implicitly believes that the state and its authorities cannot protect him from those he fears will persecute him.<sup><a href="#one25">125</a></sup> This would usually be the case in those countries where the authorities turn a blind eye to the practice of female circumcision. However, the narrow definition of being &quot;unable&quot; to avail oneself of the protection of the state given in <cite>Ward</cite> as meaning &quot;physically unable&quot;<sup><a href="#one26">126</a></sup> does not assist those who fear circumcision, unless being physically unable is equivalent to being unable to seek protection from state authorities because there are no authorities in the vicinity, as in rural areas, or where the claimant has no means of transportation to the authorities. In <cite>Zalzali v. Minister of Employment and Immigration</cite>, &quot;unable&quot; was held to include situations in which there is no government to appeal to.<sup><a href="#one27">127</a></sup> This may apply in cases of women fleeing circumcision in Somalia.
<p>
The explanation of persecution in the UNHCR Handbook is similar to the Canadian case law:
<blockquote>
Where serious discriminatory or other offensive acts are committed by the local populace, they can be considered as persecution if they are knowingly tolerated by the authorities, or if the authorities refuse, or prove unable, to offer effective protection.<sup><a href="#one28">128</a></sup>
</blockquote>
It is hard to imagine a situation in which the threat of, or the performance of, female circumcision will ever be directly attributable to the state. The most likely scenario is one in which a woman is pressured by her family or community to undergo the procedure, and the state does not provide any adequate legal recourse
to protect against these pressures, or to punish the perpetrators after the fact. There are laws in many countries where female circumcision is practised that ban either the whole procedure or the most extreme procedure, infibulation. It is not enough, however, for states merely to pass laws. 
<p>
In 1974 Sudan passed a law forbidding Pharaonic circumcision. However, the Sudanese laws against infibulation have not been obeyed because &quot;the custom is still an integral, positive-functioning component of the familial complex, and so, indirectly of the entire socio-cultural system.&quot;<sup><a href="#one29">129</a></sup> Sudan's 10 million circumcised women are therefore left without effective enforcement or protection. Similarly, in 1959 the Egyptian Minister of Health recommended that the more extreme procedures performed by midwives be replaced by partial clitoridectomy performed by doctors.<sup><a href="#one30">130</a></sup> A further resolution in 1978 forbade midwives to perform the operations.<sup><a href="#one31">131</a></sup> These laws, however, have had no effect on the amount of circumcision still performed, except to make the performance of the procedure more secretive. The Central African Republic has had legislation banning female circumcision since 1960,<sup>,a href="#one32">132</a></sup> but as of 1992, 50 percent of all women in that country were circumcised.<sup><a href="#one33">133</a></sup> The situation is similar in Guinea: despite the existence of legislation against female circumcision for the last 20 years,<sup><a href="#one34">134</a></sup> 60 percent of all women in that country are circumcised.<sup><a href="#one35">135</a></sup> Tanzania has legislation against female circumcision at the local level, and the heads of state of Benin, Burkino Faso, Kenya, and Senegal have pronounced themselves to be against the practice of female circumcision.<sup><a href="#one36">136</a></sup> However, these positive developments have not actually reduced the numbers of women and girls undergoing circumcision, a fact that indicates the strength of tradition and social pressure and the ineffectiveness of legal sanctions. When female circumcision is supported by the majority of a community's population, it is unlikely that the authorities will be willing or able to enforce any prohibitive legislation. 
<p>
There are many reasons why a lone complainant will not or cannot seek the assistance of the authorities. A victim is sure to face ostracism in her community if she seeks the help of a doctor after a badly managed circumcision and reveals to him or her the name of the midwife, as is required by law in many countries.<sup><a href="#one37">137</a></sup> The law can only be effective if both parents are opposed to circumcision. The head of the family (usually the father of the victim) can threaten the grandmothers (who usually organize the circumcision) with police action should his daughter be circumcised. This has been effective in some cases.<sup><a href="#one38">138</a></sup> If, however, the head of the family supports the circumcision, it is highly unlikely that a young female will oppose her family and community and go to the authorities.
<p>
In many cultures in which circumcision takes place, women are not allowed to venture out of the private domain without a male chaperone, and a woman's evidence may be considered to be worth less than a man's. She would have to get someone to substantiate her claim, probably another woman (since women handle the circumcisions), and in a tight-knit community where a woman's honour is tied to her respect for community mores, this is unlikely. Dareer notes that an additional problem occurs in countries that are not culturally
accustomed to punishing women through the law.<sup><a href="#one39">139</a></sup> Since most of
those who perform and arrange circumcisions are women, countries without a history of charging or trying women are less likely than countries with such a history to have in place methods for the punishment of females that the general public will accept. Consequently, the authorities will be less likely to pursue a
complaint about circumcision. There is a very strong taboo against speaking about female circumcision in most communities that practise the procedure.<sup><a href="#one40">140</a></sup> This also deters women from going to the authorities. All of these factors make it unlikely that a woman could look to the law as a source of protection from circumcision and support an argument that a woman could not avail herself of the protection of her state.
<p>
<h3>Evidentiary Problems</h3>

In assessing a woman's claim of gender-based persecution, the evidence must show that what the claimant genuinely fears is persecution as distinguished from random violence or ordinary crime perpetrated against her as an individual.<sup><a href="#one41">141</a></sup> There may be several evidentiary problems
faced by someone trying to establish that circumcision is a form of persecution. These problems can also apply to other cases of violence against women. First, the claimant may consider it embarrassing or dishonourable to discuss the topic of female circumcision, especially in a public forum such as a Board
hearing.<sup><a href="#one42">142</a></sup> She may, therefore, not want to discuss the particular details of her experience. Second, there is a lack of knowledge within Canadian society generally about the topic of female circumcision, and this means that counsel will have to explain the claimant's situation
carefully. If a woman is fleeing circumcision and has not undergone the procedure, there is probably little physical evidence for her case. In Aminata Diop's case, she was beaten by her father for refusing to be circumcised, so she might have had medical proof of the beating. There may be problems encountered with any evidence that can support the word of the claimant: in Aminata Diop's case, her illiterate mother's dictated letter was considered inadmissible as hearsay evidence. All of these factors must be taken into account in making submissions. Stairs and Pope warn that more extensive submissions than usual will be required for such an unusual claim.<sup><a href="#one43">143</a></sup> 
<p>
There may be resistance to viewing the threat or practice of female circumcision as persecution. Some decision makers may feel that to call circumcision &quot;persecution&quot; is insensitive to the religious and cultural beliefs of the claimant's community. This cultural relativism argument is misleading<sup><a href="#one44">144</a></sup> because it values the practices of the community the claimant is fleeing differently from her right to the integrity of her body and total development. These are rights recognized by Canada in the <cite>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite>, the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>, and in Canada's international legal commitments to women. Cultural sensitivity is important, but it must not be used as an excuse for not exploring a gender-based refugee claim. Furthermore, it may be difficult to establish the general human rights record of the claimant's country of origin and the experiences of other similarly situated women, as required in the new guidelines.<sup><a href="#one45">145</a></sup> The new guidelines recognize these evidentiary problems, and direct the decision makers to evaluate the whole of the complainant's evidence with these difficulties in mind.<sup><a href="#one46">146</a></sup>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

The articulation of new guidelines for refugee determination in Canada is a positive step in determining &quot;the appropriate responses to the complex and inter-related issues of state-sanctioned abuse abroad, conjugal violence against women, and assistance to female refugees in times of world crises.&quot;<sup><a href="#one47">147</a></sup> Although the new policy that adds &quot;gender&quot; persecution to the definition of &quot;refugee&quot; appears to eliminate the need to determine whether women fall under a social or political grouping, it is very likely that the Immigration and Refugee Board will require that women must be linked not only to the gender category but also to another grouping. The political and social grouping tests will be important to demonstrate that a woman fleeing circumcision can fall under more than one part of the definition, thereby creating the web of connections that the Board has favoured in the past. It appears that &quot;state connection&quot; will play a very important role in determining whether a woman has suffered gender-based persecution. One must keep in mind that it is not enough that a woman fall into the category of being persecuted because of &quot;gender&quot;; she must also prove some sort of acquiescence or consent on the part of the state. The Board will interpret these new guidelines as they see fit; since these guidelines cannot be binding on the Board, the Board has the independence to determine exactly how the new guidelines will be used.<sup><a href="#one48">148</a></sup> The hope is that the Board will not expect a level of proof that is unrealistic so as to exclude those cases in which there are laws in place that prohibit female circumcision but societal pressures are such that the laws are not obeyed. 
<p>
It is likely that a case similar to Aminata Diop's, that of a woman fleeing circumcision, will arise in Canada in the near future. This article has attempted to outline the problems one would face in arguing such a case. With the issuing of the new guidelines, gender-related persecution is recognized as a ground for claiming refugee status. Thus, the task of convincing the tribunals and courts that female circumcision is a form of persecution is made easier. However, such a finding will never be automatic. First, the tribunal must decide that female circumcision is gender-related persecution. The fact that the practice is done to women satisfies the gender relation, but the persecution argument may have to be more fully developed if the type of circumcision faced by the claimant was of a less mutilating type or if all of the factors set out in the
<cite>Convention Against Torture</cite> definition are not evident. There will almost certainly be questions from a tribunal as to proof that the claimant had a well-founded fear of circumcision while in her country. The state connection is the hardest argument to make since, if there are laws prohibiting female circumcision in the claimant's state, she must prove that the protection they provide is effectively non-existent. Undoubtedly, there will be inquiries into other potential motivations for leaving the home country.
<p>
The new guidelines provide a better chance for success in cases similar to Aminata Diop's.<sup><a href="#one49">149</a></sup> However, the fact that the definition of refugee has not been amended to include gender as one of the enumerated grounds means that the strongest protection for women facing gender persecution has been denied by Canada. Since the new guidelines only recommend where gender-based concerns can be read in, there is still the danger that the Immigration and Refugee Board will ultimately define the grounds for claims by women narrowly. This may be done in response to the fear that too many women would qualify as refugees otherwise. A narrow reading of the new guidelines would defeat their purpose, and would make it uncertain who will qualify, thereby creating the confusion that the new guidelines were meant to avoid. Canada has the appropriate policies and case-law in place for a woman
fleeing female circumcision to claim refugee status. The test is now whether Canada will set an international precedent by following the letter and spirit of the new guidelines, and admitting women who fear female circumcision as refugees.

<li><a name="one">In this article</a> the term &quot;female circumcision&quot; will be used. Some authors consider this an incorrect term since it implies, falsely, an equivalency with male circumcision. However, the term &quot;genital mutilation&quot; is also controversial, since it is seen as entirely
negative and insensitive to circumcised women.

She cites A. el Dareer, <cite>Woman, Why Do You Weep?</cite> (London: Zed Press, 1982) at 1: out of a total sample of 3,210 women, 3,171 (98.8  percent) were circumcised, and only 39 (1.2  percent) were uncircumcised.

Lightfoot-Klein describes this: in southern and western Sudan &quot;Arabization&quot; is spreading, and with it circumcision. Unfortunately, female circumcision is construed as a &quot;modern and hygienic&quot; and &quot;educated&quot; practice, and so excision is taken to extremes, referred to as &quot;scraping the girls clean.&quot;  A similar situation occurs in Uganda, where former exiled militants wish to preserve endangered African customs (not necessarily Ugandan in origin), and so practice the most extreme form of genital mutilation.

He told her that if she ever informed on him he would denounce her as a subversive and she would be tortured and killed.

<h1><cite>Keegstra, Butler</cite>, and Positive Liberty: A Glimmer of Hope for the Faithful
<p> 
VICTOR V. RAMRAJ</h1>
<p><br>
<center><h3>ABSTRACT</h3></center>

Through an examination of two recent decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada on the freedom of expression guarantee in the <cite>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, R. v. Keegstra</cite> and <cite>R. v. Butler</cite>, the author argues for a unitary vision of the <cite>Charter</cite> grounded on the concept of positive liberty. Positive liberty, understood as the ability of individuals to be their own masters and to participate in society
with equal dignity and respect, is to be contrasted with negative liberty, or the absence of external impediments, which informed the dissent in <cite>Keegstra</cite>. Legislation that impairs the negative liberty of one individual still may be consistent with the goal of enhancing the positive liberty and, correspondingly, the political equality of other members of society. Moreover, as implied in <cite>Butler</cite>, to the extent that positive liberty is a fundamental political value in a free and democratic society, the courts are bound to uphold it under the <cite>Charter</cite>. By recognizing the importance of legislation designed to enhance respectively the political equality of ethnic minorities and women, the majority decisions in <cite>Keegstra</cite> and <cite>Butler</cite> represent a return to this earlier vision of the <cite>Charter</cite> in which the two stages of analysis---the establishment of an infringement by the rights-claimant and the attempted justification of the infringement
by the state---are unified under the concept of positive liberty.
<p>
Par une analyse de deux arr&ecirc;ts r&eacute;cents de la Cour supr&ecirc;me du Canada portant sur la libert&eacute; d'expression garantie dans la <cite>Charte canadienne des droits et libert&eacute;s</cite>, &agrave; savoir <cite>R. c. Keegstra</cite> et <cite>R. c. Butler</cite>, l'auteur pr&eacute;conise une vision unifi&eacute;e de la <cite>Charte</cite> fond&eacute;e sur le concept de libert&eacute; positive. La libert&eacute; positive, qui signifie la capacit&eacute; des individus d'&ecirc;tre ma&icirc;tre de soi et de prendre part &agrave; la soci&eacute;t&eacute; avec dignit&eacute; et respect &eacute;gaux, s'oppose au principe de la libert&eacute;
n&eacute;gative, ou l'absence de contraintes externes, qui est &agrave; la base de l'opinion dissidente dans <cite>Keegstra</cite>. Une loi qui porte atteinte &agrave; la libert&eacute; n&eacute;gative d'un individu peut n&eacute;anmoins &ecirc;tre compatible avec l'am&eacute;lioration de la libert&eacute; positive et, en cons&eacute;quence, avec la promotion de l'&eacute;galit&eacute; politique d'autres membres de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;. En plus, il est  sous-entendu dans <cite>Butler</cite> que dans la mesure o&ugrave; la
libert&eacute; positive est une valeur politique fondamentale dans le cadre d'une soci&eacute;t&eacute; libre et d&eacute;mocratique, la <cite>Charte</cite> oblige les tribunaux &agrave; la soutenir. En reconnaissant l'importance des lois favorisant l'&eacute;galit&eacute; politique respective des minorit&eacute;s ethniques et des femmes, les opinions majoritaires dans <cite>Keegstra</cite> et <cite>Butler</cite> adoptent &agrave; nouveau la vision de la <cite>Charte</cite> selon laquelle les deux &eacute;tapes analytiques, &agrave; savoir la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; pour le revendicateur d'&eacute;tablir une atteinte &agrave; ses droits et la mise en avant de justifications par l'&Eacute;tat, se r&eacute;unissent dans la notion de libert&eacute; positive.

<h1>Worlds Apart on Words Apart: Re-examining the Doctrine of Shifting Purpose in Statutory Interpretation
<p> 
SCOTT G. REQUADT</h1>
<p><br>
<center><h3>ABSTRACT</h3></center>

Statutes that are obsolete or out of phase with contemporary social context present a unique interpretative problem
to courts. On one hand, courts can adhere strictly to the tenet of originalism in statutory interpretation by seeking to discern, and follow, the legislature's intent at the time that the particular statute was enacted. On the other hand, courts may turn to the non-originalist school of statutory interpretation, which would have them look to, and seek to further, the &quot;values&quot; implicit in a particular statute. The doctrine of shifting purpose is a non-originalist approach to statutory interpretation which recognizes that a statute's purpose may shift or be transformed over time by changing social conditions. Although this doctrine has been formally rejected by the Supreme Court of Canada, this paper argues that the approach has since manifested itself in other forms, and by other names, in subsequent case law. The reasons and assumptions upon which the court originally rejected this doctrine are set out and
critically examined under the lens of selective contemporary legal and hermeneutic theory. It is asserted that interpretation, even within an originalist framework, is an inherently subjective exercise which betrays much of the objectivity and certainty which the court attributed to it in its rejection of the shifting purpose doctrine. This article, therefore, urges a re-examination of the shifting purpose doctrine for statutes which are obsolete or out of phase. Such a conclusion is consistent with the tendency in other fields to dispute the traditional dichotomy between legislative and adjudicative roles, and permits courts to assume the more dynamic role demanded by situations involving significantly changed social circumstances.
<p>
L'interpr&eacute;tation des lois qui sont d&eacute;su&egrave;tes ou d&eacute;phas&eacute;es par rapport &agrave; leur contexte social pose un probl&egrave;me particulier pour les tribunaux. D'une part, les tribunaux peuvent maintenir le principe de volont&eacute; originale en essayant de d&eacute;terminer quelle &eacute;tait l'intention des l&eacute;gislateurs au moment de l'adoption de la loi et de respecter celle-ci. D'autre part, les tribunaux peuvent se servir de th&eacute;ories visant &agrave; avancer les &lt;&lt;valeurs&gt;&gt; qui sont sous-entendues dans la loi. La doctrine de l'objet variable est une approche non-originaliste qui reconna&icirc;t que l'objet d'une loi peut changer ou se transformer au fil du temps &agrave; la suite de l'&eacute;volution des conditions sociales. Bien que
cette doctrine ait &eacute;t&eacute; rejet&eacute;e formellement par la Cour supr&ecirc;me du Canada, cet article sugg&egrave;re que par la suite, l'approche s'est manifest&eacute;e dans la jurisprudence sous d'autres formes et appellations. L'article expose les raisons et hypoth&egrave;ses qui sont &agrave; l'origine du rejet de cette doctrine par la cour et les examine d'un &aelig; il critique dans l'optique de la th&eacute;orie l&eacute;gale et interpr&eacute;tative moderne. L'auteur soutient que l'acte d'interpr&eacute;ter, m&ecirc;me s'il est accompli dans le cadre de la volont&eacute; originale, est un acte fondamentalement subjectif qui d&eacute;ment en grande mesure l'objectivit&eacute; et la certitude que la cour a voulu y attribuer en rejetant la doctrine de l'objet variable.
L'auteur estime donc qu'on devrait reconsid&eacute;rer la doctrine de l'objet variable dans le cas o&ugrave; la loi est d&eacute;su&egrave;te ou d&eacute;phas&eacute;e. Cette conclusion s'accorde avec la tendance dans
d'autres domaines de remettre en question la dichotomie traditionnelle entre les fonctions l&eacute;gislative et judiciaire, et permet aux tribunaux d'assumer un r&ocirc;le plus dynamique pour faire face &agrave; des situations o&ugrave; les circonstances sociales ont &eacute;volu&eacute; consid&eacute;rablement.

mati&egrave;re d'appel public &agrave; l'&eacute;pargne
<p> 
 ST&Eacute;PHANE ROUSSEAU</h1>
<p><br>
<center><h3>ABSTRACT</h3></center>

Les deux derni&egrave;res d&eacute;cennies ont &eacute;t&eacute; marqu&eacute;es par l'&eacute;mergence de l'internationalisation des march&eacute;s de valeurs mobili&egrave;res. Ce ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne soul&egrave;ve de nombreux enjeux pour l'int&eacute;grit&eacute; du march&eacute; qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois et repr&eacute;sente un d&eacute;fi consid&eacute;rable pour la Commission des valeurs mobili&egrave;res du Qu&eacute;bec qui doit d&eacute;sormais r&eacute;glementer un march&eacute; caract&eacute;ris&eacute; par un nombre croissant d'activit&eacute;s d&eacute;bordant le cadre du territoire qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois.
<p>
En mati&egrave;re d'appel public &agrave; l'&eacute;pargne, la Commission doit concilier la promotion des objectifs de la <cite>Loi sur les valeurs mobili&egrave;res</cite> avec les limites de sa comp&eacute;tence qui se font de plus en plus apparentes. En ce sens, il est n&eacute;cessaire de proc&eacute;der &agrave; une r&eacute;vision du r&ocirc;le de la Commission des valeurs mobili&egrave;res du Qu&eacute;bec dans ce nouvel environnement afin de pr&eacute;server les objectifs fondamentaux de cette l&eacute;gislation de m&ecirc;me que la pertinence de la mission de la Commission.
<p>
Les enjeux soulev&eacute;s par ce ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne d'internationalisation seront d'autant plus consid&eacute;rables qu'ils proviendront tant des probl&egrave;mes soulev&eacute;s que des solutions qui sont maintenant propos&eacute;es par la voie de la coop&eacute;ration internationale.
<p>
The past two decades have been marked by the emergence of international securities markets. This development has
many potential ramifications for the integrity of the Qu&eacute;bec market and represents an important challenge for the Qu&eacute;bec Securities Commission, which now must regulate a market characterized by an increasing number of activities which are not confined within the territory of Qu&eacute;bec.
<p>
In the area of public securities offerings, the Commission must promote the objectives of the <cite>Securities Act</cite> within the increasingly apparent limits of its jurisdiction. Accordingly, it is necessary to review the role of the Qu&eacute;bec Securities Commission in this new environment in order to protect the fundamental purposes of the legislation and ensure the continued relevance of the Commission's mandate.
<p>
The importance of the internationalization phenomenon is reinforced by the fact that repercussions arise not only from the problems themselves but also from the solutions which are now being proposed through international cooperation.

<h1>Understanding Unconscionability: An Essay on Kant's Legal Theory
<p> 
ROBERT WISNER</h1>
<p><br>
<center><h3>ABSTRACT</h3></center>

This article presents the case for an understanding of unconscionability grounded in Immanuel Kant's vision of law. The author argues that the leading theories of unconscionability are incoherent and that an alternative approach is needed. Such an alternative is provided by Kant who, in sharp contrast to most contemporary scholars, does not view law as serving certain functions. Instead, he interprets legal categories as expressions of the capacity of human agents to exercise free will. This view of rights rules out any of the distributive concerns that apparently underlie the desire to redress &quot;inequality of bargaining power.&quot; The author argues, however, that two aspects of Kant's approach suggest another understanding of the doctrine. First, Kant's theory of contract provides a rationale for a broad defence of economic duress based on the coerciveness of a threat to violate a legal right. Second, the theory explains how the unity of wills and continuity of acts that result in contract formation also require some form of equivalence in exchange. Although the precise measure of equivalence is somewhat indeterminate, the theory does suggest why it should be based on departures from the prices of goods in competitive markets.
<p>
Cet article propose une th&eacute;orie du contrat abusif fond&eacute; sur la vision du droit pr&eacute;conis&eacute;e par Immanuel Kant. L'auteur soutient que les th&eacute;ories dominantes du contrat abusif manquent de coh&eacute;rence et qu'il est n&eacute;cessaire de recourir &agrave; une approche diff&eacute;rente. Une telle approche est offerte par Kant qui, par nette opposition &agrave; la plupart des penseurs modernes, ne consid&egrave;re pas le droit du point de vue des fonctions qu'il remplit. Selon lui, les cat&eacute;gories juridiques sont plut&ocirc;t l'expression de la capacit&eacute; d'agents humains d'exercer leur libre volont&eacute;. Dans cette perspective sur les droits, sont &eacute;cart&eacute;es toutes les questions d'ordre distributif qui, semble-t-il, sous-tendent le souhait de rem&eacute;dier l'&lt;&lt;in&eacute;galit&eacute; du pouvoir de n&eacute;gociation&gt;&gt;. Cependant, l'auteur soutient que deux aspects de l'approche de Kant sugg&egrave;rent une autre fa&ccedil;on de voir le contrat abusif. Premi&egrave;rement, la th&eacute;orie contractuelle de Kant offre une justification du moyen de d&eacute;fense de pressions &eacute;conomiques bas&eacute; sur le caract&egrave;re coercitif d'une menace de violation d'un droit l&eacute;gal. Deuxi&egrave;mement, la th&eacute;orie d&eacute;montre que l'&eacute;quivalence des volont&eacute;s et la continuit&eacute; des actes qui donnent lieu &agrave; un contrat n&eacute;cessitent aussi l'&eacute;quivalence des valeurs &eacute;chang&eacute;es. Bien que la notion d'&eacute;quivalence soit quelque peu ind&eacute;termin&eacute;e, la th&eacute;orie explique quand m&ecirc;me pourquoi l'&eacute;quivalence devrait d&eacute;pendre de l'&eacute;cart par rapport aux prix qui s'imposeraient en situation de concurrence.

<h1>Fugitive Rights: The Role of the <cite>Charter</cite> in Extradition Cases
<p> 
AMANDA J. SPENCER</h1>
<p><br>
<center><h3>ABSTRACT</h3></center>

Fugitives who attempt to take advantage of <cite>Charter</cite> protections in their fight against extradition face an
uphill battle in the light of the tests established by the majority decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in six extradition cases. The majority has adopted a highly deferential standard that emphasizes international comity and the executive's experience in international matters. Dissenting judgments that proposed a broader interpretation of the <cite>Charter</cite> guarantees have not succeeded in modifying the restrictive approach taken to date. Canada is not unique in addressing the issue of the role of human rights in extradition cases. Similar questions have arisen in Europe and, to a lesser extent, in the United States. What remains to be seen, as future cases arise in Canada, is whether the Supreme Court will expand and clarify the circumstances in which <cite>Charter</cite> protection is available to an extraditee, or whether it will continue to hold that an extradition will rarely, if ever, violate the <cite>Charter</cite>.
<p>
Lorsque des fugitifs tentent d'invoquer &agrave; leur avantage la protection de la <cite>Charte</cite> dans leur lutte contre l'extradition, ils se lancent dans une aventure p&eacute;rilleuse compte tenu des tests &eacute;tablis par les d&eacute;cisions majoritaires de la Cour Supr&ecirc;me du Canada dans six cas d'extradition. Invoquant les normes de courtoisie internationale et le besoin de s'en remettre &agrave; l'exp&eacute;rience de l'ex&eacute;cutif en ces mati&egrave;res, la majorit&eacute; de la Cour en est venue &agrave; adopter un standard de haute d&eacute;f&eacute;rence. Les jugements dissidents favorisant une interpr&eacute;tation plus g&eacute;n&eacute;reuse de la <cite>Charte</cite> n'ont pas r&eacute;ussi &agrave; modifier l'approche restrictive adopt&eacute;e jusqu'&agrave; maintenant. Le Canada n'est seul &agrave; confronter le probl&egrave;me du r&ocirc;le des droits de la personnes dans les cas d'extraditions. Des cas semblables se sont pr&eacute;sent&eacute;s en Europe et, dans une moindre mesure, aux Etats-Unis. Il reste &agrave; savoir si au cours des d&eacute;cisions futures au Canada, la Cour Supr&ecirc;me &eacute;largira et pr&eacute;cisera les circonstances dans lesquelles une personne faisant face &agrave; une extradition peut b&eacute;f&eacute;ficier de la protection de la <cite>Charte</cite> ou si elle continuera de soutenir que l'extradition n'enfreint la <cite>Charte</cite> que tr&egrave;s rarement.

<h1>Construing <cite>Delgamuukw</cite>:  Legal Arguments, Historical Argumentation, and the Philosophy of History
<p> 
JOEL R. FORTUNE</h1>
<p><br>
<center><h3>ABSTRACT</h3></center>

History figures prominently in the rhetoric of aboriginal rights. In this comment, the author argues that a closer
examination of the concept of history is needed in order to understand its significance to the debate. The use of history in the recent decision of the British Columbia Supreme Court, <cite>Delgamuukw v. British Columbia</cite>, is evaluated with reference to specific historical problems identified by philosophers of
history. The case represents a fundamental challenge to the traditional, Western notion of history and, by implication, to the established use of history in law. It is argued that a deeper understanding of what is meant by &quot;history&quot; will require a sympathetic response from the law to the Gitskan and Wet'suwet'en challenge. The author contends that, although many philosophical issues were openly discussed in <cite>Delgamuukw</cite>, the presiding judge ultimately failed to account for the problematic nature of history. In the end, the dominant culture merely asserted its historical vision over that proposed by the Gitskan and Wet'suwet'en.
<p>
L'histoire figure de fa&ccedil;on pro&eacute;minente dans la rh&eacute;torique des droits autochtones. Dans cet article, l'auteur soutient qu'un examen plus attentif du concept d'histoire est n&eacute;cessaire si l'on veut  r&eacute;ellement saisir son importance dans ce d&eacute;bat. L'utilisation de l'histoire dans <cite>Delgamuukw v. British Columbia</cite>, une d&eacute;cision r&eacute;cente de la Cour Supr&ecirc;me de la Colombie-Britannique, est &eacute;valu&eacute;e par rapport aux probl&egrave;mes historiques sp&eacute;cifiques qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; identifi&eacute;s par des philosophes sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;s en histoire. L'arr&ecirc;t remet s&eacute;rieusement en question la notion occidentale traditionnelle de l'histoire et, en cons&eacute;quence, l'usage qui en est fait en droit. Il est sugg&eacute;r&eacute; qu'une compr&eacute;hension plus approfondie de la notion d'&quot;histoire&quot; appellera une r&eacute;ception favorable aux requ&ecirc;tes des Gitskan et Wet'Suwet'en.
L'auteur est d'avis que bien que plusieurs points philosophiques aient &eacute;t&eacute; discut&eacute;s ouvertement dans <cite>Delgamuukw</cite>, en fin de compte, le juge en chef a tout de m&ecirc;me  n&eacute;glig&eacute; de prendre en consid&eacute;ration la nature probl&eacute;matique de l'histoire. Au bout du
compte, la culture dominante a tout simplement impos&eacute; sa vision historique de pr&eacute;f&eacute;rence &agrave; celle des Gitskan et Wet'Suwet'en.

<h1>Language, Law and Social Power: <cite>Seaboyer; Gayme v. R.</cite> and A Critical Theory of Ideology
<p> 
MICHAEL D. SMITH</h1>
<p><br>
<center><h3>ABSTRACT</h3></center>

Over the last 20 years, the issue of male sexual violence has been a crucial point of mobilization for the women's
movement, and law has been one of the important sites for this struggle. Although feminist agitation for the reform of sexual assault law has met with periodic success, legislative victories have often been nullified in subsequent litigation. This pattern suggests that judicial conservatism remains a significant impediment to progressive social change. To illustrate this point, the author considers the approach taken by the Supreme Court of Canada in <cite>Seaboyer; Gayme v. R.</cite>, the controversial &quot;rape shield&quot; decision. Drawing on critical social theory, the author uses the concept of ideology to demonstrate how the majority judgment, as a form of ideological discourse, serves to reinforce the subordinate status of women. By challenging the legitimacy of the
common-sensical assumptions and discursive strategies embedded in this legal text, the author seeks to undermine the presumptive authority and factitious neutrality that commonly mystify the judicial manufacture of truth.
<p>
Au cours des 20 derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es, le probl&egrave;me de la violence sexuelle masculine a jou&eacute; un r&ocirc;le crucial dans la mobilisation du mouvement f&eacute;minin, et le droit s'est av&eacute;r&eacute; une dimension importante du d&eacute;bat. Bien que la campagne f&eacute;ministe en faveur d'une r&eacute;forme en mati&egrave;re d'aggression sexuelle ait port&eacute; fruit de fa&ccedil;on p&eacute;riodique, plusieurs victoires l&eacute;gislatives furent renvers&eacute;es au cours de litiges ult&eacute;rieurs. Cet &eacute;tat de choses sugg&egrave;re que le conservatisme judiciaire demeure un obstacle
important &agrave; une &eacute;volution sociale progressive. A titre d'illustration, l'auteur consid&egrave;re l'approche adopt&eacute;e par la Cour Supr&ecirc;me du Canada dans l'arr&ecirc;t <cite>Seaboyer; Gayme v. R.</cite>, mieux connue par la contreverse qu'il souleva au sujet de la loi prot&eacute;geant les victimes de viol. S'inspirant de th&eacute;orie sociale critique, l'auteur se fonde sur le concept id&eacute;ologique pour d&eacute;montrer comment le jugement majoritaire, en tant que forme de discours id&eacute;ologique, sert &agrave; renforcer le statut de subordination des femmes. En mettant en question la l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; des hypoth&egrave;ses et de la rh&eacute;torique qui soustendent le texte de loi, l'auteur tente d'affaiblir l'autorit&eacute; de pr&eacute;somption et la neutralit&eacute; factuelle qui mystifient commun&eacute;ment la
manufacture judiciaire de la v&eacute;rit&eacute;.

<H1>The Relevance of International Patenting and Plant Breeders' Protection
Systems to Kenya as a Developing Country: Myth or Reality? </H1>

<P>by James Otieno Odek</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>ABSTRACT</H3>

<P>This thesis evaluates the pertinence to Kenya of the principles and
standards of the TRIPs Agreement in the creation of local innovative and
adaptive research capabilities. It also examines the suitability of the
UPOV criteria for protection of new plant varieties to enhancing inventiveness
in Kenya. </P>

<P>The UPOV Convention and the TRIPs Agreement inaugurate comprehensive
principles and standards for international patenting and plant breeders'
protection that have altered the structure, function, and scope of technology
accessibility to developing countries. The TRIPs requirement that new plant
varieties must be protected either by patents or an effective <I>sui generis</I>
system makes it hard to divorce international patentability from the protection
of plant breeders. This difficulty invites a consideration of how plant
breeders' rights should be recognized and protected internationally. It
also solicits an analysis of the question of ownership of plant genetic
resources. </P>

<P>The proposition advanced in this study is that the principles and standards
sanctioned by the UPOV Convention and the TRIPs Agreement not only grant
preferential patent protection to enterprises of developed countries in
Kenya, but also condone the uncompensated extraction of plant genetic resources
from Kenya to developed countries. </P>

<P>Thesis thesis concludes by making an equitable case for the commodification
of plant genetic resources and proposes the conferral of ensuing proprietary
rights to groups and communities. A finding is also made that the principles
and standards inaugurated by the UPOV Convention and the TRIPs Agreement
represent a strong emphasis on private rights and a weak recognition of
the social obligations of patentees and holders of plant breeders' rights.
The principles also depict a limited role for public interest and institute
a non-viable public domain in international patentability. </P>

<H1>Legal and Operational Aspects of Direct Foreign Investment in China
</H1>

<P>by Guang Hua Yu</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>ABSTRACT</H3>

<P>This thesis examines the utilization of direct foreign investment (DFI)
in China. In a sovereign state in which laws and regulations safeguard
the interests of both the host country and foreign investors, direct foreign
investment can serve many useful purposes. By utilizing DFI, an economically
less developed country can benefit from foreign capital, technology and
managerial skills. Mobilization of external resources can be particularly
important to a country which was previously isolated from the outside world.
The dynamic impacts of DFI in a country such as China go beyond the benefits
measured by static economic indicators. </P>

<P>Current Chinese foreign investment policy encourages export-oriented
foreign enterprises and high technology enterprises. One purpose of this
thesis is to show that China's economic conditions and the policy objectives
inherent in its legal structure are very attractive to export-oriented
foreign enterprises which produce labour intensive products. Whereas these
enterprises from newly industrialized countries and regions are relatively
small is scale, they have contributed greatly to the improvement of China's
economy in general and its balance of payment position in particular. While
China's market and its rapid economic growth rate are very attractive to
multinational corporations, the present economic conditions and other constraints
inherent in its legal framework create many difficulties for these foreign
enterprises. The survey of foreign enterprises from Hong Kong and other
developed countries show these difficulties. </P>

<P>The main purpose of this thesis is, however, to examine China's foreign
investment laws and regulations. While the scope of these foreign investment
laws and regulations is extensive, the thesis focuses on the inducements
provided to foreign enterprises, foreign exchange regulations, provisions
for the protection of proprietary interests in technology, labour regulations,
and investment dispute settlement mechanisms. In addition to the analysis
of the characteristics of the laws and regulations in these areas, legal
problems in the laws pertaining to investment are examined, and the impact
of these laws and regulations is examined. The thesis will show also that
the foreign investment laws and regulations appear to reflect China's trade
and industrial policies, which are intended to exploit its comparative
advantage in producing labour intensive products and in adjusting to its
potential comparative advantage in manufacturing technology or knowledge-intensive
products. </P>

<P>The thesis examines also some non-legal factors which affect foreign
investment in China which are of considerable importance to foreign investors'
investment decisions. These non-legal factors can exert great impact on
the operation of foreign enterprises in the Chinese economy. Several chapters
have been devoted to the discussion of these non-legal factors and their
impact on different foreign enterprises. </P>

<li>You may use any kind of material you wish during the examination, for example, notes, the casebook, handouts, and texts, except books owned by the library.<p>
<li>This exam is composed of two questions. You must do both questions. Question 1 will count for two thirds of the mark allocation and Question 2 for one third. Hence you should allocate roughly two hours to answering Question 1 and one hour to Question 2.<P>
<li>Before you begin, ensure that you have written your pseudonym, course name, and the number of the booklet on <b>each</b> examination booklet and the name of the instructor on the <b>first</b> booklet. If you request an additional booklet(s) during the examination, write the required information on the booklet at the time you
receive it. No time will be permitted for this at the end of the examination.<P>
<li>During the examination, only one student at a time is permitted to leave the examination room. No student may leave within fifteen minutes of the conclusion of the examination.<P>
<li>At the end of this examination, the invigilator will ask you to stop writing, count the total number of booklets used, record this on the front of the first booklet, and insert all booklets into the first booklet. You will then gather your belongings and leave the examination room. <B>All examination answer booklets are to be left on the writing table and will be collected by the invigilator</b>.<P>
<li>Time limits will be strictly enforced. Students who continue to write after the examination has ended will have their answer booklets collected separately and may be subject to a penalty.

<p>
<b>Question 1<br>
Recall that this question counts for two thirds of the total mark allocation so that you should allocate roughly two hours to answering it. I have no set idea of how long your answer should be. My sense is that you may be best served by spending some time, say, 30 minutes or more planning your answer so that you can spend the remaining time setting our your answer by way of as discrete a set of discussions as is possible. Please also note that to do option A within Question 2, you have to have answered Question 1.</B>
<p>
In 1997 the Conservative Government of Ontario enacts the <cite>Privatisation of Public Powers Regulation Act</cite> (the Privatisation Act). The purpose of the Act is stated in section 1 to be:
<p>
'To oversee the transfer of power from the public to the private sector in order to ensure that the transfer takes place in an orderly and consistent fashion'.
<p>
 The Privatisation Act sets up a Privatisation Board, which, in terms of section 2.1 of the Act, is described thus:
<p>
'The Board shall establish policy in regard to the process of privatization. That policy will be binding on all disputes that may arise in regard to privatisation, including disputes in regard to the Board's jurisdiction over a matter.'
<p>
Section 2.3 makes it clear that the main function of the Board is policy-making. The Board may itself decide that a policy needs to be established in regard to an issue, or it may be asked by any interested party to consider making a policy. But in either case, the way it proceeds is by notice and comment. That is, before a policy can be made, the Board is required to make public its intention to consider a particular issue, and to invite participation by all interested parties in hearings.
<p>
Because it is anticipated that there might be some public sector resistance to the Board's authority, the Board is given by section 2.4 contempt powers, which include the power to fine or sentence to a short term of imprisonment those responsible for refusing to comply with policy established by the Board.
<p>
The first Chair of the Board is a retired judge of the Ontario Court of Appeal. The other four members consist of a retired judge of the Divisional Court of Ontario, a former member of a Conservative Party commission on privatisation, a retired policeman with extensive experience in the Police Services Union, and a law professor specializing in employment law.
<p>
At the same time, the Conservative Government amends the <cite>Public Service Employment Act</cite> of Ontario (the Employment Act), which governs labour relations in the public sector. The amendment which concerns us here removes from section 6 of the Employment Act subsection 6.6.
<p>
This subsection had been enacted by the previous New Democratic Party Government to make it clear that public service unions could include in their bargaining units employees of the companies which had received contracts to perform services previously performed by public service employees. The New Democratic Government had added this subsection to section 6 without further amendment, since that Government regarded the subsection as simply clarifying an interpretative dispute about the powers of the panels of the Public Service Board deciding disputes under public sector collective agreements. The Conservative Government simply removed the subsection.
<p>
As a result, section 6.1 of the Employment Act continues to read as follows:
<p>
6.1 - 'In any dispute as to whether a group of employees constitute a unit appropriate for collective bargaining, the Public Service Board shall determine that question.'
<p>
And section 7 of the Act continues to read as follows:
<p>
7 - 'The Public Service Board shall have final and conclusive authority to determine the law in any matter arising out of a collective agreement, including authority to determine whether an employee is an employee for the purposes of this Act.'
<p>
The Chair of the Public Service Board, Leah Alensa, when asked for her comment on the enactment of the Privatisation Act, said the following.
<p>
'I was appointed to my position because I am known to be someone capable of giving strong leadership in difficult times. We are in those times, and we are going to see an attempt by private power to recreate the inequalities of the past. I will do my best to resist this process'.
<p>
Hospitals in Toronto, which have just been hit by another reduction in their base operating grant, then decide to contract out the bulk of their cleaning services for their hospitals. The Hospital Services Union of Ontario applies to the Public Service Board to include the workers of Speedy Cleaning Services, which has been awarded the contract, in the Hospital Services bargaining unit. The effect would be to include the workers within the scope of the collective agreement between the hospitals and the Union. This application is fully supported by the (otherwise non-unionized) employees of Speedy.
<p>
A tri-partite panel of the Public Service Board convenes to hear this application. Speedy opposes the application on two grounds. First, Speedy argues that the legislative amendment which deleted section 6.6 makes it clear that the panel has no jurisdiction over workers in the private sector. Second, Speedy points out that the issue of statutory interpretation of section 6 is now before the Privatisation Board. For, at the request of various employers' associations, the Privatisation Board is considering whether it should issue a policy statement clarifying the situation in respect of public service unions and employees of private sector companies who have been awarded contracts to do work formerly performed by public service employees.
<p>
Speedy thus argues that the panel should not make any decision prior to the Privatisation Board's determination. The Hospital Services Union argues that the matter is before the proper forum and that the Public Service Board has jurisdiction since the Conservative Government had not clarified the law, but merely returned it to its formerly ambiguous state.
<p>
In discussion after the hearing, the panel members consider whether a full board meeting should be convened to discuss the policy implications of its decision. Two members decide that such a meeting should be convened, but the third has been convinced by Speedy's arguments and sees no need for such a meeting. Against his wishes, a full board meeting is convened. In terms of the customary procedures, all three members attend the meeting, as does Alensa, Chair of the Board. (There is a register of attendance, but no minutes are taken, and no formal attempt is made to ascertain a consensus on the issue.) Speedy's counsel is tipped off about the full board meeting, but his request to be present at the meeting is denied.
<p>
After the meeting the panel reconvenes and the three members hand down a unanimous, closely reasoned decision which upholds the union's argument. That is, the panel declares Speedy's workers to fall within the scope of the collective agreement in the performance of their hospital cleaning services.
<p>
Part of the panel's decision reads as follows:
<p>
'To repeat the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Canada in a rather different context, the Legislature, in enacting the Employment Act made a 'policy choice' as to who is best placed to decide employment issues in the context of public sector employment relations (see <cite>Domtar Inc. v. Quebec</cite> [1993] SCR 756 (Que), Evans <U>et al.</U>, <cite>Administrative Law</cite>, 936, at 949.) To hold otherwise would be to hold that the Legislature has deliberately altered a long established and 'delicate institutional relationship' (Domtar at 946)'; and we would need very clear words to that effect, whether the relationship be between this tribunal and the courts, or between it and other tribunals. The statute under which we are appointed enjoins us in terms of section 1 to avoid imbalances of power in the public sector, and our decision does no more than reflect our statutory mandate'.
<p>
Shortly thereafter, the Privatisation Board convenes a hearing to discuss the situation in respect of public service unions and employees of private sector companies who have been awarded contracts to do work formerly performed by public service employees. The Board gives all interested parties a full opportunity to participate in the hearing.
<p>
At the hearing, various public service unions argue that the privatization policy made by the Privatisation Board should not be in conflict with the determinations of the Public Service Board. The Privatisation Board rejects this argument, saying that it would make a nonsense out of its policy-making function were its discretion to be fettered by the decisions of tripartite panels of another administrative agency.
<p>
Further, the Privatisation Board reasons that the inclusion of private sector workers within the scope of protection of public sector collective agreements will create instability in employment relations and that the legislative amendment to the Employment Act by the Conservative Government was clearly intended to avoid such instability. Hence, it establishes as a binding policy directive that private sector workers cannot be employees for the purposes of section 6 of the Employment Act. It also announces that non-compliance with this directive will be met by full use of its contempt powers.
<p>
The Hospital Services Union approaches you for advice. They are prepared to fight the decision of the Privatisation Board up to the Supreme Court of Canada if need be, but they are also concerned to preserve the decision of the Public Service Board.
<p><br>
<b>Question 2.<br>
Answer only one of the following; that is, answer either A or B or C. Recall that this question counts for one third of the total mark allocation so that you should allocate roughly one hour to it. Note: To do A, you must have answered Question 1 first.</b>
<p>
<b>A.</b> Reconsider your answer to Question 1 (the problem). Assume that you are drafting a report about administrative law reform. Give an account of how the central issues which you discussed arose and justify your recommendations as to reform. You may refer back extensively to your answer to question 1.
<p>
<b>B.</b> Discuss the principle of judicial deference to tribunal determinations of the law in the light of the Supreme Court of Canada's decisions in <cite>Dayco</cite> (Evans <U>et al.</U>, 857 and 951) and <cite>Bradco</cite> (Evans <U>et al.</U>, <cite>Administrative Law</cite>, 955).
<p>
<b>C.</b> Evaluate the thesis of the extract on page 7 of the exam from the <cite>Globe and Mail</cite> (January 29, 1996) in the light of your understanding of the place of judicial review in the Canadian legal order.

GLOBE AND MAIL<BR>
JANUARY 29, 1996
<p>
In his Jan. 17 column (The Courts or the Public Square), Michael Valpy referred to a then-forthcoming public forum on Ontario's omnibus bill. The forum, held in Toronto on Jan. 24 and organized by an ad-hoc group of lawyers and legal academics (including the authors of this piece), was designed to inform political debate by focusing attention on the ways Bill 26 would undermine fundamental rights.
<p>
The bill would confer on the cabinet regulatory powers that could override enacted legislation. It would limit government liability to compensate those whose interests are adversely affected. It would erode basic principles that entitle those whose interests are affected to receive notice and be heard. It would expand government access.to private information while limiting public access to government information. The government thus proposes to implement its policies of cost efficiency through greater concentration of government power - a move that would, ironically, lead to more government, not less.
<p>
It is appropriate for lawyers and legal academics to focus attention on these issues, but Mr. Valpy seemed to question the bona fides of the forum because one of the organizers was constitutional litigator Mary Eberts (co-author of this piece). Referring to an argument by Ms. Eberts in Ontario Divisional Court against the. government's cuts to welfare benefits, Mr. Valpy asked, &quot;Are charter challenges in the courts an inappropriate alternative to political action?&quot; He questioned the very idea of, as he put it, &quot;the courtroom as an alternative to the political arena.&quot;
<p>
We wish to address his underlying assumption: that court proceedings and the political process are mutually exclusive and that right-thinking citizens must choose between them.
<p>
Bill 26 has galvanized many individuals and groups to political action. Nonetheless, it may be passed by Ontario's majority government without sufficient opportunity in the legislative process to address the implications of the bill's complex, wide-ranging provisions. While it is desirable that important issues of the day be hammered out in the political arena, the possibility of judicial review imposes discipline on governments where self-restraint is insufficient, and offers a way to restrain government power, safeguard liberties and preserve democratic values.
<p>
We need the legislative and judicial processes to interact with each other. That way, we ensure that majoritarian legislatures respect our democratic traditions and rights, while making sure that appointed judges hearing single cases do not substitute their judgments for those of the legislative process, with its capacity for comprehensive assessment of social needs and careful consensus-building.
<p>
There is no doubt that legislatures offer advantages as forums for deciding policies and priorities. Elections provide a mandate as Novell as accountability. Legislative hearings when they work effectively, let the government canvass a broad range of views in developing legislation. Effective debate in the assembly alerts the public to flaws in government policy and administration. Unless the government has a comfortable and disciplined majority, it is continuously accountable by reason of its need to maintain the confidence of the legislature.
<p>
Yet the courts play an important role in restraining the exercise of government power, on at least three grounds: when it exceeds the legislative jurisdiction assigned to it in our federal system; when it infringes rights guaranteed by the Charter of Rights; and when it breaches common-law principles that require government officials (a) to obey the law, (b) to observe principles of fairness and due process, and (c) to act within their authority. These restraints enhance the legitimacy of democratic government.
<p>
Strategic litigation may also help influence the political process. A minonty that cannot muster enough support to affect that process may be able to assert its interest in court as a legally protected right. Even if the case is unsuccessful, the public attention it draws may jumpstart the political process and lead to legislative change.
<p>
Democracy in Ontario today faces challenges from a party with a large majority, a continued high standing in the polls and sweeping ideas about what powers it needs to accomplish its mission. It is important that we consider, in public debate, the potential impacts of this agenda.
<p>
If public debate is ineffective, we may have resort to the courts - not to assess government policy, but to ensure that its implementation does not breach basic rights.

<h3>Note:</h3>
<ol>
<li>You may use any kind of material you wish during the examination, for example, notes, the casebook, and texts, except books owned by the library.
<P>
<li>The exam is composed of two questions of equal weight. <B>Please read the following instructions carefully.</B>
<P>
<b>Question One</b> asks you to outline the issues; this part of the question is worth <b>50%</b> of the marks for Question One. You can identify issues as a question to be resolved and may use point-form and sub-issues. Define the issue as narrowly as possible (e.g. whether good faith term will be implied by court; whether Software Inc. will be at risk under &quot;springboard&quot; doctrine of losing flexibility to use ideas it develops on project with
Marketing Options for other projects/customers); at times you may want to note a relevant fact or case but do not get into detailed analysis and argument. You should not resolve the issue in the outline; however, if you identify an issue for the purpose of showing that it is a non-issue (i.e. clearly resolved one way or the other) note this clearly. (And if its really <b>not an issue,</b> leave it out.) Your goal in the outline is to demonstrate that you have recognized the issues. The second part of Question One asks you to analyse in detail one or two issues. Whether you
write on one or two issues will depend on the &quot;meatiness&quot; of the issues you choose and your treatment of them. I will be looking for your judgment about what is an important issue and the quality of your reasoning and legal argument. Only go on to a second issue if you think you can do so without compromising the quality of the analysis on the first issue. Above all, do not merely assert legal conclusions; I will be looking for solid argument.
<P>
<B>Question Two </B>asks you to identify the arguments you could make as the basis for a breach of contract action. This part of the question is worth <b>20%</b>. You need only identify the doctrinal basis for each argument (e.g. implied term to exercise due care in choosing between aereal and reserves pooling; breach of confidence in using information Corona revealed to acquire Williams' property. You are then asked to provide detailed analysis of what you consider to be the one or two most important issues or bases for the breach of contract action. Again, the emphasis here is on choosing an important issue or issues and developing carefully reasoned analysis. A creative,
persuasive treatment of a single issue will do well; so will solid treatments of two different issues. I suggest you move onto a second issue if you find your treatment of the first issue is in danger of getting into repetitive or unpersuasive arguments. I will also be taking into account the difficulty of the issue in light of the caselaw; a strong creative argument on a hard issue to win will also be rewarded.
<P>
<li>Before you begin, ensure that you have written your pseudonym, course name, and the number of the booklet on each examination booklet and the name of the instructor on the <b>first</b> booklet. If you request an additional booklet(s) during the examination, write the required information on the booklet at the time you receive it. No time will be permitted for this at the end of the examination.
<P>
<li>During the examination, only one student at a time is permitted to leave the examination room. No student may leave within fifteen minutes of the conclusion of the examination.
<P>
<li>At the end of this examination, the invigilator will ask you to stop writing, count the total number of booklets used, record this on the front of the first booklet, and insert all booklets into the first booklet. You will then gather your belongings and leave the examination room. <B>All examination answer booklets are to be left on the writing table and will be collected by the invigilator.</B>
<P>
<li>Time limits will be strictly enforced. Students who continue to write after the examination has ended will have their answer booklets collected separately and may be subject to a penalty.

<h3>Question 1 (50%)</h3>

Innovata Inc. is a well-known manufacturer of components used in the production of televisions, stereos and other electronic consumer products. For a number of years, Hi-Fi Inc. has been a customer of Innovata's, ordering components as needed from Innovata's wholesale catalogue using Innovata's standard form sales contract. Hi-Fi has frequently advertised the fact that it uses Innovata components and Innovata itself often advertises the quality, safety
and reliability of its components in magazines such as &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; which is read by consumers. (Faulty components reduce quality and reliability; can cause damage to the equipment in which they are installed, other equipment to which they are connected and software such as CDs; and may pose a fire hazard.
The more sophisticated the electronics, the lower the tolerance for deviations from design specifications.)
<P>
Recently, Hi-Fi has been experiencing financial difficulties in the face of strong global competition. They have approached Innovata and told them that they are interested in forming a supply alliance, modelled on the Japanese &quot;keiretsu&quot; but with some &quot;Western&quot; style changes. They referred Innovata to an article in the Wall Street Journal [<a href="#attached">attached</a>] which discusses the benefits of a supply alliance. Hi-Fi's goal is to increase its competitiveness by spurring innovation in components to improve the performance of Hi-Fi products, reducing the cost of coordinating Hi-Fi's activities and Innovata's activities, and reducing the total cost of Hi-Fi products. Hi-Fi has told Innovata that it wants to follow the lead of Chrysler, Motorola and Marks &amp; Spencer: focus negotiations on underlying costs while protecting Innovata's profit margin, adopt measures such as technical help, fair risk sharing and respect for proprietary information. Hi-Fi has told Innovata that they envisage a  cooperative give-and-take process by which Hi-Fi and Innovata exchange information to improve the final product while reducing costs: HiFi will keep Innovata up to date about its needs and prospects for developing new and/or modified products; Innovata will respond with ideas, information about its own plans and prospects for new components and provide test components. Hi-Fi anticipates that Innovata will work with HiFi to sort out and correct shortfalls, be they in performance (relative to the newest products coming on the market) or other criteria such as cost or safety. Hi-Fi has also mentioned that they are hoping that inventories of components would be held either by Innovata or by Hi-Fi depending at any given time on the relative costs of holding inventory for each and demand conditions (that is, Hi-Fi's abilities to sell what it has in stock.) At the same time Hi-Fi hopes to be able to reduce inventory costs by arranging for deliveries closer to critical production deadlines. Hi-Fi has said that if they can get a supply alliance up and running, they are planning some significant increases in capital investments in order to maximize the benefits of the arrangement.
<P>
Hi-Fi has said that they want to put nothing in writing and to rely on goodwill as the basis for the alliance.
<P>
Innovata is seeking advice on this proposed change in their relationship with Hi-Fi. Please outline the issues you think Innovata should be aware of in deciding how to proceed on Hi-Fi's proposal. Innovata is particularly interested in knowing whether there are contract provisions without which it might be too risky to proceed but are sympathetic with HiFi's interest in relying on trust rather than contract. Please also give me a detailed analysis of one or two issues that you consider to be important at this stage.
<P><br>
<h3>Question Two (50%)</h3>

BoldNet is a company that was formed by a group of computer afficionados in the 1980's when the Internet was almost exclusively used by academics and the military for transferring data and messages. BoldNet recognized early on the commercial potential of the net and began working on developing the software to configure access systems for commercial users that would facilitate electronic shopping. With so few consumers on line, these early phases were more in the line of a hobby than a business, but the reputation of this group for anticipating far-reaching changes in technology and applications spread rapidly among those in the know. Five years ago BoldNet decided it was time to go big and embarked on a franchising plan whereby they would sell to franchisees the right to use the BoldNet system to market consumer products. Franchisees operate as highly specialized electronic &quot;department stores&quot;. Individual franchisees are allocated a &quot;territory&quot; defined as a set of consumer criteria such as &quot;young professionals age 25-32, unmarried, who like new country music,  southwestern furnishings, J. Crew&quot; etc. The territories are in fact not defined by preexisting criteria, but rather developed on the basis  of interaction between consumers and the advertising and catalogues that consumers &quot;browse&quot; when they go to a franchisee's home page on the WorldWideWeb. (Consumers click on questions or products on the screen in order to learn more or purchase products; as they click, the system records their choices and can cross-reference these preferences with those who have made similar choices to develop a profile of a very narrow market niche.) BoldNet updates the territories monthly; the franchise contract sets out complicated guidelines that BoldNet follows in ensuring that a franchisee's territory grows or shrinks according to the demands of the consumers initially in the territory and not because of an outright transfer of consumers to another franchisee's territory that is not justified by underlying changes in taste and spending patterns. Franchisees
are responsible for maintaining the home page and updating it, all by following detailed instructions from BoldNet. They also perform the role of ensuring that orders for products are filled and deal with complaints or problems from customers or suppliers; all this information is also recorded on software from BoldNet and becomes part of the database on which BoldNet draws in selecting suppliers and products and defining territories. Franchisees must make significant investments in computer hardware and purchase BoldNet software on an ongoing basis; they also pay a $50,000 franchise fee upfront. Franchisees are invariably <b>not</b> computer experts and often have little expertise or experience in retailing, sales or the electronics industry.
<P>
Five years ago, when they began the franchise operation, BoldNet had already realized that future changes in technology and software would produce a rate of expansion in the electronic shopping market that would require frequent changes in the configuration of their system, necessitating frequent conversions in hardware, software
and procedures by franchisees. These were the same technological changes that BoldNet alone anticipated would open up the market for the highly targeted style of electronic shopping that was the cornerstone of its unique service in the market when it commenced operations. Nobody else had anticipated anything beyond electronic purchases from catalogues prepared by traditional retailers; nobody else had anticipated the nature of the rapidly and interactively developing consumer market on-line. Naturally enough, this was a highly-guarded secret at BoldNet.
<P>
John Simms is an ex-accountant who was looking for an investment in early 1991. He knew little about computers, and nothing about the Internet, but when a friend suggested he look into the franchise opportunity BoldNet was advertising, he quickly saw the potential for a lucrative venture. He eagerly read over the brochures BoldNet sent him explaining the franchise, wrote a cheque for $50,000, signed the standard form franchise agreement without legal advice and signed up for the month-long training session at BoldNet. Within two months he had invested another $400,000 in equipment and software and was up and running. Business was slow at first and he lost money the first year. BoldNet required some software changes in the configuration at the end of the first year, which cost him $35,000. By the second year he was earning reasonable profits even though twice during the second year he had to invest in further configuration changes for a total of $100,000. A similar pattern continued up until six months ago.
<P>
Six months ago Simms began to notice that configuration changes were coming from BoldNet somewhat more frequently than before but profits were not keeping up; indeed, gross sales were beginning to fall. For a little over a year he had been recording an increasing rate of consumer complaints and returns related to poor quality and had a number of puzzling episodes of transactions that were very difficult to trace and suppliers that were difficult to track
down for returns or product repairs. Last week Simms was stunned when he opened up the newspaper to see a full page announcement from BoldNet that, &quot;boldly going where no company had ever been before,&quot; the company was embarking on a new electronic shopping arrangement whereby all transactions would take place
centrally through BoldNet. The information at the website readers of the advertisement were directed to explained that BoldNet, again on the leading edge, had begun to recognize over a year ago that the net was becoming corrupted with copycat electronic retailers, fly-by-night manufacturers and Internet vandals who destroyed or altered advertising, product descriptions, consumer information or transaction data. BoldNet had developed a complete new system that leapt ahead of existing technology and would not be made available to franchisees for
security reasons.
<P>
Needless to say, Simms' franchise business is a big loser in all of this. He has asked you to file suit for him for breach of the franchise agreement. On discovery, you have learned that BoldNet deliberately introduced frequent configuration changes over the last year, which cost Simms a total of $200,000, but which were designed solely to ensure that potential competitors (including franchisees) did not figure out what BoldNet was planning and
so could not get a jump on BoldNet's major switch. BoldNet is now the leading electronic retailer but it depends on being the first in the market with system changes to secure customers by getting them attached to its system.
<P>
On reading the franchise agreement, you have learned that it says nothing about configuration changes and contains essentially no clauses that purport to limit BoldNet's discretion in any way beyond the provisions limiting the manner in which BoldNet adjusts territories. It does contain a clause which says &quot;The relationship between the parties is only that of independent arm's length contractors. No partnership, joint venture or relationship of principal and agent is intended,&quot; and a clause which prohibits Simms, if he ceases to be a franchisee for any reason, from engaging in electronic retailing or any computer-related business which competes with BoldNet.
<P>
Please identify what you consider to be the arguments you could make for breach of contract. Please also provide detailed analysis of what you consider to be the one or two most important issues you would argue on Simms behalf. (Be sure to deal with the weaknesses as well as the strengths of your argument.)

<h1 align=center>Business World</h1>
<h2 align=center>By Jordan D. Lewis</h2>

Japanese keiretsu which link customer firms with their captive suppliers have long been regarded as a key to Japan's business success. But today a new kind of keiretsu is taking over - and this time it comes not from Japan but from the West. Considering that the average Western company spends more than 50 cents of every revenue dollar on suppliers (the figure is even higher in Japan) the value a firm gets from its suppliers is critical to its success.
<P>
In the past the Japanese tradition of customer-supplier cooperation for continuous improvement brought substantial advances In quality and reductions In cost. Meanwhile, Western firms traditional arm's length relationships with, and frequent hostility toward their suppliers frustrated any kind of teamwork.
<P>
But the traditional Japanese keiretsu also have big defects which are now being exposed by the new Western versions. In Japan captive suppliers march to the customer firm's sole drumbeat. Since the suppliers are guaranteed business and are insulated from direct interactions with the marketplace they are less inclined to innovate. That s not true for independent suppliers, whose survival depends on staying at the cutting edge of their fields. But in Japan's group-oriented culture the independents have a hard time forging close relationships with customer firms which inhibits the flow of innovations.
<P>
The West has found some stunning answers to these problems in a new style of customer-supplier relationship. Being pioneered by firms such as Chrysler, Motorola and British retailer Marks &amp; Spencer, these advances achieve high levels of supplier Innovation and substantial customer-suppler integration.  The result is superior performance. Since embracing supply alliances in 1990, Chrysler has become North America's lowest-cost, highest-profit per vehicle auto maker.
<P>
Motorola's Paging Products Group has won 60% global market share due partly to cooperation with suppliers that has brought significant advances in cost quality cycle time and technology. Supply costs have fallen 8% to 10% a year for many years. On the other hand Philips Consumer Electronics Co. - which buys the same kinds of items as Motorola but does not have alliances with its suppliers - has seen costs go down at only about half this rate.
<P>
Marks &amp; Spencer offers yet another case for the value of Western-grown keiretsu. Marks &amp; Spencer teams with its suppliers constantly pushing the frontiers of value in food clothing and home furnishings. Such close collaboration resulted in the easy-to-iron cotton shirt and machine-washable silk and lambswool knitwear among other developments. It also markedly reduced the cycle time between factory order and store receipt of piece-dyed knitwear from 12 to 16 weeks to a few days.
<P>
Central to the success of such advances is suppliers independence which helps encourage innovation. Customers support this by limiting their volume with each supplier to a small share of its business.
<P>
Another key is integration of customer and supplier activities which replaces arm's length bidding the traditional exchange of specification from the customer and price from the supplier. Integration lets both firms maximize their combined performance rather than each one's separate performance.
<P>
As an example consider cost. Only by identifying all cost sources for both customer and supplier - and understanding how they interact - can total cost be trimmed to the lowest levels. Take Chrysler. Teaming with a supplier, it developed a new part that, though costlier than the original part, reduced total vehicle cost by shortening assembly lime. The same logic applies to issues of quality and response time, where the goal is to improve together, rather than alone.
<P>
To earn suppliers' loyalty Chrysler, Motorola and Marks &amp; Spencer focus their negotiations on underlying costs while protecting suppliers' margins. Other measures such as technical help, fair risk sharing and respect for proprietary information are all aimed at winning and keeping suppliers' commitments.
<P>
In a practice that might seem more Asian than Western, most of these new customer-supplier relationships are based on trust, not contracts. Legal documents can't cover the many joint activities and high flexibility needed for substantial integration. Marks &amp; Spencer has no contracts with its suppliers; Chrysler and Motorola
use simple one-page agreements.
<P>
Motorola wants to be its suppliers' best customer and to that end uses supplier surveys and internal performance measures to keep moving in this direction. Marks &amp; Spencer monitors suppliers' financial health because the retailer needs them to remain strong, invest for the future and stay committed to its objectives.
<P>
Building these new relationships takes a real break with the past. To appreciate the consequences of the traditional ways,  consider recent events al General Motors.
<P>
In 1992 under a new purchasing chief GM demanded double-digit price cuts from suppliers and broke long-term
contracts to get them. In a quest for lower bids, GM also shared proprietary know-how among rival suppliers. Results were damaging: Suppliers withheld their newest developments from GM and shifted their brightest engineers to projects for other auto makers that treated their suppliers like partners. Further, a six-week shutdown
of Buick Roadmaster production at GM's Arlington, Texas plant was the result of the use of an ill-filling ashtray from a new supplier whose ashtray was cheaper but substandard. Perhaps the worst outcome was earlier this year when suppliers thwarted GM's plans to cut back its work force by refusing to take on tasks that GM performed in-house.
<P>
Since the start of Japan's economic decline earlier in this decade, some keiretsu suppliers there have broken their bonds of exclusivity and sought additional customers. But such initiatives are more an exception than a widespread practice. Further, Japanese customer firms have held their keiretsu suppliers to extremely thin margins. The newly free suppliers, which still get much of their business from their old masters, are a long way from being able to support significant R&amp;D.
<P>
There's little doubt that Japanese companies eventually will adopt supply methods that combine high degrees of innovation and integration. But the timing is hard to forecast. Obviously, they have adapted some Western practices in other areas, just as Western companies have adapted some of theirs. Nonetheless, the traditional keiretsu are no longer the model of best practice. For this, one has to look to the West.

<B>Question One: </B>75 Minutes
<P>
Michelle and Robert began living together in June, 1989. For their family's sake, they went through a religious marriage on September 3rd, 1991, but without a marriage licence. Michelle thought it was a valid marriage because she knew nothing about a licence requirement. Robert knew there was a problem, but he wanted to make his parents happy without making a formal commitment to Michelle. When Michelle learned of the problem, she persuaded Robert to take her to City Hall on August 1st, 1994, and properly marry her.
<P>
The marriage broke down in February, 1996, when Robert left Michelle for his best friend, Roger. Michelle was absolutely devastated since she was pregnant at the time and never suspected that her husband was involved with someone else.
<P>
In October, 1986, Michelle inherited her late aunt's cottage on Stoney Lake. It was then worth $280,000, with a mortgage of $55,000. The parties used it regularly from the time they began living together until their separation. It has never changed in value, but the mortgage principal has declined at the rate of $1,000 per year since acquisition.
<P>
In 1988, Michelle was in a car accident and under the law then existing she had a pending claim for pain and suffering and lost income. The claim was settled on August 31st, 1991. Michelle received $35,000 for pain and suffering and $15,000 for lost income. She put the $50,000 settlement into the Toronto Dominion Bank and
immediately thereafter bought a one-year term deposit in the amount of $50,000. She continues on a yearly basis
to roll the term deposit over into a new term deposit. Each time, she simply reinvests the interest earned on the previous term deposit. In February, 1996, the term deposit then in place had a total value of $70,000.00, inclusive of interest.
<P>
Michelle had a student loan outstanding for many years. In September, 1991, the balance was $14,000 and by August 1, 1994, it was paid down to $7,000. In February, 1996, she still owed $1,000.00 on the loan. Michelle had a car that was worth $8,000 in September, 1991, and only $3,000 by July, 1994. She gave the car to her brother, Stanley. Shortly after, she and Robert married at City Hall.
<P>
In 1993, Robert won Lottario and used the winnings of $350,000 to purchase a home. He put it in Michelle's name to protect himself and Michelle if his business went sour. The house never changed in value until January, 1996, when the TTC put a bus route and parking lot nearby causing the house to drop in value by $60,000.
<P>
Robert is a mining speculator and his business fluctuates in value, depending on the stock market. In 1989, his business was worth $500,000. By September, 1991, it had fallen to $290,000 and by August, 1994, it was back to $350,000. In February, 1996, it was worth $450,000.
<p>
In 1992, Robert was sued for defamation in connection with some comments he made at a board meeting in December, 1991. His litigation lawyer has given Robert his opinion that Robert may well be liable and will likely have to pay about $50,000, inclusive of the claim, interest and costs.
<P>
Robert and Michelle each received a gift of $10,000 from Michelle's mother in October, 1991. Robert used his for an expensive vacation for both of them. Michelle used hers to buy a painting by Esmeraldi. The artist died in a fire six months ago and many of his paintings were destroyed. As a result, the painting is now worth $100,000. The painting has always been displayed in Robert's office and for that reason, Robert claims the painting is his. Michelle says the painting belongs to her. She acknowledges that it has been hanging in Robert's office. However, for the life of her, she can't remember why or how it came to be hanging in Robert's office.
<P>
Robert collects ancient coins. His father got him started on the hobby. In 1991, Robert's coins were worth $5,000.00. Robert's father died in 1992 and left Robert $58,000 worth of coins. Their value stayed the same until recently when one of the coins has become much sought after. The original coins left by Robert's father are now worth $90,000. Robert has also added to the collection on his own and in the last year, has acquired further coins worth $25,000. In total, the collection is now worth $175,000.
<P>
Michelle has come to see you. She has heard that there is some formula for dividing property in Ontario, but she doesn't understand it. She wants you to tell her what will happen in a court if they can't work out a solution on their own. Please do so, giving brief reasons for your opinion, including your calculation of the equalization payment owing.
<P><br>
<B>Question #2:</b> 45 Minutes
<P>
When Harry met Sally, they were both 24. Both were in teacher's college and both planned to teach high school upon graduation. After a whirlwind courtship, they were married in their last year of school in 1980. Unfortunately, the economy had already begun to change and Harry was unable to find full-time work as a teacher. Sally was more fortunate and was hired immediately, probably because she stood first in her class. Harry continued to work as a supply teacher, but he obtained less and less assignments and after a while, he had virtually no work being offered to him as a teacher. Sally and Harry wanted to have children, but they could not afford to have Sally give up her job, particularly because she was about to be appointed Vice-Principal. Accordingly, they decided that Sally would take two months maternity leave and, thereafter, Harry would stay home and look after the child. The hope was that the
economy would improve and Harry would get back to work full-time within three years. To their very great surprise, in 1987, Sally had twin boys and, unfortunately, one had serious respiratory problems which required constant care for the first four years (mostly by Harry). Further, Harry and Sally had a third son in 1990 and, accordingly, the plan for Harry to return to work could not be put in place. Firstly, the children needed one parent at
home, and secondly, the situation for teachers had become even worse. The parties thus decided that Harry would stay at home indefinitely.
<P>
Harry became increasingly unhappy with the arrangement. He deeply missed teaching and found the role of a full-time parent unfulfilling. While Harry was considering his options, he received devastating news. Sally has been having an affair with her accountant and has just announced to Harry that she wants to end the marriage. Sally proposes that they have joint custody of the children, that they agree that they will live within three miles of each other and that she will support Harry for one year while he either upgrades his qualifications, or finds a job teaching, or otherwise. Sally is now a high school principal, earning $82,000. The parties have a matrimonial home worth $250,000 which they jointly own. The car is registered in Robert's name. Sally's pension with the Board of Education has not as yet been valued, but is becoming substantial, given her years of experience.
<P>
Harry has come to see you for advice. He wants to know what to do about all this. He accepts that the marriage is over. He can accept Sally's suggestions for the children's custody arrangements, but he thinks Sally should support him indefinitely and that she should fully support the children. He asks you to explain the law in these two areas to him, with references to the case law and statutes you think applicable. Because he likes to think about these matters carefully, he would like your opinion in writing, but he can't afford a lot of your time so he asks that you spend
no more than 45 minutes drafting your opinion. Please do so.

<h3>QUESTION ONE (60 marks)</h3>

Health Foods Ltd. (&quot;HF&quot;) is a widely held company which is incorporated under the <cite>Ontario Business Corporations Act </cite>(OBCA) and which offers its class &quot;A&quot; voting shares for sale to residents of Ontario. Over the years, while selling its many natural food products to eager consumers, it has developed a reputation for its environmental sensitivity and for its involvement in aiding Third World development. In April 1993, however, it discovered, quite by accident, a very promising process for the development of a new chemical fertilizer which has since come to be called Gro-Fast. While Gro-Fast is very good for increasing crop yields in the Third World, its use there (or anywhere) is thought to be environmentally problematic. It was always clear that development of the new fertilizer would be very lucrative in the short run for HF, but the company directors and officers within HF became somewhat divided over whether it was good for HF in the long run to develop the new product and, possibly, to jeopardize HF's excellent environmental reputation.
<P>
All the furor began to attract the attention of Chem Life Inc. (&quot;CL&quot;), another widely held OBCA company. CL was interested in what Gro-Fast would do for its local suburban fertilizer business, and had no qualms at all about its possible environmental effects. Thus, the rumour began to develop that CL wanted to buy control of HF in order to acquire the rights to this lucrative new fertilizer.
<P>
In the face of these various developments, and the seeming inability of the directors and officers of HF to decide what to do, Green, who has been a 10% shareholder in HF since June 1993, requested the directors of HF to call a special shareholder meeting. She wanted the shareholders to consider her proposal that there be no development of Gro-Fast because to do so would &quot;seriously tarnish the fine reputation which HF has developed within the
international community of Third World environmentalists&quot; and &quot;set back, by at least a decade, the development of environmental consciousness where it is most needed, viz., in some of the globe's most precious and unspoiled eco-systems.&quot; Her proposal argued further that it would be wrong, and not in the best interest of
HF even to register and own the patent on Gro-Fast, let alone for the company to develop and market it, since to do so would discourage those ethically motivated investors, like herself, who had so long been specially attracted to  HF.
<P>
Initially, the directors of HF refused to circulate Green's proposal, but on hearing in January 1994 that CL had  accquired 15% of the class &quot;A&quot; voting shares in HF and had plans to acquire an even larger stake, these same directors decided to call a special  meeting of shareholders and to circulate Green's proposal with the management information circular. In addition, the HF directors proposed to shareholders that they ratify the adoption of a shareholder rights plan to help HF resist any possible takeover. The management information circular made no mention of the fact that CL had already acquired a 15% stake. This rights plan would allow HF  shareholders, should any one shareholder acquire 20% of its shares, to exchange any one of their class &quot;A&quot; voting shares for a new class &quot;B&quot; non-voting share plus a per share premium, while
still retaining the right to share in any takeover premium should a successful 50% takeover occur. This rights plan was not to be available to any 20% or over shareholder, and was to be (cheaply) redeemable by HF at the discretion of its board of directors.
<P>
At the shareholder meeting, both Green's proposal and the shareholder rights plan were approved by around 70% of the shares voted, half of which were voted by proxies held by the officers and directors. Two days after the shareholder meeting, when the market price of HF's class &quot;A&quot; shares was $20, CL launched its takeover
bid, seeking a 50% stake in the class &quot;A&quot; shares of HF at a price of $30 per share and promising to take up all remaining shares on demand in exchange for unsecured debt. However, almost no HF class &quot;A&quot; shareholders tendered into the bid.
<P>
Given the guidance they received at this shareholder meeting, the directors and officers of HF decided neither to register the patent on, nor to develop and market, the Gro-Fast fertilizer product. However, it has now come to light that a very similar product was subsequently patented and developed at Wealth Foods Inc. (&quot;WF&quot;), another OBCA company, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of All Foods Inc. (&quot;AF&quot;). AF, also
an OBCA company, has long held a 15% stake in HF and is wholly owned by Green, the 10% shareholder in HF. Moreover, Van Gorkum, one of the five directors on HF's board, is also on the ten member board of AF. Van Gorkum did disclose at the HF's director's meeting that to her knowledge WF was also developing a patentable product very like Gro-Fast, but she did not reveal that Green was the sole shareholder of AF. While Van Gorkum did vote on the Gro-Fast decision at the HF directors' meeting, her vote was not decisive for the result since the three other directors present (four of the five directors needed to be present to satisfy the board's quorum rule), being &quot;committed environmentalists&quot;, all voted that HF should not patent or develop Gro-Fast.
<P>
Nevertheless, Johnny Cash, who is one of the many small shareholders in HF and who, like them, invested in HF largely in ignorance of its reputation for being an environmentally friendly company, feels that there is something gone amiss. He is concerned that Gro-Fast looked to be a promising and profitable product for HF and that, somehow, an opportunity to participate either in those profits or in a lucrative takeover has been missed. He has come to you for advice as to what remedies might be available to him. Advise him.
<P><br>
<h3>QUESTION TWO (40 marks)</h3>

&quot;The study of corporations and corporate law is a good general introduction to an understanding of what can be problematic in,  and helpful for, the actual workings of a broad range of different institutions. Whether it be the collective action problems we observe in voting or market contracting, or the strategic difficulties which are involved in the litigation decision, or in the information requirements for an appropriate adjudicative response to the most complex forms of that litigation in cases, say, of fiduciary breach, the study of corporations and corporate law is replete  with systematic examples of both institutional pathology and of how institutions can be shaped to deal effectively with worst case scenarios.&quot;
<P>
Comment on the merits of the above claim, illustrating your points of agreement and/or disagreement with specific examples taken from the course. If you think that the study of corporations and corporate law provides an unbalanced or distorted account of how public institutions should properly frame problems and their solution, you should specify why you think that this is so and what special dimensions are missing from corporate analysis. On the other hand, if you think that the study of corporations and corporate law provides good general guidance for lessons on appropriate institutional design beyond the for-profit corporation, you should speculate a little on what some of those more general applications of the corporate analysis might look like.

<ol>
<li>There are two questions. The first question is worth 30% of the total mark. The second question is worth 70%.
<P>
<li>You may use any materials you want in answering the questions.
<P>
<li>I place a premium on <b>organization and clarity</b>. Answers which have been well thought out in advance uniformly score higher.
<P>
<li>Feel free to incorporate by reference anything that you say in response to one question for the purpose of answering another question.

<li>Note that &quot;OSA&quot; means the Ontario <cite>Securities Act</cite>. &quot;OSC&quot; means the Ontario Securities Commission.
</ol>
<hr>
<p>
1. Attached (as <a href="#appendix-a">Appendix A</a>) is a copy of an advertisement that recently appeared in the <cite>Financial Post</cite>. You are on staff at the Ontario Securities Commission and have been asked to write a memorandum indicating whether this ad complies with Ontario securities law, and if not, in what respects. Please write the memo.
<P>
2.  Munitions Corp. is a corporation incorporated under the OBCA engaged in the business of manufacturing rifle ammunition. There are 20 shareholders, 8 of whom reside in Ontario. The other 12 reside in 6 different provinces. The Articles of Incorporation allow the directors to refuse to register a transfer of shares belonging to a shareholder indebted to the company. The Articles also forbid any offering of the corporation's securities for sale to the public.
<P>
The directors of Munitions decided that the company needed more money to carry on its activities. The President of Munitions, Ms. Fire, informed the board that she had secured commitments from the following sources:
<P>
i/ her significant other, Jean-Luc. Jean-Luc is an accountant who lives in Quebec City but spends his weekends with Fire at her fashionable home in Toronto. Jean-Luc has agreed to buy $100,000 worth of shares.
<P>
ii/ Smoots, a business partner of a former business partner of Fire, and also Fire's favourite golfing partner (fire plays golf as often as business will allow, usually once a week). Smoots is a person of substantial means. Because Fire likes to blab about business on the golf course, Smoots is generally familiar with the ammunition business. Smoots has also agreed to buy $100,000 worth of shares.
<P>
iii/ a venture capitalist (a firm whose business it is to take equity stakes in relatively small or start-up companies) called Novel Ventures Inc. Novel Ventures funded Smoots's business, and was recommended to Fire by Smoots. Novel Ventures has indicated that they would only be interested in investing under two conditions: first, that they be issued just enough shares so that, after all other contemplated share issuances are made, they will hold exactly 19.99% of the equity of the company (this would involve an investment of a few million dollars); second, that a unanimous shareholder agreement be signed under which they would get the right to replace the managers as they see fit.
<P>
iv/ through a friend, she had secured an introduction to Ronda Wait, an extremely successful business person and one of the wealthiest individuals in Canada. Fire told the board that she had met with Wait and that Wait had indicated a willingness to purchase a secured debenture in Munitions with a face value of $125,000.
<P>
v/ the Royal Bank is willing to lend Munitions $3,000,000, repayable in installments of principal and interest over 5 years.
<P>
vi/ after placing an advertisement in the Journal of Munitions Engineers of Canada, seeking equity investments from engineers, Fire received about 45 responses. After holding a promotional meeting attended by 25 of these engineers, 10 indicated a willingness to purchase shares in the amount of $100,000 (per engineer). For purposes of making the investment, the 10 engineers plan to form an investment corporation that will issue 1 share to each of the engineers, and then Durchase and hold all of the $1.000.000 worth of shares in Munitions.
<P>
<h3>Part 1</h3>

The board of directors would like to proceed to raise capital from all of the above sources. They will only do so, however, if they do not have to prepare a prospectus. They have hired you to figure out if (and how) this is possible. Please advise.
<P>
<h3>Part 2</h3>

What resale restrictions (if any) attach to the securities purchased in Part 1?
<P>
<h3>Part 3</h3>

A year has now passed since the transactions in Part 1. The board of directors of Munitions decided to amend the Articles of Incorporation, to eliminate the provision that allows the directors to refuse to register a transfer of shares belonging to a shareholder indebted to the company.
<P>
i/ Does this trigger any immediate regulatory requirements?
<P>
ii/ Will this action affect the resale restrictions (if any) attaching to the shares purchased in Part 1?
<P>
iii/ Suppose that the company had deleted the above restriction in its Articles prior to raising capital in Part 1.  Indicate in a general way how this would affect your answer to Part 1.
<P>
<h3>Part 4</h3>

Since the above events, Munitions has issued shares under a prospectus (with the shares being offered in Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta) and has been listed on the Montreal Exchange (both of these occurrences took place 6 months ago). The directors of Munitions are concerned that Munitions might be open to a &quot;hostile&quot; takeover
(one consummated without their consent). They have therefore proposed adoption of a &quot;Shareholder Rights Plan&quot; under which &quot;rights&quot; to purchase further shares in Munitions will be issued as a dividend to the common shareholders of Munitions. Each right will enable the holder to purchase a common share in the company at half the market price of the share at the date of exercise. However, the rights will be inactive unless and until any shareholder acquires 20% or more of the common shares of the company. Once that threshold is reached, the rights will become active and can be exercised. Further, until the triggering event occurs, the rights will not be separately tradeable from the associated common shares. When the 20% threshold is crossed, the rights will &quot;separate&quot; from the common shares and will be separately traded.
<P>
You have been retained by Munitions to advise whether or not a prospectus will be required for the issuance of the rights. The Munitions board would also like to know whether, if the rights are exercised for common shares, it will be necessary to prepare a prospectus to issue the common shares. What resale restrictions (if any) will attach to the rights after a triggering event, and to the common shares obtained by exercise of the rights? Supposing that the rights are issued under a prospectus, will this affect the resale restrictions attaching to the common shares received
in exchange? Just for the sake of argument, suppose that the rights were initially issued under s.71(1)(a) of the Act. Would this make a difference to the resale restrictions attaching to the common shares?

When purchasing an ostrich, the owner places the ostrich in livery with the Ostrich Farming Corporation. As part of the purchasing contract the Corporation agree to the stated Chick Allocation, Guaranteed Buy Back Options and like for the replacement in the event of ill health or infertility. As a result the purchase is not a financial investment and therefore is not regulated by the Personal Investment Authority in the U.K. and the associated Investors Compensation scheme.
<P>
In the event of the Corporation being unable to trade, the owner still retains their initial 'asset' in their ostrich(es) and its offspring, which will be placed into livery at a farm that meets the existing natural and humane welfare farming standard laid down by the Ostrich Farming Corporation.

Take-Home Examination<br>
April 1996<br>
Professor MacIntosh</h2></center>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
<li>The exam must be returned within 24 hours of being picked up (unless you have made a special arrangement with Professor MacIntosh).
<P>
<li>You may not use any materials except class materials (i.e. casebooks, notes, etc.) or materials used in connection with the course (e.g. photocopies that you may have made during the course). In other words. this is a takehome exam, and <b>not</b> a research exam.
<P>
<li>In accordance with the Faculty Council resolution of Oct. 6, 1993, you may consult with other students in the course of working out your answer. However, please note that this resolution provides that &quot;the answer or answers returned by the students must be organized and written by that student alone&quot;.
<P>
<li>There are two questions. The marks are allocated as follows:
<blockquote>
Ql: 30%<br>
Q2: 70%
</blockquote>
<li>The word limit for the whole exam is 3500 words. You may allocate your 3500 words in any way you see fit as between the two questions.
<P>
<li>Please make a word estimate for the entire exam and put this estimate on the front page of your exam answer. Anything written in excess of the word limit <b>will not be read!</b> Be forewarned that this penalty will be enforced with absolute strictness, in fairness to those students who make a conscientious effort to observe the word limit. In the past, I have downgraded at least one &quot;A&quot; paper to a &quot;C&quot; for significantly exceeding the word limit, and have downgraded many more a half or a whole grade.
<P>
Please note that all word estimates are carefully checked. Given some complaints about uneven enforcement of the rule in the past, I have decided (commencing this year) to hire a graduate student to carefully check all work estimates. No prisoners will be taken.
<P>
<li>I would prefer that you type your examination answer. However, this is not required. If you write your answer, <b>please</b> make sure that it is legible, and written on <b>every other line.</b> If you choose, you may submit a handwritten copy of your answer and submit a typed copy within one week (or longer if you have made a special arrangement with me).
<P>
If you submit a handwritten copy and intend to replace this with a typewritten copy, <b>please clearly indicate this on the top of the handwritten copy</b>.
<P>
<li>I place a high premium on <b>organization and clarity</b>. Answers which have been well thought out in advance uniformly score higher.

<center><h3>PART I - FACTUM ASSIGNMENT</h3>

(Time allotment - 4 hours of 5 hour exam)</center>
<P>
<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>

On February 10, 1993 Walter Smith and his close friend Jack Jones had spent the day ice fishing and snowmobiling on Lake John in the County of Oz in the province of Ontario. Snow had been falling most of the afternoon. As it began to get dark in late afternoon Walter and Jack decided to head home. Walter was driving his own snowmobile and Jack was a passenger.
<P>
They headed west across Lake John and over a number of fields until they reached Highway 4 which runs  North/South. They headed north along the shoulder at the side of Highway 4. Driving a snowmobile on the side of a highway is legal in the County of Oz. Both the side of the road and the road itself were covered in snow.
<P>
As Walter and Jack travelled along on Highway 4 the snow continued and darkness fell. Walter and Jack hit the side of an NC train which was crossing Highway 4 in an easterly direction.
<P>
Both Jack and Walter survived but suffered numerous injuries. Walter broke both of his legs and cracked his skull. A blood test done on Walter at the hospital indicated that he had alcohol in his blood just below the legal limit. Jack suffered numerous broken bones and endured partial amnesia as well as depression.
<P>
The railway crossing in question had a flashing light mechanism to warn oncoming cars, vehicles, snowmobilers and pedestrians of the train crossing the roadway. It did not have a descending bar to prevent anyone from crossing the track. The train and the flashing light mechanism are owned and operated by the NC Railway Company.
<P>
Walter and Jack sued the NC Railway Company alleging negligence on the basis of the allegation that the flashing light mechanism was not working. Both Walter and Jack claimed damages for lost income and pain and suffering. The NC Railway defended alleging that the flashing light mechanism was working properly and that Jack and Walter had no one to blame but themselves since they had failed to see the flashing light. They also alleged that Jack was drunk.
<P>
<h3>Evidence at Trial</h3>
<P>
The significant evidence at trial was as follows:
<P>
1. Walter Smith
<P>
Walter Smith testified that as he drove north on the side of Highway 4, visibility was poor, but that he could see approximately 50 feet in front of him. He said he was driving his snowmobile at approximately 50 kilometers per hour (the speed limit was 60 kilometers per hour). He testified that he had had a couple of beers with lunch out on the lake. He stated that as he approached the railway crossing the railway flashing light mechanism was not flashing
and that he didn't know what he had hit when he hit the side of the train.
<P>
2. Jack Jones
<P>
Jack testified that he and Walter had enjoyed a great day snowmobiling and that lunch had included approximately 5 beers apiece. He indicated that he couldn't see a thing as they drove back on Highway 4 because the snow was so bad. Beyond that he had no memory of the accident and couldn't say whether the railway light mechanism had been flashing or not.
<P>
3. Frank McLaughlin
<P>
Frank testified that on February 10, 1993 he made his way home from work travelling in a northerly direction on Highway 4. He testified he was driving approximately 30 kilometers per hour as he approached the railway crossing which he knew well. He had driven that route on a daily basis for 5 years and he said that his practice was to look for the train itself rather than to look for the flashing lights. He testified that although visibility was poor, he saw the train crossing the road and that he stopped his car for that reason. He testified as well that although it was the sight of the train that made him stop, he was sure that the lights were flashing as well.
<P>
He had been sitting in his car facing north waiting for the train to pass when Walter and Jack had passed him on the side of the road to his right and hit the train. McLaughlin used his car phone to call for help and the police and ambulance soon arrived to take both Walter and Jack to c nearby hospital.
<P>
He also admitted that some ten years earlier he had been convicted of fraud in connection with stolen funds from his employer. He had gone to jail for five years but had been &quot;crime free&quot; ever since.
<P>
4. Police Constable Mary McKinnon
<P>
Officer McKinnon testified that she arrived on the scene some ten minutes after the collision. She testified that she was an expert in accident reconstruction and that on examining the scene she noticed that the snowmobile tracks heading in a northerly direction caused by Walter's snowmobile veered sharply to the right just south of the flashing light mechanism. It was her opinion that this was consistent with the driver of the snowmobile having seen the flashing light and having tried to veer to the right to avoid the train.
<P>
5. Katherine Johnson
<P>
She testified that she was an engineer who specialized in train derailments and accidents and who had been retained by the NC train company as an expert witness in this case. She testified that she had examined the flashing light mechanism from the scene of the accident. She testified that when she tested it, it operated correctly 99 times out of 100 but that one time out of 100 it failed to operate correctly.
<P>
6. Other Evidence At Trial
<P>
It was accepted by all parties that separate and apart from the issue of who was liable for the damages, the lost wages for Walter Smith were $200,000 and that his general damages for pain and suffering were $100,000. The lost wages for Jack Jones were $150,000 and his general damages were $125,000.
<P>
<h3>Reasons For Judgment of the Honourable Sandra James</h3>

(The case was tried by a judge without a jury)
<P>
An accident occurred on February 10, 1993 when Walter Smith who was driving his snowmobile, with his passenger Jack Jones accompanying him, collided with an eastbound NC train at an intersection with Highway 4. Mr. Smith and Jones allege negligence against the NC train company. The case comes down to whether or not the flashing light mechanism was working. There seems to be evidence on both sides of the issue. On the one hand Walter Smith testifies that the mechanism was not flashing. On the other hand Frank McLaughlin testified that he was certain that he saw the flashing light and that he himself had stopped his own car. I accept, without hesitation,
the evidence of Walter Smith that the light was not flashing. I saw his demeanor in the witness box and I found him to be an honest and straightforward witness. I see no reason why he would say the light was not flashing if it was. Presumably if the light had been flashing he would have stopped.
<P>
I reject the testimony of Frank McLaughlin for two reasons. First, the man is a convicted fraud artist and really can't be believed. Second, I don't see how he could see anything if it was snowing as hard as everyone says it was.
<P>
With respect to the evidence of Constable Mary McKinnon, she was not an eyewitness but rather was someone who came on the scene afterwards. I thought her testimony regarding the tracks in the snow was interesting but of doubtful assistance.
<P>
The testimony of Katherine Johnston seems to help Smith and Jones rather than hurt them. She testified that the mechanism was faulty and that although it worked properly 99% of the time, 1% of the time it did not work properly. It must have been the case in my view that the accident on February 10,1993 was one of the those
&quot;1%&quot; occasions.
<P>
There was an issue raised about contributory negligence. NC Railway argued that even if the mechanism was not working, Smith and Jones had been drinking an excessive amount that day and that it likely impaired their judgment and in particular the judgment of Walter Smith, the driver of the snowmobile. I tend to agree with this argument and I find that Walter Smith was 30% liable for the accident with NC Railway Company 70% liable. In the end, I award the full amount of the damages claimed by Walter Smith and Jack Jones. Mr. Smith shall receive $300,000 plus costs and Mr. Jones shall receive $275,000 plus costs.
<P>
<h3>Work Assignment</h3>
<P>
You are retained by the NC Railway Company to appeal this judgment on its behalf. It is necessary for you to draft a factum which will contain the following sections:
<blockquote>
 i) facts;
<P>
ii) issues;
<P>
iii) law;
<P>
iv) order requested.
</blockquote>
You do not need to do independent research outside of the course materials.
<P><br>
<center><h3>PART II - SHORT ANSWER ASSIGNMENT</h3>
<P>
(45 minutes to one hour)</center>
<P>
<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<P>
You are approached by Norm Numberhead who is a professional bookkeeper. He is charged by the Bookkeepers Society of Ontario under <cite>The Bookkeepers Society Act </cite>with professional misconduct. (You can assume that this society exists and that there is indeed such a statute. All you know about that society and all you know about that statute is provided for in this question). It is alleged that Norm Numberhead is guilty of professional misconduct by reason of alleged negligence in connection with bookkeeping which he did for various clients from 1985 to 1987. Negligent bookkeeping is grounds for a finding of professional misconduct under <cite>The Bookkeepers Society Act. </cite>The notice charging Norm Numberhead with the offenses is dated November 1, 1995 and calls for a hearing to take place on April 30, 1996. Norm can't even remember the clients he is alleged to have failed to serve during 1985 to 1987.
<P>
Norm will be judged by a panel of his peers. The Chair of the panel is a fellow bookkeeper with whom Norm used to work with and who once called Norm a &quot;thief&quot;. <cite>The Bookkeepers Society Act </cite>provides for a full hearing for charges of professional misconduct including rights to cross-examination, right to counsel
and the right to be advised of the full details of the charges against him. Norm Numberhead is assured by the Bookkeepers Society that he will have all of these rights in compliance with all of the provisions. There is also a full appeal provided for in <cite>The Bookkeepers Society Act </cite>which allows for an appeal to the Divisional Court after the hearing.
<P>
<h3>Work Assignment</h3>

Norm Numberhead comes to you and asks you a number of questions. You are obliged to give him an answer which is no longer than 2 to 3 pages (double spaced).
<blockquote>
Norm doesn't want to go to a hearing and wants to stop it ahead of time. If you tried to stop the hearing ahead of time what type of remedy would you ask for, on what grounds, and what type of proceeding would you commence? What type of considerations would be involved in determining whether or not you would be successful in the proceeding?

1. Fifteen months ago, Clifford received a flu shot vaccine at the Flavelle General. The vaccine was made by NoCold Inc., a maker of vaccines which is in financial trouble. It still sells vaccines, but it no longer answers the telephone or the door at its place of business.
<P>
Clifford has suffered chronic fatigue symptoms for the past ten months. Until recently he went to a holistic medical specialist without formal training who told him the symptoms were related to his lifestyle. Last month, he saw a medical doctor who told him he may be part of a small group of people who are allergic to the flu shot and as a result develop chronic fatigue symptoms. The doctor mentioned, however, that in most cases the symptoms appear within weeks of the final shot.
<P>
Under Ontario law, hospitals now can only administer flu shots approved by regulation and those manufactured by NoCold Inc. had been so approved. Both NoCold and Flavelle General will rely upon this approval. Clifford has heard rumours that when the government passed regulations approving the NoCold shot, it ignored some evidence that the shot would produce fatigue symptoms in some people. The government refuses to comment on these rumours and refuses to discuss the matter with Clifford or reporters.
<P>
The government's regulation approving the NoCold shot was issued under the <cite>Vaccine Approval Law</cite> which requires that the government consider the health risks to all Ontarians before approving vaccines. The <cite>Vaccine Approval Law</cite> also requires that no civil action with respect to the administration of a vaccine shall be brought one year after the cause of action accrues.
<P>
Clifford is not the only person who has experienced problems with the vaccine. Frank brought civil proceedings against NoCold three years ago, but was unsuccessful. Two years ago, Jane brought civil proceedings against NoCold and the judge found, after a lengthy and expensive trial, that NoCold was negligent because it ought to have known the risks that the vaccine could cause these symptoms in some people. At the time of the negligence, the <cite>Vaccine Approval Law</cite> had not been passed. It appears that no one else is willing to take action. Clifford knows this because he is member of a province wide group of 200 people who have similar symptoms
after receiving flu shots.
<P>
Clifford believes that the vaccine is a pressing public problem and wants to take the most expeditious, effective and least expensive proceedings to stop the administration of these flu shots. He is especially concerned about the cost of litigation.
<P>
Write a memorandum outlining the litigation options for Clifford's case including any procedural obstacles and/or shortcuts that he may face. Indicate which procedural options will best serve his objectives.
<P><br>
2. You are a junior lawyer in the legal department of Toys Inc., a large toy company headquartered in Toronto. Your boss has given you a statement of claim in which Sam, a 16 year old boy, is alleging that Toys Inc. negligently built the Tankmaster, your company's most successful product. Sam received a serious eye injury when he was 9 years old when a moving part came off the Tankmaster. He claims $1 million in damages. Sue is Sam's mother. She has also joined in the action to claim $200,000 under Ontario's <cite>Family Law Act</cite> for the loss of Sam's companionship.
<P>
Sam and Sue have recently served the statement of claim in Ontario, but they have just moved to Manitoba. They are not well off and their lawyer is in the first year of his practice, coincidentally after having articled for a Toronto firm that Toys Inc. has on retainer. Before they commenced the litigation, Sam and Sue held a news conference denouncing Toys Inc. as a corporate giant hungry for profits that wilfully places the safety of little children in jeopardy.
<P>
Toys Inc. has received several complaints about this moving part on the Tankmaster. A number of these complaints threatened to bring action against Toys Inc. while others threatened to report the company to various governmental departments in charge of product safety. Last year, you were put in charge of an internal investigation of the safety of the Tankmaster and you have a file with all the complaints, as well as memorandum addressed to you from the company's head toymaker and a consultant not employed by Toys Inc. who both say that the moving part is liable to detach. You also have an estimate from another outside consultant that the entire Tankmaster would have to be re-engineered at a substantial cost if the moving part was eliminated.
<P>
Write a memorandum outlining issues that will arise in the preparation of the statement of defence and affidavit of documents. You should also consider what, if any, pre-trial motions should be brought, whether defamation actions against Sam and Sue can be joined to the action, the strategy and effects of settlement offers and any ethical considerations which may arise in the defence.
<P><br>
Answer <b>one</b> of the following <b>two</b> questions
<P>
3a) Procedural fairness requires that plaintiffs and defendants and all classes of litigants be treated the same. It is not possible or desirable to tailor procedural rules on the basis of the effects that they might have on different litigants.
<P>
With reference to specific examples, assess the accuracy and the wisdom of the above statement.
<P>
3b) The adversarial system of civil litigation following prolonged discovery and culminating in a full oral trial is a luxury that litigants can no longer afford.
<P>
With reference to specific examples, assess the accuracy and wisdom of the above statement.

<h2>Civil Procedure<br>
April 1996<br>
Allan C. Hutchinson</h2></center>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Students are to answer THREE questions: all questions carry equal marks.
<P>
<li>There is to be no <b>substantial</b> overlap between the answers.
<P>
<li>This is an open book examination.
<P>
<li>Be legible and organised.
</ol>
<hr>
<P>
<h3>QUESTION ONE</h3>

1. You are invited to take part in a symposium on &quot;The Rise and Rise of A.D.R.&quot;, organised jointly by the law school and the law society. You are specifically asked to contribute a short paper on the implications and changes that might be required to traditional understandings of legal ethics when lawyers become more actively involved in A.D.R. The invitation also recommends that you situate your remarks in a practical context and use concrete examples to illustrate your argument.
<P>
<center><h3>What would you write?</h3></center>
<p><br>
<h3>QUESTION TWO</h3>

2. You have been appointed to the Supreme Court of Utoro, the highest court in Canada. Several cases are slated for appeal. <b>Select <i>two</i> of the following cases and write the judgment that you would give:</b>
<blockquote>
(A) <cite>Phillips</cite> (Casebook p.220);
<P>
(B) <cite>Memphis Rogues</cite> (Casebook p.781);
<P>
(C ) <cite>Palmer</cite> (Casebook p.619); and
<P>
(D) <cite>Brett</cite> (Casebook p.608).
</blockquote>
<p><br>
<h3>QUESTION THREE</h3>

3. A Canadian Airlines plane has crashed in Northern Ontario near the town of Cochrane. A substantial part of the population is evacuated for a few days in order to facilitate rescue attempts and to guard against further explosions. Many lawsuits are commenced for different claims (negligence, nuisance, contract, etc), in different courts (Small Claims, General Division, etc.), for different amounts (from $1000 for lost profits to $5m for loss of life), and against different defendants (Canadian Airlines, the plane manufacturers, the Town, etc.).
<P>
Harry brings an action for $10,000 for damage to his house against Canadian Airlines, the plane manufacturers, and the Town. At trial, he is successful against Canadian Airlines who entered only a cursory defence to his claim; the action against the other defendants is dismissed. A few days later, a public inquiry by the Canadian Aviation Authority, mandated by the relevant legislation, determines that the accident was not the fault of the pilot or the airline.
<P>
Madeleine's action for $5m for the death of her husband against Canadian Airlines, the plane manufacturers, and the Town comes to trial. She pleads issue estoppel as to the liability of Canadian Airlines. Also, the plane manufacturers and the Town want to rely on issue estoppel against Madeleine.
<P>
The case comes before you as a judge.
<P>
<center><h3>What would you decide?</h3></center>
<P><br>
<h3>QUESTION FOUR</h3>

4. A few days after the crash of the Canadian Airlines plane (see question 3), you are approached by several groups of people -- townspeople, survivors, families of victims, etc. They want to know whether they should bring a class action. As well as the prospects of bringing such an action, they are particularly interested in the advantages and disadvantages that this would have over a more traditional set of multiple claims.
<P>
<center><h3>What would you advise them?</h3></center>
<P><br>
<H3>QUESTION FIVE</h3>

5. In the last year, Jaswan, a farmer, has become very ill. He attributes this to using a crop herbicide, manufactured by and distributed by Kill Products. He has used the herbicide for the last 10 years. In his recent statement of claim, after outlining the nature of his injuries, Jaswan simply claims that &quot;the plaintiff says that his illness was caused by the gross negligence of the defendant in the manufacture, sale and marketing of the pesticide.&quot; As a judge, you are confronted by the following motions:
<P>
(A) the defendants did not plead, but moved for particulars of the negligence. The plaintiff argues that he has no reliable information to particularize his assertion that is not already in the possession of the defendant.
<P>
(B) [assume that an order for particulars was not made and the action proceeded to discovery] the plaintiff asked the defendant, who refused, to produce various pieces of information. These included the existence of other claims relating to the herbicide; how such claims were resolved; a report prepared in 1992 by independent experts on the toxicity of the pesticide; and the sales volume of the herbicide.
<P>
(C) At the trial and after two days of its submissions, the defendant raised for the first time the argument that Jaswan was a known smoker and drug-user and that his illness is consistent with such usage.
<P>
<center><h3>How would you dispose of these matters?</h3></center>
<P><br>
<h3>QUESTION SIX</h3>

6. You are approached by a latter-day Mrs. Donoghue (of <cite>Donoghue v. Stevenson</cite> fame). You estimate that she has a claim for about $20,000 in damages and that she has about a 50/50 chance of succeeding against one of either the cafe-owner, the retailer or the manufacturer of the ginger beer. She has received a joint letter from them stating that they will settle for a combined total of $5000. She asks your advise about a number of matters:
<blockquote>
(A) whether such a settlement should be accepted;
<P>
(B) what are the economic implications of pursuing litigation to trial;
<P>
(C) whether she should make any counter-offer and how to do that;
<P>
(D) what financial arrangements can be made between you and her (who has no savings) about financing the litigation;
<P>
(E) whether she might be eligible for any state-support; and
<P>
(F) why it is so difficult to bring such actions.
</blockquote>
<center><h3>What would you advise?</h3></center>
<P><br>
<h3>QUESTION SEVEN</h3>

7. <b>Devise, state and answer your own question.</b>

April 1996<br>
Take-Home Examination</h2></center>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<blockquote>
The Faculty of Law take-home exam policy states, in part: &quot;It is expected that there will be consultation
amongst students writing the same take home examination, although the answer or answers returned by the student must be organized and written by that student alone&quot;.
<P>
Students should pay particular attention to the need for a take home answer to be their own work. It must be &quot;organized and written by that student alone&quot;. Contravening this rule is an academic offence under the University's Code of Academic Conduct. You may refer to any materials you wish.
<P>
The examination answer is to be submitted within 48 hours of the time of pick-up. It may be returned to the Records office or faxed to the instructor at (416) 978-7899 or e-mailed to the instructor at rhowse@law.utoronto.ca. <B>In all cases, students should retain a hard copy of their examination answer. </B>The answer should not exceed 14 double-spaced, typed pages.

<hr>
<P>
<B>Please answer all parts of the following question.</B>
<P>
Nordland is a federal country the laws of which, except as otherwise specified, are identical in all respects to those of Canada. Yesterday by less than a 1% majority, the people of Laurentia, a province in Nordland, voted to separate from Nordland and form a separate state. Immediately following the vote the leader of the Laurentian separatists, Gaston Foulard, announced that any move towards separation would be delayed by one year to give &quot;the rest of Nordland&quot; one last chance to negotiate an agreement that would address Laurentia's grievances and thereby avoid the necessity of separation.
<P>
You are an articling student in the legal department of the Prime Minister's Office. The Prime Minister requires a briefing on the legal implications of certain aspects of the referendum result and related actions or proposed actions of various governments. You have been asked by the Prime Minister's Principal Secretary to draft the portion of the briefing that deals with Conflict of Laws.
<ol>
<li>Because the vote was so close, the Prime Minister is considering the extent to which is should be accepted as the clear democratic will of the people of Laurentia. One matter that troubles the Prime Minister is that the right to vote in the referendum was determined not on the basis of residency but of &quot;domicile&quot;. Foulard had commented when asked by federal officials to explain this concept, &quot;you should know what it means, it comes from your British common law.&quot; The Prime Minister is interested to know whether: 1) use of this concept would allow individuals to vote who are not normally resident in the province of Laurentia; 2) if it would have, in
effect, prohibited from voting substantial numbers of residents of Laurentia, particularly newer residents, including recently arrived immigrants from other countries; 3)since there are concerns about bias in the administration of the vote, whether it would have allowed elections officers and poll clerks a large margin of discretion, in effect, to determine who could validly vote.
<P>
<li>Following the vote, public anger in certain other provinces of Nordland led the governments of those provinces to announce that the government of Laurentia and any entity owned or controlled by the government, including its enormous Pension Development Bank, would be barred from trading of securities on the markets of those provinces. Before stating publicly his response to these moves, the Prime Minister wishes to be briefed on the legality of such actions under conflicts and related constitutional principles.
<P>
<li>After a series of virulent attacks on the Laurentia separatist movement as &quot;racists&quot; and &quot;linguistic Nazis&quot; in newspapers and on radio talk shows in other provinces of Nordland that occurred during the referendum campaign, Foulard has announced his government will enact a law creating a civil right of action against anyone in Nordland who &quot;falsely dishonours&quot; the Laurentia people. The draft law explicitly states that this and other laws of Laurentia will apply, regardless of the place in Nordland where
the alleged dishonouring act occurred, and that the courts of Laurentia shall have jurisdiction over any defendant against which damages are claimed on the basis of the &quot;falsely dishonouring&quot; provision, whether or not resident in or engaged in business in Laurentia. Before reacting to these proposed moves, the Prime Minister wishes
to be briefed on the conflicts and related constitutional law issues to which they give rise. <B>Please note however that the question of whether these measures could withstand a constitutional challenge under the freedom of expression provisions of the Charter is the subject of a briefing note by someone else, and should not be dealt with in your answer except in relation to the application of common law principles.</B>
<P>
<li>The Prime Minister's Office has obtained a copy of a secret plan by Foulard and his movement to disrupt the markets in Nordland's currency in the following year, during which Laurentia is giving Nordland a &quot;last chance&quot; at a negotiated settlement. The Prime Minister is considering legislation that would prohibit the government of any province of Nordland or any entity of a province from engaging in the purchase and sale of Nordland currency beyond a certain amount, including on currency markets outside Nordland without the permission of the federal Government of Nordland. Any contracts for purchase or sale of Nordland currency entered into in violation of this provision would be declared null, void, and unenforceable in Nordland or elsewhere. The Prime Minister wishes to know whether these provisions would be recognized by courts or other bodies outside Nordland.

Professors Rogerson and Swinton</h2></center>
<h3>Note:</h3>
<ol>
<li>You may use any kind of material you wish during the examination, for example, notes, the casebook, and texts, except books owned by the library.
<P>
<li>The exam is composed of four questions. They are not of equal value. Question 1 is worth 35 marks; question 2 is worth 15 marks; and questions 3 and 4 are each worth 25 marks. A suggested time allocation is noted in the margin beside each question.
<P>
<li>Question 1 will be graded by Professor Rogerson and the remainder of the questions by Professor Swinton. <B>Please put your answer to question 1 in a separate booklet (or booklets) and clearly label it.</B>
<P>
<li>Before you begin, ensure that you have written your pseudonym, course name, and the number of the booklet on <b>each</b> examination booklet and the name of the instructor on the <b>first</b> booklet. If you request an additional booklet(s) during the examination, write the required information on the booklet at the time you receive it. No time will be permitted for this at the end of the examination.
<P>
<li>During the examination, only one student at a time is permitted to leave the examination room. No student may leave within fifteen minutes of the conclusion of the examination.
<P>
<li>At the end of this examination, the invigilator will ask you to stop writing, count the total number of booklets used, record this on the front of the first booklet, and insert all booklets into the first booklet. You will then gather your belongings and leave the examination room. <B>All examination answer booklets are to be left on the writing table and will be collected by the invigilator.</B>
<P>
<li>Time limits will be strictly enforced. Students who continue to write after the examination has ended will have their answer booklets collected separately and may be subject to a penalty.

<P>
<b>1. (35 marks; 60 minutes)</b> Quebec's <cite>Charter of the French Language</cite>, intended to promote the use of the French language in the province, has a provision (s.65) requiring that all pre-packaged products offered for sale within the province be labelled both in French and English. Penalties for non-conformity with s. 65 include confiscation of the inadequately labelled products and fines.
<P>
Prior to and during the recent eight day Jewish holiday of Passover, many foodstores in Montreal with a large Jewish clientele imported and offered for sale a variety of kosher Passover foods. (Orthodox Jews follow a strict set of dietary laws. Kosher&quot; refers to foods certified as having been prepared in conformity with Jewish dietary laws under the supervision of a rabbi or other designated person. Foods certified as Kosher for Passover conform with the additional requirement of Jewish law that no food containing leavening agents be eaten during the eight-day Passover period. Kosher Passover foods include not only foods required for Passover observance such as matzah (an unleavened bread), but also a wide array of every-day food products such as orange juice, condiments,
and canned and packaged foods.) Almost all of the kosher Passover foods offered for sale in Montreal stores were imported from New York and bore labels only in English or English and Hebrew. Kosher food manufacturers in the U.S. have explored the possibility of producing special runs of Passover items with French labels, but have concluded that this is impractical and prohibitively expensive, particularly with respect to perishable food products, given the relatively small market in Quebec. For example, one day's run of soup with bilingual labels would yield a six-year supply. While it would be possible for the importers of the Passover products to create special French labels to be attached to the products, they have also concluded that this is too costly and would make the price of the products prohibitive.
<P>
Responding to some complaints about the English-only labels, the Language Office which administers and enforces the language law ordered several stores to remove the Passover foods from their shelves. The stores were warned that if they did not comply, the products would be confiscated and charges laid under the language law.
<P>
There is also federal legislation governing the labelling of products. The <cite>Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act</cite> governs the labelling of all pre-packaged products sold in, imported into or advertised for sale in Canada. Section 4 of the Act prohibits such sale, importation or advertisement unless the product bears a label declaring the net quantity of the product in terms of either numerical count or a prescribed unit of measurement. Section 7  prohibits labels containing false or misleading representations about the product. Section 10 requires that labels show such information respecting the nature, contents and geographic origin of the product as may be prescribed by regulation. Section 20 of the Act creates an offence for violation of the Act and specifies penalties in the form of imprisonment or fines.
<P>
Section 18(1) permits the Governor in Council to make detailed regulations with regard to label form and content, including regulations prescribing &quot;the language or languages in which any information required to be declared
or shown on labels shall be declared or shown.&quot; Pursuant to that section, regulations were passed, setting out in detail the contents and form of labels. Included was Regulation 6(2), titled &quot:Bilingualism Requirements&quot;, which requires that &quot;All information required by the Act and these Regulations to be shown on the label of a pre-packaged product shall be shown in both official languages .&quot; However, the federal regulations permit the Minister to grant exemptions from the labelling requirements in cases involving what are termed &quot;specialty products&quot;. The importers of kosher Passover foods have always applied for and been granted exemptions from the bilingualism regulations before bringing the products into the country.
<P>
A Jewish organization in Montreal wants help in untangling the federal and provincial laws applicable to the importation of kosher food for Passover. In particular, the organization wants some legal assurance that the Jewish community will not have difficulty obtaining these foods in the future. You are a junior lawyer in the law firm that the organization has approached for legal advice. You are to write a memorandum of law on the federalism aspects of this problem. In your memo, set out the arguments which might be used on behalf of this client and assess the prospects of success. Do <b>not </b>deal with issues of standing or <cite> Charter</cite> issues.
<P><br>
<b>2. (15 marks; 30 minutes)</b> This question uses the same fact situation as in Question One. Your next task is to assess the likelihood of a successful <B>Charter</B> challenge to the language law's application under s. 2(a). Consider the strengths and weaknesses of the Charter arguments that the applicants might make for relief from the law. Once again, do not discuss standing.
<P><br>
<b>3. (25 marks; 45 minutes)</b> Proclaiming the values of preserving family bonds and discouraging promiscuity among young people, the provincial government has enacted new legislation about dissemination of birth control information and devices.
<p>
First, any health professional (for example, a doctor or nurse) must notify the parents or legal guardians of any person under the age of 16 who seeks birth control advice or devices for birth control (for example, insertion
of an intra-uterine device or IUD or a prescription for birth control pills). A medical professional who violates this requirement is subject to professional discipline by the appropriate regulatory body.
<P>
Second, birth control devices, including condoms, cannot be sold to or provided by any source to a person under 16 years of age without a prescription from a doctor. Those who violate this requirement are subject to substantial  fines.
<P>
This legislation has been challenged as an unjustifiable violation of sections 2(b) and 7 of the Charter by groups representing young people and by medical professionals; it has been defended by the government and by groups representing parents. What arguments can reasonably be made with respect to these provisions of the Charter (and, of course, s. 1), and what result do you think the courts would reach?
<P><br>
<b>4. (25 marks; 45 minutes)</b> Ann and Beth are a lesbian couple who have lived together for five years now. They share a mortgage on their home and pool their finances. Ann has a six year old daughter, Chelsea, from an earlier relationship, which ended with the death of her partner.
<P>
Chelsea lives with them, and calls both Ann and Beth &quot;Mother&quot;. They have a warm and loving family arrangement, but the adults sometimes worry about what would happen to Chelsea, should Ann die or become incapacitated. They would like to have Beth adopt Chelsea, and thus become her legal parent.
<P>
Currently, the <cite>Adoption Act</cite> provides for so called &quot;family adoptions&quot;. In most adoptions, the ties between a child and his or her former parents are severed and a new parent-child relationship is created. With a family adoption, a child can be adopted by the spouse of his or her parent, with the approval of a Family
Court judge, and the ties with the parent continue. &quot;Spouse&quot; is defined as the person to whom the parent of the child is married or is a person of the opposite sex with whom that person has been living in a relationship represented as that of husband and wife.
<P>
Ann and Beth have come to you for legal advice about the possibility of challenging the constitutionality of the adoption rules under the <cite>Charter of Rights. </cite>They cannot understand why they fail to qualify under the <cite>Adoption Act</cite>, whose purpose they understand to be the provision of a stable family situation for a child.
<P>
They have drawn to your attention extensive information about the ability of gay and lesbian couples to parent: many studies indicate that the most important element in the healthy development of a child is a stable, consistent,
warm, and responsive relationship between a child and his/her caregiver; other studies conclude that there is no evidence that children raised by homosexual parents are likely to be significantly different from children raised by heterosexual parents in all areas of psychological development.
<P>
Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the case that Ann and Beth might make under s. 15 of the Charter, including the appropriate remedy that a Court might give.

<P>
<h3>Question One</h3>

At present, Ontario Hydro, a publicly owned corporation, does virtually all of the production and distribution of electricity in Ontario. There has, though, been lots of talk about &quot;privatization lately. For the purposes of this question, assume that this talk became a reality a few months ago. That is, assume that the production and sale of electricity are now functions for private enterprise. In this new world, the production is done by a few large  corporations (who purchased the existing generating plants from Hydro). Some of the selling is done by these producers, as direct sales to large consumers, but most selling is done by businesses, large and small. that buy electricity from the producers and resell it to consumers. (The distribution network is still publicly owned, but this fact is not significant for this question.)
<P>
The government has made a set of regulations about advertising for sales of electricity, including these two rules:
<blockquote>
i) The total expenditures on advertising by any seller cannot exceed 10% of its total sales in the past year. (There are transitional provisions for new entrants that don't matter here.) This rule was a response to a strong, widespread fear, expressed during the debates about privatization, that competition among sellers would lead to waste, especially wasteful advertising.
<P>
ii) The advertising may not include persuasion to increase the use of energy generally. Instead it must be about the virtues of electricity contrasted to other forms of energy, or about the service and price of the particular seller. This rule was also a response to a widespread fear that in competing among themselves, the sellers would encourage wasteful uses of energy, endangering both our supply of energy and our environment.
</blockquote>
Several sellers brought an action claiming that their right to freedom of expression, given by section 2 of the Charter, has been unjustifiably curtailed. What arguments can be made, and what result do you think the Supreme Court will reach?
<P><br>
<h3>Question Two</h3>

Proclaiming the values of preserving family bonds and discouraging promiscuity, the government has enacted legislation about birth control. First, any health professional (for example, a doctor or nurse) must notify the parents of any person aged 16 or less who seeks advice or devices (for example, IUDs, pills, and condoms) for birth control. (There are provisions for situations in which parents are living apart or cannot be found that do not matter here.) Doctors who violate this requirement are subject to professional discipline. Second, birth control literature or  devices cannot be sold from any source to any person aged 16 or less without a prescription from a doctor, and sellers who violate this requirement are subject to substantial fines.
<P>
This legislation has been challenged as an unjustifiable violation of section 7 of the Charter by groups representing young people, and defended by the government and by groups representing parents. What arguments can reasonably be made, and what result do you think the Supreme Court will reach?
<P><br>
<h3>Question Three</h3>

Ann and Beth are a lesbian couple. Ann has a four-year old daughter, Chelsea, from a marriage that preceded this relation. Ann and Beth both want to have Beth adopt Chelsea, as a formal recognition of the loving bonds of parenthood that both feel exist.
<P>
In most adoptions, the ties between a child and his or her former parents are severed and a new parent child-relation is created. The Adoption Act does, though, proved for so-called family adoptions, in which a child is adopted by the spouse of his or her parent and the ties with the parent continue. Ann and Beth have this form of adoption in mind, but spouse is defined (and the details don't matter) in a way that requires the adopting person to be of the opposite sex to the parent.
<P>
Ann and Beth have come to you for advice. In your discussions with them, they have given you about the ability of gay and lesbian couple to parent: many studies suggest that the most important element in the healthy development of a child is a stable, consistent, warm, and responsive relation between a child and his or her caregiver, and that children raised by homosexual couples are not likely to be significantly different from children from children raised
by heterosexual couples.
<P>
They propose to make a claim that their equality rights given by section 15 of the Charter are unjustifiably violated by the Adoption Act. What arguments can reasonably be made, and what result do you think the Supreme Court will reach?

<h3>QUESTION 1</h3>

You are an articling student at a law firm in British Columbia. Your firm is representing an Aboriginal couple, Mr. and Mrs. Ryan, who belong to the Gitksan nation. They live in Smithers, B.C., a large town in the interior of British Columbia. Their children attend Smithers High School, which is a publicly-run high school established pursuant to the provincial <cite>Education Act (British Columbia).</cite>
<P>
Section 11(b) of the <cite>Education Act </cite>provides that &quot;save for special language classes, instruction in public schools in the Province shall be in the English language.&quot; Section 14(c) requires all children between the ages of 6 and 14 to attend public school, with exceptions permitting home instruction in some circumstances as well as attendance at certain accredited private institutions.
<P>
The Ryans have come to your firm complaining of the fact that the school does not teach their children in the Tsimshian language. Tsimshian, which is the language of the Gitksan people, is spoken on the north-west coast around Prince Rupert and in the lower Nass and Skeena valleys where Smithers is located, and which historically
was Gitksan territory. Smithers has a population of approximately 2000 people, and its inhabitants are predominantly non-Aboriginal and English-speaking. There are about 150 Gitksan people living in the town; most Gitksan people live or near several reserves located approximately 70 kilometres from Smithers. There is a school on one of the reserves, established pursuant to the federal <cite>Indian Act, </cite>where students receive instruction in Gitksan, but the Ryans do not own a car and the school is too far to bus students to and from Smithers.
<P>
They state, and preliminary research bears this out, that teachers and administrators at the school received their training in, and predominantly come from, Vancouver or Victoria. No teacher or administrator either speaks Tsimshian or is Gitksan and, partly as a result, instructors have little knowledge of Gitksan traditions or culture. But for optional French language classes, courses at the school are taught in English. Nor do instructors make any
sustained effort to teach Gitksan history or beliefs. The Ryans fear that their children will lose their proficiency in Tsimshian, and that, as a result, they will become alienated from Gitksan history, traditions and culture.
<P>
Your principal has asked you to prepare a memorandum exploring possible Charter arguments that could be made in a constitutional challenge to the school's language policy. In particular, she has asked you to research ss. 2(b), 15, and 1 of the Charter, to outline and apply the relevant case law, identify useful arguments, identify and respond to those arguments that the school is likely to advance, and assess the likelihood of success of a challenge based on either ss. 2(b) or 15 of the Charter. She would also like guidance on what remedies she should seek in such a challenge. Please do not address any issues relating to s. 2(a) of the Charter as these are being addressed by another articling student.
<P><br>
<h3>QUESTION 2</h3>

Quebec's <cite>Charter of the French Language, </cite>intended to promote the use of the French language in the province, has a provision (s. 65) requiring that all prepackaged products offered for sale within the province be labelled both in French and English. Penalties for non-conformity with s. 65 include confiscation of the  inadequately labelled products and finess
<P>
Prior to and during the recent eight day Jewish holiday of Passover, many foodstores in Montreal with a large Jewish clientele imported and offered for sale a variety of kosher Passover foods. (Orthodox Jews follow a strict set of dietary laws. &quot;Kosher&quot; refers to foods certified as having been prepared in conformity with Jewish dietary laws under the supervision of a rabbi or other designated person. Foods certified as &quot;kosher for Passover&quot; conform with the additional requirement of Jewish law that no food containing leavening agents be eaten during the eight-day Passover period. Kosher Passover foods include not only foods required for Passover observance such as matzah (an unleavened bread), but also a wide array of every-day food products such as orange juice, condiments, and canned and packaged foods.) Almost all of the kosher Passover foods offered for sale in Montreal stores were imported from New York and bore labels only in English or English and Hebrew. Kosher food manufacturers in the U.S. have explored the possibility of producing special runs of Passover items with French labels, but have concluded that this is impractical and prohibitively expensive, particularly with respect to perishable
food products, given the relatively small market in Quebec. For example, one day's run of soup with bilingual labels would yield a six-year supply. While it would be possible for importers of the Passover products to create special French labels to be attached to the products, they have also concluded that this is too costly and would make the price of the products prohibitive.
<P>
Responding to some complaints about the English-only labels, the Language Office, which administers and enforces Quebec's language law, ordered several stores to remove the Passover foods from their shelves. The stores were warned that if they did not comply, the products would be confiscated and charges would be laid.
<P>
There is also federal legislation governing the labelling of products. The federal <cite>Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act </cite>governs the labelling of all prepackaged products sold in, imported into, or advertised for sale in Canada. Section 4 of the Act prohibits such sale, importation, or advertisement unless the product bears a label declaring the net quantity of the product in terms of either numerical count or a prescribed unit of measurement. Section 7 prohibits labels containing false or misleading representations about the product. Section 10 requires that labels show such information respecting the nature, contents and geographic origin of the product as may be prescribed by regulation. Section 20 of the Act creates an offence for violation of the Act and specifies penalties in
the form of imprisonment or fines.
<P>
Section 18(1) of the federal Act permits the Governor in Council to make detailed regulations with regard to label, form, and content, including regulations prescribing &quot;the language or languages in which any information required to be declared or shown on labels shall be declared or shown.&quot; Pursuant to that section, federal
regulations were passed, setting out in detail the contents and form of labels. Included was Regulation 6(2), titled &quot;Bilingualism Requirements&quot;, which requires that &quot;all information required by the Act and these Regulations to be shown on the label of a prepackaged product shall be shown in both official languages.&quot;
However, the federal regulations permit the Minister to grant exemptions from the labelling requirements in cases involving what are termed &quot;specialty products&quot;. The importers of kosher Passover foods have always applied for and been granted exemptions from the federal bilingualism regulations before bringing the products into the country.
<P>
A Jewish organization in Montreal wishes to bring legal proceedings to challenge the bilingual labelling requirements being imposed on Passover foods under the Quebec law. You are a junior lawyer in the law firm which the organization has approached for legal advice and you have been asked to write a memo on the following
aspects of this problem.
<blockquote>
(a) What arguments might be used to challenge the Quebec law on federalism grounds? What are the strengths and weaknesses of such of arguments? (Your answer to this issue will be worth 50% of Question 2.)
<P>
 (b) What arguments might be used to challenge the Quebec law on the basis that it interferes with freedom of religion as guaranteed by s. 2(a) of the <cite>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite>? What are the strengths and weaknesses of such arguments and, given s. 1 of the <cite>Charter, </cite>the likelihood of their
success? (Your answer to this issue will be worth 50% of Question 2.)

<b>1. (70 minutes)</b> Quebec enacted the <cite>Charter of the French Language </cite>to promote the use of French in the province. S.65 requires labeling in both French and English on all prepackaged products offered for sale. Failure to comply with s. 65 attracts penalties, including confiscation of the inadequately labeled products and fines.
<P>
Prior to and during the recent eight day Jewish holiday of Passover, stores in Montreal imported and offered for sale a variety of foods for the holiday. These foods complied with the relevant religious laws, which include the requirement of eating some foods (e.g., matzah, an unleavened bread), prohibition against eating other foods (e.g., bread, grains), and the permissibility of eating other foods only if certified as kosher for Passover by a recognized rabbinical authority (e.g., condiments, canned and packaged foods). Most of the Passover foods offered for sale in Montreal stores are imported from New York and bear the labels used in the U.S. market, i.e., English or English and Hebrew. Because of the wide variety of products and the fact that the market for them is both small and of limited duration, it would be prohibitively expensive for the American manufacturers or the Quebec importers and retailers to provide bilingual labels or add French labels.
<P>
Following up complaints about the English-only labels, the Language Office which administers and enforces the <cite>Charter of the French Language</cite> ordered several stores to remove the Passover foods from the
shelves or face confiscation and charges under the Act.
<P>
The federal <cite>Consumer Packaging and Labeling Act </cite>governs the labeling of all pre-packaged products sold in, imported into or advertised for sale in Canada as follows:
<ul>
<li>s. 4 requires a statement of the net quantity of the product by numerical count or a prescribed unit of measurement.
<li>s. 7 prohibits false or misleading representations about the product.
<li>s. 10 requires information respecting the nature, contents and geographic origin of the product as may be prescribed by regulation.
<li>s. 20 creates an offence for violation of the Act and specifies penalties in the form of imprisonment or fines.
<li>s. 18(1) permits the Governor in Council to make detailed regulations with regard to label form and content, including regulations prescribing &quot;the language or languages in which any information required to be declared or shown on labels shall be declared or shown.&quot;
<li>Regulation 6(2), titled &quot;Bilingualism Requirements&quot;, requires that &quot;All information required by the Act and these Regulations to be shown on the label of a pre-packaged product shall be shown in both official languages&quot;.
</ul>
In addition to these general rules, the Minister is also empowered by Regulation to grant exemptions from the labeling requirements for &quot;specialty products&quot;. This year, as in the past, the importers of kosher Passover foods applied for and received exemptions from the federal bilingualism regulations.
<P>
A Jewish organization in Montreal wants help in untangling the federal and provincial laws applicable to the importation of kosher food for Passover. In particular, the organization wants some legal assurance that the Jewish community will not have difficulty obtaining these foods in the future. You are a junior lawyer in the law firm that the organization has approached for legal advice. You are to write a memorandum of law on the federalism aspects of this problem. In your memo, set out the arguments which might be used on behalf of this client and assess the prospects of success. Do <b>not </b>deal with issues of standing or <cite>Charter</cite> issues.
<P><br>
<b>2. (70 minutes)</b> Since their introduction about 20 years ago, cochlear implants have gained acceptance as an option for individuals with profound hearing impairment for whom hearing aids are not effective. Unlike a  conventional hearing aid, which amplifies sounds, the implant bypasses damaged inner ear structures to send electrical signals directly to the auditory nerves. The vast majority of deaf adults with cochlear implants derive substantial benefit -- especially if the implantation follows soon after loss of hearing. Studies demonstrate decline
in loneliness, depression, and social isolation and an increase in self-esteem, independence, social integration, and vocational prospects.
<P>
The advisability of cochlear implants for children has proved more difficult to document. There is no data about the long term safety of the device and progress for children, while evident, is markedly slower than for adults, particularly for children who were born deaf. Some medical authorities are urging implantation earlier than the present recommended age (from 2 to 3 years) to take advantage of the period of greatest language learning capacity,
but earlier surgery would have to depend on less reliable testing of hearing levels and presents greater risk of complications. The surgery destroys the inner ear, precluding later use of technological developments that might require an intact inner ear. Success in learning to decode the electrical signals depends on sustained commitment by family members as well as extended and expensive, medical and educational support. There is considerable   anecdotal material indicating that some children, particularly those who have implants after hearing loss, do well with implants, e.g., integrating easily into regular classrooms, speaking on the phone, even taking music lessons.
<P>
Opposition to implants for children emanates from certain leaders within the deaf community. They view  implantation for children as misguided experimentation, based on the erroneous idea that deafness is a pathology or disability. For them, deafness is an individual identity as well as an exclusive, historic bond to a way of life defined by shared language and culture. All attempts to integrate the deaf into the hearing world by insisting on oral speech have failed in the past, they maintain, producing people who function poorly in both the hearing and the deaf world. Their literature includes the following statement:
<blockquote>
[Children with implants] will be forced to speak and not use sign language by their parents and audiologists. The deaf community is a very close one. Yet the deaf community will mock these people and they will feel left out of the community and certainly suffer as a result.
</blockquote>
These spokespersons devote themselves to creating a better future for the deaf against the background of Nazi persecution during World War II, eugenics policies that prohibited the marriage of deaf persons to each other, and the suppression of sign language in schools designated for the deaf in North America. They see hopeful signs in the enhanced respect for sign language and use of new electronic technologies, based on writing and images, that facilitate local and international communication. The biggest threat, in their view, is not the prejudice or ignorance of the past but the medical profession's desire, at great public expense and high psychological cost to the individuals affected, to snatch away the next generation.
<P>
Parents, who must give consent to implantation surgery for a deaf child, are caught between the opposing positions. They want to do the best for their child but find it difficult to make informed decisions given the conflicting understandings. These parents find attractive the possibility of providing some hearing capacity by means of an implant because a deaf child is prone to be solitary and hence vulnerable to dangers against which hearing children,
individually and in groups, are protected by warning sounds -- in the home, school and on the street. They also worry about their child's future because deaf children have in the past rarely mastered more than a basic facility in oral or written language and thus have had limited social, educational and vocational prospects. However, these parents are also moved by the anti-implant message from the community that presumably is most familiar with the burdens of deafness and the realistic possibilities of social life for deaf children beyond the family.
<P>
The groups who oppose implantation for children have approached the provincial government seeking legislation banning parental consent for cochlear implants for their children. They argue (1) that such legislation is necessary to sustain the future of their historically beleaguered, politically powerless and culturally creative, sign language based community, (2) that it is primarily wealthy and middle class parents who seek the implant for their children at public expense, thus leaving the deaf community with reduced resources and less effective community support, and (3) that in times of financial constraint the government should fund only those medical interventions that offer well-established health benefits.
<P>
You are a government lawyer who vets new policy proposals for their compatibility with the <cite>Charter</cite>. The premier's office has sent this proposal to you for consideration with the following annotation: &quot;Please

<b>35% 1.</b> Marlene D. (her stage name) is an aspiring actress. Originally from Toronto, she completed a degree in acting at Julliard and has spent the last five years in New York doing a lot of small theatre and developing her craft. Early on in her career she had the great fortune to meet and become friends with Darth Grabinsky, a hugely successful producer of live theatre in Toronto. Grabinsky, who has a keen eye for promising actors and actresses, took an interest in Marlene's career and over the years has provided her with much advice; his advice has invariably proved valuable to her. It was he who advised her, for example, to stay at Julliard when in her first year she was offered a part in the touring company of &quot;Cats&quot;. It was he who advised her to do summer stock in Syracuse, New York, with a small and relatively unknown but inspired group of actors who have since gone on to greatness. And it was he who advised her that if she really wanted to be taken seriously in the increasingly  sophisticated theatre world in Toronto, she should spend several years working in New York.
<P>
A little over a year and a half ago, Grabinsky called up Marlene to offer her a part in his upcoming production of &quot;sunrise on Avenue Road.&quot; &quot;It's not the lead&quot;, he told her, &quot;but it's a part that I think will bring you to the attention of the theatre here in Toronto. I think it's time to come back home and this is the play to do it.&quot; Marlene accepted on the spot.
<P>
When she got off the plane, Marlene collapsed in tears of joy and relief. Although she had learned a great deal during her time in New York and while she loved city living, she found Manhattan unbearable; she pined for
the Toronto she remembered from her undergraduate days at U of T. Moreover, she had always wished nothing more than to return home to Canada. Here was her dream come true.
<P>
Marlene packed up her things, paid up three months rent to get out of her lease in New York and moved to Toronto. Her plan was to reimmerse herself in Toronto Life, being work with local voice and drama coaches and get herself settled in her new life before rehearsals for &quot;Sunrise&quot; began. She rented an apartment in Cabbagetown and thoroughly enjoyed reacquainting herself with the city over the next several months. When the time came to begin rehearsals for &quot;Sunrise&quot; she told her friends she had never been so happy in her life; indeed, she had never realized how depressed and lonely she had been in New York.
<P>
One month into rehearsals Grabinsky came up to Marlene during a rehearsal break and told her that he was impressed with her performances. He said he had concluded that he had made a mistake casting her in  &quot;Sunrise&quot; in a supporting role and that he felt she was better suited for the lead in a smaller
production of &quot;Sunrise&quot; he was mounting simultaneously in Chicago. He told her he had replaced
her in the Toronto production with another actress and would arrange to have the Chicago rehearsals delayed a few weeks to give her a chance to move her things; he told her he anticipated a run of at least two years in Chicago. When Marlene told him she didn't want to go to the Chicago production, Grabinsky - who had a reputation for being somewhat volatile and arrogant - became angry, and berated her in front of the rest of the cast for fifteen minutes, telling her she was an ungrateful and foolish young woman.
<P>
Marlene was shattered by this turn of events. She couldn't bear the thought of moving to Chicago, giving up her life in Toronto and returning to the U.S. She also felt hurt and betrayed by Grabinsky, who had been like a father to her and on whom she had relied so heavily and on whom, it was clear, she could rely no more. She sank into a deep depression and lost all contact with Grabinsky. For the past year she has been unable to work in the theatre due to her depression and her lack of contacts in the business. She has depleted her savings, been forced to move into a rented room in a much less desirable neighbourhood and is scraping by on what she can earn waitressing.
<P>
Assume that it is clear that Grabinsky is in breach of his contract with Marlene by replacing her in the Toronto production of &quot;Sunrise&quot;. What damages might she expect to obtain if she sued for this breach of contract?
<P><br>
<b> 50% 2. a)</b> Alicia Dellarock, a renowned concert pianist, just returned to Toronto from a  four-month concert tour in Europe. She will be giving a series of lectures at U of T's music department throughout the Summer, and is moving permanently to New York City thereafter. Before she left for Europe, she sold everything she owned, including her Queen's Quay penthouse condominium. (Her lecturing contract with U of T provides her with on-campus accommodation for the Summer.) She had been unable to part with her beloved 1878 Steinway grand piano, however, and had therefore decided not to sell it, but rather to keep it in storage until her move to New York.
<P>
Concerned to find a reliable storage company, Alicia had turned for advice to Radoo Loopoo, an old friend of hers who had, just a year earlier, stored his own piano much to his satisfaction. Radoo had recommended that she contact
Eazee Storage Inc., the storage brokerage firm he had used at the time. &quot;They're great!&quot;, Radoo had assured her, &quot;They'll find you the best storage space in the city, and for cheap. You'll have no troubles with them. I'd stake my life on it.&quot; Alicia had thus arranged to meet with rooke Broker at Eazee Storage Inc.'s offices.
<P>
During this meeting, Brooke had explained to Alicia that, as a brokerage firm, Eazee Storage Inc. does not own the spaces rented out, but rather contracts out with property owners who have advertised available spaces.  &quot;Customers contact with us to arrange storage for them. We find out what's available, go check it out, and select only the spaces that meet our very high standards. For all this, we charge you the storage price paid to the property owner plus a mere 1% commission!&quot; She had added: &quot;As it turns out, I see on my list that we have a space that's just right for you. It is only three blocks away from where you live, so you wouldn't have to pay
much for moving.&quot;  Alicia had liked the idea of saving money on moving, but had nonetheless insisted that she needed a pressure-controlled space, as her piano was very old and could be damaged by pressure fluctuations. &quot;Most modern pianos can withstand pressure fluctuations,&quot; she had told Brooke, &quot;but mine is a collection piece with a very sensitive internal mechanism. It could be ruined if the pressure fluctuates.&quot;
Brooke had responded: &quot;Not to worry. All the spaces we select are pressure-controlled. That's just part of our ground rules.&quot;
<P>
Somewhat reassured, Alicia had then been presented with a copy of Eazee Storage Inc.'s standard &quot;Storage Agreement.&quot; She had asked whether this Agreement mentioned something about spaces being pressure-controlled, and Brooke had said that it did not. Alicia had then asked whether a clause to that effect could be added. Brooke had answered: &quot;Well, I don't like to make changes to the Agreement myself, but if it bothers you that much, we can always ask my boss to do it. He has left for the day, but will be back tomorrow. Now, I assure you, you need not worry about that. We <b>never</b> rent spaces that are not pressure-controlled.&quot; As Alicia had not wanted to have to come back the next day, she had told Brooke to proceed with the Agreement in its standard form. Brooke had filled out the storage space's location, rental period, and price in the blank spaces provided to that effect. The space would be rented from Stuart Storer, 300 Lakeshore Blvd., from January 1, 1996 to August 31,
1996, for the total price of $100/month. Brooke had handed the completed Agreement to Alicia, who had signed it without reading, and paid the total price of $800 upfront, as was required of her under the Agreement.
<P>
Yesterday, upon returning from Europe, Alicia went to 300 Lakeshore Blvd. to check on her piano. She was very distressed to find out that the space had not been pressure-controlled, and that her precious 1878 Steinway has lost its unique resonance as a result. While it probably can be resold to a beginner as a basic practice piano, it is unusable by her or by any other concert pianist. She asked Stuart Storer why the space had not been pressure-controlled, and Stuart responded: &quot;This is the first I've heard of pressure-control. None of my spaces is pressure-controlled. We're simply not equipped for it!&quot; Alicia then called Brooke, who apologized profusely,
but stopped short of offering Alicia any form of compensation. Nor would she release her from her contract for the months of May to August. &quot;I'm really sorry for this unfortunate mishap,&quot; Brooke said, &quot;but we never gave you any warranties to that effect.&quot; She then referred Alicia to a paragraph in smaller print at the very end of the Storage Agreement. This paragraph contains the following clause, which is commonly found in storage contracts:
<blockquote>
&quot;Eazee Storage Inc. gives no warranty as to temperature or any other matter pertaining to the maintenance of the storage space.&quot;
</blockquote>
Alicia has asked you to advise her. Specifically, she wants to know whether she can hope to recover any of the piano's lost value, her moving expenses, and/or her $800 from Eazee Storage Inc. or Radoo Loopoo. (She recently had a fight with him and would have no problems seeing him in court.)
<P>
You are to assume that Eazee Storage Inc. is fully bound by Brooke Broker's actions, and that it cannot be established that Brooke Broker or Eazee Storage Inc. acted with malice or fraud in this matter. Please ignore possible tort issues, as welt as the issue of whether Eazee Storage Inc. can recover from Stuart Storer.
<P>
<b>b)</b> Assume the same facts as for Question 2(a), except that the lack of pressure-control is instead due to the negligence of an employee of Stuart Storer, and that the Storage Agreement between Alicia and Eazee Storage Inc. contains the following clause:
<blockquote>
It is hereby expressly agreed that neither Eazee Storage Inc., nor its servants or agents, shall in any circumstances whatsoever be liable to the customer for any loss or damage arising from any act, neglect or default on its part while acting in the course of its performance of the present Agreement.
</blockquote>
Could Alicia recover damages from Stuart Storer's employees?
<P><br>
<b>15% 3.</b>
<blockquote>
If, whatever a man's real intention may be, he so conducts himself that a reasonable man would believe that he was assenting to the terms proposed by the other party, and that other party upon that belief enters into the contract with him, the man thus conducting himself would be equally bound as if he had intended to agree to the other party's terms.

<b>1.</b> Marlene D. (her stage name) is an aspiring actress. Originally from Toronto, she completed a degree in acting at Julliard and has spent the last five years in New York doing a lot of small theatre and developing her craft. Early on in her career she had the great fortune to meet and become friends with Darth Grabinsky, a hugely  successful producer of live theatre in Toronto. Grabinsky, who has a keen eye for promising actors and actresses, took an interest in Marlene's career and over the years has provided her with much advice; his advice has invariably proved valuable to her. It was he who advised her, for example, to stay at Julliard when in her first year she was offered a part in the touring company of &quot;Cats&quot;. It was he who advised her to do summer stock in Syracuse, New York, with a small and relatively unknown but inspired group of actors who have since gone on to greatness. And it was he who advised her that if she really wanted to be taken seriously in the increasingly sophisticated theatre world in Toronto, she should spend several years working in New York.
<P>
A little over a year and a half ago, Grabinsky called up Marlene to offer her a part in his upcoming production of &quot;Sunrise on Avenue Road.&quot; &quot;It's not the lead&quot;, he told her, &quot;but it's the biggest part that I can offer you at the moment and it will bring you to the attention of the theatre world in North America.&quot; Marlene accepted on the spot.
<P>
When she got off the plane, Marlene collapsed in tears of joy and relief. Although she had learned a great deal during her time in New York and while she loved city living, she found Manhattan unbearable; she pined for the Toronto she remembered from her undergraduate days at U of T. Moreover, she had always wished for nothing more than to return home to Canada. Here was her dream come true.
<P>
Marlene packed up her things, paid up three months rent to get out of her lease in New York and moved to Toronto. Her plan was to reimmerse herself in Toronto life, do work with local voice and drama coaches and get herself settled in her new life before rehearsals for &quot;Sunrise&quot; began. She rented an apartment in Cabbagetown and thoroughly enjoyed reacquainting herself with the city over the next several months. When the time came to begin rehearsals for &quot;Sunrise&quot; she told her friends she had never been so happy in her life; indeed, she had never realized how depressed and lonely she had been in New York.
<P>
One month into rehearsals Grabinsky came up to Marlene during a rehearsal break and told her that he was impressed with her performances. He said he had concluded that he had made a mistake casting her in &quot;Sunrise&quot; in a supporting role and that he felt she was better suited for the lead in a smaller production
of &quot;Sunrise&quot; he was mounting simultaneously in Chicago. He told her he had replaced her in the Toronto production with another actress and would arrange to have the Chicago rehearsals delayed a few weeks to give her a chance to move her things; he told her he anticipated a run of at least two years in Chicago. When Marlene told him she didn't want to go to the Chicago production, Grabinsky - who had a reputation for being somewhat volatile and arrogant - became angry, and berated her in front of the rest of the cast for fifteen minutes, telling her she was an ungrateful and foolish young woman.
<P>
Marlene was shattered by this turn of events. She couldn't bear the thought of moving to Chicago, giving up her life in Toronto and returning to the U.S. She also felt hurt and betrayed by Grabinsky, who had been like a father to her and on whom she had relied so heavily and on whom, it was clear, she could rely no more. She sank into a deep depression and lost all contact with Grabinsky. For the past year she has been unable to work in the theatre due to her depression and her lack of contacts in the business. She has depleted her savings, been forced to move into a rented room in a much less desirable neighbourhood and is scraping by on what she can earn waitressing.
<P>
She seeks your legal opinion as to her legal rights against Grabinsky.
<P><br>
<b>2. a)</b> Alicia Dellarock, a renowned concert pianist, has just returned to Toronto from a four-month concert tour in Europe. She will be giving a series of lectures at U of T's music department throughout the Summer, and is moving permanently to New York City thereafter. Before she left for Europe, she sold everything she owned, including her Queen's Quay penthouse condominium. (Her lecturing contract with U of T provides her with on-campus accommodation for the summer.) She had been unable to part with her beloved 1878 Steinway grand piano, however, and had therefore decided not to sell it, but rather to keep it in storage until her move to New York.
<P>
Concerned to find a reliable storage company, Alicia had turned for advice to Radoo Loopoo, an old friend of hers who had, just a year earlier, stored his own piano much to his satisfaction. Radoo had recommended that she contact Eazee Storage Inc., the storage brokerage firm he had used at the time. &quot;They're great!&quot;, Radoo had assured her, &quot;They'll find you the best and cheapest storage space in the city. You'll have no troubles with them. I'd stake my life on it.&quot; Alicia had thus arranged to meet with Brooke Broker at Eazee Storage Inc.'s offices.
<P>
During this meeting, Brooke had explained to Alicia that, as a brokerage firm, Eazee Storage Inc. does not own the spaces rented out, but rather contracts out with property owners who have available spaces. &quot;Customers contract with us to arrange storage for them. We find out what's available, go check it out, and select only the spaces that meet our very high standards. For all this, we charge you the storage price paid to the property owner plus
a mere 1% commission!&quot; She had added: &quot;As it turns out, I see on my list that we have a space that's just right for you. It is only three blocks away from where you live, so you wouldn't have to pay much for moving.&quot; Alicia had liked the idea of saving money on moving, but had nonetheless insisted that she needed a pressure-controlled space, as her piano was very old and could be damaged by pressure fluctuations. &quot;Most modern pianos can withstand pressure fluctuations,&quot; she had told Brooke, &quot;but mine is a collection piece with a very sensitive internal mechanism. It could be ruined if the pressure fluctuates.&quot; Brooke had responded: &quot;Not to worry. All the spaces we select are pressure-controlled. That's just part of our ground rules.&quot;
<P>
Somewhat reassured, Alicia had then been presented with a copy of Eazee Storage Inc.'s standard &quot;Storage Agreement.&quot; She had asked whether this Agreement mentioned something about spaces being pressure-controlled, and Brooke had said that it did not. Alicia had then asked whether a clause to that effect could be added. Brooke had answered: &quot;Well, I don't like to make changes to the Agreement myself, but if it bothers you that much, we can always ask my boss to do it. He has left for the day, but will be back tomorrow. Now, I assure you, you need not worry about that. We <b>never</b> rent spaces that are not pressure-controlled.&quot; As Alicia had not wanted to have to come back the next day, she had told Brooke to proceed with the Agreement in its standard form. Brooke had filled out the storage space's location, rental period, and price in the blank spaces provided to that effect. The space would be rented from Stuart Storer, 300 Lakeshore Blvd., from January 1, 1996 to August 31,
1996, for the total price of $100/month. Brooke had handed the completed Agreement to Alicia, who had signed it without reading it, and paid the total price of $800 upfront, as was required of her under the Agreement.
<P>
Yesterday, upon returning from Europe, Alicia went to 300 Lakeshore Blvd. to check on her piano. She was very distressed to find out that the space had not been pressure-controlled, and that her precious 1878 Steinway has lost its unique resonance as a result. While it probably can be resold to a beginner as a basic practice piano, it is unusable by her or by any other concert pianist. She asked Stuart Storer why the space had not been pressure-controlled, and Stuart responded: &quot;This is the first I've heard of pressure-control. None of my spaces is pressure-controlled. We're simply not equipped for it!&quot; Alicia then called Brooke, who apologized profusely,
but stopped short of offering Alicia any form of compensation. Nor would she release her from her contract for the months of May to August. &quot;I'm really sorry for this unfortunate mishap,&quot; Brooke said, &quot;but we never gave you any warranties to that effect.&quot; She then referred Alicia to a paragraph in smaller print at the very end of the Storage Agreement. This paragraph contains the following clause, which is commonly found in storage contracts:
<blockquote>
&quot;Eazee Storage Inc. gives no warranty as to temperature or any other matter pertaining to the maintenance of the storage space.
</blockquote>
Alicia has asked you to advise her. Specifically, she wants to know whether she can hope to recover any of the piano's lost value, her moving expenses, and/or her $800 from Eazee Storage Inc. or Radoo Loopoo. (She recently had a fight with him and would have no problems seeing him in court.)
<P>
You are to assume that Eazee Storage Inc. is fully bound by Brooke Broker's actions, and that it cannot be established that Brooke Broker or Eazee Storage Inc. acted with malice or fraud in this matter.
<P>
<b>b)</b> Assume the same facts as for Question 2(a), except that the space was fitted with pressure-control but it had just been activated due to the negligence of an employee of Stuart Storer, and that the Storage Agreement between Alicia and Eazee Storage Inc. contains the following clause:
<blockquote>
&quot;It is hereby expressly agreed that neither Eazee Storage Inc., nor its servants or agents, shall in any circumstances whatsoever be liable to the customer for any loss or damage arising from any act, neglect or default on its part while acting in the course of its performance of the present Agreement. &quot;
</blockquote>
Can Alicia recover damages from Stuart Storer's employees?
<P><br>
<b>3.</b> James Booker, a farmer near Flesherton, Ontario, entered into a written agreement on June 1st, 1995 to sell his 100-acre farm to Fred and Janet DeLuca for $200,000 as a retirement residence. The farm includes a  picturesque turn-of-the-century red-brick Victorian home (in original and rather dilapidated condition) where Agnes McPhail, Canada's first woman Parliamentarian, once lived. The closing date for the sale was August 31st, 1995.
<P>
Discuss the legal implications of each of the following scenarios:
<P>
<b>a)</b> Unknown to any of the parties the farm is the site of a buried toxic waste dump dating back several owners (and decades). This dump is uncovered in January 1996 when the DeLuca's were having excavations undertaken in the course of construction of a pond. It has contaminated the farm's water supply and will cost $1 million to clean up.
<P>
<b>b)</b> The facts are as in (a) but the excavations reveal a major mineral deposit.
<P>
<b>c)</b> Shortly before the transaction was to close on August 31st, 1995, the provincial government proclaimed the farm a &quot;National Treasure&quot; under relevant legislation, which precludes any significant modifications to the farm or its buildings, including the farmhouse, which the DeLuca's had intended substantially to remodel and update, and which allows the public to view the home externally at any time during daylight hours.

Although she had learned a great deal during her time in New York and while she loved city living, she found Manhattan unbearable; she pined for the Toronto she remembered from her undergraduate days at U. of T. Moreover, she had always wished nothing more than to return home to Canada. Here was her dream come true.
<P>
Grabinsky sent Marlene a standard form contract which stated &quot;Actor agrees to comply with the following conditions&quot; and listed 26 conditions, including, showing up for all rehearsals on time, refraining from any activity which would jeopardize the actor's ability to perform, complying with all directions from the director and producer, and undertaking whatever professional training was deemed necessary to put on a first-rate production. The contract also stated: &quot;Producer retains the right to cancel, discontinue, or modify the production or the actor's engagement in any way he deems desirable and for any reason at any time.&quot;
<P>
Marlene packed up her things, paid up three months rent to get out of her lease in New York and moved to Toronto. Her plan was to reimmerse herself in Toronto life, begin work with local voice and drama coaches and get herself settled in her new life before rehearsals for &quot;Sunrise&quot; began.

She has depleted her savings, been forced to move into a rented room in a much less desirable neighbourhood and is scraping by on what she can earn waitressing.
<P>
Is it worth it for Marlene to sue Grabinsky? (Assume that the Toronto contract is with Grabinsky in his capacity as &quot;Producer&quot; and that had Marlene gone to Chicago her contract would have been with a Chicago corporation and not with Grabinsky himself.)

<b>50% 1. a)</b> Alicia Dellarock, a renowned concert pianist, just returned to Toronto from a four-month concert tour in Europe. She will be giving a series of lectures at U of T's music department throughout the Summer, and is moving permanently to New York City thereafter. Before she left for Europe, she sold everything she owned, including her Queen's Quay penthouse condominium. (Her lecturing contract with U of T provides her with on-campus accommodation for the Summer.) She had been unable to part with her beloved 1878 Steinway grand piano, however, and had therefore decided not to sell it, but rather to keep it in storage until her move to New York.
<P>
Concerned to find a reliable storage company, Alicia had turned for advice to Radoo Loopoo, an old friend of hers who had, just a year earlier, stored his own piano much to his satisfaction. Radoo had recommended that she contact
Eazee Storage Inc., the storage brokerage firm he had used at the time. &quot;They're great!&quot;, Radoo had assured her, &quot;They'll find you the best storage space in the city, and for cheap. You'll have no troubles with them. I'd stake my life on it.&quot; Alicia had thus arranged to meet with Brooke Broker at Eazee Storage Inc.'s offices.
<P>
During this meeting, Brooke had explained to Alicia that, as a brokerage firm, Eazee Storage Inc. does not own the spaces rented out, but rather contracts out with property owners who have advertised available spaces. &quot;Customers contract with us to arrange storage for them. We find out what's available, go check it out, and select only the spaces that meet our very high standards. For all this, we charge you the storage price paid to the property owner plus a mere 1% commission!&quot; She had added: &quot;As it turns out, I see on my list that we have a space that's just right for you. It is only three blocks away from where you live, so you wouldn't have to pay
much for moving.&quot; Alicia had liked the idea of saving money on moving, but had nonetheless insisted that she needed a pressure-controlled space, as her piano was very old and could be damaged by pressure fluctuations. &quot;Most modern pianos can withstand pressure fluctuations,&quot; she had told Brooke, &quot;but mine is a collection piece with a very sensitive internal mechanism. It could be ruined if the pressure fluctuates.&quot;
Brooke had responded: &quot;Not to worry. All the spaces we select are pressure-controlled. That's just part of our ground rules.&quot;

Somewhat reassured, Alicia had then been presented with a copy of Eazee Storage Inc.'s standard &quot;Storage Agreement.&quot; She had asked whether this Agreement mentioned something about spaces being pressure-controlled, and Brooke had said that it did not.  Alicia had then asked whether a clause to that effect could be added. Brooke had answered: &quot;Well, I don't like to make changes to the Agreement myself, but if it bothers you that much, we can always ask my boss to do it. He has left for the day, but will be back tomorrow. Now, I assure you, you need not worry about that. We <b>never</b> rent  spaces that are not pressure-controlled.&quot; As Alicia had
not wanted to have to come back the next day, she had told Brooke to proceed with the Agreement in its standard  form. Brooke had filled out the storage space's location, rental period, and price in the blank spaces provided to that effect. The space would be rented from Stuart Storer, 300 Lakeshore Blvd., from January 1, 1996 to August 31, 1996, for the total price of $100/month. Brooke had handed the completed Agreement to Alicia, who had signed it without reading, and paid the total price of $800 upfront, as was required of her under the Agreement.
<P>
Yesterday, upon returning from Europe, Alicia went to 300 Lakeshore Blvd. to check on her piano. She was very distressed to find out that the space had not been pressure-controlled, and that her precious 1878 Steinway has lost its unique resonance as a result. While it probably can be resold to a beginner as a basic practice piano, it is unusable by her or by any other concert pianist. She asked Stuart Storer why the space had not been pressure-controlled, and Stuart responded: &quot;This is the first I've heard of pressure-control. None of my spaces is pressure-controlled. We're simply not equipped for it!&quot; Alicia then called Brooke, who apologized profusely,
but stopped short of offering Alicia any form of compensation. Nor would she release her from her contract for the months of May to August. &quot;I'm really sorry for this unfortunate mishap,&quot; Brooke said, &quot;but we never gave you any warranties to that effect.&quot; She then referred Alicia to a paragraph in smaller print at the very end of the Storage Agreement. This paragraph contains the following clause, which is commonly found in storage contracts:
<blockquote>
&quot;Eazee Storage Inc. gives no warranty as to temperature or any other matter pertaining to the maintenance of the storage space.
</blockquote>
Alicia has asked you to advise her. Specifically, she wants to know whether she can hope to recover any of the piano's lost value, her moving expenses, and/or her $800 from Eazee Storage Inc. or Radoo Loopoo. (She recently had a fight with him and would have no problems seeing him in court.)
<P>
You are to assume that Eazee Storage Inc. is fully bound by Brooke Broker's actions, and that it cannot be established that Brooke Broker or Eazee Storage Inc. acted with malice or fraud in this matter. Please ignore possible tort issues, as well as the issue of whether Eazee Storage Inc. can recover from Stuart Storer.
<P>
<b>b)</b> Assume the same facts as for Question l(a), except that the lack of pressure-control is instead due to the negligence of an employee of Stuart Storer, and that the Storage Agreement between Alicia and Eazee Storage Inc. contains the following clause:
<blockquote>
It is hereby expressly agreed that neither Eazee Storage Inc., nor its servants or agents, shall in any circumstances whatsoever be liable to the customer for any loss or damage arising from any act, neglect or default on its part while acting in the course of its performance of the present Agreement.
</blockquote>
Could Alicia recover damages from Stuart Storer's employees?
<P>
<b>50% 2.</b>
<blockquote>
If, whatever a man's real intention may be, he so conducts himself that a reasonable man would believe that he was assenting to the terms proposed by the other party, and that other party upon that belief enters into the contract with him, the man thus conducting himself would be equally bound as if he had intended to agree to the other party's terms.

<b>1.</b> Emma had an unhappy childhood. Her parents were divorced when she was five, and from then until she left home at eighteen, she lived with her mother, who was an alcoholic, and her mother's common-law spouse, who frequently struck and belittled her. While still living at home, she tried to commit suicide several times by cutting her wrists, and after each of these incidents, her &quot;stepfather&quot; would taunt her with such comments as &quot;Can't you even do that right?&quot;, &quot;You're hopeless at everything, aren't you,&quot; and the like.
<P>
Soon after leaving home, Emma moved in with Trevor. Trevor was jealous and possessive and frequently slapped and berated Emma for imagined infidelities. One day Trevor told Emma that he had grown tired of her, that he had a new girlfriend, and that he wanted her to leave. Emma meekly obliged, but a week later she returned, begging Trevor to take her back. He refused. Emma then began beating Trevor on the chest with her fists, telling him that she would commit suicide if he didn't take her back. At this Trevor (who knew of the previous incidents) laughed loudly and jeered: &quot;D'ya think ya can do the job right this time?&quot;
<P>
Emma left. Trevor's comment did not hit home instantly, but as she walked away, his words kept reverberating in her head and mingled with the memory of her stepfather's similar taunts. Other incidents in her past came back to her as well, and suddenly she saw her life for the first time as an endless cycle of affection-seeking, rejection, and humiliation. Very slowly anger welled up inside her until she could no longer contain it. She stopped, picked up a rock on the side of the road, and walked in a daze back to Trevor's flat. When he answered the doorbell, Emma struck him on the head with the rock with all the force she could muster. When Trevor collapsed, she struck him twice more on the face. Then she called the police and told them she had killed her &quot;father.&quot; &quot;I done it,&quot; she said, &quot;'cause he deserved to die.&quot;
<P>
Trevor, however, was not yet dead. He was taken unconscious to the hospital, where it was discovered that, besides the head injuries he had sustained, he had a pre-existing duodenal ulcer which, if not operated upon, might rupture and kill him. However, the doctors concluded that, because of Trevor's head injuries, it would be more dangerous to anaesthetize him for an operation on the ulcer than to wait until he regained consciousness. A few days later, Trevor, still unconscious, died of bleeding from the ulcer.
<P>
Emma was charged with murder. At her trial she raised the defence of provocation. A psychiatrist testifying on her behalf told the jury that Emma exhibited a &quot;depressive disorder&quot; characterized by deep feelings of ineptitude, helplessness, and low self-esteem but that she was not medically insane. He also testified that many women react to insult with a &quot;slow burn&quot; rather than by flying immediately off the handle, which, he said, is a response more typical of men. The trial judge, in instructing the jury on provocation, told them not to take into account Emma's depressive disorder in applying the standard of the ordinary person. He also told them that, to qualify for the defence, the accused must have struck &quot;at the instant of the provocation and before her passion had time to cool.&quot; Finally, he told them that if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Emma intentionally caused Trevor's death and did not qualify for the defence of provocation, they should find her guilty of murder.
<P>
The jury came back with a verdict of guilty. The Crown then called a psychiatrist, who testified that Emma might not have understood what she was doing or that it was wrong and that her violent attack probably stemmed from deep-seated feelings of inadequacy. The judge then put the defence of mental disorder to the jury using nothing beyond the language of s. 16. The jury returned a verdict of not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder. Emma is now in a hospital for the insane. She will be there for the rest of her life or until doctors think it safe to release her.
<P>
Discuss the grounds of an appeal by Emma.
<P><br>
<b>2.</b> After acquiring the appropriate licence, J set up a laboratory to manufacture a line of pharmaceuticals. These drugs were on the list of controlled substances found in schedule G of the <cite>Food and Drugs Act</cite>. In the manufacturing process, J used chemicals which, when combined, produced a new substance akin to mescaline
but having many of the properties of phencyclidine. J asked a Nobel laureate chemistry professor at the University of Toronto what the substance was and was told it was mescaline. He also asked a lawyer who told him he could rely on the chemistry professor. So J produced what he thought was mescaline but without having obtained what he thought was the required licence for manufacturing it. He believed that mescaline was a restricted drug needing a
special licence to produce it, but in reality it is a controlled drug whose production was authorized by the licence J had already obtained.
<P>
J was charged with trafficking in phencyclidine. At his trial the judge ruled that the substance J was producing was mescaline and dismissed the charge. On appeal by the Crown, a judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario ruled that the substance was phencyclidine and substituted a conviction. Meanwhile H. after hearing of the trial judge's decision in J's case, also began producing the new substance (thinking it was mescaline), but without first obtaining
a licence to produce a controlled drug. He was charged with trafficking in phencyclidine and convicted by a judge who relied on the previous decision of the Supreme Court.
<P>
Mescaline is listed among the controlled drugs one is forbidden to manufacture without proper authority by s. 39 of the <cite>Food and Drugs Act</cite>. The penalty for a violation is a prison term not exceeding ten years. The penalty for an unauthorized manufacture of a restricted drug is the same. Phencyclidine is a narcotic whose manufacture and sale are regulated by the <cite>Narcotic Control Act</cite>. The penalty for trafficking in it is a maximum term of life imprisonment. &quot;Trafficking&quot; is defined in both Acts so as to include the manufacture of a listed substance without proper authority.
<P>
Discuss the penal liability of J and H.
<P><br>
<b>3.</b> Write a case comment on <cite>R. v. Hundel</cite> (casebook, p. 216). Explain the significance of the case as well as your agreement or disagreement with its reasoning and conclusions.

<h3>THIS QUESTION IS COMPULSORY:</h3>

<b>1.</b> One night Tom, Dick and Harry met for a game of poker. Tom and Dick were old friends, having met several years earlier while they were both serving sentences for aggravated assault. Harry was a recent acquaintance they'd met in a pub.
<P>
During the poker game, Tom, who was down on his luck, suggested that the three of them consider robbing a bank. Dick, who was short on cash, immediately agreed, but Harry wasn't so sure it was a good idea. Harry had already served a jail term for possession for the purpose of trafficking and didn't want to go back to jail. After some persuasion on the part of Tom and Dick, Harry said, &quot;Okay, I'll help you guys. But, ya gotta promise that no
one's gonna get hurt. I don't wanna go back to the slammer. No real weapons, Okay?&quot;
<P>
After talking it over for a bit, the trio agreed that they would not use real guns. They would, instead, use very realistic looking facsimiles which Dick knew how to procure.
<P>
On the day in question, the three met at Harry's house which was down the block from the bank. As planned, Dick had brought three fake guns with him. To the surprise of Dick and Harry, Tom revealed that he was carrying a real gun and that he was intending to carry it with him during the robbery. &quot;Come on guys, don't be stupid,&quot; Tom said. &quot;We need a real gun for our own protection. I won't use it unless I have to. Besides, I'll only fire warning shots. I'm not going to kill anyone.&quot;
<P>
&quot;No way!&quot; Harry said, &quot;you're not going in there with a gun. I'm not taking any chances. I'm not going through with this unless you leave the gun here.&quot;
<P>
&quot;I don't care what you do,&quot; Dick said. &quot;Just hurry up and decide, or else we'll blow our chance to do the job.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Okay, Harry,&quot; Tom said, &quot;you win. How 'bout if I take the gun but leave the bullets? See look, it's empty. I'll leave all the bullets here on Dick's coffee table .&quot;
<p>
&quot;Thanks, Tom,&quot; said Harry. &quot;Okay guys, let's go.&quot;
<P>
When they arrived at the bank, Harry gave the teller, Laura Secord, a note that read, &quot;This is a stick up. Give me all your money. We are armed and dangerous.&quot; Laura indicated that she would comply, but as she was collecting the cash, she pushed a hidden alarm button. The button triggered a silent alarm that was connected to the police station.
<P>
Unfortunately for Tom, Dick and Harry, two police cruisers were just leaving &quot;Donut Delite,&quot; a favourite police hang out that was located across the street from the bank. The officers responded immediately to the alarm and were inside the bank within seconds.
<p>
Officer Murphy spotted the suspects instantly. &quot;Drop your weapons and put your hands up,&quot; she shouted. Tom, Dick and Harry looked at each other in a panic. Then, Tom pulled a gun out of his jacket, grabbed Melvin Mirvish (a customer who just happened to be standing at the next teller) and yelled, &quot;NO! You guys drop YOUR weapons - or else this guy gets hurt.&quot; To show he meant business, Tom fired a warning shot into the air. Unbeknownst to either Dick or Harry, Tom had been carrying TWO real guns. He had only emptied the bullets from one of them.
<p>
Unperturbed, Officer Murphy drew her weapon and fired back. Unfortunately, the bullet struck Laura Secord in the chest. In the commotion that followed, Tom, Dick and Harry were subdued and arrested and Laura Secord was taken by ambulance to the hospital.
<p>
Laura's wound was serious but not life threatening. Unfortunately, while in hospital, Laura contracted an antibiotic resistant infection. After battling the infection for two months Laura died.
<p>
Tom, Dick, and Harry are all charged with first degree murder. Are they guilty?
<p><br>
<h3>CHOOSE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING TWO QUESTIONS:</h3>

<b>2.</b> In <cite>R. v. Creighton</cite>, the Supreme Court of Canada held that it was constitutionally permissible to impose criminal liability on the basis of objective fault. The court, however, split on how the objective standard should be constructed. Do you agree that it is right to hold people criminally liable on an objective standard or should our criminal justice system always require an element of subjective fault? Assuming that we continue to permit the <I>mens rea</I>for certain offenses to be based on an objective standard, how should the objective standard be constructed? In your view, do either of the judgments in <cite>Creighton</cite> set out the correct blue print for constructing the reasonable person?
<p>
<center><h3>OR</h3></center>

<b>3.</b> The problem of the criminal responsibility of the intoxicated offender has long plagued the legal system. With this in mind, comment on the Supreme Court's decision in <cite>R. v. Daviault</cite>. Does either the majority or the dissent chart the correct course for dealing with the drunken offender? What problems, if any, are there with the judgments? Is there a better way of handling the intoxicated offender? Finally, in light of the reasoning in <cite>Daviault</cite>, comment on the constitutional validity of s. 33.1 of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>, reproduced below.
<blockquote>
s. 33.1(1) It is not a defense to an offense referred to in subsection (3) that the accused, by reason of self-induced intoxication, lacked the general intent or the voluntariness required to commit the offense, where the accused has departed markedly from the standard of care as described in subsection (2). <a href="#note">*</a>
<p>
(2) For the purposes of this section, a person departs markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society and is thereby criminally at fault where the person, while in a state of self-induced intoxication that renders that person unaware of, or incapable of consciously controlling, their behaviour, voluntarily or involuntarily interferes or threatens to interfere with the bodily integrity of another person.
<p>
(3) This section applies in respect of an offence under This Act or any other Act of Parliament that includes as an element an assault or any other interference or threat of interference by a person with the bodily integrity of another person.
</blockquote>
<a name="note">*</a> Please note that the use of the word &quot;general&quot; in this section differs from the Bill I handed out in class.

<h3>Question 1 (Counting for 50 percent of the total mark)</h3>

AB is a twenty-eight year-old member of a motor-cycle gang that traffics in drugs and has a recent history of related violence, including causing explosions of rival gang members' premises and equipment located in public places, causing serious injuries to members of the public. AB contracted HIV-infection from needle-sharing in injection drug use, and is in acute distress in the terminal phases of AIDS.
<P>
CD is a forty-eight year-old pharmacist employed in a pharmacy close to AB's gang headquarters. A month ago, five members of the gang entered the pharmacy, and demanded that CD supply and administer pain-killing drugs to AB, who lived in the gang's headquarters. CD knew that AB had already received prescriptions of pain-killing drugs at dosages close to a toxic level, and informed the gang-members that stronger pain-killing drugs could prove fatal to AB. The gang-members threatened CD that if he refused to help their colleague, the gang could not guarantee that CD's elderly parents or sixteen-year-old step-daughter would see 1997 in good health. Accompanied by the gang-members, CD took some drugs from the pharmacy and went to the gang's headquarters. He spoke in an upstairs bedroom to AB, who said that his pain was unbearable, and that he would prefer his life to end earlier in comfort rather than have to endure further suffering. CD said he did not need directly to administer the drugs he had brought to AB, since they were in capsules that AB could take unaided, and that he had brought enough for eight separate pain-relieving administrations. He informed AB that if he took too many, he might die, realizing that this was probably what AB intended. Before CD left the bedroom, AB seized and swallowed the equivalent of five doses.
<p>
AB died early the next day, and police traced the remaining pain-killing drugs to the pharmacy and to CD. CD has now been charged with the indictable offense under s.241(b) of the Criminal Code of aiding suicide.
<p>
Explain how you would defend CD.

<h3>Question 2 (Counting for 50 percent of the total mark)</h3>

EF was aged twenty-three two years ago when her grandfather died leaving her six acres of land on the outskirts of an expanding town in southern Ontario. The land had once been in agricultural use, but had not been farmed for several years. The grandfather's will expressed the wish that EF should develop the land to provide her with future income. EF was a student in a university commerce programme, and decided to use the land in the short term to finance graduate studies in business administration.
<p>
EF placed an advertisement in several newspapers that the land was available on a three year lease for a use that was permitted under local zoning regulations. GH and IJ offered to lease the land for recreational development, at a rent that seemed adequate to cover EF's fees and living expenses for a graduate programme of studies. The rent offered was, unknown to EF, six times the current rental value. A local lawyer drafted the lease, which included standard clauses against unlawful use of the land, insurance and indemnification of EF against legal liability arising from use, and EF's right of inspection, after due notice, to ensure compliance with local by-laws.
<p>
Ten months after granting the lease, EF visited the area and, one evening, when she went to the estate, she found a sizeable, noisy crowd gathered in a new, tavern-like structure built at a remote site on the leased land. She did not enter, she later explained to the local lawyer, for fear that the premises were being used for gaming or perhaps indecent entertainment. Two months ago, the police raided the building, and found that it was being used to stage cockfighting and betting. GH and IJ were not present, and are believed to have left Canada.
<p>
EF has now been charged with the summary offenses, contrary to s.447(1) of the Criminal Code, of keeping a cockpit on premises that she owns, and allowing a cockpit to be built or maintained there.
<p>
Explain how you would defend EF.
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> You have not been given the language of the information, and should not address issues of vagueness.

<b>1. (45 marks approx. 80 minutes)</b> Jones and Smith were released from Kingston Penitentiary on the same day. They had both served long periods of time for violent crimes. As they were wandering around downtown Kingston they discussed the terrible treatment they had received by Guard Green while they were in the  penitentiary. Jones suggested that they &quot;get even&quot; by kidnapping and torturing Green. Smith said he wasn't interested in settling old scores, but reluctantly agreed to go along with the idea after Jones said that if he didn't he (Smith) might end up with a knife in his back.
<P>
They stole a car, waited for Green to leave the penitentiary, grabbed him and stuffed him in the trunk of the car. When they got to a deserted open field, Jones opened the trunk. Smith started lifting Green out of the trunk.
Green shouted: &quot;You'll never get away with this, you perverted jailbirds.&quot; Jones instinctively grabbed the tire iron and struck Green violently over the head with it. They left, thinking Green was dead. Green was found still alive the next day by a farmer and was taken to the Kingston Hospital. Green died in the recovery room following a brain operation when one of the monitors indicating a deteriorating, but correctible, condition failed to work properly.
<P>
Jones and Smith had taken Guard Green's gun and decided to rob a branch of the Bank of Nova Scotia. First they bought and consumed together a 26 ounce bottle of whisky and a case of beer (24 bottles). The branch was closed
when they arrived and the teller refused to open the door. They then went to a branch of Canada Trust which was still open. They both put on masks. Jones had the gun and said: &quot;This is a stick up.&quot; When a teller appeared to press an alarm, Jones shot and killed him. Jones and Smith fled.
<P>
The police later found Smith in the back of a laneway near the Trust Company. He was babbling incomprehensibly. They took him to the Kingston Mental Health Centre for a mental examination. Smith told the psychiatrist in charge the whole story. The psychiatrist passed this information on to the police, indicating that in his view Smith was, and is, a certifiably insane schizophrenic. The police then arrested Smith and later found and arrested Jones. While arresting Jones they find the gun that killed the teller between two mattresses. Jones says to the police, before any
warning can be given: &quot;It's obvious I shot the teller.&quot; Apparently the identification evidence against Jones and Smith at the Trust Company is weak. Both are charged with first degree murder for both deaths. Jones and Smith are denied bail and lodged in cells separated by a cell occupied by an undercover police officer. Jones is heard by the officer to say: &quot;If we stick together, they won't be able to pin anything on us.&quot;
<P>
You are an articling student with the Kingston Crown attorney assigned to the case. Smith's lawyer has offered to plead guilty to manslaughter for the murder at Canada Trust if all other charges are dropped. Jones' lawyer has offered to plead guilty to manslaughter for both killings if all other charges are dropped. Write a memo advising whether the Crown should accept the proposals.
<P><br>
<b>2. (30 marks approx. 55 minutes)</b> Assume that the Federal Government has just passed the &quot;Cattle
Preservation Act&quot; in response to fears about mad cow disease. One of its provisions states that &quot;No person shall import cattle or cattle products from the United Kingdom or any country added by regulation without a permit from the Minister of Agriculture.&quot; The offence is punishable by summary conviction and a person is liable to 6 months imprisonment and/or a fine of $10,000. Another section states that &quot;lack of knowledge that cattle products are involved is no defence to a charge under the Act.&quot;
<P>
Eatons Ltd. brought in a number of cattle products from the U.K. without a permit and the persons who placed the order and Eatons have been charged with a number of offences under the Act.
<P>
The manager of the cosmetics section for the Toronto area purchased face cream from Scotland which contained animal products. He says he had no idea that they contained animal products and didn't think to ask.
<P>
The manager of the food section for Quebec imported some frozen beef from Scotland. He had phoned Agriculture Canada and had been told by the official he happened to speak to that frozen products are not included in the ban. This was wrong. Frozen products are clearly included.
<P>
The manager of the Vancouver canned goods department had imported cans of beef stew from England. He had called one of the Eatons' company lawyers who advised him that canned goods were excluded from the ban. Again, this was wrong. Canned goods are included.
<P>
The manager of the Calgary store brought in beef products from Malta, which had been added to the list by regulation. The regulation had been published in the Canada Gazette, but because of a postal strike the Canada Gazette had not yet been mailed out.
<P>
The Cattle Preservation Act gives agricultural of finials wide powers of inspection. It states: &quot;An inspector can enter any place of business during regular hours and seize any products that the inspector suspects may have been obtained in violation of the Act.&quot; This is how all four alleged violations were uncovered.
<P>
Eatons Ltd. and the four managers have been charged with violating the Act. You are a young lawyer in the Eatons legal department. Prepare a brief memo on the liability of Eatons and the four managers under the Act.
<P><br>
<b>3. (25 marks approx. 45 minutes)</b> You are a student just completing first year law school and have been given a summer position with Allan Rock, the Minister of Justice. The Minister has been asked to address the Annual Meeting of the Canadian Bar Association in August on &quot;New Directions in Criminal Justice&quot; and has asked you to prepare brief notes on <b>each</b> of the following three topics:
<blockquote>
(A) Codification of the Criminal Law: Where is it going?;<br>
(B) First Degree Murder: Some New Ideas?; and<br>
(C) Simplifying the Classification of Offences.
</blockquote>
Please prepare a draft for discussion purposes with the Minister. You should include ideas that <b>you</b> think he should consider adopting.
<P><br>
A <b>bonus mark</b> will be given to you if you can identify two of the following characters:
<blockquote>
(A) Pierre Couchard;<br>
(B) Blanche Burns; and<br>
(C) Ruby Collins.

<h3>1.</h3>
Section 740 of the Code states:
<blockquote>
An accused who is bound by a probation order and who wilfully fails or refuses to comply with that order is guilty of an offense.....
</blockquote>
Last year, Thomas Jefferson, was convicted of theft under $6,000 and was put on probation. One condition of the probation order was that he &quot;keep the peace and refrain from the commission of any criminal offence&quot;.
<P>
Two months ago, Jefferson was convicted of the sexual assault of a thirteen year old girl whom he had met at a party. At his trial, the Crown conceded that the girl had consented to the sexual activity in question and Jefferson's defence was that he thought she was over fourteen years of age. In convicting him, the trial judge stated:
<blockquote>
I am not saying that I believe the accused when he says that he thought the victim was over fourteen, but his evidence does lead me to have a reasonable doubt about it. Unfortunately for him, this makes no difference, since, whether he believed it or not, he fell far short of taking all reasonable steps to ascertain her true age as is required under S. 150.1(4) -- he merely accepted her word for it even though she was obviously very young and some
further enquiry would have been entirely reasonable. The fact that the accused was unaware of this requirement, is neither here nor there. I therefore convict the accused, but in the circumstances a fine of $500 will be sufficient.
</blockquote>
Jefferson has now been charged with wilfully breaching the probation
order. Is he guilty?
<P><br>
<h3>2.</h3>
Mrs. Rosemary Bomba, a petite woman of 45, was sitting in a booth at the Xippo Dunkin Donut one day last winter having some coffee when she heard two men (since identified as John and Rob) in the booth next to her talking. She was concealed from their view and heard one say to the other, &quot;It's agreed then. He has to be liquidated. How are we going to do it?&quot; and the other one reply, &quot;He keeps his car in the driveway. It'd be easy enough to go over tomorrow night and cut the brake cable and then when he goes round Satan's Corner, wham, over the cliff
he goes&quot;. &quot;Fine,&quot; replied the first one. &quot;What's the address?&quot; To her amazement, Mrs. Bomba heard the reply, &quot;1745 Republic Crescent&quot; which was her address and she realized that they had been talking about her husband.
<P>
Now it so happened that Mrs. Bomba had been thinking for some time about the million dollar insurance policy on her husband's life and had been wondering how to get her hands on it, so she decided to say nothing, waited until the men had left and then went home. She said nothing to her husband when he came back from work and, indeed, unknown to her husband watched from an upstairs window and saw John and Rob come up the driveway that night and tamper with her husband's car.
<P>
Next morning, to her distress, at 9 am., when she asked Mr. Bomba why he hadn't left for work by then, he replied that he had told Paul Freen, their next door neighbour that he could borrow his car for the day and that he wouldn't be going to work that day. &quot;In fact&quot;, said Mr. Bomba, &quot;He'll be over in half an hour&quot;. Mrs. Bomba, fearing more from exposure than worrying about Freen, decided to say nothing, and, sure enough, Freen got
into the car, drove away, and, wham, over the cliff at Satan's Corner he went.
<P>
Don't ask how, but all these facts are proved by the Crown. In a separate trial, John and Rob have been convicted of the first degree murder of Freen.
<P>
Mrs. Bomba is now charged with the first degree murder of Freen also. Is she guilty? Could she have been charged with anything else?
<P><br>
<h3>3.</h3>
It is now accepted by most, if not all, judges that criminal negligence offences are based upon an objective standard, but there is no agreement on what that objective standard consists of nor how to define it. Why is there this disagreement? What are the points of contention and what do you think the standard should be?
<P><br>
<h3>4.</h3>
Section 33.1 now reads:
<blockquote>
(1) It is not a defense to an offence referred to in subsection (3) that the accused, by reason of selfinduced intoxication, lacked the general intent or the voluntariness required to commit the offence, where the accused has departed markedly from the standard of care as described in subsection (2).
<P>
(2) For the purposes of this section, a person departs markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society and is thereby criminally at fault where the person, while in a state of self-induced intoxication that renders the person unaware of, or incapable of consciously controlling, their behaviour, voluntarily or involuntarily interferes or threatens to interfere with the bodily integrity of another person.
<P>
(3) This section applies in respect of an offence under this Act or any other Act of Parliament that includes as an element an assault or any other interference or threat of interference by a person with the bodily integrity of another person.
</blockquote>
Last summer, Jason Picard, an eighteen year old youth, won $10,000 in Lotto 649 and invited several of his friends over to celebrate. Jason has led a sheltered life and his only previous experience with alcohol has been one glass of champagne at his parents' With wedding anniversary celebration. That night he drank more than he had ever had before. Most of the guests left at midnight, but Lisa Fulbright, a seventeen year old friend of his, stayed behind
to help clear up. Moments later, Jason tried to rape her. He says (and his defence is well supported by medical evidence) that he was blind drunk at the time and completely unconscious of anything he was doing and remembers nothing until he woke up in the police station next morning.
<P>
He is now charged with the sexual assault of Lisa. You are his defence counsel. What submissions would you make in his defence?

April 1996<br>
Mr. Murphy</h2></center>
<h3>Note:</h3>
<blockquote>
This is a 24 hour take home exam. It must be picked up between 9:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. or 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday to Thursday from April 11th to April 25th, 1996. You may refer only to the materials for the course (the casebooks and the documents distributed in class) and your class notes. The purpose of the take home format is <b>not</b> to encourage lengthy responses but to give you an opportunity to provide organized, thoughtful and succinct analyses of the issues raised in each question.
<P>
Your responses to both questions 1 and 2 should not in aggregate exceed 3,000 words.
<P>
Your answers to Questions 1 and 2 are each worth 1/2 of your grade.
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>QUESTION 1</h3>

With reference to the law and economics theory of agency, please identify and analyze different ways in which creditors and borrowers in their negotiations with one another in the marketplace, and courts (when litigation arises), have attempted to deal with the inherent conflicts between shareholders, directors/firm managers and creditors (secured and unsecured) of a corporation.
<P>
Explain how, in your view, each of those entities have, or have not, contributed to the rational control of those conflicts.
<P><br>
<h3>QUESTION 2</h3>

To what extent, if at all, in your view do the federal statutory regimes for corporate debt reorganization in Canada (the <cite>Companies Creditors Arrangement Act</cite> and the <cite>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</cite>) adequately protect the respective interests of secured creditors, unsecured creditors and shareholders of an insolvent
corporation (i.e. with assets, the realizable value of which are insufficient to repay in full the investments of each of those stakeholders). To the extent that you feel there are any general inadequacies in those regimes, please explain how you think those inadequacies could be solved.

</ol>
<hr>
<P>
<h3>Part A - EC Legal Order</h3>
<b>Answer one of the following questions:</b>
<ol>
<li>&quot;The EC legal order has promoted the integration of the European Community by ensuring the consistent application of EC law across the Member States.&quot; Discuss the validity of this statement with reference to both the caselaw of the European Court of Justice and the EC Treaty.
<P>
<li>Explain why the doctrine of direct effect developed, as well as the conditions and limitations for applying this doctrine through reference to EC jurisprudence. How has the European Court of Justice been able to overcome some of these conditions and limitations?
</ol><P>
<h3>Part B - Free Movement of Goods</h3>
<b>Answer the following question:</b>
<ol>
<li>(a) Your client, &Eacute;lan, is a French manufacturer and distributor who is in the business of selling &Eacute;lan beauty and cosmetic products door to door. &Eacute;lan products are not available in shops; indeed, the personalized attention that door to door selling brings is seen as part of the &quot;cachet&quot; or special characteristic of the &Eacute;lan line of products. &Eacute;lan has been selling its products throughout the European Union. Recently, the Italian government has passed legislation that bans door to door selling, because it is concerned with undue pressure that may be brought to bear on consumers when the seller is in their homes. The Italian Cosmetics and Perfume Association, a trade association of major cosmetic dealers, lobbied in favour of this change as it will not affect its members who do not sell door to door. &Eacute;lan has complained to the European Commission that the new Italian law violates the principle of free movement of goods.
<P>
With reference to the case law of the European Court of Justice, advise &Eacute;lan on whether the European Commission would succeed in challenging the Italian law under Article 30.
<P>
(b) The Spanish Government has also introduced new legislation to regulate animal by-products in cosmetics, particularly handcreams and lotions. It claims that certain types of boviline, a by-product of cows, may be harmful to the health of its consumers, and therefore has established a licensing procedure whereby only particular types of boviline will be allowed. Based on your knowledge of EC caselaw, what conditions would the Spanish Government's boviline licensing procedure have to meet under Article 30?
</ol>
<h3>Part C - EC Competition Law</h3>
<b>Answer one of the following questions:</b>
<ol>
<li>The European Commission has hired you as outside legal counsel. Compex, a German manufacturer of computer software, has recently decided to increase its sales into the rest of the European Union. Its software has never penetrated the rest of the EU because governments of other Member States have in the past promoted their own computer software firms through various means of dubious legality under EC law (which you do not have to address). Such promotion has now ceased but Compex faces stiff competition from finds in other EU Member States as a result.
<blockquote>
(a) Compex has entered into distribution agreements with resellers in other Member States which require the resellers to buy all of their requirements only from Compex. An exclusive Compex distributor has been appointed
for each Member State. Compex has told the Commission that each distributor will be required to invest heavily in a highly trained sales force and in promotion. Each distribution agreement prohibits exports from the European Union and prohibits each distributor from actively seeking markets in other Member States but, subject to paragraph (b), permits distributors to respond to orders from customers from other Member States.
<P>
 (b) A new clause has been inserted into Compex's agreement with its German distributors which permits exports from Germany to other Member States only after the software has been on the German market for at least two years.
Since most software becomes obsolete within this period, this clause acts as an effective export ban. Compex has stated that this clause is necessary because Compex software prices in Germany are much lower (where the product
is well known) than what will be charged by distributors in other Member States who will have to recoup the costs of training and promotion.
</blockquote>
Advise the European Commission on the legality of the distribution agreements described in (a) and (b) under Article 85.
<P>
<li>Cacao, a Dutch manufacturer of chocolate developed a new diet chocolate (&quot;Chocolite&quot;) which has taken the Netherlands by storm. The recipe is protected under the Netherlands's intellectual property laws. In the trade, Cacao is said to have &quot;recipe rights&quot; to the diet chocolate; this right means that Cacao has the exclusive right to manufacture and sell this chocolate in the Netherlands. Chocolite now has approximately 60% of diet chocolate sales in the Netherlands and a much lower share (35%) in the European Union (&quot;EU&quot;) as a whole. Among consumers of all types of chocolate, Chocolite has a Dutch market share of approximately 25 % and an EU market share of less than 5 % .
<P>
In order to encourage sales of Chocolite across the EU, Cacao has engaged in the practice of providing discounts at the end of the year to customers who buy a range of chocolate products from it, including Chocolite. Distributors who do not buy all or a large proportion of their chocolate requirements from Cacao do not receive the discount or rebate at the end of the year. In addition, Cacao has just introduced a clause whereby it has the option to meet a lower price offered to its distributor or to release the customer to buy from another manufacturer.
<P>
Recently, Sweet Tooth, a UK chocolate manufacturer, has developed a diet chocolate that has virtually the same recipe as Chocolite. Sweet Tooth wishes to export the chocolate into the other Member States, but has been advised by Cacao's solicitors that Cacao will invoke its &quot;recipe rights&quot; to keep Sweet Tooth's diet chocolate out of the market.
<P>
You have been retained by Cacao to provide it with legal advice on the legality of its actions under Article 86 of the EC Treaty. What do you advise?

James DeWitt, aged 28, is charged with the first degree murder of Charles Link, aged 6. Link had been sexually assaulted and strangled. DeWitt's defence is simply that he did not do it and the Crown evidence against him is mostly circumstantial. DeWitt has a mental age of fourteen and for that reason, he was remanded for psychiatric examination by Dr. Pauling who, however, reported that he was fit to stand trial. DeWitt's lawyer also arranged for him to be examined by Dr. Linus who also reported that DeWitt was fit to stand trial. No issue as to this arises.
<P>
However, Dr. Pauling's report states, in part:
<blockquote>
DeWitt exhibits clear symptoms of a sadistic, homosexual paedophile. In my opinion, he is quite capable of committing the murder with which he is charged and is extremely dangerous. I have no doubt at all that he is responsible for Link's death.
</blockquote>
On the other hand, Dr. Linus' report states, in part:
<blockquote>
In my opinion, DeWitt is sexually immature, but, apart from that, exhibits no abnormal tendencies. I consider he is quite incapable of committing the murder with which he is charged but is, on the contrary, a gentle and timid individual who represents no danger to society.
</blockquote>
DeWitt does have two previous convictions, neither involving violence -- one for theft under $5,000 and one for break and enter with intent to commit theft.
<P>
DeWitt testified, and in response to a question from his counsel as to whether he killed Link, stated:
<blockquote>
I did not. I wouldn't do such a thing. I've never harmed anyone in my life.
</blockquote>
Would you permit the Crown, in the first instance, to call Dr. Pauling as a witness for the prosecution to testify in accordance with his report, or any part of it? Would you permit the defense, in the first instance, to call Dr. Linus to testify in accordance with his report or any part of it? If either is permitted, would you permit the other to call his witness in rebuttal? Given DeWitt's answer above, does this make any difference? Would you permit the Crown to introduce evidence of DeWitt's prior convictions and, if so, for what purpose?
<P><br>

The accused, Henry Sweet, aged 29, is on trial for the first degree murder of Paul Sour, aged 27, who had been found shot to death in the stairwell of his apartment building last summer. The case against Sweet is based largely on circumstantial evidence, and it is the theory of the Crown that the killing involved a drug deal that had gone wrong. Sweet denied, and so testified, that he had anything to do with the killing, and to make the defence more believable, sought to pin the blame on Patrick Fee. In support of this, he called Fee's wife. She had been interviewed by the police shortly after the body had been found, and had stated to them:
<blockquote>
Patrick didn't come home until late last night. I was worried in case he'd done anything foolish. He told me just before he went out that he was going to get that bastard Sour for stiffing him on their last drug deal, but he told me when he came home that he'd just gone to a movie to cool down.
</blockquote>
She repeated this statement in a videorecording made at the police station, after promising that what she was about to say was the truth. The police thereupon questioned Fee who told them that he had been to see &quot;The Monster Leeches of Planet Phylo&quot; playing at the Cactus Cinema on the night in question, but upon investigation, the police found out that that movie was not playing the night Fee had said he'd seen it, but the week before. However,
after further investigation, the police were satisfied that Fee was not responsible for the killing, after he explained his lie by telling them that he thought they might be after him for a break and enter that had occurred the same night as the killing. In any case, there was more circumstantial evidence against Sweet than against Fee, so the police proceeded against Fee.
<P>
When she was called as a witness for the defense, Fee's wife was asked what Fee had said to her just before she went out. First of all, she refused to answer on the ground of marital privilege, but when ordered to answer by the trial judge, replied: 
<blockquote>
He said that he was going to a movie. He didn't say which one.
</blockquote>
(a) Should her claim of marital privilege have been upheld?
<P>
(b) Assuming the trial judge was right, what, if anything, can Sweet now do about her unhelpful reply?
<P>
(c) Can the defence in any way introduce in evidence the lie that Fee told the police and to what end?
<P><br>

Last summer a fire occurred at the dry-cleaning establishment of Charles Hanley and the fire marshall's office, convinced that the fire had been deliberately set, called in the police. As a result of their investigations, the police came to the conclusion that Charles Hanley had committed arson in order to obtain the insurance on the building, but Hanley had a cast-iron alibi for the night in question and it was clear that he could not have set the fire himself. They sought and obtained a perfectly valid wire-tap authorization to tap Hanley's phone and in the course of so doing, heard one, Larry Finbein, call Hanley as follows: 
<P>
L.F. Well, I done it. What about my ten grand.<br>
C.H. Sure. I've got it here. You can have it next time I see you.<br>
L.F. O.K. Let's meet, usual place, Monday at six.<br>
C.H. O.K.
<P>
Having traced the call, the police had no difficulty picking up Finbein, and took him down to the station. He asked to contact a lawyer, but the police refused until he had answered their questions. After a lengthy interrogation, Finbein finally made, and signed, the following statement:
<P>
<I>I admit that I torched Hanley's dry-cleaning shop. Hanley had nothing to do with it. I did it because he wouldn't pay the protection money I was demanding -- ten thousand dollars in fact. I told him that next time, I'd kill him.</I>
<P>
He was then formally charged with arson and allowed to contact a lawyer. After consulting with his lawyer, Finbein then made a second statement to the police, which he also signed, as follows:
<P>
<I>The first statement I made was untrue. Hanley promised to pay me ten grand if I would torch his business and take full responsibility if the cops found out, but now that I've spoken to my lawyer, I realize that there is no reason why I should carry the can when it was all his idea.</I>
<P>
As a result of this second statement, the police arrested Hanley and charged him with arson. Hanley and Finbein are now jointly on trial. The Crown, realizing that Finbein's statements are inadmissible against him because of the Charter violation, makes no attempt to introduce them, relying instead on various other pieces of evidence the police have collected against the two. Finbein testifies in his own defense and the substance of his testimony is in accordance with his second statement, adding, however that he only went along with it because Hanley was blackmailing him over some other offences he had committed.
<P>
Hanley's counsel (whose defence is going to be along the lines of Finbein's first statement to the police) wishes to cross-examine Finbein on the first statement he made to the police for the truth of it. Crown counsel argues that it is only admissible to show a prior inconsistency. Finbein's counsel objects to its use under any circumstances.
<P>
As the trial judge, how would you rule?
<P><br>
<h3>4.</h3>

You are defence counsel in a sexual assault charge on a 22 year old woman. The Crown, being unaware of the fact, has not told you that she underwent rape trauma therapy after the event, but one of the victim's friends has told you that the victim told her that she had told the therapist during one of the sessions that she may have encouraged the accused into thinking that she was consenting. How do you go about getting hold of the records of the therapy sessions and could you use them at all, and for what purpose even if you did get hold of them?

<b>1.</b> A long time bachelor, Charles met Diana in 1980. Diana was a 19 year old kindergarten teacher; Charles was an &quot;older&quot; man of independent means. After a whirlwind courtship, the two decided to wed. They were married in a fairy-tale like ceremony in July, 1981.
<P>
Before the wedding, Charles and Diana each received gifts from family, friends and other well wishers. Diana received a red sports car from her family worth $25,000. From his family, Charles received two thoroughbred horses (he was very fond of thoroughbreds). The horses were each worth $100,000. Charles' family gave Diana various items of jewellery - including a sparkly tiara - that had been in the family for centuries. This was a very generous gift, the jewellery being valued at $100,000. For their part, Diana's family gave Charles a painting of one of their esteemed ancestors, worth $50,000.
<P>
In addition to these gifts, Charles and Diana each brought other property into the marriage. Diana had a rather extensive wardrobe, valued at $15,000. She also had some antique silver and crystal, worth $50,000.
<P>
Charles' pre-marriage wealth consisted largely of real estate and investments. He had two posh homes - one in the country and one in the city - both impeccably furnished. On the date of marriage, the country home was worth $200,000 and the city home, $300,000. The furniture in the city home was worth $100,000 and that in the country home, worth $50,000. His investments amounted to $500,000.
<P>
During the marriage, Charles and Diana each acquired more property. When Diana gave birth to their first son a year after the marriage, Charles gave her a ring worth $60,000. He also gave her a necklace, worth $40,000, when she gave birth to their second son a few years later. Diana also received a substantial inheritance from her great-uncle. This included a rather lavish country home in the Muskokas worth $500,000, furnishings worth $100,000, and artwork worth $100,000. Finally, throughout the marriage, Diana indulged her passion for personal adornments and acquired an even more extensive wardrobe.
<P>
For his part, Charles acquired more real estate and investments during the marriage. He also received an inheritance from his great-uncle Phillip who left him a country estate worth $500,000 in Collingwood. As Charles and Diana already had two country homes, Charles rented out the estate for $60,000 a year for five years (i.e. a total of $300,000). He deposited this money in a bank account in his name which he labelled the &quot;Collingwood Account&quot;.
<p>
Unfortunately, Charles and Diana were not destined for wedded bliss. As it turned out, Charles and Diana actually had very little in common. Charles, for example, had a passion for polo and for classical architecture. Diana enjoyed popular music, aerobics and expensive clothing. In addition, it turned out that for most of the marriage Charles had been yearning for his pre-marriage sweet heart, Crumelda. To Diana's utter dismay, it also turned out that Charles had been having an extra-marital affair with Crumelda for some time.
<p>
As Diana's unhappiness over Charles' infatuation with Crumelda grew, Charles and Diana began to live increasingly separate lives. By 1990 the two had stopped having meals together, occupied separate bedrooms and no longer had sexual relations with each other. They had also stopped socializing together except for special family occasions. What little communication there was between them was strained, even when it came to matters concerning their children. Finally, in 1994, Diana insisted that Charles move out.
<p>
Diana has now come to you for advice concerning the breakdown of her marriage. At the moment, she does not want your advice on spousal support or child support. Instead, she is primarily concerned about the kind of property settlement she can expect from Charles and about any other matter that might be relevant to her divorce. Diana has provided you with the following financial and personal information regarding her relationship with Charles. <B>She is not sure that all this information is relevant, nor that she has given you all the information you will require.</B>
<p>
<b>Personal Information:</b>
<ol>
<li>Charles' relationship with Crumelda had a profound affect on Diana. She became desperately unhappy to the point of becoming clinically depressed. She also developed an eating disorder which compromised her physical health. Charles knew that his attention to Crumelda harmed Diana both physically and emotionally. Diana believes that Charles delighted in her suffering and that he continued his relationship with Crumelda to spite her.
<p>
<li>Charles feels that Diana did not contribute much to the marriage and that she squandered too much of his money on clothes. He feels that he does not owe Diana anything because Diana was able to acquire far more property during the marriage than she would have been able to on her own.
<p>
<li>Diana agrees that she spent a lot of money on clothing, but claims that she contributed emotionally to the marriage. She notes that neither she nor Charles had to do a lot of work during the marriage since they employed hired help.
</ol>
<b>Financial Information
<p>
Diana's Property</b>
<ol>
<li>Diana still has most, but not all, of the property she owned on the date of marriage. She still has the jewellery she received as an engagement gift which was worth $150,000 in 1994 and is worth $160,000 now. She also has the antique silver and crystal, which were worth $60,000 in 1994 and are worth $65,000 now. She sold the red sports car during the marriage for $15,000 and used the proceeds to buy a black sports car. That car was worth $20,000 in 1994 and is worth $15,000 now. Finally, Diana no longer has any of the clothing she brought into the marriage. She doesn't remember what she did with it but she thinks she gave most of it to Goodwill.
<p>
<li>When she first learned of Charles' affair with Crumelda, Diana decided she could not stand to keep the jewellery Charles gave her. She sold the necklace and the ring for a total of $120,000. She invested the proceeds in bonds which were worth $170,000 in 1994 and are worth $200,000 now.
<p>
<li>Diana retained the lavish country home in the Muskokas. As it was a lovely spot to spend the summer, Charles and Diana spent most of their summers there with their children during the early years of their marriage. When the marriage began to founder, Charles began spending less time at the Muskoka home and more time at his home in Collingwood. By 1994 Charles had stopped coming to the Muskoka home entirely. Diana continues to take the children to the Muskoka home for most of the summer.
<p>
<li>The Muskoka home was worth $600,000 in 1994. Due to an unusual real estate boom in the area, the home has increased dramatically in value and is now worth $1,000,000.
<p>
<li>While Diana kept the Muskoka home, she was not fond of her great-uncle's taste in furniture. She sold the furniture shortly after she inherited it for $100,000. She used this money to buy entirely new furnishings. These have since depreciated in value as a result of the wear and tear inflicted by Diana's two young boys. The furniture was worth $70,000 in 1994 and is worth $50,000 now.
<p>
<li>Diana was also less than thrilled with her great-uncle's taste in art. She immediately sold the artwork she'd inherited for $100,000. She used this money to open up bank accounts for the two boys and deposited $50,000 in each account. By 1994 each account contained $75,000; there is now $80,000 in each account.
<p>
<li>Diana's wardrobe was valued at $30,000 in 1994. As she now has fewer clothes, her wardrobe is valued at $20,000.
</ol>
<b>Charles' Property</b>
<ol>
<li>Like Diana, Charles has also retained some of the property he owned before the marriage. He still has the painting of Diana's esteemed ancestor. It was worth $70,000 in 1994 and is worth $75,000 now. Charles also retained the city home and continued to live in it until Diana asked him to leave in 1994. The city home was worth $400,000 in 1994 and is worth the same now. The furniture in the home was worth $80,000 in 1994 and is worth $75,000 now. Finally, Charles also retained his pre-marriage investments which have proven very profitable. They were worth $1,000,000 in 1994 and are worth $1,200,000 now.
<p>
<li>Two years after the marriage, Charles sold the country home he had brought into the marriage for $225,000. He used the proceeds to buy a new country home which he and his family could use for ski holidays in the winter. Charles, Diana and the boys continued to spend time there until 1994 (although after 1990 Charles and Diana often went to the house at different times). The home was worth $250,000 in 1994 and is worth $260,000 now. The furniture in the new country home was worth $60,000 in 1994 and is worth $50,000 now.
<p>
<li>The thoroughbred horses Charles brought into the marriage have, unfortunately, long since been put out to pasture.
<p>
<li>The country house inherited from Great-Uncle Phillip was worth $800,000 in 1994 and is worth roughly the same now. After renting out the house for five years, Charles decided to evict his tenants and to spend time at the house himself. From 1990 on, Charles would frequently retreat to his Collingwood house when Diana and the children went to Diana's house in the Muskokas. Diana never visited the Collingwood house and the children visited only rarely.
<p>
<li>The &quot;Collingwood Account&quot; contained $340,000 in 1994. Now it contains $350,000.
</ol>
Prepare an opinion for Diana explaining how the property issues between herself and Charles would be resolved under the <cite>Family Law Act</cite>. As Diana is not a mathematical whiz, she wants you to explain clearly how the NFP calculation would be done. She does, however, want some sense of the numbers, so she would like you to attempt to do the calculation. Your opinion should also include discussion of other issues relevant to Diana's divorce, EXCEPT for spousal support and child support.
<p>
If you feel that Diana has not provided you with sufficient information about her marriage or her finances, you are free to make assumptions as long as you indicate where you are doing so.
<p><br>
<h3>2. CHOOSE <U>ONE</U> OF THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS:</h3>

(a) In <cite>Moge v. Moge</cite>, the Supreme Court of Canada appears to have endorsed a modified compensatory model of spousal support. Drawing upon your materials and classroom discussion, comment on this model of spousal support. What are the strengths of the approach? What are its weaknesses or limitations? In answering this question, you will want to compare the compensatory approach with other philosophies of spousal support. You might also wish to consider whether there are other ways of thinking about the spousal support obligation.
<p>
<center><h3>OR</h3></center>

(b) Comment on the decision in <cite>Leek v. Lightfoot</cite>. Is the decision a good one? Is it consistent with the philosophy of spousal support articulated in <cite>Moge v. Moge</cite>?
<p><br>
<h3>3. CHOOSE <U>ONE</U> OF THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS:</h3>

a) For some time, the Ontario Government has been considering whether it should amend the <cite>Family Law Act</cite>. The government has hired you as a consultant. They want your opinion concerning which aspects of the Act should be changed and which should be retained. They have given you free reign to consider everything in the Act - including, the rules regarding property division and the principles for granting spousal support. They also want your opinion on whether there are any areas which the Act does not address but which a new (and improved) family law statute would cover.
<p>
<center><h3>OR</h3></center>

b) Does matrimonial fault have a place in contemporary family law? If so, how should fault matter? To answer this question, you will want to provide a brief overview of the history of fault in family law, and to discuss the role of fault in family law today.

<p>
<b>1.</b> Fred Farmer IV is the great grandson of Fred Farmer I, the founder of <cite>Farmer's Choice</cite>, a well-known producer of fine jams and preserves in Eastern Ontario. What had begun as a simple Ma and Pa homestead operation had evolved, over the years, into a bustling enterprise of almost 100 employees, distributed across a farming operation (40 labourers), a processing plant (35 workers), a trucking service (10 drivers), and a small administrative and sales office (of 5-6 people).
<P>
On the whole life had been good for Fred and <cite>Farmer's Choice</cite>. Company sales grew over time and the only cloud in the picture was the increasing attention their success attracted among competitors and in the trade union community. Once their company became better known, several unions had put out feelers to the workers and in December 1993 the Teamsters had succeeded in organizing Fred's drivers. On February 15, 1994 Fred signed a standard, two-year collective agreement with the Teamsters which guaranteed, among other things, (1) that he retained exclusive authority to manage the business as he saw fit unless the Agreement specifically provided otherwise and (2) that all employees would work a forty-hour week.
<P>
In December 1995 Farmer and the Teamsters began negotiating a new collective agreement in a spirit of optimism and good will. However, relations soured as bargaining progressed and broke down completely when, at the middle of January, the company unilaterally instituted two important policy initiatives. First Fred announced that, owing to changes in harvesting practices, the regular schedule of work for everyone (labourers, plant and office workers as well as the drivers) would be pushed ahead four hours. As of the first of February all workers would start at noon and finish at 9:00 p.m. with an unpaid hour off for dinner. Secondly, Farmer told his workers that the company was installing hidden cameras in the plant and on the premises after it had discovered several marijuana plants growing in one of its hothouses.
<P>
Practically everyone who worked for the company was opposed to the changes. Labourers, plant workers, drivers and office staff alike all protested at having to work into the evening and at being subjected to surveillance by hidden cameras. Three of the drivers in particular, Anwar Ali, Betty Bible, and Charlie Christian - were especially incensed about the change in their hours because their religious beliefs prohibited them from doing any work after
sundown on Fridays. When Ali, Bible and Christian told Fred of their personal circumstances, the latter replied that it would be impossible to create special schedules for them and that he would have to fire them and replace them with people who could work a full forty-hour week. 
<P>
When conciliation collapsed, and with the anger of the workers at a fever pitch, the Teamsters called a strike for the first of March. The attitude of both sides was ugly. The Teamsters put pickets in front of the plant, at all the other roads that accessed Fred's farm, and even in front of the properties of other farmers who sold fruits and berries to Fred. As well, they initiated a consumer boycott by picketing all the local stores in the area that carried Farmer's choice products.
<P>
For his part, Fred hit back by recruiting replacement workers with promises that if they guaranteed they would work a full forty-hour week on the new schedule they would be given extra seniority rights that would ensure they would not be laid off at the end of the strike. Fred was able to attract seven drivers in this way, including two Doug Doublecross and Ernie Egoist - who were part of the group that had gone out on strike, but who had opposed the union and the idea of collective bargaining right from the beginning.
<P>
As spring arrived, the pressure on both sides to reach a settlement increased. Farmer's Choice would be ruined if the strike interfered with the planting season and the drivers were feeling the pinch of having had no paychecks for over a month. Indeed, several of them, including Gord Gettaway, Harry Haulage and Ivan Itinerant, had family members who worked either in the plant or in the fields, who had felt compelled to respect the drivers' picket line, and so they had lost two incomes instead of one.
<P>
Fred has come to you for advice. Before he makes a settlement with the union, he wants to know precisely what his legal situation is with respect to all of the events (and all of the workers) that have occurred up until now. In addition, he wants to know what he should make of a proposal the Teamsters have put forward in which, in  exchange for the union agreeing not to grieve the dismissals of Ali, Bible and Christian and allowing Doublecross
and Egoist to retain their jobs, Fred would be obliged to deduct the amount of money Doublecross and Egoist had earned by working during the strike and remit it to the union. According to the Teamsters, the forfeiture of earnings made by workers who cross its picket lines is part of their constitution and binds all of their members.
<P>
Finally Fred advises you that he has been thinking a lot, in the last little while, about the possibility of expanding the processing part of his operation and moving it closer to the Niagara Peninsula where he would have easier access to a much larger crop. The idea of moving also appeals to Fred because he believes it would make it less likely that the Teamsters would be able to continue their efforts to organize the workers in the plant that they had initiated during the course of the drivers' strike.
<P>
Advise Fred what his legal rights and obligations are not only with respect to the drivers and their union but with regard to his other workers as well.

<h3>QUESTIONS ONE AND TWO (45 MARKS TOTAL!</h3>

In 1980 Albert bought a large 4-bedroom house in the Annex area of Toronto from Bob. A few months before the purchase Bob and a few of his neighbours noticed that a house a few blocks away had recently been bought by a charitable organisation and converted for use as a hospice for AIDS sufferers. (A hospice is a home for the destitute or sick). Bob and six of his neighbours, fearful of and ignorant about AIDS, agreed that if any of them sold their houses they would stipulate that the houses were not to be used as AIDS hospices. Having also noticed that another house in the neighbourhood was rather run-down in appearance, they also decided to try to make future purchasers conform to what they saw as the neighbourhood standard of appearance and maintenance. Thus the conveyance to Albert contained a short covenant, which read in its entirety as follows:
<P>
The grantee promises, covenants and agrees, to and with the grantor and his heirs and assigns, with the intention that the same shall run with the land and be binding upon all subsequent owners;
<P>
Firstly, that the land is not to be used for the purpose of a hospice for AIDS patients or for any similar purpose;
<P>
Secondly, that the dwelling house on the land is to be maintained in good appearance and the yard in neat order. No prefabricated or temporary structures shall be erected in the yard;
<P>
Thirdly, that any conveyance of the land hereafter shall be subject to the above restrictions.
<P>
The covenant was registered with the other documents conveying title to Albert. Albert lived in the house until 1985, and then sold it to Charlotte. Charlotte's lawyer told her that there was a restrictive covenant attached to the land, but as she did not intend to do anything but live in the house for the rest of her life she didn't care. Early last year Charlotte received a promotion that required her to move to Vancouver for five years. Not wishing to sell the house in a depressed Toronto real estate market, she decided to rent it out. She did not want to rent it for residential
purposes, preferring that it be occupied for some form of business. She made an agreement with Helping Hand  (SEW, an AIDS-related charity that wanted to expand its hospice facilities. She knew exactly why HH wanted to rent the house, and her lawyer assured her, <b>correctly</b> that Part IV of the <cite>Landlord and Tenant Act</cite> did not apply to such a use.
<P>
The lease with HH was for a five-year period, starting 1 July 1995. Almost immediately after HH moved in Darren, one of the neighbours who knew about the covenant, called his old friend Bob and told him what had happened. Bob then called Charlotte and complained about the use to which her house was being put. He was also annoyed that the house had not been painted for a while and that HH had put up a shed for storing bicycles in the yard. Charlotte refused to do anything, so Bob sued and at trial won a judgment that
<P>
(a) the covenant was a valid restrictive covenant that ran with the land and was enforceable against Charlotte as a successor-in-title to Albert, and
<P>
(b) that Bob was entitled to an injunction barring HH from using the house as a hospice, requiring HH or Charlotte to remove the shed, and also requiring Charlotte to have the house painted.
<P>
The judgment and accompanying injunction were issued on February 1st, 1996.
<P>
<b>QUESTION ONE. You are Charlotte's lawyer, and believe the trial judgment to be wrong. You know there was notice of the covenant through registration, but you don't believe it is enforceable against Charlotte. In response to the Ontario government's pledge to speed up justice, the Court of Appeal has introduced a scheme whereby appeals may be &quot;fast-tracked&quot; in appropriate circumstances. Counsel who want a quick hearing must submit a
memorandum on why they have a strong case and ought to be heard soon. For 20 MARKS, and in 35 minutes, please write that memorandum.</b>
<P><br>
When the injunction was served on HH, they consulted lawyers (Osgoode Hall graduates) who told them they could leave because Charlotte had broken her contract with them; she knew they wanted the house for a hospice and had rented them one that she knew or ought to have known could not be used for that purpose. HH told Charlotte about this advice, and in response Charlotte wrote to them as follows:
<P>
&quot;I am going to take the case about the covenant to the Court of Appeal. I understand that you are frustrated at not being able to use the house for a while, but I would prefer you not to leave the house unoccupied. I am willing to forgive the rent until we get the matter sorted out. If you feel you must leave, I am also willing to try to find another tenant for a short term, and you can come back when it's all sorted out&quot;.
<P>
HH were not persuaded to stay, and at the end of March 1996 left owing one month's rent, that for March. Charlotte was soon able to get another tenant. The rent was much lower than that which had been paid by HH, largely because the tenant agreed with Charlotte that it would leave immediately when asked. As Charlotte explained to the new tenant when they met to sign a lease: &quot;I'm just doing this to cover myself until I get the injunction lifted,
at which time HH can come back&quot;.
<P>
<b>QUESTION TWO. Charlotte is concerned about the precise nature of her rights and obligations vis-a-vis HH. For 25 MARKS, and taking 45 minutes, please explain to her exactly what her legal position is in relation to HH, and advise her what to do now.</b>
<P><br>
<h3>QUESTION 1TIREE - 30 MARKS</h3>
<P>
The recently-elected government of Flavelle, a province of Canada with laws identical to those of Ontario, has enacted a <cite>Flavelle Bill of Rights</cite> which includes the following provision:
<P>
&quot;Every resident of Flavelle has the right to the full and absolute enjoyment of rights of property of all kinds, and the right not to be deprived of property without just compensation &quot;
<P>
This was a measure dear to the heart of the Flavelle premier, Golf Pro, as was another piece of legislation, the <cite>Landlords' Protection Act</cite>. This act repealed all rent control legislation in Flavelle as well as Part IV of the existing <cite>Landlord and Tenant Act.</cite>
<P>
In a busy legislative session the legislature also passed another Act, the <cite>Heritage Golf Courses Preservation Act.</cite> This was a response to the fact that the land on which the Glenn Abbey golf course was laid out had been bought from the Glenn Abbey Golf Club by Disney Corporation. Soon after the purchase Disney announced that it intended to close the course and to build a Disney theme park on the land. Many members of the Flavelle cabinet were appalled at the possible destruction of one of Canada's finest golf courses, and at the loss of revenue
from the inevitable cancellation of the Canadian Open golf tournament, played at Glenn Abbey. The <cite>Heritage Golf Courses Preservation Act</cite> stipulated that certain golf courses in the province, including Glenn Abbey, were &quot;heritage golf courses&quot; and the land on which a &quot;heritage golf course&quot; stood could not be used for any other purpose. The <cite>Act</cite> contained no provision for the awarding of compensation.
<P>
Shortly after all this legislation was passed Disney sued the government, arguing that it should be compensated for the lost opportunity to develop the land. It based its claim on the common law and on the newly-enacted Flavelle <cite>Bill of Rights.</cite> At about the same time a tenants' rights organisation, the Flavelle Tenants Association, also sued the government, arguing that the <cite>Landlords' Protection Act</cite> was both a violation of the Flavelle <cite>Bill of Rights</cite> and unconstitutional under the <cite>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</cite> Since both actions involved interpretation of the Flavelle <cite>Bill of Rights,</cite> they were

<h3>Question 1</h3>

The Attorney General of Ontario has decided to initiate a review of property law in the province. As part of this process you have been asked to write a memorandum on the reform of the law relating to circumstances in which the defeasible fees are struck down. The Attorney General is particularly interested in your assessment of whether the law should remain as it is or whether it should be reformed. You should assume that the Attorney General knows
very little about property law. Therefore, he is particularly interested in your reasoning.
<P><br>
<h3>Question 2</h3>

Oscar owns a new luxury residential apartment building in Toronto. The building has a doorman who announces visitors to tenants and keeps out the uninvited. Unfortunately, the doorman persistently admitted canvassers who annoyed the tenants. One day he even admitted two large men posing as movers who made off with most of Jane's
furniture. Jane has demanded that Oscar pay her the replacement value of her furniture and fire the doorman. Oscar has refused both demands. He has pointed out to Jane a clause in her lease relieving the landlord of responsibility for damages suffered by tenants. He has also refused to fire the doorman who is his father
<P>
To make matters worse, the child of another tenant has broken the washing and drying machines. Oscar refuses to do anything about the washing and drying machines claiming that he is not at fault.
<P>
Jane went on an extended business trip and allowed a lawyer friend of hers to use the apartment. He was careless about where he threw his food and bugs appeared in the apartment. Jane moved back in. For the last several months, due to the facts already mentioned, Jane has refused to pay rent. Yesterday she moved out and mailed Oscar the keys. Oscar has written to her indicating that he will hold her responsible for both past and future rent and any other
damages that he may claim.
<P>
Discuss the legal issues raised by these facts.
<P><br>
<h3>Question 3</h3>

L and T enter into a written three-year lease of a suite in L's building in Toronto. T was a dentist, so he extracted a covenant from L that the suite could be used in the practice of dentistry. T covenanted to pay rent and not to assign or sublet any part of the premises without leave in writing by L.
<P>
During the first year of the lease L carried out an extensive scheme of remodelling the interior of the building. No work was done within the suite leased to T. but noise, dampness, dust, obstruction of hallways, and interruptions of
the supply of water and electricity substantially interfered with T's practice and injured his equipment to some extent. At first T protested to L and when L refused to have the work stopped, T ceased paying rent and moved out, taking his equipment with him. Three months later, when L had finished making the alterations to the building, T asked L for permission to assign the balance of the term to S. an architect. L refused to consent to the assignment.
L is an architect himself and he has his offices in the building. T gave S the key to the suite anyway and S moved in one weekend while L was out of town. The day after S moved into the suite (sometime in late January) it began to snow. Unfortunately S had left a window open and so much snow fell inside the suite that the hardwood floor was ruined. When L came back to Toronto a few days later, he immediately sued T for arrears of rent, damages for breach of the covenant not to assign without leave and for the cost of having a new hardwood floor installed in the suite.
<P>
Advise T as to his legal position.

<h3>Question 1</h3>

Jill, an accountant, owned an office building on Bloor Street. She leased a suite in the building to Ken for a term of 3 years. Since Jill practised accountancy in the same building, she and Ken agreed that Ken could not use the office he rented for the purpose of an accountancy practise. Ken also covenanted not to part with possession of the premises without Jill's permission. Shortly thereafter, Jill sold the building to Ann and moved her practise.
<P>
A few months later Ken rented space in his premises in the building to Barbara a well known tax accountant. Ken did not seek Ann's permission for his transaction, nor did Ann know about it. Ann was not a very efficient manager and failed to pay the electrical bills for the building on time. Ken and Barbara found it difficult to carry on their businesses because the electric power to the offices was often shut off.
<P>
Ann had trouble getting tenants to fill the other offices in the building. In desperation, she rented space for a body rub parlous This had a very detrimental effect on Ken's business. Ken complained bitterly about the body rub parlour but Ann refused to do anything about it. Ken then withheld the rent for the past two months. Ann has just found out about Barbara's presence in the building.
<P>
The rental market has just improved dramatically. Ann has now brought an action for possession against Ken. There is a clause in the lease allowing the landlord to terminate the lease if the tenant is in breach of any covenants.
<P>
What disposition would you make of the issues involved? Point out and argue briefly for any reforms in the law whose necessity you think is indicated by these facts.
<P><br>

<p>
<h3>PART ONE (3 QUESTIONS)</h3>
 
 <b>Part One is worth a total of 80 marks. Suggested time for the entire part is 2 hours and 25 minutes. The facts for this Part are cumulative: each question is based on all the facts given up to that point. Where a name is followed by an abbreviation in parentheses, you may for convenience substitute the abbreviation for the full name.</b>
<p>
The states of Evokia (&quot;E&quot;) and Forgettia (&quot;F&quot;) face each other across a 200 mile channel connecting the Seas of Memor and Oblivion. Both states claim sovereignty over the small island of Amnesia (&quot;A&quot;), which lies 30 miles off the Forgettian coast.
<p>
Evokia is not a party to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (&quot;UNCLOS&quot;). Forgettia has signed the UNCLOS and is preparing to declare an Exclusive Economic Zone (&quot;EEZ&quot;) that would encompass
 Amnesia. This prospect has led to a patriotic frenzy in both states, and a sudden chill in the relations between Evokia and Forgettia.
<p>
 In 1720, a team of cartographers charged with mapping the possessions of the King of Evokia discovered the island of Amnesia and included it on an official map. Apart from a flag and a stone marker, they left no trace behind. So far as the cartographers could determine, Amnesia, a rocky and forbidding isle, had never been inhabited. There is no evidence that it has been inhabited since.
<p>
From about 1820 on, both Evokia and Forgettia routinely made a number of their legislative acts applicable to the island. In many of its bilateral commercial treaties, Forgettia, with the concurrence of the other state party, stipulated that the treaty shall not apply to Amnesia. In the late nineteenth century, Forgettian botanists visited Amnesia and made a record of the types of flora unique to the island. The record is now part of the archives of the Forgettian Museum of Natural History. In the same period, Forgettia built a lighthouse on Amnesia. The lighthouse has not functioned for over half a century. Forgettia has continuously maintained buoys and other nautical  markers  off the coast of the island.
<p>
 In a recent multilateral convention on the environment, Evokia made a reservation to the effect that certain articles of the convention, dealing with disposal of nuclear waste, would not apply to Amnesia. Forgettia, which is also a party to the convention, objected and precluded the entry into force of the convention as between itself and Evokia. Forty states, some of which are part of a regional trading bloc with Forgettia, also objected to the reservation, but did not preclude its entry into force. The remaining twenty states made no objection.
<p>
<b>A) Worth 30 marks. Suggested time 55 minutes.</b>
<p>
 Evokia and Forgettia agree to submit the dispute over Amnesia to the International Court of Justice. The Court is asked to decide which of the two states has sovereignty over Amnesia. Write the decision of the Court.
<p><br>
Assume that the International Court of Justice holds that Evokia has sovereignty over the island of Amnesia. (This decision should have no impact on your answer to Question A). 
<p>
About 40 miles from Amnesia is the equally small island of Nivhah (&quot;N&quot;). Unlike Amnesia, Nivhah has an indigenous population, who call themselves Nivhi. In the last century, Nivhah was colonized by the state of Glancia (&quot;G&quot;). Glancia mined phosphates on Nivhah during the colonial period and continued to do so even after it had listed the island as a non-self-governing territory under the UN Charter. By 1990, when a referendum was held on Nivhah and the population voted overwhelmingly for independence, the island had been ravaged by phosphate mining. Even though the Nivhi now have their own state, many of them leave the island and their traditional way of life to seek employment elsewhere. 
<p>
Over the last few years, a particular species of sea creature, the aubergine-de-mer (&quot;adm&quot;), has become a delicacy in Europe and North America. The waters off the coast of Nivhah are rich in aubergine-de-mer. The best grounds for harvesting aubergine-de-mer are between Amnesia and Nivhah, closer to Nivhah. In 1993, Nivhah declares an EEZ that extends to the halfway point between the islands, 20 miles out from the shoreline of Nivhah. Since the aubergine-de-mer grounds are 10 to 20 miles off the coast of Nivhah, this has the effect of encompassing all the aubergine-de-mer grounds. Conrad Black's new fishing concern, Byliner (&quot;BL&quot;), is very interested in acquiring the exclusive right to fish for aubergine-de-mer in this area and makes a very attractive offer to the Nivhah government for the right. The Nivhah government determines that such a deal would generate enough revenue to sustain many aspects of the traditional Nivhi way of life. Just as they are about to close the deal, in the spring of 1994, Evokia declares an EEZ around Amnesia. Instead of respecting the Nivhi EEZ, Evokia declares an EEZ that extends to the outer limit of the 12 mile territorial sea of Nivhah, thereby encompassing most of the aubergine-de-mer grounds. 
<p>
<b>B) Worth 15 marks. Suggested time 25 minutes.</b>
<p>
Evokia and Nivhah submit to arbitration the delimitation of a single maritime boundary involving both shelf and fisheries jurisdiction in the waters between Amnesia and Nivhah. Write the decision of the arbitral panel. 
<p><br>
There is a considerable delay before the arbitral panel hears the matter of the maritime boundary delimitation between Evokia and Nivhah. The Nivhah government suspects that the Evokian government is stalling. Byliner is anxious to close its deal with the Nivhah government and begin fishing for aubergine-de-mer. Without waiting for the matter to come to arbitration, the Nivhah government goes ahead with the deal and grants Byliner the exclusive right to fish aubergine-de-mer within the waters Nivhah claims. Gambling that the arbitral panel will decide on an equidistant boundary, Byliner begins to fish. The Evokian government reacts strongly to these actions. The Evokian Coast Guard stops a Byliner trawler fishing 15 miles off the coast of Nivhah and confiscates the lucrative catch onboard without compensation. 
 <p>
Evokia sells the confiscated catch to Joblaws (&quot;J&quot;), a Canadian supermarket chain that sells its own Prime Minister's Choice brand of pickled aubergine-de-mer called &quot;Memories of  Oblivion.&quot; When the catch arrives in Canada, Byliner sues Joblaws in the Ontario Court of Justice, claiming that it has title to the catch. Canada has never recognized Nivhah as a state in deference to the powerful People's Republic of Cauchemar (&quot;C&quot;). Cauchemar maintains that prior to colonization by Glancia, Nivhah was part of Cauchemar and that Nivhah should therefore have been restored to Cauchemar on decolonization.
<p>
<b>C) Worth 35 marks. Suggested time 1 hour and 5 minutes.</b>
 <p>
 Write the decision of the Ontario court.
<p><br>
<h3>PART TWO (ONE QUESTION)</h3>

<b>Worth 20 marks. Suggested time 35 minutes.
<p>
Choose one of the following two questions. Either
<p>
A)</b> The debate between the majority and the dissent in the Supreme Court of Canada decision in <cite>Finta</cite> translates into two distinct visions of what the domestic prosecution of war crimes is all about. What are these visions and which one is preferable? 
<p>
<b>or
<p>
B)</b> The debate between the majority and the dissent in the US Supreme Court decision in <cite>Sabbatino</cite> involves a disagreement over the role of the domestic courts in international law. What are these roles and which one is preferable?

 The states of Evokia (&quot;E&quot;) and Forgettia (&quot;F&quot;) face each other across a 200 mile channel connecting the Seas of Memor and Oblivion. Both states claim sovereignty over two small islands, which they call Amnesia (&quot;A&quot;) and Baffould (&quot;B&quot;).

The record is now part of the archives of the Forgettian Museum of Natural History. In the same period, Forgettia built a lighthouse on Amnesia and another on a desolate point of Baffould. These lighthouses have not functioned for over half a century. Forgettia has continuously maintained buoys and other nautical markers off the coasts of both islands.
<p>
In a recent multilateral convention on the environment, Evokia made a reservation to the effect that certain articles of the convention, dealing with disposal of nuclear waste, would not apply to Amnesia and Baffould. Forgettia, which is also a party to the convention, objected and precluded the entry into force of the convention as between itself and Evokia. Forty states, some of  which are part of a regional trading bloc with Forgettia, also objected to the reservation, but did not preclude its entry into force. The remaining twenty states made no objection.
 <p>
 <b>A) Worth 25 marks.</b>
<p>
Evokia and Forgettia agree to submit the dispute over Amnesia to the International Court of Justice. The Court is asked to decide which of the two states has sovereignty over Amnesia. Write the decision of the Court.
<p><br>
In the mid-nineteenth century, the state of Glancia (&quot;G&quot;) briefly used Baffould as a penal colony, but abandoned the practice and has never made a territorial claim to Baffould. The prisoners, left to fend for themselves, became integrated into the indigenous society, and many current inhabitants of Baffould are of mixed race. The indigenous name for Baffould is Nivhah (&quot;N&quot;), and the indigenous population call themselves Nivhi. At the time, Nivhi political, social and economic organization was highly developed, and Nivhi have long traded with foreign traders and trading companies. There have never been, however, any dealings between the Nivhi and either Evokia or Forgettia. The Nivhi consider themselves a sovereign people and their island a sovereign state. A number of neighbouring states, foreign fishing fleets and recently a multinational corporation doing exploratory offshore drilling in the vicinity deal with the Nivhah government on this basis. However, Evokia and Forgettia have successfully pressured states not to recognize Nivhah as a state.
<p>
<b>B) Worth 15 marks.</b>
<p>
Evokia and Forgettia also ask the International Court of Justice to decide which of the two states has sovereignty over Baffould (Nivhah). The rules of the Court prevent the Nivhah government from intervening, but Glancia, which takes the Nivhah position, has been granted permission to intervene in the case.
<p>
What arguments can Glancia make to establish that the Nivhi have sovereignty over Baffould (Nivhah)?
<p><br>
Assume that the International Court of Justice holds that Evokia has sovereignty over the island of Amnesia and dismisses the case concerning sovereignty over Baffould (Nivhah) on jurisdictional grounds. (Neither decision should have any impact on your answers to Questions A and B). Evokia and Forgettia have since recognized the state of Nivhah (henceforth known as Nivhah). 
<p>
Like Amnesia, Nivhah has few natural resources. Many Nivhi leave the island and their traditional way of life to seek employment elsewhere. Over the last few years, a particular species of sea creature, the aubergine-de-mer (&quot;adm&quot;), has become a delicacy in Europe and North America. The waters off the coast of Nivhah are rich in aubergine-de-mer. The best grounds for harvesting aubergine-de-mer are between Amnesia and Nivhah, closer to Nivhah. In 1993, Nivhah declares an EEZ that extends to the halfway point between the islands, 20 miles out from the shoreline of Nivhah. Since the aubergine-de-mer grounds are 10 to 20 miles off the coast of Nivhah, this has the effect of encompassing all the aubergine-de-mer grounds. Conrad Black's new fishing concern, Byliner (&quot;BL&quot;), is very interested in acquiring the exclusive right to fish for aubergine-de-mer in this area and makes a very attractive offer to the Nivhah government for the right. The Nivhah government determines that such a deal would generate enough revenue to sustain many aspects of the traditional Nivhi way of life. Just as they are about to close the deal, in the spring of 1994, Evokia declares an EEZ around Amnesia. Instead of respecting the Nivhi EEZ, Evokia declares an EEZ that extends to the outer limit of the 12 mile territorial sea of Nivhah, thereby encompassing most of the aubergine-de-mer grounds. 
<p>
<b>C) Worth 10 marks.</b>
<p>
Evokia and Nivhah submit to arbitration the delimitation of a single maritime boundary involving both shelf and fisheries jurisdiction in the waters between Amnesia and Nivhah. Write the decision of the arbitral panel. 
<p><br>
There is a considerable delays before the arbitral panel hears the matter of the maritime boundary delimitation between Evokia and Nivhah. The Nivhah government suspects that the Evokian government is stalling. Byliner is anxious to close its deal with the Nivhah government and begin fishing for aubergine-de-mer. Without waiting for the matter to come to arbitration, the Nivhi government goes ahead with the deal and grants Byliner the exclusive right to fish aubergine-de-mer within the waters Nivhah claims. Gambling that the arbitral panel will decide on an equidistant boundary, Byliner begins to fish. The Evokian government reacts strongly to these actions. The Evokian Coast Guard stops a Byliner trawler fishing 15 miles off the coast of Nivhah and confiscates the lucrative catch inboard without compensation.
<p>
Evokia sells the confiscated catch to Joblaws (&quot;J&quot;), a Canadian supermarket chain that sells its own Prime Minister's Choice brand of pickled aubergine-de-mer called &quot;Memories of  Oblivion.&quot; When the catch arrives in Canada, Byliner sues Joblaws in the Ontario Court of Justice, claiming that it has title to the catch. Canada does not recognize Nivhah as a state.
<p>
<b>D) Worth 30 marks.</b>
<p>
Write the decision of the Ontario court. 
<p><br>
<h3>PART TWO (ONE QUESTION)</h3>
<blockquote>
International Society had to find its own theory. It chose to see itself as a collection of state-societies turned inside out, like a glove. It chose to be an unsocial society creating itself separately from the development of its subordinate societies, ignoring the idea and the ideal of democracy, depriving itself of the possibility of using social power, especially legal relations, to bring about the survival and prospering of the whole human race.
<blockquote>
Philip Allott, <cite>Eunomia: New Order for a New World</cite>

<h3>Question 1</h3>

 A few years ago, Charles Fairview, a well known Toronto real estate developer, bought some land on Bloor Street. He intended to tear down the stores on the land and erect an office building which he would retain as an investment property. He paid for the realty by transferring to the vendor an undeveloped lot in the suburbs worth $100,000, by assuming an existing mortgage of $300,000 and by giving the vendor $80,000 in cash which he had borrowed from his bank. Fairview's legal fees in relation to transactions amounted to $20,000. Fairview rented the stores to some merchants for a few months before he demolished the buildings.
<p>
 Fairview was busy with other projects and the site remained unused for several years. Fairview decided that he would not be able to build the project in the foreseeable future, so he sold the site to Ann Abel for $1,500,000. Fairview received $300,000 when the transaction closed, and took back a mortgage for the remainder of the price which ran for 10 years with yearly principal payments of $120,000. Interest on the outstanding balance was to be paid at the rate of 3% per year.
<p>
About five years later, when Abel had $700,000 left to pay on the mortgage, Fairview sold his interest in the mortgage to a broker for $400,000.
<p>
What are the income tax consequences of these events?
<p><br>
<h3>Question 2</h3>

The Federal Government is undertaking a review of the Income Tax Act. The Minister of Finance has heard complaints from various people and groups that the tax treatment of employees is unfair. The Minister is willing to reform the Income Tax Act if he is convinced that changes are necessary. He has asked you to prepare a memorandum relating to the taxation of employees and related issues. He is interested in understanding the present position and any reasoned suggestions which you may make.
<p>Write the memorandum. 
<p><br>
<h3>Question 3</h3>
Valerie operates a mail order book business. Five years ago she purchased the client list of a competitor for $80,000. The vendor agreed not to compete with Valerie in the business. A year later, Valerie decided to focus her business on those clients who lived in Southern Ontario, so she sold that part of the list which contained the names of clients outside Southern Ontario to Tony for $20,000. Valerie's business is going very well so she decided to sell her present office furniture and equipment and buy new equipment to refurnish her office. The new equipment cost $30,000.
<p>
In order to run her business more efficiently, Valerie contracts with LesIey for Lesley to actually distribute the books. In order to do this, Lesley has to spend $8,000 to reconfigure her distribution process. The expenditure is largely to buy the equipment which is dedicated solely to the distribution of Valerie's books. Valerie agrees to pay $5,000 of the $8,000 expenditure plus a set fee for each book distributed by Lesley. 
<p>
Unfortunately, the recession takes its toll on Valerie's business. Earlier this year she was forced to simply leave the business. All she was able to salvage was the furniture which she used in her office. She now uses the furniture in her home. The rest she left to her landlord as payment for the rent she owed him. At the time she got out of the business, she owed her law firm $7,500. The law firm was expanding and moving to new premises. In return for forgiving her debt, the law firm asked Valerie to be its decorating consultant in relation to the new offices. Valerie agreed. The law firm was also happy because it would have cost them over $10,000 to retain a consultant for these purposes.

<h3>Question 1 (50 marks, approximately one hour)</h3>

One Friday night, Sam Jackson and his friend Bill Mosun were watching television at Sam's house. Sam's parents were out for the evening and the boys had nothing to do. They were bored with the show they were watching and began to discuss what they could do to liven up their evening. Sam had just received his driver's license and was not allowed to take out the family car unless one of his parents was with him. However, his father had been in a hurry
 when he left the house, and he had thrown the keys on the counter just as he was going out the door. Bill noticed this and suggested that they take the car out for a quick spin. Sam was very reluctant. He had already taken the car once without his parents' permission and when his parents caught him, he was prohibited from going out with his friends for a month. However, Bill was enthusiastic about going for a ride and he assured Sam that his parents would never find out. Bill said they could just go to the drive-in and see who was there, grab some food and then
 be back in half an hour. Sam agreed that this sounded like fun so he decided they could take just a quick spin in his parents' car.
<p>
 Sam's family car was a beautiful red 1965 Mustang. Once Sam got behind the wheel, he found it impossible to resist the urge to just see what the car could do. As he drove away from his house, he pressed down on the accelerator. The car lunged forward. Some girls that lived down the street saw Sam and Bill and began to wave and yell at them. They stopped and two of the girls, Sarah and Emily, got into the car. Bill turned up the stereo and before the boys knew it they were cruising out towards the Flats where the hot rods raced. They were having
 a great time.
<p>
They decided that they would run just one race. Sarah got out of the car, but Emily wanted to stay in. Sam revved up the engine and tore down the strip. They were well ahead of the nearest car, when Sam suddenly noticed a dog about to run across the road. He slammed on his brakes. Their car skidded sideways and flipped into the ditch. Fortunately, no one was killed. However, both Bill and Emily were seriously injured. In addition, Mr. Partridge, who had been walking his dog along the highway, was injured when he was thrown into the ditch by the force of the car passing so close to where he was walking. Mr. Partridge did not hear the car because he was almost completely deaf.
<p>
The forensic evidence indicated that when the accident occurred, Sam was driving 20 kilometres above the speed limit and was accelerating rapidly. None of the occupants of the car were wearing seat-belts. There was no indication that any alcohol or any other illegal substances had been consumed.
<p>
Someone in a nearby house called an ambulance. However, because of budgetary cutbacks, there were fewer ambulances available than usual. Therefore the ambulance took over forty-five minutes to get to the scene of the accident--three times as long as the time period indicated in the provincial guidelines. The ambulance took Bill, Sam, Emily, and Mr. Partridge to the hospital.
<p>
When they arrived in the hospital, Dr. Watkins took charge of them. He properly diagnosed and treated the injures of Sam and Mr. Partridge. Unfortunately, while he did diagnose the severe break in Bill's right leg, he did not set the leg properly. Bill's leg never properly healed and he suffered a permanent impairment of his leg. However, it turned out that Bill had a rare bone condition, osteo-nonhealitis. This condition interfered with the normal healing process, with the result when a victim of the disease like Bill suffered a broken bone, there was only a 35% chance that the break would heal even with the best treatment.
<p>
Dr. Watkins also treated Emily who had sustained a head injury. Dr. Watkins diagnosed and treated her properly. Despite this, Emily did not make the recovery that might have been expected. In fact, she suffered some permanent impairment of her vision. However, it is impossible to determine whether this impairment occurred because of the nature of the original accident, because of the delay in treatment or because of some unknown natural causes. The medical experts indicated that they could not get an accurate record of the nature and sources of Emily's difficulty because of the delay in getting her to the hospital.
<p>
<b>As a result of this accident, Bill, Emily and Mr. Partridge are all considering suing in negligence. Your law firm has been retained by Bill, Emily and Mr. Partridge to make a preliminary assessment of the merits of their prospective actions. Please prepare a memorandum of law on this question. Your memo should be organized to first address Bill's ability to recover in negligence for his injuries, then Emily's ability to recover for her injuries and finally, Mr. Partridge's ability to recover for his injuries. If any of these plaintiffs could claim against more than one defendant, you should discuss the merits of their actions against each potential defendant. You should also make sure to discuss any defences that could be raised against any of these plaintiffs. Please explicitly indicate if you believe that you need to know more facts or if you are relying on any factual assumptions that are not contained in the above summary of the facts.</b>
<p><br>
<h3>Question Two (20 Marks, approximately 30 minutes)</h3>

The defendant is a firm of accountants called Tried &amp; True (&quot;Tried&quot;). Tried serves as the auditors and general accountants for Cosmo Cosmetics, plc. In 1987, Tried prepared the annual statutory audit for Cosmo, as it had done for many years. In 1986, the chief financial officer for Cosmo had discussions with Tried about raising capital for a planned expansion. Tried fully supported and indeed encouraged this idea. In fact, Tried released the annual audits of Cosmo's financial statements earlier than usual in order to facilitate Cosmo's efforts to secure investors. But while the financial statements were released early, they were in every respect just the ordinary annual financial statements required by statute.
<p>
Cosmo showed the 1987 financial statement prepared by Tried to several potential investors. Betty Boop had no familiarity with Cosmo but she was very impressed with the financial statements. She decided to invest $50,000 in Cosmo on the strength of the financial statements. However, Cosmo soon ran into financial difficulties. It turned out that Tried had mistakenly treated a $300,000 liability as an asset. The result was that while financial statements showed that the business was prospering, in fact it was operating at a loss. Unfortunately, Cosmo soon went out of business and Ms. Boop lost the entire $50,000 she had invested.
<p>
Ms. Boop brought an action in negligence against Tried. At trial it was found that Tried was negligent in preparing the financial statement and that they owed Ms. Boop a duty of care.  The Court of Appeal has affirmed. Tried has now appealed to the House of Lords. The only issue before the House of Lord is whether or not Tried owed Ms. Boop a duty of care. It has been agreed by the parties that if they do owe her a duty of care, they will be liable to compensate her for the loss she suffered when she invested in Cosmo.
<p>
However, it is now 1990, and the House of Lords has just handed down their decision in <cite>Caparo v. Dickman</cite> (in Volume IV of your torts materials at p. VIII-53 ff).
<p>
<b>Assume that you are a member of the House of Lords (if you wish, you may specify which Law Lord you are). Please write your judgment in Boop v. Tried on the issue of whether or not Tried owed Ms. Boop a duty of care. You may, of course, make reference to any material that you believe is relevant (including decisions from other jurisdictions) but you should pay particular attention to the very recent House of Lords decision in <cite>Caparo</cite>.</b>
<p>
<h3>Question Three (30 Marks, approximately 45 minutes)</h3>

In a recent article entitled &quot;The Uneasy Place of Principle in Tort Law&quot;, George C. Christie describes what he takes to be a central dilemma of the negligence inquiry:
<blockquote>
One could continue to maintain that tort law should be directed by clear statements of principle but that the principle of reasonable foreseeability is not the correct one. Or one could insist that the principle of reasonable foreseeability is the correct one but that the courts have made a hash of it. I do not think that either of these alternatives will work. To my mind the principle of 'reasonable foreseeability' is a good one; it just cannot do all the work demanded of it. Moreover, I am extremely doubtful that any better general principle of tort liability could be formulated.
</blockquote>
Discuss this passage. Is Christie's point persuasive? Discuss why it is or why it is not making reference to cases and other materials that we have covered in the course where they are relevant to your analysis.

<b>1.</b> Darth and Delendum are companies that have for decades been drilling for oil on lands that are north and south of each other. This oil drilling is the mainstay of the local economy.
<p>
Oil drilling produces vast quantities of brine. There is no market for this brine, and the prevailing practice among oil drilling companies is to place it in large steel tanks so that it will not pollute the neighbouring groundwater. Darth and Delendum used earthen pits instead of steel tanks. Their reason for using earthen pits, which are much cheaper than steel tanks, is that all the land that is adjacent to theirs sits on a huge zone of limestone. Scientists had advised
 them in accordance with the best scientific evidence that limestone is not porous, and so, because there was no chance that the brine would pollute their neighbours' groundwater, the more expensive steel tanks were unnecessary.
<p>
 Recently the Partridge family purchased what used to be grazing land to the west of Darth and Delendum. The Partridges built a house on the land and sunk a well to have drinking water. They soon noticed that their drinking water was quite salty. It turned out that contrary to the expectation of the scientists the salt from the brine pits had somehow worked its way through the limestone barrier and had contaminated the Partridge's groundwater. The evidence, however, also indicates that the groundwater was full of natural contaminants and would perhaps not have been drinkable in any case.
<p>
 The jurisdiction has a statute that reads: &quot;No person shall allow waste to pollute the waters of this province without first giving it the treatment necessary to safeguard the legitimate beneficial uses of such waters.&quot; The statute imposes a fine for violations.
<p>
Discuss the legal issues raised by a tort action by the Partridges against Darth and Delendum. Discuss also the contribution issues that arise between Darth and Delendum if both are held liable. (A copy of the statutory provisions governing contribution is appended to this examination). In answering this question, assess the soundness of the applicable law where appropriate, and if you think a court might come to an unjust conclusion suggest reasoned criticisms and reasoned alternatives.
<p><br>
<b>2.</b> Patricia and her partner had decided that they did not want (and could not afford) to have any more children and that they also wanted to avoid the inconvenience of using contraceptives. One day Patricia picked up a pamphlet that was available in the display section of her pharmacy. The pamphlet, entitled Voluntary Sterilization -- The Surest Way to Avoid Unwanted Pregnancy" was published and circulated by the Children-by-Choice Association. The pamphlet was organized in a question and answer format and stated at one point: 
<blockquote>
&quot;Q. Should contraceptives be used after tubal ligation?&quot;
<p>
A. No. There is no possibility of pregnancy and contraceptives are not necessary.&quot;
</blockquote>
Accordingly, on her next visit to her gynaecologist, Dr. Dense, she arranged to undergo a tubal ligation. Nevertheless, several months after Dr. Dense performed the operation Patricia became pregnant and gave birth to a healthy child.
<p>
In fact, the statement made in the pamphlet was incorrect. There is a known but small failure rate even in properly performed operations due to the spontaneous regeneration of the fallopian tubes. Moreover, in outlining the procedure to Patricia Dr. Dense had failed to mention the possibility that the operation might not terminate her ability to have a child.
<p>
Patricia now wishes to sue both Children-by-Choice and Dr. Dense. She claims that she would not have undergone the procedure had she been told that pregnancy remained remotely possible.

Write the first draft of the comment. (Do not repeat the facts.)
<blockquote>
BOLD SPIRIT J.: The facts in this case are elemental. After a tragic quarrel between Mr. Lear and his daughter Cordelia (the plaintiff in the present case), Mr. F Lear executed a will cutting Cordelia out of his estate and leaving his entire fortune to his other two daughters, Goneril and Regan. Lear and Cordelia were subsequently reconciled, and Lear then instructed his solicitor, Mr. Kent (the defendant), to prepare a new will dividing his estate equally among his three daughters. Kent neglected to act on these instructions, and before the new will was prepared and executed, Lear died. After Lear's death, his estate went to Goneril and Regan in accordance with the existing will, and they refused -- as was their legal right -- to give Cordelia the share that their father intended her to have. Cordelia now sues Kent, claiming that the negligent delay has deprived her of the benefits to which she would have been entitled under the new will. It is acknowledged on all sides that if Kent owed Cordelia a duty, he negligently breached it. The question if is: did he owe her a duty?
<p>
 On hearing this case, my first inclination was to answer in the negative. Although here the plaintiff is fortunate in having been able to establish that the final intentions of the testator in the present case were firm, clear and attainable, such damage is generally too speculative and uncertain to be recoverable. The intention to benefit the plaintiff usually exists only in the mind of the testator, so that the solicitor's negligence harms only the plaintiff's hope and expectation, and not any existing financial or other interest.
<p>
Moreover, the duty that Kent was under appears to be a contractual one only, and owed to the person who retained and instructed him, Lear, rather than to the intended beneficiary. To allow the plaintiff to recover in tort might seem a circumvention of the rule against third party beneficiaries in contract.
<p>
Finally, if the law gave effect to Lear's wishes, it would effectively increase the size of his estate by the sum awarded to Cordelia at Kent's expense. No one can tell precisely how Lear would have wished to dispose of an estate thus augmented. What is plain is that the family as a whole would be better off because of Kent's negligence.
<p>
These considerations initially led me to wonder whether a decision in favour of the plaintiff would represent a departure from accepted principles of compensation. I have, however, concluded that they should not stand in the way of the simple justice of Cordelia's claim.
<p>
 Before addressing the legal questions at the heart of the present case, it is desirable to identify the reasons of justice that prompt me to conclude that a duty should be owed by the testator's solicitor to a disappointed beneficiary. The
 principal reasons are as follows.
<p>
 (1) In the forefront stands the extraordinary fact that, if such a duty is not recognised, the only persons who might have a valid claim (i.e., the testator and his estate) have suffered no loss, and the only person who has suffered a loss (i.e., the disappointed beneficiary) has no claim. It can therefore be said that, if the solicitor owes no duty to the intended beneficiaries, there is a lacuna in the law that needs to be filled. This I regard as being a point of cardinal importance in the present case.
<p>(2) The injustice of denying such a remedy is reinforced if one considers the importance of legacies in a society which recognises the right of citizens to leave their assets to whom they please, and in which, as a result, legacies can be of great importance to individual citizens, providing very often the only opportunity for a citizen to acquire a significant capital sum. It is where a testator instructs a small firm of solicitors that mistakes of this kind are most likely to occur, with the result that it tends to be people of modest means, who need the money so badly, who suffer.
<p>
(3) Solicitors cannot complain if such a liability may be imposed. If one of them has been negligent in such a way as to defeat his client's testamentary intentions, he must regard himself as very lucky indeed if the effect of the law is that he is not liable to pay damages in the ordinary way. It can involve no injustice to render him subject to such a liability.
<p>
I turn now to the law, which we must consider against the background of recent developments. Within a few decades our law has changed from a blanket denial of recovery for economic loss to a more liberal regime. I need only mention the well-known cases of CNR v Norsk and Winnipeg Condominium v. Bird.
<p>
In this case, the defendant is under a duty of care to the plaintiff arising from an extension of the principle of  assumption of responsibility explored in Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd. In my view, although the present case is not directly covered by the decided cases, the law in this area has not ossified. 
<p>
It is legitimate to extend the law to the limited extent proposed using the incremental approach by way of analogy advocated in Caparo Industries v. Dickman. 
<p>
A duty of care arises if there is a special relationship between the parties. The categories of cases in which such a special relationship can be held to exist are not closed. The special relationship is created by the defendant voluntarily assuming to act in the matter by involving himself in the plaintiff's affairs or by choosing to speak. If he does so assume to act or speak he is said to have assumed responsibility for carrying through the matter he has entered upon. 
<p>
The solicitor who accepts instructions to draw a will knows that the future economic welfare of the intended beneficiary is dependent upon his careful execution of the task. It is true that the intended beneficiary (being ignorant of the instructions) may not rely on the particular solicitor's actions. But the solicitor by accepting the instructions has entered upon, and therefore assumed responsibility for, the task of procuring the execution of a skillfully drawn will knowing that the beneficiary is wholly dependent upon his carefully carrying out his function. That assumption of responsibility for the task is a feature of all the categories of special relationship so far identified in the authorities.
<p>
Moreover, it is fair, just and reasonable to impose liability on the solicitor. Or The proper transmission of property from one generation to the next is dependent upon the due discharge by solicitors of their duties. Although in any particular case it may not be possible to demonstrate that the intended beneficiary relied upon the solicitor, society as a whole does rely on solicitors to carry out their will-making functions carefully.
<p>
Further, even apart from the decided cases the law should recognize the unique features of the present litigation and should fashion an effective remedy to repair the injustice to the disappointed beneficiary. In the case of a negligently drawn will, the will has no effect at all until the death. It will have been filed away, not to surface again until the testator either wishes to vary it or dies. In the majority of cases the negligence will lie hidden until it takes effect on the death of the testator, i.e., at the very point in time when normally the error will become incapable of remedy.
<p>
It seems to me that it is open to this court to fashion a remedy to fill a lacuna in the law and so prevent the injustice which would otherwise occur on the facts of cases such as the present. It is mere practical justice to make available a tort remedy to the intended beneficiary who (as the solicitor can reasonably foresee) may, as a result of the solicitor's negligence, be deprived of his intended legacy in circumstances in which neither the testator nor his estate will have a remedy against the solicitor. Such a remedy would merely provide an incentive through tort law for the solicitor to do what he is in any case contractually obligated to do. Moreover, the fact that all solicitors have malpractice insurance means that the costs of the solicitor's negligence, instead of being concentrated on the disappointed beneficiary, will be spread through the all users of legal services.
<p>
A famous judge once remarked that, at bottom, the existence of a duty is an issue of policy for the judge to decide. There is no more worthy policy than the pursuit of justice. To my mind it would be unacceptable if, because of some technical rules of law, the wishes and expectations of testators and beneficiaries generally could be defeated by the negligent actions of solicitors without there being any redress. If justice requires that a duty exist, courts should declare what justice requires. 
<p>
In the result, the problems that initially troubled me can be seen to fade innocuously away. Cases such as this call for an appropriate remedy, and the common law is not so sterile as to be incapable of supplying that remedy when it is needed.
<p>
For these reasons I hold that the defendant breached a duty owed to the plaintiff.

<h3>QUESTION ONE (65 marks)</h3>

Of The Windrush River meanders south through Flavelle County and eventually flows into the saltwater of Heron Sound. It is a beautiful area and has long been a place for tourists to visit for a bit of holiday fun and seafood. Many years ago there was a regular passenger ferry, the Sea Star, which operated across the mouth of the river, connecting the holiday towns of West Heron and East Heron. However, the ferry service fell into disuse in the 1960s, and the Sea Star was simply moored alongside the West Heron pier, operating there as a souvenir shop.
<p>
Last summer Zak, a Toronto entrepreneur, decided to revive the old ferry service. Not having the cash for an outright purchase of the ferry, he decided to lease the Sea Star from Madge, its longtime owner. Madge also agreed to sell the piers in both West Heron and East Heron to Zak so long as her cousin Sue was given an exclusive long term lease to open oyster bars (or restaurants) for the local tourists on both the West Heron and East Heron piers. This was a way, thought Madge, of keeping some of the benefits of the re-opened ferry service in the family. Zak was also delighted to agree, thinking that this would help to integrate a ferry ride and an oyster dinner into a very attractive &quot;evening out&quot; for the tourists. He also offered to pay all of the maintenance and repair costs for the Sea Star for the summer.
<p>
Now the idea that Zak was going to revive the old Sea Star for his new ferry service was a source of some amusement for the local inhabitants of West and East Heron. No one figured that the ferry's old wooden hull, now somewhat rotted, would make it past midsummer. They tried to tell Zak this, of course, but Zak seemed to think that he would be fine. Zak was more concerned about possible underwater hazards in the river crossing between West and East Heron and asked Cal, a local official for the Heron Sound Sea Rescue and Safety Service, about this. Cal, who knew Heron Sound quite well but almost nothing about the Windrush River, replied, &quot;Oh, there should be no problem for you. Just keep to the port side of the channel. There are some rocks on the other side.&quot; Now Zak, who fancied himself to be a bit of a sailor, thought Cal meant the port (or left) side of the channel going from West to East Heron. After all, they were standing on the West Heron pier at the time of the conversation. But Cal, being even more the sailor than Zak, actually meant the port (or left) side going from East to West Heron since that is the way the current runs within the channel and it has long been the custom for seasoned sailors in Flavelle County (and elsewhere) to define the channel (and all directions through it) as running in the direction of the current.
<p>
The first day of Zak's new venture was June 21, l995, the first day of summer, and Zak decided to launch things with a big party for his friends from Toronto. Everybody had a little too much to drink at Sue's West Heron pier &quot;Sea Star Oyster Bar&quot; before getting onto the Sea Star for the inaugural trip over to East Heron. There was even more to drink on the ferry, and since Zak's Toronto friends had brought some uninvited friends of their own, the Sea Star was very much overloaded. While the Sea Star had a sufficient number of lifejackets for a ferry of
 its size according to s. 10 of Flavelle County's <cite>Water Safety Act</cite>, on this particular trip, due to the very unusual circumstances, there were twice the number of passengers as available lifejackets. 
<p>
The trip went well until the Sea Star was halfway across the river from West to East Heron. At that point, one of the drunken passengers (no one now knows who) on the port side shouted "Whale!" Although there had never been a whale sighting in the Windrush River, almost everyone rushed over to the port side of the Sea Star to have a look. This caused the ferry to lurch abruptly to port and to veer towards those very rocks that Cal had tried so unsuccessfully to warn Zak about. There was, almost immediately, a crunching sound as the Sea Star appeared to go aground on the rocks. The Sea Star quickly took on water and began to sink. The passengers grabbed lifejackets where they could and jumped into the water. 
<p>
We now have a complete account of this tragic affair. Of the 60 people on board, 30 managed to get hold of the 30 lifejackets that were available before going overboard, but half of these were drowned anyway. All of the other 30 passengers who did not get lifejackets have drowned. The Sea Star has sunk to the bottom of the river. However, it is now unclear whether the ferry first took on water because of her initial contact with the submerged rocks, or whether the ferry's lurch to port when the passengers rushed to that side to see the whale caused some cargo to shift in the Sea Star's hold and to go crashing through its thin wooden, and slightly rotted, hull. This also could have been enough for it to sink and to eventually come to rest and be damaged on the rocks. 
<p>
As it happens, the Sea Star was carrying some very special and unexpected cargo in its hold. Back in Toronto, Zak had long been storing about forty barrels of toxic waste on an old site near Falconer Hall. He had seen the inaugural voyage of the Sea Star as a first-rate opportunity to dump the waste offshore in Heron Sound. His plan had been to drop the ferry passengers off at East Heron for some further revelry and to steam out into the Sound to make the dump, returning for the passengers later. All this, of course, was strictly illegal according to Flavelle County's <cite>Toxic Waste Dumping Act</cite>. Only the sinking of the Sea Star had foiled the plan. 
<p>
But this was the cargo which had shifted in the hold of the ferry and now, at the bottom of the river, these barrels of toxic waste have begun to leak into the river. As a consequence, certain oyster beds owned by Sam near the mouth of the river, where it empties into the salt water of Heron Sound, have become contaminated. Sam normally sells all his oysters to Sue's two oyster bars but now cannot. Sue has secured, at greater expense, an alternative supply of oysters, but, unfortunately, a local newspaper, <cite>Shell Shock</cite>, has published a detailed story with the headline &quot;Heron Sound Oysters Contaminated with Toxic Waste&quot;. The headlined story, without all the details, has been picked up by the national press and now no tourist wants to buy any oysters in West or East Heron. Indeed, since the ferry accident, Sue hasn't had much trade of any kind, oysters or otherwise. After all, the ferry connection was to be very important for her business on the two piers and without a ferry, and without oysters, few tourists are keen to visit the Heron Sound area much at all.
<p>
Zak has approached you for legal advice. While he recognizes that he may have done to some things that were wrong, and may be sued by any or all of Sue, Sam, Madge, and the estate of Fred (one of the 30 passengers who died without a lifejacket), he is also of the view that others might be responsible. Indeed, he thinks that he should have a legal remedy himself for his lost profits on the summer ferry service. Advise him.
<p><br>
<h3>QUESTION TWO (35 marks)</h3>
<blockquote>
&quot;There is, of course, something which is initially quite attractive about tort liability. It seems right that a person wrongfully injured by another should be able to hold that other party personally accountable in a private law action for damages. Moreover, it seems appropriate that the correction of what is a personal wrong between them should not be much affected by social interests and public policy.
<p>
But the abstract promise of this view quickly unravels when it is executed in the cases. Soon we begin to observe that what is right, or (to use the legal jargon) &quot;reasonable&quot;, between the parties is pretty much conditioned by a set of social understandings which are, in the final analysis, nothing more nor less than matters of public policy and social calculation. For example, nuisance defendants simply are permitted to harm plaintiffs if &quot;the local standard&quot; says so. Economic loss either is or is not recoverable according to how society happens to understand &quot;the ambit of the risk&quot;. And the standard of &quot;reasonable prudence&quot; can be as subjective (and forgiving) or objective (and strict) as we want in the circumstances. To pretend otherwise, and to pretend in particular that there is really anything here other than the very same practical politics that informs social legislation, is mere self-delusion. What <b>is</b> problematic is that this legislation is effected by an unelected, unaccountable, and unrepresentative judiciary.&quot; 
</blockquote>
Comment on the overall merits of this claim using examples and materials taken from the course.

<h3>Question One (30 Marks)</h3>

Thomas Lee had three children. His wife had died when the children were very young. Thomas's sister Lucy moved in with Thomas after his wife died to help him take care of the children. Lucy had continued to live with Thomas and the children. In July of 1994, Thomas told his sister Lucy that he wanted to speak with her about some important matters. Lucy was so overcome with emotion during this conversation that she could barely speak. She could only sob and nod as Thomas spoke.
<p>
First of all, Thomas told Lucy that he was giving her the jewellery that had been in his wife's family for generations. He said that the jewellery was very valuable and therefore it should be kept secure and not worn or used by anyone until both of his daughters were 25. Then he said that he wanted her to divide the jewellery equally between the two girls so that they would have some momentos of their mother. However, Thomas never delivered the jewellery to Lucy and it remained in his safety deposit box.
<p>
In addition, Thomas also told Lucy that he was going to leave her the family house. He stated that he wanted her to be able to live in and enjoy the house. He said that when she died the house was to go to the three children.
<p>
Thirdly, Thomas told Lucy that he was giving her the shares in the Sunnyhill Cooperative. He said that he had made a note of what he wanted her to do with these shares. His note said:
<blockquote>
I give my shares in the Sunnyhill Cooperative absolutely to my sister Lucy. Lucy is free to do anything she chooses with the shares. However, when the youngest child turns 21, Lucy is to divide any of the remaining shares evenly between herself and the three children.
</blockquote>
The by-laws of Sunnyhill Cooperative required that in order to effect a valid transfer the shares had to be endorsed and delivered to the new owner and the Board of Directors of the Cooperative had to approve the transfer. Thomas endorsed the shares certificates to Lucy and delivered them to her. He also applied to the cooperative to have the
 shares transferred into Lucy's name. However, it took some time for the board to approve the transfer. In the interim, Thomas continued to receive the dividends from the shares. He used these dividends to purchase further cooperative shares which he put into Lucy's name. Unfortunately, Thomas died before the Board of Directors approved the transfer of the shares.
<p>
When Thomas died, Lucy went to see the family solicitor. She told him about her interview with Thomas and about what he had said about the jewellery, the shares, and the family home. Thomas had executed a valid will. It was dated September 12,1994. Lucy became the administratrix of Thomas's estate. The will made no mention of the
 jewellery or of the Sunnyhill shares. However, there was a clause of the will in which Thomas stated that he left the family home to his sister Lucy, &quot;fully trusting that she will carry out my instructions.&quot; Under other terms of the will, Thomas provided for his sister Lucy and for his three children. Thomas left the residue of his estate to his wife's sister Alba.
<p>
<b>Lucy has consulted you to determine whether she has legal title to the jewellery, the Sunnyhill shares, or the family home. She also wants to know whether she has any obligations with respect to any of this property. Please advise Lucy on these matters.</b>
<p><br>
<h3>Question Two (15 Marks)</h3>

In his majority decision in McPhail v. Doulton, Lord Wilberforce states (at p.4-20 of your materials):
<blockquote>
As a matter of reason, to hold that a principle of equal division applies to a trust such as the present is certainly paradoxical. Equal division is surely the last thing the settlor ever intended: equal division among all may, probably would, produce a result beneficial to none. Why suppose the court would lend itself to a whimsical execution? And as regards authority, I do not find that the nature of the trust, and of the court's powers over trusts, ever called for any such rigid rule. Equal division may be sensible and has been decreed, in cases of family trusts, for a limited class; here there is life in the maxim &quot;equality is equity,&quot; but the cases provide numerous examples where this has not been so, and a different type of execution has been ordered, appropriate to the circumstances&quot;
</blockquote>
<b>Comment on the significance of the above passage, addressing why Lord Wilberforce is discussing the maxim &quot;equality is equity&quot;, what he determines about  that maxim, and what the signficance of this aspect of his holding is for the test for certainty of objects.</b>
<p><br>
<h3>Question 3 (40 Marks)</h3>

Teresa, the testatrix, had been an active Roman Catholic all of her life. She was also a member of a movement for reform in the area of women's rights within the church. Her will contained a number of legacies. Under the terms of her will, the residue of her estate went in equal proportions to her nieces, Estelle and Eunice.
<p>
Her first legacy provided for the establishment of a Roman Catholic school for girls. Although the stipulated area already contained a number of Catholic schools, including schools for Catholic girls, Teresa strongly believed that there was still an unfulfilled need for a Catholic girls' school. The terms of her will set out very carefully the purpose of the school which was to provide Roman Catholic girls with a feminist education. To that end, she specified that the work of women be studied in all of the core courses, including literature, history, science and religion. She further specified that the health courses should include information about gay and lesbian issues and about birth control, AIDS, and abortion.
<p>
In addition, Teresa stated that at least 70% of the faculty of the school be female. She provided for the school to be run by a managing foundation which was composed of at least 70% women and she also ensured that a substantial proportion of the managing foundation be pro-choice on abortion and on sexual orientation. This foundation was to be run under the larger auspices of the diocese in which Teresa lived. 
<p>
The Bishop of the diocese brought an application to the court to have the money applied to the already existing Catholic schools on the ground that the population of the area would never support such a school. He noted that the population of the diocese was only 3,500, most of whom were devout Irish Catholics. 
<p>
The second legacy in Teresa's will provided for $75,000 of her estate to be left in trust to the &quot;Catholic Beneficial Society&quot; in her diocese for its work in relieving the suffering of the members of the diocese who lived in poverty, for the education of the children of the needy members of the diocese, and to provide for counselling and consciousness-raising activities for Catholic women who were having family or personal difficulties or who wanted to leave abusive situations. The terms stated that the legacy was to be divided equally among these three purposes. The President and Board of the Society were given absolute discretion concerning how to apply the funds to each of these purposes. There is no such body as the &quot;Catholic Beneficial Society&quot; in Teresa's diocese. However, there is a &quot;Catholic Benevolent Society&quot; and Teresa was a lifelong member of this society. It is an unincorporated body whose purposes were to provide any necessary assistance to members of the diocese and their families and to provide a meeting place and to provide social activities for Catholic members of the diocese.
<p>
The Bishop of the diocese has also applied to the court on behalf of the Catholic Benevolent Society. He is asking for guidance on the validity of this trust. 
<p>
<b>The judge who is to hear this application has asked you to prepare a bench memo. In addition to addressing the validity of the legacies under the relevant law, she also wants you to comment critically on any areas where there may be reasons to reconsider the legal position on a given issue.</b>

<h3>Question Four (15 Marks)</h3>

Susan was a journalist. She had a twenty year old daughter named Lisa who she had raised on her own. Lisa was at university now, but she returned home to live with Susan during the summers. They lived in rental housing for many years. However, in 1990, Susan decided that it was time for her to buy a house. She was fortunate enough to happen on a Victorian house that she loved. However it was more expensive than she had anticipated and it required a substantial amount of work. Susan's mother had always told her that she would help her with a house and so Susan asked her mother if she might consider making a contribution. Susan's mother readily agreed and contributed $10,000 towards the purchase price.
<p>
Susan and her mother did not ever discuss paying back the money, perhaps because it was clear that Susan had spent virtually all of her savings on the house and she was currently spending most of her income on mortgage payments and renovations.
<p>
In 1991, Susan met Pat. They hit it off immediately and Pat soon moved into Susan's house. In 1993, Susan was investigating a series of articles about a very wealthy businessman with reputed links to organized crime. She was concerned about the possibility of a libel action and she knew that the magazine maintained very limited libel coverage. Therefore, on the advice of the magazine's lawyer, she transferred the house to Lisa and Pat, as tenants in common in equal shares. However, Susan's fears were unfounded and no libel action was ever launched or even threatened.
<p>
Unfortunately, Susan was killed in a mysterious car accident some months after her series appeared. In her will, Susan left a number of legacies, providing for Lisa, her mother, and some other relations. Her will was made before she purchased the house and so it made no mention either of the house or of Pat. Susan left the residue of her estate to PEN International, a registered Canadian charity.
<p>
Susan's father, who is the executor of her estate, has asked Lisa and Pat to convey the property to him so that it can be included in the estate and administered under the terms of the will. Lisa and Pat have both refused to do so. They both claim a property interest in the house. Susan's mother has also made a claim that she is entitled to 10% of the value of the house because of the $10,000 she gave Susan (the purchase price of the house was $100,000)
<p>
<b>Susan's father has consulted you to determine whether Pat, Lisa or Susan's mother can claim any interest in respect of the house. Please advise him on this matter.</b>

<h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
<ol><i>
<li>This is a take-home examination. It can be picked up at any of the times posted on the bulletin board by Pat Ward.<p>
<li>There is only one restriction on the materials you may use. Because not everyone can have simultaneous access to library materials, I would prefer that you not use anything from the library collection. Previously taken photocopies do not violate the letter or spirit of this rule.<p>
<li>In accordance with the Faculty Council resolution of Oct. 6, 1993, you may consult with other students in the course of working out your answer. However, please note that this resolution also provides that &quot;the answer or answers returned by the students must be organized and written by that student alone&quot;. I ask that you follow the spirit, as well as the letter of this rule.<p>
<li>There are two parts. The first part consists of questions to be answered true/false, with an explanation, and there are 9 questions, each worth 2 marks (except for question 9, which is worth 4 marks). The second part is a single question worth 80 marks. Note carefully that there is a word limit of 3500 words for the whole exam. <b>Anything which you write in excess of 3500 words will not be read.</b> Be forewarned that this penalty will be enforced with absolute strictness, in fairness to those students who make a conscientious effort to observe the word limit. In the past, I have downgraded at least two &quot;A&quot; papers to a &quot;C&quot; for significantly exceeding the word limit, and have downgraded many more a half or a whole grade. l make word count estimates for every paper (this is not a bluff: I hire a graduate student to do word counts): you should make your own word count estimate and <b>put this on the font of your answer.</b><p>
<li>I would prefer that you type your examination answer. However, this is not required. If you write your answer, <b>please</b> make sure that it is legible, and written on <b>every other line</b>. If you choose, you may submit a handwritten copy of your answer and later submit a typed copy, within a week (or, if the law school closes before a week has elapsed from the date when you wrote the exam, then on the first day of classes when the law school reopens in January. However, if you intend to do so, please mark in a clearly visible place on your handwritten copy, &quot;TYPED COPY TO FOLLOW&quot;.
<p>
Typewritten copies of already submitted exam answers will be checked for accuracy against the handwritten original. If any part of your handwritten copy is illegible, then the typed part which corresponds with that part <b>will not be read</b>. If anything of substance appears in the typewritten copy which does not appear in the handwritten original, your exam will not be read, period.<p>
<li>I place a high premium on <b>organization and clarity</b>. Answers which have been well thought out and well organized typically receive a higher grade.<p>
<li>You may feel that in answering the question you sometimes have to cover the same material twice. Rather than repeating yourself, feel free to incorporate by reference part of your earlier discussion.<p>
<li>You need deal only with those issues raised in the course!<p>
<li>You may assume that all corporations in this exam are incorporated under the OBCA, unless otherwise indicated.<p>
<li>Feel free to use point form if that helps you economize on your total word count. Note, however, that this can interfere with the flow and comprehensibility of your answer.<p>
<li>Please do NOT use footnotes (or endnotes). All of your answer (including case names, etc.) should go into the text. This makes for easier reading.
</i></ol>

<p><br>
<h3>PART I (20 marks; 2 marks per question, except 4 marks for question 9)<p>
INDICATE WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS ARE TRUE OR FALSE: BRIEFLY EXPLAIN YOUR CHOICE (AGAIN, POINT FORM IS SATISFACTORY).</h3>
<ol>
<li>In a memorandum of association jurisdiction, the memorandum of association may transfer the power to declare dividends to a committee of shareholders.
<p>
<li>The directors may declare dividends only in cash or property of the corporation.
<p>
<li>Preferred shares necessarily have <b>both</b> a preferential right (vis-a-vis the common shares) to the income stream and a preferential right to assets on winding up.
<p>
<li>The directors may create series of shares within a class, such that the various series of shares do not have identical rights.
<p>
<li>At common law, majority shareholder ratification of directorial wrongdoing constitutes a complete bar to a shareholder suit.
<p>
<li>A dissident shareholder wishing to solicit shareholders must send a dissident's shareholder circular to all shareholders of the corporation.
<p>
<li>Under a unanimous shareholders' agreement transferring some or all of the directors' powers to a committee of shareholders, the shareholders assume fiduciary duties to the company and to other shareholders.
<p>
<li>A corporation may have the following share structure:
<p>
Class A shares: 10 votes per share, but not entitled to receive any dividends or any of the property of the corporation upon dissolution.
<p>
Class B shares: Non-voting, entitled to receive a preferential dividend of $5 per share before any other class of shares is entitled to receive a dividend, and entitled to return of stated capital plus $10 upon winding up or dissolution.
<p>
Class C shares: Non-voting, with right to receive dividends as declared by the directors after payment of any preferential dividend, and residual claim to the property of the corporation upon winding up or dissolution.
<p>
<li>ABC Corp. proposes an amalgamation between itself and XYZ Corp. Both ABC and XYZ have two classes of shares: voting common shares and non-voting preferred shares. Under the terms of the amalgamation, the preferred shares of both ABC and XYZ would be replaced by new classes of preferred shares in Amalco, the corporation formed from the merger of ABC and XYZ. The preferred shares given to the preferred shareholders of ABC would be exactly the same as they had before, except that they will be subordinated in their entitlement to dividends and assets on winding up to the class of preferred shares given to the preferred shareholders of XYZ. The class of preferred shares in Amalco given to the preferred shareholders of XYZ will be identical in all respects to those they had before. The preferred shareholders of ABC may submit a shareholder proposal relating to the amalgamation, but the preferred shareholders of XYZ may not.
</ol><p><br>
<h3>PART II</h3>
Emperor's New Clothes Corp. (referred to below as &quot;ENC Corp.&quot;) makes clothing. It has one class of common shares, which trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Fran Farkle, the founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairwoman of the board of directors of ENC Corp., owns 20% of the 100,000 issued and outstanding common shares. The rest of the shares are widely held, including however 6 blocks of 5% held by institutional investors (i.e. banks, insurance companies, etc.; these are referred to below as the &quot;institutional blockholders&quot;). ENC Corp. manufactures clothes.
<p>
Farkle desired to invest money in a new business but was strapped for cash. She had also heard rumours that a hostile takeover bid for ENC was in the offing. At a board meeting described below, she therefore proposed that the corporation do a &quot;dual class recapitalization&quot;, pursuant to which the existing common equity would be divided into two classes, one voting, and the other non-voting. Under this proposal, each holder of 1 common share would receive 1 Class A common share, which would have 1 vote per share, and 10 Class B common shares, which would be non-voting. Aside from voting rights, the two classes of shares would be identical in all respects (e.g. re entitlement to dividends, assets on winding up, etc.). Both classes would be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Farkle then planned to sell all of her Class B shares over the stock exchange, and use part of the proceeds to purchase (also over the stock exchange) a majority of the Class A shares. This would not only consolidate her control, but would leave part of the proceeds of the sale of her Class B shares to invest in her new business.
<p>
The board of directors of ENC consists of 9 directors, 4 of whom are &quot;insiders&quot; (i.e. officers of ENC), and 5 of whom are &quot;outsiders&quot; (i.e. not officers of ENC). Of these five outsiders, two are past business associates of Fran Farkle who have no current business ties to either Farkle or ENC Corp. One is the CEO of a large corporation, who also has no current business ties either to Farkle or ENC Corp. The fourth serves as lawyer to both Farkle and ENC Corp., while the fifth is a current business partner of Farkle (in an unrelated business venture).
<p>
The board initially met for two hours to consider Farkle's proposal for a dual class recapitalization. During this meeting Farkle indicated that she was short of cash and the recapitalization would solve this problem. She also indicated that she had heard rumours that there might be a takeover bid for ENC Corp. She expressed the view that this would be highly disruptive to the staff of ENC, and would jeopardize ENC's long-range business plan to expand ENC's clothing business into a new line of &quot;punker&quot; styles to be marketed to teens and young adults. This plan had been roundly criticized in the trade press and Farkle expressed the view that the market had completely failed to understand the genius behind this move. She felt that if a hostile acquisition occurred, her brilliant strategy to move into punker styles would likely be scrapped.
<p>
The lawyer/director suggested that it would be a good idea to constitute a committee of independent directors to investigate the wisdom of the dual class recapitalization. This was done. The committee was asked to make a report to the full board. The lawyer/director was deputized by the board to give the independent committee its marching orders. The lawyer instructed the committee to assume that the move into punker styles would be a good idea, that this plan could be jeopardized by a hostile acquisition, and to make a recommendation on whether the recapitalization would be an appropriate response. He also instructed the committee to investigate and report on whether the rumours of an impending takeover bid were seriously affecting employee morale.
<p>
After a short organizational meeting, each member of the committee talked to employees of the company and made such other further inquiries as each considered appropriate. These ranged from nothing at all, to conversations with clothing industry experts at various investment banking houses about town. Following these inquiries, the committee met for two hours and discussed the results of their investigations. They then unanimously reported to the full board that the employees of ENC were indeed unsettled by the takeover rumours, and that a dual class recapitalization would be a good way to protect ENC's long-range plan to move into punker styles. The full board then unanimously endorsed Farkle's plan to recapitalize the company. The formal resolution adopted by the board read in part:
<blockquote>
In consideration of Fran Farkle's financial position and desire to sell shares to raise cash, and in consideration of the need to protect the corporation's long-term strategy from the potential effects of a hostile acquisition, and in consideration of the unsettling effect that rumours of an impending takeover have had on the employees of ENC, the board hereby resolves to [effect the dual class recapitalization]...
</blockquote>
A special shareholders' meeting was called to approve the plan. A management circular was put together and sent to shareholders. The circular stressed the need to protect the corporation's long-term plans, and the adverse affect that takeover rumours were having on employee morale, but said nothing about Farkle's personal motives for favouring the recapitalization, nor that after the recapitalization she planned to buy up a majority of the voting shares (although that is often what happens following such a recapitalization).
<p>
Farkle was extremely active in attempting to get the major shareholders (i.e. the institutional shareholders) to vote in favour of the plan. She personally met with representatives of each large institutional shareholder. In doing so, she stressed that she was meeting with them as a shareholder, rather than as a representative of management, and that as the largest single shareholder in ENC, she felt strongly that the recapitalization was necessary to preserve the corporation's long run value.
<p>
The shareholders approved the plan. 70% of the shareholders voted in person or by proxy, including Farkle's 20% and the 30% held by the large institutional blockholders (each holding 5%). Farkle voted in favour, as did two of the institutional blockholders. Of the remaining 20% of the shareholders who voted, 85% voted in favour of the plan. Thus, in total 67% of the voting shareholders voted in favour of the plan.
<p>
Following implementation of the plan, Farkle did what she had intended to do: she sold all of her Class B shares into the market and bought up enough Class A shares to give her 50.1% of the Class A shares. She invested the rest of the money in her new business venture.
<p>
The new venture, called Zippity-Do-Dads Inc., involves the manufacture of zippers, buttons, and other types of fastening devices for clothes. Farkle owns 51% of the equity. The other 49% was sold to public shareholders (both institutional and retail) in a public offering. Zippity trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
<p>
Because Farkle was anxious to avoid any conflict between her duties as CEO of ENC and her involvement in the new enterprise, she declined to become either a director or officer of Zippity. However, she has been hired by Zippity in the capacity of consultant, with her remuneration paid entirely in generous options to buy the stock of Zippity (such that, if Zippity is successful, her remuneration as consultant could conceivably exceed that of the top executives of Zippity).
<p>
Farkle was optimistic that the business would be successful. ENC did not manufacture any fastening devices itself, but purchased them from external suppliers. Because ENC had been experiencing problems with these suppliers (e.g. too many broken fasteners, uninspired designs, etc.), Farkle hoped that ENC would take on Zippity-Do-Dads as its supplier.
<p>
This, indeed, was what happened. Farkle indicated to the board that it was her hope that ENC would purchase from Zippity. She also indicated that because she was an interested person, she could take no part in the decision. The board instructed the independent committee to investigate the virtues of Zippity versus other fastener suppliers. The committee members again made independent investigations, met together to discuss their findings, and then unanimously reported to the full board that Zippity had more interesting and reliable fasteners than its competitors, and sold them at prices competitive with other potential suppliers. The board as a whole decided to engage Zippity, and a contract was entered into pursuant to which Zippity agreed to supply ENC with fasteners of various kinds over a ten year period.
<p>
Indeed, Zippity's fasteners have become so successful that the demand for its product far outstrips the supply. Because the contract obliged Zippity to supply a large part of its current output to ENC, ENC secured an important advantage over its competitors by signing the long-term contract with Zippity.
<p>
Zippity is fast on its way to becoming one of the most profitable companies in Canada. Given Farkle's investment in Zippity, the value of her stock options, and the current market value of Zippity, her personal wealth is now treble what it was prior to the creation of Zippity, and increasing daily.
<p>
Please discuss any legal issues which you believe are reasonably raised by this fact situation (including who might sue whom, on what grounds, and for what relief).

<dd>The Attorney General of Flavelle is interested in constructing a system to deal with public complaints against judges. In the last year, there have been numerous complaints about the conduct of judges in Flavelle. Complaints have been made by lawyers, administrative staff and members of the public. They contain allegations ranging from discourteous service and excessive delay, to erratic behaviour, conflict of interest and sexual harassment. One well-publicized complaint concerned allegations of sexual harassment made by a judge's former administrative assistant ten years after her contact with the judge ended, but within a year of receiving counselling concerning the effects of the harassment.
<p>
<dd>Write a memorandum for the Attorney General outlining an appropriate structure for dealing with complaints against judges. You should make clear what role you contemplate within this system for negotiation, mediation, various forms of adjudication and public inquiries. You should also consider the implications of judicial independence and power imbalances when devising your system to deal with complaints. The Attorney General is also concerned about what role, if any, statutes of limitations should play in the system you have devised.

<h3>QUESTION ONE</h3>
Aware of your precocious insight into the civil justice system, you have been contacted by the Ontario Law Reform Commission. As part of its review of Alternative Dispute Resolution procedures it would like you to make some suggestions about the best way for it to deal with the thorny problem of how to decide which types of disputes are most appropriately dealt with by which kind of procedures. It also asks if you could provide some practical illustrations to bolster your more general analysis. What would you write?
<p><br>
<h3>QUESTION TWO</h3>
(A) Marie represents Charlie in a tortious action against Bill and represents Sanjeev in a tortuous action brought against him by Susan. Both actions come up for trial on the sane day. In the Doming, Mane intends to argue for Charlie that the limitation period does not begin to run until the extent of damage is realised. In the afternoon, on almost identical facts, Marie intends to argue for Sanjeev that the limitation period begins to run immediately from the occurrence of the negligent act.
<p>
(B) B.I.G. Corporation is an important client of Marie's firm in which she is a four-year associate. She is asked by its President to represent him personally in a civil action against him by a former spouse for domestic assault. He says that she wants Marie to defend him as it will look a lot better if he has a woman for a lawyer. Although her membership has lapsed, Marie was once a member of W.A.V.E. (Woman Against Violence Everywhere) and still has strong views on the subject.
<p>
(C) Marie has acted successfully for Irnya in recent litigation who collects a damage award of $25,000. A month later, Marie is sent anonymously an authenticated letter of Irnya' s which indicates that Irnya lied at the trial about a crucial issue in the case.
<p>
<b>What would you advise Marie to do? What would <i>you</i> do? Why?</b>
<p><br>
<h3>QUESTION THREE</h3>
Jack is a thoroughly bad lot. In the past few years, much of his past is beginning to catch up wish him snag he it the named defendant in a series of civil actions:
<blockquote>
(A) Katrina, his 30 year old step-daughter, sues over incestuous incidents that go back over 20 years. She had gone through therapy and had begun to come to terms with her situation about years ago. However, Jack's return to Toronto from B.C. has stirred up her anxiety, she has become depressed and serves Jack a couple of weeks ago. Jack's lawyer seeks to have the action set aside as being out of time, and
<p>
(B) Jack was involved in a car accident in November, 1993 in which Allan and Barbara were
killed. There were protracted discussions with Jack's insurance company which informally conceded liability in a 'without prejudice' communication, but disputed the quantum of damages. Due to the insurance company's failure to conclude any negotiations, Barbara's estate issued an originating process against Jack in May, 1995. The lawyer for Barbara's estate decided not to serve the originating process until she had received fiber medical reports on the nervous condition of Barbara's husband. In the meantime, Allan's estate issued an originating process against Jack in October, 1995. This originating process has not yet been served. A week age the lawyer for Barbara's estate realized that the originating process had expired. She was successful in making an ex parte motion for an extension of
time for service. Jack's lawyer moves to set aside the order for extension. 
</blockquote>
<b>Both these motions are brought before you today as the presiding judge. How would you dispose of them?</b>
<p>
<dd>[Assume that the relevant limitation period in both cases is 2 years]

<dd>The spotted orange otter is an endangered species still found in a few places in Northern Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba. Wildlife experts fear that if swift action is not taken to protect the remaining animals, the species will die out, and Canada will be the poorer.
<p>
<dd>The federal Minister of the Environment has been under a great deal of pressure from SPOTTER (The Society to Protect the Spotted Otter) to act not only to save the spotted orange otter, but other endangered species as well. They argue that the federal Parliament should enact an <cite>Endangered Species Act</cite> in order to live up to its obligations under the <cite>International Agreement to Save Endangered Species</cite>. That treaty requires signatories, like Canada, to take steps to protect an agreed list of endangered species, which includes the spotted orange otter.
<p>
<dd>You are a lawyer for the federal Ministry. The Minister is inclined to meet SPOTTER's demands, but needs your help in determining the possible constitutional issues that may arise from the enactment of SPOTTER's proposed legislation, which is described below.
<p>
<dd>The legislation would create an offense, punishable with a large fine, for anyone to kill or harm an endangered species, as designated in the regulations (and which would include the spotted orange otter). The law would also give the power to the federal Minister of the Environment to issue regulations to protect the habitat of such species.
<p>
<dd>With respect to the spotted orange otter, the proposed regulations would include identifying certain zones to be refuges for the otters. Public access to these zones would be controlled by federal wildlife officers - but some access by the public would be allowed in order to promote awareness about these wonderful creatures. As well, the federal officers would be given the power, within these zones, to eliminate the natural predators of the otter, which are the wolf and coyote.
<p>
<dd>The provinces of Ontario and Quebec have registered opposition to any federal intervention in this area. Both claim that wildlife conservation is within provincial jurisdiction, since the provinces have extensive responsibility for natural resources and public property.
<p>
<dd>Ontario and Quebec (but not Manitoba) already have systems to protect the spotted orange otter. Their <cite>Wildlife Acts</cite> prevent hunting of any species without a licence, and no licence is available to hunt the spotted orange otter. Both have designated a number of refuges for these animals. These provinces fundamentally disagree with the federal proposal to allow public access to otter refuges, however, since they believe that the greatest danger to this species is destruction of their habitat by human beings. Most importantly, the provinces want to minimize damage to the northern lingonberry patches found in the refuges, since this berry is the sole food source of the spotted otter. Therefore, no member of the public is allowed access to provincial otter zones in order to protect the food.
<p>
<dd>The Minister asks you to advise her on the federalism issues that may arise if she proceeds with SPOTTER's proposal.

Mr. Jack Daniels is the owner and operator of Jack's Bar and Grill, a tavern located in the town of Brantford, Ontario. He has a cigarette vending machine in his tavern. He also sells cigarettes to youth, so long as they are over the age of 18. In so doing, he is acting in compliance with existing federal legislation.
<p>
The relevant provisions of the federal <cite>Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act</cite>, S.C. 1993, c. 5, are as follows:
<blockquote>
<center><h4>PURPOSE</h4></center>
<b>3.</b> The purpose of this Act is to protect the health of young persons by restricting their access to tobacco in light of the risks associated with tobacco consumption.
<p>
<center><h4>OFFENCES</h4></center>
<b>4.(1)</b> Everyone who, in the course of business, sells any tobacco product to a person under the age of eighteen is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars...
<p>
<b>5.(1)</b> Subject to subsection (2), everyone who installs, or permits to be installed, a vending machine in any public place knowing that tobacco products will be sold therefrom is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine not exceeding two thousand dollars.
<p>
<b> (2)</b> Subsection (1) does not apply in respect of a place that is a bar, tavern or other similar beverage room.
</blockquote>
However, Mr. Daniels has not complied with the recently enacted Ontario <cite>Tobacco Control Act</cite>, S.O. 1994, c. 7. The relevant sections of the Ontario Act are as follows:
<p>
<blockquote>
<center><h4>PURPOSE</h4></center>
<b>2.</b> In light of the dangers to health posed by the consumption of tobacco products, the purpose of this Act is to prevent the provision of tobacco to young persons and to regulate its sale and use.
<p>
<center><h4>PROVISION OF TOBACCO TO PERSONS UNDER NINETEEN</h4></center>
<b>3.(1)</b> No person shall sell or give tobacco to a person who is less than nineteen years of age.
<p>
<center><h4>VENDING MACHINES</h4></center>
<b>7.(1)</b> No person shall permit a vending machine for selling or dispensing tobacco products to be in a place that the person owns or occupies...
<p>
<center><h4>OFFENCES</h4></center>
<b>14.(1)</b> A person who contravenes subsection 3(1) or 7(1) is guilty of an offence and on conviction is liable to a fine not exceeding two thousand dollars...
</blockquote>
Other sections of the Ontario Act prohibit the sale of tobacco in pharmacies, hospitals, other health-care facilities. schools. and universities.
<p>
In early December 1995, Mr. Daniels was charged with offences pursuant to ss. 3(1) and 7(1) of the Ontario <cite>Tobacco Control Act</cite>. You are an articling student for a lawyer representing Mr. Daniels. Prepare a memorandum discussing and evaluating any constitutional arguments that might assist Mr. Daniels in his defence.
<p>
For the purposes of this memorandum: (a) you are not to consider any arguments that could be made in reliance of the <cite>Constitution Act, 1982</cite>; and (b) you are to assume that Mr. Daniels has violated ss. 3(1) and 7(1) of the Ontario Act and that he has complied with the federal Act.

<dd>The spotted orange otter is an endangered species now found in only a few places in northern Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba. Ontario and Quebec have implemented programmes to protect the otter, but wildlife experts fear that the species will die out without federal government action. These experts maintain that it is important to preserve species diversity as a commitment to the environment, to sustainable development and to pride in our rich natural heritage.
<p>
<dd>The Society to Protect the Spotted Otter, &quot;SPOTTER&quot;, has been lobbying the federal Minister of the Environment to propose new federal legislation, in the form of an <cite>Endangered Species Act</cite>, to protect the spotted orange otter as part of a more general programme to protect endangered species. SPOTTER takes the position that Parliament is obligated to enact such legislation to fulfil its obligations under the <cite>International Agreement to Save Endangered Species</cite>, a treaty that requires its signatories to take steps to protect a listed number of endangered species, including the spotted orange otter.
<p>
<dd>The proposed legislation would empower the federal Minister of the Environment, by regulation, to designate certain species as endangered and to provide protection for such species, including the provision of protected habitats. Once the spotted orange otter and its habitat acquired this designation, federal wildlife officers would have the authority to restrict entry to the areas designated and, as necessary, remove or destroy the otter's natural predators -- the wolf and coyote. Enforcement would include the prohibition of killing, harming, having in possession or selling an animal identified as belonging to an endangered species and non-authorized entry into the habitat of an endangered species. Punishment set for first offences is a low fine; for repeat offences of a serious nature, punishment is set at higher fines and/or imprisonment.
<p>
<dd>Opposition to the proposal has come from several quarters. The provinces of Ontario and Quebec take the position that wildlife conservation is within provincial jurisdiction and that they are doing a good job. Public interests groups, under the banner &quot;Get a Life&quot;, insist that the programme is bad politics in a time of spending cutbacks to social programmes for human beings. They demand that the legislation include some features to recapture expenditures, such as making the habitats available, for a fee, to nature protection groups, students, tourists, etc. They note that it would be possible to sell souvenirs, calendars and books at the sites to these visitors. Other critics take the view that there is no point in protecting animals that no one can see or learn about first hand.
<p>
<dd>Ontario and Quebec, as noted earlier, have legislation in place to protect the spotted orange otter. Pursuant to this legislation, these provinces require a licence for hunting particular animals and no longer issue licences in respect to this animal. In addition, both provinces have designated a number of protected habitats for it. These provinces prohibit public access to such areas on the view that any human traffic will damage the northern ligon berry patches, which provide the otter with its sole source of food. Signs to this effect are posted but no officials are on site.
<p>
<dd>You are a lawyer for the Ministry of the Environment. The Minister is inclined to support enactment of the proposed legislation. The government favours a national &quot;feel good&quot; programme at this time but is concerned that constitutional difficulties may arise. Prepare a brief memorandum for the Minister setting out the federalism issues implicated, ranking their strength, and indicating how the Supreme Court of Canada would likely resolve them. Include suggestions as to how to bolster the arguments for federal jurisdiction.

Esther and Stephen Dickinson are 73 and 70 years old. When they retired ten years ago, they sold their house in the city and moved into their country home on Georgian Bay. Their first years in the country were pure bliss, but the last few have been more difficult. Their old age brought along various health problems, and they have been finding it increasingly difficult to live on their own; household chores, property maintenance and errands have become a little much for them. Moreover, Esther and Stephen's son, Sylvio, has been worried about his parents living on their own in such a remote location. Sylvio hence suggested that Esther and Stephen move back to the city and live in a fully serviced home for senior citizens. Having always been fiercely independent, Esther and Stephen rejected this idea out of hand. Instead, they decided they would hire someone to help with the housekeeping, cooking, and driving, and to be generally available in case of emergency. This would require that this person live nearby, and it was therefore also decided that a fully equipped, winterized cottage would be built for this person's use just a few hundred yards from the house. Once the construction of the cottage was completed, Esther and Stephen went on a search for the perfect household helper.
<p>
<dd>Upon Sylvio's recommendation, they hired on a trial basis Sylvio's sister-in-law, Teresa, an experienced nurse who was unemployed at the time. Teresa and her son Tommy moved into the cottage, and after a mutually satisfactory three-week trial period, Esther, Stephen and Teresa decided to formalize their arrangement. They entered a written contract whereby Teresa agreed to be available weekdays for housekeeping, cooking, driving and emergencies, as requested by Esther and Stephen from time to time, in exchange for which she would receive $20.00 for every hour of actual services and she and Tommy would be allowed to live in the cottage rent-free. The contract also provided that Teresa would notify Esther and Stephen in advance when she would need to go out, and would not work for anyone else for the duration of the contract (2 years)
<p>.
<dd>Two days after the contract was concluded, Teresa realized that no minimal number of hours of services had been set in the contract, which would leave her with very few hours of services--and hence very little money--in those weeks where Esther and Stephen might not need much help. She mentioned her concern to Esther and Stephen who told her not to worry, for they would definitely need her services on a daily basis. Just to reassure Teresa, however, Esther and Stephen told her they could guarantee her a minimum of three hours a day.
<p>
<dd>All went well, until six months into the contract, when Esther and Stephen's son, Sylvio, got divorced, lost his job and, in an attempt to save housing money, decided to come to live with his parents. With Sylvio in the house, Teresa's services were no longer needed on a steady basis. She would be called upon for a few hours of work every now and then, but never more than six hours in any one week. In need of additional income, Teresa started working part-time at the local public library. Esther and Stephen found out about it and told her to move out of the cottage, as she had breached her contract with them. She tried to explain to them that the reason she had to find alternative employment was that they had failed to give her the minimum of fifteen hours of services they had promised her, but they refuse to discuss the matter.
<p>
<dd>Advise Teresa. Please ignore possible labour and family law issues.

Olympus and Stork Ltd. (O &amp; S), commercial real estate developers, decided to construct a high-rise office tower in downtown Toronto during the late 1980's real estate boom and called for tenders from prime contractors against a detailed set of specifications developed by O &amp; S's architectural and engineering consultants. O &amp; S awarded the construction contract to Ron Ellis Construction Ltd. (REC), a Canadian subsidiary of a
major multinational construction company, for a fixed price of $50 million, full completion required within two years from the signing of the contract.
<p>
At an early stage of construction, REC encountered severe sub-soil conditions (uncovering an old toxic waste site dump that had caused extensive soil contamination problems) that made the foundation work much more costly and protracted than expected. REC demanded an additional amount of $10 million from O &amp; S in the absence of which REC intimated that it was likely to repudiate the contract by declaring bankruptcy. Senior management of O &amp; S reluctantly agreed to the additional payment.
<p>
The office complex was eventually completed but nine months late. During that period, a severe economic recession had set in in Canada and the real estate market had become severely depressed. Shanghai Bank, which had initially agreed to lease several floors of the building at attractive rents, repudiated the lease on account of the delay in completion and decided to withdraw from the Canadian market. Other prospective tenants with whom O &amp; S had been negotiating lease arrangements broke off negotiations in the face of uncertainty over the completion date and subsequently leased cheaper space elsewhere.
<p>
O &amp; S now sues REC for the difference between its current rental revenues and the revenues it claims it would have realized with timely completion of the building. REC counterclaims for the additional payment of $10 million, for which O &amp; S now denies liability.
<p>
If you were retained as counsel for REC, how would you argue their case?

<ol><i>
<li>You may consult any kind of material you wish during the exam, for example, notes, the casebook, and texts, except books owned by the library<p>

<center><h4>MEMORANDUM</h4></center>
TO: Associates-at-Law<p>
FROM: GKH<p>
Richard Lopez recently called me seeking our advice about a housing deal he is working on. He has given me the following information.
<p>
Lopez is sixty-four years old and recently retired from his wholesale tobacco business. As part of the deal when he sold his business, he took a vacant lot on Woolsack Avenue; his dream is to build a small apartment complex on the lot.
<p>
From a financial standpoint, Lopez is not unreasonable in permitting himself to think in terms of apartment construction. He has accumulated a comfortable estate in his years of business, and by mortgaging the premises for about fifty percent of its cost--which he estimates will be $1,200,000. at the most--he figures that the investment is one that he can afford to make.
<p>
On August 14th, Lopez got a call from his old and wealthy friend Bill Sing and was invited to join him for lunch. The lunch was barely under way when Lopez launched into a description of his dream to build the apartment complex. Sing was both enthusiastic and encouraging.
<p>
&quot;Wonderful idea, Rick,&quot; said Sing. &quot;Best investment you could possibly make. And don't let high prices worry you. Take my word for it, in a few years these prices everyone is yelling about will look dirt cheap. The dollar is on the way down. Get your money in property now and you can't go wrong.&quot;
<p>
With the conversation turned to costs and financing, Lopez explained that of course he expected to put a mortgage of approximately $600,000 on the property. He asked Sing for his advice on the best places to apply for such a loan, the maximum rate of interest he should pay, and the terms he should seek.
<p>
&quot;Rick, I'll tell you,&quot; said Sing after a few moments of thought. &quot;You can get a loan without trouble, I'm sure; probably twenty years at 11% interest will do it. But when you have that kind of a loan hanging over your head, you're never free from worry. You can't expect sympathy from a big lending institution; business is business with them. Now I'll tell you what I'll do. Twenty years ago you did me a favor I'll never forget when you loaned me that $10,000 I needed to get my own business going and I told you then that someday I'd repay you and I meant it. Let me lend you that $600,000 you need. I'll take your mortgage, but I'll make it for twenty-five years with no required annual payments and you can pay it off as you get the money. And forget about interest. I mean it, Rick, and don't say no.&quot;
<p>
Lopez, registered the customary protests: that he couldn't take advantage of Sing's generosity; that this was a pure gift and much too large a one.
<p>
&quot;Look, Rick,&quot; replied Sing, &quot;Don't be a fool. Believe me, I can afford it. And it isn't a gift; I expect you to repay it and I know you will. And if it will make you feel better when you're taking the profits to the bank in a few years, you can always add some interest to the repayments.&quot; With this remark Sing chuckled loudly and slapped Lopez on the back. &quot;What's more, I'm getting security for the loan, and good security. Shake hands on it and get going on your building. The longer you delay, the more it's going to cost you.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Bill,&quot; said Lopez at last, &quot;I shouldn't take advantage of you this way, but I'm going to take you up. With this help from you I can't miss. You're a real friend, Bill, I will never forget it. Probably I won't be needing any of your cash for a while, but when I do, I'll count on you for up to $600,000 on a twenty-five year mortgage--of course I'll pay it off long before then-hopefully with interest.
<p>
&quot;You can count on me, Rick,&quot; said Sing. &quot;And don't talk about taking advantage of me. Let's shake on it.&quot; The two men shook hands and Lopez raised a toast: &quot;To the best friend a man could hope for. And in return, lunch is on me.&quot;
<p>
10 days later Lopez received a letter from Sing:
<blockquote>
Dear Rick,
<p>
<dd>I'm afraid I have bad news for you. After checking my affairs on my return here the day before yesterday, I discovered that I was a bit too hasty in my offer to lend you $600,000 on a 25-year mortgage on your proposed apartment building. The fact is that I just don't see how I can free enough of my funds at this time to make this advance to you.
<p>
<dd>Believe me, I feel very badly at having to let you down this way, but I have no alternative. And, after all, it won't seriously affect your project, since I know you'll have no trouble getting a loan through regular sources, and your building as you described it to me should easily earn more than enough to take care of the interest which I realize you'll have to pay.
<p>
<dd>I'm sure you'll understand that I have no choice in this matter. Please drop me a line in the near future and let me know how your building is coming along. I'll be most interested to hear.
<p>
<dd>As ever,
<p>
<dd>Bill
</blockquote>
Lopez has asked us whether or not he can enforce Sing's promise to loan him the money and on what terms. He has told me that he spent the week following his lunch with Sing working 10 hours a day researching zoning, architects, forecasts in the real estate market etc., and turned down an offer from his trust company for a $600,000 mortgage at 8% just days before he got Sing's letter. Is it worth his effort to pursue this claim? (For purposes of answering this question you should assume that a mortgage is a loan secured by a piece of real property. If the borrower fails to pay according to the terms of the loan, the lender has the right to force a sale of the property and collect from the proceeds the amount owing on the loan.)

<p>
<hr>
<p><br>
(25 marks) 1. Miss C, a resident of Ontario, incorporated Opco in Ontario in 1985. On incorporation, Miss C subscribed for 15 common shares of Opco and paid, in the aggregate, $150,000 in cash. On the issuance of the 15 common shares, the directors of Opco added $150,000 to the stated capital account for the shares. In 1986 Opco purchased for cancellation 5 of the 15 common shares held by Miss C for $60,000.
<p>
Opco declined in value and in 1989 Miss C sold her remaining 10 common shares of Opco to Mr. B. a resident of Ontario, for $50,000. Mr. B immediately subscribed for 10 additional common shares and paid $50,000, the amount added by the directors to the stated capital amounts for the shares.
<p>
In 1990 Mr. B sold the 20 shares of Opco to Acquireco, a resident of the United States, for $10,000. In 1991 Acquireco made a contribution of capital to Opco in the account of $200,000.
<p>
Discuss the tax implications of each of the above events.
<p><br>
(50 marks) 2. Assume the above facts and that Opco now has a value of $1,000,000. Opco's only asset is land in northern Ontario. The cost of the land to Opco is $200,000. Acquireco wants to dispose of its investment to a Canadian public company (Pubco) and use the net proceeds in the United States. Acquireco is considering 4 possible methods of realization:
<blockquote>
(a) Acquireco could sell the shares of Opco to Pubco for $1,000,000 in cash.
<p>
(b) Acquireco could transfer the shares of Opco to Pubco which is in the business of real estate development in exchange for shares of Pubco having a value equal to $1,000,000. Acquireco and Pubco would elect under section 85 of the Income Tax Act at an amount which would result in Acquireco not realizing a capital gain on the transfer. Acquireco could then sell the shares of Pubco for $1,000,000. Pubco's shares are listed on The Toronto Stock Exchange and trade regularly.
<p>
(c) Acquireco could make a contribution of surplus to Opco in the amount of $2,000,000 and then sell the shares of Opco for $3,000,000.
<p>
(d) Opco could sell the land for $1,000,000 and distribute the net proceeds after tax to Acquireco.
</blockquote>
Discuss the tax implications of each of the above methods.
<p><br>
(25 marks) 3. Gertrude owns a capital property which has a cost to her of  $10,000 and a current fair market value of $100,000. She decides to transfer the property to a company (Holdco) and to elect a transfer price under section 85 of the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite> of $10,000. Gertrude's daughter, Gladys, is the only shareholder of Holdco immediately before the transfer by Gertrude.
<p>
Gertrude could receive from Holldco any of the following four packages of consideration.
<p>
Discuss the tax implications of each:
<blockquote>
(a)	cash - $10,000<br>
common shares - $90,000
<p>
(b) promissory note - $15,000<br>
preferred shares - $80,000<br>
common shares - $5,000
<p>
(c) promissory note - $4,000<br>
preferred shares - $5,000<br>
common shares - $50,000
<p>
(d) cash - $120,000

<dd>The police learn from a legal wiretap that Jones and Smith are planning to rob the very rich Mr. &amp; Mrs. Victim in their fancy new condominium. The police contact the concierge of the condominium and ask him to alert them if a particular car shows up with persons in it matching the description of Jones and Smith. They also alert Mr. and Mrs. Victim, who move to a hotel with all their valuables. When the car shows up a few days later, the concierge calls the police and then goes out to stall Jones and Smith. They become suspicious and Jones shoots the concierge in the chest. Smith is heard to shout: &quot;You said you wouldn't shoot anyone - that the gun was only to scare people.&quot; Jones and Smith leave.
<p>
<dd>The police arrive at the scene and unfortunately one of the cars drives over the concierge, crushing his skull. The concierge is dead when he arrives at the hospital. The coroner later says that the concierge would probably have survived the bullet wound.
<p>
<dd>Jones and Smith immediately drive to a home in Forest Hill and knock on the front door. Mr. Rich is home and answers the door. Jones says that &quot;this is a stick-up; we want your money from the safe.&quot; Smith stays in the front hall as a look-out. After Mr. Rich opens the safe, an alarm goes off. Smith shouts: &quot;Shoot him and let's get out of here.&quot; Jones shoots and kills Mr. Rich and they flee.
<p>
<dd>Several hours later, Jones is stopped by a police officer for emitting too much smoke from his car exhaust contrary to the new Federal Exhaust Emission Act. [Assume that there is such an Act.] The car is registered in Jones' name and Jones was driving the car. The Act provides that &quot;Anyone who emits more than [a certain density] of smoke from his or her car exhaust, whether or not the person knows that such an amount is being emitted, is guilty of a summary conviction offence.&quot; Jones' exhaust emission is above the legal limit. Jones claims that he had just had his car certified the day before because he was about to sell it and certainly did not know that such a quantity of smoke was being emitted. He didn't even know there was such an Act. While they were arguing, another officer spotted Jones and Smith as the suspects in the murders that day and arrested them.
<p>
<dd>You are an articling student in the Crown Attorney's office. The Crown Attorney would like a short memo from you on the possible offences that Jones and Smith may be guilty of, from first degree murders down. The Crown also wants you to give your opinion on whether Jones and Smith can be guilty of &quot;illegally emitting smoke&quot; from the car, in case the other charges fail. Please prepare the memorandum.

Assume that all these facts can be proved by the Crown.
<p>
Daryl Kreep is a 35 year-old man who makes a practice of hanging out in the parking lots of shopping malls where he waits until he spots a young woman with an armful of shopping bags, at which point he will deliberately bump into her knocking her parcels to the ground. He thereupon moves a few feet away and gets sexual gratification out of watching her bend over to pick up the parcels. He then moves off to find another victim.
<p>
This is precisely what he did one day last month when he bumped into the victim in this case, Laurel Smith. He moved away a few feet to watch her, but as she was bending over to pick up the parcels Kreep had knocked from her arms, a car driven by Gertrude Steyn, aged 74, suddenly accelerated and struck Laurel causing severe injuries from which she has now, however, recovered. Investigation revealed that Mrs. Steyn, while driving her car out of the parking lot, had suffered a minor, but painful heart attack which caused her suddenly and by reflex action to put her foot heavily on the accelerator. She, too, has now fully recovered.
<p>
You work in the Crown Attorney's office and your principal would like to charge Kreep with the most serious offence you can find that will stick. She wants you to write a memorandum (or, in this case, an examination answer) advising her what to proceed on, and what the chances of success will be. The possibilities are:
<p>
Simple assault under s. 266 of the Code;<br>
Assault causing bodily harm under s. 267(1)(b) of the Code;<br>
Sexual Assault under s. 271 of the Code; and<br>
Sexual Assault causing bodily harm under s. 272(c) of the Code.

<dd>Raskolnikov (R) lived alone in an old farmhouse situated on a road about 15 kilometres from Alliston, Ontario. While generally in good health, he had suffered since childhood from asthma, and on occasion would experience episodes during which he would have much difficulty in breathing. On these occasions it was always enough to take his prescribed medication to restore his breathing to normal.
<p>
<dd>Late one night during a severe thunderstorm, R heard frantic knocking at his door. It was Zossimov (Z), a total stranger to R. &quot;My car's broken down on the highway,&quot; Z said, &quot;and all the garages around here are closed for the night. I wonder if I could stay until morning - I won't be any trouble, I promise.&quot;
<p>
<dd>R agreed with hardly a moment's hesitation. As Z's clothes were soaking wet, R loaned him some of his own. He then fixed Z a hot meal, put fresh sheets on the bed in the guest room, and wished Z a good night.
<p>
<dd>About two hours later, Z was awakened by a cry coming from R's room. R had begun to experience some trouble breathing and on discovering that he had run out of medication, had called to Z for help. Z went to investigate. R entreated him to drive his car to an all-night pharmacy in Alliston, but Z refused, saying it was a miserable night and that, in any event, it was probably just a chest cold that would clear up by itself. He then gave R some cough syrup that he found in the medicine chest and told him to go to sleep and not to disturb him any more.
For the next forty-eight hours, while R's condition steadily worsened, Z ate R's food, lounged in his living room watching television, and slept in R's guest room. Occasionally he would give R tea and cough syrup, but that was it. By the morning of the third day, R was in a coma. Finally a neighbour dropped by and asked Z how R was. Z replied that R had been ill with a bad cold but that the worst seemed to be over now. The neighbour went in to see R and, immediately realizing the gravity of the situation, quickly carried R into his car and rushed him to the hospital in Alliston. There R's respiratory problem was successfully treated by emergency surgery, but a week later R died from a bacterial infection he contracted through the surgeon's failure to observe proper sanitary procedures.
<p>
<dd>As a result of police and psychiatric investigations, the following facts about Z have come to light. He is eighteen years old and of below average (but normal) intelligence. He dropped out of school after grade ten and has been continuously unemployed ever since. An only child, he lives with his parents who have always catered to his every whim, allowing the most trivial of them to override more substantial interests of their own. As a result, Z has developed a tendency to overestimate the importance of his own needs and to undervalue those of others. He staunchly maintains that he did not realize how serious R's condition was.
<p>
<dd>Discuss Z's criminal liability.

Assume that all these facts can be proved by the Crown.
<p>
Daryl Kreep is a 35 year-old man who makes a practice of hanging out in the parking lots of shopping malls where he waits until he spots a young woman with an armful of shopping bags, at which point he will deliberately bump into her knocking her parcels to the ground. He thereupon moves a few feet away and gets sexual gratification out of watching her bend over to pick up the parcels. He then moves off to find another victim.
<p>
This is precisely what he did one day last month when he bumped into the victim in this case, Laurel Smith. He moved away a few feet to watch her, but as she was bending over to pick up the parcels Kreep had knocked from her arms, a car driven by Gertrude Steyn, aged 74, suddenly accelerated and struck Laurel causing severe injuries from which she has now, however, recovered. Investigation revealed that Mrs. Steyn, while driving her car out of the parking lot, had suffered a minor, but painful heart attack which caused her suddenly and by reflex action to put her foot heavily on the accelerator. She, too, has now fully recovered.
<p>
You work in the Crown Attorney's office and your principal would like to charge Kreep with the most serious offence you can find that will stick. She wants you to write a memorandum (or, in this case, an examination answer) advising her what to proceed on, and what the chances of success will be. The possibilities are:
<p>
Simple assault under s. 266 of the Code;<br>
Assault causing bodily harm under s. 267(1)(b) of the Code;<br>
Sexual Assault under s. 271 of the Code; and<br>
Sexual Assault causing bodily harm under s. 272(c) of the Code.

<h4>QUESTION</h4>
<dd>AB, CD and EF are members of the Tronville University soccer team, which two months ago competed in Tronville for the Ontario Universities Soccer Federation Cup against the team from the University of Northern Ontario (UNO). The UNO team won, and became entitled to hold the cup for one year and payment of $200 to each player. After the game, AB, CD and EF decided to play a prank on GH, captain of the UNO team, by capturing the cup from the room GH had been given for the visit at Tronville University Graduate Students' Residence, and holding it until GH paid a ransom of $100 to a charity helping the homeless. GH had initiated a similar prank two years earlier, when Tronville University had won the cup. GH was known to be charitable and a good sport, more interested in success on the field than in receiving the payment, and keen to have the cup back for display at UNO's victory celebration to be held three days later.
<p>
<dd>AB, CD and EF went to the Graduate Students' Residence, located the accommodation GH had been given, a detached chalet-style bedroom and bathroom in the Residence grounds, and knocked on the door. A voice inside asked who was there, and EF replied &quot;Complimentary room service&quot;. When the door was opened, AB, CD and EF pushed their way into the room. They found that they were in the wrong chalet. The occupant, a distinguished visiting professor, was outraged at the violation of privacy, and complained to the Master of the Students' Residence. The Master bypassed the campus police and complained to the provincial police.
<p>
<dd>AB, CD and EF have now been charged with the offense, contrary to section 349(1) of the Criminal Code, of entering a dwelling house without lawful excuse with intent to commit an indictable offense.
<p>
<dd>Describe how you would defend AB, CD and EF against conviction, and explain what legal principles support the arguments you would make.
<blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> You have not been given the language of the indictment, and should not raise procedural matters such as the indictment being void for vagueness.

<p><br>
54 Minutes <b>Question 1:</b> Answer all 6 questions (5 marks for each part) for 30% of marks.
<p>
(a) Your client is charged with threatening death (or uttering death threats as it is sometimes called). What modes of
trial are available?
<p>
(b) The police arrest your client for assault. The complainant is his wife. There is some evidence that violence has
been escalating in the relationship and the wife fears for her life. What should the police do?
<p>
(c) Parliament proposes enacting a provision whereby the police may surreptitiously install very small radio transmitters (known as &quot;tracking devices&quot;) on any person's clothing, possessions or motor vehicle in order to follow them more easily during criminal investigations. A warrant lasting 60 days must be obtained from a judge on the basis of &quot;reasonable grounds to suspect&quot; that an offense has been committed and that
&quot;information relevant to the offense can be obtained&quot; from the tracking device. These devices cannot intercept conversations. They simply reveal a person's whereabouts and facilitate surveillance. What advice would you give Parliament about this provision?
<p>
(d) If the accused is charged with manslaughter can the judge at the preliminary inquiry commit the accused
for trial on murder? If the evidence is circumstantial, how should the judge apply the test for committal?
<p>
(e) What must the police say or do to effect a lawful arrest? What must the police say or do to effect a lawful entry to search premises?
<p>
(f) Your client, who is now 85 years old and lives in Thunder Bay with an extended family of equally elderly brothers and sisters, is charged in Kingston with sexually assaulting his son and his daughter in that city 35 years ago. His defense is a denial but his wife, who is now dead, is not available to testify in support of his defense. Furthermore, his elderly brothers and sisters, who can also support his defense, are too sick and frail to travel to Kingston. What remedies are available to the defence?
<p><br>
36 Minutes <b>Question 2:</b> Answer both questions (10 marks each) for 20% of marks
<p>
(a) The police in Kirkland Lake received an anonymous &quot;Crime Stoppers&quot; tip that two persons who had just tried to sell cocaine in a bar had left in a white 1988 Oldsmobile heading south to Sudbury. The driver was described as male with long curly hair and the passenger was described as female. The tip was dispatched and an O.P.P. cruiser on Highway 11 quickly spotted a southbound white Oldsmobile with 2 occupants. He pulled the car over with his flashing roof lights and noted that the driver and the passenger fitted the descriptions. Officer Fisherman advised the driver that he had just received a complaint about drugs and that he would like to clear it up by searching the car and then they could proceed on their way. The driver said &quot;sure&quot; and let Officer Fisherman search the car. The officer immediately found a loaded handgun under the driver's seat and charged the driver with possession of a restricted weapon. What issues should the defense raise at trial and how are they likely to be resolved?
<p>
(b) Your client is charged with manslaughter. The alleged offense was the result of a bar room brawl. There is some evidence of self-defence as a number of the patrons in the bar who are friends of the accused will testify that the deceased came after your client with a broken beer glass, slashing at him, and your client responded with a number of blows to the head with a pool cue which killed the deceased. Your client has a lengthy criminal record for crimes of violence and is feared in the small town where the offence occurred. He has always lived in the town but has rarely held a job. He has no record for failing to appear. Many of the patrons in the bar have not yet been interviewed by the police and the Crown wishes a publication ban at the bail hearing so that none of the evidence will be published in a way that would influence those witnesses who might be afraid of the accused and who have not yet given a statement. The Crown would like to call one of the investigating officers to testify at the bail hearing about the accused and about the offense, mainly on the basis of hearsay derived from the investigation. The accused does not want a publication ban at the bail hearing and wishes to call witnesses to testify in support of his defense that the death was caused in self-defence. What are the provisions of the Criminal Code that govern your client's bail hearing, what procedural rulings will likely be made at the bail hearing and what is the likely result?
<p><br>
45 Minutes <b>Question 3:</b> 25% of marks.
<p>
The 22 year old accused was charged in Newmarket with 3 separate counts of sexual assault, involving 3 young children, on October 3, 1993. He was released on bail on strict conditions that he reside with his parents (who acted as surety on his bail), maintain an 8:00 p.m. curfew, report to the police twice a week and not be in the presence of children under 16. The accused was a lifeguard at a local swimming pool and the bail conditions meant that he had to leave his job. It took 3 months for the accused to retain counsel and for the Crown to make disclosure. By January 3, 1994 the parties were ready to set a date for trial. The Crown elected to proceed by indictment and sought an early date so the 3 young boys could testify as soon as possible. The court advised counsel that its lists were heavily booked for the next year and offered January 12, 1995 as the earliest available date for a preliminary inquiry. The court invited counsel to speak to the trial coordinator so that if an earlier date became available, due to other trials being cancelled or adjourned, the case could be brought forward to the earlier date defence counsel advised the court that the January, 1995 date was satisfactory as the accused wished to return to university for the next 3 semesters in order to re-train for a new line of work.
<p>
On January 12, 1995 the preliminary inquiry commenced with two of the young boys testifying for the Crown but there was insufficient time to complete the evidence of the third boy. The next date available for continuation of the preliminary inquiry was June 12, 1995 and the accused was remanded to that date.
<p>
In May, 1995 the Crown provided some additional disclosure to the defense which had just come to light. The new evidence was some school records relating to the first boy, who had already testified, indicating that he had made a false accusation of sexual assault against a school teacher on a prior occasion. The accused's counsel immediately brought an adjournment application in order to further investigate the new disclosure material. He also sought an order requiring the first boy to re-attend for further questioning concerning the newly disclosed material. The adjournment was granted but the judge refused to order the first boy to re-attend at the preliminary inquiry as he held that the newly disclosed material related only to credibility. The next available date was December 12, 1995 and this was noted as the target date to be set when the information and the accused were back in court on June 12, 1995.
<p>
On June 12, 1995 the information was not in court and the case was not listed on the court docket as the court clerk had already filed it for the target date of December 12, 1995. The accused and his counsel sat quietly in the body of the court and when the case was not called or spoken to in any manner they left the court room.
<p>
On December 12, 1995 both the accused and the information are back in court on the docket for continuation of the preliminary inquiry. What should the Crown do? What should the defense do?
<p><br>
45 Minutes <b>Question 4:</b> 25% marks
<p>
There have been 3 serious armoured car robberies in Toronto in the month of September, all involving Brinks' trucks delivering money to bank teller machines. The perpetrator always seems to know the exact time and place of the truck's arrival and takes the guard delivering the money by surprise overpowering him from behind and then escaping in a waiting car. The guards in the 3 robberies all describe their assailant as a man with brown curly hair, tattoos on both arms, and driving a brown North American car with pink dice that dangle from the rear view mirror. The police investigation leads them to suspect that Johnny Rounder is the culprit as he has a lengthy criminal record for robbery, he fits the description given by the 3 guards, he drives a car that fits the description given by the 3 guards, he had just been paroled to Toronto in August when the robberies began in September and he has been known in the past to have contacts inside Brinks who could have informed him of the trucks' delivery schedules. The police conduct a photo line-up, with the 3 guards viewing an array of photos that includes Jimmy's latest mug shot. None of them identifies Jimmy as their assailant and, indeed, one of them remarks that Jimmy's nose is much longer and straighter than the robber's.
<p>
Nevertheless, the police are convinced that Jimmy is the culprit and they obtain a search warrant permitting them to search Jimmy's home for "any and all evidence" relating to the 3 robberies. The information in support of the search warrant is sworn by a junior officer, Constable Mark, who is not familiar with all the facts of the investigation. He sets out all the information known to the police, as recited above, except for the failed photo line-up, which he was not aware of. The police are unable to find the money from the robberies during the search of Jimmy's home but they seize his address book and his clothes. Further investigation of these two items leads to the discovery of the name of a Brinks' employee in Jimmy's address book and forensic testing of Jimmy's gloves produces traces of fibres consistent with Brinks' canvas money bags. The police arrest Jimmy at the local pool hall where he habitually hangs out. They search his car, which is parked two blocks away, and find some of the Brinks' money hidden in the spare tire in the trunk. Jimmy is charged in a single count in an information that alleges he:
<blockquote>
&quot;did steal the property of Brinks by using violence against three of its guards at Toronto on September 4, 16, and 22nd&quot;.
</blockquote>
Jimmy retains you once again as his lawyer and instructs you that he is innocent of the robberies and wishes to call an alibi defense in relation to two of the three dates when the robberies occurred and when he knows exactly where he was. He is unsure of his whereabouts on the third date.
<p>
What issues will you raise at trial in Jimmy's defense? If Jimmy calls alibi evidence in his defense can the Crown then produce Fred Trusty to testify that he is the Brinks' employee who gave Jimmy the information about the trucks' delivery schedules? The police have been using Fred as an informant, since discovering his name in Jimmy's address book, and had not told the Crown about him. The police had hoped to protect Fred's cover so they could continue to use his underworld contacts to solve other crimes. But once Jimmy testifies to an alibi the police feel they must use Fred's evidence now to insure Jimmy is convicted and they disclose it to the Crown

<b>1)</b> The Morelawn Lawnmower Company sells a mower which is particularly effective at cutting grass. Because of its excellent performance, the mower sells for $500, which is $100 more than alternative mowers. The mower does not cost any more than other mowers to produce. Unfortunately, users have begun to experience problems with the mower. In 1 out of 100 mowers, the blade flies off the mower and severely injures a bystander. The typical injured bystander suffers losses of $14,000. Ordinary lawnmowers do not have this problem, but they do not cut grass as well. Morelawn could correct the problem by redesigning the mower, but the new mower would
cost $550, and no one will pay more than $500 for a lawnmower.
<blockquote>
a) Sam has suffered a $14,000 loss because of Jane's lawn mower. Under a contributory negligence liability system, whom should he sue, and what is the outcome?
<p>
b) If manufacturer's are strictly liable for losses caused by their products, what is the outcome?
<p>
c) How does your answer in b) change if the losses are suffered by Jane, not Sam.
<p>
d) How does your answer in b) change if the losses are suffered by Jane, and the losses are $9,000?
<p>
e) Describe the no fault approach to lawnmower safety, assuming that the losses are suffered by lawnmower owners. Compare the no fault approach with strict liability of manufacturers.
</blockquote>
<p><br>
<b>2.</b> Essex Wire built a plant next door to Alcoa Aluminum's plant in Indiana. Alcoa and Essex had a contract which specified that Alcoa would sell molten aluminum to Essex. Essex would make aluminum wire from the molten aluminum. The Essex plant was expected to generate $10 million per year in profits because of the lower cost of making wire from molten aluminum Alcoa expected to make $5 million in profits per year from the contract.
<blockquote>
a) Why would Essex want a contract before building the plant next to Alcoa's plant?
</blockquote>
During the energy crisis in the 1970's the price of electricity increased so much that Alcoa was losing $11 million per year on the contract. Alcoa refused to supply any more aluminum and Essex sued.
<blockquote>
b) What arguments would be made by each side in this legal case? Evaluate these arguments from an economic point of view.
<p>
c) If the court decides to enforce the contract, what damages are appropriate?
<p>
d) How would the outcome differ in c) if the court decided to use specific performance rather than damages.

<b>3)</b> Mary, age 10, is an orphan as a result of the death of her parents in an automobile accident caused by David. Mary's parents were each earning $50,000 per year. She was adopted by her aunt and uncle who had no other children. They each earn $60,000 per year. How will an Ontario court calculate damages in this case? What level of damages would lead to economic efficiency?
<p><br>
<b>4)</b> Diane has rented a car for a twenty week period under an agreement in which she would own the car at the end of the rental period. The payments were specified to be $500 per week for 20 weeks. At the end of the twenty week period the car would have a value of $6000. The agreement contained a clause that said that the car could be repossessed if a payment were missed, and that the agreement would be terminated upon repossession.
Diane forgot to make the last weekly payment on the car and it was repossessed.
<blockquote>
a) Describe Diane's legal position.
<p>
b) Analyze the case and the relevant legal doctrines from an economic of point 
</blockquote>
<p><br>
<b>5.</b> In Lewvest Limited v Scotia Towers Limited the defendant (Scotia), a contractor, was constructing a building adjacent to the plaintiff's property. In the course of construction, the boom of a sky crane swung out over the property of the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought an injunction to prevent this practice.
<p>
The court noted that the extra cost of building without crossing the plaintiff's land is $400,000. Assume that the inconvenience to the plaintiff is valued at $50,000.
<blockquote>
a) The court in this case issued an injunction against Scotia Towers. Is this result efficient? Should the court have chosen another outcome?
<p>
b) How would the court's decision be affected if the court did not know the cost imposed on Lewvest?
<p>
c) If Scotia flew over the land of Lewvest in an airplane, would the court have ruled the same way? Compare the two situations from an economic point of view.

<p><br>
<dd>NRG Company is the owner of Flavelle Hydro (a private operation). The company has a large workforce of both unionized and non-unionized staff. Most employees are represented by the Hydro Workers Union, although there is a separate unit of non-unionized clerical workers and a unit of professional employees represented by the Society of Engineers.
<p>
<dd>There have been a number of workplace incidents in recent months arising from employee use of alcohol and drugs. The most recent involved Tom O'Leary, a line installer. His duties included the installation of overhead electric power lines as well as installation of lines in underground vaults and attachment of lines to homes and other buildings. While working high above the ground in a &quot;cherry picker&quot; type of lift during an overhead line installation, he lost his balance and almost fell to the ground. The operator of the lift was able to get him down safely. Subsequent investigation revealed that Tom was under the influence of alcohol. When his supervisor threatened to recommend discharge, Tom confessed that he was addicted to alcohol, but that he would be willing to undergo treatment if only he could keep his job.
<p>
<dd>Note that Tom has worked for the company for three years. He is in a bargaining unit represented by the Hydro Employees Union.
<p>
<dd>At the moment, Tom is suspended without pay. The Vice-President of Human Resources has come to you for legal advice about a number of issues resulting from this and other incidents involving other employees:
<p>
a) The company's preference is to discharge Tom on the basis that he is a safety risk who endangered himself and other workers during the incident in question and who is likely to be a continuing risk because of his alcoholism. If discharge occurs, what is the likely liability of the company if he brings a complaint to the Ontario Human Rights Commission? Discuss his lines of argument, their likelihood of success and remedial issues. (Assume that the union will not arbitrate any grievance he might have under the collective agreement.)
<p>
b) The company is very concerned about performance problems associated with drug and alcohol use. Instead of discharging Tom, could the company require him to undergo random testing (urine tests or breathalysers) for a period of two years as a condition of keeping his job? If the tests show that he has consumed any alcohol or uses drugs such as cocaine, he will be discharged automatically.
<p>
c) The company might consider, as an alternative to random testing, that Tom be reinstated to a position that is not safety sensitive. Unfortunately, there are only two job classifications in the bargaining unit which fit this requirement - stores clerk and dispatcher. Under the collective agreement, all job openings must be posted and awarded to the most senior employee who applies. Since these two jobs are highly sought after, it is unlikely that Tom has enough seniority to bid for them, and the company wants to know if the seniority rules remain effective in this situation to prevent his reassignment.
<p>
d) Since the incident referred to above, a further matter has come to light. Kate Tyler, who worked on a crew with Tom over the last year, told the team leader that she hoped Tom would not be reinstated - or at least, not in the same work area. Apparently, he had made a series of remarks during their working relationship about her attractive physical appearance and his inability to understand how such a good looking woman could be a lesbian. She tried to laugh the comments off, but they bothered her a great deal. As she put it, &quot;I don't like to make trouble, but I want this to stop&quot;. Should the company be concerned about possible liability under the <cite>Human Rights Code</cite> because of harassment by Tom?
<p>
[In answering the series of questions above, one third of your time should be spent on part (d) and two thirds on the first three parts. Since the first three parts overlap significantly, I have not allocated specific marks to each in order to give you some flexibility in organizing your answer. I will mark them as a unit.]

NOTE: While you are encouraged to read all four questions before beginning your answer, do not rely on the additional facts presented in later questions when answering earlier questions.
<p>
You may assume, for the purposes of this examination, that to prove a charge of possession of property obtained by theft, the Crown has to establish the following elements: (i) the property was obtained by theft; (ii) the accused was in possession of the property; and (iii) the accused knew the property had been obtained by theft.
<p>
<h4>Facts</h4>
The following facts were available to both the Crown and the defense before the start of the trials mentioned below.
<p>
Quark and Rom are brothers who jointly own and operate a secondhand clothing store in downtown Enterprise in the Canadian province of Flavelle. They live upstairs in a two-bedroom apartment. Quark and Rom share kitchen, washroom, and living room, and though each bedroom has its own lock, the brothers trust each other and rarely lock their doors.
<p>
On 1 August 1995, P.C. O'Brien of the Enterprise Police received a phone call from Garak, owner of a fashionable men's wear shop. Garak said that the previous evening, someone had taken one thousand silk paisley ties from a delivery bay outside his shop. There was little to indicate who had committed the theft, but someone had dropped a brown leather glove at the scene. Garak was extremely distressed about the theft and urged O'Brien to investigate it as quickly as possible.
<p>
Following this report, the Chief Inspector of the Enterprise Police sent P.C. Dax, an undercover officer, to look around second-hand clothing stores in downtown Enterprise. Dax went into Quark and Rom's store. Rom was working alone at the time. Dax asked him, &quot;Have you got any new ties in stock?&quot; Rom replied, &quot;No, no, nothing at all.&quot; It seemed to Dax that this answer betrayed some nervousness, and, seeking a small sealed box behind the counter, she asked Rom, &quot;What's in the box?&quot; Rom replied, &quot;Oh, nothing, nothing at all; it's just an empty box.&quot; Dax then identified herself as a police officer and said, &quot;Now will you tell me what is in the box?&quot; Rom handed the box to Dax, who opened it and discovered 50 silk paisley ties. On her way back to the station, Dax happened to run into Garak, who exclaimed, &quot;Oh wow! Good work! Those are my ties all right.&quot; Dax asked him how he could be so sure, and Garak replied, &quot;I purchased the ties from a foreign manufacturer, but I sewed my own logo directly into the material of each one. Can you see it?&quot;
Dax then obtained a valid search warrant, and returned to search Quark and Rom's shop and apartment. Another 950 ties were discovered in Rom's bedroom.
<p>
Rom was arrested, was charged with possession of property obtained by theft, and was properly cautioned and advised of his right to counsel. After consulting with duty counsel over the phone, Rom gave the following statement to Dax and her colleague P.C. Odo.
<dl>
<dt>Rom:
<dd>On 29 July at about 11:00 p.m., I had just come home from the Enterprise Odeon. True Lies was playing. Our old friend Morn came in with a big box and a small box. Quark spoke to him for some time, and I saw Quark give him some cash. Quark then asked me if I would keep the box in my bedroom, and I said I would.
<p>
<dt>Dax:
<dd>Did you ever see what was in the boxes?
<p>
<dt>Rom:
<dd>No. I didn't know anything until you opened the small box in front of me.
<p>
<dt>Dax:
<dd>Why did you seem so nervous when I came into the shop?
<p>
<dt>Rom:
<dd>You looked like a cop. Quark has been in trouble before, and I was afraid he might be again.
</dl>
Dax and Odo then contacted Morn. Before taking his statement, they said to him, &quot;You must tell us the truth, because if you don't you will be in big trouble.&quot; Morn admitted that he stolen the ties from outside Garak's shop and had brought them to Quark and Rom's shop. He said that in the meeting mentioned by Rom, he had told Quark about the theft. He agreed to testify against Quark in exchange for Dax and Odo's agreement not to prosecute him for the theft. Dax and Odo each made separate transcripts of Morn's statement. and these transcripts agree in every detail.
<p>
Dax and Odo then returned to the shop and arrested Quark for possession of stolen property. He was properly cautioned. When advised of his right to counsel, he said, &quot;I need to talk to Sisko right away.&quot; Dax allowed Quark to call Sisko but Sisko was unavailable. Quark was held overnight and in the morning attempted to contact Sisko again. He was informed that Sisko was away in Cardassia handling a murder trial that was expected to last another week. Dax said, &quot;Why don't you speak to duty counsel, or to another lawyer? We can give you a list of names.&quot; Quark said, &quot;No, Sisko is the best.&quot; Losing patience, Dax and Odo then questioned Quark about the ties. He gave the following statement:
<blockquote>
I don't know what you're talking about. I had no idea there were any ties on the premises. I never saw Morn on the 29th. That evening, I went to see Apollo 13 at the Enterprise Odeon. I not home at about 10:45 and went to bed. That's it.
</blockquote>
Dax and Odo then contacted Kira, the manager of the Enterprise Odeon. Kira confirmed that the theatre had only one screen and that <cite>Apollo 13</cite> was playing that evening.
<p>
Quark, though not Rom, has previously been involved in selling stolen property. In 1990, he was convicted of possession of property obtained by theft, and was given a suspended sentence. He has since been pardoned for this offense. In December 1994, Dax caught Quark in possession of raincoats owned by Bashir and stolen by Morn. Bashir is available to testify about this incident if necessary. Quark was again found guilty and was granted a conditional discharge. Sisko had acted for Quark in these cases and will be Quark's counsel on the current charge.
<p><br>
<b>Question 1.</b> (35 marks)
<p>
Quark has waived his preliminary inquiry and has elected trial by judge and jury. You are the judge. Rule on the following pretrial motions, outlining the positions of both parties and providing reasons and authority for your decisions.
<p>
(a) (15 marks)<br>
Quark has challenged the constitutional validity of s. 359(1) of the Criminal Code and asks that it be declared of no force and effect (this section appears on p. 609 of the materials; you may assume that the Crown has complied with the notice provision in s. 359(2)). The Crown seeks to uphold the section. Assume that you are deciding the question free from authority (that is, ignore any cases on point that may appear in your annotated Criminal Code). How do you rule?
<p>
(b) (20 marks)<br>
The Crown attorney has advised you that Garak has died. The Crown proposes to have Dax testify as to what Garak told her when she encountered him on her way back to the station. The defense objects to this line of questioning. How do you rule?
<p><br>
<b>Question 2.</b> (35 marks)
<p>
You are a member of Quark's defense team. Quark has decided to testify; he will admit knowing that Rom had ties in his bedroom, but will deny any knowledge of how they were obtained. Sisko has asked you to provide him with a memorandum considering any evidentiary issues that may be raised, other than those considered in Question 1, based on the facts presented so far. Write the memorandum, providing reasons and authority for your conclusions.
<p><br>
<b>Question 3.</b> (15 marks)
<p>
You are a law clerk for the judge at Quark's trial. Rom has testified that he himself stole the ties from Garak's shop, that he himself met with Morn to discuss how they should be disposed of, and that Quark was asleep during this conversation. Rom has testified further that he dropped the brown glove found at the scene during the theft; during his testimony, he has tried it on and it fits him perfectly. Morn's testimony is consistent with Rom's. Crown counsel has cross-examined both Rom and Morn on their earlier statements, but both witnesses have refused to adopt them. Crown counsel wants the judge to tell the jury that they can consider the earlier statements for their truth; defense counsel submits that the statements should go only to the witness's credibility. The judge has reserved her decision overnight and has asked you for a memorandum fully analyzing the parties' submissions and recommending a ruling. Write the memorandum.
<P><br>
<b>Question 4.</b> (15 marks)
<p>
You are an articling student in the Flavelle Crown Law Office. Rom is about to stand trial for possession of the stolen ties. Assume that he will testify in his own defense, and that his evidence will be consistent with the statement he originally gave to Dax and Odo. Your principal has asked you whether there is any way the Crown can use Rom's initial conversation with Dax, or Rom's testimony at Quark's trial and any evidence deriving from it, at Rom's trial. Prepare the memorandum, providing reasons and authority for your conclusions.

<p><br>
<b>1.</b> Sarah and David have been married for 27 years. They were married in June of 1968. At the time of the marriage David was working for a major automobile company. (He had started work when he was 18). He continued to work for the company throughout the marriage, and now, at the age of 52, holds an executive
position. At the time of the marriage Sarah, who is two years younger than David, had just completed a Masters Degree in history. During the first few years of the marriage she completed her doctorate, with financial support from David, combined with student loans and graduate teaching assistantships. After completing her graduate studies, she found a teaching position at a university. After many years of a successful academic career, she moved into university administration. Three years ago she was made President of the university, a position which she continues to hold. Sarah and David had no children. Sarah and David separated by mutual consent six
months ago, in June of 1995.
<p>
The parties have resided together in several homes. When David was 19 he inherited a house worth $18,000 from his grandmother, which was worth $25,000 at the date of marriage. The house is registered in his name alone. The parties moved into that house right after the wedding and lived there for eight years. When they moved into their second home, David rented out the first house. The rental income from the first house has always been deposited into a bank account in David's name. The account has accumulated rental income and interest and had a balance of $25,000 six months ago and $27,000 today. The first house was worth $100,000 six months ago. Unfortunately, last month David was notified that the house was built on property that has been found to be contaminated with toxic wastes. The tenants have moved out and the property is now worthless.
<p>
The parties' second home was purchased in joint tenancy and continues to be held that way today. At the date of separation, the parties were not living in the jointly owned home because as President of the university, Sarah was obliged to live in the President's residence on the campus. The jointly owned home was worth $350,000 when Sarah became President, $320,000 six months ago and $300,000 today. It had a mortgage of $150,000 when Sarah became President; $60,000 six months ago; and $58,000 today. When David moved out of the President's residence, he moved back into the jointly owned home and has now put it on the market for sale. He is making all mortgage and utility payments on the home. The President's residence in which Sarah lives was worth $500,000 both six months ago and today and has no mortgage.
<p>
When the parties moved into the President's residence, they put their furniture in storage. Six months ago the value of the furniture was $30,000. It is worth the same amount today. When David moved back into the jointly owned home, he took the furniture out of storage.
<p>
David has been purchasing shares in the auto company for which he works every year since he began employment. Today the shares are worth $75,000. Six months ago they were worth $70,000. At the time of the marriage, he owned shares worth $5,000.
<p>
When David and Sarah married each owned furniture worth $1,000, all of which has since been thrown out. David owed a car worth $3,000. Sarah had student loans of $6,000. She took out another $5,000 worth of student loans during her doctoral studies. The car was traded in after the marriage and the proceeds applied to the parties' first new car and the student loans were paid off years ago.
<p>
In addition to the bank account which contains the rental income from the first home, David has another account in his name. Six months ago it had a balance of $2,400 and today the balance is $1,800. The parties had a joint account that had $3,200 in it six months ago and is closed today. The parties split the money after separation and closed the account. Sarah also has her own bank account. Six months ago, the account had $1,000 in it. David says that within the last five months Sarah was awarded a prestigious prize, worth $25,000, for her contributions to academic life over the course of her career and the balance in the bank account is now $26,000.
<p>
In 1973, Sarah's grandfather died and left her a farm worth $75,000. Six months ago the farm was worth $250,000 and today it is worth $225,000. A farm manager looks after and lives on the property. David and Sarah visited the farm occasionally and had planned to move there after they retired. Sarah also inherited from her grandfather an antique desk, worth $6,000. The desk had always been kept in the room in their various homes designated as the study, and had been used by both of them. It was the one piece of furniture Sarah moved into the President's house. Six months ago its value was $15,000, and it has the same value today.
<p>
Two years ago David's mother died and left him $150,000. He used $75,000 of the money to pay down some of the mortgage on the jointly held home. In an effort to bolster their marriage, he used $25,000 for a two month world tour which he and Sarah took. He also bought Sarah $10,000 worth of jewelry, which he gave to her as a gift, and which she still has. Its value has not changed. He spent the balance of $40,000 to purchase an antique car. Six months ago the car was worth $50,000 and today it is worth $60,000.
<p>
Sarah's parents, who are still alive, own a cottage where David and Sarah spent a good portion of each summer during their marriage. It is understood within the family that Sarah, an only child, will inherit the cottage when her parents die. Over the years, David, who enjoys building and carpentry, has spent a fair amount of his time and labour improving and renovating the cottage, and he and Sarah have expended approximately $20,000 of their joint funds to pay for some of the improvements. The cottage, which was worth $25,000 when they were married, is now worth $200.000 (which was also its worth six months ago).
<p>
Both parties have credit card debts. Six months ago David owed $4,500, $2,500 of which was for corporate expenses for which he can be reimbursed. Today he owes $2,000 of personal expenses. Sarah owed $2,600 on her credit card six months ago and $1,800 today.
<p>
David and Sarah want to negotiate a separation agreement to deal with their property claims under the <cite>Family Law Act</cite>. (Spousal support is not an issue.) David has come to seek your advice. Please prepare an opinion for David explaining how the NFP calculation would be done on the facts as they have been presented above. Please provide a written commentary in addition to your numerical calculations so that David will be able to understand how each asset is being dealt with under the Act. If you feel you do not have sufficient information, feel free to make assumptions so long as you indicate you are doing so.
<p><br>
<b>2.</b> Please choose <b>ONE</b> of the following three questions:
<p>
(a) This question asks you to write a judgment in a case involving a claim for spousal support. Mr. and Mrs. Butler were married in 1984. There were no children of their marriage, although Mrs. Butler has a daughter born in 1975. Mrs. Butler had no continuing relationship with the child's father and he has played no role in their lives. Mrs. Butler is now aged 43. She completed high school with a Grade 12 diploma in June 1969. Prior to the birth of her daughter she was employed in a series of clerical positions and also worked part-time as a waitress. After the birth of her daughter, until her marriage in 1984, Mrs. Butler received Mother's Allowance benefits which she supplemented with income she earned from babysitting. During the marriage she did not work outside the home but continued to earn approximately $75-$100 per week from babysitting. Mrs. Butler suffered from longstanding health problems including recurring migraine headaches, shoulder pain, and back pain. Prior to their marriage, Mr. Butler was aware that Mrs. Butler had some health problems. Mr. Butler, an elementary school teacher, is 48 years of age. His current annual salary is $63,319.
<p>
The marriage was not a happy one. Problems arose early on, and late in 1986 the parties sought the assistance of the first of a series of marriage counsellors. By April of 1990 there was little communication between the parties; they participated in almost no activities together; and sexual relations had ceased. In May of 1991 they separated and Mrs. Butler commenced proceedings for divorce under the <cite>Divorce Act 1985</cite>. Since the separation Mr. Butler has paid interim spousal support of $400 per week. The parties have settled their property claims under Part I of the <cite>Family Law Act</cite> in a separation agreement. Mrs. Butler will receive $47,000 as her share of the net proceeds of the matrimonial home (which was purchased entirely with the husband's funds) and another $30,000 in respect of Mr. Butler's pension. In 1993 Mrs. Butler was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. She is not employable and, as the disease progresses, she will likely become more incapacitated in the future.
<p>
The divorce proceedings are now being heard. Mrs. Butler's lawyer has asked for permanent spousal support pursuant to s. l5 of the <cite>Divorce Act</cite>, while Mr. Butler's lawyer has argued that no spousal support should be awarded. You are the judge hearing the case. Write your judgment on the spousal support issue. In your judgment you are expected to canvass the legal issues raised by this set of facts and the relevant case law. (Assume that there is no issue of child support. Mrs. Butler's daughter, who continues to reside with her, is now twenty years old and employed, earning a modest income.)
<p>
(b) Rejecting recent proposals now dominant in American law reform circles to restructure spousal support around the economic principle of compensation for lost opportunities, several American academics have instead lent their support to what they term an &quot;income-sharing&quot; regime of spousal support, under which divorcing spouses would continue to share their joint incomes equally for a set numbers of years after divorce. Some proposals are for one year of sharing for every two years of marriage; some for one year of sharing for every year of marriage. Discuss these proposals, drawing on the cases and materials you have studied in the course. Would such an &quot;income-sharing&quot; regime be preferable to the current regime governing spousal support in Canada? Should the federal government draft spousal support guidelines based on these proposals? (This question will require an assessment of the current state of the law in Canada, as well as of the implications of the proposed regime.)
<p>
(c) You have been asked by the editors of the <cite>Canadian Bar Review</cite> to write a case comment on the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of <cite>L.G. v. G.B.</cite> (casebook, page 785). In your case comment you should discuss, amongst other issues, the state of the law prior to the decision; the possible impact of the decision on the area of law it deals with; and whether the directions suggested by the decision constitute a desirable development in the law.
<p><br>
<b>3.</b> Choose <b>ONE</b> of the following five questions.
<p>
(a) In a recent article on family law Professor Carol Weisbrod has argued that &quot;...the expressive or symbolic aspects of law should be used in the field of family law to guide people to better behaviour.&quot; Discuss, drawing on the materials examined during the course. Do you agree that family law should serve this role? To what extent does current Canadian family law, as you have studied it in the course, reflect this understanding of the role of law? What are the symbolic messages currently sent out by family law? Should they be changed?
<p>
(b) Has the &quot;no-fault&quot; revolution in family law been a mistake, as some of the readings in the course have suggested? Should the law continue to make rulings on &quot;fault&quot; and condition family law relief accordingly? Are we deluding ourselves into thinking that &quot;fault&quot; has disappeared? Comment, drawing on cases and materials discussed in the course.
<p>
(c) Sociological studies reveal the diversity of family forms in Canada today. Has modern family law, to the extent that you have encountered it in the course, been appropriately responsive to that diversity? To what extent does family law still suffer from the &quot;monolithic bias&quot; described by sociologist Margrit Eichler as &quot;a tendency to treat the family as a monolithic structure with an emphasis on uniformity of experience and universality of structure and functions rather than on diversity of experiences, structures and functions&quot;?
<p>
(d) Carol Smart argued, when writing about family law in Britain in 1982, that although the law was no longer oppressive of women in a simple and direct fashion and no longer condoned the &quot;grossest abuses of patriarchal power&quot;, it still legitimated patriarchy in less direct and obvious ways. Could the same be said of family law in Canada today?
<p>
(e) Professor Barbara Bennett Woodhouse, writing of American law, has criticized modern family law's vision of marriage as an expression of values of independence and individualism rather than as a commitment to co-operation and interdependence. She urges a revitalization of family law based on rewarding nurturing, commitment and solidarity, and on sustaining friendly environments for children's growth:
<blockquote>
&quot;I would suggest that any proposed standard be based in care giving and be strongly child-centered: the goal against which to measure family laws should be whether they promote the family's contemporary purpose of insuring a stable base for the growth of children and the mutual support of adults. Laws should encourage and reward family-centric, cooperative, nurturing behaviour. Three things draw me to this choice: first, it seems morally right; second, it seems pragmatically sound; and third, it respects the notion of liberty as freedom coupled with responsibility enshrined by John Stuart Mill.&quot;
</blockquote>
Discuss. Do you agree with Woodhouse's proposed standard for revitalization of family law? Do you see any problems with it? To what extent does Canadian family law, as you have studied it in the course, fall short of that standard and, if it does, what implications would the adoption of such a standard have on the future development of family law in Canada?

<center><h3>PART I</h3></center>
<b>NOTE: All students are required to answer Part I.</b>
<p>
Answer only <b>one</b> of the following two questions:
<p>
<b>1.</b> An Aboriginal Affairs Task Force established by the Reform Party of Canada issued a Report
on September 15, 1995. In its Report, the Task Force stated:
<blockquote>
&quot;We believe government, through a democratic process, should assist Aboriginal people to take responsibility for the programs affecting them, and encourage economic selfsufficiency. We believe in the equality of citizens of Canada and say that policies relating to Aboriginal persons should respect that principle.&quot;
</blockquote>
The Task Force recommended that the following policy statements form Reform Party policy:
<blockquote>
&quot;(a) Indian treaties will be fully honoured according to their original intent and in keeping with Court interpretation;
<p>
(b) Indian and Inuit affairs will continue to be administered by the federal government, and M&eacute;tis and non-status Indian affairs will remain the jurisdiction of provincial governments;
<p>
(c) Indian self-government will be a delegated form of government and not a recognition of inherent Aboriginal sovereignty;
<blockquote>
(i) all lands within the borders of Canada will remain part of Canada;
<p>
(ii) any form of self-government must uphold the principles of democracy and accountability (i.e., the freedom to organize politically, free and open election processes, opposition parties);
<p>
(iii) the laws of Canada (and the Provinces and Territories), including the Canadian Constitution and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, will apply;
<p>
(iv) any laws enacted by Indian self-government must conform with the laws of Canada.
</blockquote>
(d) Land claim agreements and self-government agreements will be negotiated under the principle of equality for and among all persons;
<blockquote>
(i) settlement of land claims will be negotiated publicly. All settlements will outline specific terms, be final, and conclude within a specific time frame:
<p>
(ii) final settlements will be affordable to Canada and the Provinces;
</blockquote>
(e) Individuals residing on settlement lands will have the freedom to opt for private ownership of their entitlements.
<p>
(f) Property owners forced to defend their property rights as a result of Aboriginal land claims will be compensated for defence of the claim.
<p>
(g) Individuals may decide whether they wish to contribute financially to Indian political organizations such as the Assembly of First Nations. This will replace direct funding of these organizations.
<p>
(h) Individuals who live on reserves and who are eligible to receive benefits such as social assistance may receive those benefits either from the federal government or through Indian self-government.
<p>
(i) The Auditor General of Canada will have full authority to review the Indian management of federal funds.
<p>
(j) Complaints directed to Indian government about management of federal funds may be appealed to the Auditor General of Canada, who may recommend civil or criminal proceedings.
<p>
(k) The Chief Electoral Officer of Elections Canada will have the same authority to examine Indian election procedures as he/she would have in any other federal jurisdiction.
<p>
(l) Complaints directed to Indian government about election procedures may be appealed to the Chief Electoral Officer, who may recommend civil or criminal proceedings.
<p>
(m) As the economic climate within Indian-governed communities improves and money is transferred from senior governments to individuals, Indian governments will fund their operations by taxing the members of these communities.
<p>
(n) Since equality of all citizens is the ultimate goal, Indian persons and corporations will be subject to the same taxation provisions as other Canadians. As Indian economic conditions improve, the taxation exemption under s. 87 of the Indian Act [which exempts reserve lands and personal property of an Indian on a reserve from taxation], will be eliminated.
<p>
(o) The Indian Act of Canada will be repealed and replaced by legislation respecting the above principles.
<p>
(p)A new relationship with Aboriginal peoples shall begin with a convention of Indian representatives from across Canada (elected by Aboriginal people) who will meet with senior government leaders to discuss how to apply these principles.&quot;
</blockquote>
Please discuss these policy statements in light of what we have covered in the course. Do you agree with them? If so, why? If not, why not? You are not required to comment on every statement, but you should address at least three statements in your answer.
<p><br>
<b>2.</b> In <cite>Delgammukw v. British Columbia</cite>, Mr. Justice Lambert wrote a dissenting judgment in which he stated (at pp. 160-61 of vol. I of the casebook) that:
<blockquote>
&quot;I would declare that the present aboriginal rights of self-government and self-regulation of the Gitksan and Wet'suwet'en peoples, exercisable in relation to their aboriginal title, would include the specific rights claimed in this appeal by the plaintiffs in relation to aboriginal title, namely,
<blockquote>
(a) a right to harvest, manage and conserve the lands and their resources, having regard to:
<blockquote>
(i) the preservation and enhancement of the quality and productivity of the natural environment;
<p>
(ii) the immediate and long-term economic, social and cultural benefits that may accrue to the plaintiffs and their future generations; and
<p>
(iii) consultation and cooperation with ministries and agencies of the Crown and with the private sector who may be affected by the exercise of the plaintiffs' rights;
</blockquote>
(b) a right to maintain and develop their institutions for the regulation of their aboriginal title and for the harvesting, management and conservation of the lands and their resources:
</blockquote>
I would declare that the present Aboriginal rights of self-government and self-regulation of the Gitksan and Wet'suwet'en peoples, would include rights of self-government and self-regulation exercisable through their own institutions to preserve and enhance their social, political, cultural, linguistic and spiritual identity.&quot;
</blockquote>
Mr. Justice Lambert also held that the above-mentioned rights are recognized and affirmed by s. 35(1) of the <cite>Constitution Act, 1982</cite>. Do you agree with his definition of Aboriginal rights and his view that s. 35(1) recognizes and affirms Aboriginal rights of self-government? If so, why? If not, why not?
<p><br>
<center><h3>PART II</h3></center>
<b>Note: Only those students who have opted not to write an Essay are to answer Part II.</b>
<p>
Answer only <b>one</b> of the following two questions.
<p>
<b>1.</b> Will Kymlicka, in <cite>Liberalism, Community and Culture</cite> (1991) writes the following (at pp. 47-48 of vol. I of the casebook):
<blockquote>
&quot;... a liberal needs to know whether a request for special rights or resources is grounded in differential choices or unequal circumstances. Someone who cultivates a taste for expensive wine has no legitimate claim to a special public subsidy, since she is responsible for the costs of her choice. Someone who needs expensive medicine due to a natural disability has a legitimate claim to a special public subsidy, since she is not responsible for the costs of her disadvantageous circumstances....
<p>
We can legitimately ask that aboriginal people form their plans of life with a view to the costs imposed by others, as measured by the market.... If the land aboriginal people wish to be left undeveloped is valuable to others, then their desire is costly to others, and [one might argue that] it is only fair that they pay for this costly desire ....
<p>
However, we can defend aboriginal rights [to, among other things, secure and use the land they desire] as a response, not to shared choices, but to unequal circumstances. Unlike the dominant French or English cultures, the very existence of aboriginal cultural communities is vulnerable to the decisions of the non-aboriginal majority around them. They could be outbid or outvoted on resources crucial to the survival of their communities, a possibility that members of the majority cultures do not face. As a result, they have to spend their resources on securing the cultural membership which makes sense of their lives, something which non-aboriginal people get for free.... The rectification of this inequality is the basis for a liberal defence of aboriginal rights, and of minority rights in general.&quot;
</blockquote>
Please comment on Kymlicka's defence of Aboriginal rights in light of <cite>Norris v. Thomas</cite>, [1992] 2 C.N.L.R. 139, where the British Columbia Supreme Court held spirit dancing is not-a right recognized by s. 35(1) of the <cite>Constitution Act, 1982</cite>. Do you agree with Kymlicka? If so, why? If not, why not?
<p><br>
<b>2.</b> In <cite>Guerin v. The Queen</cite> (1984), 13 D.L.R. (4th) 321, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized a fiduciary relationship between the Crown and Aboriginal nations in Canada. Please comment on the Court's reasoning in <cite>Guerin</cite> in light of the various normative justifications for differential treatment on the basis of indigenous difference that we examined early on in the course.

<dd>In late 1992, Glen Fox invited his brother, Neil, and two other brothers, at his expense, to travel with him from Seattle to Russia to tour Russia during July, 1993. Ultimately, an uncle, Ed Hewitt learned of the trip and was added to the tour, again at Glen's expense.
<p>
<dd>The tour was arranged through Whitman County Travel Inc. of Colfax, Washington, and was to depart from Seattle, Washington on July 1, 1993. The tour cost was U.S. $3,250.00 per person. Glen paid to Whitman all of the travel costs in U.S. funds on behalf of everyone, including the cost of travel from British Columbia for Ed Hewitt and the cost of travel for the others from Calgary.
<p>
<dd>The tour package provided for refunds subject to certain cancellation fees to be retained by the tour promoter up to June 1, 1993. The package provided that, after that date, &quot;no refunds can be expected&quot;.
<p>
<dd>On April 1, 1993, Neil, through Harding Hall and Graburn Insurance Inc. of Calgary, purchased two policies of travel insurance with John Ingle Insurance, a division of Commercial Union Life Assurance Company of Canada, one in his name and one in the name of Glen. The premiums for this insurance in the amount of $478.10 were paid by Glen. Coverage was confirmed by John Ingle on April 30, 1993. These policies provided, among other things, for the recovery of certain losses sustained by an insured by reason of trip cancellation.
<p>
The trip cancellation policies contained the following provisions, among others:
<blockquote><ol>
<li>Trip Cancellation, Interruption and Delay
<p>
When expenses are incurred as a result of an emergency or death of you, a member of your extended family or a companion or business associate with whom you are travelling during the policy period, the company will pay for:
<blockquote>
(i) The non-refundable portion of your deposit paid in advance and irrecoverable from any other source if you must cancel an insured trip, up to a maximum of $500.00, or up to the amount purchased at the time of application, per policy period. The maximum payable under the family plan is $15,000.00
</blockquote>
<li>Emergency was defined as follows:
<p>
&quot;Emergency&quot; means an unexpected or unforeseeable sickness or injury which requires immediate non-discretionary medical attention, treatment or care.
<p>
<li>Sickness was defined as follows:
<p>
&quot;Sickness&quot; means illness or disease which results in emergency treatment or care during the policy period.
<p>
<li>Claims
<p>
Please complete the Claim Form when making a claim under this policy and include (i) an original medical certificate from the attending physician indicating the diagnosis, (ii) cancelled transportation tickets, (iii) receipts for all pre-paid deposits, and (iv) correspondence and the amount of reimbursement from your travel agent.
<p>
Important
<ul>
<li>claims must be reported within 30 days of occurrence.
<li>written proof of claim is required within 90 days of occurrence.
<li>claims cannot be considered unless the claim form is duly completed and signed by the claimant and the attending physician with all required documentation.
<li>all documentation must be supplied free of expense to the company.
</ul>
</ol></blockquote>
<dd>On April 24,1993, Glen purchased three return airline tickets from Calgary to Seattle for himself and each of his brothers.
<p>
<dd>On May 12, 1993, Neil became very ill, suffering nausea, chills, fever and general malaise receiving medical treatment on two occasions up to May 19 when he was admitted to hospital where he remained until discharged on May 31. He was suffering from an acute infectious illness, presumably viral in nature, almost like acute malaria, although the nature of the infectious organism was never determined. Neil was advised by his doctor, on or about June 11, 1993, that he would not be able to travel and he accordingly advised Whitman County Travel Inc. and John Ingle to that effect on June 12 and 16, 1993 respectively. He continued under medical treatment for his condition until the end of September when he was advised that he could again travel.
<p>
<dd>When Neil applied for the travel insurance through Harding Hall and Graburn, he completed a questionnaire in which he was asked whether he was under doctor's care. He left the question blank but, in his discussion with Harding Hall and Graburn, was asked whether he was under any permanent disability and said no. At the time, Neil had not been feeling very well and had spoken to a cousin, a doctor, by telephone. The cousin told Neil that it was probably nothing more than fatigue and that the trip to Russia would be a welcome break.
<p>
<dd>Although not asked about prior trip cancellations either in the questionnaire or in his discussion with Harding Hall and Graburn, Neil had in fact experienced some bad luck in vacations in the past, having had to cancel two such vacations in the past five years due to illness.
<p>
<dd>On June 24, 1993, Whitman County Travel Inc. confirmed to Neil, in writing, receipt of the U.S. $3,250.00 on his behalf for the tour, for submission to his insurer. This, along with the doctor's statement, his airline tickets to and from Seattle and a claim form authorizing release of all medical records to the insurer were forwarded to John Ingle on July 6, 1993.
<p>
<dd>On September 10, 1993, Commercial Union paid Neil the sum of Cdn. $326.02 for reimbursement of the cost of the airline ticket to and from Seattle for Neil. John Ingle thereafter learned in telephone discussions with Whitman County Travel Inc. that there had been one cancellation of the tour for which a $200.00 cancellation fee had been paid to the tour organizer in Washington D.C., although there was no information in its records as to who had cancelled. John Ingle also learned that Glen had paid for Neil's tour package, among others.
<p>
<dd>Suspecting that Neil's uncle had gone in his stead and that a possible fraud was being practised on the insurer, John Ingle delayed payment of the balance of the claim until further information was provided. Proof of payment of the tour package for each of Neil, Glen and the brothers as well as the uncle was then provided to Commercial Union. It then issued a cheque payable to Neil in the amount of $4,049.50 (U.S. $3,250.00) but held delivery. On October 18, 1993, Neil filed a written proof of claim. On November 2, 1993 by letter in writing addressed to Neil, John Ingle declined the balance of the claim advising that an appeal could only be made by production of certified copies of payments made to the travel agent and the provision of a sworn Affidavit that Neil had paid for his own trip and had not received a refund.
<p>
<dd>In the interim, on October 13, 1993, Glen received a refund cheque marked &quot;Refund for Neil Fox&quot; from Whitman County Travel Inc. in the amount of U.S. $1,501.00 (Cdn. $1,870.25), the covering letter to Glen stating:
<blockquote>
&quot;Per our telephone conversation, attached find the refund cheque in the amount of U.S. $1,501.00 for your brother Neil.&quot;
</blockquote>
<dd>Neil only learned of this refund at or about the time of the receipt of the letter from John Ingle of November 2, 1993. As a result of that letter, Neil made demand against Commercial Union for the full recovery of the cost of the tour package. Commercial Union disputed Neil's claim on a number of grounds. Commercial Union also argued that, if Neil was entitled to recovery, the amount should be limited to $2,179.25, the sum of Cdn. $1,870.25 having been recovered by Glen or his agent on his behalf, as a refund from Whitman County Travel Inc.
<p>
<dd>Neil then sought legal advice as to commencing an action against Commercial Union for recovery under the cancellation policy.
<p>
<dd>As counsel for Neil, please advise Neil as to the following:
<ol>

<h2>International Trade Regulation<br>
Take-Home Examination<br>
December 1995</h2></center>
<h3>INSTRUCTIONS:</h3>
The Faculty of Law take-home exam policy states, in part: &quot;It is expected that there will be consultation amongst students writing the same take home examination, although the answer or answers returned by the student must be organized and written by that student alone&quot;.
<p>
Students should pay particular attention to the need for a take home answer to be their own work. It must be &quot;organized and written by that student alone&quot;. Contravening this rule is an academic offence under the University's Code of Academic Conduct. You may refer to any materials you wish.
<p>
Your answer must be returned within 48 hours of pickup, either to the Records Office in person or by fax to (416) 978-7899 or (416) 323-9491. (However, if you are picking up the examination question by fax at the end of the day on Friday, you may return your answer at the beginning of business on Monday). If you are returning the answer by fax, please keep a copy of the activity report from your fax machine.
<p>
There is a limit of 14 double-spaced, typed pages. Both answers should be of approximately equal length (7 pages).
<p>
<hr>
<p><br>
Answer <b>any two</b> of the following three questions:
<ol>
<li>&quot;National Treatment is the core international trade principle that addresses the effects of domestic regulation on liberalized trade. Attempts to move beyond National Treatment towards harmonization of domestic regulation are likely to produce incoherence and further conflict in international trading relations.&quot; Discuss, drawing on at least two of the following three areas: services, intellectual property rights, product and process
standards.
<p>
<li>&quqot;Trade action against subsidies and dumping may be economically irrational but it helps preserve a political balance between the interests of trading partners in hard economic times. Alternative approaches, such as safeguards or emergency action, are unlikely to he effective in the real world.&quot; Discuss.
<p>
<li>&quot;Using trade sanctions as a last-ditch response to violations of labour rights and inadequate environmental standards of trading partners is a reasonable compromise of domestic sovereignty in an increasingly interdependent world.&quot; Discuss.

<h2>Introduction to Legal Theory<br>
December 1995<br>
Professor Nedelsky</h2></center>
<h3>NOTE:</h3>
<ol>
<li>This is a three hour open book exam. Students may bring with them any notes, books, or materials that they wish. Each student must answer 2 questions. In choosing which theorists to <b>FOCUS</b> on, <b>YOU MUST CHOOSE DIFFERENT THEORISTS FOR EACH QUESTION.</b> Each question is weighted equally.
<p>
<li>Before you begin, ensure that you have written your pseudonym, course name, and the number of the booklet on <b>each</b> examination booklet and the name of the instructor on the <b>first</b> booklet. If you request an additional booklet(s) during the examination, write the required information on the booklet at the time you receive it. No time will be permitted for this at the end of the examination.
<p>
<li>During the examination, only one student at a time is permitted to leave the examination room. No student may leave within fifteen minutes of the conclusion of the examination.<p>
<li>At the end of this examination, the invigilator will ask you to stop writing, count the total number of booklets used, record this on the front of the first booklet, and insert all booklets into the first booklet. You will then gather your belongings and leave the examination room. <b>All examination answer booklets are to be left on the writing table and will be collected by the invigilator.</b><p>
<li>Time limits will be strictly enforced. Students who continue to write after the examination has ended will have their answer booklets collected separately and may be subject to a penalty.
</ol>
<hr>
<p><br>
1. What difference do conceptions of the self or agency make for law? Focus on 2 or 3 authors, referring to one or two others by way of support, contrast or example.
<p>
2. In different ways, Peller, MacKinnon, Finley and Williams all focus on law and language as contingent social creations. Explain how we can understand the nature of law and its potential and limitations as an agent of change (or of security or liberty) better by using their perspectives. What problems arise from adopting these perspectives and what are the potential solutions to them? (If you think the problems cannot be overcome, you may use this question to focus on the problems and use a contrasting author, such as Dworkin, to defend an alternative.) If you wish, you may use Taylor and/or Williams to focus on the importance of narrative or storytelling in the understanding and practice of law.
<p>
3. Discuss Dworkin's distinction between principle and policy and the role they play in his understanding of what a judge should do. Use two or three of the authors listed at the end of this question to critically engage with Dworkin's argument, and to reflect on what, if any, ways we should distinguish &quot;law&quot; from &quot;politics.&quot; Is there anything that should distinctively characterize "law"? Peller MacKinnon, Scales, Crenshaw and Williams.
<p>
4. What is Crenshaw's defence of the usefulness of rights? Does she tacitly accept a Dworkinian understanding of rights? What are the similarities and differences between their understandings (recognizing that Crenshaw is not spelling out a full theory of rights)? Use 2 of the following to further explore the strengths and weaknesses of invoking legal rights to achieve equality: MacKinnon, Peller, Taylor, Scales.
<p>
5. A great deal of feminist theory urges us to make &quot;difference&quot; central. Scales tells us to seek a legal system that &quot;works and at the same time makes differences a cause for celebration, not classification&quot; (p. 1376, 141 of casebook). How should we approach this issue? What would it mean to make difference central to law? What are the problems, what are the advantages? use three of the following: Benhabib, Spellman, Crenshaw, Gilligan, MacKinnon, Scales, Hoagland, Nedelsky.
<p>
6. There are many variants of the critique of universalistic conceptions of rights and of the replies that, however, useful the particularistic, context focused alternatives, we cannot do without some universal claims. Discuss three of the following: Scales, Benhabib, Tronto, Nedelsky and Taylor, or focus on two of them and contrast with Rawls.
<p>
7. Use Taylor, Galston, and Sandel (you may focus primarily on two of them) and Rawls to discuss the question of whether all theories of rights have a conception of the good underlying them. What difference does this issue make for our understanding of the nature of the law and its neutrality? Your essay may focus primarily on Taylor, Galston, Sandel and bring in Rawls only by way of counterpoint, or you may reverse the emphasis and focus on the defence of the priority of right. If you reverse the emphasis, you may also want to consider Dworkin.
<p>
8. Interpretation as an essential component of law is increasingly important in contemporary legal theory. Discuss the differences in the way 3 of the following theorists use argument about interpretation and the usefulness, strengths and weaknesses of each. Dworkin's &quot;Integrity in Law&quot;, Peller, Mackinnon, Crenshaw, and Williams.

<center><h3>QUESTION</h3></center>
<dd>On Monday, December 11, 1995 a number of events occurred in London, Ontario by way of a protest against the policies of the new provincial government. These events were preceded by a media campaign financed by various unions, community groups and other organizations. The objective of the exercise was to bring the City of London &quot;to a halt&quot; and to hold a large protest rally. On that day the following events transpired and require your analysis.
<ol>
<li>[<i>20 marks</i>] At Truro Manufacturing Ltd., an auto parts manufacturer, the Union representing the production staff is the Canadian Auto Workers (CAW). The CAW and Truro are in mid-collective agreement. The CAW had approached Truro prior to December 11 to attempt &quot;to negotiate&quot; a special day off without pay in order to facilitate the protest. While some other employers in the area have agreed to do this, Truro remained firm and refused to participate in such an ad hoc arrangement. Management at Truro has been influenced by the views of a popular local radio station talk show host (Vic Vacuo) who has been lambasting the day of protest as a &quot;socialist conspiracy&quot; and &quot;an illegal strike to boot&quot;. On the day in question a very large proportion of Truro's employees do not appear at work and do participate in the protest rally. <b>What is the legal situation on the l1th? Fully and critically analyze the position of Truro, the CAW and the workers. What if Truro and the CAW had agreed to a day off without pay? Vic Vacuo says this would still be an illegal strike. Is he right?</b>
<p>
<li>[<i>20 marks</i>] Another radio announcer, Bob Doe, at another local radio station had taken a somewhat different view of the December 11th events and fully supported the protest in part by taking the day off work and participating in the rally. Mr. Doe was fired as a result. <b>Please advise him.</b>
<p>
<li>[<i>20 marks</i>] Meanwhile, at Fundy Electrical Co. the employees are represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), and as is common in the construction industry their current collective agreement contains a &quot;closed shop&quot; provision which requires employees to retain union membership as a condition of continued employment. At a union meeting on November 30th, a very large majority of employees voted to support the day of protest on December 11th. This vote was taken after a fulsome debate in which Ernest Elves, a member of the union who is very much in favour of the Harris government policies, fully participated. On December 11th, Ernest Elves went to work (he was the only worker to do so) and he has subsequently been notified by letter from the Union that he has been expelled from Union membership and that the Employer, Fundy Electrical Co., has agreed that he will be terminated. <b>Fully advise Mr. Elves.</b>
<p>
<li>[<i>40 marks</i>] Still elsewhere in the City of London, the city employees are represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE). The collective agreement covering the workers is due to expire soon and the Union has been developing bargaining proposals for the upcoming negotiations. The City daycare workers, mostly women, are most anxious to participate fully and vocally in the day of protest because of their concerns about funding cuts for municipal daycare services. Other city workers in the unit are mainly &quot;outside&quot; workers and male. The &quot;outside&quot; workers are somewhat cool to the plight of their fellow daycare workers, partly because they in general have less seniority, but also because of a still outstanding pay equity claim by the daycare workers. On December 11th the daycare workers participate in the protest, but the other workers do not. The daycare workers are disciplined by the city by having written warning letters placed in their personal files. The daycare workers wish to file grievances, but the Union refuses to do so. The Union has also indicated that it has placed preservation of daycare as a low priority in its negotiating position. <b>Fully and critically analyze the situation in which the parties have found themselves.</b>

<ol>
<li>Draft recommendations to improve local government in the Toronto area with an explanation for the recommendations.
<p><br>
<li>&quot;A&quot; has a gravel pit at the edge of an urban development in the &quot;City above Toronto&quot;, Vaughan. She wishes to use the gravel pit site for a ready mix plant. The pit was depleted and extraction had ceased for approximately six months and she thus wishes to construct a ready mix plant and import aggregate from other gravel pits to use in the plant.
<p>
The site also contains a small abandoned five unit apartment building which had	housed employees who worked on the site many years ago. &quot;A&quot; intended to tear down the apartment building and build the readymix plant on the foundations of it.
<p>
The land including the apartment building was zoned &quot;Industrial Extractive&quot; which permitted gravel pits and accessory uses including readymix plants. However, it was designated in the City's new official plan, which had just been completed after five years of study, as future urban. That official plan stated &quot;when lands designated industrial extractive are no longer required for extractive uses, they shall be used for urban residential purposes&quot;.
<P>
&quot;A&quot; was unaware that the lands were in an area of demolition control. She tore down the apartment building and constructed the readymix plant without fist obtaining either a demolition permit or a building permit. Once the plant was up and operating, residents in a neighbouring subdivision complained of the dust emissions from the plant. As a result of their complaints, the Town Building Inspector came and told &quot;A&quot; she needed a building permit and that she should stop operating until she had one. &quot;A&quot; refused to stop her operation.
<p>
&quot;A&quot; however, prepared plans for submission for a building permit. Before she was able to make an application for the permit, the Town passed an Interim Control By-law without notice to &quot;A&quot; and zoned the land as &quot;Rural&quot; which prohibited all uses except agriculture.
<p>
The City also approved the undertaking of a new study which recommended that the lands be zoned for &quot;social housing&quot; in accordance with the provincial Policy Statement on affordable housing which provided that &quot;housing should be provided in all municipalities for a wide range of incomes&quot;. Since Vaughan had no affordable housing for low income groups, the City zoned these lands for &quot;low income families, ie. families with incomes below $50,000 per year&quot;. At the public meeting prior to the passing of the zoning by-law, the neighbouring residents turned out in force and were opposed to both, the zoning by-law and the readymix plant use. Whenever &quot;A&quot; attempted to speak, they shouted her down so she was unable to make any coherent comments to the City Council.
<p>
The City passed the zoning by-law, which also included &quot;A&quot;'s property in an area of site plan control. The standards with respect to site plan control included provisions that all open pits must have 24 hour surveillance because of the danger of someone falling into them and in addition, there was a requirement that the owner of open pits pay $1,000 per cubic metre of pit area towards a fund for the rehabilitation of such pits. The City has told &quot;A&quot; that she must pay the $1,000 per cubic metre fee and that there must be a guard for the pit until the site is redeveloped, and that the zoning bylaw had to be passed because there was no affordable housing in Vaughan.
<p>
&quot;A&quot; comes to your office. All she wants to do is to use her readymix plant without any conditions. What can she do? Advise her.

Alice Bell, who died in 1990, was a wealthy widow who lived in Toronto. Among other property, she owned a Forest Hills house and an island (Bell's Island) in cottage country. She had two sons, Christopher and David, both of whom are still alive. Christopher is married to Erica, has two children, and is a successful newspaper columnist well-known for his vivid advocacy of "family values" and right-wing economic views in the Toronto Moon. David is gay and a legal-aid lawyer, neither of which facts endeared him to his family. The principal provisions of Alice Bell's will, which took effect in 1990, read as follows:
<p>
1) I leave my house on Dunvegan Road, Toronto, to my son David, who cannot afford to buy his own house, although if he ever shares it with a gay lover he loses all his rights in it and it will go to my son Christopher.
<p>
2) I leave Bell's Island to my sons Christopher and David, as joint tenants and not as tenants in common.
<p>
David did not like clause 1 of the will, but was pleased enough to have a nice house to live in and moved in shortly after his mother's death. From 1992 he and Frank began a permanent relationship. Mindful of the clause in the will, David did not let Frank move in, although he spent almost every weekend in the Dunvegan Road house. In the summers David and Frank spent as much time as they could on Bell's Island, sharing the large cottage with Christopher and his family. About two years ago, however, the uneasy relations between the brothers became strained to the point that they stopped speaking to each other. Through Erica they agreed that Christopher would pay for the construction of a small cottage and dock on the island as far away from the main existing cottage as possible. He gave the new cottage to David, who thereafter paid the taxes on it and also paid for the various services for it. With Erica as go-between there were some negotiations between the brothers about partitioning the island, but they came to nothing. After the new cottage was built, and without any discussion of the matter, they kept to different sides of the island and never saw each other. Although David liked Christopher's children and wanted to see them, their father told them not to go over to David's &quot;side&quot;.
<p>
In September of this year Christopher was killed in a car accident, likely attributable to the cancellation of photo radar. David, who remembers fondly his property law course in law school, believed that as a result he owned Bell's Island outright. Last week, however, he received a letter from a lawyer acting for Erica which stated that she claimed a half-interest as Christopher's heir. David has consulted you for an opinion on this point. During the interview he also complained about not being able to co-habit with Frank. After reviewing the will you told him that the prohibition relating to the Dunvegan Road house might not be enforceable, which pleased him greatly. Indeed he wants you to devote a little more of your time to that question than to the question of ownership of the island. Please advise David. [Do not consider the possible effect of any matrimonial property law].

<dd>Bruce Guy is a Toronto lawyer who in his spare time invented and marketed herbal remedies which he hoped would replace regular drugs on the market. Some of the potions he invented were marketed commercially, but in very small quantities. However, after a number of experiments, he hit upon a combination of herbal remedies which, when combined together in pill form, could be used to induce sleep without any of the side effects associated with the drugs used for this purpose already on the market. Bruce entered into a very lucrative manufacturing and distribution contract for the pill with Blue Sky Remedies Company. Soon, the pill replaced most of the drugs used for this purpose previously on the market. The drug manufacturers were not happy. The Association of Drug Manufacturers lobbied the Federal Government to make a scientific study of Bruce's pill. The Association promised that its members would open new research facilities in Canada and hire more Canadian scientists if Bruce's pill was subjected to the same kinds of study as drugs ordinarily are in this country. This would mean that the pill would be off the market for at least five years. The Federal Government gave in to the pressure and ordered the Health Department to undertake the study. Using its powers in these circumstances, the Department forbade the sale of the pill while the study was ongoing. One of the tests undertaken by the Department showed that rats that were fed a steady diet of the pill in conjunction with beer for one month showed extreme disorientation. The Government then decided to ban the pill completely. Blue Sky Remedies brought an action against the Government for an injunction against the ban and damages.
<p>
<dd>Bruce is heartbroken over these events and dies. In his will he leaves whatever rights he has in relation to the pill to The University of Toronto.
<p>
<dd>In his will Bruce also left his house in Toronto to The University of Toronto &quot;on condition that it be used only for the education of law students who signed a declaration that they do not believe in God.&quot;
<p>
<dd>How would a court resolve the issues involved?

1. James has agreed to purchase Lana's home in Toronto. The purchase price is $200,000.00. The Agreement was signed on September 30, 1995. Closing is scheduled for December l 5, l 995.
<p>
<dd>James paid a deposit of $15,000.00 at the time that the Agreement was signed and the balance of the purchase price is payable on closing. The Agreement of Purchase and Sale contained a condition with regard to financing in the following form:
<blockquote>
&quot;This Agreement is conditional upon James being able to obtain financing for 80% of the purchase price at or below the prevailing interest rates.&quot;
</blockquote>
<dd>The Agreement of Purchase and Sale entered into between James and Lana was in the standard form used by the Toronto Real Estate Board and which was provided to you as a handout during this course. The Agreement was filled in by Colin, the real estate agent with whom Lana had listed the property. On the strength of the Agreement to sell to James, Lana has entered into another Agreement of Purchase and Sale whereby she will purchase another home property, with a closing date of December 15, 1995.
<p>
<dd>Lana has just finished meeting with you. During the course of her meeting with you, she has raised the following concerns:
<blockquote>
(a) Lana is aware that James agreed to purchase this property at a price which is somewhat above the market. For this reason, as well as because of the fact that she has agreed to buy other property, Lana is very anxious to have the sale to James completed. Lana is afraid, however that James would like to walk away from the sale.
<p>
(b) Nothing, as yet, has been said in any correspondence between James and Lana with regard to the condition on financing. Lana now regrets the very loose drafting of this clause in the Agreement of Purchase and Sale. Lana is willing, however, to take back a mortgage from James, if necessary, in the amount of 80% of the purchase price for
a one year term at an interest rate of 7%, which is the prevailing interest rate for one year mortgages, if this will help to make the transaction work
<p>
(c) Lana advises that one wall of the basement has a significant crack in it which has been getting wider recently. The wall is in the recreation room and is entirely covered with a decorative curtain which was installed before the crack appeared. Lana is not certain whether or not James noticed the crack. Lana did not, in any event, comment
upon it when James viewed the property.
<p>
(d) After the time for submitting requisitions pursuant to the Agreement of Purchase and Sale had passed, the City of Toronto registered a work order on December 11, 1995 against Lana's property because of deterioration in the front steps and railing of the house. Lana had received a deficiency notice from the City on October 2, 1995
regarding the steps and railing, but did not understand the importance of the notice and did nothing. Lana does not know whether she has an obligation to disclose the condition of the steps and railing to James and she is uncertain whether James' lawyer can raise the work order now that it has been filed by the City.
<p>
(e) Lana has recently learned that James and Colin are good friends. Colin is the one who introduced James to the property. That is why Colin is also shown on the Agreement of Purchase and Sale as the sales agent. Although Lana is happy with the above market price which James has agreed to pay, she has just learned that another prospective purchaser, Katy, spoke to Colin about this property a day or two prior to the submission by James of his Offer to Purchase and Lana has now learned that Katy would have paid $10,000.00 more for this home because it has unique attributes that are important to Katy. Since James' offer was the only offer presented to Lana, Lana was unaware that Katy had an interest in the property.
</blockquote>
<dd>Please advise Lana on her position with regard to James and Katy and the steps which Lana should take now, prior to closing, and after closing.
<p>
<b>QUESTION 1 IS WORTH 35 MARKS (48 minutes)</b>
<p><br>
2. Question two consists of two parts. The value of each part is shown below. Do not assume any facts not specifically stated. In particular, do not assume that consent has been obtained pursuant to Section 50 of the <cite>Planning Act</cite>, or that a transfer with the three <cite>Planning Act</cite> statements referred to in Subsection 50(22) has ever been registered, unless otherwise stated. Assume that &quot;North&quot; is at the top of the page.
<p>
(a) <b>12 1/2 MARKS (17 minutes)</b>
<p>
<center>
<table border cellpadding=10 width=50%>
<tr><th>X</th><th><center>W 1/2<br>Y</th><th>E 1/2<br>Y</th></tr>
</table></center>
<p>
<dd>Parcel X abuts Parcel Y. On January 1, 1991, Ann is the owner of X and Shirley is the owner of Y. In September of 1991, Ann conveys Parcel X to Shirley. As part of the purchase price, Shirley gives a mortgage back to Ann encumbering Parcel X. On closing, Shirley also grants a second mortgage in favour of the Bank, encumbering Parcel X. On December 1, 1991, a Plan of Subdivision was registered that included Parcel X and Parcel Y within its boundaries. Accordingly, as of December 1, 1991, Parcel X and Parcel Y were whole lots on a Plan of Subdivision. On January 1, 1994, the local municipality passed a By-Law lifting part lot control for the Plan of Subdivision that Parcel X and Parcel Y are part of. On September 1, 1994, Shirley sold the east half of Parcel Y to Malcolm. On October 1, 1994, the local municipality repealed the By-Law it had passed on January 1, 1994 and, therefore, the By-Law lifting part lot control for the registered plan that Parcel X and Parcel Y are part of ceased to have effect as of October 1, 1994. On December 1, 1995, Shirley sold the west half of Parcel Y to Lori. What is the effect of the subdivision control provisions of the <cite>Planning Act</cite> on these transactions?
<p>
(b) <b>12 1/2 MARKS (17 minutes)</b>
<p>
<center><table border cellpadding=10 width=50%>
<tr><th>D</th><th>E</th><th>F</th></tr>
</table></center>
<p>
D, E and F are not lots within a registered Plan of Subdivision. D abuts E. E abuts F. In 1976, Luke was the owner of D and E and Emma was the owner of F. In 1976, Luke obtained an unconditional consent from the local Committee of Adjustment to a mortgage by Luke to the Bank encumbering D. In 1985, Luke sold D to Brian. As part of the sale transaction, Brian gave a mortgage back to Luke encumbering D. In 1989, Luke sold E to Bonnie. In 1992, Emma sold F to Luke. Bonnie entered into an Agreement of Purchase and Sale on December 1, 1995 on the standard Toronto Real Estate Board form to sell E to Robert. What is the effect of the subdivision control provisions of the <cite>Planning Act</cite> on these transactions?
<p>
<b>TOTAL FOR QUESTION 2 IS 25 MARKS (Total estimated time for Question 2 - 34 minutes)</b>
<p><br>
3. You are a senior partner in a law firm known for its expertise in real estate matters. One of your valued clients has just telephoned and told you that she signed an agreement to purchase a new residential condominium unit on December 10, 1995. The condominium project which she has agreed to purchase a unit in is one of the most expensive projects ever in Toronto and the purchase price for her two bedroom unit is $1,200,000.00. Your client advises that the building will be ten storeys high and will have fantastic amenities. The developer has not yet started construction of the project, but units are selling very quickly.
<p>
<dd>Your client wants to meet with you tomorrow morning to go over the Agreement of Purchase and Sale and the Disclosure Statement which she received on the same day that she signed the Agreement of Purchase and Sale. She has never purchased a new residential condominium unit before, and she is having difficulty understanding when she has to pay monies to the condominium developer and what her rights are from the time that she signs the Agreement until the date that she acquires title.
<p>
<dd>Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on your viewpoint), you are leaving Toronto later this afternoon for a much deserved two week vacation in Mexico. Accordingly, you are going to be unable to meet with your client when she comes into the of fine tomorrow morning to deal with these issues.
<p>
<dd>Thankfully, the loyal and hardworking associate lawyer who works with you is available and will meet with your client tomorrow morning. However, the associate lawyer has never done a condominium transaction before and will be unable to provide the proper advice to your client tomorrow morning unless you can help him out by providing him with a memo that he can read over this afternoon and have with him when he meets with your client tomorrow morning.
<p>
<dd>The memorandum to the associate lawyer should set out the points that you wish him to discuss with your client when she attends at your of fine tomorrow morning. Obviously, you have not seen the Agreement of Purchase and Sale and you have not seen the Disclosure Statement. You will have to tell the associate lawyer in the memorandum what it is that he should watch out for in reading the material which the client brings in and, also, what protections, rights and remedies he should discuss with the client when they meet and after he reviews the documentation.
<p>
<dd>As you have other files to prepare memos on prior to your flight this afternoon, there is only a limited time that you have to set out the pertinent matters that the associate lawyer should know about prior to meeting with your client tomorrow morning. Accordingly, you only have time to deal with important points. Since your firm does not believe in formalities, you can design the memorandum to the associate lawyer in any way you wish.
<p>
<dd>Please prepare the memorandum to the associate lawyer.
<p>
<b>QUESTION 3 IS WORTH 20 MARKS (28 minutes)</b>
<p><br>
4. One of your clients, George, has just been served with a Statement of Claim in which Elaine has sued him on the covenant contained in a mortgage registered against Greenacre which George gave to Elaine in 1993. George had sold Greenacre to Kramer in 1994 and Kramer assumed Elaine's mortgage, with Elaine's approval, at that time. Unfortunately, Kramer encountered financial difficulties as a result of his failed investment in a small soup kitchen and Elaine sold Greenacre to Jerry two months ago under the power of sale contained in the mortgage. Due to the fact that the net sale proceeds that Elaine recovered were substantially less than the amount of the mortgage, she has sued both George and Kramer for the shortfall.
<p>
<dd>George is most upset at the turn of events and he is meeting with you this afternoon. George wants you to provide him with a written explanation of what his general rights and defences are under these circumstances and why it is that certain of his rights may be limited or certain defences unavailable to him. George also wants to know what additional information you will need in order to fully advise him of his rights and defences when you get together for your second meeting with him later in the week. George likes to know why things are the way they are and he is always appreciative of novel arguments that you might come up with.
<p>
<dd>Please prepare the written advice to George which he has asked for.
<p>

(30 Marks) QUESTION 1<p>
<dd>In 1993, the Venerable Bank (VB) agreed to provide a line of credit to Telephony (TY), a manufacturer of telephone equipment, which was to be secured by a Section 427 Bank Act security on TY's inventory. VB filed a notice of intention to give the Section 427 security interest in the regional office of the Bank of Canada on February 1, 1993, and TY signed a Section 427 security agreement in VB's favour before the line of credit became operative. This was the only security agreement concluded between the parties. On February 15, 1993, VB registered a financing statement in the Ontario Personal Property Security registry in which an &quot;X&quot; appeared in the &quot;Inventory&quot; box in the collateral classification section of the financing statement.
<p>
<dd>In May 1993, TY signed a contract with High-Tech Components (HTC) for the supply of TY's requirements of components for use in its manufacturing operations. The contract provided that HTC was to retain a security interest in the components so long as any part of the purchase price for components, whenever delivered, remained outstanding. TY also gave HTC a security interest in a patent licence it held for the manufacture of some of TY's equipment. HTC registered a financing statement on May 15, 1993 in which an &quot;X&quot; appeared in the &quot;Equipment&quot; and &quot;Other&quot; collateral boxes. The financing statement spelled TY's name as &quot;Telephonie&quot;. HTC gave no notice of its security interests to VB.
<p>
<dd>TY needed a diagnostic machine in its manufacturing operations and, on the recommendation of its treasurer, agreed to lease such a machine from the New Leasing Corporation (NLC). The lease was for a 5 year period and the rental was $1,000 a month. The lease gave TY a right of renewal of the lease for a second 5 year period at $100 a month. The lease also obliged TY to keep the machine insured and in a state of good repair, to pay all applicable taxes involving the machine and to assume full responsibility for its safety. If TY had purchased the machine outright the cash price would have been $50,000. NLC never registered a financing statement in respect of the lease.
<p>
<dd>In June 1994, HTC's lawyer discovered the error in the collateral description in HTC's financing statement of May 15, 1993, and filed a financing change statement substituting an &quot;X&quot; in the &quot;Inventory&quot; box for the &quot;X&quot; in the &quot;Equipment&quot; box. (The notation in the &quot;Other&quot; box was left unchanged.) At that time $50,000 was owing to HTC in respect of previous deliveries of components. Between then and December 1994, HTC made further deliveries of components to TY in the amount of $75,000.
<p>
<dd>The market for TY's products deteriorated sharply and, in December 1994, VB successfully presented a petition for TY's bankruptcy. Jane was appointed trustee in bankruptcy. At the time of the receiving order, $100,000 was owing to VB in respect of the 1993 Section 427 security agreement and $45,000 was owing to HTC. $25,000 of this amount represented deliveries made by HTC before June 1994; the balance of the debt represented deliveries made after this date. The total value of the inventory in Jane's hands is $40,000.
<blockquote>
ADVISE JANE:
<p>
(a) whether HTC has a perfected security interest in the components and, if so, for which amount;
<p>
(b) as between VB and HTC, which of their respective security interests in TY's inventory has priority;
<p>
(c) whether HTC obtained a valid security interest in TY's patent licence;
<p>
(d) whether NLC lease with TY constituted a security agreement and is therefore subject to the OPPSA perfection requirements.
</blockquote>
(In answering question (c) ignore any provisions in the federal Patents Act.)
<p><br>
(30 marks) QUESTION 2
<p>
<dd>Farmakare Corp. (FMK) is a distributor and retailer of pharmaceutical and personal and home care products. It has 20 retail outlets in various parts of Ontario, the premises of which are held by FMK on 10 and 20 year leases from various landlords. Because of the renewed recession, fierce competition among drug stores, and the impact of the prohibition on the sale of tobacco products in drug stores, FMK is suffering from cashflow problems as well as incurring a net loss in its current retail operations. FMK's debt picture looks as follows:
<p>
<dd><i>Outstanding Balances</i>
<ol>
<li><i>Shopping Centre Bank (SCB)</i>:<br>
Medium term loan secured by FMK's fixtures and equipment and the personal guarantee of FMK's executive directors. $150,000
<p>
<li><i>Your Friendly Bank (YFB)</i>:<br>
revolving line of credit repayable on demand and secured by FMK's receivables $250.000
<p>
<li><i>Six major drug manufacturers and ten suppliers</i> of home and personal care products, each of whom holds a security interest in 	respect of its supplies $250,000
<p>
<li><i>Ten landlords</i>:<br>
Arrears of rent $100,000
<p>
<li><i>Other unsecured creditors</i> $300,000
</ol>
<dd>FMK is anxious to explore the feasibility of a successful reorganization. It feels it would be able to make a positive recovery if the following conditions con he met:
<blockquote>
(a) that it can repudiate ten of the twenty realty leases;
<p>
(b) that it is permitted to treat all the secured creditors (items 1, 2, and 3 above) as a single class for voting purposes;
<p>
(c) that the rental arrears to the landlords (item 4) can be combined in one class with the claims of other unsecured creditors:
<p>
(d) unpaid suppliers of goods, including those in items 5 above, will not be able to demand return of their goods in the event of FMK filing an application under the CCAA or the BIA.
</blockquote>
<dd>ADVISE FMK's directors whether these conditions can be met and whether they can best be met by proceeding under the CCAA or by proceeding under the Part III.1 provisions of the BIA.
<p><br>
<center><h3>PART B</h3>
(Answer any <b>TWO</b> questions.)</center><p>

QUESTION 3
<p>
(10 marks) (a)&quot;How ironic! In the late 19th century, the equity courts invented the floating charge, thereby replacing the earlier doctrine of the implied licence for a debtor to sell inventory in the ordinary course of the debtor's business even though it is subject to a security interest. And now that the PPS Acts have abolished the equitable floating charge, the courts are rediscovering the implied licence doctrine but giving it a much broader reach that it ever had at common law&quot;. EXPLAIN the development referred to by the author.
<p>
(10 marks) (b) W Co. is a trucking company whose head office is located in Winnipeg. All of W's trucks were purchased on a conditional sale basis from the M Co. The financing statements were registered in Winnipeg pursuant to the Manitoba PPSA. On March 15, 1995, W Co. traded-in one of the trucks in Toronto to Value Co. (&quot;VC&quot;) in part payment of the purchase price of a new Value truck. VC retained a security interest in the new truck for the balance of the purchase price. VC did not know of the outstanding security interest against the traded-in truck and resold the truck to T Co. in the ordinary course of VC's business.
<p>
<dd>ADVISE M Co.:
<blockquote>
(a) whether T Co. obtained a clear title to the truck; and
<p>
(b) whether M Co. can claim a security interest in the Value truck and, if the answer is yes, whether its security interest will have priority over VC's security interest in the truck.
</blockquote>
<p><br>
QUESTION 4
<p>
(10 marks) (a) &quot;It is difficult to find a common denominator linking the impeachable pre-bankruptcy transactions covered in sections 91101 of the BIA. It is even more difficult to justify the existence of a parallel set of provincial provisions.&quot; DO YOU AGREE?
<p>
(10 marks) (b) The Lakeshore Bank (LB) made a loan of $50,000 to the No-Calorie Restaurant (NCR) on February 15, 1992 to enable NCL to renovate and refurbish the restaurant. The loan was secured by a security interest in all of the assets of NCR, with the exception of NCR's receivables. The loan was repayable in monthly instalments of $1,500. The agreement contained an acceleration clause entitling LB to demand repayment of the balance of the loan if any instalment was in arrears for more than 15 days. NCT fell into arrears with its payments and on November 1, 1992, LB advised NCR that it would enforce its security interest on or after November 4 unless the balance of the loan was paid before then.
<p>
ADVISE NCR:
<blockquote>
(a) whether LB's notice is a valid one; and
<p>
(b) whether NCR will be liable for any deficiency if LB seizes and sells the collateral and the sale price is not sufficient to cover the balance of the loan.
</blockquote>
<p><br>
(20 marks) QUESTION 5
<p>
<dd>&quot;Read by itself, section 20 of the OPPSA leaves the impression that consensually secured creditors trump all other interests so long as the security interest is perfected. The impression is quite misleading. The correct position 	is much more complex, and this for two reasons. The first is because of the existence of non-PPSA legislation creating non-consensual superpriority security interests. The second and still more important reason is because of the diluting effects of the 1992 amendments to the BIA. If there is room for complaint it is that the 1992 BIA amendments do not go far enough.&quot; DISCUSS.

[100 marks]
<p>
Jean Dufour, of Lyon, France, gave up his career as a biochemist to earn a medical degree and practice as a family doctor. Discouraged by the high rates of tax and bureaucratic red tape in France, he and his wife, Marie, decided early in 1992 to relocate in Ontario, together with their son, Claude, aged 22, and Jean's aged father, Henri. The family thought it in their best interest to retain their home in Lyon in case the Canadian experience did not work out. Jean's widowed sister, Francine, agreed to move in and look after the house. Jean had purchased it in 1965 for the equivalent of $100,000 ($40,000 for the house and $60,000 for the land). The value at the end of 1971 was $135,000 ($55,000 for the house and $80,000 for the land).
<p>
Henri had some regrets about leaving France, having purchased a vineyard in 1990 for the equivalent of $100,000.
The family arrived in Ontario in July, 1992, when the value of the house in Lyon was $200,000 ($80,000 for the building and $120,000 for the land), and the vineyard, $115,000.
<p>
Notwithstanding Jean's professional qualifications, the Ontario government agreed to grant him a license to practice medicine only if he was willing to locate in a community that was without adequate medical services, an &quot;underserviced designated area&quot;. He accepted the conditions and took the family to Espanola. To help him defray his settlement expenses, the government of Ontario paid him $50,000. He used virtually all of the money to purchase the practice - essentially the &quot;goodwill&quot; - of the only other medical doctor in Espanola, Dr. Kavorkian, who had had a remarkable number of fatalities among his patients and decided to retire.
<p>
He also purchased Dr. Kavorkian's residence for $150,000 and converted it into a medical office on the ground floor and living quarters on the second floor. (The allocation of the purchase price was $60,000 for the building and $90,000 for the three acres of land.)
<p>
Jean's practice prospered in the growing community, which was found to be increasingly attractive to tourists. With a view to profiting from the growth, he and three friends, Tom and Dick, who were real estate developers, and Harry, the local dentist, incorporated a company, Cashco Inc., which purchased a 20 acre parcel of land which they intended to develop into a small shopping plaza and motel to cater-to the tourist trade. Jean's view was that he could achieve long-term financial security in this way. Each paid $60,000 for his 25k of the issued shares. As they were ready to proceed with development, they learned to their great dismay that the site was heavily contaminated with waste from a nearby nuclear generator and totally unfit for development. The exorbitant cost of removing the contaminated soil caused the company to sell the land to the government for $1, so as to be free of any responsibility for the property. Cashco Inc. surrendered its charter.
<p>
Distressed by his financial setback, Jean's mind was not on his practice and in treating Richard Roe for a serious ailment, he prescribed the wrong medicine and thereby caused Mr. Roe severe injury. Mr. Roe recovered $300,000 in damages from Jean for pain and suffering, nursing care and lost wages while he was off work. Regrettably, Jean had failed to take out malpractice insurance and bore the cost personally. Also, the disciplinary committee of the Ontario Medical Association investigated the matter with a view to determining whether or not to withdraw Jean's license to practice. Jean engaged counsel to appear on his behalf at the hearings and paid legal fees of $75,000.
<p>
Although he retained his license, Jean and his family decided in April, 1994, to leave Espanola for Toronto. He sold his practice and received $80,000 for the goodwill. The contract of sale provided for a down payment of $20,000 and annual payments of $10,000 for the next six years. He rented his home/office to his successor for $3,000 per month.
<p>
As an experienced biochemist, he had little difficulty finding employment with Biochem Inc. in Toronto. As part of his compensation package, Jean received a generous salary and a stock option to purchase 10,000 shares in Biopharm Ltd., Biochem's parent company, for $10 per share for a period of ten years. The stock was trading for $12 per share on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
<p>
The company offered him three options with respect to his travel on company business: (1) Biochem would provide him with a $60,000 Lexus automobile and pay all operating expenses, which were estimated to run to $8,000 per annum. Although Jean expected to travel by air extensively in visiting the various offices of the company, he anticipated that he would drive the car annually about 40,000 km on business and 3,000 km for personal purposes. (2) He could use his own car and be paid 35 cents per km when he used it for company business. (3) He could receive $10,000 per year as a lump sum payment for using his own car on company business. He chose the third option, but wondered about the tax consequences of all three.
<p>
The company also agreed to send a member of the nursing staff to pay visits three times per week to Jean's father who, although in frail health, chose to live alone but did require care and attention.
<p>
Jean also persuaded the company to hire his son Claude as a trainee in the treasury department.
<p>
Jean gave his stock option to Marie, who exercised it by purchasing 10,000 shares in August, 1994, when Biopharm shares were trading at $15. She received dividends quarterly in the amount of 20 cents per share. In an increasingly high tech oriented world, the shares of Biopharm escalated rapidly and Marie was able to dispose of them for $30 in July, 1996.
<p>
With a view to fostering good staff relations, the company agreed to lend to Jean and other senior officers $100,000 each, interest-free, in order to help them make provision for their retirement. Jean agreed to repay the loan from his salary in such amounts as met with his convenience. He used the funds to purchase a variety of investments, including shares in Acme Hardware Inc., an Ontario private company, shares in Imperial Oil Limited, and Ontario government bonds, having a face value of $100 each and bearing interest of 9k, for which he paid $97.
<p>
Marie's financial position was given a fillip by her purchase of a lottery ticket from one of the local charities. She was delighted to win the prize and although she requested that it be paid in a lump sum of $135,000, it was a &quot;cash for life lottery&quot; so that the funds were paid to an insurance company, which contracted to pay her $1,000 per month for life.
<p>
Each summer the family returned to Lyon to spend a month with Jean's sister in the family home, using his frequent flyer points to pay for the airline tickets, which had a market value of $3,000.
<p>
Jean's father, Henri, was informed that the French government had expropriated his vineyard for the construction of a highway and that his compensation was the equivalent of $300,000. Although frail, Henri was sufficiently mentally alert to reinvest the total proceeds in a mushroom farm near Lyon.
<p>
Jean's son Claude, a member of the &quot;instant gratification&quot; set, sought more financial means than he earned as a treasury officer and embezzled $80,000 from the company in September, 1994. The fraud was quickly discovered and Claude was charged with embezzlement. Because he had returned the funds to the company in May, 1995, prior to his trial (at which he pleaded guilty), he received a relatively short jail sentence.
<p>
The event soured relations between Jean and Biochem, which suggested he seek employment elsewhere. It forgave the outstanding loan of $100,000.
<p>
Jean formed his own biochemical company, Biodyne, Inc., paying $50,000 for all the issued shares. He exercised his talents as a biochemist to create a new product, Tylaprin, a pain reliever, which the company patented. It granted exclusive three-year licenses to manufacturers in Chicago (to cover North American distribution), Buenos Aires (Central and South America), London (Europe) and Tokyo (Asia), for lump sum payments totalling $1.5 million and a 10k royalty.
<p>
Henri returned to France to live in April 1997 in order to look after his mushroom farm.
<p>
When Claude was released from jail, in October 1997, the family decided to make a clean break with Canada and return to their home in Lyon, which had increased in value to $300,000 ($120,000 for the house and $180,000 for the land). Prior to departing, Jean sold the shares in his company, Biodyne, to Chemco Limited for 10k of Biodyne's profits for the next four years up to a total of $2 million.
<p>
He disposed of the house in Espanola for $400,000 ($150,000 for the house and $250,000 for the three acres), but retained the shares in Acme Hardware and Imperial Oil and the bonds.
<p>
Discuss the tax consequences of these events for Jean, Marie, Claude, Henri, Richard Roe, Cashco, Biochem and Biodyne.

<dd>The Peters family has a vacation home in Bel Sol, a summer resort community that was recently constructed in the wilderness north of the city of Flavelle. The water for this home comes from a well that was dug beside it. This water, however, has now become undrinkable for two reasons, either of which by itself would have sufficed to ruin the water.
<p>
<dd>The first reason is that the Thanatos Chemical Works factory, a few kilometres from Bel Sol, spews forth pollution that falls to the earth with every rainfall and then contaminates the sources for the wells at Bel Sol. The Thanatos Chemical Works has been at this location for decades. Indeed, it set up its factory here in order to be far from any urban districts that might complain about the deleterious effects of its pollution. The only other inhabitants of this area are the residents of the town of Styx, from which Thanatos draws its work force. The water in Styx is also undrinkable, but Thanatos has a longstanding arrangement with the residents of Styx under which Thanatos delivers bottled water free. Thanatos is willing in the future to extend this arrangement to the Peters family and other vacationers in Bel Sol. The value of Thanatos' investment in its factory far exceeds the value of all the vacation homes in Bel Sol, and Thanatos is the only employer in the area.
<p>
<dd>The second reason is an incident that happened shortly after the Peters family went to Bel Sol for the first time. A package was delivered to them by Courier Express Co. The Courier driver left his truck idling while he went through the formalities of having the package signed for. While this was going on, the Peters' neighbours' eight-year-old son, Dennis, climbed into the truck and began to play with the steering wheel and the levers. He unknowingly released the emergency brake, and when the truck began to move, he chortled with delight and began to steer it. The truck left the road and came to a stop on the lawn beside the Peters house, exactly over the septic tank. The septic tank is usually strong enough to bear a heavy weight, but a few moments before the delivery there had been a very slight earth tremor that did no noticeable damage but weakened the septic tank, so that the tank cracked when the truck came to rest above it. The material in the septic tank then oozed out and contaminated the well, which was beside it.
<p>
<dd>The Peters now want to sue Thanatos, Courier, and Dennis for damages, and they want an injunction against Thanatos. Discuss the tort issues that arise on these facts. Where appropriate, set out the different possible approaches to liability and briefly assess the justice or the desirability of these approaches.

<dd>On a hot summer evening in July 1994, Larry Green decided to go out for a stroll. While walking down the main street of Floodsville, he noticed that a fire had started in the top floor of a recently constructed four storey apartment building, and that a small crowd had assembled outside, unsure what to do. Larry rushed to the scene and
asked the building superintendent, who was in the crowd, whether anyone was still inside. The superintendent answered that he had been told by two 11 year-old boys that there was a baby still trapped on the top floor, but that the fire department was on its way.
<p>
<dd>Larry said that he would try to get the baby out. Before rushing into the building, he yelled to the superintendent to turn off the electrical current to the building. This the superintendent tried to do by hitting what he thought was the main switch, a switch that would have shut off all electricity in the building. In fact, he hit an auxiliary switch which normally would cut off the current to the first floor of the building only. (Apparently, it has recently become common practice for Floodsville building contractors to have separate auxiliary switches for the first floor of new buildings; this is because spring flooding is not uncommon in the area and while electricity needs to be cut off on the first floor for safety reasons during these floods, a separate switch permits continued use of the upper floors of the building.)
<p>
<dd>Larry never did make it out of the building alive. Indeed, the medical evidence is that, being asthmatic, he was almost immediately overcome by smoke inhalation and passed out on the first floor. However, the coroner has determined that Larry actually died of electrocution. It seems that the electrical company, Sparks Ltd., which services the building, had on some earlier occasion negligently transposed two wires in the auxiliary switch in such a way that the electrical current could not be shut off at that switch. Thus, when water from the building's sprinkler system began to flood the building, it conducted electricity from the live wires on the first floor to the spot where Larry had passed out. The fire chief has indicated, however, that Larry's attempt to save the baby on the fourth floor was so &quot;idiotic&quot; that, in all probability, he would have died from smoke inhalation in any event by the time he reached the fourth floor. His advice is always that one should never enter a burning building in such circumstances.
<p>
<dd>Imagine that you are an articling student for the law firm retained by Larry's estate to seek damages for wrongful death in this case. Write a memorandum advising the senior partner who is handling the case for the firm as to the estate's prospects for recovering damages. Assume that at the time you write the memorandum, there is no damage on how the fire was originally started. Also note that it has turned out that there never was a baby inside the burning building; the two boys only told the superintendent this as a practical joke. If you think you need any additional facts to address a legal issue, specify what facts you need and why.

<dd>The Headstart Factory has been manufacturing paint in the same location for over thirty years. The factory employs women who have just been released from prison and attempts to assist them in their efforts to re-integrate into the community. The factory disposes of its waste by burying it in pits near a stream that runs alongside their property. This is in conformity with all applicable laws, but left-over solvents nonetheless end up filtering into the stream. While Headstart is not a non-profit enterprise, it does operate on a very limited budget. According to Headstart. it could not continue to operate if it had to dispose of its wastes in any other way.
<p>
<dd>In recent years, the area around Headstart and the other factories has begun to change. A developer purchased the vacant surrounding land and then developed the residential community of Silver Stream within a few miles of Headstart. Although the community's drinking water is filtered and purified, its source is the stream which runs by Headstart. Residents of Silver Stream complain that their water smells and tastes extremely unpleasant, although there are no adverse health effects. They traced this back to the paint-related waste dumped by Headstart. Further, some of the residents of Silver Stream are very concerned about the criminal propensities of the women who work there. They fear that the women might damage their homes or families. In order to deal with these problems, the residents are thinking of starting an action in nuisance.
<p>
<dd>One of the residents of this community, Maeve, also has a related problem. Shortly after Maeve moved to Silver Stream, she became pregnant. Like many of the residents she and her partner often took an evening stroll on a path that ran beside the stream. One evening, as they were strolling, a group of adolescent boys on mountain bikes tore along the path. Maeve jumped off the path and fell into the stream. Maeve showed no signs of injury but when she gave birth, her child, Cora, was severely underweight. It turned out that Cora's condition was caused by pre-natal exposure to a particular type of solvent. Maeve's investigations revealed that the untreated creek water contained very elevated levels of this solvent and that the source of the solvent was the Headstart factory.
<p>
<dd>In order to remedy her condition, Cora required a blood transfusion. Because of widespread concern about the safety of the blood supply, Maeve's sister, Sheila, gave blood so that the baby could have the necessary transfusion. As a result of this transfusion, Sheila was too weak to work for several weeks.
<p>
<dd>Although Cora survived, she remained very small and frail for several years and consequently suffered several serious illnesses. Now, both Cora and Sheila are contemplating a negligence action against Headstart.
<p>
<dd>Discuss the liability of Headstart on these facts.

[20 marks] <b>Q1.</b> Alan, after many years service in the management of a company, lost his job as a result of a corporate &quot;downsizing&quot;. Still in his mid-fifties, he could not afford to retire, and was unable to find any similar employment. He decided to go into business for himself, using his savings and severance settlement from his former employer for his start-up capital. His major other asset was his house, of which he was the sole owner. Alan had a second wife, Wilma, and three children by his deceased first wife, Barton, Celia and Doreen. Alan had consultations with a self-designated &quot;business consultant&quot;, who suggested that Alan try to safeguard his non-business assets from the risks of failure of the new business. On the consultant's suggestion, Alan proposed to transfer the house to Wilma and his son Barton as tenants in common, in equal shares. He told Wilma and all of the children that he was doing this &quot;to protect the family&quot;. The conveyance to Wilma and Barton was duly made. The lawyer who prepared and registered the conveyance was not told anything about its purpose.
<p>
<dd>The business in fact prospered from the start. When Alan died suddenly and unexpectedly a dozen years later, it was not only solvent, but had substantial cash reserves. At Alan's death, the title to the house still remained in the names of Wilma and Barton.
<p>
<dd>Alan's valid last will left his estate to Wilma for life, remainder to Barton, Celia and Doreen in equal shares.
Reliable Trust Company, the Estate Trustee [executor] of Alan's will, asked Wilma and Barton to reconvey their interests in the house to the Estate Trustee, in order that it might be administered and ultimately distributed according to Alan's will. Wilma and Barton have refused to do so.
<p>
<dd><b>Assess the legal position of Reliable Trust Company in an action against Wilma and Barton to recover the house for the benefit of Alan's estate.</b>
<p><br>
[30 marks] <b>Q2.</b> Thomas made a valid, &quot;home-made&quot; will which read as follows:
<p>
<dd>&quot;I leave $150,000 to my wife, Alma, to make use of as she pleases. When Alma dies, any of this -money which she hasn't spent is to go to my half-brother Victor, who will be aware of my expectations concerning its employment. All of the rest of my property is to go to my half-sister Barbara. Victor is to be the executor of my estate.&quot;
<p>
<dd>The will was dated and made on April 1, 1994. A few days later, Thomas handed to Victor a sealed envelope, saying, &quot;There is a note about my will in here, following up on what we talked about in January this year. Put it in your safety deposit box and don't open it until after my death.&quot;
<p>
<dd>In January, 1994, Thomas and Victor had had a conversation in which Thomas told Victor that he proposed to make a gift in his will to Victor &quot;of what was left of $150,000 after Alma was looked after.&quot; He reminded Victor that Alma was seriously ill and probably wouldn't live long enough to use up much of this sum. He told Victor that he wanted Victor to make use of this money to assist &quot;some of my [Thomas'] mother's family.&quot; Thomas was the child of his father's first marriage, while Victor and Barbara were the children of his father's second marriage. Thomas told Victor that he did not want to put the details respecting this provision in his will, which would become a public document, and that he could not even bring himself to discuss them with Victor. He would write Victor a letter giving necessary details. Victor agreed to carry out whatever were Thomas' wishes respecting any money he would receive under Thomas' will, as long as this was not unlawful.
<p>
<dd>Thomas died in September, 1995. Alma survived him, but died shortly thereafter, before any part of the $150,000 referred to in Thomas' will could be paid over to her Alma's will provided that, if Thomas predeceased her, as happened, her estate would be given to the University of Trawna.
<p>
<dd>After the death of Thomas, Victor opened the envelope that Thomas had given to him. It contained a typed letter, signed by Thomas, which read:
<blockquote>
&quot;Dear Victor,
<p>
<dd>The family members I asked you to assist are my three cousins, the children of a sister of my late mother. [The letter then gave names and addresses.] Each has a serious mental impairment. Other members of my mother's family have had similar impairments, so it seems that there may be some genetic problem. That is why Alma and I have never had children.
<p>
<dd>My cousins cannot function well enough to make any significant contribution to their own support, although there is some variance among them in their abilities. They depend upon income from their late parents' estates, but this is just barely enough to meet their basic needs. At my mother's last request, I have supplemented their support, and supplied a more generous lifestyle for them, when I was able to do so. I would like you to continue this for me, using the money you get from me as you think it is needed. I hope you will be generous, as they enjoy trips away from home, with suitable companions, of course, and other little luxuries. There will likely be considerable left over anyway, as they have short life expectancies, but even if there isn't, you have a good job and plenty of money of your own anyway. Thanks for your help, and best wishes to you.&quot;
</blockquote>
<dd>Victor located the cousins, and investigated their circumstances. Before he could take further action regarding any of them, the cousins, who were taking a bus trip together, were killed when the bus was in an accident.
<p>
Victor consults you. He considers that his responsibilities concerning the cousins have now ceased, and he is entitled to keep the $150,000 given by Thomas' will, and still not distributed from Thomas' estate, for himself. To his surprise and chagrin, his sister Barbara and the University of Trawna are each claiming that they are entitled to it. In addition, another cousin of Thomas, on his mother's side, one Xaviera, who is the sole next of kin of the cousins referred to in Thomas' letter, and who, by reason of their deaths intestate, is therefore ultimately entitled to receive the proceeds of the entire estate of each of them, claims that the $150,000 should be paid in equal shares to the estates of the three cousins. from which the money will make its way to her.
<p>
<dd><b>Who is entitled to receive the sum of $150,000 from the estate of Thomas?</b>
<p><br>
[25 marks] <b>Q3.</b> Goodfellow, who died recently, had lacked testamentary capacity for over a quarter-century, as a result of a head injury. While still capacitated, he had been a very successful business man, and an active and enthusiastic member of the Rhinoceros Club. This was an unincorporated association of men who banded together to promote both conviviality among themselves and service to the community. The Club held monthly dinner meetings, to hear invited speakers, and to enable the members to enjoy each other's company. However, in their more serious moments, the Club members devoted much time and money to furthering public-spirited projects, ranging from organizing and funding eye examinations of local school-children to supporting projects of international scope, usually health-related.
<p>
<dd>Goodfellow, at the time he suffered the accident, was a very wealthy man. He was a childless bachelor, and had spent his vacations travelling widely throughout the world, including areas seldom visited by travellers from the so-called &quot;Western world&quot;. He observed many persons, both locally and abroad, suffering and dying from a disease, bigpox, for want of vaccination. His own sister had died of this disease while still a child. While still capacitated, he persuaded the Rhinoceros Club to take up, as one of its major causes, the support of an increased attack against this disease.
<p>
<dd>At his death, Goodfellow's will, executed many years previously while he was still of sound mind, gave his entire fortune in the following terms.
<blockquote>
&quot;I give all the property I may own at my death, after payment of my debts and funeral expenses, to the Rhinoceros Club, of Ourtown, Ontario, the capital and income to be employed by the Club to reduce the incidence and effects of bigpox throughout the world. I wish the Club to do this by publicizing the effectiveness of vaccine, by persuading public and private agencies in various lands to develop means of widespread vaccination, by subsidizing the purchase of vaccine or supplying free of vaccine, and by training local persons to administer vaccines where there is a shortage of trained medical persons&quot;.
</blockquote>
<dd>Over the years of Goodfellow's incapacity, the value of his already large estate increased greatly, due to wise and fortunate investment decisions by those administering it. The Club is prepared to accept the responsibility of applying this fortune in the spirit of Goodfellow's desires, but two major problems face it.
<p>
<dd>First, over the years since Goodfellow made his will, world-wide efforts appear to have effectively wiped out the disease, bigpox, through improved vaccine and widespread usage of it. The Club has made enquiries of international health agencies, and has been advised that there is so little likelihood of finding any area where there is now any incidence of the disease that the Goodfellow inheritance cannot usefully be employed as stipulated.
Second, one Snively, who can prove that he is the nearest next-of-kin of Goodfellow now living, and that he is entitled to any portion of Goodfellow's estate not validly disposed of by Goodfellow's will, has demanded that all the capital of Goodfellow's estate he paid to him.
<p>
<dd>The executive of the Club does not want to give up this money to Snively. The Club, by unanimous vote of its members, wants to use the funds to combat some other worldwide dread disease. such as AIDS. The Club consults you.
<p>
<dd><b>Discuss the relative positions of the Club and of Snively.</b>
<p><br>
[25 marks] <b>Q4.</b>You are Smythe, a junior associate at a law firm in Ontario. You receive the following memo from a partner:
<p>
&quot;Smythe&quot;:
<p>
<dd>We act for the estate of Wimp. Wimp was a biochemist. He discovered a new drug, tentatively called &quot;Wimpazole&quot;, which, when added to animal food, makes animals grow fatter and better. Wimp's drug appears to be significantly more efficient than any competitor on the market, and was believed to be harmless to humans. Wimp's previous lawyer suggested that he not patent the drug, but keep it as a secret process, at least until he could work out the most advantageous financial deal for himself. Wimp followed this advice.
<p>
<dd>Wimp, on his own, could not raise the financing necessary to bring Wimpazole to market. He was introduced to executives of Rex Kong Gorilla Foods Inc. (hereafter referred to as &quot;Rex Kong&quot;), a major animal food manufacturer. After negotiations, Rex Kong agreed with Wimp that Rex Kong would manufacture and market Wimpazole, in consideration of an agreed royalty to Wimp. However, this was subject to the product, as tested in Rex Kong's and government laboratories, meeting the claims Wimp made for it, and also receiving government approval with respect to its safety for animals and humans. If it failed either of these requirements, the contract was to be at an end. Rex Kong would not further use or deal with the formula which Wimp had delivered to it for testing, but would return to Wimp all copies of that formula in its possession. After the contract was signed, Wimp handed over his formula to Rex Kong.
<p>
<dd>Rex Kong immediately began extensive laboratory tests, and controlled tests on animals. At a fairly early stage of these tests, there were preliminary indications that, in some rare circumstances, Wimpazole could have an adverse effect on animals, and possibly on humans who might subsequently eat meat derived from animals treated with the drug. Without referring the matter to Wimp, who had been rendered incapable by a stroke, Rex Kong's scientists went to work on the problem, and solved it by making a minor change to Wimp's formula. While continuing the testing of the original Wimpazole, Rex Kong instituted a parallel series of tests of the amended formula, which it called Kongitol. When the tests were completed, the government authorities refused to licence Wimpazole for distribution, but did licence Kongitol. Rex Kong then declared its contract with Wimp to be at an end, and, as Wimp had now died, returned to Wimp's Estate Trustee all copies in its possession of the original formula for Wimpazole. It is now marketing Kongitol, and making a lot of money on it.
<p>
<dd>Wimp's Estate Trustee [executor] has instructed us to sue Rex Kong. Several associates are working on possible claims in contract and in tort. I wonder if there is a possible cause of action in equity, particularly if this might lead to Wimp's estate attaining some ownership interest in Kongitol.
<p>
<dd><b>Write me a memo on the possibility of such an equitable claim in the above circumstances.</b>

1. [<i>Note: At the end of this question are a series of questions based on this fact situation. The total
value of all questions based on this fact situation is 50 marks.</i>]
<p>
In 1988, Ted made a valid, witnessed will, which contained the following provisions, among others:
<blockquote>
&quot;I give and devise my farm real property in Harris Township to my son Caspar, or his estate.
<p>
I give all the rest and residue of my estate real and personal, to which I may be entitled at my death to my daughter, Donna, or her estate.&quot;
</blockquote>
Ted died recently. This 1988 will was found among his papers, but, on the last page, following the signatures of Ted and of the witnesses, was a handwritten note, in Ted's handwriting, as follows:
<blockquote>
&quot;July 15, 1993. I want my niece, Ellen East, to have the one hectare parcel, containing the small cottage, which used to be used for our hired man, at the north-east corner of the farm&quot;. [Signed] Ted Testator&quot;
</blockquote>
As found after Ted's death, the sheet of paper containing the 1988 will had been cut completely across, immediately below the signatures of Ted and the original witness, and immediately above the handwritten note of July 15, 1993. That handwritten note had been attached to the cut original 1988 page with transparent tape on both sides of the page. The cut edges of the top and bottom pieces of the page matched exactly.
<p>
Reliable Trust Company, the Estate Trustee [executor] named in the 1988 will, tells you that it has ascertained the following facts:
<blockquote>
(i) According to the witnesses to the 1988 will, there was no writing of any kind following the signatures of Ted and the witnesses on that will at the time it was executed. There was a blank space a few inches deep after those signatures.
<p>
(ii) T had been a widower for a number of years. Ellen, a daughter of Ted's sister, had come to live at Ted's home, after the death of her parents in 1990. She was then in her mid-teens. In 1993, Ted told her, and several other people, that he wanted her to have a home of her own, as her parents had left her very little on their deaths. He proposed to give her the &quot;hired man's cottage&quot;, which stood on an enclosed one hectare parcel of the lands he was farming.
<p>
(iii) Ted was a person of very strict views about personal morality, and he tried to impose them on Ellen. Ellen had been rebelling against Ted's attitude, and matters come to a head when Ted, who had heard gossip in town that Ellen had been having an affair with a young man whose local reputation was rather poor, and was pregnant by him, confronted her with this story. In fact, this gossip was completely untrue. Ellen had dated this man a few times on a casual basis, had not had an affair with him, and was not pregnant. However, when Ted accused her of these alleged facts, she flared up, told him that her conduct was none of his business and, without bothering to deny the accusation, immediately moved out of the farmhouse to an apartment in town.
<p>
(iv) A few days after Ellen left Ted's home, Ted was discussing the incident with a friend. He was still very angry. He said to his friend, &quot;Ellen will never get any of my property. I shouldn't have let her have any of the property which should go to my children.&quot; Then he said, &quot;That reminds me,&quot; went to a drawer, took out an envelope on which was written, &quot;Last Will&quot;, removed a document from the envelope, and, with scissors, cut a piece off the last sheet. He put the remaining part of the document back into the envelope, and, put the envelope back into the drawer, tossing the cut-off piece in with it. The friend saw that the cut-off piece had handwriting on it, although he could not read it from where he sat.
<p>
(v) A short time before his death, Ted learned that the story about Cynthia's alleged affair and pregnancy was untrue. Ted wrote to Cynthia apologising for his conduct. In his letter he said, &quot;In my anger, I took the cottage from you, but don't worry, I have changed my mind about that, and given it back to you after I die.&quot;
<p>
(vi) At the time Ted made his will, he was farming 300 hectares in Harris Township. Of this tract, 200 hectares [&quot;Parcel A&quot;] had been the farm of his late father. Under his father's will, the farm had been left to his executors and trustees upon trust to sell the farm, invest the proceeds, and pay the income of those proceeds to Ted's mother for her life, and then to pay the capital to Ted and his sister (Ellen's mother) in equal shares. Ted had purchased his sister's interest in the remainder, and then made an agreement with his mother. By this agreement, Ted and his mother requested his father's trustees not to sell the farm during the lifetimes of Ted and his mother and the
survivor of them. Ted then operated the farm and paid his mother an agreed share of the farm income in lieu of her life income from the proceeds. At Ted's death, the title to this property was still in the hands of the executors of his father's estate.
<p>
The remaining 100 hectares, [&quot;Parcel B&quot;] which adjoined Parcel A, on the east thereof, had been purchased by Ted shortly after his father's death. He farmed this Parcel, along with Parcel A, as one operation, and his agreement with this mother calculated her share of income on the basis of the income from both parcels.
(vii) The &quot;hired man's cottage&quot; property [&quot;Parcel C&quot;] was part of Parcel B.
<p>
(viii) In 1993, Ted bought a ten hectare parcel of land [&quot;Parcel D&quot;], also in Harris Township. This was under cultivation as a fruit orchard. This orchard, which Ted always referred to as &quot;the fruit farm&quot;, was situated a few kilometres away from Parcels A and B. Ted had often told friends and members of his family that the fruit farm was being left to Donna, &quot;because Caspar was getting the farm&quot;, and he wanted Donna to have some land of her own.
<p>
(ix) Caspar, who is Ted's only surviving issue, and Ellen survived Ted. Ted's mother had died about a year before Ted's death. Donna had died shortly before Ted's death. She was separated, but not divorced, from her husband Frank, who survived Ted. Donna had no children or other issue. She left a valid will which after leaving a legacy to her brother Caspar, left all the rest of her property to her church.

<center><h3>PART B</h3></center>
3. Client Bob Jones, age 50, has come to see lawyer Sally Smith for some estate planning advice. While Bob was waiting for Smith in her office reception area, Bob completed a checklist of assets. Smith regularly uses the checklist to speed up the interview process. (Smith claims that before she instituted the checklist, she was wasting too much time with clients as they babbled on about family matters.) From this checklist, Smith learns that Bob has a substantial investment in shares of three public companies. Two of these companies have been very profitable and the shares have increased in value since Bob acquired them. These shares also generate ordinary cash dividends and stock dividends on a regular basis. The investment in one company has decreased in value since acquisition. Bob also owns some term deposits, and owns all the common shares of his business, Bobco, which manufactures hightech products. This industry is growing and Bob's company is quite successful.
<p>
When Smith met with Bob, he mentioned that he no longer owns his home. It was sold when he and his wife Betty were experiencing marital difficulties a few years ago. (The principal residence exemption was claimed at that time.) Although they have since reconciled, Bob feels that the marriage is on somewhat shaky ground. He neglected to mention any of this in the checklist. Bob now lives in a rented home with his wife Betty and their three children Matt age 20, Jeff age 15, and Joe age 11. Matt is in University, and Bob anticipates that the other boys will attend University as well. Bob's mother, Nan, also lives in the home with Bob and his family, and in exchange for helping with the children, Bob provides financial support to his mother. Except for a small pension, this is Nan's only income.
<p>
Bob also tells Smith that he was the Executor of his neighbor Jane's estate. Bob says that acting as the Executor of Jane's estate was very easy. Jane's will had divided her estate between her 2 adult children and a 12 year old grandchild. (The grandchild is the child of a son of Jane who had predeceased her). The adult children told Bob that they did not want the grandchild to share and so Bob simply divided the estate between the 2 adult children. Bob also told Smith that, as Executor, he did not worry about Jane's creditors or taxes since as far as he knew Jane had no debts and she once admitted to him that she never paid income tax. Bob says he was quite flattered that Jane had selected him to act as Executor.  Bob would like to return the compliment by naming Jane the Executor of his estate. 
<p>
Bob has asked Smith for some inter vivos estate planning advice and to prepare a will. Smith is extremely busy and prepares a memo to her junior with the information Bob has given to her. Smith's secretary, upon reading the memo, tells Smith that while Bob was in the reception area, he took some pills and told Smith's secretary that he was quite ill. Smith is somewhat surprised by this information, given Bob's robust appearance, and the fact that there was no mention of his health in the meeting.
<blockquote>
<b>Assume that you are the junior lawyer. Prepare a memorandum for Smith</b>
<p>
[17 1/2 marks] <b>(i) discussing the inter vivos estate planning advice which should be given to Bob Jones;</b>
<p>
[17 1/2 marks] <b>(ii) discussing the critical issues to be addressed when considering Bob Jones' will.</b>

<b>Note: In your memorandum, there is no need to discuss the principal residence rules.</b>

<h2>Advanced Problems in Contract Law<br>
Spring 1995<br>
Professor Hadfield<br>
Final Exam</h2></center>
<p>
This is a 24 hour take-home exam. You are permitted to discuss the exam with classmates who are taking the exam during the same 24-hour period and to consult whatever written materials you choose. Your answer, however, must be prepared by you and may not be the result of collaboration beyond discussion of the issues raised.
<p>
Your answer must not exceed 2500 words (approximately 10 pages of regular type). You may assume that I am familiar with the materials we have covered in the class and need not recapitulate what we have studied. I am interested in your analysis of the problem, the application of the ideas we have studied and your understanding of the institution of contracting. I strongly encourage you not to engage in any research; the best answers will be the product of thoughtful application of the materials covered in the course.
<p>
I have included as part of the materials on which you can draw in preparing your answer a section from a book discussing contracts in custom software. Please avoid the mistake of believing that whatever the author in this book said about how to structure a contract is correct. Use the material to think about the contracting problem posed in this exam but use it critically; question whether it is a good description of the contracting problem posed and whether the author has considered the full range of issues you would want to consider in structuring a contract in this case. Question authority: it may be right, it may be wrong.
<P>
You have been asked by a small (10 person) software engineering
firm, Software Inc., to advise them about a project they are considering
undertaking. Software Inc., has recently been approached by a
newly established partnership, Marketing Options Inc. The principals
in Marketing Options (MO) have developed a business plan to provide
fast, accurate, interactive marketing support and information
for small businesses. They envision serving a wide range of needs--keeping
small businesses up-to-date with on-line interactive access to
data relevant to their markets, helping to design and execute
market surveys by identifying common needs among a number of small
firms, providing traditional and on-line marketing expertise and
advice, and so on. MO is headed up by a recently-graduated MBA
and an ex-marketing executive from a large consumer products company;
they appear to have substantial venture capital to finance the
company. They have sought out Software Inc. for the design and
installation of the computer software that will form the heart
of their operation. MO has no expertise in computer systems and
is still in the development phase in designing the service it
will provide; it has indicated that it will be seeking input from
Software on how computing technology can help to accomplish the
business goals they have set for the company.
<P>
Your client, Software Inc., has thus far only undertaken small
projects involving modifications to existing software systems
that need relatively minor adjustments to suit a customer's needs.
This is the first large custom-design project they have considered
taking on. They are seeking your advice about how to structure
their relationship with MO. Software Inc. has brought you a chapter
from a book they found at the public library about computer contracts
with a suggested custom software contract. When asked if the discussion
of the design process in the book corresponds with what they anticipate
will be the case in this project, the president of the company
shrugged, saying that he had read and understood the chapter but
that the company has not yet had extensive experience in custom-design work and
that he isn't sure if this project is a typical custom-design
project. They want your feedback about the contract and any other
advice you can give them about how to structure their relationship.
At this stage, they want only an outline of their options, the
concerns they should have about the nature of their contractual
relationship with MO, and any particular problems or advantages
you see to the contract they have provided you. They have not
asked you to negotiate or draft a contract for them nor to give
them advice about copyright or warranty issues, except as these
might impact the overall question of how to structure the relationship.
Please prepare a ten-page (2500 word) memo addressing their questions
and noting where you would like more information in order to advise
them better. To keep it brief, it is acceptable to &quot;flag&quot;
issues for further analysis, but be sure to provide analysis of
what you think to be the core concerns at this stage.
<P>
<h2>8 Contracts for Custom Software Development</h2>
<P>
<h3><i>WHAT'S 'CUSTOM' SOFTWARE'?</I></h3>
<P>
There is no standard definition of  'custom' software. It is tempting
to define it as all software which is not standard, but then 'standard'
software can equally be deemed as all software which is not custom!
<P>
In the context of this chapter, custom software is software, usually
a whole system, which is designed and produced for a single client.
While many of the component items of the system may have been
used before, and therefore are themselves 'standard', the whole
system is unique. It is this uniqueness that gives rise to many
of the special problems associated with the development of custom
software.
<P>
The development process usually falls into three stages. The First
stage involves an initial analysis by the vendor of the customer's
requirements. This process is usually done before the contract
is entered into, and often forms part of the tendering process.
The next stage involves the preparation of a detailed design for
the system. During this stage the vendor must learn from the customer
the details of the aspects of the customer's business which will
be solved by the software, and design a system to meet those needs
which will run efficiently on the customer's hardware system.
The third stage involves implementing the design by actually writing
tile software compiling it to run on the customer's machine, and
installing it on that machine. A possible fourth stage is the
maintenance of the software once it is installed, but this is
usually the subject of a separate contract.
<P>
Because each piece of custom development is unique, no one knows
at the outset exactly what is being contracted for. It is this
uncertainty of scope which gives rise to most of the problems
- and associated litigation-connected with the development of
custom software. It is usually the case that the client is entering
a contract for development for a software system because he does not have the necessary  expertise
to do the development himself. The parties therefore came into
the contractual relationship from two mutually exclusive areas
of expertise; the software vendor is an expert  in designing and
programming software but knows nothing about  the client's business for which
the software is needed, and the client is an expert in his own
business but knows nothing about software design and production. Both areas
of expertise must be combined in order to produce a software system
which  meets the client's needs.
<P>
This process of combining the two areas of expertise is usually
an iterative one which takes place continuously during the development
process. It is an almost universal experience that one result
of this joint learning process is that the scope of the project
expands considerably  during development unless careful control is exercised. As the
client learns more about the software he realises that there are improvements
and refinements to his procedures which become possible with a
computer. The systems analyst sees enhancements to the original
design that would improve the whole system as he learns more about the
client's business.
<P>
Uncontrolled growth in the scope of the project causes many problems
which can result in a total breakdown of relations between the
vendor and the client. The main problems are:
<P>
(a) Increased cost: in the ease of a fixed-price contract this
can put the vendor in serious financial difficulties, and may
even drive him into insolvency; in the ease of a time-and-materials
contract the client has the financial problems which will make
him extremely unhappy even if he is not made insolvent. Typically,
an estimate of' the total cost will have been given at the outset.
The client, who is unsophisticated in the area of software development,
will not understand why this estimate bears no relationship to
the final cost, and certainly will not understand that at least
part of the blame for the increase is due to his own increased
expectations.
<P>
(b) Late delivery, which can cause the client serious business
losses if the software system is essential to his business.
<P>
(c) More computer time is required for the development, which
can seriously tie up the client's facilities.
<P>
(d) Changes made after programming has started can cause problems
and bugs in the part of the system already programmed.
<P>
(e) The increased demands on the vendor's staff can cause the vendor to have problems staffing other projects, thus causing difficulties with other  clients.
<P>
<h3><i>COMMON PROBLEMS IN CUSTOM SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT</i></h3>
<P>
This almost universally experienced expansion in scope of the
project during development results in a number of common problems.
Other problems result from the nature of the contract, and from
the structure of the industry. The most common of these problems
involve money. Everybody knows that financial problems are the
problems most likely to lead to a breakdown in friendly relations
and to litigation in any relationship, including marriage. 
<p>
Most software development contracts are on some sort of fixed-price
basis, the pricing being related to deliverables of some sort.
Some  vendors charge by the line of code, others have methods of dividing
the software into modules, and charging according to the number
of modules. The vendor will have performed an initial analysis
or the system required, usually as part of the bidding process,
will have estimated the number of deliverables required, and thereby
estimated the price. Here is an immediate source of trouble. The
initial analysis is done at the very beginning of the mutual learning
process. For this reason the estimate given is almost always too
low. Even though an increase in scope during development is the
common experience, vendors rarely anticipate the size of this
increase. This is partly due to the fact that the estimate is
part of a tendering process, and the vendor is anxious for the
business. It is also due to the fact that software development
is typically done by small, cash-poor organizations who are in
a weak position when bargaining with customers. And it is due
in part to the usual genuine optimism experienced by business
people at the outset of a new business relationship.
<P>
It should be immediately obvious that this system of pricing provides
false comfort to both sides. The customer believes that he is
going to pay a price close to the estimated price for the system
he wants. The vendor believes that he will be paid according to
output, and that output is a reasonable indicator of costs. The
customer's belief is false because the system he wants by the
time he has learned about software is unlikely to be the system
he thought he wanted when the contract was signed. The vendor's
belief is false because the physical size Of the resulting programs,
whether measured in lines of code or in constituent modules, bears almost no relationship to the costs of developing them. Some of that code, or some of those modules, will be standard
subroutines, others will have required enormous numbers of man-hours
to develop. Further, even if the increase in scope does result
in a matching increase in chargeable deliverables, the vendor
then has to deal with a very unhappy customer who has found that
the original estimate bears no relationship to the final cost.
<P>
Further difficulties are caused by the usual method payment. As
a software development project typically takes several months
to complete (even if all goes well), and as the vendor is unlikely
to have large financial resources from which the deve lopment
can be funded, progress payments are commonly provided for in
the contract. Although these payments should ideally be tied to
deliveries (see the discussion below), so that the customer gets
something of value with each payment, this is not easy to do.
In the first part of the development, the design stages, a great
deal of time is put in by the vendor's personnel, but very little
of actual value to the customer is produced. If the contract were
terminated for any reason during this stage, a new vendor would
have been saved some work, but the hours saved would be small
compared to the hours already spent by the first vendor. The new
vendor would still have to go through the process of learning
about the client's business. Also, no two software houses tackle
systems development in exactly the same way, so the first vendor's
work would be of limited value to the second.
<P>
From what has already been said, the reader should not be surprised
to learn that bankruptcy and other business termination is common
amongst software developers. It should also be obvious that such
a business failure in the middle of the development  process is
likely to be very expensive for the customer, and could have a
disastrous effect on the customer's business. Even after the development
is completed, the business failure of the vendor can have serious
results if the customer depends on the vendor for software maintenance.
<P>
Over-optimism about the scope of the project is typically accompanied
by over-optimism about the time needed to complete the project.
 Late delivery may be very expensive to the customer. If the software
was required for a new computer system, that system must be ordered,
and a delivery date fixed, well in advance. The customer may therefore
find himself making large payments for hardware he cannot use.
If the software was required to enable the customer to expand
business or to take on new business,  delay in delivery will mean
loss of profits from lost business, or expenses in providing outside processing
in order to keep the new business.
<P>
When software is being developed for use on the customer's existing
system, it is usual for much of the machine time needed for the
development to be provided by the customer. If the scope of the
contract is greatly increased, this could result in excessive
demands on the customer's machine time, to the extent that normal
business is interfered with. If the development is being done
on the vendor's machine, or if machine time is being hired from
a third party, there could be a similar result. The increased
scope can also cause excessive demands on the time of the personnel
of both the customer and the vendor, interfering with business
and causing personnel dissatisfaction.
<P>
A general problem with contracts for the development of' anything,
including software, is that it is very difficult to define meaningful
quality standards for something before it comes into existence.
<P>
Other problems can arise with the staffing of the project by the
vendor. Because of the amount of learning that must go on, particularly
in the early stages of the development, it is highly desirable
that the same personnel be involved throughout the whole development
process. While it is not possible for the vendor to prevent its
employees from leaving, the customer should at least insist that
the vendor does not use outside contract staff, who often do such
work merely because they are between jobs.
<P>
Ownership of the software, and rights to use it, should be agreed
upon at the outset. The customer will generally prefer to have
the ownership of, and exclusive rights to, the system. On the
other hand, the vendor would like to be able to use the work done
if there is an opportunity to develop a similar system for another
customer. The vendor may even wish to sell the system as a standard
product if there is a market for it. This is particularly true
if the vendor has made little or no profit on the development
because of an increase in scope.
<P>
<h3><I>CONTENTS OF A SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACT</I></h3>
<P>
<h4><I>Structure of the contract</I></h4>
<P>
One way of dealing with some of the problems referred to above
is to split the development process into three stages, and have
a separate contract for each stage. These three stages are the
initial analysis, preparation of the detailed design, and programming
and installation.
<P>
<h4><I>Initial analysis</I></h4>
<P>
This has been traditionally done at no cost to the customer, as
part of the bidding process While this may appear to be favourable
to the customers it is generally not so. 'To perform an adequate
initial analysis, unless the vendor is already familiar with the
customer's business, takes time and money. A vendor who is not
sure of receiving any return for this time and expenditure will
naturally put the minimum of both into performing the analysis.
It would benefit both parties if the customer contracted with
one interested vendor for a more detailed initial analysis to
be performed. This analysis could then be used as the basis for
tenders by any vendor interested in bidding for the development
contract. A fixed price could be agreed to for this stage, as
it should not be difficult for an experienced vendor to estimate
the amount of time needed for such an analysis, and only an experienced
vendor should be hired to perform this task.
<P>
<h4><I>Preparation of the detailed design</I></h4>
<P>
This is the stage where the escalations of scope and cost usually
take place. A more thorough initial analysis should do something
to limit this, but it is almost impossible to prevent. This is
the most difficult stage to prepare an adequate contract for,
because it is almost impossible to provide specifications at the
outset for the final product. From the point of view or the vendor
this stage is best done on a time-and-materials basis, with regular
payments. This is unlikely to be acceptable  to the customer,
however . These issues are discussed in detail below.
<P>
<h4><i>Programming and installation</i></h4>
<P>
If the detailed design has been properly prepared the programming
should present few problems. One problem which can arise is that
the customer, if he has not understood the design properly, may
object that the software does not do what he hoped for when he
actually sees it running. Of course, if the design has not been
properly prepared, this is the stage when deficiencies become
evident. Once the programming is completed installation on  the
customer's equipment should not present serious problems unless
the equipment is faulty, or unless unexpected incompatibilities
between the software and the hardware show up. 'This is possible
with a new hardware system, when the software vendor may have
had inadequate technical and  insufficient test time.
<P>
<h4><i>Maintenance</i></h4>
<P>
 The relationship between the vendor and the customer rarely ends
With the development stages described so far. Even in the best
produced software bugs will show up from time to time, which require fixing.
It is much easier for the person who wrote the software to fix them
than to  give the job to an outsider. Therefore, there is usually a
fourth stage for  which a contract is required - the maintenance
stage!
<P>
 The vendor will usually agree to a warranty period after installation
 when maintenance is performed free of charge. This is the period
when bugs are most likely to turn up.  Thereafter, maintenance is
usually performed under a separate, renewable contract.
<P>
<h4><i>Scope</i></h4>
<P>
<h4><i>Initial analysis</i></h4>
<P>
 Defining the scope of the initial analysis phase should not be
difficult. The customer will have given the vendor a preliminary description
or requirements, technical details of the hardware system the software
is to be used on, and copies of any reports or other documents the
software is to produce. It will be necessary for  the vendor to perform some
further initial data gathering by observing the customer's operations
and interviewing key members of the customer's staff. The parties
should agree approximately how much time is necessary for this, and
the customer should name those of its employees who should be interviewed, and agree to make them available. The vendor will then analyse
this data, and prepare an outline design proposal. The customer may request that alternative design proposals are also prepared, so that a choice can be made between them, perhaps on the basis of tenders received for the next stage. A timetable for preparation of these proposals should be set out in the contract The contents of the
outline proposal should also be specified and should be adequate to allow another software vendor to bid realistically on the development of the detailed design.
<P>
<h4><I> Detailed design</I></h4>
<P>
 It is easy to state what the detain d design documents should
contain. It is not easy to define the amount of work required to produce those
documents, but this is what costs the money and tends to grow
beyond recognition.  It is necessary for the contract both to define
the work needed and to set out procedures for controlling the amount 
of  work performed.
<P>
The amount of work needed is best defined by breaking the development
process down into individual steps, and by making a good faith
attempt to estimate the time needed to complete each step in the
light of the outline design, with an agreed error margin. Control
procedures must include regular review and approval by the management
of both parties of the work done. This, in turn, requires that
those managements are properly educated about what it is that
they are reviewing. The vendor should insist that the customer's
management approves of the work done in each step, and that that
approval is documented. Work in excess of the agreed amount incurred
at the customer's request, or the necessity later to re-do work
previously approved by the customer, should involve additional
payment if the contract is for a fixed price. It is important
that the vendor makes the unsophisticated customer (in a data-processing
sense) understand that the successful development of the software
depends as much upon the customer as it does upon the vendor.
<P>
<h4><I>Programming and installation</I></h4>
<P>
0nce the detailed design has been prepared and approved, the vendor
should be able to estimate the amount of time needed to prepare
programs with reasonable accuracy. A fixed-price contract is therefore
feasible although it should provide for additional payments if
extra programming is required because of design changes requested
by the customer. It is harder to make such an estimate for installation,
because that can be affected by hardware problems beyond the software
vendor's control. The scope of the work can be defined, however,
by setting out the steps to be taken and giving an estimate of
the time required to complete those steps if no hardware problems
are encountered. Installation and testing also require a considerable
amount of cooperation by the customer, both in provision of machine
time and in personnel requirements. The expected extent of such
cooperation should be agreed beforehand so that, for example,
the installation does not prevent necessary day-to-day operation
of the equipment. Where the system is to replace an existing system,
the customer should be obliged to run the two systems in tandem
for a reasonable agreed period, so that a failure in the new system
while the initial bugs are being caught does not have disastrous
effects on the customer's business.
<P>
<h4><i>Payment</i></h4>
<P>
<h4><i>Initial analysis</i></h4>
<P>
As the scope of the initial analysis stage is accurately estimable,
it could be paid for either by a fixed price or on a time-and-materials
basis. Assuming that the scope is limited, and this is a matter
for agreement between the parties, payment can be made on delivery
of the outline design proposal.
<P>
<h4><i>Detailed design</i></h4>
<P>
The vendor would naturally prefer to have this stage done on a
time-and-materials basis so as to be protected against increases
in scope. The customer, just as naturally, prefers to have some
limit on the cost, and needs to know what the project is likely
to cost before embarking upon it. If some sort of fixed pricing
is to be used, it is important that both parties have some protection
<br>
To protect the vendor:
<br>
(a)The price should be payable in stages, preferably designed
so as to match the vendor's expenditure.
<br>
(b) The vendor should have a right to stop work if payment is
not made.
<br>
(c) If the scope of the contract is increased at the customer's
request, or because of some act or neglect on the part of the
customer, the price should be increased.
<P>
To protect the customer:
<br>
(a) Progress payments should, as far as possible, be tied to deliverable
products. Then, if the vendor goes out of business or the contract
is terminated before the development is complete, the customer
has something which can be used. Therefore, the specified deliverables
should be defined in such a way as to be as useful as possible
to the customer in the event of such a termination. This would
include adequate documentation, where applicable.
<br>
(b) The total interim progress payments should not exceed the
vendor's costs. A part of the payment, representing the vendor's
profit, should be held back until the system has passed all the
acceptance tests
<P>
<h4><I>Programming and installation</I></h4>
<P>
The scope of' the programming should be reasonably fixed once
the detailed design has been approved, and therefore is suitable
for a fixed-price contract. Again. there should be progress payments
if the process is likely to last more than a month, and these
payments should be tied to deliverables. This is easier to do
at this stage. The vendor should be protected against changes
 requested by the customer by a provision for increased payments.
As explained above, the installation stage provides more problems
for fixed pricing because of the possibility of delays which are
the fault of neither party. If the customer insists on some kind
of fixed price, there should be provision for increased payments
for extra work occasioned by hardware problems. Installation should
normally be completed in a relatively short time, so it is unlikely
that progress payments will be necessary.
<P>
<h4><I>Staffing and resources</I></h4>
<P>
<h4><I>Vendor</I></h4>
<P>
The success of the project depends upon the calibre of the personnel
staffing it. The customer should stipulate the qualifications
of the staff to be used, according to the various job categories
involved, i.e., systems analyst, programmer.
<P>
Success also depends to a great extent on having continuity of
staff throughout the project. The learning process cannot be adequately
repeated for a new staff member coming in halfway through, and
that person is therefore more likely to make errors. While employees
of the vendor cannot be forced to remain in their jobs, the vendor
can agree to use only full-time employees, rather than contract
staff who are more likely to leave at short notice.
<P>
The customer should provide some protection against the effects
of a business termination by the vendor during the course of the
contract by a requirement that the vendor personnel involved will
assist in the handover to a new developer. If the contract contains
a  provision preventing the parties from attempting to hire away
each other's employees (see below), that provision should not
apply in the event of a business termination by the vendor.
<P>
The vendor's personnel should undertake to keep confidential all
of the customer's business secrets which they may learn during
their work on the software system. They should also agree to comply
with all the customer's security provisions while working on the
customer's premises. Further, security measures to apply when they are working
on the customer's confidential information on the vendor's premises
should be provided. Alternatively, the vendor could give an undertaking
regarding these matters, provided that the vendor's employees
are subject to a suitable confidentiality agreement.
<P>
When the vendor's staff are working on the customer's premises
the law may require that there is suitable insurance against injury.
The responsibility for providing this insurance should be set
out in the contract.
<P>
When the contract requires the use of the vendor's resources such
as machine time, or the provision of supplies such as magnetic
media by the vendor, payment for these resources or supplies should
preferably be separate from the payment for the development work.
<P>
<h4><i>Customer</i></h4>
<P>
The customer must agree to give the vendor full assistance by
properly qualified employees. A project manager, whose qualifications
have been approved by the vendor, should be named in the contract,
and the customer should agree not to remove that person from the
post except for reasons of unsatisfactory performance.
<p>
There should be a mutual undertaking not to offer employment to each other's
employees. This is particularly important for the vendor to obtain,
as there is always a temptation to the customer to acquire competent
programming staff to maintain the software by making an attractive
offer to the people most concerned with the development of the
system.
<P>
When the contract provides for use of the customer's resources,
particularly machine time, there should be a limitation on the
amount of time used for the development. The customer should not
be obliged to supply resources to the extent that normal business
is interferred with.
<P>
<h4><i>Timetables</i></h4>
<P>
At each stage of the development, it is important to set out each
of the steps involved, and to provide a timetable for the performance
each of the parties. This will help to draw attention to delays
at an early stage, allowing the parties to correct the problem
where possible, or to negotiate a later delivery date. Where the
scope of any stage is increased at the request of the customer,
the vendor should have the right to adjust the timetable and the
delivery date accordingly.
<P>
<h4><i>Performance</i></h4>
<P>
It is almost impossible to provide meaningful performance standards
for the software before the completion of the detailed design
and even then it is not easy to give more than general standards
which are to be met.
<P>
It is possible , however, to monitor performance by adequate testing
procedures to be applied during the programming stage of the development.
The contract should set out the tests to be performed, the testing
schedule, and the responsibilities for providing test data and
for approving the results.
<P>
The initial level of testing is to determine whether each program
operates in accordance with the program specifications. The data
for this testing are usually provided by the vendor. The next
level of testing is to determine whether each program meets the
customer's requirements. The responsibility for producing the
data needed for this testing must be with the customer. Similarly,
the system as a whole must be tested for conformity with the customer's
requirements, again using data supplied by the customer. any extra
work or delay caused by any inadequacy of the customer-supplied
test data should be the subject of a contract adjustment, in price
or in delivery data, as appropriate. The final testing should
be with live data, to ensure that the system operates correctly
under normal conditions. At each stage, the customer should approve
the test results before further work on development of that program
proceeds.
<P>
<h4><I>Installation and acceptance</I></h4>
<P>
A clear timetable for the installation and acceptance testing
should be set out. The acceptance testing procedures should also
be set out. Acceptance should be defined to occur when the system
conforms to the established performance specifications for the
specified acceptance test, other-wise the vendor is at the mercy
of a customer who refuses to make the final payments until perfection
is achieved. This is a virtually impossible requirement in the
software field. Acceptance should trigger the final payment in
a fixed-price contract, and marks the beginning of any warranty
period.
<P>
<h3>PRECEDENTS</h3>
<P>
<h4><i>Payments</i></h4>
<P>
<h4><i>Progress payments</i></h4>
<P>
The Customer agrees that, at the completion of each stage listed
in schedule ___ to this Agreement it will pay to the Vendor the
percentage of the total contract price applicable to that stage,
less a retention of ____%. The percentages of the contract price
applicable to each stage are set forth in schedule ____ to this
Agreement. The balance shall be retained by the Customer until
final acceptance of the System. If this Agreement is terminated
by the Vendor, or by the Customer because of the Vendor's default,
prior to final acceptance of the System., the Customer shall be
entitled to retain said balances as liquidated damages for the
Vendor's breach. In any other event, the balances shall be paid
to the Vendor upon termination. The Customer shall not be obliged
to pay any such progress payment until it has received from the
Vendor a progress report signed by an officer of the Vendor, certifying
the completion of the relevant stage and describing the status
of progress towards completion of the remaining stages.
<P>
<h4><i>Increase in scope at customers request</i></h4>
<P>

signed by an officer of the Customer. The Vendor shall provide
an estimate of the additional expected cost of the modification
or addition. The Vendor shall not be obliged to perform any step
towards making the modifications or addition until the Customer
has agreed in writing to pay the estimated additional cost, or
such other amount as the parties may agree in writing should be
paid.

shall have the right to offer employment to all or any of the
Vendor's employees assigned to the performance of this Agreement,
notwithstanding any provisions in this Agreement or related agreements
to the contrary. The Vendor shall notify all such employees of
this provision and shall obtain agreement from each of them that,
if he or she declines such an offer, he or she will agree to work
for not more than 30 days for the Customer as an independent contractor
at the same rate of day as he or she was receiving immediately
before his or her employment by the Vendor was terminated, in
order to assist the transfer of the work under this Agreement
to a new vendor.
<P>
<h4><i>Confidentiality</i></h4>
<P>
The Vendor agrees to treat as confidential all information received
from the Customer which the Customer has indicated in writing
to be confidential. The Vendor agrees to disclose this information
only to those of its employees who need to know it for the performance
of this Agreement, and to ensure that each of those employees
has signed an agreement to keep such information confidential.
The Vendor further agrees that it and its employees will observe
all security  regulations in effect from time to time at the Customer's
premises, and will comply with the Customer's written security
procedures for confidential material. A copy of these procedures
is attached to this Agreement as Schedule ____ .
<P>

insurance upon request.
<P>
<h4><i>Limitation on usage of resources</i></h4>
<P>
The Customer agrees to make available to the Vendor full assistance
by the Customer's employees, provided, however, that if such assistance
shall seriously interfere with any employee's duties, the employees
of both parties in charge of the performance of this Agreement
shall agree upon a schedule for the availability to the Vendor
of that employee's time.
<P>
The Customer shall make available to the Vendor ___ hours of
machine time per month, at times to be mutually agreed at the
beginning of the month in question between such supervising employees.
If, in any month, the Vendor shall require more time than is specified
herein, the parties shall negotiate terms for the provision of
such time, which may include purchase of time from a third party,
or offsetting the sums due under this Agreement by ____ per hour
of extra time, less any allowance for machine time allotted but
not used in preceding months.
<P>
<h4><i>Testing</i></h4>
<P>
The following testing shall be carried out in accordance with
the timetables contained in Schedule ____ to this Agreement:
<P>

procedures set out in Schedule ____ to this Agreement are complete,
the Customer shall perform the acceptance tests described in Schedule
____ to the Agreement. Such tests shall be completed no later
than ____ days after the receipt of the notice of installation.
It is mutually agreed that as soon as the System performs in the
acceptance tests according to the specifications set out Schedule
____ the software shall be deemed to be accepted by the Customer.
If any acceptance test shall disclose deficiencies in the software,
the Vendor will correct such deficiencies within ____ days, and
the Customer shall thereafter have ____ days to retest the software.
<P>
<h4><i>Ownership</i></h4>
<P>
All original materials including but not limited to programs,
listings, print-outs, flow charts and documentation produced by
the Vendor under this Agreement shall belong exclusively to the
Customer. The Vendor hereby agrees to assign, and does assign,
all copyrights in these materials to the Customer. The Customer
agrees that it will, upon  written request from the Vendor, grant
the Vendor a non-exclusive licence to use the materials in connection
with work to be done by the Vendor for a third party, provided,

<h2>ANNUAL EXAMINATIONS, SPRING 1995<br>
BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS II<br>
EXAMINER: PROFESSOR MACINTOSH</h2>
</h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3></center>
(1)	The exam must be returned within 24 hours of being picked up (unless you have made
a special arrangement with Professor MacIntosh).<p>
(2) There is only one restriction on the materials you may use. Because not everyone can have access to library materials at the same time, I would prefer that you not use anything from the library collection. Previously taken photocopies do not violate this rule.<p>
(3) In accordance with the Faculty Council resolution of Oct. 6, 1993, you may consult with other students in the course of working out your answer. However, please note that this resolution also provides that &quot;the answer or answers returned by the students must be organized and written by that student alone&quot;.<p>
(4)	There are four questions. The marks are allocated as follows:<p>
Q1: 25%<br>
Q2: 25%<br>
Q3: 20%<br>
Q4: 30%<p>
(5) The word limit for the whole exam is 4000 words. You may allocate your 4000 words in any way you see fit as between the various questions.<p>
(6) Please make a word estimate for the entire exam and put this estimate on the front page of your exam answer. Anything written in excess of the word limit <b>will not be read</b>! Be forewarned that this penalty will be enforced with absolute strictness, in fairness to those students who make a conscientious effort to observe the word limit. In the past, I have downgraded at least one &quot;A&quot; paper to a &quot;C&quot; for significantly exceeding the word limit, and have downgraded many more a half or a whole grade.
<p>
Please note that all word estimates are carefully checked. Given
some complaints about uneven enforcement of the rule in the past,
I have decided (commencing this year) to hire a graduate student
to carefully check all work estimates. No prisoners will be taken.
<P>
(7) I would prefer that you type your examination answer. However,
this is not required. If you write your answer, <b>please</b>
make sure that it is legible, and written on <b>every other line</b>.
If you choose, you may submit a handwritten copy of your answer
and submit a typed copy within one week (or longer, if you have
made a special arrangement with me).
<P>
If you submit a handwritten copy and intend to replace this with
a typewritten copy, <b>please clearly indicate this on the top of
the handwritten copy</b>.
<P>
(8) I place a high premium on <b>organization and clarity</b>
Answers which have been well thought out in advance uniformly
score higher.
<P>
(9) Feel free to incorporate by reference anything that you say
in response to one question for the purposes of answering another
question.
<P>
(10) Note that &quot;OSA&quot; means the Ontario <cite>Securities
Act.</cite> &quot;OSC&quot; means the Ontario Securities Commission.
<P>
1. At a Canadian Bar Association seminar in Toronto, 5 lawyers
were having lunch together. These lawyers were all graduates of
the Faculty of Law, University of Toronto, and had all been good
friends in law school. Having all graduated from law school in
the mid-1980s and moved to different parts of the country, they
had mostly bought houses in the late 1980s, at a time when the
housing market was at its peak. They were all grousing about the
fact that house prices in many parts of Canada had fallen precipitously
in the past 3 years.
<P>
One of them, Marjorie Mayhem, suddenly came up with an interesting
idea. She noted that house prices in various parts of the country
are far from perfectly correlated. For example, while in 1990
house prices in Vancouver jumped about 20%, prices in Victoria
went up by only 10%. Prices in Toronto fell by about 10%, while
in Halifax the price of the average house was unchanged. She dimly
recalled from her days in Business Organizations II that a superior
risk/return tradeoff can be achieved when investments whose prices
are imperfectly correlated are pooled in a portfolio of assets.
Normally, home owners are poorly diversified, since they own but
one home. But what if an investment vehicle was set up to give
all of them the benefits of diversification resulting from holding
interests in a pool of homes?
<P>
After putting their heads together, they came up with and put
into effect the following scheme to spread the risks of home ownership
amongst themselves. The scheme is contractual in nature (and binds
heirs, executors, and assigns). Each of the 5 participants signed
a contract giving them both rights and obligations vis-a-vis the
other 4 participants. In particular, the contract created a &quot;virtual&quot;
corporation called House-Hold Inc. A virtual corporation is an
imaginary corporation that does not in fact exist. Under the contract,
all 5 of the lawyers notionally &quot;sold&quot; their houses
to House-Hold, at current market values (set by an independent
appraiser). In return, they received notional (or imaginary) shares
of House-Hold, in proportion to the value of the house notionally
sold to House-Hold.
<P>
The following indicates the appraised values of each of their
homes in 1991, at the appraisal date, and the number of &quot;shares&quot;
in House-Hold each received.
<P>
<center><table>
<tr><th> Name</th><th> Value of House</th><th> % of Shares Received</th></tr>
<tr><td> David Dies-in-house</td><td> $2,000,000</td><td> 50%</td></tr>
<tr><td> David Bleaty</td><td> $ 400,000 </td><td>10%</td></tr>
<tr><td> Marjorie Mayhem</td><td> $ 600,000</td><td> 15%</td></tr>
<tr><td> Heironymous Borscht</td><td> $ 500,000</td><td> 12.5%</td></tr>
<tr><td> Wendy Wailer</td><td> $ 500,000</td><td> 12.5%</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>$4,000.000</td></tr>
</table></center><P>
Under the contract, if the owner of the house wanted to sell her/his
house, she/he would have to apply to a notional &quot;board of
directors&quot; for permission to do so. The board of directors
consisted of all 5 participants in the scheme. The board would
have to approve the sale price. In addition, if the participant
wanted to purchase another house and &quot;sell&quot; it to House-Hold,
the board was required to approve this purchase. These measures
were designed to ensure that all sales and purchases of houses
were prudent and at proper market prices.
<P>
If a house was sold, then the actual proceeds would of course
go to the owner. However, under the scheme, the proceeds would
notionally be paid to House-Hold. Then, the owner could force
the (imaginary) company to redeem all of her/his (imaginary) shares.
The value paid for the shares would be equal to the fraction of
the total number of shares held by the redeeming owner, times
the total (notional) value of the assets owned by House-Hold.
For example, if Jane held 20 of 100 notional shares of House-Hold,
and the total notional value of the assets of House-Hold (including
the proceeds from sale of her house) was $1,000,000, then her
shares would be (notionally) redeemed for 20/100 X $1,000,000,
or $200,000 (the &quot;redemption amount&quot;).
<P>
If the price at which the house actually sold was greater than
the redemption amount, the house seller would have to pay the
other house owners the difference between the sale price and the
redemption amount (in proportions corresponding to the shares
held by each owner). If it was less then the other owners would
have to pay the house seller the difference.
<P>
You may assume, if you think it important, that the above contractual
scheme did not in any way affect each owner's &quot;principal
residence&quot; exemption from capital gains tax (i.e. there were
no adverse tax consequences).
<P>
True to his name, one morning David Dies-in-house was found dead
in his house. Following instructions in the will, the executor
of his estate sold the house. The proceeds were $4 million. Since
none of the other house prices had changed at all, this means
that under the contract, the executor became obliged to pay $1,000,000
to the other participants. Note that while the executor failed
to seek the approval of the board of House-Hold to sell the house,
the board nonetheless met and approved the sale.
<P>
The executor has refused to pay. He has been heard to mumble something
about noncompliance with the Ontario <cite>Securities Act</cite>. The
other 4 participants have now come to see you, a crack Business
Organizations II student, for legal advice. Given your qualifications,
the Law Society has passed a special rule permitting you to dispense
the required advice. Please discuss any securities regulatory
issues you think this fact situation reasonably raises (with a
view to determining if the executor will have to pay up).
<P>
2. Daneco is a small firm incorporated under the OBCA. It is listed
on the Alberta Stock Exchange (&quot;ASE&quot;), and makes gidgets.
A gidget is a form of wanger which is instrumental in the manufacture
of plantagenets. Daneco is located in Edmonton, Alberta, and about
90% of its shareholders are in Alberta. About 5 % of its shareholders
are in Ontario. It has only one class of shares. which are not
&quot;legal for life&quot;.
<P>
Daneco decided to raise money by selling more shares, of the same
type which already trade publicly over the ASE, in a private placement.
In particular, it sold shares to a number of banks and insurance
companies under the Alberta equivalent of OSA s.72(1)(a). The
sales took place on March 1, 1995. You may assume for purposes
of this question that the Alberta <cite>Securities Act</cite> is identical
to the OSA.
<P>
The OSC has just discovered that a person resident in Ontario
bought a large block of shares in Daneco (15% of the equity),
through the facilities of the ASE. The transaction was negotiated
by a resident of Ontario through the Calgary office of a large
investment bank which has offices in every major Canadian city.
The seller was one of the banks that purchased shares from Daneco
in the aforementioned private placement on March 1.
<P>
(i) What concerns, if any, do you think the OSC might have about
this transaction?
<P>
(ii) What if the bank bought the shares from Daneco on March 1,
1994 (rather than 1995), sold them in a private placement to another
bank on Sept. 1, 1995, which in turn sold them over the ASE to
the Ontario resident? Would this make any difference?
<P>
(iii) If the OSC has some concerns about either variation of the
above transaction (i.e. the March 1 1995 version or the March
1. 1994 version) what can they do about it?
<P>
(iv) From a policy point of view, <b>should</b> the OSC be concerned
about either of these transactions? Would YOU recommend any changes
to the OSA?
<P>
3. Dane Gelder Inc. is a small firm incorporated under the CBCA.
It makes feltonbucklers. A feltonbuckler is a form of stem-bolt
which is instrumental in the manufacture of gidgets. Mulct, the
entrepreneur who originally incorporated Dane Gelder, is its largest
shareholder, holding 18% of the voting equity (there are 46 other
shareholders, other than employees and former employees who hold
shares). When he incorporated Dane Gelder, he hired Burne as the
firm's lawyer. Burne advised him he could buy his shares under
s.73(1)(a) and s.35(2)10 of the OSA, without the firm having to
issue a prospectus. The shares were then issued to Mulct.
<P>
Dane Gelder has 50 employees, all of whom are shareholders. 20
former employees are also shareholders. Mulct, the President of
Dane Gelder, was anxious to set up an employee share ownership
plan, and asked Burne if this was possible. Unfortunately for
Mulct (but particularly for Burne), Burne died before he could
return the call. The file was taken over by Bootstrap, an ambitious
junior in Burne's (former) firm. Bootstrap advised Mulct that
sales could be effected to employees, without the company having
to issue a prospectus, through s.72(1)(n) of the OSA.
<P>
Mulct, who wanted to ensure that all employees had a direct interest
in the business, sent a memo all employees indicating that, while
a purchase of shares was not required, preference in future promotion
decisions would be given to those who owned shares in the company.
About three-quarters of the employees joined the share ownership
plan, under which part of their monthly pay cheques go toward
the purchase of shares.
<P>
Mulct decided that he didn't like being the only director. He
asked four prominent business people (2 of whom he knew quite
well from prior business dealings, and two of whom he knew by
reputation only) to join the board. They all accepted. Mulct required
all of the new directors to purchase shares in the firm. On Bootstrap's
advice, the four new members of the board of directors purchased
shares under OSA s.72(1)(p). Between them, they now own 18% of
Dane (&gt;Gelder
<P>
The Articles of Incorporation of Dane Gelder state that the company
shall have no more than 50 shareholders, exclusive of present
and former employees. The articles also provide that the directors
may refuse to register a transfer of shares by any shareholder
indebted to the company, and that the company shall not offer
its shares to the public.
<P>
(i) What resale restrictions, if any, attach to the shares of
the various different shareholders?
<P>
(ii) After Dane Gelder sold shares to its directors, was it still
a private company?
<P>
(iii) Suppose that (on Bootstrap's advice, after the sale of shares
to the directors) Dane Gelder revises its Articles of Incorporation
to delete the provision restricting the number of shareholders
to 50 (exclusive of employees), as well as the limitation on offering
its shares to the public. Does Dane Gelder now have to comply
with the continuous disclosure obligation in OSA s.75?
<P>
(iv) Once the revisions to the Articles noted in (iii) occur,
what are the resale restrictions that attach to the shares of
the various shareholders?
<P>
(v) Who is the better lawyer? Burne (as he then was), or Bootstrap?
<P>
4. Target Inc. is an OBCA corporation that trades on the TSE,
and a majority of whose shareholders are resident in Ontario.
On the morning of Monday, Jan. 2, 1995, the market price for Target
was $10 per share.
<P>
Between 9:30 A.M. and 12:00 noon, T. Bone Chickens, a well known
corporate &quot;raider&quot;, acquired 10% of the voting equity
of Target. The shares were purchased from a variety of different
sellers through the facilities of the TSE, at prices ranging from
$10 to $10.50 per share. When news of the trading activity in
Target started to leak into the market, the price started to slowly
rise, on speculation that a takeover bid might soon occur. By
the afternoon, the market price was $11.
<P>
On the morning of Tuesday, Jan. 3, T. Bone acquired a further
5 % of Target, again over the TSE. He paid between $11 and $11.50
to effect the purchase, again from a variety of sellers. By the
morning of Wednesday, Jan. 4, further speculation about a possible
takeover bid drove the price of Target to $12. It stayed at $12
until Feb. 1.
<P>
On the morning of Feb. 1, T. Bone acquired a further 10% block
of Target, this time from an individual named Wally Schleper (who
retained 5 % of Target). The block was purchased at a price of
$13.80. News of the block trade leaked into the market; while
no one knew who purchased the block, the fact that a large block
of shares had traded hands further fueled takeover speculation,
and on the afternoon of Feb. 1, the market price rose to $13.50.
<P>
On April 2, T. Bone purchased a further 5 % of the shares of Target
at $13.50, through the facilities of the TSE.
<P>
Please identify and discuss any securities regulatory issues (including
policy issues) you think are raised by this fact situation.

<b>Question #1 (30 marks)</b>
<P>
You have been retained by David Cowan (&quot;Cowan&quot;) to advise
him with regard to a possible appeal of a decision of Oliver,
J., of the Ontario Court (GENERAL Division), released three (3)
days ago. Cowan is unhappy with the result and has retained you
after firing his previous counsel.
<P>
Cowan resides in British Columbia and was sued in Ontario by a
former friend, Jack O'Neil (&quot;O'Neil&quot;), with whom Cowan
was in partnership. The partnership carried on business solely
in British Columbia. The partnership ceased to carry on business
in May of 1992 when Cowan found out that O'Neil had been taking
money out of the partnership for his own personal use. The partnership
was in the business of manufacturing ski waxes which were distributed
solely in British Columbia.
<P>
Beginning in June of 1992, Cowan started a new business on his
own, manufacturing ski waxes, after finding out about his partner's
improper activities.
<P>
Cowan commenced a civil action in British Columbia in 1992 against
O'Neil for a declaration that the partnership was dissolved and
for damages suffered based on the monies which O'Neil had improperly
taken out of the partnership. O'Neil defended the B.C. action.
The British Columbia Supreme Court gave judgment to Cowan for
the sum of $150,000 against O'Neil and granted the declaration
that the partnership was dissolved. O'Neil did not appeal the
British Columbia decision and instead commenced the Ontario action.
(Action No. 236/95).
<P>
Cowan was served with the Statement of Claim in the Ontario action
in British Columbia. O'Neil has sued Cowan for improperly dissolving
the partnership; for breach of the partnership agreement; and
for breach of fiduciary duties for commencing a new business and
soliciting the partnership's customers. Cowan instructed his former
solicitors to bring a motion to set aside the service of the Statement
of Claim on him, and to strike out the Statement of Claim as disclosing no reasonable
cause of action. Oliver J. dismissed Cowan's motion giving the
following reasons:
<blockquote>
&quot;In my view Mr. O'Neil, as a resident of Ontario, has arguably
suffered damage in Ontario and can therefore bring this action
in Ontario. Further I am not satisfied that the Statement of Claim
does not disclose a cause of action &quot;
</blockquote>
Please advise Cowan as to what steps can be taken to overturn
the Oliver J. decision. In your advice, address whether the Oliver
J. decision is an interlocutory or final order and whether leave
to appeal is necessary. Refer to the appropriate rules in the
<cite>Rules of Civil Procedure. </cite>If you determine that leave to
appeal is necessary, draft the factum in support of the motion
for leave to appeal. If you conclude that leave is not necessary,
draft the factum for the appeal.
<P>
<b>Question #2 (30 marks)</b>
<P>
You have been retailed by Dr. Sam Collins, a medical doctor on
a matter concerning the revocation of his certificate of registration
allowing him to practise medicine in Ontario. A panel of the Discipline
Committee of the College of Physicians and Surgeons found Dr.
Collins to be incompetent under section 52 of the <cite>Health Professions
Procedural Code. </cite>The nature of the complaints made against
Dr. Collins were that he had prescribed the wrong drugs for patients;
that he had misdiagnosed several patients' problems and that he
had failed to properly treat several patients.
<P>
Dr. Collins was unrepresented by legal counsel at the hearing.
In the middle of the hearing he requested that the panel adjourn
the hearing to allow him to retain a lawyer, but this request
was denied. He has a number of other concerns regarding
the conduct of the hearing. Dr. Collins was not given the names
of the witnesses or a summary of their evidence prior to the hearing.
The panel was composed of three persons, one of whom participated
in a previous investigation concerning complaints about Dr. Collins.
Dr. Collins also has heard that another panel member had made independent
enquiries of other physicians regarding Dr. Collins' abilities.
Dr. Collins has also told you that one of the panel members was
not present for part of the hearing.
<P>
Please advise Dr. Collins as to what steps can be taken to overturn
the Discipline Panel's decision and the revocation of his licence
to practise medicine. The relevant sections of the Regulated Health
Professions (Code) are set out below. Please draft the appropriate
document to challenge the decision, ie. Notice of Appeal or Notice
of Application for Judicial Review, whichever you determine is
appropriate.

<h3>QUESTION ONE:</h3>
<P>
1. Jill was one of 25 people who invested $200,000 in a development
offered by Blue Shores Inc. Blue Shores represented to her that
her investment would be a tax deduction under Flavelle's <cite>Property
Tax Deduction Act</cite>. She also was advised by her lawyers, Green
&amp; Green, that the investment would be a tax deduction after
they reviewed the plan offered by Blue Shores Inc.
<P>
Jill was recently informed by Revenue Flavelle that following
an internal interpretation of the <cite>Property Tax Deduction Act</cite>,
her investment is not eligible for a tax deduction. Jill believes
that she has been deceived by Blue Shores and offered negligent
advice by Green &amp; Green. She phoned Blue Shores to complain
about the matter only to find out that they have closed their
offices. Green &amp; Green has told her that their legal advice
was not negligent and that if there is a problem it must be with
either the information they received from Blue Shores or with
Revenue Flavelle's interpretation of the act.
<P>
Jack, a fellow investor in Blue Shores, has already commenced
proceedings against Blue Shores claiming a contractual violation
because of similar representations made to him about the tax deductions.
Some of the other investors relied upon the investment as a tax
deduction while others were not told by Blue Shores about its
tax implications and did not consider them.
<P>
Citizens for Fair Taxation is an interest group who wants to argue
that the <cite>Property Tax Deduction Act</cite> is unconstitutional
because it violates s.15 of the Charter by favouring the wealthy.
<P>
<b>This question has two parts. Part A is worth three quarters of
the question so you should spend about 45 minutes while Part B
is worth one quarter or 15 minutes. You can assume that the laws in Flavelle are the same as in Ontario</b>.
<P>
A. Jill has come to your law office seeking advice on how to proceed
with her dispute. She is concerned about the costs of litigation
but also believes that Blue Shores and Green &amp; Green should
not be able to get away with their behaviour. Outline her options
including the one that you think is best designed to secure speedy
and comprehensive justice in the circumstances.
<P>
B. You are clerking for a judge who wants a memorandum on whether
Citizens for Fair Taxation should in a separate action be granted
standing to challenge the constitutionality of the <cite>Property
Tax Deduction Act</cite>. The judge is also interested in any relevant
theories of the role of judging and litigation that may help inform
the decision whether to grant standing.
<P>
<h3>QUESTION TWO: </h3>
<P>
The administrator of the estate of Jane Doe comes to you for advice,
today, April 19, 1995. Jane Doe died on March 15, 1993 after a
lengthy illness, at the age of 16 (she was born March 1, 1977).
During the latter phases of her illness she was treated by Dr.
Sound. He had described a proposed course of treatment to Jane
and her parents, which he represented to be the very best available
treatment for Jane's condition. Based upon this representation
Jane and her parents agreed that Jane should undergo the proposed
treatment. At the time of her death, her parents assumed that
Jane had received the best treatment, and that her death was not
preventable.
<P>
However, a coroner's inquest was ordered, as concerns about the
appropriateness of the treatments Dr. Sound was prescribing had
been raised by other patients and their families. Upon receiving
notice of the inquest on March 20, 1993, Jane's parents began
to wonder whether the treatment prescribed by Dr. Sound may have
contributed to Jane's death, but they had such faith in the competence
of Dr. Sound that they quickly cast this possibility aside. The
coroner's report was released May 1, 1993. The coroner concluded
that the treatment administered to Jane was completely inappropriate
and that much better treatment alternatives existed which would
have prolonged her life substantially. The coroner concluded that
the treatment fell well below the standard of care expected of
a medical doctor.
<P>
<b>This question has three parts. Part A is worth half of the
question so you should spend about 30 minutes. Parts B and
C are each worth one quarter, so you should spend about 15 minutes
on each</b>.
<P>
A. The administrator of Jane's estate tells you that he would
like to sue Dr. Sound on behalf of Jane's estate and asks your
advice as to whether this is possible. In the course of your research
you ascertain that all claims arising out of negligence or malpractice
in respect of professional services rendered by a medical doctor
must be brought within two years from the date the person bringing
the claim knew or ought to have known of the facts upon which
she or he alleges negligence or malpractice. (This provision is
not the actual provision, but is the one which you should use
for the purposes of answering this question.) You should also
consult the <cite>Limitations Act</cite> and the <cite>Trustee Act</cite>,
which are included in the materials.
<P>
B. Assume that the matter is proceeding and you have just received
the Affidavit of Documents of Dr. Sound. In the Affidavit he lists
only documents relating to Jane's care that pre-dated the coroner's
inquest as documents that he is prepared to produce. He lists
two other documents which were prepared for the coroner's inquest
and claims privilege for these documents. He further includes
a boilerplate, claiming privilege for all documents prepared in
contemplation of litigation. The affidavit has been certified
by his lawyer. You are dissatisfied with this affidavit, in part
because based upon information from your client you believe that
the doctor has in his possession other relevant, non-privileged
documents. How would you go about challenging the Affidavit to
obtain better disclosure and/or production and what arguments
would you make, (including what arguments would you make regarding
the appropriate cost award).
<P>
C. Two weeks prior to trial your office is served with an offer
to settle made by the defendant, Dr. Sound. He offers to settle
the claim for $20,000.00, with each party to bear their respective
legal costs. In the Statement of Claim, you had claimed $50,000.00
in damages, plus costs on a solicitor and client basis. Discuss
with your client the potential implications of having received
this offer to settle.
<P>
<h3>QUESTION THREE: </h3><b> Answer either
part A OR part B</b>.
<P>
A. The University of Toronto has recently adopted a Statement
on Prohibited Discrimination and Discriminatory Harassment. Currently
each Faculty and Department is being asked to design procedures
for the resolution, at the Faculty or Departmental level, of complaints
based upon discrimination or harassment on the basis of race,
ancestry, place of origin, ethnic origin, citizenship, color or
creed. Prepare a letter of advice for the Faculty of Law, setting
out pertinent issues which the Faculty ought to consider as it
develops its procedures.
<P>
<h3>OR</h3>
<p>
B. One of the most pressing issues currently facing the legal
profession in Canada is that of the scope of its responsibility
(or more accurately, the responsibility of its members) to make
legal services available. Many members of the public have complained
(and continue to complain) that they do not have access to legal
representation, let alone to <b>effective</b> legal representation.
For many, both within and outside the profession, both the monopoly
which the profession currently enjoys and its self-regulatory
status are deeply implicated in this debate. Discuss the scope
of responsibility which lawyers ought to have for the provision
of legal services, and in so doing, address whether the legal
profession ought to enjoy a monopoly and self-regulatory status.

</blockquote><p>
You are a lawyer practicing as an associate with a law firm in
Wrightsville, a city in Flavelle. From time to time, partners
send you memoranda asking for your help in client matters they
are handling. Set out below are three such memoranda about an
ongoing lawsuit, sent on the dates indicated.
<P>
Respond to each memorandum, complete with your reasoning and reference
to relevant authorities.
<P>
April 4, 1994. <cite>Re: Reprodex; suit by IBM</cite>. Frank Abel was
in to see me late yesterday. He is the president and major shareholder
of Reprodex Limited, a company I incorporated for him in the early
1980s. Reprodex is very big in the design and manufacture of components
for computers which it supplies to computer manufacturers all
over the world.
<P>
Abel was served with two copies of a Flavelle Court of Justice
statement of claim hours before my interview with him. He had
just returned the previous evening from a four-month business
swing through Europe. He has retained our firm to do what is necessary
to defend the action. Please write a memorandum for me, analyzing
everything that reasonably may support procedural defences at
this point. Also give me your assessment of the chances of success
on each defence you discuss.
<P>
Here is what Abel has told me.
<P>
In 1985, Reprodex entered into a contract with Intercontinental
Business Machines Ltd. (IBM), one of North America's biggest computer
manufacturers, to supply a disc drive built according to IBM's
stated specifications for a new, ultra-high-speed computer IBM
was developing. Abel and Leonard Broder, the head of IBM, had
been friends and business associates in the early days of the
industry in Canada, and because of that, Broder had tried to help
Reprodex ever since the company started up. When Reprodex delivered
the first shipment of the disc drives to IBM in mid-April 1986,
IBM immediately installed them and put the computers on the market.
Unfortunately, disaster struck eighteen months later: the computers
began to malfunction. Under a very generous consumer warranty,
IBM was obliged to service the machines free of charge for the
many purchasers who made claim. Worse, many purchasers returned
their computers under the warranty for full refund. IBM's engineers
immediately pinpointed the trouble in the Reprodex disc drive.
IBM thereupon demanded compensation from Reprodex for breach of
contract. During the lengthy negotiations between IBM and Reprodex,
Abel and Broder exchanged some pretty nasty language, and on one
of the occasions (I think Abel said it was some time in l991)
Broder retaliated by punching Abel in the face. Abel laid an assault
charge in Flavelle Provincial Court and Broder ended up paying
a $500 fine after conviction.
<P>
IBM issued the statement of claim in September, 1993. IBM sues
Reprodex for $1,500,000 for breach of contract to supply the disc
drive according to specifications and $500,000 allegedly owing
on a demand promisory note Reprodex executed as security for $500,000
IBM advanced to Reprodex ten years ago. Abel is joined as party
defendant on the promisory note claim as the alleged co-signer
and guarantor of the note.
<P>
<center><b>II</b></center>
<P>
June 6, 1994. <cite>Re: Reprodex: suit by IBM</cite>. Right now I am
drafting the defence in this action, and I attach to this memo
a copy of the version I have just finished writing up. [See the
end of this part.] What do you think of it?
<P>
I also have some other thoughts about how to proceed, and I would
like your opinion about what I have in mind. I am planning to
add a counterclaim by Abel against IBM and Broder for Abel's personal
injury caused by Broder's punch during that negotiation session.
If the fact of the punch is denied (or at least is not admitted)
in the defence to counterclaim, I think I will plead the criminal
conviction in the reply to defence to counterclaim in support
of a bar against Broder contesting the matter in these proceedings.
<P>
[The body of the attached document, without titles and such, reads
this way:]
<P><blockquote>
1. Defendants admit the following allegations in the statement
of claim -- that the corporate defendant was incorporated under
the laws of Flavelle and carries on business in Canada and internationally,
that defendant Abel is the president of the corporate defendant,
and that the corporate defendant entered into the contract to
supply the disc drive to the plaintiff.
<P>
2. Defendants deny all other allegations in the statement of claim
and put the plaintiff to the strict proof thereof.
<P>
3. Defendants particularly deny the allegations in paragraph 9
of the statement of claim that, as security for a $500,000 loan
from plaintiff to the corporate defendant, they and each of them
on May 3rd, 1984, signed a promisory note under which they and
each of them promised to pay on demand to plaintiff $500.000.
<P>
4. Defendants therefore ask that the court dismiss the claims
with costs.
</blockquote><P>
<center><b>III</b></center>
<P>
April 19, 1995. <cite>Re: Reprodex: suit by IBM</cite>. Please let me
have a memorandum giving your opinion of my chances of success
on the two motions I discuss below.
<P>
The oral examinations for discovery were held last week. I refused
to let Abel answer two of the questions he was asked:
<P><blockquote>
102. How many computers that IBM manufactured containing the Reprodex
disc drive have purchasers returned for refund of purchase price?
<P>
226. Tell me the names of the persons who were responsible for
developing the disc drive Reprodex was supplying to IBM under
the contract.
</blockquote><P>
Plaintiff's counsel has launched a motion to compel Abel's answer
to these questions.
<P>
Plaintiff's counsel also wants discovery of documents beyond what
we have given already. He wants us to produce and show to him
every document in the possession of Reprodex and this law firm
relating to the design, development and manufacture of the disc
drive from the time it was first conceived until the beginning
of this lawsuit. When I refused this request, he launched a motion
to compel production and allow inspection.

<P>
1. Commenting on the first two fully contested merger cases under
the <cite>Competition Act, Hillsdown Holdings (Canada)Inc. </cite>and
<cite>Southarn, Inc., </cite>an observer has stated:
<blockquote>
The starting point in merger cases is the identification of the
relevant product and geographic markets. In both cases the Tribunal
focused on the real-world behaviour of consumers and competitors
rather than theoretical or statistical economic evidence. Regrettably,
in <cite>Southam </cite>this degenerated into a 185 page review of highly
particularized evidence. If this bent for detail continues the
Tribunal risks missing the forest for the trees.
</blockquote>
Comment
<P>
2. It is inconsistent, some commentators claim, for a statute
aimed at maintaining and promoting competition to prohibit price
discrimination, predatory pricing and resale price maintenance.
<p>
Do you agree?
<P>
3. The Flavelle Law Association is an organization to which most
of the lawyers in the Judicial District of Flavelle (formerly
known as the County of Flavelle) belong. Like such organizations
throughout the Province, it provides a forum for discussion of
problems of common concern, acts as an occasional lobby and pressure
group, and has an active social program. With the help of the
Law Society it maintains a basic law library. The Judicial District
consists of the City of Flavelle (pop. 348,786) and its suburban
and rural environs.
<P>
In the past few years the Association has had a number of debates
on the future of legal practice in the District. Concern has been
expressed over the number of lawyers entering practice generally,
and the number entering practice in the Flavelle District in particular.
One school of thought is that the competition among members is
becoming &quot;cut throat&quot; and that the public is suffering
thereby. &quot;For example&quot; declaimed Art Park of Park &amp;
Ryde, a firm that devotes a large proportion of its time to estate
planning, &quot;Ann Abolic and Gerry Mander are advertising their
fee schedules, including a fee for a simple will, and an hourly
rate for the preparation of a plan. You and I know that they are
too young to have experience and judgment in estate planning,
and you just have to look at their fees to realize they must be
giving inadequate service or operating at a loss - perhaps both.&quot;
&quot;And the way some of them conduct litigation&quot; added
Titus Attik, of Attik &amp; Sellar, who specialize in civil litigation.
&quot;You'd think every preliminary and interlocutory motion provided
for in the rules was a compulsory element of every- legal dispute.
They must be running up huge bills of costs.&quot; The result
of several months deliberations by a committee was a Code of Professional
Behaviour to be approved by the Association and accepted by new members at time of joining the Association. Observance
was to be voluntary with the only sanction for breach of any of
the provisions being publication of the names of &quot;non-observers&quot;
with the particular form of non-observance in a monthly Newsletter.
One of the provisions reads: &quot;Advertising professional services
is inconsistent with the dignity of the profession and likely
to damage its reputation and the reputations of its members.&quot;
<P>
The executives have consulted you to determine the propriety of
such an undertaking. Advise.
<P>
4. The City of Emsworth has a population of 3.2 million and six
daily national newspapers. There are three &quot;quality&quot;
papers publishing news of international and national events and
commenting significantly on issues of importance. The Globe and
the World have circulations over 750,000 daily while the Planet
has 400,000. The three &quot;tabloids&quot; provide sketchy news
coverage but concentrate on features such as sports, gossip, and
opinionated exchanges on the &quot;letters&quot; page. The Comet
and the Meteor sell close to 2 million copies daily, while the
Asteroid manages just over 1,000,000. The Globe, the Planet and
the Meteor are all controlled by Market Blandings Inc., a conglomerate
with interests in many manufacturing, distributing, resource and
communication enterprises. The Planet was acquired recently when
it appeared to be in danger of becoming insolvent. As part of
a plan to &quot;rationalize&quot; its publications the management
of the press division positioned the Planet as a morning paper
and had the Globe begin to appear at noon. They began offering
joint subscriptions; for an additional 10 percent a subscriber
to either paper could receive both, or the Meteor. Advertising
rates offered similar bargains.
<P>
You have been consulted by Billy Club, a business columnist with
the World who doubts the economic rationale offered by Market
Blandings for its policy. He wonders whether the <cite>Competition
Act </cite>has any application to the circumstances. Can you assist?
<P>
 5. Write an essay on a topic of your choice.

<p>
Est and Casino are provinces in a federal country whose laws are
identical to those of Canada. Shortly after his Reactionary Renewal
Party is swept to power in the province of Est. Premier Bill Bagg
declares war on environmentalists who, he says, are destroying
the competitiveness of the province's industrial base. Pending
a comprehensive review, Bagg's government passes legislation that
returns the province's air and water pollution standards to what
they were before, as Bagg puts it, the province started to be
run by &quot;commies and Green Freaks&quot;. Greatly increased
amounts of toxic pollutants are soon detected in the air and in
rivers and lakes in the adjoining province of Casino. Casino's
Premier, Cam Naptha, who has a longstanding self-made reputation
as a supporter of environmental causes, tells Bagg: &quot;I don't
care whether you poison your own people but keep that filth out
of my province.&quot; Bagg replies that Est has the sovereign
right to set its own pollution standards free from outside interference.
<P>
Indignant, Naptha pushes through the legislature of Casino the
Transboundary Pollution Responsibility Act (TPRA). The Act has
the following main features: it affirms the jurisdiction of the
Casino courts to hear any matter arising out of pollution flowing
into Casino from other provinces; it establishes absolute liability
as the standard to be applied with respect to tortious liability
of out of province polluters; it provides for damages, including
punitive damages, as a remedy, as well as injunctive relief where
the court sees fit; it gives standing to environmental interest
groups to sue on behalf of the public interest, provided that
any monetary award is distributed through a Compensation Fund
to which anyone who has been injured due to the pollution in question
shall have access. The Act also establishes the Transboundary
Pollution Litigation Subsidy, to provide environmental groups
as well as individuals with legal services to pursue litigation
under the Act. Finally, the Act also contains what Naptha calls
a &quot;save the world&quot; clause. This clause 1) confers on
the Casino courts the jurisdiction to hear any matter connected
with any polluting act anywhere that is in violation of international
environmental law and legal norms; 2) establishes that the applicable
law in any such action shall be the law of C&gt;einn
<P>
In response to the Casino legislation, the government of Est passes
the Extraprovincial Measures Act. The Act prohibits the Est courts
from recognizing or enforcing any judgment pursuant to the Casino
Transboundary Pollution Responsibility Act. The Act also makes
it an offence to remove from the province any document or any
other matter that may be used in evidence in litigation pursuant
to the TPRA. Finally, the Act declares that the courts of Est
have exclusive jurisdiction over any private action based on polluting
acts that are alleged to have taken place entirely within the
territory of Est. and abolishes public interest standing in any
&quot;environmental cause.&quot;
<P>
<b>75%</b> 1. Cindy Braka and Norbert Wellman are fishers who make their
living on rivers and lakes in Casino. Pollution flowing out of
a chemical plant across the Est border has come close to destroying
their livelihood, and they are considering taking legal action
against the owners of that Plant, a major corporation that does
business in, and owns assets in, most provinces. One-World is
an environmental interest group operating in Est. that wishes
to get the Plant shut down given the risk it is creating for nearby
communities in Est. Based on the above facts, advise Braka, Wellman,
and One-World on the conflict of laws and related constitutional
issues that may arise in any such action.
<P>
<b>25%</b> 2. Based on your answer to 1, reflect briefly on the adequacy
of conflict of law rules, included related constitutional rules,
for managing the private law implications of interprovincial conflicts
of the kind described in this fact situation. Does the federal
government have a role to play, or are the courts better able
to sort matters out using judge-made (and sometimes constitutionally-based)
rules?

...There are two deep and central puzzles which confront Canadian
jurists as they struggle to make sense of <cite>Charter </cite>and its
meaning for Canadian legal and political culture. The puzzles,
although not identical, are closely interrelated. The first is
the recurring riddle which has haunted American constitutionalists
for the past 25 years. It arises from the apparent contradiction
between democratic values and the institution of judicial review.
Judicial review involves unelected judges overturning the will
of a democratically-accountable legislature on the basis of open-ended
and abstract constitutional guarantees. The interpretation and
application of those guarantees appears to invite the judiciary
to &quot;balance&quot; the interests of individuals against those
of the collectivity. The problem for American theorists has been
how to account for and justify this apparent derogation from democratic
principles. After all, courts are far less adept than legislatures
in striking the right balance between the interests of individuals
and the need for effective governmental programmes. Indeed, it
is precisely for this reason that Canadian courts have traditionally
resisted various invitations to engage in &quot;interest balancing&quot;.
The view of Canadian courts has been that interest balancing requires
choices &quot;which must, by their very nature, be arbitrary and
embody personal economic and social beliefs.&quot; (Dickson J.
[as he then was] in <cite>Harrison v. Carswell </cite>(1975), 62 D.L.R.
(3d) 68 at 92 (S.C.C.).
<P>
With the enactment of the <cite>Charter</cite>, Canadian lawyers and
judges will now have to grapple with this fundamental issue of
the legitimacy of judicial review. There is a second, related
problem arising from the introduction of the <cite>Charter</cite>in
Canada; in a sense, this second problem could be characterized
as nothing more than a particularized restatement of the first.
As the above passage from <cite>Harrison v. Carswell</cite> suggests,
one of the central components of Canada's legal creed has been
a belief in the continued viability of the distinction between
the realms of law and politics. The cornerstone of this creed
has been the legislative supremacy of Parliament, subject only
to federalism issues dealing with the proper allocation of power.
The role of the courts has been regarded as essentially subordinate;
the courts do not make political choices themselves, but merely
give effect to the political choices made by others. The <cite>Charter</cite> challenges the dominance of
<P>
this ruling paradigm. Under the <cite>Charter</cite>, courts are required
to balance interests, the very sort of reasoning which <cite>Harrison
v. Carswell</cite> declared off limits. Thus, the <cite>Charter</cite> appears
to reject all the established axioms about the nature of the judicial
role. It casts judges in the role of political actors rather than
neutral arbiters. As such, the potential impact of the <cite>Charter</cite> extends far beyond the particular field of constitutional
law. The <cite>Charter</cite> has the potential of revise the way we
view judges generally, across the whole spectrum of the legal
system....
<P>
Given the political character of constitutional adjudication under
the <cite>Charter</cite>, what are the values that should guide Canadian
judges as they give meanings to its open-ended provisions? This
... is the fundamental issue facing Canadian jurists as they attempt
to make sense of the <cite>Charter</cite>. ...

<P>
<h3>QUESTION 1</h3>
<P>
You are an Ottawa lawyer. Your clients, Todd Layland and Pierre
Beaulne, have cohabited in a homosexual relationship since August
1, 1991. They wish to marry one another.
<P>
On January 16, 1995, they attended at the office of the City Clerk,
City of Ottawa, and submitted a marriage licence application.
The marriage licence application is a form issued by the office
of the Registrar General for the Province of Ontario. On the form,
the applicants are asked to answer a number of questions about
their names, addresses, religious denomination, their marital
status, details of any divorce, and data relating to their parents.
There is nothing on the application referring to the sex of the
applicants, nor are there any words that prohibit same-sex marriages.
There are headings labeled &quot;Bride&quot; and &quot;Bridegroom&quot;.
Ms. Colette Latour, an employee of the City of Ottawa City Clerk's
Office, refused to accept your clients' marriage licence application.
In refusing their application, Ms. Latour stated that same-sex
marriages are not permitted by the <cite>Marriage Act</cite>, R.S.O
1990, c. M.3.
<P>
The <cite>Marriage Act</cite> makes no explicit reference to sexual
orientation in connection with marriages. The authority to marry
is set out in s. 4 as follows:
<blockquote>
4. No marriage may be solemnized except under the authority of
a licence issued in accordance with this Act.
</blockquote>
Section 5(1) sets out who can marry. It reads:
<blockquote>
5(1). Any person who is of the age of majority may obtain a licence,
provided no lawful cause exists to refuse to issue such a licence.
</blockquote>
It is common ground that there is no statutory provision that
defines marriage in a way that excludes the union of persons of
the same sex. Nonetheless, &quot;marriage&quot; at common law
consists only of the union of one man and one woman and cannot
include a homosexual union: see, for example, <cite>Hyde v. Hyde</cite>
(1866), L.R. 1 P. &amp; D. 130; <cite>Corbett v. Corbett (Ashley)</cite> (No. 2), [1970] 2 All E.R. 33 (P.D. &amp; A. Div.). The Oxford
English Dictionary also defines &quot;marriage&quot; as &quot;a
condition of man and woman legally united for purpose of living
together and usually procreating lawful offspring.&quot;
<P>
Prior to the enactment of the <cite>Charter</cite>, Canadian courts
relied on the above cases to hold that persons of the same sex
do not have the capacity to marry one another, and that, as a
result, &quot;lawful cause&quot; (within the meaning of s. 5(1)
of the <cite>Marriage Act</cite> and similar provisions in statutes
of other provinces) exists to refuse to issue a marriage licence
to same-sex couples. In <cite>North v. Matheson</cite> (1974), 53 D.L.R.
(3d) 280 (Man. Co. Ct.), Ormrod J. provided the following reasons
for this conclusion:
<blockquote>
[S]ex is clearly an essential element of the relationship called
marriage, because it is and always has been recognized as the union of a man and
woman. It is the institution on which the family is built, and
in which the capacity for natural heterosexual intercourse is
an essential element. It has, of course, many other characteristics,
of which companionship and mutual support is an important one,
but the characteristics which distinguish it from all other relationships
can only be met by two persons of opposite sex.
</blockquote>
You have applied for judicial review of the refusal by the City
Clerk's Of five to issue a marriage licence to your clients on
the basis that the refusal violates ss. 7 and 15, and cannot be
justified under s. 1, of the <cite>Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms</cite>. The Attorney General of Ontario opposes the application.
What is your constitutional argument? What constitutional arguments
of the Attorney General should you be concerned about? How will
you answer these opposing arguments?
<P>
<h3>QUESTION 2</h3>
<P>
In a recent Ontario election, a conservative party swept into
office proclaiming &quot;a common sense revolution&quot;. Part
of its platform proposes to &quot;get tough on crime and drugs&quot;.
To this end, the government has announced increased funding for
police patrols, drug testing for new public sector employees,
and introduced new legislation entitled, <cite>An Act regulating
Illicit Drug Equipment and Literature (&quot;IDEAL Act&quot;)</cite>.
<P>
The <cite>IDEAL Act</cite> regulates the sale of drug-related instruments
and drug-related paraphernalia in so-called head shops, and regulates
the sale of publications and literature glamorizing, advocating
and promoting the use of drugs. Its stated purpose is to protect
vulnerable children and youth and to reduce the influence of organized
crime involved in the distribution of illicit drugs.
<P>
It is clear from speeches given in the legislature that the Government
was concerned about the fact that vulnerable children and youth
were the recipients of a double message. On the one hand, the
consumption of illegal drugs is banned and subject to severe penalty
by federal law; on the other hand, drug paraphernalia shops freely
sell instruments to aid in drug consumption and literature that
promotes the consumption of illicit drugs. This dilemma was expressed
by Ontario Provincial Police Assistant Commissioner Rod T. Stamler,
who was a witness in legislative committee hearings. He stated:
<blockquote>
While organized crime groups are reaping massive profits from
the illegal drug trade, we continue to permit the public sale
of instruments and literature for drug use, which no doubt reinforces
the motives and incentives of crime organizations in responding
to the obvious demand for drug supplies. Parents are appalled
at the open sale and availability of &quot;how-to&quot; publications,
such as <cite>How to Grow Marijuana and Magic Mushrooms, Cocaine
Handbook, Tootin' Tips </cite>and <cite>Grow Yer Own Stone</cite>. The
same is true for the availability of monthly issues of <cite>High Times</cite> magazine, published in the United States, which promotes
and glamorizes the drug trade.
</blockquote>
Section 1 of the <cite>IDEAL Act</cite> states:
<blockquote>
&quot;equipment for illicit drug use&quot; means anything designed
primarily or intended under the circumstances for consuming or
to facilitate the consumption of an illicit drug.
<P>
&quot;Literature for illicit drug use&quot; means any printed
matter or video describing or depicting, and designed primarily
or intended under the circumstances to promote, encourage or advocate
the production, preparation or consumption of illicit drugs.
</blockquote>
Section 4 establishes an Illicit Drug Equipment and Literature
Board (&quot;IDEAL Board&quot;), and s. 5 provides:
<blockquote>
5. (1) No place of business shall offer for sale without lawful
excuse any equipment for illicit drug use or any literature for
illicit drug use which has not been approved by the IDEAL Board.
<p>
(2) Any one contravening subs. (1) is guilty of an offence
and liable on summary conviction:
<P>
(a) for a first offence to a fine of not less than $2000.00;
<P>
(b) for second or subsequent offence to a fine of not less
that $10,000 and not more than $40,000.
</blockquote>
Section 6 of the <cite>IDEAL Act</cite> provides:
<blockquote>
6. In determining whether to approve illicit drug equipment
and literature for sale, the IDEAL Board shall not withhold approval
of literature that contains depictions of drug use that are essential
to a wider artistic, literary, medical or scientific purpose.
</blockquote>
You are a lawyer at the Office of the Attorney General of Ontario.
The Attorney General has asked you to prepare a memorandum addressing
the constitutionality of the <cite>IDEAL Act</cite>. In particular,
she has asked you to address the following issues:
<P>
(i) Does the <cite>IDEAL Act</cite> infringe s. 2(b) and, if so,
can it be justified under s. 1, of the <cite>Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms</cite>? (Your answer to this issue will be worth
50% of Question 2.)
<P>
(ii) Does the Province of Ontario possess the legislative authority
under s. 92 of the <cite>Constitution Act, 1867</cite> to enact the
<cite>lDEAL Act</cite>? (Your answer to this issue will be worth 50%
of Question 2.)

primarily because of societal values associated with the propagation
of the human race. No same sex couple offers the possibility of
the birth of children by their union.
</blockquote>
You have commenced proceedings to challenge the refusal by the
City Clerk's Office to issue a marriage licence to your clients
on the basis that the refusal violates ss. 7 and 15, and cannot
be justified under s. 1, of the <cite>Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms</cite>. Your clients are prepared to take the case to
the Supreme Court of Canada, if necessary. The Attorney General
of Ontario opposes the application. What is your constitutional
argument? What constitutional arguments of the Attorney General
should you be concerned about? How will you answer these opposing
arguments? Are you likely to succeed?
<P>
The following information may prove helpful in structuring the
constitutional argument. Marriage is a status from which flow
many legal rights and obligations, including such things as sponsorship
in immigration law and medical decision-making powers if one spouse
becomes incapacitated. Denmark is the only country in the western
world to have essentially legalized same-sex marriage by creating
a new status of &quot;registered partnership&quot; open only to
same-sex couples and which carries almost all of the legal consequences
of marriage. Some countries are beginning, in a piecemeal fashion,
to recognize same-sex relationships as spousal relationships for
some purposes, just as the law recognizes unmarried heterosexual
couples as spouses for some purposes. In Ontario, a government
bill to accord same-sex couples the same rights and obligations
as heterosexual common-law couples was defeated in a free vote,
even after the government deleted provisions allowing same-sex
couples to adopt children, because of the perceived threat posed
to the traditional family.
<p>

The following information may be of use to you in preparing your
memorandum. Any publications which counsel the commission of a
drug-related offence and which pose an imminent threat of an offence
being committed can be prosecuted under the counselling offence
in the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>. Political advocacy groups such as
NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws)
have opposed the bill, as has the Writer's Guild.

All exam answer booklets are to be left on the writing table and will be collected by the invigilator.
<p>
7. Time limits will be enforced. Students who continue to write after the examination has ended will have their booklets collected separately and may be subjected to a penalty.
<p>
<b>Question One</b>
<p>
The government is considering prohibiting nudity in public entertainment, and it has retained you to give it some advice about freedom of expression.
<p>
During the past couple of years, an immense number of complaints have been made about nudity in public entertainment. Most of these complaints, by far, have been about nude dancing in taverns by females for male audiences, and some this dancing has involved intimate contact with members of the audience.
<p>
The essence of prohibition that the government is considering is that female entertainers must have an opaque covering over their breasts, and both male and female entertainers must have an opaque covering over their pubic areas. This requirement will apply to all places of entertainment, for example, theatres and taverns. The justifications are the need to preserve the family, and the need to prevent exploitation and debasement of women. Public opinion polls show that an overwhelming majority supports this prohibition.
<p>
The government has asked you whether this prohibition would violate the right to freedom of expression given by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and if it does, whether it could be justified under section one. In giving your opinion, assume that there is no other relevant legislation.
<p>
<b>Introduction to Questions Two and Three</b>
<p>
Questions two and three involve surrogate motherhood. These questions involve different issues than you considered in the Bridge, and you need not worry whether you can remember what you read there - or were supposed to have read.
<p>
Some explanation is needed, and this explanation can best begin with a description of the usual arrangement. Imagine that a married couple wishes to have a child; the male is fertile, but the female is not. They make a contract with another female - a relative, a friend, or a stranger, to be the surrogate mother. In return for payment, she will be inseminated with sperm from the male partner; she will carry the baby to term; and after its birth, the baby will become the child of the couple.
<p>
This usual arrangement can be varied. Some variations involve more complex technology, especially in vitro fertilization, a complex and uncertain process of taking a ovum from a female, fertilizing it with male sperm outside a womb, and returning it to the womb of the woman from whom the ovum came, or the womb of another woman. Other variations involve the prospective parents. Instead of a married couple, the parents might be an unmarried heterosexual couple, a homosexual couple, or a single person (and some of these variations of the prospective parents involve in vitro fertilization).
<p>
This process involves difficult moral questions; the experience may cause emotional difficulties for the participants; and formidable contract problems can arise if one of them changes her or his mind. Some women's groups are opposed to surrogate motherhood because it reinforces the stereotype of women as &quot;breeders,&quot; and because the surrogate mothers may be exploited.
<p>
The government is considering permitting surrogate motherhood, subject to very stringent restrictions about who could perform the procedures, the contract, the prospective parents, and the surrogate mothers. These restrictions would be supervised by an administrative agency, whose approval would be needed for every surrogate arrangement. Any contract for surrogate motherhood that was not approved would be void, and criminal-type sanctions would be imposed on persons who made arrangements intending to avoid the regulation (although on not the surrogate mother herself). The result of these restrictions would be that a large proportion of the arrangements now made would be prohibited.
<p>
<b>Question Two</b>
<p>
The government has asked you whether restrictions of this kind would violate section seven of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms; in particular, it has asked you to consider challenges by either of the prospective parents in the typical arrangement described in the introduction, by women who wish to be the surrogate mothers, and by the lawyers and doctors who have specialized in arranging these contracts and performing these procedures, and who will see their businesses either substantially curtailed or terminated. The government has not, though, asked you to consider whether a violation, if you think there is one, can be justified under section one, and it will not pay you any more if you do consider this possibility.
<p>
<b>Question Three</b>
<p>
The terms being considered stipulate that the prospective parents must be married. Heterosexual couples living in stable relationships but who are not married are excluded, and so are homosexual couples and single persons, no matter how well suited they may otherwise be to parenthood.
<p>
Your answers to the first two questions were so impressive that the government has asked you for advice one last time. It has asked you whether this requirement violates section 15(1) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and, if it does, whether any violations can be justified under section one.

<p>
<h3>QUESTION 1</h3>
<B>Value - 40%<br>
Time to Answer - 1 hour and 15 minutes</b>
<p>
The control of firearms is currently a very important issue on the public policy agenda because of fears about increased violent crime in Canada.
<p>
The federal government has introduced a bill to enact the <cite>Firearms Act</cite>, which will significantly tighten up the control of firearms by extending the existing registration system for handguns and prohibiting certain weapons. Specifically, it will:
<blockquote>
1. prohibit anyone from possessing a firearm (rifles as well as handguns) unless he/she has a Canadian Firearms License, which can only be obtained after the individual has passed an authorized firearms safety course and is 16 years of age;
<p>
2. require the registration of all firearms (rifles as well as handguns) by all firearms owners in Canada;
<p>
3. require registered handguns to remain at the place designated in the registration (e.g. the licensee's home) unless there is a license to transport the weapon for specified purposes (for example, to a gun club for target practice);
<p>
4. prohibit the importation or sale of certain types of weapons, such as handguns with a barrel length of less than 105 mm or assault rifles.
</blockquote>
Aboriginal persons are exempted from the licensing requirement in paragraph one, provided that they hunt or trap as a way of life in order to sustain n themselves or their  families.
<p>
The Act confers the power on the Cabinet to make detailed regulations to implement the Act. Possession of a gun without the necessary license and registration certificate or possession at an unauthorized place is an offense punishable by up to five years of imprisonment and forfeiture of the weapon.
<p>
The province of Ontario has also been concerned about an increase in violent crime. Believing that the federal legislation does not go far enough, the government recently introduced the <cite>Ammunition Sales Act</cite> bill. That Act will provide:
<blockquote>
1. No one can purchase ammunition in Ontario unless he or she has an Ontario Ammunition Permit. Such a permit is only available to those over 18 years of age who possess A va lid Canadian Firearms Licence;
<p>
2. Retailers of ammunition in the province must keep a record of every sale of ammunition that specifies the time of each transaction, the name, age and address of the purchaser and the Ontario Ammunition Permit number.
<p>
3. Retailers who contravene the Act can lose their retail license. Retailers, and others who contravene the Act, can be prosecuted and fined, on conviction, up to $25.000.
</blockquote>
Some members of the legislature want to make this Act tougher by controlling the import of ammunition from other provinces and the United States, and have suggested that a further section be added that will prohibit possession of ammunition in the province unless it has been purchased under an Ontario Ammunition Permit. Alternatively, they suggest an outright ban on the importation of ammunition.
<p>
The Canadian Rifle Association, a group opposed to further controls on gun and ammunition use, has been suggesting that the federal and provincial legislation are vulnerable on constitutional grounds under the <cite>Constitution Act, 1867</cite>. Representatives of Aboriginal peoples are also concerned about the implications of the Ontario bill.
<p>
Assume that you are a lawyer with the provincial Ministry of the Attorney General. You have been asked to give a reasoned legal opinion on the constitutional issues that might arise under the <cite>Constitution Act, 1867</cite> if both the federal and provincial laws were enacted (including the suggested amendment to the provincial law). Do not discuss the <cite>Charter of Rights</cite> or the <cite>Constitution Act, 1982</cite>, even if you think that issues under them might arise.
<p>
<h3>QUESTION 2</h3>
<B>Value - 35%<br>
Time to Answer - 60 minutes</b>
<p>
You are an Ottawa lawyer. Your clients, Todd Layland and Pierre Beaulne, have cohabited in a homosexual relationship since August 1, 1991. They wish to marry one another.
<p>
On January 16, 1995, they attended at the office of the City Clerk, City of Ottawa, and submitted a marriage license application. The marriage licence application is a form issued by the office of the Registrar General for the Province of Ontario. On the form, the applicants are asked to answer a number of questions about their names, addresses, religious denomination, their marital status, details of any divorce, and data relating to their parents. There is nothing on the application referring to the sex of the applicants, nor are there any words that prohibit same-sex marriages. There are headings labelled &quot;Bride&quot; and &quot;Bridegroom&quot;. Ms. Colette Latour, an employee of the City of Ottawa City Clerk's Office, refused to accept your clients' marriage license application. In refusing their application, Ms. Latour stated that same-sex marriages are not permitted by the <I>Marriage Act</i>, R.S.O 1990, c. M.3.
<p>
The <I>Marriage Act </I>makes no explicit reference to sexual orientation in connection with marriages. The authority to marry is set out in s. 4 as follows:
<blockquote>
4. No marriage may be solemnized except under the authority of a license issued in accordance with this Act.
</blockquote>
Section 5(1) sets out who can marry. It reads:
<blockquote>
5(1). Any person who is of the age of majority may obtain a license, provided no lawful cause exists to refuse to issue such a license.
</blockquote>
It is common ground that there is no statutory provision that defines marriage in a way that excludes the union of persons of the same sex. It is also common ground that the definition of &quot;marriage&quot; at common law consists only of the union of one man and one woman and cannot include a homosexual union. The Oxford English Dictionary also defines &quot;marriage&quot; as &quot;a condition of man and woman legally united for purpose of living together and usually procreating lawful offspring.&quot;
<p>
Prior to the enactment of the <I>Charter, </I>Canadian courts relied on the common law definition to hold that persons of the same sex do not have the capacity to marry one another, and that, as a result, &quot;lawful cause&quot; (within the meaning of s. 5(1) of the <I>Marriage Act </I>and similar provisions in statutes of other provinces) exists to refuse to issue a marriage licence to same-sex couples. In <I>North v. Matheson </I>(1974), 53 D.L.R. (3d) 280 (Man. Co. Ct.), Ormrod J. provided the following reasons for this conclusion:
<blockquote>
[S]ex is clearly an essential element of the relationship called marriage, because it is and always has been recognized as the union of a man and woman. It is the institution on which the family is built, and in which the capacity for natural heterosexual intercourse is an essential element. It has, of course, many other characteristics, of which companionship and mutual support is an important one, but the characteristics which distinguish it from all other relationships can only be met by two persons of opposite sex. Marriage exists as a protected legal institution primarily because of societal values associated with the propagation of the human race. No same sex couple offers the possibility of the birth of children by their union.
</blockquote>
You have commenced proceedings to challenge the refusal by the City Clerk's Office to issue a marriage licence to your clients on the basis that the refusal violates ss. 7 and 15, and cannot be justified under s. 1, of the <I>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. </I>Your clients are prepared to take the case to the Supreme Court of Canada if necessary. The Attorney General of Ontario opposes your application. What is your constitutional argument? What constitutional arguments of the Attorney General should you be concerned about? How will you answer these opposing arguments? Are you likely to succeed?
<p>
The following information may prove helpful in structuring the constitutional argument. Marriage is a status from which flow many legal rights and obligations, including such things as sponsorship in immigration law and medical decision-making powers if one spouse becomes incapacitated. Denmark is the only country in the western world to have essentially legalized same-sex marriage by creating a new status of &quot;registered partnership&quot; open only to same-sex couples and which carries almost all of the legal consequences of marriage. Some countries are beginning, in a piecemeal fashion, to recognize same-sex relationships as spousal relationships for some purposes, just as the law recognizes unmarried heterosexual couples as spouses for some purposes. In Ontario, a government bill to accord same-sex couples the same rights and obligations as heterosexual common-law couples was defeated in a free vote, even after the government deleted provisions allowing same-sex couples to adopt children, because of the perceived threat posed to the traditional family.
<p>
<h3>QUESTION 3</h3>
<b>Value - 25%<br>
Time - 45 Minutes</b>
<p>
In a recent Ontario election, a conservative party swept into office proclaiming &quot;a common sense revolution&quot;. Part of its platform proposes to &quot;get tough on crime and drugs&quot;. To this end, the government has announced increased funding for police patrols, drug testing for new public sector employees, and introduced new legislation entitled, <I>An Act regulating Illicit Drug Equipment and Literature (&quot;IDEAL Act&quot;).</I>
<p>
The <I>IDEAL Act </I>regulates the sale of drug-related instruments and drug-related paraphernalia in so-called head shops, and regulates the sale of publications and literature glamorizing, advocating and promoting the use of drugs. Its stated purpose is to protect vulnerable children and youth and to reduce the influence of organized crime involved in the distribution of illicit drugs.
<p>
It is clear from speeches given in the legislature that the Government was concerned about the fact that vulnerable children and youth were the recipients of a double message. On the one hand, the consumption of illegal drugs is banned and subject to severe penalty by federal law; on the other hand, drug paraphernalia shops freely sell instruments to aid in drug consumption and literature that promotes the consumption of illicit drugs. This dilemma was expressed by Ontario Provincial Police Assistant Commissioner Rod T. Stamler, who was a witness in legislative committee hearings. He stated:
<blockquote>
While organized crime groups are reaping massive profits from the illegal drug trade, we continue to permit the public sale of instruments and literature for drug use, which no doubt reinforces the motives and incentives of crime organizations in responding to the obvious demand for drug supplies. Parents are appalled at the open sale and availability of &quot;how-to&quot; publications, such as <I>How to Grow Marijuana and Magic Mushrooms, Cocaine Handbook, Tooting Tips </I>and <I>Grow Yer Own Stone. </I>The same is true for the availability of monthly issues of <I>High Times </I>magazine, published in the United States, which promotes and glamorizes the drug trade.
</blockquote>
Section 1 of the <I>IDEAL Act </I>states:
<blockquote>
&quot;equipment for illicit drug use&quot; means anything designed primarily or intended under the circumstances for consuming or to facilitate the consumption of an illicit drug.
<p>
&quot;literature for illicit drug use&quot; means any printed matter or video describing or depicting, and designed primarily or intended under the circumstances to promote, encourage or advocate the production, preparation or consumption of illicit drugs.
</blockquote>
Section 4 establishes an Illicit Drug Equipment and Literature Board (&quot;IDEAL Board&quot;), and s. 5 provides:
<blockquote>
5. (1) No place of business shall offer for sale without lawful excuse any equipment for illicit drug use or any literature for illicit drug use which has not been approved by the IDEAL Board.
<p>
(2) Any one contravening subs. (1) is guilty of an
offense and liable on summary conviction:
<p>
(a) for a first offense to a fine of not less than $2000.00;
<p>
(b) for second or subsequent offense to a fine of not less that $10,000 and not more than $40,000.
</blockquote>
Section 6 of the <I>IDEAL Act </I>provides:
<blockquote>
6. In determining whether to approve illicit drug equipment and literature for sale, the IDEAL Board shall not withhold approval of literature that contains depictions of drug use that are essential to a wider artistic, literary, medical or scientific purpose.
</blockquote>
A number of public interest groups have indicated that they consider that the legislation may contravene the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and that they intend to mount a Charter challenge. You are a lawyer at the Office of the Attorney General of Ontario. The Attorney General has asked you to prepare a memorandum addressing the issues that are likely to arise in a Charter challenge.

<P>
<h3>Question 1: one hour</h3>
<P>
The Church of Heaven is a relatively new and small religious sect.
It has a number of practices that seek to alleviate the stress
and alienation of modern urban life. Some of its prayer
and communal gatherings are held in its urban centres and others
are held in rural retreats. All activities emphasize a return
to nature, reading scripture, singing hymns, prayer and community.
There is a considerable amount of emphasis on spiritual maturity,
meaning accepting human life as a divine but finite gift. Communal
rituals mark events such as birth, marriage, divorce and death
as important spiritual turning points. There is a strong belief
in a happy and fulfilling afterlife.
<P>
The most distinctive feature of this new religion is to be found
in its death rituals. Because a &quot;good death&quot; is considered
one of the goals of life and part of the divine plan for entry
into the afterlife, there is an emphasis on accepting death as
an opportunity for spiritual growth for the individual and for
the community. When a member of the Church is nearing death, the
community gathers to give whatever support is needed, including
health care, meals, personal services, emotional support, spiritual
support and pain relief. Members of the faith who are closest
to the dying individual spend a lot of time discussing his or
her life's meaning and personal desire for a spiritually meaningful
death. The actual end of life is often a communal occasion, according
to the wishes of the individual. Although the details of these
deaths are held secret as part of the community's ritual knowledge
available only to its leaders, it is widely understood that --
while death comes naturally in some instances -- there is also
intervention to bring on death, especially to eliminate excessive
pain and suffering, including emotional pain and suffering, at
the end of life. A few recent autopsies have established that
death followed the administration of drugs and/or suffocation.
<P>
The Attorney General's Office is concerned and wants to turn its
attention to the Church's end of life ceremonies before things
get out of hand. Preliminary investigations have discovered rumours
of ritual suicides and assisted suicides in the past and plans
for many more. As news of the beauty and dignity of these end-of-life
services spreads, the Church is attracting a lot of attention
as well as an ever increasing number of adherents. Most of the
new members are people who have terminal diseases or extensive
disabilities.
<P>
The professional stance of the medical community is against assisting
suicide but individual doctors are clearly relieved of the emotional
burdens and physical demands of dying people. While the provincial
government doesn't want to be seen to approve or oppose the Church's
activities in a pre-election period, it sees clear advantages
in moving death out of hospitals and away from expenditures for
high technology life support systems, including artificial feeding
and hydration. The federal government is secure in its victory
in the Supreme Court of Canada in <I>Rodriguez </I>and takes the
position that the Supreme Court's upholding of the Criminal Code
prohibition against assisted suicide is secure in all circumstances
<P>
You are a lawyer with a number of dramatic success in <I>Charter
</I>litigation to your credit. A member of the Church approaches
you to settle the legal implications of the activities of the
Church, especially in respect to the end-of-life rituals. The
Church followed the <I>Rodriguez </I>case very carefully but is
confident that the Supreme Court would have reached a different
conclusion if the dying person had been a member of a recognized
religious community that could establish that its death rituals
conform to divine directives as revealed in holy scriptures and
are demonstrably consistent with a believing community's rituals
and teachings about the ultimate meaning of individual life as
well as life at large.
<P>
What <I>Charter </I>advice would you give the Heavenly Church?

the constitutionality of the <I>IDEAL Act. </I>In particular,
she has asked you to address the following issues:
<blockquote>
 (i) Does the <I>IDEAL Act </I>infringe s. 2(b) and, if so, can
it be justified under s. 1, of the <I>Canadian Charter </I>of Rights and Freedoms? (Your answer
to this issue will be worth 50% of Question 2.)
<P>
 (ii) Does the Province of Ontario possess the legislative authority
under s. 92 of the <I>Constitution Act, 1867</i> to enact the <I>IDEAL Act? </I>(Your
answer to this issue will be worth 50% of Question 2.)
</blockquote>
<P>
<h3>QUESTION 3: ONE HOUR</h3>
<P>
We have read a large number of cases this year that demonstrate
a variety of approaches to constitutional interpretation in a
number of contexts and by a number of different judges. These
cases manifest a range of approaches to the reading of the constitutional
text, first the <I>British North America Act, 1867</i> and later
the <I>Charter. </I>Consider the importance of the constitutional
text to the analysis and conclusions in the cases we have read.
To the extent that the text is not the main focus of constitutional
analysis, what is? A list of cases that might be interesting follows.
Please feel free to discuss these or any other cases that you
think illuminate the Problem.

<li>Able is in the business of constructing swimming pools. Baker,
who wants a swimming pool built on her property, contacts Able, explaining
that she wants a pool without a diving board, but deep enough for safe diving from the
edge. Able says that 6 feet would be perfectly safe, as indeed the official guidelines
confirm, but Baker, who has a great fear of diving accidents insists on a depth of 8 feet.
Able says this would cost an extra $2,000, above the standard price of $40,000, and
Baker agrees to a price of $42,000. Baker then signs an agreement, on Able's standard
form, which refers to details in Able's brochure, which in turn specify a minimum depth
of 6 feet. When the pool is completed Baker discovers that the depth at the deep
end is only 7 feet. The evidence is that the pool is perfectly safe, and the market
value of Baker's property is not affected by the departure from contract specifications.
Building the pool to the specifications would have cost Able $3,000 more that the actual
cost, but now that the pool is complete, the only way to deepen it would be to demolish
it and rebuild it, at a cost of $50,000. Baker says that, despite the expert assurances
of safety, she would personally feel more comfortable with the greater depth, and had
specified the depth for precisely that reason. Advise Baker.
<P>
<li>Albert and Bertha are husband and wife, aged 65. Albert has
recently retired from a moderately successful small business. Their only substantial asset
is their home, jointly owned, worth about $1,000,000. Their daughter, Charlotte, and
her common-law husband, Doug, have been pressing Albert and Bertha to assist
them in a business venture of Doug's. Doug wants to borrow $1,000,000 from the bank,
and is urging Albert and Bertha to mortgage their home to guarantee repayment
of the loan. Albert's instincts are against this proposal: the figures are
too large; he doubts the soundness of the business venture; he thinks that arrangements
of the sort proposed are apt to lead to family quarrels. But Charlotte is very insistent,
saying that her happiness is at stake, and Bertha supports her. Eventually Albert
agrees, and Albert, Bertha and Doug go together to Doug's bank. The manager does not
know of the precise relationship among the parties, but supposes that Albert
and Bertha must be Doug's relatives. She says that, following some disagreeable judicial
decisions, new bank policy is that in such cases the guarantors must have independent
advice. Albert's opinion of the legal profession, except in respect of its ability
to charge fees, is low, and he expresses his opinion in forceful terms. The manager says that
she sympathizes, adding that she thinks the judicial decisions were designed to
enhance employment opportunities for the legal profession, but that, unfortunately,
bank policy must be followed. She gives Albert the relevant documents with a form
stating: &quot;We, Albert and Bertha, hereby certify that we have received independent advice
about the transaction referred to herein, and that we fully understand the
effect of a guarantee and a mortgage. Name of independent adviser: &quot; The manager
says, &quot;Bring this form back tomorrow, duly signed, and I will authorize the loan&quot;.
Albert and Bertha take the form home, sign it, and the mortgage and guarantee forms,
without seeking any independent advice, insert the name of a local lawyer in the
certificate, and take the documents back to the bank. The loan is made to Doug, whose
business fails six months later, leaving him insolvent. No part of the loan has been
repaid, and Charlotte and Doug have now separated. Advise Albert and Bertha.

<center><h3>QUESTION 1</h3>
<I> [value 1/3]</I></center>
<P>
The organizers of the Annual Melmerby Beach Marathon (&quot;the
run for the lobsters&quot;) had great ambitions and wished to
put the race in the same league as Boston, New York, etc. (The
organizers are actually a corporation - MBM Ltd.) To this end
MBM energized itself, obtained corporate sponsorship, and generated
a substantial pile of cash with which to promote its race. One
of its basic strategies was to attract a few &quot;big name&quot;
runners to run the race and thus raise the profile of the 1995
event, which was scheduled for April 25th. MBM entered into individual
contracts with three internationally known marathoners: Alan Mewett
(&quot;The Cornwall Cheetah&quot;), Ernie Weinrib (&quot;The Kantian
Go Cart&quot;) and an American named Speedo Smith. These contracts
provided each runner with $10,000 for running in and completing
the race. Their appearances, especially that of Smith, were crucial
to the profile raising enterprise.
<P>
As well, MBM entered into a contract with Team Nike Ltd. an offshoot
of the giant shoe manufacturer which, following in the tradition
of bicycle races, has created a team of 6 professional marathoners
who run in various races and thus raise the profile of both Nike
and the race in question. Under the contract between MBM and Team
Nike Ltd., Team Nike was paid $20,000 for the appearance of the
team.
<P>
In all of these &quot;special appearance&quot; contracts there
appears a clause which reads: &quot;All runners agree to be bound
by the rules of the International Marathon Association including
the rules regarding race safety&quot; (other &quot;ordinary&quot;
runners make a similar agreement as part of registering for the
race). One of the well known rules of the Federation provides
that all runners undertake not to abandon any running equipment
or other material on a race route. This is aimed at preventing
injury to other runners.
<P>
The build up to the big race was a triumph of public relations
and bold boosterism. &quot;Speedo Smith to Run for the Lobsters&quot;
ran the headline on April 22nd in the local newspaper <cite>The Black
Harbour Bugle</cite>. The number of local entrants eager to run with
Speedo Smith, signed up was at an all time high and MBM expected
a large profit from entrants' fees, ticket sales for the finish
line bleachers, and sales of race paraphernalia (including a T-shirt
with the image of Speedo Smith crossing the finish line with lobsters
raised in both hands) which were going at a brisk pace.
<P>
On April 23, Speedo Smith, after learning that <b>his</b> name
was attracting a lot of attention and that he was getting the
same payment as Mewett and Weinrib, contacted MBM and indicated
that he was not feeling terribly well and probably would not be
able to run in the race, but also indicated that he might feel
considerably better if the committee would raise its appearance
fee to $25,000. MBM debated this issue long into the night of
the 23rd, and agreed with Speedo Smith on the 24th to meet his
new demands
<P>
During the race one of the Team Nike runners is injured when Speedo
Smith throws a can of clam juice over his shoulder after drinking
half of it. By stepping on the container a Team Nike runner, our
old friend Zoe, seriously aggravates an old injury forcing her
out of the race and causing her to become quite depressed. She
also had to forego an appearance on the Sports TV Network demonstrating
her running technique for a fee of $5,000. In addition this cost
her a spot on Team Nike for six months.
<P>
Now that the race is over (&quot;The Cornwall Cheetah Confounds
Again&quot; blared the <cite>Black Harbour Bugle</cite>) Speedo Smith
sues MBM for $25,000. Zoe sues Speedo Smith in contract claiming
compensation for her losses.
<P>
<B>Fully analyze and critically evaluate the legal predicament
in which the parties find themselves.</B>
<P>
<center><h3>QUESTION 2</h3>
<I>[value 2/3]</I></center>
<P>
Times have been hard on the east coast. Even Brian Tobin could
not bring back the groundfish stocks and, as a result, many of
those families engaged for years, even generations, in the inshore
fishing industry (fishing from small boats within 20 miles of
the coast) have had to abandon their way of life. Asa Macdonald
was one victim of the collapse of the inshore industry. He had
been fishing out of Black Harbour since he was 16, but he has
just recently sold his boat (&quot;The Crying Shame&quot;) for
just enough to pay off the bank loan with which he had bought
it, and has gone on unemployment insurance. But every cloud has
some element of a silver lining (at least that is what Asa's mum
had always said). While most fish stocks are declining there are
a few species historically underexploited and now flourishing.
One of those is the specialized snow-crab fishing industry. The
federal government very strictly controls access to this fishery
through a licensing scheme under which the number of licenses
is very limited. As a result the licences have become much sought
after as a ticket to financial success. It is rumoured that holders
of &quot;crab licences&quot; have made hundreds of thousands of
dollars a year.
<P>
Zack Macmurray is an accountant in nearby Tatamagouche who has
been keeping his eye open for local investment opportunities for
himself and some of his clients. He is aware that two months ago
the federal government announced a new programme (the &quot;Plan
to Rehabilitate the Inshore Fishery&quot; or PRIF for short) under
which the government would slightly expand the number of crab
fishing licences available and allocate them to those recently
forced out of the inshore fishing industry in certain locations
in the Province of Nova Scotia - including Black Harbour. Sensing
an opportunity for investment, Zack starts looking for a person
just exiting the inshore fishing business. He had seen a notice
at the local co-op for the sale of &quot;The Crying Shame&quot;
and had made a note of Asa's number
<P>
Zack called Asa and they get together for a chat. Asa explains
that he does not have enough money to buy the special kind of
boat and equipment required for crab fishing and that in spite
of the fact that he might be a candidate for one of the new licences,
he will be unable to take advantage of the programme. Zack explains
that he is in a position to finance the acquisition of the new
equipment and help with the application for the licence under
the PRIF programme in return for &quot;fair return on my investment&quot;
as Zack put it. Asa asked Zack how much he thought could be made
in the crab fishing industry. Zack replied, &quot;Why if we don't
make $300,000 out of that licence a year I will give up drinking
beer.&quot;
<P>
This sounded all very interesting to Asa but, being a cautious
guy, he asked Zack what would happen if a licence were not awarded
to him; to which Zack replied, &quot;Don't worry - it's in the
bag - you are exactly the kind of guy they are looking for, and
besides, the local MP is a good friend of mine. Believe me, it's
a done deal.&quot;
<P>
So, on the evening of April 24th Asa and Zack agree that Asa would
acquire and Zack pay for a new crab boat (costing approximately
$300,000), that Zack would be paid back in installments at $30,000
per year minimum, and that Zack would get 50% of the profits from
the crab fishing enterprise. Zack promises to have the agreement
drawn up by his lawyer, and that they could sign it later because
time is of the essence. The deadline applications under the PRIF
programme is the next morning. Asa and Zack fill out the application
form that evening and Asa, because he lives closer, agrees to
take it down to the federal office in Melmerby Beach the next
morning before the 12 noon deadline.
<P>
On the way home that evening Asa drops into the boat manufacturing
operation of Bobby and Carol McDonough of Merrigomish Harbour
and agrees to buy the crab boat they are currently building at
a price of $300,000. Asa and Zack knew that the market for crab
boats will really heat up when the new licences are announced
and that it is a smart thing to jump at the chance to obtain a
boat now.
<P><blockquote>
 (a) Yes. It had to happen (&quot;every silver lining has a cloud&quot;
as Asa's dad used to say). Asa got up early to drive to the federal building in Melmerby Beach
but found that the local highway at the end of his driveway was closed for the running,
you will recall, of the Melmerby Beach Marathon. As a result he did not arrive at the
federal building until 12:30 in the afternoon - after the deadline. To his astonishment
there was a notice in the door saying that the office was closed that day anyway and that
the deadline for new crab licences under the PRIF programme had been moved up to 5:00 p.m.
the day before (the 24th), as had been announced last week by the Programme's Director
in Ottawa.
<P>
<B>Analyze fully and critically evaluate the legal predicament
in which the parties find themselves.</B>
<P>
 (b) Suppose that Asa makes it to the federal office in time,
it was not closed, and the application was timely; however, two weeks later Asa receives
a letter from the federal government telling him that he has not been awarded a licence.
(Apparently the number of applications was so great the programme had to resort to a
lottery to award the licences.) Upon hearing this Asa becomes very depressed.
<P>
<B>Analyze fully and critically evaluate the legal predicament
in which the parties find themselves.</B>
<P>
 (c) Suppose that the application goes in on time, and the application
is granted. Asa and Zack agreed to meet to celebrate the event at the local pub (recently
renamed &quot;The Admiral Tobin&quot;) over a few beers. They toast themselves and
sign a document Zack has drawn up containing their deal. Then for three years the crab
fishing industry goes reasonably well and Asa is catching crab at about $150,000 a year
before payments. Asa pays back $50,000 per year on the boat loan. Asa can see that
it will take longer than he had expected to pay off the loan for the boat from Zack. The
licence on the other hand is worth quite a lot and there is a thriving market in their
re-sale. Asa figures he could sell the licence, pay off his debt to Zack and retire earlier
than planned. When Asa approaches Zack with this idea, Zack tells him that that would
be a breach of their agreement - in particular Clause 15 which reads: &quot;[Asa] agrees
to pay 50% of the early profits to [Zack] and to repay the boat loan of $300,000 in installments
of at least $30,000 per year. In no event shall [Asa] be released from this
contract until he has paid back the loan and [Zack] has obtained $1,000,000 in profits. If
[Asa] breaches this contract [Zack] shall have the right to seize the boat, keep all
installments, and be entitled to all profits from the sale of the licence.&quot;
<P>
Upon reading these last two sentences, for the first time, Asa
has figured out he will have to keep working for a long time in
order to repay the $1,000,000 profit sharing obligation. Asa comes
to you for advice.
<P>
<B>Analyze fully and critically evaluate the legal predicament
in which the parties find themselves.</B>

 40% 1. In <cite>Chicago Coliseum Club v. Dempsey</cite> (1932) 265
Ill. App. 542 (facts slightly adapted),  Chicago Coliseum Club brought an action against Jack Dempsey,
alleging breach of a written  contract executed on March 13, 1926, under which the plaintiff
was to promote a boxing match  between Dempsey and Harry Wills for the World Heavy Weight Boxing
Championship. Under  the terms of the agreement, plaintiff agreed to pay Dempsey
a sum equal to 50 percent of the  net profits over and above the sum of $2 million in the event
that gate receipts should exceed  that amount. The defendant further agreed not to engage in any
boxing match after the date of  the agreement and prior to the date on which the contest was
to be held. On March 6, 1926, the  plaintiff entered into an agreement with Harry Wills to engage
in a boxing match with Dempsey.  Under this agreement, the plaintiff was to pay Wills $50,000
immediately and to pay him 10  percent of gate receipts in excess of $2 million. On March 8,
1926, the plaintiff entered into  a contract with one Andrew Weisberg to promote the boxing match.
The agreement  contemplated that it would be necessary to incur expenditures
in the way of travelling expenses,  legal services, and other costs in the promotion of the boxing
match. Under this agreement  Weisberg was to furnish the funds for these purposes and was
to be reimbursed out of receipts  from the sale of tickets, together with a certain amount for
his services. Under the terms of the contracts between the plaintiff and Dempsey and the plaintiff
and Wills, the boxing contest was  to be held during the month of September 1926. On July 10, 1926
the plaintiff received a  telegram from Dempsey indicating that because of flagging ticket
sales for the match with Wills  he had committed himself instead to a boxing match with Gene
Tunney for the World  Championship and refusing to proceed with the planned match
with Wills. Instead he offered  to fight Wills after the match with Tunney (for which the promised
remuneration was much  greater). The plaintiff rejected his offer.
<P>
The plaintiff filed an action against Dempsey for breach of contract, seeking the  following relief.
<ol>
 <li> An injunction enjoining Dempsey from engaging in the contest
with Tunney.
<P>
 <li> Loss of profits which would have been derived by the plaintiff
in the event of the holding of the boxing match between Dempsey and Wills as contemplated
in the contract of  March 13, 1926.

If an identical set of facts were to arise today in Ontario how
would a court decide these issues on the basis of Ontario law?
If further evidence would be required to resolve some of these
issues, indicate the nature of that evidence.
<P>

40% 2. a) Last year, the Halifax Harbour Commission (hereinafter
&quot;the Commission&quot;) advertised an invitation for tenders
&quot;to purchase a 1962 Loveboat cruise ship submerged on Aberlone
Reef approximately 10 miles offshore, north east of Halifax...&quot;
Your client, a ship operating company, submitted a $20,000 tender
for the purchase of the vessel, describing it as &quot;a cruise
ship lying on Aberlone Reef as advertised.&quot; $2,000 of this
sum were paid upfront by your client as deposit. The Commission
accepted your client's bid and deposit. Accordingly, your client
made preparations to salvage the vessel. They proceeded to fit
one of their towboats with diving and salvage equipment and engaged
a crew as well as an acknowledged expert in salvage work. These
preparations entailed substantial expenditures, amounting to some
$30,000. Your client now acknowledges to you that it would not
have been very difficult to take steps to find out whether there
was in fact a cruise ship in the locality advertised before these
preparations were made. In any case, your client's preparations
were wholly wasted because no cruise ship was ever found lying
at or near the place specified by the Commission. You are to assume
that there had been a 1962 Loveboat at that place, but that she
had been washed away before the Commission advertised for tenders,
and that the Commission had been negligent (although in no way
fraudulent) in advertising that she was still there. You may also
assume that, had the Commission used reasonable care before advertising,
it could have ascertained with virtual certainty whether the ship
was still there.
<P>
Your client's requests to the Commission for compensation have
been unsuccessful to date. The Commission argues the contract
is invalid or at least unenforceable because of mistake. Your
client wants to know whether the Commission is correct on this
point, and in the event that it is, whether they can nonetheless
expect to recover at least their $2,000 deposit and $30 000 of
expenditures.
<P>
b) Same as (a), except that your client is Toronto's Maritime
Museum, which was hoping to add a 1962 Loveboat to its collection,
and, although a cruise ship is indeed found on Aberlone Reef,
it is a 1964 Loveboat, which the Museum already owns. Also assume
that the Commission's advertisement included the following clause,
which your client read, understood and accepted at the time of
making the bid:
<blockquote>
&quot;THE PURCHASER AGREES TO TAKE THE CRUISE SHIP IN THE STATE
AND CONTITION IT IS FOUND.&quot;
</blockquote>
How do these new facts modify your answer in (a), if at all?
<p>
c) Same as (a). In addition, assume that the Vessel Salvaging
Act requires that towboats used in the salvaging of Loveboats
and bigger vessels be &quot;Size A towboats with Grade A towing
licenses,&quot; and that your client owns a Size A towboat, but
never bothered to obtain a Grade A license for it.
<P>
 20% 3. Facts identical to those in <cite>Barclays Bank v. O'Brien</cite>,
[1993] 3 W.L.R. 786, arise before  the Supreme Court of Canada today. You are to brief the Court
as to whether or not it is  desirable, from a policy perspective, that the reasoning and
conclusions of the House of Lords  in that case be followed.

<P>
 1. Jack Finch, the accused, is charged with manslaughter under
the following circumstances.
<P>
Finch lives in the town of Yukon, Ontario, a small rural community
not far from Sudbury. Finch, who fancies himself as an artist,
has erected in his front garden, a large object made mostly of
welded scrap metal which he calls &quot;Disco Delight&quot;. On
the fence round his property is a large sign reading &quot;NO
TRESPASSING. DO NOT TOUCH ART WORK&quot;. Jack is no welder and
in fact the whole structure is far from safe, though he personally
thought it quite safe. His neighbours, who consider the object
an eyesore, complained to the Town Council, which issued a demolition
order stating: <b>This structure has not received the required
permit and has not been inspected for safety.</b>
<P>
The Council acted under Town Ordinance 1992-813 which states:
<blockquote>
No person shall erect on his or her property any structure larger
than 3' in height and 2' in diameter without first obtaining a
permit therefor. Such permit shall be granted only where Council
considers the structure both safe and environmentally acceptable.
</blockquote>
The Municipal Act of Ontario enables the Town Council to pass
such bylaws and no question arises as to the validity of the Ordinance.
<P>
Finch neither applied for nor obtained such a permit and ignored
the demolition order.
<P>
One evening last summer when Finch was watching TV. he heard a
commotion in the garden. Going outside, he discovered Peter Pann,
a local thirteen year old teenager, lying under the structure
which had collapsed on him. He was bleeding profusely, while his
friend, Jeremy Pott, was trying to help him. It turned out that
the two had trespassed onto the property and had been climbing
over Disco Delight
<P>
&quot;Help&quot;, said Jeremy, &quot;Get an ambulance quick&quot;,
to which Finch replied, &quot;It's your own damn fault. I'm watching
TV. You'll have to wait until the show is over&quot; and he went
back inside. Jeremy did the best he could and rushed off to find
a telephone which took him about ten minutes. The town's only
ambulance was off on another call and did not arrive on the scene
for another twenty minutes. By this time Peter had lost a lot
of blood and when he got to the local hospital the doctors were
going to give him a blood transfusion when his parents, who had
arrived on the scene, refused to give permission. They belong to the Children of the Blessed Sect which
prohibits the receiving of blood transfusions. The doctors proceeded
to argue with them saying it was Peter's decision, not theirs,
but they were adamant. The doctors in fact called the police and
were about to give the transfusion in spite of the parents' objection
but it was too late. Peter had expired. The doctors are unanimously
of the view that if he had received the transfusion immediately
upon arrival his life would probably have been saved.
<P>
 2. The four accused are Nick Nerd, 22, Pete Pole, 23, Frank Fink,
22 and Gary Grebb, also 22. They have known each other as friends for a number
of years and hang out together. Last summer, they all agreed to rob
the patrons of a trendy cafe, The Bolero Bistro. They agreed that
they wouldn't take any firearms with them, but that Nick and Pete would have
with them realistic toy pistols, while Frank and Gary would take with them
their flick knives. Actually, the other three all knew that Pete liked playing
with guns and had a real semi-automatic which he'd shown them and they were
aware that he has twice been convicted already for armed robbery. Nick
repeated, &quot;no guns, uh?&quot; to which Pete replied, &quot;O.K., O.K.,
I heard you the first time&quot;.
<P>
Next night, as planned, the four arrived at the Bolero half an
hour before closing time, went in but then saw that the place
seemed too crowded. Getting cold feet, they merely sat down and
ordered coffee, at which point Gary said, &quot;I don't like it
guys. I'm pulling out of this. You go ahead if you want to but
leave me out of it&quot;.
<P>
The following night, the remaining three returned to the Bolero,
again half an hour before closing time. This time, there were
three trendy looking patrons there and two members of the staff.
Nick and Pete pulled out the pistols, while Frank brandished his
knife. They yelled for the five people in there to lie on the
floor and hand over all their valuables. One of the patrons, Charles
Chichester, resisted and started to insult the three calling them
&quot;no-good punks&quot;. At this point, Pete started hitting
him, Nick calling out to him, &quot;Give him hell, Pete. The bastard&quot;.
Frank, meanwhile, was ignoring the assault and was busy emptying
the till. Pete knocked the patron, stunned, to the floor and then
continued collecting valuables from the other persons in the cafe.
<P>
At this point, a second patron, Lucinda Labelle, made a dash for
the door in an attempt to escape, whereupon Pete pointed his pistol
at her and fired. It turned out that it was not a toy pistol at all, but his real semi-automatic.
Lucinda fell to the floor, injured in the hip and bleeding profusely
but she has since fully recovered. Frank shouted out, &quot;Christ,
you've killed her. Let's get the hell out of here&quot; and the
three started to leave, but as they left, Pete turned and fired
his semi-automatic at Charles who was just beginning to regain
consciousness. The bullet hit him in the head, killing him outright.
The other victims heard Frank say, &quot;F**k, man, why the hell
did you do that? That was no part of the plan&quot;.
<P>
What is the criminal liability of each of the four accused?
<P>

 3. You are a Judge of the Supreme Court of Canada and must, after
all arguments have been presented, decide on the validity of the new
&quot;No Defence of Extreme Drunkenness&quot; provisions of the new Bill
which, for the purposes of this examination we will assume has been duly enacted.
<P>
Write your judgment.
<P>
The full text of the new provisions is as follows:
<blockquote>
<cite>An Act to amend the Criminal Code (self-induced intoxication)</cite>
<P>
WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada is gravely concerned about the
incidence of violence in Canadian society;
<P>
WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada recognizes that violence has
a particularly disadvantaging impact on the equal participation
of women and children in society and on the rights of women and
children to security of the person and to the equal protection
and benefit of the law as guaranteed by sections 7, 15 and 28
of the <cite>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite>;
<P>
WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada recognizes that there is a close
association between violence and intoxication and is concerned
that self-induced intoxication may be used socially and legally
to excuse violence against women and children;
<P>
WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada recognizes that the potential
effects of alcohol and certain drugs on human behaviour are well-known to Canadians and is aware of scientific
evidence that many intoxicants, including alcohol, may cause a
person to act involuntarily;
<P>
WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada shares with Canadians the moral
view that people who, while in a state of self-induced intoxication,
violate the physical integrity of others are blameworthy in relation
to their harmful conduct and should be held criminally accountable
for it;
<P>
WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada desires to promote and help to
ensure the full protection of the rights guaranteed under sections
7, 11, 15 and 28 of the <cite>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
</cite> for all Canadians, including those who may be victims of violence;
<P>
WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada considers it necessary to legislate
a basis of criminal fault in relation to self-induced intoxication
and general intent offences involving violence;
<P>
WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada recognizes the continuing existence
of a common law principle that intoxication to an extent that
is less than that which would cause a person to lack the ability
to form the basic intent or have the voluntariness required to
commit a criminal offence of general intent is never a defence
to at law;
<P>
AND WHEREAS the Parliament of Canada considers it necessary and
desirable to legislate a standard of care, in order to make it
clear that a person who, while in a state of incapacity by reason
of self-induced intoxication, commits an offence involving violence
against another, departs markedly from the standard of reasonable
care that Canadians owe to each other and is thereby criminally
at fault;
<P>
NOW, THEREFORE, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent
of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:
<P>
1. The <B>Criminal Code</B> is amended by adding the following
after section 33:
<P>
<center><I>Self-induced Intoxication</I></center>
<P>
33.1 (1) It is not a defence to an offence referred to in subsection
(3) that the accused, by reason of self-induced intoxication,
lacked the basic intent or the voluntariness required to commit
the offence, where the accused departed markedly from the standard
of care as described in subsection (2).
<P>
(2) For the purposes of this section, a person departs markedly
from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian
society and is thereby criminally at fault where the person, while
in a state of self-induced intoxication that renders the person
unaware of, or incapable of consciously controlling, their behaviour,
voluntarily or involuntarily interferes or threatens to interfere
with the bodily integrity of another person.
<P>
(3) This section applies in respect of an offence under this Act
or any other Act of Parliament that includes as an element an
assault or other interference or threat of interference by a person
with the bodily integrity of another person.
<P>
2. <B>This Act shall come into forces on a day to be fixed by
order of the Governor in Council.</B>

<P>
1. Frank and Gwen lived together as common-law spouses. Frank
was sixty-seven years old, partially blind, and of subnormal intelligence.
Gwen was fifty and, according to a psychologist's report, &quot;ineffectual,
passive, and of low average intelligence&quot;. Frank had dropped
out of school after grade eight, Gwen after grade twelve.
<P>
Living with Frank and Gwen was Frank's sister Liz, who was sixty-five
at the date of her death. Liz had come to live with her brother
as a lodger after her sister, with whom she had been living for
several years, evicted her. Liz paid Frank and Gwen for room and
board from her monthly old age pension cheque. Gwen did the shopping
for the household.
<P>
Liz was suffering from anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder characterized
by an irrational fear of gaining weight. As a result, she would
deny herself proper meals, consuming only biscuits and some mineral
water once a day. Liz's behaviour was eccentric in other ways
as well. She would confine herself to her room for days on end,
coming out only at night when Frank and Gwen were asleep to take
her biscuits. In the weeks immediately preceding her death, this
behaviour became more extreme, as she refused to get out of bed
even to wash or to perform natural functions.
<P>
Liz was found dead by Gwen on the morning of July 14, 1994. Her
emaciated body was covered in sores from her immobilization and
weighed sixty pounds. Many of the sores went down to the bone.
A policeman described the conditions in which she was found as
follows:
<blockquote>
There was no ventilation in the bedroom. At one side of the bed
on a chair was an empty mineral water bottle and a cup. Under
the bed was an empty bucket. Otherwise there was no washing or
toilet facilities in the room. There was excrement on the bed
and floor. The bedclothes were soaked with urine. It was a scene
of dreadful degradation.
</blockquote>
During the last few weeks of her life, Liz refused whatever little
assistance Frank and Gwen offered. Gwen brought her food, but
Liz left it untouched. When Gwen asked Liz the name of her doctor,
Liz refused to tell her for fear of being &quot;put away&quot;.
Gwen made some half-hearted attempts to locate Liz's doctor on
her own, but soon gave up. She (Gwen) said she told Frank to try
to find another doctor, but Frank always said, &quot;Let's leave
it till tomorrow.&quot; When asked why she didn't call an ambulance
or the police, Gwen replied that &quot;Liz never complained and
so I didn't think it was serious. Anyway, Liz wasn't my sister,
and I didn't dare do anything without Frank, 'cause he's the boss.&quot;
When asked the same question, Frank answered:
<blockquote>
I didn't think she was dying. She had gone to bed for long stretches
before and then got up again and been all right. I'm almost blind
and so I couldn't tell whether she was looking good or not. I
went up three days before she died and asked her if she was all
right, and she said &quot;Yes.&quot;
</blockquote>
<P>
According to the coroner, the cause of death was lack of food
and toxemia spreading from the infected sores. He said that it
would have taken several weeks for Liz to deteriorate to the state
in which she was found. He also said that the infections could
have been prevented by keeping Liz clean and that the sores were
caused by lack of mobility.
<P>
Discuss the criminal liability of Frank and Gwen.
<P>
2. Recall the facts in <cite>R. v. Campbell and Mlynarchuk</cite>. Assume
that the Criminal Code offence of which Darlene Campbell was convicted
is punishable on indictment by a maximum fine of $5,000 and/or
a maximum term of two years in jail and on summary conviction
by a fine of up to $1,000. Assume also that the performance for
which she was charged took place in 1995. Ms. Campbell has come
to you because she wants to appeal her conviction (despite receiving
an absolute discharge, she is indignant at having a criminal record).
You see this case as a good one with which to mount a constitutional
challenge to s. 19 of the Criminal Code. Ms. Campbell has applied
for legal aid to the Legal Aid Sub-Committee for Group Applications
and Test Cases. The sub-committee has asked you to present a brief
commenting in detail on the chances for a successful challenge
to s. 19 under the <cite>Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</cite> Write
the brief. Be specific about the remedy you will be seeking.
<P>
3. H. L. A. Hart has written that &quot;[l]egal recognition of
the importance of excusing conditions is never unqualified; the
law, like every other human institution, has to compromise with
other values besides whatever values are incorporated in the recognition
of some conditions as excusing.&quot; 
<P>
Defend or criticize this statement with reference to any <b>two</b>
of the following excuses: mistake of fact, intoxication, and automatism.

1. Sam is a curious ten year old boy who unfortunately likes
to play in the trash piles behind Medical Waste Inc. Sam is very allergic to insulin and one night
last month while playing in the trash at Medical Waste Inc., he accidentally stuck himself
with a needle with insulin. Unfortunately he died after the ambulance driver misdiagnosed
his reactions as epilepsy and did not provide a common antidote for the allergy.
<P>
Medical Waste Inc. is a licensed medical waste company, owned
and managed by Joan who generally works 16 hour days on the site.
Joan has contracted with a security guard company to provide night
watchmen and most nights for the last month John was the security
guard. Joan left all security guards instructions to empty needles
into an approved hard bin before putting them out back for disposal.
<P>
John, the security guard, is 64 years old and in poor physical
and mental health. He has a severe drinking problem and a history
of passing out after drinking. He also suffers from a paranoid
psychosis which makes him believe that he has the power to neutralize
any harm that others face. On most nights, he takes a rather lackadaisical
approach to the disposal of medical waste in part because he thinks
his special powers neutralize any harm that might come from the
waste.
<P>
On the night in question, John had been drinking since morning
and was severely intoxicated when he arrived at work, shortly
after Joan went home for the day. As he began to take the fatal
needle out in a soft paper bag, John began to feel very ill and
eventually passed out in the lot behind Medical Waste. As he passed
out, the bag fell out of his hand to the ground where Sam found
it shortly after. John did not wake for some time and when he
did, he forgot what he was doing and went back inside to sleep
it off.
<P>
Section 1 of the <cite>Flavelle Waste Disposal Act</cite> states: &quot;It
is an absolute liability offence for a licensed medical waste
disposal company to dispose of needles in any container other
than an approved hard bin. It is a strict liability offence for
any person in the employ of a licensed medical waste disposal
company to dispose of needles in any container other than an approved
hand bin.&quot;
<P>
You are articling for the Crown and the Crown Attorney wants a
memorandum discussing whether John and/or Medical Waste Inc. should
be charged with manslaughter and/or a violation of s. 1 of the
<cite>Flavelle Waste Disposal Act.</cite> In addition, she wants to
know what arguments can be anticipated in the defence of John
and the company to the various charges. The Crown Attorney has
heard a rumour that John is willing to plead to manslaughter and
also wants your views about what sentence would be appropriate
and for what reasons.
<P>
 2. Henry and Alison are a couple who are exiles from a small
country, Falconer. They had to leave the country because of their political activities and
Henry had been tortured before he escaped Falconer.
<P>
Henry wants to make a political statement about political conditions
in Falconer and has planned to seize an airliner from Falconer
Air so that he could make a statement to the media. Alison did
not think this was a good idea but went along because she had
seen Henry go into rages when people had opposed his political
ideas in the past. Henry had struck her two years ago when they
had first lived together but had not struck her since.
<P>
Henry also made secret arrangements (not even disclosed to Alison)
with the pilot of the airliner to co-operate in the seizure of
the plane. He had also secured a gun that could be smuggled through
airport security. Alison refused to carry the gun into the plane
but did agree to stand at the cockpit door when Henry tried to
seize the plane.
<P>
When Henry went into the cockpit to his great surprise he saw
not his pilot friend, but the general who had been in charge of
his previous torture. The general grinned at Henry and said &quot;we
have you back now&quot;. Henry was very shocked but somehow managed
to pull the trigger and shoot the general dead. Both Henry and
Alison are charged with first degree murder and attempted hijacking
under s.76 of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>.
<P>
You are articling for the Legal Aid Office and the Director wants
a memorandum discussing what the Crown must prove and what defences
are available to Henry and Alison respectively.

1. Arnie was charged with manslaughter, and was tried by Lorraine J. sitting without a jury. Lorraine J.'s decision was as follows:
<blockquote>
The accused Arnie and the victim, his dear friend Ernie, were both 20 years old and had grown up as members of a small religious group, based in Haliburton, who call themselves &quot;The Children of Ice.&quot; One of the central tenets of this group is that fire is an instrument of the Devil: they never use any cooking or heating device that has an open flame, nor do they ever have matches, or any other implement that could be use to create a flame, in their houses. Early in 1994, Arnie and Ernie decided to leave the Children of Ice. They moved to Toronto, where they were unable to find a job or a place to live. Ultimately, having run out of money, they moved into an abandoned house on Charles Street. Ernie was unaccountably attracted to the street life of Toronto, and had begun smoking crack cocaine; Arnie retained the aversion to flames instilled in him by his childhood religion and would have nothing to do with Ernie's habit.
<p>
On the night in question, Arnie was going to sleep while Ernie was smoking his nightly crack. Arnie awoke some time later and observed that Ernie's mattress was in flames, but that Ernie himself was nowhere in sight. Afraid to approach the flames, Arnie left the house to look for Ernie. Unfortunately, as it turned out, Ernie was in another room in the house. He would have had ample time to escape but, befuddled by the crack, he was unable to perceive the danger he was in, and was killed when the fire spread from the mattress and burned the house down.
<p>
I find that Arnie committed an arson offense as defined in s. 433 of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>, in that he recklessly caused damage by fire to property, which fire caused bodily harm to Ernie. Since this unlawful act caused Ernie's death, Arnie is guilty as charged.
</blockquote>
Section 433 of the <I>Criminal Code </I>reads as follows:
<blockquote>
433. Every person who intentionally or recklessly causes damage by fire or explosion to property, whether or not that person owns the property, is guilty of an indictable offense and liable to imprisonment for life where
<blockquote>
(a) the person knows that or is reckless with respect to whether the property is inhabited or occupied; or<br> (b) the fire or explosion causes bodily harm to another person
</blockquote></blockquote>
Arnie's conviction was affirmed by the Ontario Court of Appeal, and he has been granted leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. You are a lawyer in the Crown's office responsible for drafting the Crown's factum. Write a memorandum to your file, outlining the submissions the appellant is likely to make and your best responses. Be sure to indicate your opinion as to whether the appeal will succeed.
<p>
2. The four accused are Nick Nerd, 22, Pete Pole, 23, Frank Fink, 22 and Gary Grebb, also 22. They have known each other as friends for a number of years and hang out together. Last summer, they all agreed to rob the patrons of a trendy cafe, The Bolero Bistro. They agreed that they wouldn't take any firearms with them, but that Nick and Pete would have with them realistic toy pistols, while Frank and Gary would take with them their flick knives. Actually, the other three all knew that Pete liked playing with guns and had a real semi-automatic which he'd shown them and they were aware that he has twice been convicted already for armed robbery. Nick repeated, &quot;no guns, uh?&quot; to which Pete replied, &quot;O.K., O.K., I heard you the first time&quot;.
<p>
One night, as planned, the four arrived at the Bolero half an hour before closing time, went in but then saw that the place seemed too crowded. Getting cold feet, they merely sat down and ordered coffee, at which point Gary said, &quot;I don't like it guys. I'm pulling out of this. You go ahead if you want to but leave me out of it&quot;.
The following night, the remaining three returned to the Bolero, again half an hour before closing time. This time, there were three trendy looking patrons there and two members of the staff. Nick and Pete pulled out the pistols, while Frank brandished his knife. They yelled for the five people in there to lie on the floor and hand over all their valuables. One of the patrons, Charles Chichester, resisted and started to insult the three calling them &quot;no-good punks&quot;. At this point, Pete started hitting him, Nick calling out to him, &quot;Give him hell, Pete. The bastard&quot;. Frank, meanwhile, was ignoring the assault and was busy emptying the till. Pete knocked the patron, stunned, to the floor and then continued collecting valuables from the other persons in the caf&eacute;.
<p>
At this point, a second patron, Lucinda Labelle, made a dash for the door in an attempt to escape, whereupon Pete pointed his pistol at her and fired. It turned out that it was not a toy pistol at all, but his real semi-automatic. Lucinda fell to the floor, injured in the hip and bleeding profusely but she has since fully recovered. Frank shouted out, &quot;Christ, you've killed her. Let's get the hell out of here&quot; and the three started to leave, but as they left, Pete turned and fired his semi-automatic at Charles who was just beginning to regain consciousness. The bullet hit him in the head, killing him outright. The other victims heard Frank say, &quot;F**k, man, why the hell did you do that? That was no part of the Plane.
<p>
What is the criminal liability of each of the four accused?

<p>
<b>Question 2. (50 marks)</b><p>
Kirk has a long criminal record as a street-level dealer in cocaine. The last time he was released from jail on a drug charge, he swore to himself that he would &quot;go straight&quot; and would no longer deal in illegal drugs. But, because of his criminal past, he was unable to get a legitimate job. Bowing to the inevitable but determined to keep his promise to himself, Kirk asked his friend Spock, a lawyer practising civil litigation, whether there were any new drugs on the scene that had not yet been banned by the federal government. Spock told Kirk that there was a relatively new drug, with the street name &quot;dilithium&quot;, that had not yet been made illegal. To be doubly sure, Kirk phoned Chekov, an R.C. M.P. Officer, and asked him, &quot;Is dilithium illegal yet?&quot; Chekov said, &quot;Just a minute&quot;, and consulted the relevant Schedules to the <cite>Narcotic Control Act </cite>and the <cite>Food and Drug Act</cite>. Chekov told Kirk that he did not see dilithium listed anywhere. Kirk then obtained a supply of what he took to be dilithium from Rand, who used to be his main wholesale provider of cocaine.
<p>
Three days later, R.C.M.P. Constable McCoy was conducting an undercover operation on Enterprise Avenue, a well-known drug dealing area. He saw Spock hanging around, and asked him, &quot;Where can a guy get some coke around here?&quot; Spock directed McCoy to the outdoor patio of a nearby donut shop. Several suspicious looking persons, including Kirk, were sitting at the tables. McCoy approached Kirk, who appeared to be asleep, and said, &quot;How much for an 8-ball of coke?&quot; Kirk said, &quot;Got no coke; you want dilithium?&quot; McCoy said, &quot;Sure&quot;, and purchased 50 g of white powder. On analysis, the white powder turned out to be cocaine after all.
<p>
Kirk and Spock are charged with trafficking in cocaine. Kirk says that he was extremely drunk when the transaction occurred. He was an inexperienced drinker, and had consumed roughly half a bottle of Saurian brandy that day. He has some vague recollection of speaking with McCoy, but does not recall handing over the white powder or receiving any money for it. Spock says that he knew that Enterprise Avenue was a drug dealing area, but he did not know that Kirk was at the donut shop. He says he was meeting his girlfriend Uhura, and that he told McCoy about the donut shop just to get rid of him before Uhura arrived.
<p>
&quot;Dilithium&quot; is the street name for diethylproprion, which is a controlled drug under the <cite>Food and Drug Act. </cite>Section 39 of the Act makes it an offense to &quot;traffic&quot; (defined in s. 38) in a controlled drug. Cocaine is a narcotic under the <cite>Narcotic Control Act. </cite>Section 4 of the Act makes it an offense to &quot;traffic&quot; (defined in s. 2) in a narcotic.
<p>
What is the criminal liability of Kirk and Spock?

<hr><p>
<B>Question 1 (Counting for 55 percent of the total mark)</b><p>
AB is a strong advocate of a woman's right to choose abortion, and is upset at statements from the Vatican that require that, in observance of their moral duty, legislators ensure that the law of their jurisdictions punishes abortion unless justified on narrowly defined grounds. AB joined several friends to attend divine service at a local Roman Catholic church where they believed the sermon would urge obedience to recent Vatican pronouncements. The church is an historic, wooden-fitted structure with a sizable upper gallery accessed only by a circular wooden staircase. Older members of the congregation meet here to obtain a clear view of the service while seated. AB and several friends sat in front pews, below the pulpit, concealing in their clothes small signs and leaflets they intended to exhibit and scatter at a point in the sermon that CD, a colleague of AB's, would indicate. AB believed that other protesters might be present in the church, but did not want to be part of anything more than dignified dissent and giving of information.
<p>
As the priest entered the pulpit, AB, CD and colleagues readied themselves to show dissent. In the pulpit, the priest took a sip of water and cleared his throat when a loud bang and a bright flash of light came from the back of the upper gallery. CD said loudly to AB &quot;The fools! They brought fire bombs and people could get hurt in here!&quot;
<p>
AB rushed forward to the rear stairway to the pulpit and mounted it shouting at the priest &quot;Stop the sermon! Stop the sermon! Someone could be hurt because of this!&quot; As AB entered the pulpit, the concealed signs and leaflets fell loose, and some floated down among the first pews. Then an authoritative voice from the gallery shouted &quot;It's O.K. It's just a blown fuse. We'll carry on with just a few of the lights out.&quot; AB, CD and their colleagues, in some confusion and disarray, left the church before the service resumed.
<p>
The priest, shaken by AB's approach and shouting, and distressed at the materials of protest AB had brought into the church, complained to the police.
<p>
AB has been charged with the offense, contrary to section s.176(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, of assaulting or offering violence to a minister of religion on his way to perform a function in connection with his calling.
<p>
Explain, with legal reasons, how you would defend AB against conviction.
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b><blockquote>You have not been given precise wording of the indictment, and should not raise such procedural matters as whether it is void for vagueness. Apply the facts to the words of s.176, and explain your defence strategy.</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Question 2 (Counting for 45 percent of the total mark)</b><p>
Section 8 of the Endangered Birds Act of Ontario [<b>Note:</b> This is a fictitious Act] provides that &quot;Whoever is found without lawful authority on lands designated as protected for the preservation of endangered birds commits a summary offense punishable on first conviction by a fine of up to $5,000 and/or six months' imprisonment, and on second or later conviction by a fine of up to $20,000 and/or twelve months' imprisonment, but not less than four times the greatest fine imposed on any earlier conviction but not to exceed $50,000.&quot;
<p>
RS, an unemployed forester, had pleaded guilty to the offence under s.8 several months ago, and was fined $1,000, which he gathered with difficulty with the support of friends. He admitted to entering a designated area to find rare eggs that he could sell, illegally, for up to $50 each.
<p>
Following conviction, RS carefully studied lands designated under the Act, and found that a narrow wedge of land in Northern Ontario, in the breeding grounds of some unusual birds, had not been designated.
<p>
RS traveled to the area on April 7th, 1995, marked out the boundaries of the undesignated lands, and proposed to search for eggs the next morning. On that morning, however, his bad back ached too much, so he fished all day by a stream and listened to music on his radio. Unknown to RS, on the afternoon of April 7th, the provincial Minister of Natural Resources had announced that the Ontario Gazette to be released the next day would declare that, from April 9th, 1995, some land omitted by oversight from coverage under the Act would become designated, including that discovered by RS. Late in the afternoon of April 9th, when RS returned to his campsite with eight eggs in a container, he was arrested by two wardens.
<p>
RS has now been charged with the offense contrary to s.8 of the Act.
<p>
Explain the legal grounds on which you would conduct his defense.
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b><blockquote>You have not been given precise wording of the information, and should not address such procedural matters as vaqueness.</blockquote>

1. Jones is a recently escaped convict from Kingston Penitentiary. He manages to get to Toronto and calls on his old partner-in-crime, Smith. Smith had recently been released from Kingston. Jones tells Smith that he wants to shoot the Crown Attorney who most recently
put him behind bars and that if Smith won't drive him to the Crown's
residence, he, Jones, may turn his anger towards Smith. Smith
says he doesn't want to do it. In any event, Smith says, he has
been having serious epileptic fits every few weeks and, moreover,
has been on a dunking binge for the past few days. Jones takes
out a .38 handgun and says, &quot;perhaps this will persuade you.&quot;
Smith then agreed to drive the car.
<P>
When they got to the Crown's residence, Smith acted as a lookout
while Jones entered the house and shot the Crown. Smith helped
him place the body in a trunk, which they carried to the car and
dumped into Lake Ontario. As it turned out, the trunk did not
sink and was recovered by a sailor who discovered that the Crown
was still alive. The sailor pulled the trunk into the boat and
headed for the main dock. Unfortunately, in the panic, a ferry
boat hit the sailboat and the badly wounded Crown, according to
the Coroner, drowned.
<P>
Several weeks later, Jones was spotted by the police in a bar.
He was immediately arrested for escaping from the Penitentiary
and was placed in a cell at the Don Jail awaiting his court appearance.
An undercover officer was placed in the cell next to him. The
police suspected that Jones had been responsible for the Crown's
murder. A witness living next to the Crown had picked out Jones
(from a collection of photographs) as the person he thinks he
saw ringing the Crown's doorbell. During a conversation with Jones,
the undercover officer asked Jones whether he knew what had happened
to the Crown, stories of which had been in the papers for the
past few weeks. Jones said he &quot;could say a lot about it,
but was keeping mum.&quot;
<P>
The police then charged Jones with the first-degree murder of
the Crown. The police warned Jones that he didn't have to say
anything and could get a lawyer if he wanted. Before they could
say anything about legal aid, Jones said he didn't need a lawyer,
as they only make things worse. He then admitted that he was involved.
He hadn't meant to shoot the Crown, he said, but only to scare
him. But the first thing the Crown said was: &quot;You dumb jailbird.
You'll be back in Kingston before you know it.&quot; Jones says
he then instinctively shot the Crown in the chest. Jones also
told the police about Smith's role in the episode.
<P>
The police went to Smith's residence and arrested him for first
degree murder. While there, they looked in a bedroom dresser drawer
and found a watch with the Crown's name engraved on the back.
Smith asked for a lawyer, but on the way to the police station
to meet the lawyer, Smith volunteered, without prompting or questioning, that he was forced to go along with what Jones wanted and, in
any event, he, Smith, couldn't think straight at the time because
of his drinking and his epileptic fits.
<P>
You are an articling student in the Crown Attorney's office in
Toronto. Both Jones and Smith say, through their lawyers, that
they are willing to plead guilty to manslaughter and take their
chances on the sentence. Advise the Crown whether she should accept
the pleas.

2. Assume that the government of Ontario has just passed an Act,
the <cite>Assisting Death Act</cite>. Dr. Green has been treating a
60-year old man, Mr. Frank, who has advanced lung cancer. The
Ontario Act says that &quot;it is legal for a doctor to provide
[certain deadly pills set out by regulation] at the written and
notorized request of any patient who, in the doctor's opinion,
is suffering from a fatal illness and has less than six months
to live.&quot; Another section makes it a summary conviction offence
to assist in causing death in any other manner. The possible penalty
is a fine of $10,000, without the possibility of imprisonment.
<P>
Dr. Green called the Department of Health and asked whether Drug
X was on the list. The Deputy Minister's secretary said that she
had recently seen a regulation adding the drug to the list. Dr.
Green administered the drug intravenously and Mr. Frank died.
Drug X is, in fact, not on the list. The secretary was mistaken.
As it turned out, Dr. Green administered Drug Y (Not Drug X),
which also is not on the permitted list. He had asked for Drug
X, but the pharmacy had given him Drug Y.
<P>
Dr. Green was then charged with &quot;assisting in causing death&quot;
by administering a drug, not on the designated list under the
<cite>Assisting Death Act.</cite> The Crown contends that this is an
absolute liability offence and, in any event, the doctor can't
&quot;administer&quot; the drug, but can only &quot;provide&quot;
it to the patient.
<P>
You are a junior lawyer in Eddie Greenspan's office and have been
asked to prepare a memo on whether Dr. Green will be convicted
under the <cite>Assisting Death Act</cite> and, if prosecuted, whether
he might later have a &quot;double jeopardy&quot; defence or any
other defence to a charge of &quot;aiding or abetting a person
to commit suicide&quot; under s.241(b) of the <cite>Criminal Code.</cite>

You are the Crown attorney responsible for the prosecution of Bernard. Based on the following information, write a memorandum to your file analyzing the evidentiary issues that are likely to arise in the trial.
<p>
One Saturday evening in 1994, at about 11:45 p.m., Bernard boarded a northbound subway train at Queen station. At the next stop (Dundas station), three young men, Jeff, Larry, and Malcolm, boarded the train. What happened next is disputed, but before the train had reached College station, Bernard had shot Malcolm with a .44 calibre handgun. Larry and Bernard got off at College and fled in different directions. Meanwhile, Jeff had pushed the yellow emergency strip. An ambulance arrived and took Malcolm (and Jeff) to Toronto General hospital, where Malcolm died.
<p>
Tuvok is the officer in charge of the investigation into Malcolm's death. By 1:00 a.m., Bernard had been arrested and charged with second degree murder in Malcolm's death. Tuvok properly advised him of his right to counsel and gave him a chance to use a phone. Bernard spoke to duty counsel and declined to say anything to Tuvok. He was then placed in a cell with Paris, a charming, roguish street-level drug dealer who had just been arrested. Paris had had numerous dealings with the police in the past, both as an informer and as an accused. In particular, he had acted as an informant in a successful prosecution some years before. Tuvok had not told Paris anything about Bernard, and had not asked Paris to obtain a statement from Bernard, but he was hoping that Paris's charm would make Bernard open up a bit. Tuvok's plan succeeded. After some preliminary chit-chat, Paris said to Bernard, &quot;So, why don't you tell me how a nice guy like you ended up in a place like this?&quot; The following exchange then occurred:
<dl>
<dt>Bernard: <dd>I was sitting on the subway, minding my own business, when these three young punks approached me, with their hands in their pockets, and asked me for $5. I was really frightened; I thought they were going to kill me. I said, &quot;I don't have any money for you,&quot; whereupon one of them [later identified as Malcolm] took a handgun from under his coat and said, &quot;Maybe now you can find some&quot;. The other two looked surprised, and another one [Jeff] said, &quot;Where did you get that?&quot; We all tried to stop the one with the gun; we were not successful in restraining him, but the gun fell to the floor. I picked up the gun and, seeing [Malcolm] draw a knife, fired in his direction. The bullet must have struck him. At College station, I simply panicked at the thought of having shot someone, so I ran away.
<p>
<dt>Paris: <dd>What made you think they were going to kill you?
<p>
<dt>Bernard: <dd>Well, just last year I was robbed of $50 cash and all my credit cards by three young punks with knives, and in 1993 I was beaten up by two hoods when I was out jogging; they were mad because I wasn't carrying any money. And in 1990 I had my watch stolen at gunpoint just outside the Eaton Centre.
<p>
<dt>Paris: <dd>Did you report any of these offenses to the police?
<p>
<dt>Bernard: <dd>No, of course not. I don't have any insurance, so what's the point? Those guys never solve these property crimes anyway.
<p>
<dt>Paris: <dd>What happened to the gun?
<p>
<dt>Bernard: <dd>I threw it into the Don River.
</dl>
Paris reported this conversation to Tuvok, and a .44 calibre handgun was immediately recovered from the Don. Ballistics experts at the Centre for Forensic Sciences have since determined that the bullet in Malcolm's body came from that gun.
<p>
Early the next day, Tuvok went to Bernard's house and introduced himself to Bernard's wife Adele. Bernard and Adele have been happily married for years. When Tuvok told her that Bernard had been charged with second degree murder, she said, &quot;I'm sure he couldn't have done a thing like that; but if he did, I'm certainly not going to stay with him.&quot; Adele told him that Bernard owned a handgun, &quot;the same as the one Clint Eastwood carries in the 'Dirty Harry' movies&quot;. Tuvok then showed her the gun recovered from the Don River. Adele said that it might be Bernard's gun, but she was not sure.
<p>
That afternoon, Tuvok interviewed Jeff and Larry, and they gave him the following statements. These statements were recorded on audio tape, and at the beginning of each tape, Tuvok can be heard saying to the witnesses, &quot;You are going to tell me the truth, aren't you, because you know that it's a very serious matter to mislead the police in an investigation.&quot;
<p>
Larry says that the three of them were returning to their homes in Scarborough after going to see &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; at the Eaton Centre. He says that they were sitting on the subway, minding their own business, when Bernard approached them and began waving a handgun around, shouting obscenities. The three then got up and Malcolm reached for the yellow strip. Before Malcolm could press the strip, Bernard shot him. Larry says that he fled the scene at College station because he has in the past been hassled by the police for no reason, and he was afraid they would think he had something to do with the shooting.
<p>
Jeff's statement generally supports Larry's, but he recalls the movie as being &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. He says that when they boarded the subway at Dundas, he and Larry sat down, but that Malcolm stood near Bernard and &quot;sort of hovered over him.&quot; He was talking to Larry when he heard Bernard yelling at Malcolm; he then stood up and saw Bernard shoot Malcolm as Malcolm was reaching for the yellow strip. He remained with Malcolm because he was really worried about him.
<p>
Each of Larry and Jeff denies that he was armed. Neither of them saw Malcolm carrying any weapons, either. Tuvok showed Jeff and Larry the gun recovered from the Don, and each said that he had never seen Malcolm carrying it.
<p>
<b>Question 2.</b> (50 marks)
<p><blockquote>
	NOTE:	This question assumes that certain pieces of evidence
		presented in Question 1 are admissible. Please maintain
		that assumption, even if, in answering Question 1, you
		have reached a different conclusion. You will need to
		refer back to the facts presented in Question 1 to answer
		this question.
</blockquote>
You are the judge presiding over Bernard's trial. Defence counsel has advised you that Bernard is not going to testify. Rule on the following questions.
<p>
(i) (15 marks) During his examination in chief, Larry has testified that he saw the butt of a gun protruding from Malcolm's waistband when they left the movie, and that Malcolm, alone, approached Bernard and asked for $5. He has testified that he does not know whether Malcolm drew the gun, but he maintains that Bernard shot Malcolm. Crown counsel has cross-examined Larry on his earlier statement, but Larry has refused to adopt it. Crown counsel wants you to tell the jury that they can consider the earlier statement for its truth; defense counsel submits that the statement should go only to Jeff's credibility. How do you rule?
<p>
(ii) (20 marks) Defence counsel wants to call Dr Selar, a psychiatrist, who will give her opinion that Bernard suffers from &quot;paranoid urban anomie&quot;. According to Dr Selar, people who suffer from this condition tend to perceive any personal contact on the street or on public transit as a physical threat, especially late at night. The greater the number of people who approach, the greater the threat will appear to be. The sufferer will often invent, and then come to believe, a story of threatened assault or attempted robbery to justify his or her response to the perceived threat. Dr Selar has written extensively about this condition and has appeared as an expert in a number of other trials. She has based her opinion on a number of interviews with Bernard, on interviews with Bernard's father and with Adele, and on a standard psychological test. In the interviews, Bernard repeated the statement he gave to Paris. If Dr Selar testifies, the Crown proposes to call Dr Piper, who will testify that the psychiatric community does not recognize &quot;paranoid urban anomie&quot; as a valid diagnosis, that Dr Selar is the only psychiatrist who has ever written on it, and that even if &quot;paranoid urban anomie&quot; does exist, Bernard is not suffering from it. Dr Piper's opinion regarding Bernard is based on Bernard's statement to Paris and on interviews with Adele. Will you permit the jury to hear Dr Selar's and Dr Piper's evidence?
<p>
(iii) (10 marks) Defense counsel has discovered that Malcolm was twice charged with assaulting subway patrons. He was acquitted both times, but defense counsel has located the victims of Malcolm's alleged assaults. Each is prepared to testify that Malcolm robbed them at knife-point on the subway. Crown counsel submits that the alleged victims should not be allowed to testify. How do you rule?
<p>
(iv) (5 marks) Crown counsel has completed her charge to the jury, and has told them that Bernard's gun must have been a .44 calibre, because that is what Clint Eastwood carries in the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; movies. Defence counsel has objected to this statement, because the Crown has not offered any evidence to prove anything about the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; movies. What should you do?

 1. Tom and Jessica met in Ohio in early 1980 when Tom was 27
and Jessica was 25. It was a second marriage for Tom and the first for Jessica.
Tom was divorced in California in 1978. Tom and Jessica fell instantly
in love and moved in together in November of 1980, into a home owned by Tom on Scott
Street in Cleveland. Tom had inherited this home from his grandfather in
1970. In December of 1980 and for at least two years thereafter, it was
worth $200,000.00 (Canadian) and it had a mortgage on it of $60,000.00,
the monies from which Tom had used to pay for his university education. On
September 8, 1982 Jessica announced she was pregnant and the couple made plans
to marry. On December 1, 1982, they married at St. Grace's Church in Cleveland.
Tom and Jessica continued to live in the Scott Street home until the
baby, Martin, was born in July of 1982. In August of 1985, Tom's employer asked
Tom to take an interest in and to head up the Canadian division of Widget Works
Inc. and, thus, Tom and Jessica moved to Toronto to take up permanent residence.
The initially had trouble selling the Scott Street home, but eventually
it sold in December, 1985, for $190,000.00. Tom used the net proceeds of
$140,000.00, (the mortgage had been paid down somewhat) to buy a home on Bilton
Street in Toronto for $210,000.00. Tom guaranteed a mortgage of $70,000.00
to make up the difference in the purchase price. Tom, on the advice of
his U.S. attorney, put the new home in Jessica's name to protect him if the new business
venture failed. On February 1, 1995, the property had a value of $240,000.00
and the mortgage has been paid down to $58,000.00. However, a development
has occurred with respect to the home that troubles Tom. The city
counsel has proposed a rezoning of Bilton Street and the unusual rezoning
proposal will, if it is approved, dramatically increase the value of all of the
properties on the street. Jessica's friend, Amy, a real estate agent, has told Tom
and Jessica that the change will improve the value of the home by $100,000.00.
The vote at city council is expected in about six months and, apparently, council
is narrowly in favour of the rezoning.
<P>
Tom and Jessica had a break-in at the home one year ago and the
damage claim has not yet been settled, but Jessica expects a cheque
shortly for the full amount, less her deductible of $2,000.00.
Some vandals did about $30,000.00 worth of damage while Tom and
Jessica were on a short holiday and Jessica has made a claim on
her home insurance policy. Tom paid for the repairs out of his
savings.
<P>
Tom has an RRSP of $60,000.00 as of February 1, 1995 and Jessica
has a spousal RRSP that Tom paid for of $30,000.00 as of the same
date.
<P>
Since moving to Toronto the Canadian widget business has prospered
and Tom increased his stake in the business to 75% in 1993. At
that time the business had a value of $500,000.00 and has probably
increased by February 1, 1995 to $600,000.00. Because of the success,
Tom is considering buying out the remaining 25% interest which
his partner is willing to sell for $150,000.00.
<P>
Tom had a car worth $8,000.00 and some furnishings worth $3,000.00
at the time of the marriage. He also had a student loan of $16,000.00
at the time of marriage, but he repaid it in March of 1983 when
he received a gift from his father of a $50,000.00 Canada Savings
Bond. Tom used $16,000.00 of that bond to pay down the loan, $5,000.00
for a holiday and $9,000.00 for two skidoos which have long since
been discarded. The balance was used by Tom to purchase an Ontario
Savings long term bond which, with accumulated interest. was worth
$44.000.00 on February 1, 1995.
<P>
In 1991, Tom's father died, leaving Tom the family cottage on
the shores of Lake Woebegone in Ohio. The cottage was worth then
and is worth now $80,000.00 Canadian. Jessica suffers from arachnaphobia
and, thus, has never been there.
<P>
Tom collects antiques and, over the years, has filled the home
with small, but valuable pieces. He believes the antiques in the
home have a value of at least $30,000.00.
<P>
Tom received $60,000.00 of life insurance proceeds from Mutual
Life on the death of his father in 1991. Tom spent $20,000.00
of the insurance monies to build a pool at the matrimonial home
and the balance for a 1994 Lincoln which he registered in Jessica's
name. The car is now worth $28,000.00.
<P>
At the time of marriage, Jessica also had a student loan of $6,000.00.
Jessica was a beneficiary of a trust created by her great grandfather
in 1940 and she was entitled to receive $25,000.00 when she reached
age 30. She also had a diamond pendant given to her by her grandmother
that was valued at $8,000.00.
<P>
Jessica sold the diamond pin in 1984 and used the proceeds to
pay off the student loan and the balance for some orthodonture
work. She received the trust proceeds of $25,000.00 in 1985 and
invested it in the stock market until her chosen stocks increased
in value to $35,000.00 by 1994. In early 1994, she sold the stock,
took the $35,000.00 and bought 2 paintings for the home, each
worth about $17,500.00. Unfortunately, one has turned out to be
a forgery and is worthless and the other is now worth about $20,000.00.
<P>
Jessica, unexpectedly, won $20,000.00 in Lottario last year and
used $12,000.00 for an expensive holiday to Paris and Rome for
her and Tom in a desperate attempt to save the marriage. The balance
is still in her bank account.
<P>
Tom and Jessica now have two children, Martin, aged 12 and Diane,
aged 8. Martin has serious asthma and severe learning disabilities,
but has managed to keep up in school as a result of both parties'
strenuous efforts with him. Diane is in a gifted children's programme
in school and is doing well there.
<P>
Jessica was studying at Art School when she married and hoped
to be an art therapist upon graduation. As a result of Martin's
health problems, she did not complete her last 6 courses and never
graduated. She would like to do so, but it would now require her
to go back to school for at least two years. Upon graduation,
she would have reasonable prospects for employment starting at
about $30,000.00 per year. She has occasionally helped Tom at
his office and has been very active entertaining his clients and
business executives.
<P>
Tom earns about $120,000.00 per year, plus some benefits. He is
a devoted father, but he has allowed the pressures of work to
interfere with the time he has had for both children and for Jessica.
This has become a significant source of tension in the home. In
her loneliness last year, Jessica turned elsewhere and had an
affair with a neighbour. She was guilt ridden about it and confessed
it instantly to Tom. Tom was devastated. Try as he might, he could
not put it behind him and the parties' relationship deteriorated
drastically. Tom decided that there must be an immediate separation
and that Jessica should move out and leave Tom and the nanny to
look after the children. The nanny is also angry at Jessica and
has apparently sided with Tom. She has been with the family for
6 years. When Jessica would not move out, Tom moved to a separate
bedroom on February 1, 1995 and has remained in the home, but
has clearly been living separate and apart from Jessica in the
home since that date. Martin has indicated he would prefer living
with Tom and Diane has not voiced a preference. Jessica says Tom
has been pressuring Martin and plying him with gifts.
<P>
Jessica is determined to have custody of the children and, in
view of Tom's rigid stance, does not believe that cooperation
with him is possible. She is sick of Tom's accusations and, unfortunately,
is in a fighting mood. She no longer sees any hope for reconciliation.
<P>
Jessica has come to see you and has asked the following questions.
Because her uncle is a lawyer in Ottawa, she wishes you to give
her a detailed, written response so that she can show your reasoning
to her uncle.
<P>
<b>The suggested time for dealing with the following questions is

60% 1. The government of Nordia, a country that resembles Canada
in most respects, enacts the Worker Solidarity Act. The Act is
apparently attended to encourage companies to engage in progressive
labour practices, particularly worker ownership or worker participation
on boards of directors. A subsidy per worker of a thousand dollars
per year is offered to any company that undertakes such innovations
in labour relations. In order to be eligible to receive the subsidy
a company must be certified by a government agency (the Worker
Participation Board or WPB) to have made sufficient adjustments
to its labour relations practices. As well, the Worker Solidarity
Act provides that any Nordian company that undertakes to purchase
imported goods only from countries that have labour laws permitting
or encouraging worker participation is entitled to a rebate of
any customs duty paid on those imports. So far, although the subsidy
is available in theory to any industry or firm in the economy,
the Worker Participation Board has only certified companies in
the widget industry as eligible (this is an industry until recently
in decline which has engaged in major restructuring, with worker
share ownership a significant ingredient in the restructuring).
With respect to the duty rebate, 15 countries have been formally
listed by the WPB as qualifying because their labour laws permit
or encourage worker participation (for the most part, European
countries that have responded to a complex questionnaire provided
by the WPB). The Act also states that any company found to be
purchasing any imported goods manufactured in any country that
does not respect &quot;basic international worker's rights and
environmental norms&quot; will be disqualified henceforth from
receiving a subsidy. Finally, where a country is found to &quot;repeatedly
and systematically repress free collective bargaining&quot; the
WBP may recommend to the Minister of International Trade that
all imports from that country into Nordia be prohibited. So far
this recommendation has been made twice. In both instances, no
prohibition was in fact instituted, since the countries in question
voluntarily undertook to improve labour practices, as well as
agreeing to limit by quotas exports to Nordia of products competing
with Canadian firms in &quot;sensitive&quot; sectors.
<P>
Consider any trade law concerns about the Worker Solidarity Act
that Nordia's trade partners might wish to raise.
<P>
40% 2. &quot;Today, sustaining rule-based global trade increasingly
requires harmonization or adjustment of what have traditionally
been understood as domestic policies. We face the choice of either
going forward towards a world political and economic community,
with common policies in a wide range of regulatory areas, or reverting
to wide-scale unilateral protectionism and beggarthy-neighbour
regulatory competition.&quot;
<P>
Discuss this proposition, in reflecting on any two of the following
areas of international trade law discussed in class:
<P>
Subsidies and Countervailing duties<br>
Trade, transition costs and labour policies<br>
Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights<br>
Trade in Services<br>
Trade and Environment

You are chairing a board created to arbitrate a grievance between
Pound Press Ltd. and Local 701 of the United Printers of America
The grievor is Ron Broder. The written grievance, filed with the
board at the opening of the hearing, reads: &quot;On December
2, the foreman ordered me to work through my lunch break and over
the Employment Standards Act limit. I left because I don't have
to do that. I want my job back and full pay and seniority.&quot;
The Pound Press third step reply, also filed with the board, reads:
&quot;The foreman asked Broder to stay on the job until relief
came. Broder refused, said he was quitting, and left the plant.
Since he voluntarily terminated his employment, he has no grievance.
<P>
After the formal grievance and the reply have been filed, counsel
to Pound Press says that the employer will defend the grievance,
not only on the ground of voluntary termination but also on the
ground that, if Broder did not quit, he was discharged for just
cause. Counsel to the union objects to the addition of the new
ground because, he argues, neither Pound Press nor its counsel
had earlier said that Broder had been discharged. Counsel to Pound
Press agrees that the alternative ground had not been mentioned
earlier.
<P>
Complete with reasons, set out the board's ruling responding to
the objection to Pound Press Ltd.'s proposal to defend on the
alternative ground.
<P>
<hr><p>
<center>II<br>(60 minutes)</center>
<P>
Without prejudice to what you set out in part I, assume that the
board has decided that Pound Press Ltd. may defend the grievance
on both grounds. Also assume that the facts set out below were
shown by the evidence introduced at the hearing. Deft the elaborated
award you conclude should be issued to determine the grievance.
<P>
Broder was hired in September 1990 and has been employed as a
packer on the day shift ever since. He has been a reasonably efficient
worker. Before the incident involved in this grievance, he had
been disciplined twice. He was given a written warning in April
1992 for coming in late twice in two weeks. And he was suspended
for one day without pay in January 1994 for careless packing resulting
in damage to a shipment. He did not grieve either time.
<P>
Early on the evening of December 1st, Leno Cevick, Broder's foreman,
telephoned him at his home telling him to report for work the
following morning at 7:30 a.m. instead of at the usual starting
time. A rush order for an important customer was being printed
that night and it had to be ready for shipping early the next
day. Situations like this had come up previously and, in Broder's
experience, packing of rush orders starting at 7:30 a.m. was usually
completed by noon.
<P>
On December 2nd, Broder and two other packers began the work at
7:30 a.m. Cevick told them that &quot;this is a rush order; you
must keep at it until it's ready to go out&quot;. The three packers
worked without a break but, since the order was bigger than Broder
had expected from experience, they were still not finished at
half-past twelve. At that moment Broder walked out of the shipping
room to retrieve his lunch pail from his locker. Seeing Broder
leave, Cevick ordered him to stay at the job until he (Cevick)
got someone else to fill in. Broder replied in an angry tone,
&quot;Nuts to that! It's past my lunch time. Why should I work
in this damned place if I can't eat?&quot; Cevick walked away
in the opposite direction without replying. Broder went to his
locker, put on his coat, took his lunch pail and went home. Within
ten minutes of the exchange with Broder, Cevick had arranged for
another packer to take over Broder's job on the rush order until
he had eaten lunch. Cevick looked for Broder in the plant, but
of course Broder was no longer there.
<P>
Cevick reported what had happened to the personnel office. In
mid-afternoon of December 2nd the personnel manager telephoned
Broder's home and told him that, since he had quit, he should
not come back to work. Several days later, Broder got in the mail
a cheque sent by the personnel office covering his pay for the
last days as well as accumulated vacation benefits. On Monday,
December 5th, Broder put in his formal grievance. Section 22 of
the Employment Standards Act says that &quot;[e]very employer
shall provide eating periods...at such intervals as will result
in no employee working longer than five consecutive hours without
an eating period...&quot;. Section 78 of the Act authorizes a
fine or imprisonment for violating any provision.

Truro Auto Parts (TAP) is a manufacturer of car parts supplying
the major auto manufacturers in Ontario. It is a subsidiary of
a large U.S. auto parts firm. The Canadian Autoworkers (CAW) has
represented some 400 or so hourly paid production workers for
many years. The current collective agreement expires in 1996.
The plant works on a 3 shift, 24 hour, 7 days a week basis. Cito
Gasket is Human Resources Manager at the plant which is located
in Peterborough.
<P>
On advice of lawyers to its unorganized U.S. parent company, TAP
has recently announced that it will undertake measures to ensure
that it is complying with the Ontario Human Rights Code &quot;duty
to accommodate&quot; the various religious observance requirements
of the numerous religious groups represented in its workforce.
To this end it recently announced its intention to &quot; re-engineer&quot;
unilaterally the shift scheduling so as to accommodate these various
requirements. The collective agreement sets out the hours of the
various shifts and permits people to bid for the shift of their
choice based on seniority.
<P>
This move takes the CAW by surprise because the topic of religious
accommodation had been discussed during the last negotiations,
without ultimate success, but on the understanding that the matter
would be referred to a standing joint union/management committee
that has been in existence for years and whose purpose it is to
act as a place for discussion of issues of mutual concern during
the term of the collective agreement. (The collective agreement
provides for the setting up of the committee and also has a standard
management rights clause.)
<P>
As part of the plan TAP has circulated a questionnaire to employees
asking them to identify themselves as members of various religious
groups with special scheduling requirements.
<P>
The Union executive holds a meeting to respond to this management
initiative and to discuss strategy. They decide to tell the membership
not to fill out the questionnaire. They also decide to file a
grievance again &quot;management's insensitive and unilateral
actions&quot;.
<P>
The Union also takes their complaint about management's actions
to the next meeting of the Joint Union/Management Committee. At
that meeting Cito Gasket expressed some sympathy with the view
that perhaps management's actions were a bit sudden and undertook
to put the issue on the agenda for the next meeting of the Committee
as a priority item. Cito was fired the next day.
<P>
On the other hand, several union members have decided to fill
out the questionnaire and have, as a result, been fined under
the Union's constitution for contravening a provision that prohibits
&quot;actions designed to undermine union solidarity&quot;. This
action was approved at a lively union meeting by a majority vote.
These workers refuse to pay the Union fine and as a result are
expelled for such non-payment from the Union in accordance with
the union constitution. The collective agreement contains the
standard and required &quot;Rand Formula&quot; provision.
<P>
Meanwhile the Union has taken its grievance through the &quot;expedited&quot;
arbitration process set out in s. 46 of the Act and received a
quick decision from the arbitrator appointed by the Minister thereunder.
That arbitrator dismissed the grievance stating: &quot;This grievance
is a bad idea. What has this Union got against human rights? And
besides, haven't they read <CITE>Russelsteel</CITE>?&quot; Upon
receiving this decision, the day shift holds a spontaneous &quot;study
session&quot; to review the arbitrator's award and discuss its
impact. Production for that shift is lost.
<P>
ADVISE the Union, the Employer, and the employees identified about
their rights and obligations arising from these facts. In so doing,
describe fully and critically evaluate the legal predicaments
in which they find themselves.

1. Your client writes to you asking for your opinion and
advice:
<P>
Three years ago this month we applied for a Canadian Patent
for our SUPERBAG plastic bag. Last November we got our Canadian
patent. The claims and some of the drawings are attached.
<P>
The patent uses fancy patent language but what I meant to
patent was our grocery bag that comes with its sides all folded
inward (the patent calls it Inwardly gussetted&quot; which I think
is an OK description, just a little fancy). These things come
to the customer (like Loblaws) in a stack and they attach the
upper thingamajig (you called it the Separable support members
26) to a bracket and then you just tear off a bag each time you
need one. The outside pieces 28 and 30 become the ban's handles.
<P>
The claims also talk about our neat tearing system where the
handles are held to the &quot;separable support members 26 by
way of two ittybitty pieces of bag 36 and 38, on each side. The
patent calls them Spaced apart contact members&quot;.
<P>
I just found out Bags are Delightful (&quot;BAD&quot;) has
been making a bag like ours and selling it in Canada. There's
a drawing of their bag enclosed. It looks just like ours only
it just has regular perforations 30 between the side handles 18
and 26 and the separable support member 22  just like a tear line

<b>QUESTION ONE (64 MARKS) - 90 MINUTES</b>
<P>
In 1990 Alice Bronson was the sole owner of a retail personal
computer business operating out of a store on Spadina Avenue.
With her lease about to expire in a few months, and the landlord
not wanting to renew it, she consulted a commercial real estate
agency. They told her about a new mall opening in the expanding
community of Suburbis, 15 miles north of Toronto. The mall was
completed with space for 30 stores, although at that time only
15 tenants had moved in. She called the mall owner, who said:
&quot;drive out and look at the place. When you get here park
in the section of the parking lot closest to the main entrance
to the mall. It's marked 'reserved for owner'. I park there and
I also let my tenants park there. Use the space numbered 16&quot;.
Alice did as she was instructed, liked the mall, and liked the
fact also that it had no personal computer store.
<P>
Over a few meetings she was able to hammer out a good deal with
the owner, who was keen to have her as a tenant because he saw
a computer store as an attraction that would increase the number
of people who visited the mall. In one of the meetings Alice asked
about parking for customers, and was told that the lot was big
enough that it was never full. She took care to drive out to the
place at different times, and confirmed this fact for herself.
<P>
The 10-year lease contained covenants standard in mall leases,
including one that read: &quot;The tenant covenants to operate
continuously a store for the sale of personal computer products.&quot;
<P>
On January 1, 1991, Alice took possession of the premises, and
shortly afterwards opened for business. She had been given one
of the best locations in the mall, store number 23, one that had
an entrance right onto the parking lot and that therefore could
advertise its presence very effectively. She did very well for
over three years, although the mall itself was never entirely
successful. At various times between 1991 and 1994 between 5 and
8 of the 30 store spaces were unrented. As a result the owner
was barely able to make a profit given his large interest payments.
In an effort to get more revenue he agreed to lease about half
of the land used as the mall parking lot to a neighbouring office
building, which did not have enough parking.
<P>
Thus when Alice turned up one morning in August 1994 she found
half the parking lot cordoned off with temporary fencing, with
just the portion of it nearest to the mall left for mall parking.
She could still park in what used to be the reserved area, but
the reserved signs and the numbers were gone and the area given
over to general parking. As things turned out this made things
quite difficult for her, because she or an employee used her car
a lot during the day to collect products and make deliveries,
and doing so took much longer once she no longer had a reserved
parking space. Even worse, she quickly discovered that the remaining
parking lot was often full. Not only was she forced sometimes
to wait before being able to park, but trade dropped off substantially
as potential customers refused to wait and went elsewhere. By
the end of 1994 she was actually losing money, sales not covering
rent, wages, and other expenses.
<P>
Discussions with the mall owner being unavailing, Alice decided
to consult a lawyer. She chose your articling principal who passed
the file to you, with this note:
<P>
&quot;If I remember my first year property course correctly, this
is the kind of thing covered by easement law. Surely Ms. Bronson
has a right to use the landlord's land for parking, which means
she has the right both to the reserved space she used to have
and to have enough parking for her customers. If I'm wrong about
this, is there anything we can do for her using landlord and tenant
law?&quot;
<P>
<b>QUESTION 1 - PART A (32 MARKS - 45 MINUTES):</b> Please write
a memo in response.
<P>
Being keen you complete this memo quickly, but it then sits on
your principal's desk because she is on vacation. In the meantime
matters deteriorated for Alice, and she decided to cut her losses.
She packed up all her goods on the evening of February 26th 1995
and departed; the next day she cancelled the March rent cheque
and all subsequent rent cheques, and delivered a letter to the
mall owner which stated, in part: &quot;You have broken our agreement
by not providing enough parking. So I'm breaking it too by leaving.
You can have your stupid mall.&quot; She was not the only one
to feel this way. At the time she left there were a total of 10
stores empty in the mall.
<P>
A couple of weeks later she received a letter from the landlord's
solicitors, which read:
<P>
&quot;Re: Suburbis Mall and Alice Bronson. This is to inform you
that the owner of Suburbis Mall does not consider your lease to
be surrendered. We will be looking to you for payment of the rent
for the remaining period of the lease, until 31 December 2000.
We intend also to hold you responsible for losses occasioned by
your failure to operate a computer retail operation in store number 23&quot;
<P>
Alice again consults your firm. Your principal is still on vacation,
so you interview her. In the meeting she says:
<P>
&quot;Surely this is ridiculous. Surely the law won't make me
pay to the year 2000. Anyway, I happen to know that a friend of
mine, who runs a clothing business, wants to move into my store.
She thinks she can do all right even with the limited parking
for customers as most of her clients are kids who have to go to
the mall on public transit anyway. But the landlord won't give
her that store, he says she must take one of the other empty ones.
She doesn't really want one of those, although she'll take it
if necessary; she really wants the one that faces the parking
lot.&quot;
<P>
<b>QUESTION ONE - PART B (32 MARKS - 45 MINUTES):</b> Please advise
Alice about her legal position.
<P>
<b>QUESTION TWO - 36 MARKS - 45 MINUTES</b>
<P>
Your client Mr. Thoreau owns a substantial piece of forested property
in prime cottage country. He has not built on the lot, but has
cut trails through the forest and cleared picnic/camp sates at
several places. Every year, for a number of years, he and his
family have spent time there in the summer. They camp, wander
the trails, and observe nature. They also made a habit of pruning
back the growth where the trails and sites had become overgrown
and replacing any missing trail markers. Over the years Mr. Thoreau
has been approached by property developers, who wanted to buy
the land and sub-divide and develop it as cottage properties.
[The developers know that there will be no problem with planning
legislation]. Mr. Thoreau has always resisted such offers.
<P>
Mr. Thoreau has one son, now 30, and has always assumed that the
land would eventually go to the son. But he is now worried by
the fact that his son wants to &quot;get on&quot;, make some money,
and thinks that the son might be tempted to sell the land to one
of the developers. He is very concerned that this not happen.
His worries about this have increased recently, because his own
health is deteriorating and he does not find it easy to keep fixing
up the trails and sites. His son has suggested that, since Thoreau
is having these problems, and since the son will get it eventually
anyway, he should sell the land to him now. Mr. Thoreau is not
opposed to the idea in principle, indeed he thinks it would be
good to have more cash on hand. But that nagging concern about
his son's intentions remains with him.
<P>
Mr. Thoreau comes to your office with this story. He does want
the land to go to his son, and he is Indifferent about whether
this happens before or after his (Thoreau's) death. But he also
wants to ensure, in his words, that &quot;the property will be
maintained in all its natural beauty&quot; He asks you whether
it is possible to do this at all, and if so whether he could achieve
it better by selling the land to his-son now or leaving it to
his son in his will. Please advise him

<b>QUESTION ONE (50 MARKS) - 90 MINUTES</b><p>
In 1990 Alice Bronson was the sole owner of a retail personal computer business operating out of a store on Spadina Avenue. With her lease about to expire in a few months, and the landlord not wanting to renew it, she consulted a commercial real estate agency. They told her about a new mall opening in the expanding community of Suburbis, 15 miles north of Toronto. The mall was completed with space for 30 stores, although at that time only 15 tenants had moved in. She called the mall owner, who said: &quot;drive out and look at the place. When you get here park in the section of the parking lot closest to the main entrance to the mall. It's marked 'reserved for owner'. I park there and I also let my tenants park there. Use the space numbered 16&quot;. Alice did as she was instructed, liked the mall, and liked the fact also that it had no personal computer store.
<p>
Over a few meetings she was able to hammer out a good deal with the owner, who was keen to have her as a tenant because he saw a computer store as an attraction that would increase the number of people who visited the mall. In one of the meetings Alice asked about parking for customers, and was told that the lot was big enough that it was never full. She took care to drive out to the place at different times and confirmed this fact for herself.
The 10-year lease contained covenants standard in mall leases, including one that read: &quot;The tenant covenants to operate continuously a store for the sale of personal computer products.&quot;
<p>
On January 1, 1991, Alice took possession of the premises, and shortly afterwards opened for business. She had been given one of the best locations in the mall, store number 23, one that had an entrance right onto the parking lot and that therefore could advertise its presence very effectively. She did very well for over three years, although the mall itself was never entirely successful. At various times between 1991 and 1994 between 5 and 8 of the 30 store spaces were unrented. As a result the owner was barely able to make a profit given his large interest payments. In an effort to get more revenue he agreed to lease about half of the land used as the mall parking lot to a neighbouring office building, which did not have enough parking.
<p>
Thus when Alice turned up one morning in August 1994 she found half the parking lot cordoned off with temporary fencing, with just the portion of it nearest to the mall left for mall parking. She could still park in what used to be the reserved area, but the reserved signs and the numbers were gone and the area given over to general parking. As things turned out this made things quite difficult for her, because she or an employee used her car a lot during the day to collect products and make deliveries, and doing so took much longer once she no longer had a reserved parking space. Even worse, she quickly discovered that the remaining parking lot was often full. Not only was she forced sometimes to wait before being able to park, but trade dropped off substantially as potential customers refused to wait and went elsewhere. By the end of 1994 she was actually losing money, sales not covering rent, wages, and other expenses.
<p>
Discussions with the mall owner being unavailing, Alice decided to consult a lawyer. She chose your articling principal who passed the file to you, with this note:
<p>
&quot;If I remember my first year property course correctly, this is the kind of thing covered by easement law. Surely Ms. Bronson has a right to use the landlord's land for parking, which means she has the right both to the reserved space she used to have and to have enough parking for her customers. If I'm wrong about this, is there anything we can do for her using landlord and tenant law?&quot;
<p>
<b>QUESTION 1 - PART A (25 MARKS - 45 MINUTES):</b> Please write a memo In response.
<p>
Being keen you complete this memo quickly, but it then sits on your principal's desk because she is on vacation. In the meantime matters deteriorated for Alice, and she decided to cut her losses. She packed up all her goods on the evening of February 26th 1995 and departed; the next day she cancelled the March rent cheque and all subsequent rent cheques, and delivered a letter to the mall owner which stated, in part: &quot;You have broken our agreement by not providing enough parking. So I'm breaking it too by leaving. You can have your stupid mall.&quot; She was not the only one to feel this way. At the time she left there were a total of 10 stores empty in the mall.
A couple of weeks later she received a letter from the landlord's solicitors, which read:
<p>
&quot;Re: Suburbis Mall and Alice Bronson. This is to inform you that the owner of Suburbis Mall does not consider your lease to be surrendered. We will be looking to you for payment of the rent for the remaining period of the lease, until 31 December 2000. We intend also to hold you responsible for losses occasioned by your failure to operate a computer retail operation in store number 23&quot;. Alice again consults your firm. Your principal is still on vacation, so you interview her. In the meeting she says:
<p>
&quot;Surely this is ridiculous. Surely the law won't make me pay to the year 2000. Anyway, I happen to know that a friend of mine, who runs a clothing business, wants to move into my store. She thinks she can do all right even with the limited parking for customers as most of her clients are kids who have to go to the mall on public transit anyway. But the landlord won't give her that store, he says she must take one of the other empty ones. She doesn't really want one of those, although she'll take it if necessary; she really wants the one that faces the parking lot.&quot;
<p>
<b>QUESTION ONE - PART B (25 MARKS - 45 MINUTES):</b> Please advise Alice about her legal position.
<P>
<b>QUESTION TWO - 30 MARKS - 55 MINUTES</b>
<p>
Your client Mr. Thoreau owns a substantial piece of forested property in prime cottage country. He has not built on the lot, but has cut trails through the forest and cleared picnic/camp sites at several places. Every year, for a number of years, he and his family have spent time there in the summer. They camp, wander the trails, and observe nature. They also made a habit of pruning back the growth where the trails and sites had become overgrown and replacing any missing trail markers. Over the years Mr. Thoreau has been approached by property developers, who wanted to buy the land and sub-divide and develop it as cottage properties. [The developers know that there will be no problem with planning legislation]. Mr. Thoreau has always resisted such offers.
<p>
Mr. Thoreau has one son, now 30, and has always assumed that the land would eventually go to the son. But he is now worried by the fact that his son wants to &quot;get on&quot;, make some money, and thinks that the son might be tempted to sell the land to one of the developers. He is very concerned that this not happen. His worries about this have increased recently, because his own health is deteriorating and he does not find it easy to keep fixing up the trails and sites. His son has suggested that, since Thoreau is having these problems, and since the son will get it eventually anyway, he should sell the land to him now. Mr. Thoreau is not opposed to the idea in principle, indeed he thinks it would be good to have more cash on hand. But that nagging concern about his son's intentions remains with him.
<p>
Mr. Thoreau comes to your office with this story. He does want the land to go to his son, and he is indifferent about whether this happens before or after his (Thoreau's) death. But he also wants to ensure, in his words, that &quot;the property will be maintained in all its natural beauty&quot;. He asks you whether it is possible to do this at all, and if so whether he could achieve it better by selling the land to his son now or leaving it to his son in his will. Please advise him.
 <p>
<b>QUESTION THREE - 20 MARKS - 35 MINUTES</b>
<p>
Please answer any two (2) of the following questions.
<p>
A) What is the consequence of severing a joint tenancy? How can it be done?
<p>
B) In <cite>Treloar v. Nute</cite> Pennycuick J. said: &quot;The law ... is that if a squatter takes possession of land belonging to another and remains in possession for 12 years to the exclusion of the owner that represents adverse possession and accordingly at the end of the 12 years the owner's title is extinguished. That is the plain meaning of the statutory provisions...&quot;. Is this the law in Ontario? [Consider matters other than the different limitation period].
<p>
C) The current law in Ontario is that neither rent controls nor the granting of security of tenure to residential tenants represent a taking of property from the landlord. Briefly outline the arguments you would make if asked to say why either of these should be considered a taking.
<p>
D) In <cite>Re Gatti et al and Forsythe et al</cite> Goodearle D.C.J. stated that the question at issue was: &quot;Can the owner of residential premises dispossess tenants in preparation for a bona fide sale to third parties in the open market&quot;. What is the answer? What should be the answer?

 <b>Q1. [25 marks] </B>Alan owned a large farm in Ontario. On the northern half
of the property, hereinafter called &quot;Northacre&quot;, were
Alan's house and the farm buildings. Near the southern limit of
Northacre, the land sloped sharply downwards to the southern half
of the farm, hereinafter called &quot;Southacre&quot;. Southacre
sloped gradually towards the south, until it reached a creek at
its southern limit. To the east of Southacre was Eastacre, owned
by Brian. Eastacre was higher land than Southacre, and, near its
southern limit, sloped steeply towards Southacre. Across the creek
to the south of Southacre and Eastacre, the land rose again, to
a small hilltop. The local electricity utility had its transmission
line running over the hilltop. From there, Alan, at his own expense,
constructed a power cable feeding from that line to his farm.
Alan's cable passed about sixty feet over Southacre, to a tower
on Northacre, and then to the buildings on Northacre, to supply
them with power.
<P>
Surface water drained naturally from Northacre and Eastacre onto
Southacre. It did not flow in any defined channels. Alan had constructed
drains on Southacre, which carried water draining from Northacre,
and from the northern part of Eastacre, south to discharge into
the creek. He had never constructed any drains to carry off surface
water draining from the southern part of Eastacre onto Southacre,
with the result that a couple of hectares at the south-east corner
of Southacre were swampy.
<P>
A few years ago, Alan granted a five-year lease of Southacre to
Carol, who, to Alan's knowledge, wished to raise an exotic animal,
the heffalump. Heffalumps require extraordinary amounts of water.
Carol constructed a large farm pond by excavating near the northern
limit of Southacre. The pond was filled by diverting some of the
drains existing on Southacre, so that they discharged into the
new pond. This work was done with Alan's permission. By agreement
between Alan and Carol, incorporated as a term of the lease, a
power line was strung from the tower on Northacre to the house
trailer which Carol had moved onto Southacre, and in which she
proposed to live, Carol agreed to pay Alan a flat fee for her
electricity.
<P>
The heffalumps thrived, and, near the end of the lease, Carol
bought Southacre from Alan. As the existence of the private power
line over Southacre to Northacre had not been mentioned to either
of the parties' lawyers, the deed from Alan to Carol did not refer
to it. It simply conveyed the fee simple in Southacre. Carol continued
to make payments for power to Alan, and, after David bought Alan's
land, to David, as before.
<P>
After the conveyance of the fee simple in Southacre to Carol,
Alan sold Northacre to David. David decided that he too would
raise heffalumps. To obtain a necessary reserve of water, David
built a pond on Northacre. To fill it, he built an embankment
along the south limit of Northacre, retaining on that parcel much
of the water that had previously flowed onto Southacre. The water
level in Carol's pond soon started dropping, as the drainage from
Northacre, which was the main source of its. supply, was cut off.
Carol protested to David that, if he continued to impede the drainage,
she would have to spend large sums either in pumping water from the creek
at the south all the way to the north of her property, or in digging
additional wells. David told her that that was her problem.
<P>
Meanwhile, Carol wished to reclaim the swampy land at the south-east
corner of Southacre. To do so, she built an embankment near the
eastern limit of her property, to throw back onto Eastacre most
of the surface water which had previously drained down into the
swamp area. Brian protested that, during the spring melt and run-off,
this caused the basement of his house, which stood near the line
between the properties, to flood. Carol told him that that was
his problem.
<P>
Then Carol, furious with David, installed her own power generator,
disconnected herself from the power she had previously been receiving
from Northacre, and ordered David to remove the private cable
passing over Southacre, from the electricity utility's line, to
Northacre.
<P>
<B>Carol now consults you. She wants to sue David, to require
him to either restore the drainage of water from Northacre, or
pay the costs of obtaining an alternative supply, and to make
him remove the power cable. Brian is threatening to sue her for
the damage caused to his house by the flooding, and she wants
to defend that suit. Advise Carol</B>
<P>
 <b>Q2. [23 marks]</B> A report of the Law Commission of the United Kingdom, written
in 1984, contained the following passage:
<blockquote>
  &quot;A covenant amounts simply to a contractual obligation
undertaken in a deed by one person towards another; and the general principles of contract law apply to it. As a result it can of
course be enforced between the original covenantor and the original convenantee. On their deaths, the burden and the benefit, normally pass automatically to their respective personal representatives. And it is usually possible by assignment to transfer the benefit, though not the burden to some third party.....&quot;
<P>
  However, the last word is not said on all covenants by the law
of contract. Land law has something to add...&quot;
</blockquote>
<B>Discuss the manner in which &quot;land law&quot; adds to &quot;the
general principles of contract law&quot; with respect to covenants,
with particular reference to the policy reasons underlying such
addition or additions, and the controls which &quot;land law&quot;
puts into place to keep such additions within the scope of the
underlying policy reasons.</B>
<P>
 <b>Q3. [18 marks]</B> In a passage in the case of <cite>Williams v. Hensman,</cite>
the judge referred to three methods of severing a joint tenancy. This passage (reproduced
at p. F-38 of your materials) is sometimes referred to as containing the &quot;three
rules&quot; of that case.
<P>
<B>Discuss how and why this passage would guide your investigation
of the facts, if you were consulted by a client who had a material
interest in having a court find that a joint tenancy had been
severed prior to the death of one of the joint tenants.</B>
<P>
<b>Q4. [17 marks] Discuss how the common law concept of aboriginal, or native, title
to land compares to the common law concept of estates in land
held by tenure from the Crown.</b>
<P>
<b>Q5. [17 marks]</b> You are practicing law in a jurisdiction which has the same
common law with respect to property, and the same relevant statute
law, as the Province of Ontario, <b>except that</b> your
jurisdiction has no common law or statute law involving perpetuities.
<P>
What is the nature and effect of each of the following limitations
of real property, assuming that, in each case, the grantor or
testator owned a fee simple absolute, free of encumbrances? Do
<b>not</b> assume that any person to whom an interest is given
is dead at the creation of the interest.
<dl>
 <dt>(a) a grant: <dd>To T and her heirs, in trust for my son John for
John's lifetime, and then in trust for the first daughter of John to marry.
<P>
<dt>(b) a grant: <dd>To Z for the term of 20 years and then to the eldest
child of Z living at the expiration of Z's term, in fee simple.
<P>
<dt>(c) a devise: <dd>To my wife Wilma for life, and then to my son John
and his heirs, if John attains 18, provided that if John should at any time
after attaining 18 become a citizen of a country other than Canada, John's interest in the said lands will cease, and pass to my daughter Mary and her heirs.
<P>
<dt>(d) a grant: <dd>To the City of Toronto, to be held by the City during
such time as the lands are maintained by the City as a public park and botanical garden. Upon the lands being diverted to any other use, the lands shall pass to the University of Toronto.
<P>
<dt>(e) a grant: <dd>Unto and to the use of T and his heirs in trust for X and his heirs when X marries, or, if X dies unmarried, in trust for Y and his heirs.
