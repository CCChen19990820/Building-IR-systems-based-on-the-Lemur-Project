<H2>The Ultimate Employee Handbook -- A Workshop</h2>
<H3>Workshop Discussion Thread</h3>

Over the next few weeks, lawyers on 
<A HREF="http://www.counsel.com/about.htm">LEXIS&#174 Counsel Connect<font
size=-2><tt>(TM)</tt></font></A>, the largest online communications network for
lawyers are participating in a special workshop devoted to a discussion of what
makes a good employee handbook. You are invited to "listen in" on the discussion
here, and <a href=/download/seminars/form2.html>submit proposed
questions</a> to the participants. Here is the introduction to the seminar as
posted online for the lawyers on Counsel Connect:<p>

From: Cloyd Laporte, III -- Counsel Connect - New York<br>
Date: Mon Jan 15 08:54:02 1996<br>
Subject: Welcome to the Workshop<p>

Welcome to our latest workshop -- The Ultimate Employee Handbook! As the
name suggests, over the next three weeks, we will explore what goes into
a well-constructed employee handbook. We will start by considering what
should -- and what should not -- be included in a handbook, and why. We
will then move on to discuss particular handbook language.<p>

Of course, we do not expect agreement on all of the elements that make
up the "Ultimate" employee handbook. In fact, one thing our panelists
will probably agree on is that there is no, single model for the "best"
employee handbook. This is definitely not an area where "one size fits
all." A large, multinational company is likely to have different needs
from a small company. It is our hope, however, that some common elements
will emerge that will help our audience craft useful handbooks for their
clients.<p>

We have put together an excellent panel of experts on the subject of
employee handbooks. But like other seminars on Counsel Connect,
audience participation is encouraged.<p>

There is one major difference between this workshop, and other seminars
you may have taken part in on Counsel Connect that you should be
aware of: The transcript of this workshop will be posted daily to the
Small Business Law Center on the Court TV Law Center on the Internet's
World Wide Web. What this means is that if you make a comment in this
workshop, it will be available not only to Counsel Connect
members, but also to any one who visits the Small Business Law Center on
the Web. <I>We recognize that there may be some comments that you would
like to make that you would prefer be made anonymously -- at least for
the public transcript we place on the Internet</i>. If so, simply
indicate in your message that you want any personal identifying
information stripped from your comment before we post it to the Court TV
web site. If you have any questions about this, please call me
(800-455-4354) or <A HREF="mailto:claporte@counsel.com">email me</a>,
and I will try to answer. I also welcome any comments you may have.<p>

We're glad to have you aboard, and we hope you enjoy the workshop.<p>

<H2>The Ultimate Employee Handbook -- A Workshop</h2>

<H3>Workshop Discussion Thread</h3>

From: Cloyd Laporte, III -- Counsel Connect - New York<br>
Date: Mon Jan 15 08:57:05 1996<br>
Subject: Why have a handbook?<p>

Last Append: Sun Jan 21 22:57:06 1996<p>

We are about to spend the next three weeks discussing what should
be contained in a good employee handbook or employee policy
manual. As we begin, I would like to ask our panelists why they
think it is a good idea for employers to go to the effort to
create a written employee handbook. Are there good reasons to
have one and not-so-good reasons, and are these reasons important
for lawyers to communicate when advising clients about handbooks?
Does anyone think there is a threshold company size, below which
a handbook is unnecessary?<p>

Subject: Why have a handbook?<p>

Businesses that try to improve the quality of their products find
out that one of the key impediments to success is the lack of
good communications. Much of the work of the "TQM" (quality)
consultants consists of figuring ways to improve communications
about a business process. One example of the importance of
communications is in the area of employee relations. Employees
perform best when they know what is expected of them, when they
are given the tools to succeed, and when they know the
compensation and benefits to which they are entitled. Therefore,
any communications tool that helps facilitate this process can be
valuable. An employee handbook can serve as a reference document
for basic information about the employer, and for procedural
information about how certain issues are handled (e.g., medical
claims). It can also be a resource for a small bit of educational
information (e.g., certain legal obligations imposed by
securities laws regarding insider trading). It is always a
dynamic document, being changed from time to time to reflect
changes in the company. Educational experts tell us that
effective communication requires a variety of inputs--in other
words, a handbook by itself is not going to fulfill all employee
communication needs. However, the employee handbook can be
effective as part of an employee orientation process that
includes oral presentations and employee activity.<p>

Subject: Why have a handbook?<p>

Some companies have handbooks because they think the books are an
effective way of communicating information to employees. Some
companies think handbooks are not a good way of communicating
with employees (people don't read them, most of the stuff in them
is obvious or can be communicated orally or on the bulletin
board, etc.), and some companies are just so new and/or small
(under 75-100 people, I'd say) that there isn't much point in
taking the time to develop a handbook. A lot of HR [Human
Resources] people, of course, take for granted that there should
be a handbook. I think whether or not there should be a book
ought to depend on the HR thinking of the company, i.e. the
business culture -- is there information that needs to be
communicated, and is the handbook a good way to do it? The other
driver of handbooks is lawyers, who think of the handbook as a
good place to disclaim legal obligations to employees and at the
same time proclaim the company's "law" or rules that will be
applied to employees. It would not be necessary, in order to
disclaim obligations, to have a handbook -- one could write
employees yearly letters formally disclaiming the intent to
create contractual obligations, etc. It is convenient, though, to
do it in a handbook.<p> 

There is often tension between the business cultural objective of
a handbook and its legal goal. The business people want to make
sweeping statements of ideals or aspiration, to sell the company
to its employees, only to find themselves liable for making
promises they disclaim a legal duty to keep. It is very hard, I
find, to explain the lawyers' point of view to the business
people or to make the lawyers understand that the business people
have a real need to make their cultural statement. No wonder
handbooks produce so much litigation.<p>

Date: Tue Jan 16 21:09:03 1996<br>
Subject: Handbook Goals<p>

I recall the time when handbooks were mostly pitched as a device to make
unions "unnecessary." Poor communications were (and are) an important
factor in unionization, so anything that promoted better communications,
i.e., handbooks, helped promote a union free environment. Handbooks also
initially were promoted as bolstering employees' feelings of "security,"
until the court decisions of the 1970's and 1980's punished employers
who did too good a job of making employees feel "secure." Now, although
communications continues to be an important goal, fewer companies are
worried about unions, and more are worried about being hoisted on their
own handbooks. We have found that properly drafted handbooks can
actually help reduce the amount of litigation and can still promote good
communications. Those should be the primary goals of a company handbook
these days, in that order.<p>

Subject: 75-100 employee lower limit?<p> 

I'm surprised, Laura, that you think a company with fewer than 75
employees may forego the expense/effort required to create a good
handbook. With so many federal regulations triggered when a company
reaches 50 employees, I thought any company over that number ought to
have a handbook.<p>

<hr><p>

Appended by: Sharon Grodin -- Corbett & Kane - Emeryville<br>
Date: Wed Jan 17 18:28:02 1996<br> 
Subject: Small Employers <p>

I'm a big proponent of handbooks for small employers -- in which I'd
include employers with as few as five employees. Cloyd is right in
suggesting that to the extent size of the employer defines potential
liability under particular employment laws, size is one logical way to
identify which employers need employee handbooks. It's not the only
consideration, however. In some ways, small employers face even greater
challenges of communication and of providing supportive evidence in
litigation than do larger employers. Often the supervisor is an
entrepreneur wearing many hats, with little time or talent for
consistent employee communication or training, and often there is no
system of documentation for anything except revenue and expenses. A
handbook properly used can be an important supplement and guide for that
client. On the other hand, Laura Hoguet is right that not every small
employer will use a handbook properly or to best advantage; in such a
case it might be a waste of time (and even potentially harmful) to
develop a handbook.<p>

<hr><p>

Appended by: Sharon Grodin -- Corbett & Kane - Emeryville<br> 
Date: Wed Jan 17 18:40:54 1996<br>
Subject: Goal- Problem Solving<p>

In addition to the Handbook Goals others have noted, a good employee
handbook should identify, realistically and convincingly, avenues of
communication and problem solving for complicated situations. We can't
cover all the really hard supervision problems with admonitions in the
handbook (or they wouldn't be really hard problems), but we can make
sure employees and supervisors know how they are expected to communicate
constructively about such problems.<p>

<hr><p>

Appended by: Judith Keyes -- Corbett & Kane - Emeryville<br>
Date: Fri Jan 19 01:22:01 1996<br>
Subject: Why have a handbook?<p>

I may be stating the obvious here: but employers (especially small
employers) should not feel that a handbook is the <I>ONLY</i> way to
communicate with employees. In my experience, handbooks may not be
effective means of communication. They are forgotten over time, or
supplanted by intervening memos or by intervening events. There is
little more deadly than a handbook that has been forgotten -- and when
that has happened, I'd say the employer should eliminate the handbook,
substituting, say, a list of benefits (e.g., vacation accrual, holiday
entitlement) and leaving it at that.<p>

Appended by: Drucilla Stender Ramey -- Bar Assoc. of S.F. - San Francisco<br>
Date: Sun Jan 21 22:57:06 1996<br>
Subject: Why have a handbook?<p>

I feel that even very small outfits need to have some document that sets
forth the framework that governs hours, benefits, and the other matters
usually covered by an employee handbook. For one thing, the smaller the
company, the less likely there is to be an employee charged with truly
keeping track of and communicating these things.<p>

Subject: THE BASICS<p>

Here's a basic outline for the essentials:<p><OL>

<LI>A disclaimer to make sure that the handbook does not create a
contract or implied contract.<p> 

<LI>A statement of the employer's commitment to equal employment
opportunity, including sexual (and other) harassment policies and
complaint procedures.<p>

<LI>A description of the employer's rules, regulations and
procedures.<p>

<LI>A description of policies designed to help employees,
including FMLA[Family and Medical Leave Act].<p>

<LI>Guidelines for termination of employment.<p>

<LI>State and local legal requirements.</ol><p>

Subject: More basics<p>

While I generally agree with the set of basics just set forth, I
would add the following:<p><OL>

<LI>There should be a series of disclaimers which clarify what the
handbook does and does not do (discussed elsewhere in more detail).<p>

<LI>A list of employee benefits.<p>

<LI>An acknowledgement of receipt, possibly in different
forms for incumbent employees and new hires.<p>

<LI>Wherever possible, reservation of discretion or flexibility on the
part of management to deal with different employees differently.</ol><p>

What are some pitfalls that writers of employee handbooks can
fall into? How can they be avoided?<p>

Subject: Too Much Legalese<p>

As an employee communications vehicle, too much legalese in a
handbook can be a distraction to the message. If an attorney
drafts the handbook, have the human resources people critique the
document to evaluate whether the lawyers have gone too far. You
might even try out a draft on a cross-sample of rank and file
employees.<p>

Subject: What are the Pitfalls?<p>

A handbook that goes unread does not provide much value.
Therefore it should be only as long as necessary to get the job
done (i.e., as short as possible), and it must be written in
clear, normal English (or whatever language is appropriate to the
work force). As noted above, lawyers are not always the best
authors for this purpose. A professional writer should be
utilized for any document like this that will have wide
distribution.<p>

The other common pitfall of an employee handbook is the failure to
clearly specify that the document is intended as a reference source and
not as a contract of employment. There is lots of litigation over
"promises" made in employee handbooks that use careless language which
seem to create an employment contract rather than an 
<A HREF="http://www.courttv.com/legalhelp/business/workplace/660.html">
at will relationship</a>. The language must be chosen with care, and
state and federal law must be considered as the policies to be
communicated in the employee handbook are developed.<p>

Subject: Additional pitfalls and avoidance<p>

A constant problem with employee handbooks that I see is the
tendency to uncritically cut and paste a company's handbook
together from other employer models. Frequently the borrowed
material is out of date or while sensible for its original user
makes no sense in the current employer's context. Another thing I
usually recommend is to have a sunset provision that causes a
policy to expire at a specified date in the future unless it is
specifically reaffirmed. This way one can avoid getting caught by
policies that everyone has forgotten even exist.<p>

Subject: Chilling Morale<P>

I think another difficult call is in tech areas involving use of email,
computers, voicemail, etc.<p>

How can employers protect themselves from exposure for liability, yet
avoid policies so onerous that employees' creativity and/or morale is
stifled, or alternatively, the policies are uniformly ignored?<p>

Subject: Pitfalls<p>

<OL>
<LI>Overpromising: setting standards which supervisors cannot always meet
or saddling the company with working conditions which changed
circumstances no longer permit.<p>

<LI>Inconsistency between sections, which
is often a function of...<p>

<LI>Poor organization, often the result of the slapping together of
different models referred to above, but with the extra pitfall of no one
knowing exactly what the handbook contains until a plaintiffs lawyer
points out multiple or confusing promises which have been made.<p>

<LI>Inadequate disclaimers: I should note that I disagree
somewhat with those who seek less legalese in handbooks. My first goal
for a handbook is that it help to reduce litigation; the second goal is
good communication, in that order (see my post on a separate thread).
This is matter of degree -- the good handbook really should accomplish
both objectives and should certainly be readable -- but if it becomes
exhibit A in a lawsuit against the company nobody is very happy with the
HR person who made sure the employees were able to understand and read
the handbook.</ol><p>

Subject: What are the Pitfalls<p>

"Less Is More" would be a good rule for handbooks -- too much detail
makes problems. Rather than have an enormously complex rule book, it
makes sense to keep the book as short and plain English as possible--
and have a detailed book, if necessary, for internal use of HR [Human
Resources] administrators. This one ought to say on every page, in a
footer, that it is not distributed to employees and is not to be relied
on as a policy statement. I noticed Maurice's comment that the
handbook's first objective ought to be legal protection of employer.
Does everyone agree with this? Is the legalization of HR a fait
accompli? How do HR people feel about this?<p>

Subject: Legalese and Computers<p>

To avoid litigation, I agree with Maurice that legalese is
necessary -- but limited to those portions that are designed to protect
the employer, such as the disclaimer and the employee receipt. In the
sections dealing with vacations, etc., legalese can be a turnoff to
employees and should be avoided or at least toned-down.<p>

In response to Monica's concern about the chilling effect of a computer
use policy, I do not have a problem with allowing employees to use their
computers for term papers or for the preparation of announcements for
charitable events -- provided that prior supervisory approval is given.
(The

Subject: Exempt-non-exempt<br>

Employers creating one handbook to cover both exempt and non-exempt
employees must be careful to distinguish policies that do not apply to
both employee categories. For example, policies concerning "tardiness"
or "time cards" do not apply to exempt employees. [For a discussion of
the difference between exempt and non-exempt employees, See this <A
HREF="http://www.courttv.com/legalhelp/survival/work/123.html"> Legal
Help File</a> from the Court TV Survival Guide.] One way of handling this
issue is to include a general statement at the beginning of the handbook
that "except where otherwise provided, the handbook applies to both
exempt and non-exempt employees." Where a policy applies only to one
category of employee, the policy can so indicate, e.g. "For non-exempt
employees only."<p>

Subject: Wishful Thinking<p>

Wishful thinking on the part of the handbook drafter is a tremendous
potential pitfall. As with any employer-employee communication, if the
handbook does not reflect accurately the workplace it purports to
describe and guide, the handbook will be useless or worse. The most
productive and challenging question I can ask in the course of a
handbook review is, "How does this really work?"<p>

Subject: Chilling Morale<p>

Regarding electronic media, there's too much focus right now on the
medium, and too little on the message. Hurting employee morale by
providing guidance on the use of these media is a short-term concern. In
another few years, we will be used to business conventions about the use
of e-mail, voice mail, the Internet, etc. The business conventions will
flow from the same sense that most of us have now in using the telephone
or writing a letter in the workplace:<p><OL>

<LI>If it's personal, it should rarely be done in the workplace;<p>

<LI>Anything done in the workplace presents a greater risk that it will
not be treated as private by the employer;<p>

<LI>If personal use costs money (as with long-distance calls, use of
copiers, etc.), you should pay for it;<p>

<LI>If it's potentially offensive to others in the workplace, keep it
out of the workplace;<p>

<LI>If your use of the employer's communications media is potentially
embarassing or harmful to the employer, don't be surprised if your
employer wants to find out about it and wants you to stop.</ol><p>

Your five principles outlined above appear to me (not an employment law

be incorporated in a handbook. Have you used them before? <p>

Subject: Plain Language <p>

I can count on one hand the number of clients I've met who would be
comfortable with a handbook which states principles as baldly as I have
done in my earlier post, because most employers (especially HR people)
are so used to handbook-speak that they feel the need to see something
that looks more "corporate" and familiar. My favorite chalIenge is to
make it plain, and still fit the client's particular style. I do use
materials for supervisory training which read just like my earlier post,
because I get to do training in _my_ style.<p>

Subject: Exempt-non-exempt<p>

Slightly different topic: A remarkable number of workplaces still use
the terms "salaried" and "hourly" in a way which indicates, in that
culture, that there are status differences between classifications of
nonexempt employees. These verbal habits persist even though the
employer is aware that the terms have no legal significance in a
wage/hour analysis, and even though the terms are potentially confusing.
I say: let them maintain their culture, but make sure there is very
explicit language in the handbook which distinguishes "salaried" and
"hourly" from "exempt" and "nonexempt." (Also, the use of these terms is
a good clue that hours-worked documentation for nonexempt employees may
need tightening up in that workplace.)<p>

Subject: pitfalls<p>

If the handbook is in a loose leave format, it is easier to make
modifications and distribute them. One problem I have encountered is
that while we have a receipt that the employee received the handbook in
199x we do not have proof that he received the changes made to various
policies. The receipts for the changes may become as important as the
initial receipt. This problem can be resolved with a tear-off receipt
system with the immediate supervisors being responsible to collect the
receipts and turn them over to hr only once all employees in the
department have signed. It is a pain but if the objective is to minimize
risk it is a worthwhile task.<p>

(not resigning)  ;-)<p>

Is there any value in having employees sign their employee manual on an
annual basis? Or having a form that the employee signs as part of an
annual review process, acknowledging that s/he has read revisions during
the year? Or is that getting too bureaucratic??<p>

Subject: disciplinary language<p>

Virtually all employment today is At Will, of course. However, many
handbooks contain language threatening "disciplinary action" <I>including
termination</i> for violation of various rules and regulations, etc..
There are many cases in which the conflict between the latter provisions
and at will language is raised in support of a wrongful discharge claim.
While the courts seem to be considering the at will language to avoid
any implication of just cause employment arising from the quoted
language, I wonder what purpose is served by including such language and
whether it is better to just state the prohibited conduct and to leave
it at that..<p>

Subject:  annual re-signing?<p>

Are the administrative and bureaucratic headaches and concerns of having
employees re-sign annually eliminated by having the handbook on-line
accessible to all employees? It would then be a "living" document with
revisions and additions apparent (or called out from time to time). Does
this raise a different set of concerns?<p>

<hr><p>

Appended by: Sharon Grodin -- Corbett & Kane - Emeryville<br>
Date: Sat Jan 20 11:27:46 1996<br>
Subject: annual re-signing?<p>

There's value in documenting that an employee has been reminded of the
rules. I suspect there's less value in a routine re-signing for the
purpose of establishing consent. Two problems often occur: 1) the
employee testifies convincingly that the re-signing is routine and
meaningless, or not voluntary, and 2) an employee who has been annoyed
by some feature of the handbook may make an annual event of refusing to
sign.<p>

Subject: What are the Pitfalls?<p>

Monica makes a good point. I think we're about to enter the 2nd
generation of these policies, going from the "don't expect privacy in
e-mail" phase to the "here's what it's for" (or NOT for) phase. That's
much harder to articulate. The old fashioned telephone model (not to be
used for personal business except in emergencies) just doesn't wash for
e-mail, especially in the creative environment, as Monica says. Another
point re: pitfalls (related to the "don't make promises you can't [or
won't] keep" admonition is this. Employers tend to see handbooks as
something akin to recruiting devices -- as thought if the handbook is
inviting (warm, fuzzy) enough, it will somehow mollify employees, or
make them happier, or something. This is potentially problematic when
the employer is attempting to read the policies narrowly, or to use them
as defining.<p>

Subject: Annual resigning<p>

Sharon raises an important question -- what do you do with the employee
who refuses to resign for a given year? If the employer does not fire
her, that can be used to argue that she was no longer an employee at
will. If she is fired, the argument is that she was entitled to some
sort of protection which was violated by the termination. However, it
seems clear that the refusal cannot simply be ignored.<p>

<H2>Fun and a Theme [Are Generally Missing]</h2>

<H2>The Ultimate Employee Handbook -- A Workshop</h2>

<H3>Workshop Discussion Thread</h3>

From: Michael P. Maslanka -- Clark, West - Dallas<br>
Date: Mon Jan 15 19:01:01 1996<br>
Subject: fun and a theme<p>

Last Append: Sun Jan 21 22:51:11 1996<p>

[Fun and a theme] are the two things missing from most handbooks.
Think about your high school yearbook. The very thought of
opening it up and looking at a picture of myself from 20 years
ago leaves me cold. I think most employees would rather look at
the old yearbook than pick up an employee handbook.<p> 

Here are a couple of thoughts: First, some progressive companies
borrow a concept from the restaurant industry which says that
people eat with their eyes before they eat with their mouths.
Same with handbooks. If it looks foreboding than the employee is
not going to pick it up and use it as a reference guide. For
instance, the Wild Oats Community market has a handbook, printed
on paper. The color of the handbook is warm and inviting. It
makes you want to pick it up. Also, the print size on the inside
is "user friendly." The sections are set off in large bold type
and the formatting is varied, which makes it easier to read.<p>

Second, most handbooks lack a sense of fun. To return to
Wildoats: One of their benefits is the payment of $200.00 to a
new father or mother. Instead of just putting it in the handbook,
the handbook says: "It is important that Wild Oat staff members
reproduce themselves so that we will have new managers for the
next century!" I know this is not for everyone, but the point
is well taken: However written, the handbook should make the
employee want to read on.<p>

Third, handbooks which lack a theme miss an opportunity to
inculcate the employee with the company's view of the
employer/employee relationship. The sense of entitlement which
many employees have can, I think, be watered down with the right
handbook language. By way of example, I've seen a handbook, which
in the table of contents organizes topics under two general
headings: "What You Can Expect From (the company)" and then "What
(the company) Expects From You." To return to Wild Oats, their
handbook is broken down to "Responsibility to Our Customers";
"Responsibility to Our Staff"; "Responsibility to Our Community";
and "Responsibility to the Bottom Line." It's this sense of a
shared commitment and of mutual responsibility that is lacking
in many handbooks. The bottom line: A handbook should be
<I>more</i> than a compilation of policies.<p>

Subject: Creative Use of the Intranet<p>

The first electronic brief in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language -
the hotlinks used on the Internet's World Wide Web) has been
filed in the U.S. Supreme Court, eliciting an enthusiastic
response from Justice O'Connor.<p>

Can the first electronic employee manual (published in HTML on
the Company's private "Intranet"), be far off? The advantage of
HTML is that you can insert a hotlink every time there is a
reference to another part of the document (such as a defined term
of art or a footnote) or to another document (such as a list of
persons who can answer questions), or to perform functions (such
as a database query or the popup of an e-mail menu).<p>

I know of a company in Silicon Valley that has it's own internal home
page -- with icons employees can "click" for information about leave
entitlement, vacation scheduling etc. The home page can be updated
daily; is interactive (so questions can be fielded), etc. It seems to
work well, and, to me, to be a great idea. Why not?<p>

Subject: electronic manauals<p>

I think that electronic handbooks are great, and agree that links to
other parts would be terrific. In fact, the possibilites are especially
exciting in light of the advent of, e.g., video. For example, in the
diversity area, our bar ass'n. has produced all kinds of model policies,
videotapes, Goals and Timetables, including detailed examples of how
inexpensive accommodation of even very severe disabilities can be, etc.,
and these can help in employee sensitivity training simply by their
being easily accessible through the employee manual. There are obvious
problems in making sure that all old material is truly "deleted" (which
is said to be less than a sure thing), that the manaual is accessible
only to the firm's employees, and that new additions have been run by
counsel, etc., but on balance, I think it would be a great advance.<p>

<H2>Disclaimers</h2>

<H2>The Ultimate Employee Handbook -- A Workshop</h2>

<H3>Workshop Discussion Thread</h3>

Subject: Disclaimers<p>

Latest Append: Thu Jan 25 11:12:58 1996<p>

Everyone knows the handbook should disclaim that it is a contract, but
there are really a series of disclaimers or "clarifiers" which every
employee handbook should contain, preferably on the first page. (Indeed,
courts in New Jersey and Maryland have insisted that the disclaimers be
given considerable prominence in order to have any effect). As too many
employers give short shrift to the need for <I>multiple</i> disclaimers,
here is a starter list of those which the handbook should absolutely
have:<p><OL>

<LI>Not a contract, express or implied. (Must be bold-faced in
Maryland.)<p>

<LI>Does not alter the <A
HREF="http://www.courttv.com/legalhelp/business/workplace/660.html"> "at
will"</a> relationship or guarantee employment for any definite period
of time.<p>

<LI>Who the handbook does and does not apply to.<p>

<LI>Supercedes any previous handbook or unwritten policies.<p>

<LI>Cannot be modified except in writing, by the President.<p>

<LI>May be changed or revoked unilaterally by the Company at any
time.<p>

<LI>Is not all-inclusive, but offers general guidelines only.</ol><p>

There are others, which apply to specific provisions, but these should
all be up front, or else the company faces unnecessary legal
exposure.<p>

I like to see most of Maurice's disclaimer elements replicated in the
signed employee receipt.<p>

In addition, I think the disclaimer itself should state that the terms
of written insurance policies control over the brief summary of employee
benefits described in the handbook.<p>

Subject: employment application <p>

A disclaimer should also appear in the employment application. It's just
amazing how often a plaintiff will claim that,yes, he signed the
disclaimer in the handbook but before that he was promised such and such
while going through the application process. Also, companies, when
hiring executives, often neglect to have them fill out an application or
receipt of a handbook. Of course,<I>all</i> applicants who do not have
an employment contract must be required to complete an application
(sorry, a resume alone just won't do) and sign off on the handbook.
Although we as lawyers consider these matters self-evident, many
companies -- especially those in one which is going through rapid growth
-- do not cross their t's and dot their i's in this regard.<p>

Subject: Disclaimers<p>

When it comes to employee handbooks, an employer simply cannot have its
cake and eat it, too. Specificity in policy and procedure may be
interpreted as a contract by a court, and so the need for disclaimers.
But this must be balanced against the desirability of good employee
relations, especially in a non-union location which is hoping to remain
so. While a friendly disclaimer may be riskier in court, there is a lot
to be said for not antaganozing your workforce. Consider a statement
which reminds employees that the realtionship with the employer is by
its nature mutual - just as an employee is free to quit, the employer
may also end the employment relationship at any time.<p>

Subject: what about partners?<p> 

I am curious -- to what degree are partners subject to any kind of
employee manual? Are they bound only by the partnership agreement, many
of which contain woefully little in the area of discrimination? In
general, what, exactly, do most partnership agreements contain and how
should they be changed to catch up with the Real World?<p>

Subject: Disclaimers<p>

As noted in another thread, the California Supreme Court recently
decided the <I>Scott v. PG&E</i> case, holding that despite at-will
language, a contract not to discipline without good cause could be
implied-in-fact based upon a company's "positive discipline" policy. How
would the <I>Scott</i> case change the handbook disclaimer - is it
enough to simply disclaim any contractual nature of the handbook or
company policies/practices? Should the employer specifically reserve the
right to discipline at-will? If so, should the employer also retain the
right to do other changes to the workplace (e.g. benefits,
reorganization, etc)? If all this is included, the disclaimer starts
getting pretty long. What about simply putting a "management rights"
clause in the disclaimer, reserving sole discretion in the employer on
issues of wages, hours and working conditions?<p>

Any thoughts?<p>

<hr><p>

From: Hope Pomerantz -- Williams Caliri - Wayne<br>
Date: Thu Jan 25 11:12:58 1996<br>
Subject: Jerry Morales' Disclaimer<p>

This is a good disclaimer. However, we have found, at least in New
Jersey, that despite the at-will language in the disclaimer, there
should still be another separate "AT-WILL" disclaimer inserted in the
front of the manual, standing alone,. In our courts, this seems to be
the only way of further ensuring success at the summary judgment level
if a case is brought, and lends itself to summary disposition.<p>

<H2>Employee Receipt</h2>

<H2>The Ultimate Employee Handbook -- A Workshop</h2>

<H3>Workshop Discussion Thread</h3>

From: Michael P. Maslanka -- Clark, West - Dallas<br>
Date: Tue Jan 16 17:21:49 1996<br>
Subject: employee receipt<p>

Lastest Append: Wed Jan 24 08:47:19 1996<p>

One area of importance is how the handbook is implemented in the
workforce. it can be a terrific piece of work, but if it is not
implemented properly it will land with a thud. A couple of ideas:<p><OL>

<LI>Have the employee in the acknowlegment state that not only has he
read the acknowledgment stating that he got it and that he is an
employee 
<A HREF="http://www.courttv.com/legalhelp/business/workplace/660.html">at
will</a>, but also put in there that he will read the policies within
one week of their receipt and ask his or her supervisor about any points
that he or she does not understand.<p>

<LI>One of our clients has a new hire orientation check list. The
checklist covers a three month span(which is the length of the
orientation period). On a monthly basis a supervisor reviews portions of
the manual with the employee together with other employment issues.
There is then a checklist to show the supervisor went over the issues
with the employee. the supervisor has to <I>print</i> his or her name(this
makes it easier later on to find out who covered it with the employee).
The idea is that a person can swallow just so much information at any
one sitting.<p>

<LI>Disney world has an interesting concept. They figure a new employee
could care less about a bunch of policies the first day on the job. So
what they do <I>first</i> thing is show the employee where he punches
in; where his work station will be; where to park his car; and how he
gets his paycheck etc. The idea is that when you do this first the
employee can concentrate on the employee handbook stuff. Otherwise the
employee is thinking about this mundane <STRONG>BUT TO THE EMPLOYEE THE
MOST IMPORTANT STUFF</strong> while an hr [human resources] guy is
droning on about policies.</ol><p>

Subject: Acknowledgements<p>

Depending upon the employer's situation, we have offered different
receipt forms for new hires and existing employees. The latter form may
say simply that the employee has received the handbook and understands
that it is his reponsibility to read it, while the new employees get the
form containing all the "at will" stuff. Some first-time companies have
run into trouble with their existing employees when they confront them
with the detailed acknowledgement form, whereas new hires will sign
anything. The cases are mixed on how much value the acknowledgement form
alone has anyway.<p>

Subject: employee receipt<p>

Another pleasant and effective method used by one of our clients: once a
year, employees in a department get together for cookies and handbook
reading for about an hour. They split the handbook into manageable
portions, read to themselves, and employees (and supervisors) comment
and ask questions of the group, as questions occur to them. This method
has improved the value of the handbook tremendously, both legally and
practically, and has inspired some interesting discussions which
prompted changes to the handbook.<p>

Subject: Counsel Presence Required?<p>

The group session on the handbook sounds interesting, Sharon. But it
also might be dangerous if the employer started to "explain" what a
particular section of the handbook "means." I'd be leery of suggesting
this procedure to a client without insisting that counsel be present. Am
I being overly cautious?<p>

Subject: Counsel Presence Required?<p>

If an attorney's presence is required in order to guard against oral
interpretations of the handbook by a supervisor, then the handbook has
not been well written and the supervisor has not been adequately
trained. I think a handbook is near to useless if it does not enable the
supervisor to use it as a guide, and if it does not empower a supervisor
to supervise and communicate directly with employees. In the
group-discussion situation I've described, notes are taken about
questions asked and answered, and some of those questions and answers
are reviewed later with an attorney to evaluate whether the handbook
should be clarified. I also recommend an attorney-run training session
with supervisors, which combines an orientation to the handbook with a
refresher on legal issues.<p>

We have a raging debate among the lawyers and the HR staff and
management. Can the handbook be put on line? Printing is very expensive,
updates are hard to do, etc. However, how do you ensure everyone sees
it, reads and understands it and, most importantly, agrees to the
policies (including At-Will)?<p>

I suppose you can send stuff by e-mail that is registered (at least you
can here on Counsel Connect). But the problem is that at a summary
judgment hearing or at a trial you need to hit a judge or jury over the
head, and nothing quite works like a big blow up with the plaintiff's
signature.<p>

Date: Fri Jan 19 16:03:21 1996<br>
Subject: Group Handbook meetings<p>

I'm intrigued by the notion of monthly meetings to discuss the handbook.
How is the "employment at will" language explained? Does management
really tell people that they can get canned any time we feel like it,
whether we have a valid reason to do so or not? If not, I see a real
danger of testimony that the boss told us at the meeting that this
language meant that we would not be fired unless management had a good
reason for doing so. A handbookis either a device for raising morale or
a legal protection arrangement. If it is the latter, the meeting will
seriously diminish its utility.<p>

Subject: monthly meeting thumbs down<p>

I too see a problem with the staff meeting where the handbook is
discussed. If the handbook is so well written, why do we need a meeting?
And, when a hypothetical question comes up, any answer the supervisor
gives becomes a footnote to the book, without benefit of counsel. As an
attorney paid to be a nervous nelly, I don't like it...<p>

Subject: a variation<p>

One idea of an employee meeting on a handbook is what one of my clients
does which is to have a 10 or 15 minute meeting every other week to
cover certain items(i.e. safety,new production goals etc.). When
something of an operational nature isn't on the agenda, they will cover
an item in the handbook -- such as policynagainst harassment, EEO
committment etc. When the lawsuit is filed, this all comes in as
background evidence that they just don't write something up, and forget
about it.<p>

<hr><p>

Appended by: Neil Bernstein -- WA Univ. School/Law - St. Louis<br>
Date: Sun Jan 21 18:13:31 1996<br>
Subject: What about discipline? <p>

The discussions are helpful in regard to the harassment policy and EEO,
I guess, but they should never, never, never include a discussion of
disclipline policy. And if the supervisors are told they are not to
discuss discipline, the meetings can be counterproductive. No meetings,
I vote.<p>

Subject:  Online Handbook<p>

Regarding Scott's earlier question about having the handbook online, I
think more and more companies will do that as they go paperless. Online
versions also have the advantage of being easier to amend and
disseminate to employees. And, if the handbook is not meant to be an
employment agreement but simply a document that affirms the statutory
presumption of at-will employment, the need for a signature per se
indicating agreement may not be as great, as long as the handbook's
existence and accessibility to employees online is publicized widely and
regularly.<p>

Subject: Track Usage?<p>

Do you think that the usage of this online handbook should be tracked?
Should an employee's views of various handbook internal web pages be
catalogued? Should the employee sign-in to the handbook when viewing
it?<p>

<hr><p>

Appended by: Scott Wollaston -- Rolm Systems - Santa Clara<br>
Date: Mon Jan 22 14:31:40 1996<br>
Subject: employee receipt<p>

One of the key problems with an on-line only (put aside for the moment
what you do for new employees) is access to the manual. If all
employees, including the night janitor, have a terminal on their desk
(assuming they have a desk) you might be able to show receipt. We are
thinking of having kiosks spread around so all employees can access the
manual.<p> 

One other problem is going to be keeping up with updates. While it is
never good to have a printed manual that is out of date because of
changes that never effectively get distributed to all employees, I can
see keeping track of revisions will be a nightmare. Companies these days
are not managing the "details" very well. Unless a librarian of some
sort keeps track of revisions, it would well be very difficult to
establish in a lawsuit what a particular policy was if it had been
changed at any time during the life of the manual.<p>

It is true that a systems administrator needs to keep track of changes
in the online handbook. Over the years as major and minor edits are made
it could be difficult if not impossible to take a snapshot view of the
policies at a particular point in time. A revision history at the front
of the online handbook might be worthwhile.<p> 

As far as electronic records that an employee reviewed the policies
while employed, I suppose that is technologically possible, and perhaps
worth pursuing if it becomes an issue in litigation. A lot depends on
the culture of the company. In any event it seems to me the more
important thing is that it is made available to employees and they are
so told.<p>

Subject: Online Handbook Technology<p>

I agree with Ted that online handbooks are likely to become popular.
I'll go farther and predict that they will become a "killer app" as
firms and companies migrate more and more of their internal
communication to the company Intranet (that's InTRAnet, not InTERnet).
The techniques of HTML "hotlinks" to display other material at the click
of a pointer, when combined with the user-friendly possibilities of
animation and communication and query techniques of Java applets
embedded in the document, strike me as offering human resources an
exciting chance to combine both an individual help desk and the group
"cookie session" mentioned earlier, with a perfect audit trail of what
questions were asked and what answers were given.<p> 

The technological infrastructure for legal support of the online
handbook is important. Judging from the products presented at the RSA
Data Security Conference last week, I'd say that the technology is all
there, with rollout of implementation ready to follow the demand
promptly. The key ingredients I see are:<p><OL>

<LI>robust digital signatures of employees, using public key crypto
techniques which provide non-repudiation as to <STRONG>WHO</strong>
received the document, and <STRONG>WHAT</strong> version of the document
was received;<p>

<LI>trusted third-party time-stamping services which identify in a
non-repudiatable fashion <STRONG>WHAT VERSION</strong> of the
referencing document (i.e., the top page) was received, and
<STRONG>WHEN</strong> it was received, and <STRONG>WHAT VERSION</strong>
of the referenced documents were located at the other end of the
hotlinks at the same time the top page was received.</ol><p> 

To provide strong non-repudiation of the employee's digital signature,
the discussion of commercial key escrow in the 

<A HREF="http://www.courttv.com/seminars/handbook/merrill1.html">

"Employee E-MailEncryption"</a> thread should be considered. If
commercial key escrow is implemented on the company's system, it is
extremely important that only the <I>session keys</i> for each
individual message are escrowed, and not the employee's permanent
<I>private key</i> in the public key cryptosystem. If the employee can
argue that the employer's escrow system could possibly have allowed the
employer to spoof his digital signature, the elegant legal
non-repudiability of the employee's digital signature disappears. There
is no comparable problem with the leading time-date stamp technology
(Surety Technologies), which does not require cryptographic keys at
all.<p>

For those interested, some of these concepts are treated in the October
95 draft of the ABA Information Security Committee (Section of Science
and Technology) Digital Signature Guidelines, and continue to be
explored in detail in the Counsel Connect "E-Mail and Electronic
Commerce Forum", which you'll find under DISCUSS, then under National
and International, then under Computers and Technology.<p>

Subject: Why We Need This Seminar<p>

Throughout the 1980s and continuing into the 1990's, the legal landscape
governing employment handbooks dramatically changed. Prior to this
period, courts considered the vast majority of employees to be employees
<A HREF="http://www.courttv.com/legalhelp/business/workplace/660.html">
at-will</a> -- meaning they could be terminated for any reason and at any
time, as long as a law was not contravened. In addition, prior to this
time, employers were free to change any benefit plans that had been
offered to its employees without potential liability. As the rule of
employment at-will eroded in the courts and as courts were asked to
interpreted benefit provisions in the handbook and in other documents,
personnel manuals -- which had been viewed as simply corporate
communication documents -- suddenly were transformed into legally
binding, "contracts of employment." Many employers were startled to find
that statements that they made in their handbooks were now being
enforced by courts as express or implied "promises." Some employers
unfortunately learned that breaching such manual provisions resulted in
substantial jury verdicts and damage awards being assessed against the
corporation.<p>

While the law concerning personnel handbooks is still evolving -- often
on a state-by-state basis -- one clear message has emerged: every word
counts in drafting or revising personnel manuals. While manuals still
serve an integral role in the workplace, gone are the days when an
employer could communicate with impunity via its handbook. Today, it is
extremely important for employers to be aware that in preparing a manual
they are drafting a quasi-legal document that must be thoughtfully and
carefully assembled.<p>

Does anyone [else] think that an antitrust compliance policy
should be part of the typical employee handbook? Or is this
something that just belongs in the management realms?<p>

Subject: Antitrust Compliance Policy<p> 

There is one area where antitrust compliance belongs in an employee
handbook, and that is price fixing in companies where employees have the
opportunity to have communications with competitors that could create
this problem. It doesn't have to be a big deal: "Agreements between
producers of competing products to fix prices are illegal. Employees may
not discuss the pricing of our products with competitors. If you are
present at any discussion with competitors at which prices are
discussed, contact the General Counsel immediately to discuss the
matter." This could help the company someday show that it had done what
it could to make its employees aware of the law so if they broke it [it]
wasn't the company's idea. The same principle applies to securities law
compliance and insider trading.<p>

I think I would go a bit further than just talking about price fixing. I
would caution my employees about their activities with trade
associations. I might cover the concept of the illegal group boycott,
for example. But again, this is probably not for all employees, and
might be covered in a separate Corporate Antitrust Policy distributed to
managers.<p>

Subject: Antitrust Compliance Policy<p>

There are two separate questions:<p>

What kind of antitrust message should be in the employee message? What
kind of antitrust compliance policy should be in effect?<p>

The employee handbook should probably have a condensed antitrust
compliance message, with emphasis on the criminal violations. It should
reference the more detailed antitrust policy (which should be given to
all employees).<p> 

There should be an antitrust policy that provides for compliance with
all applicable antitrust and similar laws. This would cover the obvious
criminal violations, and then should cover the civil violations with an
emphasis on the types of situations that relate to the company's
business. For a company selling consumer products, a Robinson-Patman
compliance policy is very important. For a company providing consulting
services, it is less important.<p> 

In addition, there may be certain antitrust laws (e.g., things relating
to acquisitions) that should be focused on appropriate segments of
management.<p> 

Antitrust is just one of the key legal considerations that should be
covered in an employee handbook. All of the relevant federal criminal
statutes should be covered in the handbook, along with reference to more
detailed policy statements, and procedures for contacting the Law
Department. The subject should be reviewed and reinforced during the
employee orientation program. A videotaped message from a senior exec
emphasizing the company's commitment to legal compliance would also be a
good idea.<p>

Employees should get legal compliance policies covering the following

<LI>Political Contributions
<LI>Lobbying
<LI>Copyright, work for hire 
<LI>Conflicts of Interest 
<LI>Computer Software
<LI>Reporting of Wrongdoing 
<LI>Industry specific laws (e.g., commitment to pure food, honest
advertisements)</ul><p>

All of this can be put in the employee handbook or in some other
publication(s) that goes to the employee. It needs to be reinforced with
some sort of training.<p>

<H2>Sick Leave -- Substance Abuse</h2>

<H2>The Ultimate Employee Handbook -- A Workshop</h2>

<H3>Workshop Discussion Thread</h3>

From: Kirk Brown -- Law Office - Pueblo<br>
Date: Thu Jan 18 16:19:57 1996<br>
Subject: Sick leave-substance abuse<p>

Last Append: Sat Jan 20 11:57:02 1996<p>

Any suggestions for policies regarding "sick leave" policies? Obviously
personnel managers want to discourage (or exclude) "sick leave" for
alcohol or other substance abuse (meaning the employee "calls in sick "
because he or she is "under the influence").<p> 

Given that an employee is entitled to leave for treatment,
hospitalization, or meeting attendance under the ADA [Americans with
Disabilities Act], FMLA [Family and Medical Leave Act], and the
Rehabilitation Act, there must be some way to word a policy that does
not take adverse action against a person with a record of a disability
or a perceived disability and yet gives the employer some leverage in
dealing with an employee who calls in (generally with little notice)
hungover or under the influence.<p>

Perhaps a generic "excused absense" vs. "unexcused absence" policy with
notice requirements stated for each?<p>

Appended by: Melissa McMorries -- Atty-M McMorries - Atlanta<br>
Date: Thu Jan 18 21:41:07 1996<br>
Subject: Sick leave-substance abuse<p>

My understanding of the ADA on alcohol and substance abuse is that the
condition is recognized as a disability <I>provided that the employee is
not actively pursuing his or her addiction</i>. In other words, if the
employee is pursuing a treatment or other recovery program, ADA
protections applies; if the employee is actively using alcohol or drugs,
ADA protections do not apply. A sick call for a hangover or for being
under the influence would necessarily indicate that the employee was not
following the prescribed treatment or recovery program. It follows then
that normal disciplinary policies would apply for an unexcused absence.
While relapse is common, particularly early on in a treatment program,
most, if not all, treatment counselors would encourage an employer to
take disciplinary action for relapse behavior. Otherwise, the employer
is engaging in "enabling" behavior, which can impede an employee's
recovery.<p>

One method is to attack the behaviors around the attendance problem
rather than the lack of attendnace itself. For example, one might
punish heavily for failure to call-in to report absence or tardiness, a
misbehavior that is frequent associated with attendance abusers.<p>

NAME=William Adams<br>
COMPANY=Feldman, Waldman & Kline<br>

QUESTION=One good way to control abuse of a company's sick-leave policy
is to merge vacation and sick leave into one interchangeable policy. For
example, if a company offers 10 days of vacation and 10 days of sick
leave, a flexible time off policy of equivalent value would permit 15
days off for any reason. Thus, it no longer matters whether the employee
is sick or on vacation. Further, employees who use excessive sick leave
will have less available vacation. After companies adopt such a program,
sick days are cut dramatically. For those who wonder why 15 days of
flexible time off can be considered equivalent to 10 sick days plus 10
vacation days, there is an explanation that must be supplied to the
employees. Most employees use only 2-3 legitimate sick days per year.
For them, there will be an increase in vacation time. An employer should
let those who abuse the present sick leave policy do their own math as
to whether they are better off or not, but the most they can lose is
five days of sick leave, even if they take the maximum every year. I
hope this is helpful.<p>

Subject: Sick leave-substance abuse<p> 

I agree with Robert Zielinski that it may be more effective to look at
how behaviors are affecting work, rather than merely looking at them as
a problem of sick leave abuse. I'd take it a step further, though. For
example, instead of using sick leave or calling in late, the same
hungover employee might show up at work and be useless. Unless there is
some special protection for the employee's condition, what's really
irking the employer at this point is that the employee has not
aknowledged a responsibility to avoid diminishing his or her ability to
do good work. This is a performance issue, and can be addressed without
a focus on specific infractions like tardiness or call-in rules.<p>

<H2>Computer Network Policies</h2>

<H2>The Ultimate Employee Handbook -- A Workshop</h2>

<H3>Workshop Discussion Thread</h3>

Date: Thu Jan 18 08:54:33 1996<br>
Subject: Computer Network Policies<p>

Last Append: Fri Jan 19 12:05:48 1996<p>

Given that we're holding this workshop in cyberspace, and the
danger of chilling employee morale through computer and
telecommunications equipment use policies has been raised, I
think it's time to start a separate thread on this issue.<p>

Sharon Grodin has suggested that the old paradigms covering the
nature of the workplace can be adapted to cover new
technologies.<p>

On the other hand, there seems little doubt that people who are
unfamiliar with how the technology actually works may be at sea
when it comes to issues such as privacy/permanency of e-mail
systems.<p>

Obtaining information from online services and then distributing
that information on an internal company communications system may
easily lead to unintended copyright violations.<p>

Chas. Merrill will likely explain his views on whether an
employer should forbid the use of strong encryption on a company
LAN. Or is this really a business policy issue, as opposed to a
legal question?<p>

So, I think we need a separate thread to address how handbooks
should be updated to reflect the impact of new technologies.<p>

Subject: Computer Network Policies<p>

I'd love an explanation why the risk of copyright infringement is
greater if the medium is network distribution of material found
on the Internet, rather than, for example, photocopying the same
material from a book and routing or mailing it. The only factors
I can think of are 1) the electronic medium is faster so you
don't have as much time to worry about it before you do it, and
2) people aren't educated to understand that the electronic
distribution method amounts to the same thing as the more manual
method. It seems to me that a very little training--and yes,
maybe some handbook language--would solve this problem without
making it a thorny legal issue. (I'll be waiting in my horsedrawn
carriage for responses to this.)<p>

Subject: A few more factors<p>

I'd say you've hit the big ones -- lack of education and speed.
To those I'd add: 1) When one copies electronic documents, they
can more easily lose there identifying characteristics than when
one photcopies a page; and 2) When one copies documents at a
photocopy machine, one knows exactly how many copies one is
making, and is aware of the reams of paper flowing through the
machine, whereas when I unleash a copy in a networked
environment, how many copies have I made?<p>

By the way, it's interesting that you use the photocopy machine
as an example of <I>old</i> technology (from the horse and buggy
era)!<g><p>

Perhaps more important than the copyright aspect of computer network use
in the workplace, is communicating with employees about the use of the
company's email network, and what they should expect with regard to the
privacy of their email. Most experts I have spoken with about this
advise that their client employers specifically state that email on the
company systems is subject to monitoring without warning.<p>

Does anyone include a policy re: alcohol use during lunch...while
it may be a good policy from a preventative measure, it seems to
smack of big brother and may be unreasonable in an environment
where deals may be discussed with overseas visitors who think it
perfectly natural to have a glass of wine or speck of beer over
mid day discussions. Perhaps a policy that one should not drive
if their judgment is in any way impaired by the use of alcohol
and should not be drinking to a point where it will effect their
ability to do their job.<p>

<H2>Written Employment Contracts</h2>

Subject: Written employment contracts<p>

Last Append: Mon Jan 29 14:09:46 1996<p>

The legal problem that the proposed disclaimers and employee receipts
are attempting to resolve is whether an implied agreement not to
terminate without cause can be inferred from the handbook and/or other
employee documents. The most effective way to avoid the problem
altogether is to require each employee to execute a written employment
agreement stating that employment is <A
HREF="http://www.courttv.com/legalhelp/business/workplace/660.html">
at-will</a> and that any progressive discipline procedures that the
employer may employ to improve the performance of an employee are
discretionary and do not constitute a waiver or limitation of the
at-will employment relationship. If the contract has an integration
clause, most courts will refuse to consider parole evidence that
contradicts the contract's at-will provision and will rule, as a matter
of law, that termination with or without cause does not give rise to an
action for breach of contract. The handbook/receipt provisions stating
that employment is at-will sometimes get similar treatment and sometimes
are merely held to be elements for the jury to consider in determining
whether an implied employment agreement existed, Given the availability
of word processing, the administrative cost of preparing written
employment contracts would appear to be far outweighed by the expense of
litigating handbook provisions.<p>

I agree with you. I'm surprised at how often employers shy away from
contracts, because they think they will be locked in -- when the
opposite can be true. I would be curious, though, to hear what others
think about the adhesion contract notion, when the contract is standard,
and all employees are required to sign. I understand that conceptually
this is no different from a handbook (which is adhesive, standard,
etc.), but I wonder whether the courts might not construe a mandatory,
uniform contract for lower level employees to be repugnant, in some
way.<p>

Peter, could you give us the language you use for your integration

Is there any cause to be concerned that if an employee signed a

this might be found to be a written alteration of the original
contract?<p>

Subject: Fixed term contract<p>

I would go even further and give every employee a contract for a fixed
term of one year, with an option in either party to terminate the
contract on notice. I would also provide that the employer will pay the
employee a modest sum (say $1,000) if it elects to terminate. That may
create some emotional distress for some clients, but in the long run
they would be money ahead. What's the big deal about making everyone
employees at will? It sounds bad and it accomplishes little that a one
year contract would not.<p>

Subject: Flexibility<p>

Most of our clients seem to prefer not to have formal contracts with
each of their employees, and one of the purposes of the disclaimers in a
handbook is to avoid creating one. (As noted elsewhere, that is only one
of the purposes). Our experience is that properly worded disclaimers
give the employer greater flexibility than contracts do, and they have
worked to avoid litigation while preserving the good communications
aspects of handbooks. While definite term (i.e., one-year) agreements
make sense for some employees, and indeed are often used, they don't
seem to suit all, or even most employment situations, as well as the at
will concept.<p>

With regards to the earlier question whether an agreement at hire
stating the relationship to be at will could be construed as an adhesion
contract, I would think that in order to be unenforceable on that ground
it would also have to contain unconscionable terms, and merely stating
the statutory presumption of at will employment applies would not meet
that test.<p>

I think your point is well taken, Theodore. The follow up question for
me is whether a mandatory arbitration provision (a fair and square one,
using -- say -- AAA [American Arbitration Association] rules, damages
according to law, "conscionable" time limits, etc.) would make it
unconscionable. Perhaps the answer is more likely to be no if it's
limited to claims of breach of contract; more likely to be yes, if it
attempts to incorporate discrimination claims -- but then, if that's the
answer, most employers would probably say, "Why bother?" And I'd have to
agree they were right.<p>

This idea sounds attractive, notwithstanding Maurice's clients'
preferences. But what if the employer needs to change an employment
policy for the company, or institute a new benefit, or create a new rule
or procedure to deal with a new exigency? Could these be accommodated
in a rather static employment contract, even with a one year term?

Subject: Fixed term<p>

A fixed term contract could specify only the employment term and leave
other conditions subject to change, so long as the changes are uniform
and without discrimination. The only downside I can see is that the
employer is required to pay money to cancel the contract before the year
ends, and that is cheap insurance in my book. From a flexibility
standpoint, except for the cost, it is the same as an "at will"
contract.<p>

Subject: When disclaimers not enough<p> 

A recent Alabama Supreme Court case, <I>Amoco Fabrics and Fibers
Company, Inc. v. Robert Hilson</i>, 1995 WL 502999 (Aug. 25, 1995)
illustrates how the best disclaimer language in the world is not enough.
The Court affirmed the trial court's summary judgment in favor of the
employees and half-a-million dollar judgment on a breach of contract
claim that relied on Amoco's vacation pay policy. The Court held the
policy gave rise to a unilateral contract even though the Handbook
contained an express disclaimer of contractual liability. Reason? Amoco
made a crucial change to the policy through a memorandum and
announcement but did not modify the original vacation pay policy itself.
Accordingly, the Court refused to recognize the change and held that the
language in the handbook's original policy was sufficient to constitute
an offer to create a binding unilateral contract.<p> 

This prompts two questions and/or suggestions:<p><OL>

<LI>isn't it crucial that disclaimer language be incorporated throughout
a handbook, or will an isolated introductory statement or About This
Manual policy suffice?<p>

<LI>handbooks should be issued in a loose-leaf format to permit changes
by the issuance of new pages for insertion (many employers like nice
little type-set booklets but 3 months later when they want to change the
policy they are unwillingly to go through the added expense of
reprinting its employee handbooks and think a addendum or memorandum
will suffice).</ol><p>

Subject: Severance<p>

Neil, I'm not sure this option really "costs" anything other than the
equivalent of a reasonable severance pay policy. If an at-will employee
is terminated for misconduct, an employer wouldn't pay severance, and I
assume you would not require an employer termininating [for misconduct]
one of your basic contract employees to pay the "liquidated damages"
provision -- or would you?<p>

Subject: Written employment contracts<p>

The issue of adhesion merely provides that ambiguous language will be
construed against the drafter of the document. Most courts will hold
that a provision stating that employment is "at-will" and explaining
that either party has the right to terminate the employment relationship
at any time without cause or notice, is not ambiguous. Even if the court
admits evidence to "explain" the ambiguity, the parol evidence rule
prohibits an interpretation that contradicts the plain language of the
contract.<p> 

The language in an integration clause in an employment contract does not
need to differ from language used in other types of contracts. The
clause should state that the agreement is intended to be the final and
complete expression of the agreement between the parties, to supercede
all prior written, oral, an implied agreements, negotiations and
understandings, that no party is relying on any statement or promise not
contained in the agreement, and that any modification must be in writing
and executed by the parties.<p> 

It is true that employees can attempt to offer evidence of subsequent
agreements to the contract, though this problem is partially solved by
the "modifications must be in writing and signed" provision of the
integration clause. The contract can provide that the handbook or other
personnel documents are merely advisory, can be bypassed at the
discretion of the employer, and that were a contradiction exists, the
contract will control. In termination cases, the key dispute will be
progressive discipline policies. If the written contract states that the
procedures are discretionary and failure to utilize such procedures does
not constitute a breach of the agreement, the employee will have
difficulty by-passing the language of the contract.<p> 

The best contracts that I've seen are updated each year as part of the
review process. This keeps any of the information, such as salary,
position, or supervisor from becoming obsolete. Each subsequent contract
supercedes anything that happened during the prior year. So judges would
view execution of five successive contracts containing at-will
provisions as more persuasive evidence of at-will employment than a
single five year contract. One problem with a fixed term of contract is
that if the company forgets to renew it, the court is going to look to
conduct after the period ended to evaluate the rights of the parties.<p>

In my opinion, Employers who believe that a handbook offers greater
"flexibility" than a fully integrated written at-will employment
contract are missing the point. By failing to specify, unequivocally, in
a binding contract that employment is at-will, employers invite
litigation concerning the terms of employment. Some judges will grant
summary judgment, some will not. A written contract, with an attorneys
fees clause, will dissuade most plaintiff's attorneys from bringing the
case in the first place. A written at-will employment contract will
vastly simplify the preparation of the motion for summary and will
greatly increase the likelihood that the motion will be granted.<p> 

The employment contract does not have to specify every term of
employment. Benefits can be specified by addendum or the documents that
contain the terms of employee benefits can be specifically incorporated
by reference.<p> 

Most California courts will uphold arbitration clauses. The State courts
generally do not hesitate to enforce broad clauses such as the NASD "all
matters arising out of employment" to require arbitration of
discrimnation and other statutory claims. The Ninth Circuit uses a
"knowing agreement to arbitrate" standard that merely requires that the
arbitration clause make it clear that statutory discrimination claims
are included. A clear description of the types of causes of action that
are subject to arbitration will frequently be enforced.<p>

Subject:  Written contracts<p>

While I fully agree with Peter's recommendation on written agreements, I
have to wonder how many employers actually take that step. I suppose
much depends on the characteristics of the employer and industry, e.g.
is it a mature company with employees who expect to stay until they
retire, or is it a startup where it is the norm and expectation that
employees will come and go. Also, what has been the history of
litigation with former employees?<p> 

I expect that in many companies there would be resistance to the idea of
annual contracts for one or more of the following reasons:<p><OL>

<LI>it dumps cold water on the romance phase of the employment
relationship;<p>

<LI>it is too legalistic;<p>

<LI>it adds to administrative burdens to have annual agreements or
renewals; and/or (often unstated)<p>

<LI>it is not our primary goal to make life easier for the
lawyers.</ol><p>

It is with these realities in mind that a well-drafted handbook plays an
important role in the relationship.<p>

Subject: fixed or at will<p>

I agree with the wonderful notion that fixed contracts "pour cold water
on the romance aspect of the relationship". But it is the promises
motivated by "romance" that gets the employer in trouble, the same as in
the matrimonial context.<p> 

I would pay severance to the employee that the employe[r] thought it
terminated for misconduct. Sometimes the employer is wrong and sometimes
it is right but can't prove it. Paying everyone saves money in the long
run.<p>

You can write your at-will contracts any way you want, but I don't think
there is any way you can keep the disgruntled ex-employee out of court
claiming public policy, implied covenant of good faith or some other
cockamamie theory. If the people get some sort of termination pay, the
employer starts off looking fair-minded. I like to grab the high ground
early.<p>

Subject: Written employment contracts<p>

The majority of the Silicon Valley employers that I have dealt with do
not have formal written employment contracts, but lots of Silicon Valley
firms put an at-will clause in their offer letters and require that new
employees countersign the letter. Some of the offer letters contain
abbreviated integration clauses. The at-will-clause-in-offer-letter
approach does not appear to hinder the romance stage of the relationship
because everyone believes the relationship will last forever.<p> 

When a breach of implied contract or implied covenant case is brought,
the employer argues that whatever at-will clauses exist, whether in the
employment application, the offer letter, the employee handbook, the
receipt for the employee handbook, the stock option agreement, are
controlling. The employee argues that the clauses are merely one of the
factors affecting "the reasonable expectation of continued employment."
Some judges grant summary judgment on nothing more than a handbook
at-will clause. Other judges require more.<p> 

If the employee has executed the document containing the at-will
language, the employer will argue that the document is an employment
contract that is at least partially integrated on the issue of
termination and the chances that summary judgment will be granted
increase substantially. If the document actually purports to be an
employment offer or employment agreement, as opposed to an employment
application or handbook receipt, and contains an integration clause,
summary judgment becomes fairly certain. If a an employer has a standard
contract containing a prevailing party attorneys' fee provision, then a
contract based law suit is unlikely, and if an action is brought, the
summary judgment motion will be extremely short and the employer will
probably be awarded fees pursuant to the contract.<p> 

When mergers take place, some Silicon Valley employers have the
employees of the acquired firm countersign form "offer letters" that
offer a position with the merged entity, with same job title, duties,
and salary provided by the prior employer, and which contain an at-will
provision and integration clause. If the employees are concerned about
layoffs, they do not hesitate to sign the letter.<p>

Management acceptance would probably improve if the contracts appear to
primarily address business concerns such as non-compete/severance
agreements to salesmen or proprietary information/invention agreements
to engineers and scientists. The perceived need for such procedures
would probably deflect some resistance.<p>

Subject: Something for nothing<p> 

I may have read this thread a little [too] quickly, but my immediate
reaction is that universal employment contracts is an intriguing idea,
but not one that I could see implementing at any co. with which I am
familiar.<p>

I don't know a single company that has its act together enough to keep
renewing the contracts annually or updating them regularly to account
for changed circumstances (e.g. promotions). And if you don't renew, it
seems to me that you've created the worst sort of negative implication.
Worse, if you've relied on the contract at the expense of the at will
language typical of a handbook, you may be really letting yourself in
for trouble. Conversely, if you have the handbook language, it seems a bit
belt & suspender-y.<p>

I also can't see handing this document labeled "contract" to about-to-be
employees, having them read it, and having them come to the
understanding that even though it says "contract", which they understand
to mean something like "binding commitment", what it really commits to
is no commitment. "Romance" or not, I don't think it's a good thing to
start a relationship by appearing to try to pull a fast one. Let me
hasten to add that I am not suggesting that that is the intent, but it
seems to me like a reasonable conclusion for an employee to reach. In
our industry, employees expect to sign nondisclosure agreements, and
many understand that they need to sign noncomps [non-compete
agreements]. Beyond that, a "contract" is viewed as the kind of benefit
only the bigwigs get to protect themselves if they get the axe. To label
a document a "contract" and have it provide the opposite (more or less)
just seems like a red flag.<p>

<H2>Sexual Harassment Nuances</h2>

We've all heard so much about sexual harassment litigation -- and
after <I>Weeks v. Baker & McKenzie</i> case, et al., I suspect
companies are far more sophisticated about establishing policies
to prevent abuse.<p>

But where are the nuances? What remains problematic, and how can
handbooks address these issues. For example, take a look at 
<A  HREF="http://www.courttv.com/seminars/handbook/romantic.html">
Allan Weitzman's policy on "Romance" in the workplace</a>.<p>

Subject: Sexual Harassment Nuances<p> 

One nuance concerns the employer's <STRONG>NOT</strong> stating, at the
conclusion of the no-harassment policy, that disciplinary action will be
taken against the harasser "if harassment is found to have occurred." If
the policy so states, there is an argument that the employer is
constrained from taking disciplinary action if something short of
harassment is found to have occurred, that is, inappropriate behavior
that may not quite cross the line to being full-blown harassment. Or, if
the employer does take disciplinary action following a harassment
investigation, the "victim" can argue that there must have been illegal
harassment (for which the employer may be strictly liable, at least in
California). The solution: conclude the policy in the employee handbook
by stating that discipline will be taken "if harassment or other
inappropriate conduct is found to have occurred."<p>

Subject: Sexual Harassment Nuances<p>

As Executive Director of a large urban bar and a former civil rights
litigator, I must say that I continue to be surprised that large, well,
<I>most</i> legal employers continue to have great difficulty dealing
with partners, particularly rainmakers, who engage in sexual harassment.
They may well have policies that deal with it in great detail, but in
general I think that the emphasis on the bottom line, together with the
influx of laterals and exit of some "elder statesmen" who may have
exerted some real beneficent influence in some firms -- has created a
climate where sexual harassment by partners, especially the sort of
"shark" litigators in their mid-40's, is very poorly dealt with. Many
management lawyers point out that unless that partnership writes into
the partnership agreement that a partner can be ousted for harassment
(and by far less than the 90+% it took under the Baker & McKenzie
partnership agreement) and otherwise put real economic sanctions in for
partners who harass, the problem will not get a great deal better. It's
interesting, and hardly surprising to note that the California State Bar
Survey of Women Lawyers several years ago found that harassment
decreases as the percentage of women in the firm increases. All the more
disheartening, then, to see the recent studies that show that the
percentages of women partners in firms have stalled and they remain, at
best, at the penultimate ranks.<p>

Subject: Sexual Harassment Nuances<p> 

Another nuance of no harassment policies is that an employer's
responsibilities to prevent harassment (at least in California) extend
beyond the employer's own employees. Thus, an employer's no harassment
policy should extend to actions by clients, vendors, customers and the
like. In addition, some no harassment policies unnecessarily limit the
reporting olbigations to harassment that is actually experienced by an
employee. We take the position that employees should report harassment
that they experience <STRONG>OR WITNESS</strong>. The importance of this
requirement is heightened if the witnessing employee is a supervisor, as
the employer is deemed to have "knowledge" of harassment commensurate
with the knowledge of its supervisory employees.<p>

Subject: requiring informers on sex harassment<p> 

I would be leery of a policy which too greatly encouraged non-targets of
harassing behavior to make formal complaints. After all if the conduct
is consensual or welcome, a complaint and followup could be viewed as an
invasion of privacy by the employer, particularly in a privacy happy
state like California.<p>

Subject:  Sexual Harassment Nuances<p> 

Judith's earlier comment is well taken. It is very easy, not only in the
harassment portion of the handbook, but in other areas as well, to use
legal phrases as shortcut definitions. The problem is exacerbated if
these phrases find their way into investigative reports -- they could be
read as admissions by the employer. Although courts have ruled that an
employer can impose stricter standards of conduct on employees than the
law requires, such that prohibited "harassment" subject to discipline
under the handbook need not amount to a violation of Title VII, see
<I>Chalmers v. Quaker Oats</i> (7th Cir.), having to explain that to a
judge or jury could be avoided.<p>

In reply to Robert Zielinski's comment on investigating potentially
consensual behavior following a tip by others, I say, better safe
(checking it out) than sorry. The employer can be discreet by not
seeking to know more than is required to satisfy legitimate workplace
concerns. Even if the conduct is mutually consensual, the fact that it
has drawn attention by others in the workplace is some reason for the
employer to be concerned. Even in California.<p>

I'd be interested to know what you-all think of legislation currently

with respect ot sexual harassment to include independent contractors.
This issue will be brought before our Board of Directors quite soon.<p>

Returning to the original question, we have always cautioned employers
that the vagaries of NLRB [National Labor Relations Board] and court
pronouncements on solicitation rules create certain unavoidable risks in
drafting any written policy on this issue. Nevertheless, for at least
the last 10 years, the Board has been fairly consistent on the "working
time" (for solicitation by employees) and "working areas" (for
distribution) formulation and our model policy on these points has had
no difficulty. The <I>Mead</i> case dealt with a slightly different
issue -- buttons and t-shirts -- on which the NLRB has developed
different rules prohibiting total bans, and which the employer there
tried unsuccessfully to get away with. We do not recommend publishing
policies which contradict NLRB law. Another area where the rules are
still a little unsettled is the prohibition of soliciting by
non-employees, post-Lechmere, at least for some employers who have
special access issues, and for other employers who want to discriminate
in favor of selected (usually charitable) solicitors.<p>

Subject: United Way Ghosts<p>

Ted, thanks for raising this issue. I think it's still quite thorny.<p>

In the '70s and early '80s, back before the shenanigans of its
now-exiled leader Wm. Aramony finally hit mainstream press, United Way
used <I>unbelievable</i> tactics to get exclusive rights to solicit at
worksites -- esp. large corporate sites. Many other major charities --
including the Am Heart Assn and Am Cancer Society -- were effectively
shut out of many worksites.<p>

I know it's better now, but the question remains: how does an employer
"do good" by allowing on-site solitications or payroll deductions,
without "doing harm" by overt or subtle pressure on employees to
contribute, and/or by shutting everybody out or only supporting
"establishment" charities? (e.g., When I was a graduate student working
three jobs to stay in school, and working as a cashier at a major
supermarket chain, my supervisor <I>intensely</i> pressured me to
contribute my "fair share" so his dept. would have "100%.")<p>

One solution that has emerged that I think works well is "employer
matches" to employee donations. It is less coersive, and can be
structured so that the employer and employee have much more choice.<p>

And this is just anecdotal, but I sense that, at least in smaller
companies, priority is given to charities where employees are actively
volunteering. Should that be a criteria? And I also see companies taking
on charitable projects as a company -- where everybody dives in and does
more than just write checks. Maybe a "cafeteria" plan of several choices
is the way to go -- but is that impractical? Hard to administer?<p>

There are several "loyalty" issues that should be covered: No conflicts
of interest, No insider trading, At employment there should be a
confidentiality agreement signed, and the employee should be reminded of
the importance of maintaining confidential information in confidence
during and after employment. It is also appropriate to do some
education about not inadvertently revealing trade secrets to competitors
or the press.<p>

Subject: Loyalty <p>

Jerry's question raises an issue arising out of the Supreme Court's
<I>Town & Country</i> decision which found paid union organizers to be
"employees," and put off questions of what constitutes a conflict of
interest in the context of union organizing. The Court decision arguably
allows employers to enforce a duty of loyalty, but employers are left
entirely at sea as to what that means or how they can enforce it. <I>See
also Willmar Electric v. NLRB</i> (D.C. Cir. 1993). The safest approach
would be to define the duty using the traditional types of policies set
forth in the preceding comment, particularly where it can be shown that
such policies are commonplace in firms who are unconcerned about union
organizing. Some of the nastier tactics being used by union salts,
however, may not be fully covered by such policies, and it is unclear
what the NLRB will tolerate. For example, whether employers can insist
that employees not solicit co-workers to quit (believe it or not) is an
issue now pending before the Board. The IBEW manual frankly states that
one of their goals is to drive non-union employers out of the market,
yet the Board policy implicitly requires employers to ignore this
"disloyal" objective when confronted with an IBEW organizer/applicant.
Until the after-effects of T&C are more settled, employers confronted
with salting must draft any loyalty policy with extreme care, and I have
not seen any such specific policy tested in this context.<p>

With respect to solicitation to other employees to quit and or go to a
competitor see <I>Mccallister v. Kastella</i>, 1992 WL 14653 and
<I>Augut v. Aegis</i>, 565 N.E. 2d 415 dealing with employees breach of
fiduciary duties owed to their employers by attempting to "cripple the
employer or former employer". In the case of salters would the NLRA
[National Labor Relations Act] preempt state law?<p>

<H2>Probationary Periods</h2>

How about that hardy perennial, the probationary period? Are you
for or against having them in the handbook. Our view is that the
employer gets some mileage out of them, and most employees and
EEO agents seem to understand that a short service employee has
less ability to complain about a discharge in general, and
particularly if there is a clearly stated probationary
requirement. At the same time, we make clear that completion of
the probation (introductory period, whatever) does not alter the
employee's
<A HREF="http://www.courttv.com/legalhelp/business/workplace/660.html">
at will</a> status, which strikes some people as
inconsistent, but it seems to work. Perhaps as important, but
often overlooked, is a provision that the probation can be
extended at the discretion of the employer (so employees who get
past the "magic" day before the supervisor remembers to terminate
them cannot claim to have escaped probation). In the same vein,
and again overlooked, is that any review requirements imposed on
supervisors should be left open to more frequent or less frequent
occurrences than specified, because supervisors seem to never
meet the timetables specified in the handbook.<p>

Subject: Probationary Periods<p>

I think the bigger problem with probationary periods is the false
expectation they create. First, with employees, who think that if
they're off probation, it means something, regardless of the
disclaimer re: at-will. (And, I'd have to say, they would seem to
have a point: what <I>is</i> the difference between probation and
non-probation? Yes, of course, something about benefits and about
notice, but does it have any substantive significance? If not,
then why the label "probation"?) Second, with supervisors. They
<I>can't</i> terminate even probationary employees at whim; there are
EEO protections, as well as privacy protections, whistleblower
protections, public policy protections, implied contract
protections, etc. Supervisors tend to be sloppier with
probationary terminations because they think they can do it
freely, when in fact, they can't. It seems to me the EEOC (or
whoever) is just as understanding if the employer says, "This
brand new employee (only with us 3 months) just didn't seem to be
working out," as if the employer says, "This 'probationary'
employee just didn't seem to be working out."<p>

Subject: orientation<p>

I think it was Mark Twain who said that when in doubt, resort to
the truth. Here, I think the truth is that the word "orientation"
fits the purpose of a "probationary period" without building in
any expectations that things will be different after the period
is over.<p>

Subject: Probationary Periods <P>

I agree that "probationary period" conveys the wrong meaning to
employees and supervisors. I have my clients tell their employees
that they're always on probation -- in the sense that they always
have to prove their value to the department and the company on
the job -- just like their supervisors and managers, and
ultimately the Company have to prove their respective values to
the ultimate consumer of their seer vices. At the same time
orientation periods are of some use, if employees understand that
there are no commitments before or after the orientation period
ends. But then what is the significance of orientation? The
employee can always quit without prior notice if he or she finds
the job unpalatable. And, so long as the employer has made the
employee's "at will" status clear from the outset (like on the
employment application and in the opening paragraphs of the
handbook), the employer can still terminate an employee who
doesn't work out.<p>

Subject: it's psychological<p>

When someone first comes to work, they like the idea of a period
where they feel they can get their sea legs. Otherwise, you are
right that there is no legal purpose to the period. Perhaps
employers should rethink whether they should have such a
period.<p>

Subject: Familiarization not probation<p>

I recognize that employers have an emotional need to have an
introductory period for the new worker and the bosses to get to
know each other. However, calling it "probation" is sure death if
the employer wants to claim that the workers are employees at
will. You can try to satisfy the employers by calling the period
a "familiarization period" in which the employer and the employee
are getting to know each other, without hinting that the
employee's job security increases in any way after the initial
period comes to an end. I was able to sell this theory to my
clients while I was in practice, but that was awhile ago.<p>

This leads into the thicket of "employee evaluation". I'd be interested
how you feel this should best be handled--what works and what doesn't,
and whether you actually practice in your own workplace what you preach

Subject: Probationary Periods<p>

We advise clients to refer to the probationary period as an
"introductory period" to avoid application of state law cases (Alabama)
which have held that the term "probationary" suggests if the employee
survives the period he or she is "off probation" and therefore entitled
to "something more" (i.e., implied contract or promise of continued
employment).<p> 

We mention the introductory period in three places in an employee
handbook:<p><OL>

<LI>In the Employment Classification policy to distinguish regular
full-time employees and regular part-time employees from full-time or
part-time employees still in their introductory period who may not be
entitled to the same benefits;<p>

<LI>a separate Introductory Period policy with the double talk
disclaimer language I admit is confusing but deem crucial to defend
against the cases mentioned above (the company reserves the right to
terminate the employment relationship at-will before or after successful
completion of the introductory period); and<p>

<LI>In each benefit policy which differentiates the level of benefit
based on employment status. I will try to put models of these three
policies in the model section.</ol><p>

Subject: Probationary Periods<p>

For years I conscientiously removed probationary periods from clients'
draft manuals. Then I came to realize that, whatever the legal angles,
the idea of a trial period does have meaning in the workplace and people
generally understand that when you take a job, you are on probation
until they decide whether they want you. Also, benfits often don't
start, and vacation doesn't accrue, for some initial period. Now I try
to give clients the alternatives and, if they choose keep a probationary
period, accept their choice with a good grace.<p>

I will be happy to send Monica a copy of our language, which actually
uses the term "provisional" or "introductory" period, which doesn't make
any difference as far as I'm concerned. I second what Laura just said.
It may not be completely logical, but the probationary period has value,
so why not use it (with the proper qualifications mentioned above).<p>

Subject: It's the Expectation!<p>

I still think the answer to Maurice's question is the false sense of
security on the part of management, false expectation on the part of the
post-probationary employee that probation (or privisional or
familiarization or orientation) periods create. Re: Dru's question about
performance evaluations: do you mean during the probationary period? If
not: (and to answer your easier question), yes, we at Corbett & Kane do
have a performance evaluation program for all but partners, that is, for
associates, support staff, legal assistants and administrators. And for
the most part, we try hard to practice what we preach, and sometimes we
even succeed!<p>

Date: Fri Jan 26 18:50:47 1996<br>
Subject: What is probation?<p>

Bottom line in my view is that if the employer has a "probationary
period", the employee gains additional job security on completion of
probation than he or she had previously. That is certainly what
employees expect, and if they don't get it, they get upset and go see
lawyers. If the employer is not willing to give a greater degree of job
security (and that need be all the way to "good cause"), it should call
the introductory period something else.<p>

In light of cases such as the <I>Randi M. v. Livingston School
District</i> (Ca.) and the <I>Jerner v. Allstate Insurance</i>
(Fla.) cases, where the courts allowed misrepresentation claims
to proceed against former employers who did not fully disclose
misconduct of individuals they gave glowing references, what
should an employer provide in its handbook on this subject? Is it
still worth checking references when it is highly probable that
nothing meaningful will be learned? Should an employer continue
to give references? What ground rules should it follow?<p>

Sad to say, but prudent employers have no choice other than to
give "references" that merely confirm that a person was employed
by them from date A to date B, period. They should not even
indicate whether the employee resigned or was terminated or
retired or whatever. Here in Missouri, there is a Service Letter
Statute that makes the employer state the reason that the
employee was terminated, but that is a rare situation.<p> 

I see no reason why the subject of references to future employers
should be mentioned in the employee handbook at all, but I could
be talked out of that view if someone else came up with a good
reason.<p>

This is one of those areas where the reality simply doesn't comport with
the theory. In hiring someone, as we all know, telephone references
quite often reveal truly important things that dramatically alter an
otherwise rosy picture created by a resume, written letters of
recommendation and even an interview. Therefore, as an employer, I find
reference checks to be critical, and that most employers continue to be
astonishingly frank. Even when not frank, the tone of voice, the sort of
non-verbal communication of <STRONG>PROBLEM</strong> seems to come out
loud and clear. On the other side of the issue is the problem when you
are called for a reference by a good friend, say the Executive Director
of some struggling race discrimination non-profit who is hiring for a
critical position and who is truly relying on your word and to whom it
feels simply untenable to give the standard response. How is the
situation changed if the applicant has included named references on a
resume, or given them to you orally upon request?<p>

One means which can be used to combat this problem is for the hiring
employer to require that the applicant sign a waiver of defamation type
liablity in favor of the employer from whom the reference will be
requested. While there are some problems in releasing the reference
from a liability that hasn't yet occurred, it can workinsome states and
with careful drafting. This doesn't directly solve the issue of
potential liability to third parites for "negligent reference" but if
you can truly tell all, maybe that problem recedes. Short of such a
system, it seems the safest thing to do is simply not give references at
all.<p>

I've toyed with the thought of giving departing employees a menu of
choices. That is, to tell the employee what the Company will say
regardless of whether or not the employee wants it released (e.g., dates
of employment, last position held), and then to give the employee (in
writing) the option of having the company release certain additional
information, such as the last performance rating. Of course, for this,
the employee would have to sign an authorization to release the
additional information. Then, when the reference request comes in (in
writing, of course, or else nothing is provided), the employer releases
the menu of choices (the menu itself, with the boxes checked or not
checked), and the information to be released. If the employee is
terminated for something serious (threats of violence, harassment,
embezzlement), that information would be provided regardless of the
employee's menu selection. If what's released is the truth (this
<I>IS</i> why the employee was fired), and the employee is advised of
the fact that this information will be released (so there are no
surprises), and the information is released only upon proper request (so
no invasion of privacy), what's the realistic risk? (Even in California,
where we do, after all, have a qualified privilege?)<p>

We ask our departing employees to sign a form which authorizes us to
give a reference to a potential future employer. If they fail to elect
or sign the form, we give nothing more than the standard information
regarding their dates of hire and termination, salary, position, etc.
The reference problem has become a thorny one. However, one possibility
is to ask the third-party who is requesting a substantive reference to
have the potential employee sign a waiver so that you can speak
honestly, albeit carefully. We have done this in the past, and it has
been successful.<p>

Regardless of the merits of a reference policy, and we generally favor
the "neutral" reference in all but the most unusual cases, the question
for this panel should be what, if anything the handbook should say about
it. The Venable model proposes to say nothing unless the employer is
required to give references by applicable state law, because the
handbook is for employees, not those who (by definition) are former
employees. In addition, a statement that only neutral references will be
given can create problems if a supervisor violates the policy. Having
said that a reference policy is not necessary, we have drafted or
approved carefully worded policies for some clients who prefer to say
something on the subject. The policies can serve the limited purpose of
putting employees on notice that their employer accepts no obligation to
provide them with references, or state that a release from the employee
will be required, etc.<p>

While the advisability of discussing the employer's views of references
in the handbook might be argued, for the reasons stated above, some
employers include them to advise managers of its expectations, and to
have something these managers can point to when they decline to give
references. That said, it certainly could be contained in a manager's
handbook or in formal HR policies.<p>

<H2>Handbook Versus Goals</h2>

<H2>The Ultimate Employee Handbook -- A Workshop</h2>

<H3>Workshop Discussion Thread</h3>

From: Monica Bay -- Counsel Connect - San Francisco<br>
Date: Fri Jan 19 02:53:27 1996<br>
Subject: Handbooks v. Goals<p>

Last Append:Sun Jan 21 22:43:27 1996<p>

Many companies have adopted strong policies against
discrimination on the basis of race, sex, etc...<p>

And many employers have pledged to actively increase opptys for
women, minorities, gays, disabled, etc...<p>

What should be in <I>handbooks</i> and what should be
<I>goals</i> or philosophies articlulated elsewhere.<p>
For example, many SF [San Francisco] employers have adopted the
Bar Assn. of SF's minority goals and timetables. Do these belong
in employee handbooks -- or outside -- and why?<p>

<hr><p>

Appended by: Drucilla Stender Ramey -- Bar Assoc. of S.F. - San Francisco<br>
Date: Sun Jan 21 22:43:27 1996<br>
Subject: Handbooks v. Goals<p>

I know a great deal more about the "goals" approach than about personnel
manuals per se, but our bar association spends a huge amount of time
trying to persuade firms to adopt concrete policies and goals which are
intended to make for an environment more hospitable and conducive to
diversity. I suppose that the two approaches should increasingly
intersect. For example, in the sexual orientation area, a set of
aspirational goals adopted and sent out to our 400 sponsor firms and
corp. law depts. included extention of bereavement and sick leave, as
well as health care coverage, to cover domestic partners, as well as a
series of policies about "family" attendance at firm social events,
recognition of holidays that are significant to the gay/lesbian
community, firm payment of dues of gay/lesbian bar ass'ns and the like.
Very recently, a great many firms in San Francisco have jumped on the
bandwagon of a few earlier pioneers in providing domestic partner
ins[urance] coverage, and their insistence on including this has abruptly
changed the climate for health insurance companies offerring it (in part
because their experience in offering it to large public employers has
proven to be de minimis). Obviously, once non-discrimination takes the
form of a tangible employee benefit in an organization, it must properly
be in the personnel manual, but less tangible hortatory or aspirational
matters are rarely found beyond the required non-discrimination jargon. I
should note, though, that even though the tangible, concrete policies in
the manual should include part-time policies for childcare, eldercare,
and/or whatever else the firm may provide in this regard, it is my
impression that even firms which have publicly stated that they have
adopted our bar's 
<A HREF="http://www.courttv.com/seminars/handbook/altwork.html">
Model Flexible Worktime Policy</a> have not necessarily
put it into their manual, and, therefore, most people in the firm don't
know about it, which may or may not be why it's not there. (the guts of
the policy is to provide for a presumption for part time work, at pro
rata pay, for BOTH partners and associates, without going off the
partnership track). Our bar's Goals and Timetables for Minority Hiring
and Advancement might well go in as examples of efforts the firm has
made in aid of its commitment to non-discrimination. I know the firms
use their signing up to the Goals (and 100 of them did) in their
promotional literature in law school recruitment.<p>

<H2>[What is the Correct] Level of Detail in Policies?</h2>

Last Append: Tue Jan 23 21:49:46 1996<p>

When writing policies, is less better than providing extensive

policies to only situations specified in a policy.<p>

On some matters, such as vacation policy or sick leave, I believe
that extensive detail is both necessary and appropriate. On
discipline policy, which is where the employer can get into
trouble, prudence would dictate only general statements.<p>

Appended by: Matthew Vega -- Sirote & Permutt - Birmingham<br>

Subject: Level of Detail in Policies<p>

I agree simple is best...however handbooks written like executive
summaries tend to cut corners, leaving out crucial disclaimer language.
Shorter is not always clearer. Contingencies should be anticipated in
advance to ensure consistent and fair application of policies
(especially with regard to leave policies, and hours of work policies).
The handbook should be detailed enough that the employer does not have
to prepare a second administrative manual to implement the policy
(centralizing company policy is invaluable). The only exception I can
think of to this rule is benefit policies (quick reference to insurance
booklets, etc. is appropriate in an employee handbook I think). Another
place I think the shorter the better is the Employee Obligations section
of the handbook. Disciplinary policies and General Workplace Rules of
Conduct policies should not attempt to be exhaustive but should provide
enough detail and examples to be useful while at the same time
preserving the discretion of management (i.e. progressive discipline not
a formal grievance procedure, don't lock management into a specific
disciplinary actions for a specific act of misconduct).<p>

In Scott, as I recall, the employer specifically mentioned
"demotion" in its handbook as a form of discipline. Thus, it got
caught up in the "good cause" requirements.<p> 

The troublesome issue is whether any discipline short of
discharge should be judicially reviewable. Scott said all
discipline could be attacked in court, and I believe that is a
very bad result.<p>

<H2>Domestic Partner Benefits</h2>

<H2>The Ultimate Employee Handbook -- A Workshop</h2>

<H3>Workshop Discussion Thread</h3>

Date: Mon Jan 22 15:22:03 1996<br>
Subject: Domestic Partner Benefits<p>

Last Append: Wed Jan 24 01:14:52 1996<p>

Dru Ramey has provided us with an excellent <A
HREF="http://www.courttv.com/seminars/handbook/domestic.html">
Model Domestic Partner Health Benefits policy</a> that can be
found in the Workshop library. Today, I received the following
message from the BENEFITS-L listserv mailing list on the
Internet:<p>

<hr>

From: Marzec Mark E Internet<br> 
Date: Mon, 22 Jan 96 15:06:49 EST<br> 
Subject: HEALTH BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEE'S DOMESTIC PARTNER
ARE TAXABLE TO EMPLOYEE.<p>

Has anyone else seen the private letter ruling (LTR 9603011)
released last Friday (1/19/96) in which the Service has ruled that
health benefits provided to an employee's domestic partner, who
does not qualify as a spouse under state law or as a dependent
under section 152(a), will be taxable as wages to the
employee?<p>

This would appear to give problems to companies who have
implemented such benefits nationwide.<p>

Senders Internet Address benefits-l@frank.mtsu.edu<p>

<hr>

Does anyone think, in light of this ruling, that any
handbook that includes a domestic partners health benefits
description should be redrafted to reflect the anticipated tax
consequences of the plan?<p>

<hr><p>

Appended by: Drucilla Stender Ramey -- Bar Assoc. of S.F. - San Francisco<br>
Date: Wed Jan 24 01:14:52 1996<br>
Subject: Domestic Partner Benefits<p>

Our Bar has considered that issue, and we assumed that the benefit would
be taxable. It, therefore, came before our Board as to whether our model
policy should include language indicating that it might well be taxable
and that some employers have opted to pay additional salary to the
employee in question so as to achieve full economic parity with married
employees. However, one general counsel of a very large bank and several
members of large firm management committees objected to inclusion of
such language, maintaining that this would put very large employers in
an untenable situation, that there are all kinds of inequities in the
tax laws that have an impact on employees and, therefore, that this is a
slippery slope. The Board ultimtely deferred to this position, though a
substantial minority did not concur. I should note that BASF itself coun
not, until recently get its insurer to pay for domestic partner coverage
for BASF staff members, so we paid the employees in question an amount
representing the premium for the individual policy AND an additional
amount representing the tax hit on that.<p>

<H2>Employee E-Mail Encryption</h2>

<H2>The Ultimate Employee Handbook -- A Workshop</h2>

<H3>Workshop Discussion Thread</h3>

From: Charles Merrill -- McCarter & English - New Jersey<br>
Date: Mon Jan 22 12:45:57 1996<br>
Subject: Employee E-Mail Encryption<p>

Last Append: Thu Jan 25 07:45:20 1996<p>

At Cloyd's suggestion, I'd like to start a new thread on the subject of
how the employer should address the issue of employee encryption of
e-mail on the Company LAN, when writing the Employee Handbook's chapter
on Company E-Mail (and VoiceMail) policy.<p> 

This question is only partially inspired by my attendance at the RSA
Data Security Conference (on encryption) last week in San Francisco.
Clients have been raising this issue for over a year now.<p> 

The scenario would arise in the context of a fairly typical e-mail
policy, namely: The LAN is the property of the company, to be used
primarily for company purposes, and only incidentally for personal
purposes, to the extent consistent with company purposes.<p> 

The policy would then go on to rebut the expectation of privacy with
respect to stored e-mail messages, warning that employees should not
entrust personal confidences to the LAN, and that the employer retains
the full right to monitor stored (but not to intercept) e-mail messages
(and voicemail messages), as permitted by 18 U.S.C. 2701(c)(1).<p> 

At that point, let's assume the policy goes silent, and omits to specify
whether the employees are permitted to use private systems of encryption
on the LAN. Some employees then begin chatting back and forth with their
private copies of RSA or PGP, and similarly encrypted messages to and
from external e-mail addresses begin to appear.<p> 

What concerns should the Company have, and what solutions might be
proposed by you the Ultimate Handbook advisor?<p> 

Let's simply the question by assuming that the Company is in the private
sector, and in an industry unrelated to law enforcement, defense or
national security.<p>

Subject: Just forbid it?<p>

Is there any reason an employer should not just forbid the unauthorized
use of encryption? While such a policy might fly in the face of a
company's corporate culture, concept of retaining the right to monitor
email is meaningless if the company can't decrypt the email.<p> 

"Authorized use" might be defined to include any use so long as the
employee has escrowed his encryption key with the company. But
enforcement of such a policy might be difficult.<p> 

<hr><p>

Appended by: Theodore Banks -- Kraft Foods<br>
Date: Mon, 22 Jan 96 20:59<br>
Subject: Employee E-Mail Encryption<p>

If the encrypted material is discovered, I assume that the policy would
then be modified to specifically say that no employee may place
encrypted material on a company computer unless specifically authorized
to do so.<p> 

A rule prohibiting all personal use would cover this situation, but I
think that such a policy would be viewed as unreasonable. On the other
hand, a policy allowing "reasonable" use of company computing assets for
personal use is subject to abuse. Nonetheless, I would opt for a policy
allowing for reasonable personal use that does not interference with job
performance, with the caveat that all material placed on the computer
must be readable by the company and may be read by the company.<p>

Subject: Commercial Key Escrow<p>

Although I am a fan of cryptography, I agree with both Cloyd Laporte and
Ted Banks, that it is generally too risky for a Company to allow
employees to use robust encryption on the Company system, unless there
is some mechanism for the Company to have authorized access to the
decryption key.<p> 

A document or message encrypted for privacy with industrial-strength
public-key crypto such as PGP or RSA is gone virtually <I>forever</i> if
the decryption key is not available. Some of the nightmares are:<p><OL> 

<LI>the employee uses her own key-pair to encrypt company info, and
loses her decrypting private key;<p> 

<LI>the employee sends company info to another employee, encrypted with
the public key of the other employee, and that other employee loses his
private key;<p> 

<LI>encrypted messages with attached encrypted documents are discovered,
addressed to suspicious external addresses where there might be interest
in trade secrets, and the sending employee fails or refuses to furnish
the key;<p> 

<LI>disgruntled or at-risk employee systematically encrypts company info
with an ace-in-the-hole blackmail motive;<p> 

<LI>Company is served with valid subpoena or court order for company
data which is unrecoverably encrypted by an employee who is dead, fired,
or recalcitrant.</ol><p> 

Some problems with a flat prohibition policy arise from the company's
legitimate need for secure electronic communication and transmission of
electronic documents, with the currently insecure Internet the only
available company channel, and what to do when senior management decides
that the prohibition on encryption does not apply to senior
management.<p> 

An emerging technological compromise which bears close watching is the
concept of "commercial key escrow," which is analogous to the hated
"Clipper Chip" Escrow Encryption Standard proposed by the Clinton
Administration on April 16, 1993, but with important differences:<p><OL>

<LI>the Company rather than the government holds the escrowed keys;<p> 

<LI>the due process rules for release of escrow are decided by the
Company rather than the Government;<p> 

<LI>the encryption algorithms are the Company's choice, not the
Government's Skipjack algorithm;<p> 

<LI>unlike Clipper, which escrowed the <I>permanent</i> private keys of
the device/user and compromised that private key for all past and future
messages using that key, the commercial scheme escrows only the
<I>session key</i> of each message, which compromises only that message,
not past or future messages.</ol><p> 

With such commercial key escrow technology installed, the e-mail policy
would provide that no encryption will be permitted, except the
encryption officially endorsed and supported by the company with the
escrow feature. The official escrowed cryptosystem would be readily
available to any employee in a position to need legitimate security for
company info.<p> 

Without such technology, the company e-mail policy should probably
resemble the laws of France and Russia, which provide basically that
encryption shall not be used without advance approval and deposit of the
decryption keys with the security establishment. If permission is
granted, the encryption encountered on the LAN will need to be
constantly tested with the deposited keys, to control the problem of
undetected change of keys. This scenario is decidedly awkward, and it is
probably unwise, in the absence of a controlled commercial key escrow
scheme, to allow any encryption whatsoever on the Company's system.<p>

Subject: Enforcement<p>

I agree having a policy requiring employees to use the company's
commercial key escrow system would help address some of the problems you
have outlined (Care to draft a sample one for our Handbook Library?). I
also think such a policy might help a company escape a "spoliation"
argument if it is unable to comply with a subpoena because an employee
has used unauthorized encryption techniques.<p> 

But I still see a major problem with enforcement. How does the
commercial system let the company monitor compliance? Does somebody (or
some software) have to examine every file on the server to ensure that
it is encrypted only with the authorized commercial escrow software?
What if I, the disgruntled employee, first encrypt with my personal copy
of PGP, and then re-encrypt with the commercial key escrow?!<p> 

At some point, you have to trust your employees and accept that you are
vulnerable.<p> 

<hr><p> 

Appended by: Charles Merrill -- McCarter & English - Newark<br>
Date: Wed Jan 24 12:10:08 1996<br>
Subject: Enforcement<p>

The sample language regarding encryption is pretty brief, and will look
a little lonely all by itself in the library. Following my summary of a
typical e-mail policy in the first posting in this thread, It's to the
effect of: "Thou shalt not use any encryption on the Company's system
with express prior written permission, and strict compliance with the
terms of such prior written permission." The style and tone will depend
on the Corporate Culture and level of technology, as will the content of
the permission, if it is ever given.<p> 

Cloyd, these enforcement questions are not unique to the online
encrypted environment. How do you know your employees are not secretly
destroying company data? How do you know that your employees are not
shipping out trade secrets written on their underwear?<p> 

It sure helps to have a clear statement that such activity is not
permitted, which helps guide the vast majority of your employees who are
honest and loyal, but may be receiving confusing signals in the absence
of a clear e-mail policy saying that departure will be rewarded by
discipline or dismissal.<p>

As my sample policy language for employee encryption, I hereby
incorporate by reference as a starting point, the excellent "Electronic
Media and Services: Scope of Use" E-mail policy by Margaret Philips of
DHL Systems, Inc., with this paragraph 2.5 in place of the existing
paragraph 2.5:<p>

"2.5 In order to ensure the company's continuous access to information
on the company's system, no employee shall use personal hardware or
software to encrypt any e-mail or voicemail, or any other data stored in
or communicated by the company's system of electronic media, except in
accordance with express prior written permission from the company's
management."<p> 

I fear that if there is an attempt to spell out in the general policy
the circumstances and precautions warranting permission, it will
inevitably have loopholes and will need to be changed too often. General
rules for escrowing keys can be developed more easily in developing
sub-rules for certain classes of employees.<p>

If permission is granted to use truly robust public key encryption
algorithms such as 128-bit PGP or RSA, the private keys need to be
furnished in electronic form along with the pass phrase required for the
employee's operation of her private key, and the permission should make
it clear that management intends to spotcheck messages continuously to
make sure that the private key has not been superseded by another
public/private key pair.<p> 

The really bad news is that having the *private key of the sender* will
not decipher two-party messages because messages are encrypted for
privacy by using the *public key of the recipient* and decrypted by
using the *private key of the recipient*. So messages sent to
non-employees will need to be prohibited, and messages sent to employees
will need to prohibited unless the *recipient* has provided his private
key!! In two party messages the private key of the sender is used to
digitally *sign* messages, and there is almost never a legitimate reason
for the company to be able to digitally impersonate an employee. The
private key of the sender is most useful to control one-party encryption
of stored data.<p>

As discussed above in this thread, the only really effective method of
allowing robust public key crypto on the system and ensuring company
access is a company sponsored system of commercial key escrow of the
*session* key for each message, not the permanent private keys. Such a
system is now being marketed by Trusted Information Systems.<p>

<H2>Union Organizers -- Employees</h2>

<H2>The Ultimate Employee Handbook -- A Workshop</h2>

Does [the recent Supreme Court case] <I>Town and Country</i> render policies
which prohibit employees to be employed by another employer
unlawful?<p>

Appended by: Neil Bernstein -- WA Univ. School/Law - St. Louis<br>

Subject: union organizers<p>

The Supreme Court tried to decide <I>Town and Country</i> narrowly,
limiting it only to a holding that union organizers can be "employees"
the same as everyone else. That being so, I believe there is still room
to argue that they are subject to the same prohibitions against other
employment as everyone else. Interesting question.<p>

Subject: More on Unions<p>

While we're on the topic of Unions, Panelist Maurice Baskin has provided
some sample anti-union handbook language for non-unionized companies.
<I>See <A HREF="http://www.courttv.com/seminars/handbook/unions.html"> A
Few Words About Unions</a></i> in the workshop library. Does anyone feel
that this language is inappropriate?<p>

My guess is that employers would like to put it in, and suggesting it
probably endears a lawyer to clients. But surely an employee is not
going to be swayed on the question of joining a union by language in a
handbook. And if a dispute later arises about whether an employer has
engaged in unfair labor practices, I would not like to have such a
document introduced in evidence.<p>

Subject: Employer free speech<p>

This is still America and an employer has a right to give its general
opinion about unionization. If Section 8(c) of the NLRA means anything,
it's should give a company the right --without fear of a ULP--to voice a
non-threatening opinion that employees do not need a union. I have not
read Maurice's model statement, but I have no doubt he has tailored it
to state the point in a defensible manner.<p> 

On the proposition that employees don't give squat about what an
employer thinks about unions: I'm not sure that's true. I know of
several workplaces where employees signed authorization cards without
any idea that this might rub their employer the wrong way. The
non-union-and-proud-of-it statement may, subconsciously, convince some
employees that supporting a union is disloyal to a somewhat likeable
boss.<p>

Subject: Unions<p>

Since you asked --<p>

We actually provide two options, one a one-paragraph, generally worded
statement and the other a detailed discussion of unions, and I would say
that most of our clients choose the third option of saying nothing.
Regrettably, our experience has been that some employees, when
confronted by card-signing activity, indeed allow themselves to be
pressured into signing a union card on the basis of a misguided belief
that the employer "doesn't care" about the issue one way or the other --
based on the employer's silence. Having the employer's view (protected
by 8(c) of the Act as noted above) expressed in the handbook may avoid
that circumstance. A legal point -- employers must be careful in their
acknowledgement forms not to impose a requirement that the employees
"adhere" to everything in the handbook, because the NLRB held a couple
of years ago that such a requirement, in the context of a policy on
unions, was unlawfully coercive.<p>

Subject: union organizers-employees<p>

I think that regardless of the language in which this kind of thing is
couched, most employees would feel the "chill", whether intended by the
employer or not. Regardless of how the employee felt about unions in
general or about some particular union situation which happens to be
developing, I think the chilling effect of such language might go well
beyond the question of unions and more broadly chill the
employee-employer relationship as a whole.<p>

Frankly, if an otherwise non-threatening statement against unions tends
to "chill" some skittish employees anyway, so much the better for the
employer.<p>

Does anyone include a "whistle blower" policy in a handbook? Does it

A number of companies, including defense employers, have anonymous
"hotlines" they encourage employees to call to report ethics violations
or illegal acts. Beyond that, I would think an open door complaint
policy, coupled with a no-retaliation commitment by the employer, would
accomplish the same result.<p>

<H2>Arbitration [Clauses]</h2>

<H2>The Ultimate Employee Handbook -- A Workshop</h2>

<H3>Workshop Discussion Thread</h3>

From: Neil Bernstein -- WA Univ. School/Law - St. Louis<br> 
Date: Wed Jan 24 16:08:30 1996<br> 
Subject: Arbitration<p>

Last Append: Sat Feb  3 20:56:19 1996<p>

Should not the handbook have a clause providing a grievance procedure
leading to mandatory arbitration for any claims of handbook violation?
Whether or not the handbook is filled with disclaimers, arbitration
provides an avenue for the disgruntled employee that is private and
relatively inexpensive. I think it should be a feature of every
handbook.<p> 

<hr><p>

Appended by: Theodore Banks -- Kraft Foods, Inc. - Northfield<br>
Date: Wed Jan 24 22:46:03 1996<br>
Subject: Arbitration<p>

Having some sort of dispute resolution procedure available to employees
is a good idea; making it "arbitration" is probably inappropriate.<p>

<hr><p>

Appended by: Neil Bernstein -- WA Univ. School/Law - St. Louis<br>
Date: Fri Jan 26 18:27:07 1996<br>
Subject: Why inappropriate?<p>

Why is having a dispute resolution procedure ending in arbitration
inappropriate? If you want to keep employee disputes out of court, there
has to a procedure ending in a final determination by an independent
neutral body. There is, IMHO, no independent neutral body that is more
suitable than arbitration.<p>

<hr><p>

Appended by: Theodore Borromeo -- Sun Microsystems - Mountain View<br>
Date: Fri Jan 26 23:35:28 1996<br>
Subject:  Arbitration<p>

One concern might be that the employer might face a significant increase
in claims being brought and pursued to arbitration, claims that might
not otherwise be significant enough to engender lawsuits. Also,
ADR[Alternative Dispute Resolution] is always an option once in court,
so the employer can wait until then to seek arbitration or mediation.<p>

Perhaps more significantly, as indicated in another thread, there is a
question whether an agreemeent to arbitrate <I>all</i> claims actually
means that. There is not much gained by the employer if, for example,
statutory claims of discrimination, or for wage payments etc. can still
be brought in court.<p>

<hr><p>

Appended by: Maurice Baskin -- Venable, Baetjer - Washington<br>
Date: Sun Jan 28 12:55:23 1996<br>
Subject: Arbitration<p>

The subject of arbitration has been discussed several times in the Labor
and Employment Law discussion group, and a substantial body of case law
has developed on the issue. A growing number of employers believe that
some form of binding ADR is necessary to reduce litigation costs. A
number of courts have deferred to procedurally fair arbitration
agreements, since the <I>Gilmer</i> case. We have included a sample
grievance procedure in our model handbook, but at present, it does not
end in arbitration and most of our clients do not put in such a
requirement. They seem to fear, as noted above, that offering low-cost
arbitration of employment disputes will actually lead to increased
litigation. That could change soon, as more and more employers who do
not have ADR procedures in place are hit with court actions.<p>

<hr><p>

Appended by: Michael P. Maslanka -- Clark, West - Dallas<br>
Date: Sun Jan 28 14:46:03 1996<br>
Subject: implementation<p>

The insertion of an arbitration clause in a handbook--standing alone--is
not a good idea. Rather, the arbitration agreement should be included in
the handbook as one component of an overarching alternate dispute
resolution procedure. For instance, many employers have an open door
policy in the handbook. This could be intergrated with an arbitration
policy and the employees told that they need to exhaust the open door
policy before resorting to arbitration. Also, the policy must be placed
in context for the employees or they will think that the employer is
trying to do you know what to them. So, some language on why arbitration
is a good idea(litigation only makes lawyers rich, etc.)needs to be put
in the handbook.<p> 

<hr><p>

Appended by: Robert Zielinski -- Ross & Hardies - Chicago<br>
Date: Tue Jan 30 02:53:13 1996<br>
Subject: Arbitration<p>

IMO arbitration clauses in handbooks are a bad idea. My guess is that
courts will continue to ratchet back on [the] <I>Gilmer</i> [case] so
that virtually no statutory or common law public policy claims are
arbitrable. So there will be little benefit. On top of that, I think the
existence of an arbitration clause in a handbook would go a long way
toward establishing the handbook as a binding contract of employment. If
the employer did not really intend to be bound in a leglaistic way to
the handbook terms, what is there to arbitrate? The only available
inference is that the Company intended to relinquish its discretion and
that therefore some more objective standards such as just cause are to
be applied.<p>

Date: Wed Jan 31 09:46:07 1996<br>
Subject: Arbitration<p>

I've actually been surprised by the receptivity of California courts to
mandatory arbitration in employment contracts -- even employee
handbooks. I agree that including an arbitration provision "converts" a
handbook to a contract, and such handbooks should be written with that
in mind. Several of our Silicon Valley clients have opted for
arbitration, with their eyes open -- and those that have done so seem
remarkably satisified with it. It's important to make clear from the
outset that the employer's being in arbitration does
<STRONG>not</strong> mean that the employer will win, or that the
employer can limit its damages or shorten the statute of limitations.
It's a <STRONG>forum</strong>[the place where the dispute is decided]
issue, and nothing else. And it does mean that the employer may have to
"litigate" the case having less knowledge about the employee's claim
than has the employee. It also means faster resolution. And it
substantially reduces the likelihood of a runaway verdict. (Especially
if the process provides for selection of arbitrators knowledgeable in
employment law, such as through the AAA's [American Arbitration
Association's] Employment Dispute arbitration rules.) To paraphrase the
VP of HR of one client, who went through a grueling 2-day arbitration
hearing in a wrongful termination case: However it comes out, it was
still much better than being in court. And in this case, the employer
won.<p>

Subject: Separate Agreement<p>

Unless the handbook is a contract of employment, I do not believe that
the mere inclusion of arbitration in the handbook is as enforcable as a
separately signed agreement providing for the final and binding
arbiration of all employment disputes.<p>

Subject:  Handbook v. Contract<p>

Couldn't the employer insert the arbitration language in some other
document which already is an agreement, e.g., the trade secrets
agreement, thereby avoiding making the handbook a contract? What is the
downside to that approach?<p>

are to employers who put policies in handbooks and then fail to monitor
compliance. What happens when an employee is terminated for violating a
policy and it turns out that the policy is broadly ignored? Does it
matter whether the particular violation resulted in a loss to the
company? Should companies avoid inserting policies where it is difficult
to monitor or enforce compliance?<p>

Subject: Failing to comply<p>

There is a practical risk to the employer who says "this is what we do"
(or "don't do), and then who does otherwise. As a general rule, the
employer negates the effectiveness of the handbook at best, and exposes
itself (at least in California) to liability for bad faith and breach of
contract at worst. For example, the employer whose handbook says, "We
evaluate performance annually on the employee's anniversary date), and
then doesn't get around to it, may have independent liability for breach
of contract, and (more likely) will find its hands tied when it tries to
terminate an employee for poor performance. There is also the risk, of
course, of liability for discrimination if the employer enforces a
policy only against some employees. As a general rule: the
<STRONG>best</strong> of all worlds is a well-written handbook that the
employer follows; the <STRONG>worst</strong> is a handbook that the
employer fails to follow. In the middle is no handbook at all -- only a
basic set of benefit descriptions and the legally mandated distributions
and postings.<p>

Subject: Protecting Clients<p>

The best companies have excellent procedures, rigorously train their
supervisors to follow them, and carefully monitor compliance. The
typical company has some of these features, but nobody's perfect. The
client should be made to realize that nothing should go in the handbook
which they will not fully live up to, but if the handbook's language
preserves sufficient employer discretion and flexibility and does not
overpromise, even the "worst case" client will be protected from itself.
That should be the goal of every handbook provision (and management
lawyer).<p>

Does anyone have a model "Internet Use" or "Online Service Use"
policy? Recent surveys suggest that <I>most</i> web browsing is
taking place using company computer systems at the workplace. Of
course, this is not much different from personal use of the
telephone (though it might be less obvious to co-workers -- has
anyone seen the AOL commercial where the worker says "My boss
thinks I'm working on my PC, but actually, I'm goofing off on
AOL"?).<p>

But there are a few differences: One employer I know started to
get complaints from employees that some fellow employees were
displaying offensive graphics on their terminals. As mentioned in
another thread, the LAN can also be used for broad dissemination
of copyrighted works obtained from online services. If an
employee posts to a Usenet Newsgroup, should the company require
a disclaimer that the opinions expressed are those of the poster
and not the company?<p> 

On a related issue, how about policies regarding the installation
and use of personal software on company computers?<p>

Subject: Internet-Online Service Use<p>

Here's one approach that might be considered:<p>

Use of company provided Internet access is intended to be
primarily for business related purposes. Internet access is
monitored, and actual web-site connections are recorded.
Excessive use of company-provided Internet access for
non-business-related purposes will result in loss of access
privileges.<p>

Here's another possibility, in slightly less formal language:<p>

We're allowing you to use the Internet, but we trust that you
won't waste time at work doing stuff that has nothing to do with
our business. Our system automatically tracks the websites you
connect to, so we'll know if you are wasting time. We will warn
you after the first month if we see this stuff going on. If it
continues, we'll advise your boss, who will be pleased to get the
news, since that will mean that he can reduce his department
headcount by one, since you obviously have a lot of time to kill
and not enough work to do.<p>

QUESTION=What are the legal issues regarding the following statement:
"Employees who fail to return to work upon the conclusion of any leave
of absence will be terminated from employment status." Does a policy
such as this exclude an employer from the ADA requirements of
accomodations if an employee qualifies for one?<p>

Subject: ADA v. Handbook<p>

No matter what your handbook says, the employer must comply with ADA. If
the employee has a disability (which need not be the case for someone
returning from a leave of absence), the employer has a duty to
accomodate, if it can do without unreasonable hardship. Inability to
comply with the employer's handbook is not an unreasonable hardship.<p>

Appended by: Judith Keyes -- Corbett & Kane - Emeryville<br>

Subject: Does ADA trump Handbook? No.<p>

It is clear that an employer cannot avoid ADA obligations by creating a
policy purporting to permit it to do so. The ADA requires that employers
provide "reasonable accommodation" to qualified individuals with
disabilities -- and the regulations provide that "reasonable
accommodation" includes flexible leave policies. So. If an employee is
on leave due to a "disability" (which is likely), and the employee needs
a "reasonable" extention of the leave beyond the employer's established
maximum, the employer must "accommodate" the employee by granting the
request. Again, the limitation is the reasonableness of the duration of
the leave (objectively speaking), not an artificial cut-off.<p> 

<hr><p>

Appended by: Neil Bernstein -- WA Univ. School/Law - St. Louis<br>
Date: Wed Jan 31 23:53:15 1996<br>
Subject: No or Yes<p>

Although Judith Keyes subject line states that ADA does not trump the
employer's handbook, the text of her message recognizes that the answer
is really "yes". In fact, the question is not, as she puts it, the
"reasonableness of the duration of the leave", it is whether the
employer can in fact accomodate the employee's need for a longer leave
without undue hardship. Even if the policy is generally reasonable, it
must give way to ADA unless undue hardship is involved. That's a trump
in my book.<p> 


<hr><p>

Appended by: Judith Keyes -- Corbett & Kane - Emeryville<br>
Date: Fri Feb  2 09:38:31 1996<br>
Subject: What's a trump?<p>

Not to quibble, but whether or not a long (unpaid) leave is an undue
hardship doesn't depend on the handbook! If an employer were to say, for
example, that 4 months was the "maximum" leave, and the disabled
employee said "I need 8, and then my therapy will be complete and I can
return to work" -- what difference does the handbook make? I think a
court's analysis as to how hard this 8-month period would be on the
employer would be made without regard to the handbook! But then, I
haven't played bridge in years.<p>

Subject:  Does ADA trump Handbook? No.<p>

The more typical and difficult situation is where the employee
repeatedly gets a doctor's note extending the leave. Is the employer
obligated in this situation to extend leave indefinitely? If the
employee has exhausted any disability leave benefits entitlement and
there are no service-related benefits accruing, so that the termination
is a mere administrative act, and the employer agrees to reconsider the
employee for rehire upon release to work, is there still an ADA issue?
(This assumes the termination policy applies the same way for
non-disability leaves).<p>

Subject: ADA-Family and Medical Leave<p>

As to the issue of ADA/extension of leave...no discussion is complete
without considering the impact of the FMLA. Is the employee on an FMLA
leave? If so the leave will be extended for the FMLA period. The more
problematic issue is whether it is a reasonable accomodation for the
employer to allow additional leave time for someone who is claiming an
ADA disability but who has used all of the FMLA leave. The EEOC seems to
think that would be an appropriate accomodation but the courts have not
yet ruled on this issue. It will be a case by case analysis with no easy
answer to cover all situations.<p>

Doesn't the bottom line (after FMLA and/or state leave such as CFRA)
remain "reasonable accommodation" based on the specific facts? One
employee's extended absence may pose greater hardship than another. And
I think the handbook entry can only hurt (by establishing a minimum),
not help (because there is no max without facts).<p>

<H2>[Employee] Evaluations</h2>

Subject: Evaluations<p>

Last Append: Sat Jan 27 00:01:47 1996<p>

Without getting into the subject of whether periodic employee
evaluations are good or bad, or what they should consist of (a
worthy seminar topic in its own right), there is one aspect of
this issue which creates a potential handbook problem, and where
I find an amazingly large number of handbooks to be deficient. It
is also easily correctable. The problem: the evaluation policy
(and this applies to probationary periods as well) states that
evaluations will be made at a specific time (annually, every six
months, whatever). Many employers (or their supervisors) then
lose track of the anniversary dates, or stop doing evaluations
altogether, or figure that a few days here or there wont make a
difference, or want to do a special evaluation sooner than the
anniversary. Subsequent discipline has been jeopardized in some
court decisions on the theory that the employee would have
improved if the promised evaluation had been delivered as
scheduled. The simple solution (after the statement that reviews
will "normally" be conducted every __ months) is to add:
"Performance reviews may be conducted more or less frequently, at
any time, in the Firm's discretion." [or in accordance with the
needs of the business, etc.]. Another answer, of course, is not
to promise specific evaluation dates at all, but most of our
clients have evaluation systems and want them to be regularly
administered, so the first answer allows that to occur while
preserving necessary flexibility for the employer.<p>

Subject:  Another issue<p>

A colleague once remarked, only half-jokingly, that so many
evaluations are of the "walks on water with lead boots on"
variety that they are meaningless for performance feedback, and
only caused headaches to the employer in later litigation. His
solution: do away with mandatory or regular evaluations and
simply tell employees to assume that they are performing at an
"acceptable" level unless they are specifically told otherwise.

<H2>General Provisions</h2>

<H2>The Ultimate Employee Handbook -- A Workshop</h2>

<H3>Workshop Discussion Thread</h3>

From: Michael P. Maslanka -- Clark, West - Dallas<br>

Subject: general provisions<p>

Last Append: Tue Jan 30 00:13:57 1996<p>

A couple of general ideas.<p>

First, do any of you use a general policy requiring co-operation of the
employee. We see this from time to time in a policy on investigation
into misconduct where the employee is told that he or she must
co-operate in any investigation and failure to do so may lead to
termination. I've seen one handbook where there was a separate section
on this issue and the employee told of the requirement that they
co-operate in all areas including helping the company in determining how
or even whether they should get benefits. Second, in a harassment
policy, some handbooks tell the employee that if they believe thay have
been harassed that they must report the conduct withing 48 hours. Of
course, the employe[r] still looks into any complaints made outside that
period, but the 48 hour deal is helpful in convincing a jury that the
employer is serious about harassment. Third, I think that polices
dealing with drugs, guns etc. need to have some provision in them on how
the contrband will be disposed of. (i.e. given to cops, returned (a gun)
to the employee etc. Any sample policies out there on this?<p>

Subject: general provisions<p>

I don't have any sample policies -- at least I don't think so; I'll shop
around. But I think the idea of a "duty to cooperate" policy is an
excellent one. The law (in California, at least) specifies a duty of
loyalty -- but a duty to cooperate makes all the sense in the world to
me. It could be very helpful in a sexual harassment investigation, for
example, where an employee may be under the mis-impression that he or
she has "the right to remain silent." Of course, in the public sector,
they may! But not in the private sector -- at least as far as I know. So
this sort of explicit mandate could be very effective. Thanks for the
idea.<p>

<H2>Discipline [Policy Language]</h2>

<H2>The Ultimate Employee Handbook -- A Workshop</h2>

<H3>Workshop Discussion Thread</h3>

From: Cloyd Laporte, III -- Counsel Connect - New York<br>

Subject: Discipline<p>

Last Append: Thu Feb  1 21:41:56 1996<p>

A number of the comments in the workshop to date have mentioned
that handbook language dealing with a company's discipline
policies -- what the company will do when an employee engages in
what the company considers misconduct -- is particularly
troublesome.<p> 

In addition to the appropriate dislclaimers about 
<A HREF="http://www.courttv.com/legalhelp/business/workplace/660.html">
at-will employment</a>, <I>what policy language should be in the Ultimate
Employee Handbook regarding misconduct?</i><p>

Neil Bernstein has suggested that the policy should be very
general (Neil?). In the "Pitfalls" thread, Sharon Grodin writes:<p><OL> 

<LI>If it's personal, it should rarely be done in the
workplace;<p>

<LI>Anything done in the workplace presents a greater risk that
it will not be treated as private by the employer;<p> 

<LI>If personal use costs money (as with long-distance calls, use
of copiers, etc.), you should pay for it;<p> 

<LI>If it's potentially offensive to others in the workplace,
keep it out of the workplace;<p> 


<LI>If your use of the employer's communications media is potentially
embarassing or harmful to the employer, don't be surprised if your
employer wants to find out about it and wants you to stop. But then she
suggests that few clients would accept such plain language.</ol><p> 

So, what's the answer? Should an employer just say "Don't Lie, Cheat or
Steal because it may get you fired?"<p>

Subject: Discipline-Why say anything?<p>

Sharon's my partner, so I'm biased: I hadn't seen her language until I
read it on-line, and I like it! But I guess the question I'd pose in
response to the main question is: other than what is required by statute
(that is, the no-harassment policy) -- why say anything? If an employer
intends to be at-will, really intends it, why not say only that? For
infractions like tardiness, the employer isn't going to fire the
employee the first time, so the one-on-one warning suffices to put the
employee on notice (or should), regardless of the handbook, that
<STRONG>that</strong> must be corrected. For more serious infractions,
who needs a handbook? It's a question, really -- and I'd be interested
in the thoughts of others. Why say anything at all?<p>

Subject: Discipline<p>

A handbook can serve one of two relatively inconsistent functions:<p><OL>

<LI>It can be a public relations document to convince employees that
this is a great place to work; or,<p>

<LI>it can be a litigation-support document to provide everyone with
consistent and unquestioned notice of their duties and the consequences
of not living up to them.</ol><p> 

If the handbook is to serve the first purpose, it can provide the
employees with great job security (and get them out of the "at will"
category) by spelling out the only conditions under which they will lose
their jobs. Most of us lawyers, however, think the handbook should be in
the second category. If that is your intention, the handbook should only
list a few of the more important and less self-evident violations and
their consequences (for example, that a thief will be terminated for a
first offense, regardless of the amount involved or whether she stole
from the company or anyone else) and should be careful to state that
these examples are only representative and that anything else the
employer deems to be inappropriate behavior will be punished
accordingly. That kind of a handbook however, often makes the head of
personnel nauseous.<p>

Subject: Termination Policy<p>

In addition to setting forth grounds for dismissal, I think that the
"termination" policy portion of the handbook is an excellent place to
reconfirm the "at-will" nature of the employment relationship. In
addition, I prefer calling the grounds for termination "examples" and
stating specifically: "This list is not exhaustive."<p> 

<hr><p>

Appended by: Maurice Baskin -- Venable, Baetjer - Washington<br>
Date: Thu Feb  1 21:41:56 1996<br>
Subject: Discipline<p>

Indeed, it is a must that any list of dischargeable offenses be
supplemented by the statement that the list is not exhaustive. We favor
a somewhat longer list than just two or three basic offenses, because
being able to identify a specific written policy which the discharged
employee has violated definitely makes it easier to defend the
termination. Although I have already stated elsewhere which category I
am in regarding the "litigation support" vs. "feel good communications"
debate (the first goal, though not the only goal, of the handbook should
be litigation support), the longer list of work rules actually serves
important communications needs as well, since it lets employees know
where they stand.<p>

The other big issue about discipline policies mentioned above is whether
to spell out a progressive discipline system. A lot of employers have
gotten into trouble by detailing such a system of
warnings/suspension/discharge. Even though progressive discipline is
usually best from both a human relations and legal point of view,
supervisors seem to be incapable of getting it consistently right, and
courts have found that minor procedural mistakes somehow override the at
will disclaimers. See, e.g., 13 Emp. At-will Rep. 33 (Dec. 1995),
listing cases from Colorado, New Jersey, New Mexico, Michigan, W. Va., S.
Car. and Pa. in which progessive discipline policies were held to
support plaintiffs' breach of handbook claims. We at Venable have
developed a policy which seems to take care of this problem while
keeping the good things about progressive discipline. The policy spells
out a variety of progressive steps which "may" be used; it does not
establish any rigid step-by-step approach; it makes clear that some
offenses are more serious than others; and most importantly, the policy
reserves to employers the right to skip steps, in their discretion. No
matter what your policies say, however, supervisory training is crucial,
and too little realized, in reducing litigation costs.<p>

QUESTION=In our handbook we have a section on [the] FMLA [Family and
Medical Leave Act]. After the new reg[ulation]s went into effect, we
decided we needed to revise that portion, along with the corresponding
policy. I spoke with the U.S. Dept. of Labor regarding this and was
given the following information, which only creates a problem in the
event of an employee's own serious illness. If an employee is receiving
<STRONG>either NYS disability, workers comp[ensation] or accrued sick
time</strong>, that absence can be counted against the FMLA entitlement.
If an employee is receiving disability or workers compensation
<STRONG>and is supplementing</strong> them with accrued sick time, that
time <STRONG>cannot</strong> count against FMLA entitlement. I spoke
with our labor attorney today regarding this because in speaking with
other organizations, I have not found any that are dealing with this in
their policy. He said they have been advising employers that if
employees are receiving DBL [disability] or WC [worker's compensation]
and supplementing with sick time, they <STRONG>can</strong> count that
as FMLA leave. He is going to talk to the person I have talked with at
the Labor Dept. But I am wondering what the understanding is here, and
<STRONG>how</strong> you would address this in a handbook. We allow
employees to accumulate up to 120 hours of sick time. How could we turn
around and tell them you can't use this for your own long term illness?
I'm lost...<p>

Subject: Counting FMLA Leave<p>

I must respectfully disagree with the attorney who advised that an
employer "can" count this as FMLA leave. Given the DOL's position on
this, there are only two options: (i) deny employees the right to
supplement WC [Worker's Compensation] or Disability with accrued sick
leave, in which case the leave "can" be counted as FMLA or (ii) allow
employees to use accrued sick leave as a supplement and do not not count
the leave as FMLA until the sick leave is exhausted. The third
"option" -- ignoring the DOL position until the dust settles on this
issue -- is at your own risk.<p>

Subject: Romance Policy<p>

The "romance in the workplace" policy that I added to the library was
designed to: (i) discourage intra-office relationships that could
potentially lead to sexual harassment and (ii) cope with the reality
that some consensual relationships are inevitable.<p> 

A policy to deal with the problem of "sleeping with the enemy" would
have to be designed with other purposes in mind.<p>

Subject: Romance with Competitor<p>

A general business conduct policy should cover any improper behavior
that might arise based on this situation, as well as any other
situation. The policy should not try to penalize the fact of the
relationship, but, rather, whether the relationship leads to anything
improper. And the first step of the policy would be disclosure and
review, rather than blanket prohibition.<p>

A policy in this area might cover the following points: No disclosure of
confidential information. No acceptance of payments, loans,
entertainment, gifts, over nominal amount, from anyone seeking to do
business with company. Disclosure if employee or family member has any
interest or employment relationship in competitor. No self-dealing
(i.e., doing business with the company).<p>

The cases that find employers liable for invasions of privacy
emphasize that the employer interfered with something on which
the employee had an expectation of privacy. That expectation can
be removed by statement in a handbook that the employer has the
right to inspect lockers, desks, restrooms, cars and other areas
on the premises and to monitor all conversations where deemed
necessary or appropriate. Granted, such language does not add to
the attractiveness of the workplace, but it does provide legal
protection. Does anyone include such statements in the handbooks
they draft?<p>

Subject: Privacy<p>

Privacy in the locker room and in the parking lot is the same
basic issue as privacy on the telephone and on email. I guess the
manual could have a paragraph under the heading "Company
Furnished Facilities" that states that employees when using
facilities provided by the Company should be aware that the
Company reserves the right to inspect the facilities and review
their use by employees. An added benefit of such a policy is that
it supports the employer in keeping an eye on the place to
prevent workplace harassment -- a bit like patrolling the halls
in the high school.<p>

The policy should also note that email, phonemail, or other
computer files created on the job are the property of the
employer, and the employee should have no expectation of privacy
for such files.<p>

A small question for the last day: does anyone have no-smoking
policies in their handbooks? I don't mean smoking in the
workplace (which is illegal in California unless it's a bar --
and that will be illegal in a year or so), but requiring that
employees be non-smokers? Presumably the rationale would be
better attendance and lower health insurance premiums, but I'm
curious to know whether these are being used anywhere in the
country.<p>

On the one hand, the City of North Miami, Florida, has a policy
that all job applicants must sign an affidavit stating that they
have not used tobacco products for one year before seeking a job
with the City. The U.S. Supreme Court recently refused to hear
the appeal of the rejected applicant. Thus, the decision of the
highest court in Florida was left intact.<p> 

On the other hand, such a policy would be illegal in New York
because of its "legal activities" law.<p>

There have been several threads in the ADA forum on this issue.
Some argue an employer cannot have such a policy because it is
facially discriminatory against nicotine addicts. Moreover, the
stated purpose in your hypo[thetical question], to bring health
insurance premiums down, might strike some as similar to policies
that discriminatorily bar individuals with AIDS from health
coverage. Some counter-considerations: is nicotine addiction
really a mental or physical impairment? If so, how does it
substantially limit a major life activity? We all know plenty of
people hooked on the stink weed whose only limitation in life
activities is on where they eat in the restaurant. Also, even if
nicotine addiction is a disability, couldn't the employer allow
the employee reasonable accommodation in the form of time to
"rehabilitate," as if it were alcoholism? Lots of questions, and
I'm sorry that there appear to be few answers.<p>

Editor's note: This policy was approved by BASF's board of
directors on Nov. 22, 1995 and will be distributed to San
Francisco legal employers.<p>

<H3></h3>

INTRODUCTION<p>

This Model Policy for Domestic Partner Health Benefits was
drafted to encourage Bar Association of San Francisco ("BASF" or
"the Association") member law firms and corporate law departments
to offer same-sex domestic partner health benefits to their
employees and to assist Association members and other employers
who are considering offering such benefits.[n.1] BASF believes that
making health benefits available to same-sex domestic partners is
a crucial component of creating and maintaining a work
environment that is free from sexual orientation discrimination
and bias. Without such benefits, employees with same-sex domestic
partners are deprived of a valuable form of compensation that is
routinely offered to married employees, and therefore do not
receive equal pay for their work. The Association considers the
elimination of sexual orientation discrimination to be a matter
of great importance and urges all of its members to implement
domestic partner health benefits as a means of furthering that
goal. In BASF's 1991 Creating an Environment Conducive to
Diversity: A Guide for Legal Employers on Eliminating Sexual
Orientation Discrimination, the Association formally recommended
that its members offer health benefits to the domestic partners
of lesbian and gay employees, to the extent possible under
federal tax law, on the same terms that they are made available
to the spouses of married employees.<p>

Over the last few years, a number of BASF member firms (
including several of San Francisco's oldest firms ( have
successfully negotiated with insurers and health maintenance
organizations ("HMOs") to provide domestic partner health
coverage.[n.2] As more and more employers in the legal profession and
elsewhere have expressed interest in providing domestic partner
benefits, insurers and HMOs have become increasingly willing to
offer domestic partner health coverage. Accordingly, employers
who wish to offer such benefits are often able to do so through
their existing insurers and HMOs. Moreover, the experience of
employers who have been offering such benefits for a number of
years demonstrates that the costs for employees with domestic
partners do not exceed those for employees with spouses.[n.3] The BASF
Model Policy is comprised of an Overview of Issues Relating to
Domestic Partner Health Benefits, which addresses the various
issues that must be considered in implementing domestic partner
health benefits, and Model Documents (a summary of benefits,
statement of eligibility, and notice of termination) that are
typically required by insurers that provide domestic partner
health coverage. The Model Documents can be modified by
individual employers to meet their own particular needs as well
as the requirements of their insurers and/or HMOs. The Model
Policy also contains lists of BASF members who are currently
providing domestic partner health benefits and of insurers and
HMOs that have provided such benefits.<p>

Although virtually all of the provisions in the Model Documents
have been implemented in some form in existing policies, because
the Model Policy was designed with the goal of providing health
benefits to the domestic partners of gay and lesbian employees
that are, wherever possible, the equivalent of, and offered on
the same terms as, the benefits offered to the spouses of married
employees, the Model Documents include some provisions that may
not yet have been approved by insurers and HMOs and omits others
that are frequently required. Accordingly, employers seeking to
implement the Model Policy will likely have to negotiate with
their insurers and/or HMOs to gain approval of some of its
provisions. To assist employers in such negotiations, the Model
Policy discusses the rationale of its major provisions and also
includes suggested alternatives should any insurer be unwilling
to accept specific provisions.<p>

While these documents focus exclusively on health benefits, there
are a number of other benefits that employers frequently provide
to married employees that can easily be extended to employees
with domestic partners in order to ensure equality and fairness.
For example, employers can and should include domestic partners
when offering bereavement leave or sick-care leave. For more
information on eliminating sexual orientation in the workplace,
please consult Creating an Environment Conducive to Diversity: A
Guide for Legal Employers on Eliminating Sexual Orientation
Discrimination, which is available from BASF's offices.<p>

The BASF Model Domestic Partner Health Benefits Policy is not
intended to be legal advice; employers should consult with their
benefits, employment, and/or tax advisors to tailor model policy
terms to their individual circumstances.<p>

OVERVIEW OF ISSUES RELATING TO DOMESTIC PARTNER HEALTH
BENEFITS<p>

Employers considering offering domestic partner health benefits
to their employees will have to make decisions concerning
domestic partners' eligibility for benefits, the manner in which
domestic partners will be required to demonstrate their
eligibility, and the scope of coverage to be provided to domestic
partners.[n.4] The major issues for decision are discussed below.
Other issues are discussed in annotations to the Model
Documents.DEFINING ELIGIBLE DOMESTIC PARTNER RELATIONSHIPS. In
contrast to marriage, which is defined by law, society has not
yet adopted a common definition of domestic partner
relationships.[n.5] Thus, the first step that employers must take in
implementing domestic partner health benefits is to establish the
criteria that domestic partners must satisfy in order to be
eligible for benefits. While some employers have attempted to
define eligible relationships in part by attempting to describe
the emotional bond or commitment shared by a couple, the
Association believes that it would be as difficult to describe
those bonds in a manner that would encompass all domestic partner
relationships as it would be to describe the bonds among all
married couples. Instead, BASF's Model Documents require that the
employee and partner be each other's "sole domestic partner" and
expressly exclude coverage for roommates, relatives, and others
who are not in domestic partner relationships.<p>

Employers who offer domestic partner health benefits typically
have defined eligible relationships by specifying some
combination of emotional and financial ties that must exist among
the partners and/or by requiring that the partners register their
domestic partnership with the City and County of San Francisco.
The Association's Model Documents follow this approach, by
requiring that the employee and domestic partner be each other's
sole domestic partner and that they either register their
partnership with the City and County of San Francisco or possess
at least three of seven specified indicia of emotional and
financial interdependence that are common among persons in
committed relationships (e.g. joint lease, mortgage or deed;
joint ownership of a vehicle; joint checking account or credit
account; and designation of the domestic partner as a beneficiary
of the employee's life insurance, retirement benefits, or will).
The Model Policy includes an alternative to domestic partner
registration to establish eligibility because of concerns in the
lesbian and gay community that the registration offered by the
City and County of San Francisco is an inadequate substitute for
legal marriage and does not offer sufficient benefits for the
obligations that it imposes. For example, San Francisco's
Declaration of Domestic Partnership obligates the partners to pay
third parties for the costs of each other's living expenses, but
affords no corresponding tax benefits or inheritance rights. In
light of these concerns, BASF believes it is appropriate to make
registration sufficient to establish eligibility but also to
provide an alternative to registration.<p>

Similarly, although many employers and insurers have required
domestic partners to live together or to wait a specified period
before becoming eligible for benefits, the Model Documents do not
impose such requirements, because they typically are not required
of married couples. BASF recognizes that domestic partners, like
married couples, may live separately due to work or other
obligations without terminating their relationship. In addition,
by requiring domestic partners either to register with the City
and County of San Francisco or possess at least three indicia of
emotional and financial interdependence, the Model Documents
ensure that domestic partners have established significant
objective manifestations of their relationships before they are
eligible for benefits. To the extent that employers and insurers
have imposed such requirements out of concern that domestic
partner benefits not be abused by employees seeking coverage for
persons who are not truly their domestic partners, the experience
of employers who have offered domestic partner benefits
demonstrates that such concerns are unfounded.[n.6] Employers who are
concerned about potential abuse of domestic partner benefits
should consider that employees who enroll a same-sex domestic
partner in their employers' health plans must be prepared to
identify themselves as gay men or lesbians to at least some of
their fellow employees, a step that many employees are reluctant
to take. Moreover, because the IRS does not recognize domestic
partners to be qualified dependents, employees will have to pay
income taxes on the value of the benefits their domestic partners
receive and, therefore, will have financial disincentives from
abusing domestic partner benefits. Where a provision requiring
domestic partners to live together is nonetheless included in a
policy, BASF recommends that the policy permit employees to
obtain coverage for their domestic partners if one of the
partners is temporarily living away from the joint residence but
intends to return on a permanent basis.<p>

DEMONSTRATING ELIGIBILITY.<p>

While most employers have extended health benefits to employees'
spouses solely on the basis of the employees' identification of
their spouses, most insurers that provide domestic partner health
coverage have been unwilling to accept a comparable
representation from employees in domestic partner relationships
and have instead required employees seeking such benefits to
submit some form of documentation of their eligibility. Most
often, the required documentation is a declaration of eligibility
signed under penalty of perjury, which some insurers require to
be notarized. BASF believes that married employees and lesbian
and gay employees with domestic partners should be treated
equally with respect to how they are required to demonstrate
their eligibility for benefits. Thus, where an insurer insists
upon written documentation of eligibility or where an employer
prefers to obtain such documentation, BASF recommends that
documentation be required from married couples as well as
domestic partners.[n.7] Requiring the same documentation from married
couples and domestic partners ensures that gay and lesbian
employees are not singled out as unreliable or untrustworthy in
representing to their employers that they have satisfied the
established criteria for eligibility for benefits coverage. To
ensure that this is not an onerous burden, the document
establishing eligibility could be incorporated into the document
in which employees identify the spouse or domestic partner to be
enrolled in the plan. In addition, to minimize inconvenience,
where married employees have enrolled their spouses in the
benefits plan before implementation of the domestic partner
policy, those employees could be exempted from the requirement of
submitting documentation of their spouses' eligibility until the
next open enrollment period, and could then submit their
documentation of eligibility at the same time they submit any
other required enrollment documents. BASF also recommends that
employers consider negotiating with their insurers to omit
notarization of the statement of eligibility, as this requirement
will cause needless expense and inconvenience to all employees
who seek to enroll a spouse or domestic partner in a benefits
plan.<p>

SCOPE OF COVERAGE.<p>  

BASF recommends that domestic partners be offered the same
benefits that are offered to employees' spouses and on the same
terms. For example, if an employer pays 100% of the cost of
benefits for employees' spouses, it should also pay 100% of the
cost of benefits for employees' domestic partners. Similarly,
although a domestic partner does not have a right to COBRA
coverage under existing law, employers should extend the
equivalent coverage to employees' domestic partners that is
offered to employees' spouses.<p>

MODEL DOCUMENTS<p>

SUMMARY OF HEALTH BENEFITS FOR DOMESTIC PARTNERS<p>

[Name of Employer] now offers its employees the opportunity to
obtain domestic partner health benefits. Coverage is available
for couples in same-sex domestic partner relationships.[n.8] Coverage
does not extend to roommates, siblings, parents, or persons
related in a way that would prohibit marriage in California.
Complete details are available in the [refer to name of plan
documents].<p>

ELIGIBILITY:<p> 

Coverage is available for couples in same-sex domestic partner
relationships; it is not available to roommates, siblings,
parents, or persons related in a way that would prohibit marriage
in California. To be eligible for domestic partner health
benefits, the employee and domestic partner must be:[n.9]<p><UL>

<LI>The sole domestic partner of each other;
<LI>At least 18 years of age; and
<LI>Not legally married.<p></ul> 

In addition to the criteria set forth above,
the employee and domestic partner must either:<p><OL>

<LI>Have obtained a Domestic Partnership Certificate from the
City and County of San Francisco or from any other city, county,
or state offering the ability to register a domestic partnership,
and have not obtained a dissolution of the domestic
partnership[n.10]; or,
<LI>Have at least three of the following:[n.11]<p></ol><UL>

<LI>joint lease, mortgage, or deed;
<LI>joint ownership of vehicle;
<LI>joint ownership of checking account or credit account;
<LI>designation of the domestic partner as a beneficiary for the
employee's life insurance or retirement benefits;
<LI>designation of the domestic partner as a beneficiary of the employee's will;
<LI>designation of the domestic partner as holding power of
attorney for health care; or
<LI>shared household expenses.<p></ul>

ENROLLMENT OF DOMESTIC PARTNER:<p> 

An employee can enroll a domestic partner within the same time
periods as apply to the enrollment of spouses.[n.12] At the time the
employee seeks to enroll a domestic partner, the employee must
complete a Statement of Marriage or Domestic Partnership.<p>

BENEFITS COVERAGE FOR DOMESTIC PARTNERS:<p> 

The benefits provided to domestic partners are the same benefits
as provided to spouses of married employees.<p>

BENEFITS COVERAGE FOR CHILDREN OF DOMESTIC PARTNERS:<p> 

Children of domestic partners are eligible for benefits under the
same conditions as the children of employees' spouses.<p>

COVERAGE CONTINUATION:<p>

Domestic partners and their enrolled dependents will receive the
same or the equivalent benefits as spouses and their enrolled
dependents receive for group continuation of health coverage
through COBRA and/or individual conversion.[n.13]<p>

TERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY:<p>

Upon termination of the domestic partner relationship, or if the
domestic partner no longer meets the criteria for eligibility,
the employee must notify the plan administrator within 31 days,
by submitting a Notice of Termination of Eligibility.[n.14]<p>

TAX CONSEQUENCES OF ENROLLMENT:<p>

Because the IRS does not recognize domestic partners to be
qualified dependents, employees will have to pay income taxes on
the value of the benefits their domestic partners receive, unless
a domestic partner meets the eligibility criteria for tax
dependent status under the Internal Revenue Code.[n.15] Employees who
seek to enroll their domestic partners in the benefits plan
should consult a tax advisor concerning the tax consequences of
obtaining such benefits.<p>

CONFIDENTIALITY:<p>

Enrollment forms and Statements of Marriage or Domestic
Partnership will be kept confidential, and will be shared with
human resources, accounting, and payroll department employees
only for the purpose of implementing and administering the
benefits, and as required or permitted by law.<p>

1 The Model Policy was drafted by the Bar Association's Committee
on Sexual Orientation issues, Ruth N. Borenstein and Michael J.
Sears, co-chairs. It was approved by the Association's Board of
Directors on November 22, 1995.<p>

2 BASF member firms offering domestic partner health benefits
include McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen, Morrison & Foerster,
Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, and Pillsbury Madison & Sutro. A
list of BASF firms that offer domestic partner health benefits is
included in the Model Policy. The Association thanks these firms
for their pioneering efforts in affording health benefits to
domestic partners.<p>

3 "Generally speaking, and contrary to warnings and predictions
by insurers and others, extending coverage to domestic partners
has not resulted in statistically significant differences in cost
. . when adding domestic partners than when adding spouses."

Partner of Gay and Lesbian Employees at Lotus Development
Corporation (Simmons College Graduate School of Management,

4 Because this Model Policy was drafted as part of an effort to
eradicate discrimination and bias against lesbians and gay men,
it addresses coverage for same-sex domestic partners only.
Employers who choose to offer benefits to opposite-sex as well as
same-sex domestic partners could modify the Model Documents to
apply to all domestic partners.<p>

5 Although there may not yet be a common definition of domestic partners,
recognition of domestic partner relationships is well-established in the lesbian
and gay community and increasingly widely recognized in society at large. One
dictionary defines domestic partner as a "person with whom one cohabits in a
sexual relationship." American Heritage Dictionary (3d ed.). Another defines it
as "either member of an unmarried, cohabitting and especially homosexual couple
that seeks benefits usually available only to spouses." Random House Unabridged
Dictionary (2d ed.).<p>

6 Dennis Hostetler & Joan E. Pines, Domestic Partnership Benefits: Dispelling
the Myth, 15 Rev. Pub. Personnel Admin. 41 (Winter 1995); E. Murphy,
Understanding the Domestic Partner Dilemma: Perspectives of Employer and
Insurer, (City of West Hollywood, 1992); Bureau of Nat'l. Aff., Recognizing
Non-Traditional Families, Special Report #38 (1991).<p>

7 As examples of employers with this type of provision, Orrick, Herrington &
Sutcliffe requires employees with spouses as well as those with domestic
partners to submit declarations of eligibility, and Cooley Godward Castro
Huddleson & Tatum requires that employees who seek to enroll spouses or domestic
partners possess at least three specified documents, such as a joint lease or
durable power of attorney, in order to be eligible for benefits.<p>

8 BASF believes that the term "domestic partnership" is commonly understood, at
least in the gay and lesbian community, to denote a committed relationship
between two people. As noted in footnote 5, supra, it has been defined by at
least two modern dictionaries. The Association has not attempted to define
domestic partner relationships with reference to the emotional bonds and
commitments shared by a couple because it believes that it would be as difficult
to describe those bonds in a manner that would encompass all domestic partner
relationships as it would be to define the bonds among all married couples.
Nevertheless, some employers have included in their eligibility requirements
that the partners have "an intimate, committed relationship of mutual caring" or
that they "have a committed relationship" and consider themselves "life
partners." Because employers have used a variety of different methods to define
eligible domestic partner relationships, the Association has appended to this
Model Policy excerpts from the actual policies of three BASF member firms.<p>

9 Some insurers and HMOs require that domestic partners live together in order
to obtain benefits. These Model Documents do not include such a requirement
because it typically is not required of married couples. BASF recognizes that
domestic partners, like married couples, may live separately due to work or
other obligations without terminating their relationship. Any requirement that
domestic partners live together should permit them to obtain benefits if one of
the partners is temporarily living away from the joint residence but intends to
return on a permanent basis. Insurers may also require that the domestic
partners be mentally competent. The BASF Model Documents do not include a
competency requirement because no comparable requirement is imposed on married
employees when they enroll their spouses. If an insurer insists upon a
competency requirement, BASF recommends that the employer negotiate a provision
requiring that the domestic partners were competent at the beginning of the
domestic partner relationship, just as a married employee is typically able to
obtain benefits for a spouse who was competent on the date of their wedding,
regardless of any subsequent incompetency.<p>

10 While the Model Documents make registration of a domestic partner
relationship sufficient to establish eligibility for benefits, they do
not require registration but instead permit eligibility to be
established through satisfying three or more indicia of emotional and
financial interdependence. There has been some concern in the gay and
lesbian community that the registration offered by the City and County
of San Francisco is an inadequate substitute for legal marriage and does
not offer sufficient benefits for the obligations that it imposes. For
example, San Francisco's Declaration of Domestic Partnership obligates
the partners to pay third parties for the costs of each other's living
expenses, including medical expenses not covered by insurance where one
of the partners obtains health insurance through a domestic partner
benefits policy, but affords no corresponding tax benefits or
inheritance rights. In light of these concerns, the Association believes
it is appropriate to offer an alternative to registration. For similar
reasons, although required by some insurers, the Model Policy does not
require employees to represent that they are responsible for their
domestic partners basic necessities or welfare. BASF does not believe
that employees should be required to sign a document that could obligate
them to third parties for their partners' expenses where the only
benefit associated with that obligation is enrollment in the employers'
health plan. Although health coverage is certainly a valuable and
significant benefit, it is dwarfed by assuming a burden to third parties
for living expenses and medical expenses incurred by the employee's
partner where the employee does not also receive inheritance, tax, and
other benefits. To the extent that insurers view a requirement that
domestic partners be responsible for each other's expenses to be an
indication of serious commitment between the partners, BASF believes
that, because of the problems with that requirement, satisfying at least
three of the seven listed indicia of emotional and financial
interdependence is an appropriate surrogate.<p>

11 Some policies that include similar indicia of financial and emotional
interdependence require not only that the employees submit statements of
eligibility but also that they provide proof that they satisfy the
criteria (e.g. a copy of a lease). BASF does not recommend that
employers require such documentation, as that requirement would likely
prove to be cumbersome not only for the employees who have to provide
the documentation but also for the employers who would have to process
the documents that were submitted.<p>

12 The references in the Model Policy to provisions that are applicable
to spouses should be replaced in an employer's plan documents with
language identifying the specific plan provisions that will apply to
both spouses and domestic partners. Most policies permit a spouse to be
enrolled either during an open enrollment period or within a specified
time after the employee marries. The Association recommends that
domestic partners be eligible for enrollment during open enrollment
periods, for a specified time period after domestic partner coverage is
first made available, and for a specified time period after the partners
first satisfy the criteria for eligibility set forth in the plan
documents.<p>

13 COBRA and individual conversion are typically made available to
employees' spouses at the termination of the employment relationship or
upon divorce. For domestic partner relationships, such benefits should
be made available at the termination of employment or upon dissolution
of the domestic partnership, which should be defined as the date on
which the partnership no longer satisfies the criteria for eligibility
set forth in the plan documents.<p>

14 Some insurers require employers to impose a waiting period after
termination of a domestic partner relationship before the employee is
permitted to enroll a new domestic partner. BASF recommends that
employers who include such a requirement in their plans impose a
comparable waiting period on married employees who seek to enroll a new
spouse.<p>

15 For plans that include flexible benefits, the plan documents should
note that although married employees can use pre-tax dollars to purchase
coverage for their spouses in the flexible benefits portion of the plan,
employees with domestic partners must use after-tax dollars to purchase
the same coverage.<p>

16 Most employers have extended coverage for health benefits to their
employees' spouses solely on the basis of the employees' identification
of their spouses. Most insurers that offer domestic partner health
benefits have been unwilling to accept a comparable representation from
employees seeking benefits for their domestic partners, and have instead
required them to submit documentation of eligibility. Where an insurer
insists upon written documentation of eligibility from domestic
partners, or an employer prefers such documentation, BASF recommends
that documentation be obtained from married employees as well as
employees with domestic partners, so that employers do not single out
gay and lesbian employees as untrustworthy in representing to the
employer their eligibility for benefits. This document could be modified
so that it serves not only to establish eligibility but also to enroll
the spouse or domestic partner in the relevant benefit plan. In
addition, where married employees have enrolled their spouses in the
benefits plan before implementation of the domestic partner benefits
policy, they could be exempted from the requirement of submitting
documentation of eligibility until the next open enrollment period.
Should the employer prefer and the insurer agree, there would be no need
for documentation of eligibility from either married employees or
employees with domestic partners.<p>

17 If changes were made to the list of eligibility criteria that appears
in the Summary of Health Benefits for Domestic Partners, comparable
changes should be made in this Statement of Marriage or Domestic
Partnership.<p>

18 Some insurers may require that statements of eligibility for domestic
partner benefits be notarized and signed under penalty of perjury. BASF
believes that a notarization requirement imposes needless expense and
inconvenience on employees. However, where an insurer insists on
notarization, the same requirements should be imposed on married
employees who enroll their spouses, in order to ensure that employers do
not single out gay and lesbian employees for disfavored treatment.<p>

<H4>Author caveat: This policy is a guideline only, as no one policy
that can fit all, or even most, employers. Each employer's e-mail
policy will be shaped by such individual factors as Company culture, who
uses the e-mail system, the capabilities of the e-mail software
program, including encryption, whether employees are permitted to link
their home computers to the employer's workplace network, and Company
policies with regard to analogous hard-paper storage. E-mail policies
can be drafted to be more restrictive or more protective of employee
privacy rights. Any specific policy should be drafted with the
assistance of counsel to make sure legal requirements are met.</h4><p>

<hr><p>

<H3>Sample E-Mail Policy</h3><p>

This policy describes XYZ Corporation's guidelines with regard to access
to and disclosure of electronic mail messages sent or received by XYZ
employees with use of the XYZ e-mail system.<p>

XYZ respects the individual privacy of its employees. However, employee
privacy does not extend to the employee's work-related conduct or to the
use of Company-provided equipment or supplies. You should be aware that
the following guidelines may affect your privacy in the workplace.<p>

<H4>Management's Right to Access Information.</h4><p>

The electronic mail system has been installed by XYZ to facilitate
business communications. Although each employee has an individual
password to access this system, it belongs to the Company and the
contents of e-mail communications are accessible at all times by XYZ
management for any business purpose. These systems may be subject to
periodic unannounced inspections, and should be treated like other
shared filing systems. All system
<A HREF="http://www.courttv.com/seminars/handbook/crypto.html"> 
passwords and encryption keys</a> must be available to Company
management, and you may not use passwords that are unknown to your
supervisor or install encryption programs without turning over
encryption keys to your supervisor.<p>

All e-mail messages are Company records. The contents of e-mail,
properly obtained for legitimate business purposes, may be disclosed
within the Company without your permission. Therefore, you should not
assume that messages are confidential. Back-up copies of e-mail may be
maintained and referenced for business and legal reasons.<p>

<H4>Personal Use of E-Mail.</h4>

Because XYZ provides the electronic mail system to assist you in the
performance of your job, you should use it for official Company
business. Incidental and occasional personal use of e-mail is
permitted by XYZ, but these messages will be treated the same as other
messages. XYZ reserves the right to access and disclose as necessary all
messages sent over its e-mail system, without regard to content.<p>

Since your personal messages can be accessed by XYZ management without
prior notice, you should not use e-mail to transmit any messages you
would not want read by a third party. For example, you should not use
the XYZ e-mail for gossip, including personal information about yourself
or others, for forwarding messages under circumstances likely to
embarrass the sender, or for emotional responses to business
correspondence or work situations. In any event, you should not use
these systems for such purposes as soliciting or proselytizing for
commercial ventures, religious or personal causes or outside
organizations or other similar, non-job-related solicitations. If XYZ
discovers that you are misusing the e-mail system, you will be subject
to disciplinary action up to and including termination.<p>

<H4>Forbidden Content of E-Mail Communications.</h4>

You may not use XYZ's e-mail system in any way that may be seen as
insulting, disruptive, or offensive by other persons, or harmful to
morale. Examples of forbidden transmissions include sexually-explicit
messages, cartoons, or jokes; unwelcome propositions or love letters;
ethnic or racial slurs; or any other message that can be construed to be
harassment or disparagement of others based on their sex, race, sexual
orientation, age, national origin, or religious or political beliefs.<p>

Use of the Company-provided e-mail system in violation of this guideline
will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.<p>

<H4>Password and Encryption Key Security and Integrity.</h4>

Employees are prohibited from the unauthorized use of the passwords and
encryption keys of other employees to gain access to the other
employee's e-mail messages.<p>

<H2>A Cryptography Primer (c)1995 Charles R. Merrill{n.1}</h2>  

[Draft of October 3, 1995. An edited version of this article was
published in January 1996 by The Computer Law Association, Joseph
F. Ruh, Jr., Editor, <I>The Internet and Business: A Lawyer's Guide
to the Emerging Legal Issues</i> , IBSN 1-885169-05-1] <p>

Cryptography is the "art and science of keeping messages
secure."{n.2} Until recently this term has been familiar only to
intelligence professionals, readers of spy novels, and crossword
puzzle buffs. The objectives of this section are to explain why
non-technical business lawyers should make the effort to learn
something about cryptography{n.3}, and to introduce some
terminology and simple concepts as a groundwork for understanding
how cryptography works.<p>

Business lawyers must first realize that the message security
which is of concern to them is a far broader concept than mere
privacy, and demands the reliable delivery of a number of
different security services{n.4}:<p><UL> 

<LI>Confidentiality. When Alice (nickname for the sender) sends a
message to Bob (nickname for the recipient), both Alice and Bob
may want the contents of the message to be kept secret from Eve
(nickname for a hypothetical eavesdropper of unknown identity).
The security service known as confidentiality strives to ensure
that Alice and Bob have the EXCLUSIVE KNOWLEDGE of the contents
of the message.<p>

<LI>Authentication. When Bob receives a message which purports to
be sent by Alice, Bob wants to ensure that the message is
actually coming from Alice, and not from Imp (nickname for a
hypothetical imposter of unknown identity). If Alice is in fact
the sender of the message Bob is receiving, she wants to convince
Bob that she rather than Imp is the sender. The security service
known as authentication answers the question, "WHO sent the
message?"<p>

<LI>Message Integrity. When Alice sends a message to Bob, both
Alice and Bob want to ensure that the message has not been
modified between the time of sending by Alice and the time of
receipt by Bob, neither by innocent computer glitch nor by Imp's
malicious tampering. The security service known as message
integrity answers the question, "WHAT message was sent?"<p>

<LI>Non-Repudiation. When Alice sends a message to Bob and Bob
acknowledges receipt of that message, they are potentially
adverse to the other. Each will have the incentive to block the
other party from a future denial of that party's own actions. Bob
wants to ensure non-repudiation of origin, so that Alice cannot
later deny the message was sent. Alice wants to ensure
non-repudiation of delivery, so that Bob cannot later deny the
message was received. The security service known as
non-repudiation answers the question, "Who is ESTOPPED from
denying origin or receipt of a message?"<p>

<LI>Time-Date Stamping. In the future, Alice and Bob also need to
prove to third parties or to each other, "WHEN was Alice's
message was created by Alice, sent by Alice, or received by
Bob?"<p></ul>

Notice that these security services have been defined without any
reference to computers, electronics, or communications on the
Internet. Although the vocabulary may seem new, the concepts
express principles which are intuitively familiar to business
lawyers who have thus far operated in a commercial world based on
paper. The difference is that the familiar system of tangible
messages on paper with pen-and-ink signatures reviewed by humans,
is replaced by intangible streams of electronic bits (binary
digits, either zero or one) seen only by machines.<p>

<H4>Paperless Commerce is a Double-Edged Sword</h4>

The transition from paper-based to paperless commerce on the
Internet and elsewhere on the infobahn is a double-edged sword.
The good news is the efficiency, speed, flexibility, cost savings
and accessibility of electronic communication and commerce. The
dark side is that online communication and commerce on the
Internet are seriously and notoriously insecure.<p>

When using privately-owned communication service providers known
as VANs (value-added networks), attorneys have come to expect
about the same level of security for e-mail as currently offered
for voice and fax services travelling over land lines. In
contrast, the Internet (which is owned by nobody) is based on
TCP/IP (transfer control protocol/internet protocol) routing of
information packets through unpredictable paths through
interconnected networks linking millions of computers. The
Internet, originally intended as a failsafe communication net in
time of nuclear disaster, was designed more with ease of
networked communication in mind than messaging security.<p>

Even with sophisticated network security precautions such as
firewalls (specialized gateway computers to insulate the inside
network from the outside world), wily hackers outside the
firewall continue to demonstrate their ability to sniff for
network weaknesses, insert password grabbers and trojan horses,
spoof (impersonate) both identity and e-mail addresses, and
subvert system routers to select less-secure paths for
interesting message traffic. Although reports of security
break-ins have increased in frequency during the past year, this
is thought to be but the tip of the iceberg, because of the
reluctance of industry and government to publicize incidents
where they have been careless victims of a "crime of shame."<p>

<H4>Raising Security Expectations</h4>

For an attorney entrusted with ethical responsibilities to
preserve client confidences, what use is the speed and
flexibility of electronic mail, if there is no reasonable
assurance of confidentiality? Who would risk more than trivial
amounts of value to electronic commerce, if an unknown hacker two
continents and six time zones away can, with impenetrable
stealth, impersonate a contracting party or a payee?<p>

Even with the consumer's liability limited to $50 for
unauthorized use of her credit card, how long will consumers
entrust credit card, debit card and PIN numbers to an environment
where theft of this information is probable? How long will
merchants (and their prices) tolerate accelerating credit/debit
card fraud, which already costs society billions?<p>

No matter how sexy the siren of paperless electronic appears at
first glance, it will not succeed unless the security of online
open systems is engineered to at least equal the level of
security offered by traditional paper-based systems. In fact,
upon exposure to knowledge of some recent technological advances,
it becomes apparent that the transition to paperless commerce
actually offers an opportunity to raise our level of security
expectations far beyond what we have come to expect in the paper-
based world. How is this possible?<p> 

<H4>Public Key Cryptography As a Solution</h4>

The solution is a system of public key cryptography (sometimes
called asymmetric cryptography), or a public key cryptosystem. We
can understand the public key cryptosystem system best by first
understanding the more familiar system of single key cryptography
(sometimes called symmetric or conventional cryptography.<p>

<H4>Conventional, Single Key Crypto is Not Enough</h4>

An example of a single key cryptosystem is a password on a word
processing document, or a PIN number on an ATM account. With
single key cryptography, the same key (a stream of bits of a
specified key length randomly created by a computer) is used to
encrypt a message from plaintext (which can be read by anyone)
into ciphertext (which can be read only by those possessing the
key), and to decrypt the ciphertext back into plaintext again.<p>

No matter how secure an encryption algorithm (a process of
programmed steps and conversions) it uses, the single key
cryptosystem has two inherent security weaknesses. First, the
sender and the recipient of the message need to share knowledge
of the same secret key, which means that each is required to
trust the other not to compromise knowledge which is exclusively
known by the two of them. Second, the sender and recipient have a
key distribution problem. It is not possible to securely
communicate the knowledge of a secret key to both parties who
need it, without going offband (using a different channel). This
is not a difficult problem for frequent correspondents or
bilateral trading partners who have ample opportunity to exchange
secret keys, often over a single closed system secure from the
outside world. On the other hand, single key cryptography is
awkward at best on the Internet, where the very first
communication between strangers needs to be secure, the
communication is on an open and hostile system, and the system
has a many-to-many topology (structure of the network).<p>

<H4>The Shared Key Risk and The Key Distribution Problem</h4>

A public-key cryptosystem allows robust security on the Internet
because it offers a solution to both the shared key risk and the
key distribution problem. Rather than a single key, a public-key
cryptosystem uses a pair of keys which are mathematically linked
to each other, so that one key is used for encryption and the
other linked key is used for decryption. Each user possesses a
key pair, one of which (the private key) is kept secret and is
never transmitted, and the other (the public key) is widely
publicized. It is computationally unfeasible (see discussion
below regarding the export of encryption software) to derive the
secret key merely from knowledge of the public key.<p>

<H4>Confidentiality, Digital Signatures, and Hash</H4>

If Alice the sender wants to encrypt a message for
confidentiality, Alice's encryption software will apply the
recipient's public key (of Bob). When Bob the recipient wants to
decrypt the message, Bob will use the same encryption software to
apply the recipient's private key (i.e., Bob's own private key).
The security service of confidentiality (exclusive knowledge) is
achieved.<p>

By reversing the process{n.5}, it is possible to affix a digital
signature to a message. If Alice the sender wants to digitally
sign a message, Alice applies her sender's private key. When Bob
the recipient wants to authenticate the origin of the message
(i.e., from Alice), Bob applies the sender's public key (Alice's
public key). This accomplishes the two security services of
authentication (WHO sent the message) and non-repudiation (who is
ESTOPPED from denying the message).<p>

In addition, when in digital signature mode, the security service
of message integrity is simultaneously accomplished, so that it
is certain that Alice's message has not been altered since it was
digitally signed by Alice. Every character in Alice's message is
run through a one-way hash algorithm (the algorithm maps a
message of any length to a shorter hash result which is virtually
unique to the message, and it is computationally infeasible to
derive the original message from the hash result). The hash
result is then encrypted by applying the public key of Bob the
recipient. When Bob the recipient authenticates the origin of the
message as coming from Alice, Bob also verifies the integrity of
the message by (i) applying his own (Bob the recipient's) private
key to decrypt the transmitted hash result; and (ii) comparing
the decrypted hash result with a second hash result which Bob the
recipient himself prepares from the transmitted message.<p>

With reversible public key cryptosystems such as RSA and PGP, it
is optionally possible to add the security service of
confidentiality to digital signature and message integrity.
Alice's software first digitally signs her message with Alice's
private key, and then super-encrypts the signed message for
privacy with Bob's public key. Bob decrypts the signed message
with Bob's private key, and then verifies that the message was
signed by Alice (and not since altered) with Alice's public
key.<p>

<H4>Certification Authorities to Block Spoofing of Public
Key</h4>

The potential weak spot in the public key cryptosystem is the
possibility that Imp, the imposter, will manage to secretly
substitute Imp's own public key (Imp has the matching private
key) for the public key of another person, which would nullify or
weaken all of the security services offered by the public key
cryptosystem{n.6}. To plug this potential compromise of security,
trusted third parties called Certification Authorities (CAs) are
being developed to bind a key-pair to the identity of its
owner.<p>

How does the CA work? The user will (i) generate her own
public/private key pair; (ii) produce proof of user identity
(including a visit in person) to the satisfaction of the CA;
(iii) furnish her public key to the CA; and (iv) and use software
to demonstrate possession of the complementary private key
without disclosing the private key itself. When satisfied, the CA
will bundle a digital copy of the user's public key together with
a digital certificate of the CA to the effect that the named user
owns this public key, and the CA will digitally sign the entire
package with the CA's private key. CAs will have other duties,
such as maintaining certificate revocation lists (CRLs) of public
keys which are no longer valid because the private key has been
lost or otherwise compromised. CAs are generally organized with
some degree (either flat or steep) of hierarchical structure, so
that each CA will have its own certificates validated by
certificates issued by higher-level CAs, and so on up the chain
until it ends in the top level, known as the root.<p> 

<H4>ABA's [American Bar Association's] InfoSec Committee's
Digital Signature Guidelines</h4>

Shortly before press time, the ABA's Information Security
Committee{n.7} published Digital Signature Guidelines{n.8}, setting
forth general legal principles and commentary for a public key
infrastructure to support a robust system of electronic commerce
based on digital signatures for use in open systems such as the
Internet. Reflecting many years of interdisciplinary study, the
Guidelines set forth a consistent system for apportioning
responsibility with certainty among the principal actors in
paperless commerce: the digital signer, the CA, and the party who
relies upon the digital signature as verified by the CA's
certificate binding the identity of the digital signer to the
key-pair owned by the signer. The Information Security Committee
is currently continuing its study by considering models for
legislative implementation of the Guidelines principles,
including the pioneering Utah Digital Signature Law enacted March
9, 1995{n.9}.<p> 

<H4>Promiscuous, Monogamous and Polygamous Models</h4>

The Guidelines have chosen to address the demanding security
needs of the most challenging model of electronic commerce (I
have nicknamed it the promiscuous model{n.10} of electronic
commerce) on the hostile and open system consisting of the
Internet and its World Wide Web, namely isolated transactions
among strangers in a many-to-many topology. At the opposite end
of the pole, representing traditional EDI (electronic data
interchange) as conducted between frequent bilateral trading
partners in a one-on-one topology, often within a closed and
protected system such as a VAN, is the monogamous model of
electronic commerce. The monogamous model has in the past
operated with single-key or no encryption, and may perhaps
continue to do so with acceptable security risk, at least until
such time as the seemingly irresistible lure of the Internet
increases the exposure to hackers.<p>

What I call the polygamous{n.11} model of electronic commerce is a
cryptographic halfway house on the Internet which combines
features of both the promiscuous and the monogamous models. The
polygamous model has a topology of one-to-many, based upon a
single central figure (e.g., a merchant, a bank, a credit card
company, an online service provider) which interacts directly
with many subscribers, none of whom interact commercially with
each other. This structure, which is common today, may offer the
opportunity for using public-key encryption securely without the
need for independent CAs. Instead, the central figure will
certify the key-pairs of its subscribers for purposes of its own
reliance only, without risk of CA liability to third parties who
may rely on a mistaken public key certificate. Such a system
could tolerate pseudonymous and possibly even anonymous
subscribers, by providing a security service whose objective is
to authenticate origin not absolutely, but merely relatively, by
answering the question "Is this message signed by the same person
who is my subscriber and promptly pays my invoices?" Moreover,
because there is privity of contract between the only commercial
actors in the polygamous model, it may be possible, through
bilateral trading partner agreements between the central figure
and each of its subscribers, to adopt rules which take the place
of the legislation needed under the promiscuous model of
electronic commerce.<p>

<H4>Public Key Crypto for Attorney/Client Confidentiality</h4>

Business attorneys dealing with their clients and other business
attorneys have an obvious major need for the security service of
confidentiality. The security services provided by digital
signatures (authentication, message integrity and non-
repudiation) can also be useful, but are of lesser importance to
the attorney than confidentiality. Business lawyers typically
have only dozens or hundreds (not thousands) of confidential
correspondents, with a topology that can be described as
few-to-few, and increasingly lawyers are being attracted to the
hostile and open environment of the Internet's World Wide Web.
Public-key cryptography is ideal for the needs of lawyers in this
circumstance. Although the topology is the same shape as the
topology in the promiscuous model, the limited size of the
universe of correspondents allows all public key certification to
be performed first-hand, with contract privity, for reliance by
the certifying attorney only, analogous to the situation under
the polygamous model.<p>

<H4>Encryption Software Export Restrictions</h4>

A major obstacle to the national and global development of a
secure public key infrastructure continues to be the strong
hostility of the U.S. security and law enforcement establishment
toward strong public key encryption, namely any cryptosystem
which cannot be readily, quickly and cheaply broken with the
brute force of the massively parallel processing systems and
supercomputers of the NSA (National Security Association), or
which has decryption keys deposited in escrow in a manner so as
to cause them to be available to law enforcement agencies upon
wiretap order. This hostility has been expressed in a variety of
strategies and tactics which have had the effect of delaying and
hindering the development and spread of public key encryption,
including (i) the Clipper Chip initiative announced April 16,
1993, and subsequently embodied in the Escrowed Encryption
Standard, mandatory for the federal government but voluntary for
the private sector; (ii) occasional speeches by federal
officials, suggesting that the use of unescrowed strong
encryption might be made illegal, as in France; (iii) continued
restrictions upon export of strong encryption products considered
"munitions" or "defense items" under ITAR (International Traffic
in Arms Regulations){n.12}. 


<H4>Only "Crypto-Lite" Software Is Exportable</h4>

At the current time, encryption software with a key-length of
40-bits{n.13} is exportable outside the U.S. and Canada under ITAR.
NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) proposed in
August of 1995 to allow export of 64-bit software upon condition
that it be escrowed so as to be amenable to wiretap order. That
same week, a French college student succeeded in breaking 40-bit
encryption software with brute force over a few days, using an
assortment of two supercomputers and a hundred or so powerful
workstations. The difference of cracking difficulty between
40-bits and 64-bits is a factor of 10 to the 7th power or 10
million. Both become cheaper and faster as computing power
increases over time. Bruce Schneier estimates that $1 million of
specialized hardware in the year 1995 can crack a 40-bit key in
.2 seconds or crack a 64-bit key in 38 days. In the year 2000,
however, the time to crack the 40-bit key will reduce to .02
seconds, and the 64-bit key to 4 days. In the past, such
projections of increased computer power and speed have tended to
be overly conservative. Both RSA and PGP ViaCrypt support a
key-length of 128-bits in their domestic products, which is 10 to
the 19th power harder to crack than the 64-bit key!{n.14} 

Has it become "computationally feasible" to crack the exportable
encryption software? Most likely by the NSA, but probably still
not by the foreseeable private hacker in 1995. The fact remains,
that U.S. export policies are clearly hindering the global
deployment by U.S. corporations, of standard industrial-strength
software of 128 bits which is safely out of reach of hackers for
the foreseeable future, and forcing the use of clearly inferior,
"crypto-lite" configurations. Because public key cryptosystems
used for digital signature are also based upon such encryption
algorithms, the U.S. policies hamper the development of
commercially important digital signature software as well as the
privacy encryption software which is intended target of the
export restrictions. And finally, another casualty of these
policies is the damage done to the U.S. balance of payments, as
those who need robust encryption are forced to import rather than
export software{n.15}. Almost 30 months after the Clipper Chip
initiative was announced{n.16}, there is little sign of any
softening in these policies, and they need a hard re-examination,
so that the law-enforcement objective can be weighed against the
competing goal of secure electronic commerce and e-mail.<p>

13 This is the key length of the conventional, single key algorithm which is
part of a typical public key cryptosystem, being RC4 in the RSA cryptosystem,
and IDEA in the PGP cryptosystem. Both RSA and PGP use the RSA algorithm for
key-distribution algorithm, which is based on the factoring of the product of
two huge primes. The size of the product to be factored is typically either 300
decimal digits (1024 binary bits) or 600 decimal digits (2048 binary bits). In
1993 a Bellcore team broke a product 129 decimal digits long (about 400 binary
bits) in about a year, using approximately 1000 workstations cooperating via the
Internet.<p>

15 In the U.S., PGP ViaCrypt 2.7 is a 128-bit product which is licensed for
commercial use in the U.S. Outside the U.S., it is a simple matter to download
PGP 2.6ui ("unofficial international", whose code was written entirely outside
the U.S.) from a number of Internet sites which are outside the U.S. PGP 2.6ui
is a 128-bit product which is interoperable with PGP ViaCrypt 2.7. PGP 2.6ui
allegedly would infringe U.S. patents if it were used in the U.S., but there are
no corresponding patents outside the U.S. The net result is that a U.S.
corporation or attorney can achieve global (except in certain countries which
prohibit the use of strong encryption) secure 128-bit security services today by
using PGP ViaCrypt 2.7 in the U.S., and by asking its correspondents outside the
U.S. to obtain and use PGP ViaCrypt 2.6ui outside the U.S.<p> 


16 "Quite simply, the hopelessly polarized warfare over the privacy issues of
cryptography has confused and hampered constructive progress toward a
cryptographic system of digital signatures for the more commercially significant
purposes of authentication and nonrepudiation, where consensus is perhaps more
easily attainable." Charles R. Merrill, "Cryptography for Commerce--Beyond
Clipper," 2 The DateLaw Report No. 2 (Sept 1994), p 4.<p>

<H3>PERSONAL USE OF COMPUTERS AND THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA</h3>


An employee's occasional use of ____________'s computer facilities to
type a term paper for an educational course or prepare an announcement
for a charitable event is acceptable. However, in order to keep these
uses to a reasonable level, approval to use the system in such a manner
must be given by the employee's supervisor. Moreover, please be aware
that ____________ may purge files on its computer at any time without
notice.<p>

The use of the system for such personal efforts must occur outside of
business hours, and any files created are to be deleted at the end of
the project. Also, because of the normal heavy load on the system, these
outside projects will not receive priority over late evening operational
requirements, system maintenance, or file back-up.<p>

Using the computer facilities for other than educational or charitable
activities, following the procedures described above, is not
permitted.<p>

All information stored in the computer system or data files or word
processing documents, is to be treated as confidential information, of a
proprietary nature to the Company. Only certain information printed out
as a word processing document for purposes of public correspondence may
be considered non-proprietary or non-confidential.<p> 

Libraries for filing word processing documents have been identified for
individual's use and for department's use. Access to libraries not
related to the performance of one's job assignment is viewed as
inappropriate behavior. Such action is similar to going through another
employee's desk drawers and files. Accordingly, such inappropriate
behavior will be subject to appropriate discipline, up to and including
discharge.<p>

<H2>Romantic or Sexual Relationships</h2>

<H2>The Ultimate Employee Handbook -- A Workshop</h2>

<H3>Romantic or Sexual Relationships</h3>

Consenting "romantic" or sexual relationships between a
supervisor/manager and an employee may at some point lead to
unhappy complications and significant difficulties for all
concerned - the employee, the supervisor/manager and the Company.
Any such relationship may, therefore, be contrary to the best
interests of the Company. Accordingly, the Company strongly
discourages such relationship and any conduct (such as dating
between a supervisor/manager and an employee) that is designed or
may reasonably be expected to lead to the formation of a
"romantic" or sexual relationship.<p>

By its discouragement of romantic and sexual relationships, the
Company does not intend to inhibit the social interaction (such
as lunches or dinners or attendance at entertainment events) that
are or should be an important part or extension of the working
environment; and the policy articulated above is not to be relied
upon as justification or excuse for a supervisor's/manager's
refusal to engage in such social interaction with employees.<p>

If a romantic or sexual relationship between a supervisor/manager
and an employee should develop, it shall be the responsibility
and mandatory obligation of the supervisor/manager promptly to
disclose the existence of the relationship to the employee's
Department Vice President. The employee may make the disclosure
as well, but the burden of doing so shall be upon the
supervisor/manager.<p> 

The Company recognizes the ambiguity of and the variety of
meanings that can be given to the term "romantic". It is assumed,
or at least hoped, however, that either or both of the parties to
such a relationship will appreciate the meaning of the term as it
applies to either or both of them and will act in a manner
consistent with this policy.<p>

The Department Vice President shall inform the Company's
Management Committee and others with a need-to-know of the
existence of the relationship, including in all cases the person
responsible for the employee's work assignments. Upon being
informed or learning of the existence of such a relationship, the
Company's Management Committee may take all steps that it, in its
discretion, deems appropriate.<p> 

At a minimum, the employee and supervisor/manager will not
thereafter be permitted to work together on the same matters
(including matters pending at the time disclosure of the
relationship is made), and the supervisor/manager must withdraw
from participation in activities or decisions (including, but not
limited to, hiring, evaluations, promotions, compensation, work
assignments and discipline) that may reward or disadvantage any
employee with whom the supervisor/manager has or has had such a
relationship.<p>

In addition, and in order for the Company to deal effectively
with any potentially adverse consequences such a relationship may
have for the working environment, any person who believes that he
or she has been adversely affected by such a relationship,
notwithstanding its disclosure, is encouraged to make his or her
views about the matter known to the President of the Company, a
Department Vice President, the Chief Operating Officer or
Ombudsman.<p>

This policy shall apply without regard to gender and without
regard to the sexual orientation of the participants in a
relationship of the kind described.<p>

veteran, or status as a qualified individual with a disability,

in accordance with applicable laws. Our firm will not tolerate

any unlawful discrimination and any such conduct is

prohibited.<p>



Our Firm also prohibits any harassment based on the legally

protected categories set forth above. Harassment is verbal or

physical conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion

towards an individual because of these protected attributes, and

that (1) has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating,

hostile, or offensive working environment as defined by law; or

(2) has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an

individual's work performance; or (3) otherwise adversely effects

an individual's employment opportunities.<p>



All employees, regardless of position or title, will be subject

to severe discipline, up to and including discharge, should the

Firm determine that an employee is engaged in unlawful

harassment. The Firm will promptly and thoroughly investigate the

facts and circumstances of any harassment claim.<p>



If you feel you are being unlawfully harassed, report this to

your supervisor immediately, or if you prefer, report the problem

to your Department Head or the Personnel Director. No one will be

subject to, and the Firm prohibits, any form of discipline or

retaliation for reporting incidents of unlawful harassment or

pursuing any such claim.<p>



<hr><p>



*NOTE: This policy refers to categories of employees protected

under a variety of federal and state laws. Some jurisdictions

prohibit additional types of discrimination, however, so be sure

to check local laws.<p>



The harassment policy is based upon the EEOC's proposed

guidelines on harassment, published on October 1, 1993. The

guidelines are undergoing revision as of this date, and employers

should monitor any changes.<p>

<H3>Phone and E-mail Policy</h3>



<STRONG>PURPOSE: To ensure that the use of electronic and telephonic

communication systems and business equipment is consistent with

________'s business interests.</strong><p>



E-mail and phone mail provide many advantages to the Corporation

including:<p><OL>



<LI>reducing telephone tag<p>



<LI>speeding up decision making<p>



<LI>shortening the communication cycle</ol><p>



These are factors that improve productivity and provide the

ability to communicate with other employees at virtually anytime

and at any location.<p>



The disadvantage is that employees assume their messages are

private, but privacy is not guaranteed. E-mail and phone mail

files are like other company files and can be used in the

discovery process linked to litigation. Additionally, because

E-mail and phone mail allow an immediate response, many users do

so without a second thought. The potential risk is increased due

to the ability to respond so quickly that a person may later

regret what was written or said.<p>



<STRONG>SCOPE: All electronic and telephonic communication

systems and all communication and information transmitted by,

received from, or stored in these systems are the property of the

____________________, and as such are to be used for job-related

communications only.</strong><p>



<STRONG>POLICY: E-mail or phone mail shall not be used to

transmit vulgar, profane, insulting or offensive messages such as

racial or sexual slurs. Prohibited uses of E-mail and phone mail

include, but are not limited to, soliciting outside business

ventures, advertising for personal enterprises or soliciting for

non-company related purposes. This policy does not prohibit

personal messages of a social nature which do not contain

otherwise prohibited content.</strong><p>



Employees are not permitted to use passwords, access a file, or

retrieve any stored communication unless authorized to do so, or

unless they have received prior clearance from an authorized

________ representative. All passwords are the property of

________.<p>



Authorized representatives of ________, from time to time, may

monitor the use of such equipment. Such monitoring may include

accessing recorded messages and printing and reading data files

by ________ employees who are authorized to do so by management.<p> 



Employees who violate this policy are subject to disciplinary

action up to and including termination.<p>



As a condition of employment and continued employment, employees

are required to sign an E-mail/Phone Mail Acknowledgement Form

(Exhibit 1). Applicants are required to sign this form on

acceptance of an employment offer by ________ or during their new

hire orientation process.<p>



<hr><p>



<STRONG>EXHIBIT 1</strong><p>



EMPLOYMENT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FORM<p>



I understand that all telephonic and electronic communication

systems and all information transmitted by, received from, or

stored in these systems is the property of ____________________.

I also understand that, although personal messages of a social

nature which do not contain otherwise prohibited content are

permitted, these systems are not to be used for soliciting

outside business ventures, advertising for personal enterprises

or soliciting for non-company related purposes, and that I have

no expectation of privacy in connection with the use of this

equipment or with the transmission, receipt or storage of

information in this equipment.<p>



I agree never to use another person's password, access a file or

retrieve any stored communication, unless authorized. I

acknowledge and consent to ____________________ monitoring my use

of this equipment at any time at its discretion. Such monitoring

may include the interception of telephonic communication and

printing and reading all E-mail entering, leaving or stored in

these systems.<p><UL>

FOREWORD<p>



Today's workers are more litigious than ever before. Every

employment-related lawsuit involves some aspect of the policies

and practices applied by management to solving people-problems in

the workplace. These operating rules frequently are set forth in

an employee handbook or personnel policies manual. In the course

of the trial of these cases, some executives will be

cross-examined on what the handbook rules mean, and how they are

applied. The case may be tried before a jury, with both actual

and punitive damages awardable. Verdicts against employers are

running into millions of dollars.<p>



This new type of litigation may charge that breach of an "implied

contract" has occurred because an employer failed to follow some

work rule in an employee handbook, or that an employee was

damaged by reliance on management's promise of benefits set forth

in the handbook.<p>



Courts have also interpreted the provisions of some handbooks as

a contractual limitation on the common law managerial right to

discharge employees. For example, the highest court in Texas had

declared that:<p>



"--absolute employment-at-will is a relic of early industrial

times, conjuring up visions of the sweatshops described by

Charles Dickens and his contemporaries. The doctrine belongs in a

museum, not in our law."<p>



As a result, some workers are beginning to claim that their jobs

are like a vested property right, and it is no wonder that

employers have suffered "handbook horrors." A few firms have

reacted by eliminating their handbooks altogether. The question

thus arises whether it is advisable to maintain an employee

handbook and, if so, how can an employer best draft the handbook

to maximize its human relations benefits while at the same time

minimizing the legal risks?<p> 



Our answer is that, as a practical matter, the greater risk is

posed by abandoning your handbook and relying on unwritten work

rules because the same courts have also held that ORAL

representations to employees and established but unwritten

practices can be just as contractually binding. These cases are

difficult to defend because of the credibility gap in proving

what management's policy or practice really was. The factual

determination may be sent to a jury where (psychologically) it's

the "poor, helpless, downtrodden worker" versus the "big, bad,

rich, powerful employer".<p> 



On the other hand, if workplace policies and benefits are clearly

stated IN WRITING, there can be no question about what they mean.

A well-drafted and consistently applied personnel policy manual

or handbook thus can serve a number of useful purposes. It

provides an effective tool for training supervisors and orienting

new employees. Without such a manual, inadequate

employee/management communications can result in workers not

having any concept of corporate policies, not knowing how to

communicate, and not understanding the company's work rules.

Supervisors will be unable to answer employee questions quickly

and accurately. This could lead to erroneous interpretations of

company policies as well as inconsistent application of work

rules, complaints and grievances, discipline, benefits -- and

eventually to costly lawsuits.<p> 



One of an employer's best defenses in a union organizing

campaign, moreover, is the ability to counter the so-called

"security" of a labor contract (as advertised by the union) with

an employee handbook that similarly sets forth equal or better

benefits, real job security, and favorable work rules for

employees. Furthermore, an excellent defense in equal employment

opportunity litigation raising claims of disparate treatment is

management's ability to show its good faith attempt to comply

with civil rights laws protecting minority groups and prove that

non-discriminatory employment policies were established, were

communicated to employees through a handbook, and applied

consistently by supervisors. Finally, the properly drafted

disciplinary rules in a handbook can assist management in

defending itself against employee lawsuits for "implied

agreements" and "wrongful or abusive discharge." <p>



While the law concerning the interpretation and enforceability of

employee handbooks is in a developing mode, three major drafting

precautions can be gleaned from the cases to date:<p>



First, as noted above, employer must recognize that some

provisions of the handbook may be interpreted as contractually

binding on management. It therefore is essential to remove or

amend all policies and benefits that you do not intend to follow

consistently.<p>



Second, because the potential contractual liability of the

handbook may be negated by legally protective language, employers

should include such disclaimers where consistent with their

employee relations objectives. For example, the handbook should

include a statement that it is not intended to be an express or

implied contract of employment. The handbook should also state

that employees can be discharged at will at any time, without

prior notice or warning, in management's discretion. Employers

should be aware that some courts require these disclaimers to be

prominently placed in order to have any effect.<p> 



Third, because an employer's obligations under a contract cannot

exceed what was promised, every handbook drafter should consider

including broad reservations of managerial prerogatives. At the

least, the handbook should reserve management's right to amend or

delete any handbook provision. Many more disclaimers and caveats

developed by our law firm to protect legitimate management

functions are included in this handbook manual.<p> 



A final word of caution: depending on how strongly the handbook's

legal disclaimers and caveats are worded, they may tend to

undermine the human relations value that the handbook is intended

to promote. Management therefore must balance the legal

protective value of such statements against their possible

detrimental impact on employee morale and job security. Certain

compromises are noted herein.<p> 



In summary, those handbook horrors can be avoided. But it takes a

friendly, people-oriented approach as well as careful drafting,

an attractive and readable format, plus thorough legal review.

Under these conditions, an employee handbook should be one of

management's best friends.<p> 



HOW TO USE THIS MODEL HANDBOOK<p>



The Model Employee Handbook manual is a compendium of policies

and procedures on various workplace subjects from recruitment to

retirement that might appear in your Employee Handbook. The

authors have drafted and reviewed literally hundreds of handbooks

and policy statements for use in a wide variety of employment

settings, bringing that experience to bear in composing the

statements and provisions you will find here.<p>



This Model Employee Handbook manual should assist you in drafting

your own handbook, tailored to the specific needs of the

NON-UNION employees in your Firm. Our manual is divided into

EIGHT MAJOR TOPICS, with sub-sections titled and numbered as

indicated in the TABLE OF CONTENTS that follows. Some sub-

sections contain more than one policy draft sample. They are

designated as SAMPLE A, SAMPLE B, etc., for your consideration.<p> 



Throughout this manual we have also inserted FOOTNOTES at the end

of each section in order to remind you of the need for special

review of certain provisions, or to mention relevant state or

federal laws and court decisions, or provide you with additional

information about the reasons underlying specific handbook

clauses. These footnotes are NOT to be republished as part of

your actual employee handbook.<p> 



Our manual thus is a general guide to the types of provisions

that are frequently included in handbooks. It also contains NOVEL

provisions that we have developed in our law firm to help protect

your managerial prerogatives in an increasingly legalistic age.

These legal disclaimers and caveats have been approved and

enforced by federal and state courts in actual cases involving

defense of our clients.<p> 



No firm should adopt this Model Employee Handbook draft verbatim,

however. Every handbook should be tailored to the employer's

specific situation. Some of the provisions contained herein are

NOT appropriate for every firm. You should only use this manual

as a STARTING POINT, and mold the suggested language to fit your

own situation and convey the message you want to express.<p> 



A basic goal of every employee handbook should be to engender a

positive response from employees. They need to identify with your

Firm; to realize that what is good for your business is good for

them too. The handbook, as one of a new employee's first

experiences with your Firm, can initiate that response. Its style

and format should be upbeat and friendly. It should contain

provisions that foster a sense of well-being and security on the

part of employees.<p> 



Since one of the aims of an employee handbook is to communicate,

it must be organized and written in a style that is

understandable. The basic rule is: KEEP IT SIMPLE, CLEAR, AND

BRIEF. The language used should not be complex or burdensome. The

only EXCEPTION to this general rule of style is -- regrettable

but necessarily -- the legal disclaimers and caveats that appear

in some of the following pages of our manual. These provisions

must be written in "legalese" for your protection and

independence of operation, with managerial prerogatives intact.<p> 



Decide what it is you want to say and provide for your workers,

and consider fully the commitments of each policy and benefit.

Try to keep the tone of the handbook personal. Avoid cold third

person references such as "the employee" and "the management."

Instead, use "you," "we," and other terms of familiarity and

informality whenever possible.<p> 



Charts often convey and supplement information in a clearer, more

concise manner than long narratives. Photographs and graphics

also help make the ideas you wish to communicate easier to

understand and more interesting to read.<p> 



Be careful about highlighting distinctions among various classes

of workers. If the salaried employees in your office have a more

generous vacation schedule than the mechanics on your job sites,

or if one group of employees has more lenient sign-in and relief

procedures than another, the differences could create legal or

people-problems if highlighted in the handbook. The fairest

solution is to treat everyone alike -- at least as to published

work rules and benefits, and keep executive "perks" unlisted.<p> 



Be sure to include specific reservations of management's

discretionary authority to operate its business and direct its

work force. Choose your terminology carefully, thinking through

the nature of the prerogative you want to protect and how to

protect it. Obviously, this is an element of the handbook where

labor counsel is essential. You can avoid many of the pitfalls

that have resulted in protracted litigation for other companies.<p> 



Be wary of allowing employees to have access to supervisors'

personnel policy manuals. Some firms publish a separate,

comprehensive management brochure that explains in more detail

the policies contained in the employee handbook, or even adds

additional work rules. Remember the same legal principles that

apply to your handbook apply to a lengthy supervisors' policy

booklet. We believe the safer practice is to avoid such

supplementary guidebooks, and advise your Supervisors either to

handle employee questions personally or refer them to your

Director of Human Resources for consistency in administration

under your handbook.<p> 



In addition, we strongly recommend that you review the latest

legal requirements in your state (statutes, court and

administrative rulings) with regard to employee benefits,

workplace rules, employee handbooks and policy manuals. Many laws

concerning employees are governed on the local level, and they

vary from state to state.<p> 



You should also make the outside cover of your handbook pleasing

to the eye. Bold type communicates clearly. Remember that the

cover is an opportunity to present both your company logo in a

positive yet personal way to your employees.<p> 



Avoid making your handbook unwieldy to read and handle. The more

compact and convenient to use the handbook is, the more likely

employees will keep it close at hand and refer to it. Loose leaf

booklets are expensive and the amended pages sent out

periodically to employees are seldom filed.<p> 



An employee handbook must, of course, be used in conjunction with

effective supervisory training on how to administer it firmly,

consistently and fairly. All policies and work rules that appear

in the handbook must be uniformly enforced by your supervisors

and other managerial personnel. The positive-but- friendly

attitude that you hope to generate through the handbook must be

supported and implemented by your entire management team.<p> 



Finally, we repeat that this Model Employee Handbook manual is

not intended to apply to any particular employer or to provide

legal advice or opinion. Such advice may only be given when

related to specific handbooks and specific fact situations.<p>



1.0  INTRODUCTION<p>



1.1  About This Handbook*<p>



Our Firm has always believed in promoting an atmosphere of open

communication and cooperation among all of our personnel. This

Employee Handbook reflects that thinking. It supersedes in all

respects any prior handbook, policy manual, benefits or practices

of the Firm and has been prepared for our [OPTIONAL:

non-managerial or non-executive, non-officer, non-supervisory,

non-exempt, non-represented, or other definition of those covered

by the Handbook if not all employees are covered] employees** to

provide you with general information about some of your benefits

and the highlights of rules and policies under which we operate.

Obviously, we could not begin to explain every Firm policy or

rule or benefit in this Handbook, and its provisions can be

considered as no more than general summaries of the benefits,

work rules and policies they address.<p> 



While we hope our personnel actions will continue to be positive,

from time to time our Firm may unilaterally, in its discretion,

amend, supplement, modify, or eliminate one or more of the

benefits, work rules or policies described in this Handbook, or

any other employment benefits, work rules or policies, without

prior notice.***<p> 



This Handbook does not constitute a guarantee that your

employment will continue for any specified period of time or end

only under certain conditions. NOTHING IN THE HANDBOOK

CONSTITUTES AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT OR

WARRANTY OF ANY BENEFITS. Employment at our Firm is a voluntary

employment-at-will relationship for no definite period of time.

While we hope to have a long and mutually beneficial working

relationship together, regardless of anything which may appear in

this Handbook or any other Firm publication, policy, statement or

practice, you have the right to terminate your employment

relationship for any reason with or without cause or notice at

any time, and the Firm reserves the right to do the same to amend

or delete handbook provisions. Although the disclaimer contained

here should provide substantial protection, employers may want to

consider providing some new benefit to employees when the

handbook is significantly changed, so that binding consideration

for the change can be shown to exist.<p>

<H3>Harassment: Policy Statement</h3>



All ____________ employees have a right to work in an environment

free from all forms of discrimination and conduct which can be

considered harassing, coercive, or disruptive. Consistent with

____________'s respect for the rights and dignity of each

employee, harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual

orientation, national origin, age, disability, marital status,

citizenship or any other characteristic protected by law, will

not be sanctioned nor tolerated. All employees should, therefore,

be aware of the following: <p>



A. Sexual harassment is strictly prohibited. Sexual harassment

has been defined by government regulation as unwelcome sexual

advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or

physical conduct of a sexual nature . . . when submission to such

conduct is made, either explicitly or implicitly, a term or

condition of an individual's employment;. . . [when] submission

to or rejection of such conduct . . . is used as the basis for

employment decisions affecting such individual; or . . . such

conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering

with the individual's work performance or creating an

intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.<p>



B. Harassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic

is also strictly prohibited. Under this policy, harassment is

verbal or physical conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or

aversion toward an individual because of his/her race, color,

religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age,

disability, marital status, citizenship or any other

characteristic protected by law or that of his/her relatives,

friends or associates, and that:<p><OL>



<LI>has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating,

hostile, or offensive work environment;<p>



<LI>has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an

individual's work performance; or<p>



<LI>otherwise adversely affects an individual's employment.

Harassing conduct includes, but is not limited to: epithets,

slurs, or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating or

hostile acts; and written or graphic material that denigrates or

shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group and

that is placed on walls or elsewhere on the employer's premises

or circulated in the workplace.</ol><p>



C. Supervisors and managers are responsible for assuring that no

employee is subjected to conduct that constitutes sexual or any

other form of harassment.<p>



D. Any individual found to have engaged in sexual or any other

form of harassment will be disciplined as appropriate, up to and

including discharge.<p> 



E. Any employee who believes that he or she has been the subject

of sexual or any other form of harassment by anyone at

____________ or by any person who does business with

____________, should, and is encouraged to, bring the matter to

the attention of his/her supervisor, or the ____________

Department.<p> 



F. A prompt and thorough investigation of the alleged incident

will be conducted to the extent possible, and appropriate

corrective action will be taken if warranted. To the extent

consistent with adequate investigation and appropriate corrective

action, any complaints of harassment will be treated as

confidential.<p> 



G. ____________ will not in any way retaliate against an

employee, potential employee, or former employee who, in good

faith, makes a complaint or report of harassment, or participates

in the investigation of such a complaint or report. Retaliation

against any individual for in good faith reporting a claim of

harassment or cooperating in the investigation of same will not

be tolerated and will itself be subject to appropriate

discipline. ____________ will take all appropriate steps to

enforce this Policy.<p>

<H2>Seven Basic Rules on Solicitation</h2>

<H3>SEVEN BASIC RULES ON SOLICITATION BY EMPLOYEES AND ACCESS TO THE

EMPLOYER'S PRIVATE PROPERTY</h3>



<h4>Copyright 1995 by Gerard Morales</h4><OL>



<LI>During non-working times, the employees' right to engage in

solicitation and to distribute literature in non-working areas is

protected by the National Labor Relations Act. e.g., <I>Anderson

Company</i>, 305 NLRB 878 (1991).<p>



<LI>Because of the disruption which solicitation and/or

distribution may create in the workplace, however, an employer

may adopt and enforce rules prohibiting solicitation during

working time and distribution in working areas. <I>Our Way</i>, 268 NLRB

394 (1983). Nevertheless, as a general proposition, if the

employer permits solicitations by employees for outside entities,

"even for admirable, charitable and benevolent purposes," it

cannot argue that union solicitations create an intolerable

disruption because their purpose is less admirable. e.g.,

<I>Sunnyland Packing Company</i>, 227 NLRB 590.<p>



<LI>An employer may prohibit non-employees seeking to communicate

with its employees from coming into the employer's private

property, except in the rare case where "the inaccessibility of

employees makes ineffective the reasonable attempts of

nonemployees to communicate with them through the usual

channels." e.g., <I>Lechmere, Inc.</i>, v. NLRB, 502 U.S. 527

(1992).<p>



<LI>An employer may not prohibit off-duty employees from gaining

access to its premises except if it: a) limits access solely with

respect to the interior of the plant and other working areas; b)

clearly disseminates the prohibition to all employees; and c)

applies the prohibition to off-duty employees seeking access for

any reason. A rule that denies off-duty employees entry to

non-working areas, such as parking lots, would be invalid, unless

justified by business reasons. e.g., <I>Tri-County Medical Center</i>,

222 NLRB 1089 (1976).<p>



<LI>The employer's electronic and telephonic communication

systems may be limited to business-related purposes only.<p>



<LI>Employees have the protected right to wear union insignia

while at work, unless special circumstances apply. Exposure to

customers or general public, standing alone, is not a sufficient

"special circumstance" to justify prohibiting the display of such

insignia by employees. e.g., <I>United Parcel Service</i>, 312

NLRB No. 103 (1993). (Some courts of appeal disagree with the

NLRB in this area. See e.g., <I>United Parcel Service v.

NLRB</i>, 41 F.3d 1068 (6th Cir. 1994).)<p>



<LI>When an employer permits its employees to utilize its

bulletin boards for the posting of notices relating to personal

items, it may not validly discriminate against notices of union

meetings, etc., an employer's motivation, no matter how well

meant, is irrelevant. e.g., <I>Guardian Industries Corp.</i>, 313

NLRB 1275 (1994). (Here, also, some courts of appeal have

disagreed with the Board. <I>Guardian Industries Corp. v.

NLRB</i>, 148 LRRM 2665 (7th Cir. 1995).)</ol><p>

<H4>Author's caveat: These documents do not constitute legal
advice or an opinion, which can only be provided after review of
specific facts.</h4>


<H3>A FEW WORDS ABOUT UNIONS*</h3>

(Sample A)<p>

Our Firm, like more than eight-percent of the businesses and
institutions throughout the United States, is
<STRONG>Union-Free</strong>. There is always a chance, however,
that in the future a labor union organizer will try to persuade
some of our employees to sign union authorization cards. For this
reason, it is important that you understand our position
concerning unions.<p>

To say it simply and clearly, although you have the legal right
to join a labor union, you also have the legal right
<STRONG>NOT</strong> to join a union. We believe that remaining
union-free has definite advantages for you, our employees. For
instance, along with labor unions come the possibility of many
changes such as (a) restrictions of individual freedom to discuss
and solve your problems directly with us without any union
involvement; (b) your compulsory union membership and dues; (c)
union discipline, fines, suspension and expulsion from
membership; (d) union control over you through the union's
constitution and bylaws; (e) union politics; (f) union coercion
and violence; (g) union hypocrisy; (h) union strikes and strike
assessments; (i) resulting job replacements, sometimes temporary,
sometimes forever. In other words -- over the years, some unions
have fostered turmoil, job insecurity, dollars out of workers'
pockets, and loss of independence.<p>

So if a labor union organizer ever asks you to sign a union
authorization card, remember that it can be a legally binding
document in which you may sign away your right of individual
freedom in our workplace for exclusive representation by that
union. We hope you would hesitate -- and think carefully --
before signing any such union pledge card. It could be your first
step into the workplace turmoil described above. It might be like
signing a blank check and giving it to a stranger!<p>

<hr><p>

*NOTE: Many executives are not aware that, in exercising freedom
of speech, they have a legal right to advise their employees of
the Firm's opinion that representation by a labor union is not in
the employees' best interest. So long as you do not
<STRONG>THREATEN</strong> employees with reprisals if they
unionize, or <STRONG>PROMISE</strong> improved benefits if they
refrain from unionizing, it is perfectly legal to tell your
employees that you do not believe they need a union, and explain
why. However, it is important that your handbook not
<STRONG>REQUIRE</strong> employees to adhere to your non-union
policy as a condition of employment, as the National Labor
Relations Board has held that such a requirement can be found to
be an unfair labor practice.<p>


<H3>A FEW WORDS ABOUT UNIONS</h3>

(Sample B)<p>

There is always a chance that in the future a labor organizer will try
to persuade some of our employees to sign union authorization cards. For
this reason, it is important that you understand our position concerning
unions.<p> 

To say it simply and clearly, although you have the legal right to join
a labor union, you also have the legal right <STRONG>NOT</strong> to
join a labor union. We prefer to work with our employees informally,
personally, and directly, rather than through third party outsiders
intervening between us. We think you agree. So we will make every effort
that is legally permissible to retain our status as a NON-union
employer.<p> 


<H3>WORKING TOGETHER</h3>

(Sample C)<p>

The growth and personal achievement we have experienced at the Firm is
the result of working together in a spirit of cooperation and teamwork
that has enabled us to meet many difficult challenges. The progress that
has been achieved reflects this strong mutual commitment between the
Firm and our employees. All of this was done without third party
influence or interference. It is not necessary for any employee to join
or pay dues to any outside organization in order to work here.<p>

1.5 Our Policy Against Sexual Harassment<p>

It is illegal and strictly against the Firm's policy for any
employee, male or female, to harass another employee by: making
or subjecting any person to unwelcome sexual advances, unwelcome
requests for sexual favors, or to engage in any unwelcome other
verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, where --
submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment, or
submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as the basis
for an employment decision affecting the individual exposed to
such conduct, or -- where such conduct has the purpose or effect
of unreasonably interfering with an idividual's work performance
or creating an intimindating, hostile or offensive work
environment. 

The Firm will not condone or tolerate the sexual harassment of
its employees by their co-workers, supervisors or any individual
under our control. All employees, regardless of position or
title, will be subject to severe discipline, up to and including
discharge, should the Firm determine that an employee is engaged
in the sexual harassment of another individual. The Firm will
promptly and thoroughly investigate the facts and circumstances
of any claim of sexual harassment.<p>

If you feel that you are being subjected to sexual harassment,
you should report this to your supervisor immediately, or, if you
prefer for whatever reasons to discuss the matter with someone
else, report the problem to the supervisor's superior or to the
Personnel Director. No individual will be subject to, and it is
the Firm's policy to strictly prohibit, any form of discipline or
retaliation for reporting incidents of sexual harassment or
pursuing anyclaim of sexual harassment.<p>

<H3>CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE TO DIVERSITY</h3>

<H4>A Guide for Legal Employers on Eliminating Sexual Orientation
Discrimination</h4>

Bar Association of San Francisco<p>

August, 1991<p>

On August 14, 1991, the Board of Directors of the Bar Association
of San Francisco unanimously approved a Resolution adopting the
following Guide drafted by the Bar Association's Committee On Gay
and Lesbian Issues. The Resolution urges all San Francisco law
firms and legal employers to implement programs to achieve equal
employment opportunity for lesbians and gay men and to make the
recommendations contained in the following Guide the basis for
those equal opportunity programs.<p> 

<H4>Introduction</h4>

In 1986 the Bar Association of San Francisco ("BASF") established
the Committee on Equality, whose mandate was to study and make
recommendations to the BASF Board of Directors with respect to
the elimination of barriers to the advancement of minorities,
women, lesbians and gay men, and attorneys with physical or
mental impairments in the San Francisco legal community. The
Committee's efforts initially were focused on issues relating to
the advancement of ethnic minorities and women. However, in
January 1990, a subcommittee on lesbian and gay issues was
established, which has subsequently become a BASF committee.<p>

Over the past 18 months, the Committee on Lesbian and Gay Issues
("the Committee") has conducted exhaustive research to identify
obstacles to, and recommend ameliorative steps to effect, the
equal recruitment, hiring, retention, advancement and
compensation of gay and lesbian attorneys and law students in San
Francisco. The Committee's work included:<p><OL>

<LI>study of responses of those willing to respond to a survey
seeking the employment experiences of gay and lesbian attorneys,
conducted in 1988 by the Bay Area Lawyers for Individual Freedom
(BALIF);<p>

<LI>analysis and extrapolation from information collected by the
National Lesbian and Gay Bar Association;<p>

<LI>solicitation of input from prominent members of the San
Francisco legal community and evaluation of the legal, economic
and management considerations for legal employees seeking to
implement policies designed to achieve equal employment
opportunities for gay and lesbian lawyers and law students;
and<p>

<LI>drafting and final adoption by the Committee of this
Guide.</ol><p>

It is important to note that collection of data documenting this
form of discrimination is particularly problematic because many
gay and lesbian law students and attorneys are reluctant to
reveal their sexual orientation, and many legal organizations are
reluctant to collect data on the numbers of openly gay and
lesbian law students and employees.<p>

The work of the Committee culminated in its recommendation that
the Board of Directors endorse this Guide and urge its acceptance
and implementation by San Francisco legal employers.<p>

"Firm" is used interchangeably with "legal employer" in this
document for ease of reference. However, this policy is intended
for use by all legal employers, including law firms, corporate
legal departments, government agencies, law schools and
non-profit organizations. This policy primarily addresses issues
as they affect attorneys. The same considerations should often be
taken into account as they apply to staff and other legal
employees. On August 14, 1991, the BASF Board unanimously adopted
a resolution endorsing this Guide.<p>

<H4>Overview</h4>

Elimination of discrimination based on sexual orientation has
long been recognized by BASF to be a matter of great importance,
and one on which the BASF Board of Directors has taken strongly
supportive positions. These have included the following:
opposition to the Briggs Initiative which attempted to bar gay
men and lesbians from teaching in public schools; support for an
ABA resolution urging legislation to combat sexual orientation
discriminations; opposition to the La Rouche AIDS Initiatives and
Proposition 102, a proposed California initiative imposing
mandatory HIV testing of hospital patients; endorsement of a
local ordinance barring private club discrimination based, <I>inter
alia</i>, on sexual orientation; support in principle of a State Bar
disciplinary rule barring discriminatory conduct by attorneys
based, <I>inter alia</i>, on sexual orientation; and sponsorship of a
resolution proposed by the BASF delegation to the State Bar
Conference of Delegates endorsing legislation to allow same-sex
marriage in California (subsequently adopted without debate at
the Conference).<p>

Employer attitudes, policies and practices which impede the
advancement of lesbians and gay men may often be subtle and even
unconscious. Together with more blatant forms of discrimination
which continue to persist, however, they deprive individuals of
equal employment opportunity in the San Francisco legal
community.<p>

The Committee's research revealed that only 10 of the 957
partners in the local offices of the Bay Area's 15 largest firms
are openly gay or lesbian. While the percentage within the
associate ranks is likely to be higher, the Committee has
concluded that gay and lesbian attorneys are seriously
underrepresented at all levels and in all segments of the
profession.<p>

Removal of barriers to the advancement of gay and lesbian
employees is of particular importance in San Francisco. Bar
associations and legal employers across the country look to the
Bay Area for leadership on this issue, where arguably the largest
applicant pool of talented gay and lesbian law students and
attorneys in the nation exists.<p>

While researchers place the percentage of gay men and lesbian
women at ten percent of the national population, the percentage
in San Francisco is believed to be approximately twenty percent.
Although statistics are not available documenting the number of
gay and lesbian law students and attorneys in San Francisco or
nationally, there is no reason to believe that gay men and
lesbians are underrepresented in the bar, and San Francisco is
considered a very desirable location among many gay men and
lesbians. There are thriving gay and lesbian student associations
on most major law school campuses, including at Harvard, Yale,
Boalt, Hall, Hastings, The University of San Francisco, Golden
Gate and Stanford.<p>

However, discrimination based on sexual orientation has only
recently become the focus of study and action by the organized
bar here and elsewhere. The Association of the Bar of the City of
New York and BASF are among the few which have established
specialized committees on this issue, and both did so as late as
1990. Only after several years of defeat did the ABA adopt, in
1989, a resolution supporting legislation to combat
discrimination against lesbians and gay men.<p>

It has only recently been the subject of explicit
anti-discrimination legislation. In California, for example,
express legal prohibitions against employment discrimination on
the basis of sexual orientation are found only in local
ordinances, including a San Francisco ordinance. San Francisco
Municipal Code (Police) Article 33, Section 3303(a). California
Assembly Bill 101, as proposed in the 1991-92 legislative
session, would amend the California Fair Employment and Housing
Act to add an express prohibition against discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation. However, former Governor George
Deukmejian vetoed earlier legislation that would have prohibited
sexual orientation discrimination. Lesbians and gay men,
meanwhile, rely on California Labor Code Section 1101 and 1102,
as construed by the California Supreme Court and the California
Attorney General, for legal protection against employment
discrimination.<p>

Labor Code Sections 1101 and 1102 prohibit California employers
from attempting to influence their employees' political
activities and affiliations of discharge or loss of employment.
In <I>Gay Law Students Association v. Pacific Tel. & Tel.</i> (1979) 24
Cal.3d 458, the Supreme Court ruled that discrimination against
persons who identify themselves as gay or lesbian or as members
or participants in lesbian or gay organizations violates Labor
Code Sections 1101 and 1102. The Attorney General issued Opinion
No. 85-404 in 1986 in which he concluded that Labor Code
Sections 1101 and 1102 prohibit private employers from
discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or affiliation
(or even perceived sexual orientation or affiliation) regardless
of whether the protecendment Due Process guarantees, but left
open the question of whether discrimination against gay men and
lesbians violates the Equal Protection guarantees of the Fifth
and Fourteenth Amendments. <I>Bowers v. Hardwick</i>, 478 U.S. 186
(1986). and statutory proscrn and recommendations are designed to
help legal employers identify and examine obstacles impeding the
progress of gay men and lesbians in the legal workplace, and to
suggest concrete steps to attack the problem. Endorsement of the
Recommendations by the Bommittee's research and interviews,
supplemented by the experiences of many of its own members,
revealed a disturbing panoply of employer attitudes, policies and
practices which separately and in combination work to impede the
progress of gay and lesbian attorneys and employees. As
disturbing as any one experience may be in isolation, the
cumulative effect over time of repeated instances of
discrimination can seriously discourage lesbian and gay attorneys
from remaining with a particular employer or in a mainstream
legal environment at all.<p> 

<H4>Anti-Discrimination Policy</h4>

1. Many employers have failed to send a clear message to their
employees that manifestations of hostility and prejudice toward
gay men and lesbians will not be tolerated. The failure, for
example is condoned.<p>

Discrimination on the basis of HIV-status is prohibited by the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Pub.L. No. 101-336)
("ADA"), as well as the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1974 and a
host of state and local laws prohibiting discrimination on
account of handicap or disability. San Francisco Municipal Code
(Police), Article 38 Section 3803(a) forbids discrimination in
employment because "a person has AIDS or any of the associated
conditions covered by this Article." Section 3852(a) bans
discrimination in employment "as a result of the fact . . . that
a person has any disease or affliction that cannot be transmitted
by casual contact." Section 3802 specifically refers to
"individuals infected with the virus" as being victimized "due to
the nature of their infection." Model Employment Policies with
respect to AIDS and other HIV-related illnesses can be ordered
through the Management Information and Exchange. (See appended
Resources list).<p>

<H4>Recruitment and Hiring</h4>

2. Recruitment coordinators or hiring committee members may
screen out from the interviewing process law students whose
resumes reflect membership or leadership in gay/lesbian student,
legal or political organizations, while granting interviews to
similarly situated and qualified applicants who do not list such
affiliations.<p>

One recruiter from a major firm, for example, recently stated at
a recruitment professionals' conference that gay and lesbian
attorneys should "do their work" and "keep their mouths shut"
about their sexual orientation. Several others were vocally
hostile to the inclusion, on a National Association for Law
Placement questionnaire, of any inquiry into law firm practices
relating to openly gay and lesbian attorneys, despite strong
student support for inclusion of these questions.<p>

The bases for this exclusion may vary, but they often
include:<p><UL>

<LI>conscious discrimination based solely on the student's sexual
orientation;<p>

<LI>unconscious discomfort with the idea of employing openly gay
or lesbian employees;<p>

<LI>the assumption that the firm's clients may prefer not to be
represented by gay or lesbian attorneys and that such client
preferences should be honored;<p> 

<LI>the conscious or unconscious belief that the open listing of
such activities demonstrates "bad judgment" or that the weight
accorded leadership experience in gay/lesbian organizations is
not equal to that given analogous experience in other activist
organizations, such as BALSA, MALDEF, the women law students'
association, or the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund.</ul><p> 

Whatever the rationale, the result is the same -- the employer
has arbitrarily denied to the applicant the opportunity to pursue
a desirable position in his or her intended profession; other
members of the law firm are deprived of the opportunity to
explore the qualifications of an individual who might well be a
promising candidate; the firm's local and national reputation as
an employer may be damaged by these discriminatory employment
practices, discouraging highly qualified applicants, both
heterosexual individuals and lesbians and gay men, from applying
for positions. One Hastings law student, who happens to be
heterosexual, gained valuable litigation skills and substantive
expertise in constitutional law over the course of his summer
clerkship at National Gay Rights Advocates. When he listed this
experience on his resume, he was not granted a single interview,
but upon removing this legal experience from his resume, he
received multiple interviews and subsequent offers of employment.
Numerous lesbian and gay law students and attorneys have reported
similar experiences.] and, the firm will deprive itself of the
wide spectrum of perspectives and experiences conferred by a
culturally diverse workforce reflective of the client base and
the community it Serves.<p>

3. Law firm interviewers can make statements or pursue lines of
inquiry which have the intended or unintended effect of excluding
or alienating gay and lesbian applicants. Examples
include:<p><UL>

<LI>Statements which are openly hostile or which otherwise
clearly convey to the applicant a bigoted, fearful, or
discriminatory attitude toward gay men and lesbians. Hatred or
fear of lesbians and gay men is a tragic reality which continues
to be tolerated or even encouraged. It should come as no surprise
that there exist in the legal community those who share some of
these prejudices, animosities and misunderstandings. See, e.g.,
the recently reported statements of a United States District
Judge, making reference in open court to a group of inmates as "a
bunch of queers." The judge reportedly reaffirmed his earlier
remarks in interviews with the press, adding that he had drawn
reactions "from all over creation -- favorable mainly," and that
his comments reflected his dislike of homosexuals. San Francisco
Chronicle, July 18, 1991. p. 14. In one reported interview with a
promising Ivy League applicant, a partner in a major San
Francisco firm listed among the City's few disadvantages its "gay
community." The interviewee, in fact, was a lesbian whose
interest in bringing her talents to a San Francisco law firm was
largely motivated by the City's reputation for being open and
hospitable to gay men and lesbians. It is hard to imagine this
same interviewer feeling free to similarly disparage San
Francisco's Asian or Black community.<p>

<LI>Questions inquiring into the personal life of the applicant
which contain assumptions about sexual orientation. Female
applicants, for example, are frequently asked about "boyfriends"
and their views regarding "marriage and children;" male
applicants are asked about their "girlfriends" or their marital
status. These questions may evidence discrimination on the basis
of sexual orientation. They may also evidence discrimination on
other bases and should be avoided for those reasons as well. When
they are asked of women and not men, they may be perceived as
evidence of discrimination on the basis of gender. Even if there
is no apparent gender bias in the pattern of asking the
questions, they may be perceived as evidence of discrimination on
the basis of marital status. Discrimination in employment on the
basis of sex and marital status are prohibited by the Fair
Employment and Housing Act, California Government Code Sections
12940(a) and (c). See, "Right Questions, Wrong Questions," by
Jane Cooperman, National Law Journal, pp. 20, 22, July 31, 1989.
Many employers do not realize that questions of this nature
create a serious barrier to equal opportunity for lesbian and gay
applicants. Faced with questions of this nature, these applicants
are put on the spot, often feeling they must openly disclose or
actively conceal their sexual orientation. They frequently emerge
from the interview believing that only heterosexual relationships
are acceptable to the firm and the firm's culture.<p>

<LI>Avoidance of questions exploring the applicant's relevant
legal or community-based work with lesbian and gay-related
organizations listed on the applicant's resume. This may arise
from misplaced concern for the privacy of the applicant, despite
the fact that the applicant has volunteered this information or
may stem from the interviewer's personal discomfort with
homosexuality. Such behavior, presumably premised on the often
erroneous assumption that only lesbian or gay men participate in
groups dedicated to advancing the right to be free from
discrimination based on sexual orientation, serves as an
impediment to the ability of both gay and heterosexual
candidates' ability to elaborate easily on the skills and
experiences gained through such activities.</ul><p>

4. Aside from blatant instances of discrimination in the hiring
process, it is the finding of the Committee, based on the
available anecdotal evidence and the underrepresentation of gay
and lesbian attorneys in the partnership ranks, that law students
and attorneys who are known or thought to be gay or lesbian are
disproportionately refused employment by comparison to similarly
situated heterosexual candidates.<p>

<H4>Retention, Advancement and Compensation</h4>

5. Many firms have not taken the steps necessary to ensure a work
environment that is hospitable to gay men and lesbians. In many
legal workplaces, for example, attorneys and staff feel free to
refer to others as "fags" or "queers" and to make homophobic. In
the last two decades, the term homophobia has come to include any
bigoted, fearful, discriminatory, or violent reaction to
lesbians, gay men or bisexuals. [comments and jokes] In other
instances, staff or clients have refused to work with a gay man
or a lesbian employee. This problem is compounded by persistent
misconceptions held by many employees about HIV-infection and its
transmission.<p>

In addition to incurring possible legal liability for maintenance
of a discriminatorily hostile work environment, it is now
established law that racial and sexual harassment in the course
of employment is actionable as employment discrimination on the
basis of race and sex. <I>Patterson v. McLean Credit Union</i>,
491 U.S. 164 (1989); <I>Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson</i>,
477 U.S. 57, 65-68 (1986); <I>Ellison v. Brady</i>, 974 F.2d 872
(9th Cir. 1991); <I>E.E.O.C v. Hacienda Hotel</i>, 881 F.2d 1504,
1515 (9th Cir. 1989). By the same token, to the extent that
employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is
illegal (see pp. 3-4, supra), so is harassment in the workplace.
See <I>E.E.O.C. v. Hacienda Hotel</i>, <I>supra</i>, 881 F.2d at
1515, n. 8 (Liability attaches when the harassment is
sufficiently severe and pervasive as to create a hostile work
environment for its victim). It is easier to establish liability
against the employer in the racial context under the California
Fair Employment and Housing Act, which may be amended this year
to add sexual orientation as a prohibited basis for
discrimination and harassment (see p. 3, supra). California
Government Code, Section 1294, subsections (h) and (I). employers
who fail to make affirmative efforts to eliminate continuing
manifestations of prejudice against lesbians and gay men stand to
lose talented employees who are fearful of or offended by such a
charged and hostile environment. These employers additionally
forego the substantial investment made in the recruitment, hiring
and training of these employees and others who decline to remain
with an employer that does not encourage and nourish diversity in
the workplace. Both gay and heterosexual students from the
country's most well-regarded law schools are beginning to look to
a firm's handling of lesbian and gay employment issues as a key
"quality of life" indicator. See, e.g., Boalt Hall Fall 1991
Interview Program, Quality of Life Questionnaire; National
Association for Law Placement, 1990 Quality of Life
Questionnaire, "Draft #3;" Student comments at NALP Western
Regional meeting (Feb. 22, 1991).<p> 

6. Legal employers often insist that lesbian and gay attorneys
should separate their personal and professional lives in
situations in which heterosexual attorneys are expected to do the
opposite. This denies lesbian and gay attorneys opportunities to
develop and further their professional goals.<p>

An employer may view an employee's sexual orientation as a
personal attribute that is best kept secret, one that need never,
or should never, be made known to others in the firm. However,
this stymies participation in the informal networks of
communication within a firm which is critical to an attorney's
ultimate advancement and success. These networks normally involve
development of closer personal relationships and frequent
exchange of views by attorneys via informal lunches, golf and
other sporting events, dinners at other lawyers' homes, and other
social activities. On these occasions, as well as at more formal,
firm-sponsored events which attorneys are expected to attend,
discussions about family, friends and community activities are a
staple, and are part of the normal degree of collegiality
encouraged and expected by most employers. Lawyers additionally
are routinely urged or invited to bring their spouses or dates to
many of these events.<p>

Even a lawyer's office usually provides clear evidence of his or
her sexual orientation. Lawyers routinely display photographs of
their spouses or other loved ones on their desks and credenzas,
together with photos of their children, who are frequently posed
with the other parent; certificates awarded for charitable
service to community and political organizations often adorn
office walls. These common accoutrements of the professional
workplace are taken for granted, but only insofar as they reflect
a heterosexual personal life.<p> 

Under these circumstances, in firms where an employer has not
undertaken a process of firm-wide sensitization and education
regarding equal opportunity issues facing gay and lesbian
attorneys, these individuals often are effectively precluded from
full participation in the "networking" and routine social
interactions necessary to success in any firm. Lesbians and gay
men may even feel precluded from displaying in their own offices
pictures of same-sex partners or certificates of service to a
lesbian or gay organization.<p>

Apart from barriers to advancement, this pressure to hide some
significant portion of oneself from one's colleagues and friends
may cause anxiety and anger that will affect an attorney's
performance, creating an unconscionable burden for lesbian and
gay attorneys to carry.<p> 

Ultimately, where the leadership of the firm does not make it
clear that same-sex relationships and same-sex partners are of
equal value to the firm as their heterosexual counterparts,
lesbian and gay attorneys are impeded in their ability to
participate fully in the life of the firm, with the result that
many become increasingly non-productive, isolated and alienated,
causing them to leave, willingly or not.<p> 

7. Many employers have failed to establish, communicate, and
implement the use of, specific and objective criteria for the
evaluation of their attorneys' performance. Continuing reliance
by some firms on criteria such as "judgment," "maturity" and
other highly subjective measures, allows deeply-rooted biases and
prejudices to persist, excluding from advancement qualified gay
and lesbian employees. One firm, for example, criticized a summer
associate for introducing his same-sex partner to another
associate at a firm event, indicating that in the firm's view his
behavior reflected "a lack of judgment." The employer might
attempt to define the meaning of these and similar terms by
reference to the abilities and skills which the employer requires
for advancement, specifying that openness about one's sexual
orientation (for example, referring to one's domestic partner in
a context in which it would be appropriate to refer to one's
spouse, or discussing lesbian and gay-oriented community service)
is not to be deemed indicative of poor judgment or lack of
professional maturity.<p> 

8. Many employers continue to accede to their clients' actual or
assumed customer preference for a heterosexual lawyer. This
deprives lesbian and gay attorneys of the kind of client contact
that is so essential to advancement in the firm.<p>

In addition to potentially expensive and damaging issues of legal
liability which may arise. In the racial context, this practice
is facially violative of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, 42 U.S.C. Section 2000e, et seq. and analogous state and
local legislation. In the sex discrimination area, gender-based
customer preference has been held not to constitute a bona fide
occupational qualification (BFOQ) under Title VII and analogous
state and local legislation. Cf., <I>Diaz v. Pan American World
Airways. Inc.</i>, 442 F.2d 385 (5th Cir. 1971), <I>cert.
denied</i>, 404 U.S. 950 (1971). To the extent that
discrimination in employment on the basis of sexual orientation
is against the law (see pp. 3-4, supra), there is no BFOQ defense
and discrimination based on customer preference is facially
illegal, as it is in the racial context. Such conduct further
disserves the firm and its clients by depriving clients of the
full breadth of the firm's expertise. Moreover, the numbers of
lesbian and gay in-house counsel have grown across the nation, at
corporations ranging from Wells Fargo Bank, Bank of America,
Citibank, and McKesson to Blue Cross, Pacific Bell, Apple and The
Gap. As the sensitivity of these and other corporate clients has
grown in this regard, firms which affirmatively demonstrate
diversity among their attorneys by hiring and advancing gay and
lesbian attorneys, as well as those who are minority or women or
have a disability, stand to gain significant advantage in an
increasingly competitive environment.<p>

9. Many employers are unaware of the dates or meaning of
important celebrations and occasions reflective of lesbian or gay
culture, including the lesbian and gay civil rights movement.
Office retreats, for example, should not be held on dates which
conflict with the annual Lesbian/Gay Freedom Day Parade, held
nationally to commemorate the birth of that movement.<p>

10. Many employers have not reviewed their personnel and benefits
policies to ensure that lesbian and gay employees are treated
fairly and equitably. For example, although gay men and lesbian
are not legally pertained to marry their same-sex partners;
California law does not allow for same-sex marriage. California
Civil Code Section 4100. Hence, distinctions in employee benefits
based on marital status necessarily and adversely affect gay men
and lesbians in a way and to a degree beyond and worse than the
way they affect non-married heterosexuals, who have the right to
choose to marry. Most employers do not make affirmative provision
for relocation costs, caretaker and bereavement leave, or
parenting leave for non-marital partners on a basis equal to that
provided for marital partners. Additionally, most legal employers
provide health insurance coverage and survivor benefits for
attorneys' spouses and stepchildren but have not provided these
same benefits for the domestic partners. In this context, the
term "domestic partnership" refers to intimate committed
relationships between adults of any sexual orientation. However,
this term is also now a legal concept derived from newly enacted
local ordinances that may extend to unmarried partners employment
benefits previously reserved to married people. See San Francisco
Municipal Code (Administrative) Sections 62.1 to 62.8 of gay and
lesbian lawyers. See Recommendation 18 & n. 27 below for a brief
discussion of applicable tax and ERISA considerations. 
The differential provision of employee benefits operates to
deprive lesbian and gay employees of compensation equal to that
of their similarly situated heterosexual colleagues.<p>

Recommended Steps For Legal Employers To Achieve Equal Employment
Opportunity For Lesbian And Gay Attorneys And Law Students<p>

Being supportive of lesbians and gay men means creating the
opportunity for those who choose to be open with their sexual
orientation to do so without fear. It also requires respecting
the privacy of those who choose not to be open with their sexual
orientation.<p>

It is important to stress preliminarily that the choice to make
one's sexual orientation known is an intensely personal one for
each individual. It is not the purpose of these Recommendations
to encourage any employer to "bring out" an employee or applicant
against his or her will, and none of the recommendations that
follow will encourage, permit or cause this to happen. The term
"closeted" derives from a Victorian concept of the closet, in
which one put away the morally devalued characteristics of one's
life, including one's homosexuality. During the last half of this
century, the gay and lesbian rights movement has demanded the
right to bring homosexuality and bisexuality out of this closet,
a process called "coming out." When a third party discloses a
lesbian's or gay man's sexual orientation to someone who was not
previously aware of it, that third party "brings out" or "outs"
the lesbian or gay man.<p>

There are many reasons why lesbians and gay men may not be open
about their sexual orientation. Some lesbian and gay people
legitimately fear losing their families should their sexual
orientation become known. Some people have experienced serious
traumas that have left them fiercely protective of their privacy,
including involuntary discharge from the military and loss of a
child in a custody battle. The employer's duty is simply to make
the working environment one in which it is safe and comfortable
to be openly gay or lesbian should any employee so choose.<p> 

The Committee recognizes that legal employers vary considerably
in their structure, management, philosophy and culture, and that
the approaches and solutions adopted by a given employer may need
to be tailored to its unique characteristics. With this in mind,
every organization should scrutinize its own internal environment
and must devise an approach or solution that enables employees
who are openly lesbian or gay to participate fully in firm
functions and advancement of their professional careers on an
equal footing with heterosexual employees. However, the following
recommendations are believed to be realistic and achievable tools
that legal management should strongly consider implementing --
with skill and sensitivity -- in a greater effort to achieve the
goals of equality and workplace diversification.<p>

<H4>General Employment Policies And Practices</h4>

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 1</h4>

Management Commitment to Equality and Diversity: Legal employers must
make a commitment to the fair and equal recruitment, hiring, retention
advancement and compensation of gay and lesbian employees and
applicants. In order to effectively move the entire institution toward
adoption of these goals as important business and management objectives
the managing partner/chief counsel, or a formally and publicly
designated high-profile attorney with authority and clout, should assume
an active leadership role in the organization's efforts.<p> 

Employers with this policy: McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen.<br>
McCutchen's managing partner and Executive Committee are vocal in
support of diversity. The list of employers which follows each
recommended policy is not intended to be, and is not, an exhaustive list
of all firms with such policies, but rather those whose policies were
known to the Committee.<p>

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 2</h4>

Anti-discrimination and Equal Employment Opportunity Policies: Employers
should articulate, in all appropriate publications, policies and
procedures, the organization's commitment to and policy of equal
opportunity in employment, which should specifically prohibit
discrimination, including harassment, on the basis of sexual orientation
and marital status. The policy should include a statement that AIDS and
HIV-related conditions will be treated in the same manner as any other
disability protected by law.<p> 

Employers with this policy: Heller, Ehrman, White & McAuliffe.<br>

Heller, Ehrman has also adopted express goals and timetables for the
hiring and promotion of gay and lesbian attorneys. Lilienthal & Fowler;
Morrison & Foerster; Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe; Thelen, Marrin,
Johnson & Bridges.<p>

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 3</h4>

Training: Employers should conduct educational and training programs and
provide employees with written guidelines intended to educate all
employees, including non-lawyer staff, about sexual orientation issues,
including HIV-related issues. Human relations workshops, either led by
experienced outside consultants or by gay and lesbian attorneys or
others within the firm, and focused on issues affecting lesbian and gay
men as well as minorities, women and individuals with disabilities, can
serve as an ideal first step in such efforts. These workshops can result
in a frank exchange of views among employees, bringing to the attention
of heterosexual employees the everyday realities of law firm life as
experienced by gay and lesbian employees.<p> 

Employers with this policy: Heller, Ehrman, White & McAuliffe has
sponsored a number of education/training session on AIDS-related issues
during normal work hours; Lilienthal & Fowler; Morrison & Foerster.
Morrison pays overtime for the time spent by employees in attending
HIV-sensitivity training.<p>

<H4>Recruitment and Hiring</h4>

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 4</h4>

Representation on Hiring Committees: Employers should ensure that at
least one lesbian or gay attorney sits on the hiring committee. If an
employer wishes to place an openly lesbian or gay attorney on its hiring
committee, it can send a memo to all attorneys indicating its desire to
place such a person on the committee and asking that anyone interested
in this role contact the person in charge of hiring. The employer can
then make its selection from among the volunteers. This attorney can
review resumes that are submitted to ensure that openly lesbian and gay
candidates (and those whose resumes indicate that this may be the case)
are matched with lesbian and gay-sensitive attorneys in the course of
their call-back interviews, and are steered away from those who have
consistently manifested bias based on the sexual orientation of
applicants.<p> 

Active participation of openly lesbian or gay members in the recruitment
and hiring process can often change the dynamics of the committee,
educating and sensitizing the other members, confronting and challenging
overt or subtle bias on the part of committee colleagues when necessary,
and causing the committee as a whole to be more objective and fair in
its deliberations and decisions.<p> 

Employers with this policy: Heller, Ehrman, White & McAuliffe;
Lilienthal & Fowler.<p>

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 5</h4> 

Recruitment Letters: Employers should ensure that recruitment letters
are sent to law school lesbian and gay student organizations. These
letters should convey the employers commitment to workforce diversity,
including assurances that an applicant's sexual orientation, or openness
about his or her sexual orientation, will not adversely affect the
employment prospects of that individual.<p> 

Employers with this policy: Heller, Ehrman, White & McAuliffe;
Lilienthal & Fowler; McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen; Morrison &
Foerster; Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe.<p>

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 6</h4>

Gay-sensitive Contacts: Employers should identify and publicize the
names of lesbian and gay-sensitive contacts (ideally, at least one male
and one female) within the organization whom applicants can contact with
questions that they might not feel comfortable raising during an
interview. These individuals can be identified in recruitment literature
sent to lesbian and gay law student organizations, or in more generic
materials sent to placement offices. If there are currently no openly
gay or lesbian attorneys in the organization, a heterosexual attorney
who is sensitive to lesbian and gay issues should serve as the contact.
This person must be fully briefed on the employer's policies concerning
gay and lesbian issues, understanding that applicants must be given the
option of having these discussions kept confidential.<p> 

Employers with this policy: Heller, Ehrman, White & McAuliffe; Howard,
Rice, Nemerovski, Canady, Robertson & Falk; Morrison & Foerster;
McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen; Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe.<p> 

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 7</h4> 

Firm Resumes: Firm resumes and brochures that include reference to pro
bono activities should include lesbian or gay-related pro bono services
performed by members of the firm such as service on the AIDS Legal
Referral Panel. Similarly, service on the boards of lesbian, gay or
HIV-related community organizations should be highlighted along with the
firm's other community service activities.<p> 

Employers with this policy: Heller, Ehrman, White & McAuliffe; Howard,
Rice, Nemerovski, Canady, Robertson & Falk; Lilienthal & Fowler,
McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen; Morrison & Foerster<p> 

<h4>RECOMMENDATION 8</h4>

Specialized Training for All Interviewers: Training for interviewers
should include identification both of inappropriate areas of inquiry,
such as the candidate's sexual orientation (unless volunteered), marital
or relationship status or family plans. It should also emphasize
exploring appropriate areas of inquiry, such as lesbian and gay-oriented
activities or employment listed on the resume. It is important to note
that this is a sensitive area. Therefore, questions should be restricted
to activities and employment experiences that are disclosed, unless an
applicant volunteers information about his or her private life.<p>

Employers with this policy: McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen.<p>

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 9</h4>

Welcome Packets: If a "Welcome Packet" is given to new employees or
summer associates, the packet should include the firm's policy of
non-discrimination on the basis, inter alia, of sexual orientation,
marital status or HIV-status. It may also identify gay and lesbian
contacts within the firm. Community resources should include those
oriented toward the gay and lesbian communities. If a summer associate
or new employee has clearly identified herself or himself as lesbian or
gay, a publication such as the B.A.R., the Sentinel, and/or the Bay
Times can be included in the packet. If professional associations are
listed, lesbian and gay organizations such as BALIF and the Bar
Association's Committee on Lesbian and Gay Issues should be included.
Calendars of local events should contain the Lesbian/Gay Freedom Day
Parade, the San Francisco International Lesbian & Gay Film Festival, and
the AIDS Walk.<p>

Employers with this policy: McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen.<p>

<H4>Retention, Advancement and Compensation</h4>

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 10</h4>

Mentoring Program: Employers should provide their attorneys with formal
support structures, such as a mentoring program. The importance of the
assignment of an advisor or a mentor cannot be overemphasized. This is
especially the case for gay men and lesbians, women, minorities, and
individuals with disabilities, who have traditionally been excluded from
the informal networking process existing in the workplace. The mentor
can serve as a resource in numerous ways: as a teacher of the law and
lawyering; as a source of business opportunities and career- enhancing
work assignments; as a source of feedback and publicity for the newer
lawyers accomplishments; as a bridge/link for connecting to the
organization; as a troubleshooter, as a career counselor, as a source of
collegiality and friendship; and, as an advocate for the newer lawyer's
advancement and promotion.<p> 

The mentor should be a partner or comparable-level supervising attorney,
who may or may not be in a direct line supervisory relationship with the
new lawyer. It is important that the mentor have the necessary position
and authority, and the commitment, ability and sensitivity, to fulfill
the role effectively.<p>

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 11</h4>

Non-discrimination in Performance Evaluations, Work Assignment and
Grievance Procedures: An employer's anti-discrimination policy with
regard to sexual orientation is given life through its application to
exiting personnel. Employers should promote fairness and objectivity in
performance reviews by making special efforts to identify and overcome
subtle bias in the evaluation of gay and lesbian employees. Similarly,
presumed or actual client preference should play no role in the
assignment of work to gay and lesbian lawyers, just as racist or sexist
client biases are not honored. If an employer exhibits confidence in an
employee, the client is likely to do the same. Finally, to ensure that
homophobic hostility can be remedied when it arises, an employer should
provide employees with a neutral mechanism, independent of an immediate
supervisor, for discussion of perceived bias. This could take the form
of a general announcement of the ability to raise diversity-related
concerns to line management, mentors, or a designated representative or
committee, or by the employer's use of independent evaluators-separate,
from those actually providing the substantive evaluation -- who invite
response from the employee and are in a position to probe and challenge
evaluators as to their conclusions.<p> 

The difficult question may arise as to whether a partner/supervising
attorney/mentor should initiate a discussion with an openly gay or
lesbian lawyer concerning issues relating to sexual orientation if the
employee has not first raised them. Although some lawyers may regard
this as intrusive, there are many others who would prefer greater
management recognition of and sensitivity to their concerns, but who do
not wish to be perceived as malcontents with an "attitude problem."<p> 

If a manager does decide to inquire about the comfort level of an openly
gay or lesbian employees in the work environment, it should be done
privately on an individual basis. One opening might be, "We realize that
there are only a few openly gay or lesbian lawyers here and we recognize
the issues that may be posed by this. If there are any concerns you have
in that regard that you would like to discuss, please feel free to
discuss them with me or other designee."<p> 

Employers with this policy: Heller, Ehrman, White & McAuliffe;
Lilienthal & Fowler; McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen.<p>

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 12</h4>

Social Function Policy: Employers should establish a policy,
communicated in personnel manuals and orientation meetings, stating that
invitations to office functions or other employer- sponsored events
should use neutral designations such as "guest" rather than "spouse."<p> 

Employers with this policy: Lilienthal & Fowler; McCutchen, Doyle, Brown
& Enersen; Morrison & Foerster. <p>

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 13 </h4>

"Spouse" Lists: Employers should list the domestic partners of lesbian
and gay employees who so desire in the same manner that the spouses of
heterosexual employees are listed, for example in "spouse" lists or
"face books" distributed either in-house or to applicants and clients.<p> 

Employers with this policy: Heller, Ehrman, White & McAuliffe; Howard,
Rice, Nemerovski, Canady, Robertson & Falk; McCutchen, Doyle, Brown &
Enersen; Morrison & Foerster; Thelen, Marrin, Johnson & Bridges.<p> 

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 14</h4>

Professional Associations: Employers should pay employees' membership
dues to lesbian and gay professional associations, such as BALIF, on the
same basis as the employer pays for memberships in other professional
associations. Employees' activities in lesbian and gay professional
associations should be supported on the same basis as activities in
other professional associations, such as table sponsorship at annual
dinners and fundraising events.<p> 

Employers with this policy: Heller, Ehrman, White & McAuliffe; Howard,
Rice, Nemerovski, Canady, Robertson & Falk; McCutchen, Doyle, Brown &
Enersen; Morrison & Foerster; Thelen, Marrin, Johnson & Bridges.<p> 

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 15</h4>

Internal Newsletters: If the employer has an internal newsletter, it
should periodically include items of particular interest to lesbian and
gay employees. Internal newsletters may also be used to help educate
heterosexual employees about issues affecting lesbians and gay men.
Additionally, newsletters should report the achievements of those who
work within the lesbian and gay community.<p>

Employers with this policy: Heller, Ehrman, White & McAuliffe;
McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen; Morrison & Foerster.<p>

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 16</H4>

Informal Exchanges: Employers should foster opportunities for gay and
lesbian attorneys to support each other in the work environment. For
instance, an employer may sponsor a periodic luncheon, dinner or other
appropriate social event for lesbian and gay employees. Events should
also be sponsored for lesbian and gay employees that include
heterosexual employees, to build mutual understanding and respect.<p> 

Employers with this policy: McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen; Morrison
& Foerster.<p>

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 17<h4>

Lunch Programs: Employers who sponsor regular firm lunches focusing on
legal issues of interest to their attorneys should include programs on
lesbian and gay legal issues, pro bono opportunities with local lesbian
and gay rights groups, or the work of local lesbian and gay professional
associations. The employer may contact such organizations as BALIF, the
National Center for Lesbian Rights, the AIDS Legal Referral Panel,
Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Committee on Lesbian and
Gay Issues of the Bar Association of San Francisco, or the Gay Rights
Chapter of the ACLU of Northern California to provide guest speakers for
such programs.<p>

Employers with this policy: McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen.<p>

<H4>Employee Benefits</h4>

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 18</h4>

Health Benefits: Employers should offer health benefits to the domestic
partners or lesbian and gay employees, to the extent possible under the
federal tax law rules, on the same terms that they are available to the
spouses of heterosexual employees. Employers should seek the admission
of domestic partners to a covered group, with the cost of coverage to be
paid on an after-tax basis. If an employer is unable to obtain such
coverage, it can pay the premium for outside individual insurance for
domestic partners, though this usually costs more, covers less, and
excludes more pre-existing conditions. Since the value of this benefit
is not a non-taxable employee benefit under ERISA, and, therefore,
taxable income to the employee, the employer should additionally pay the
employee a dollar amount equal, after taxes, to the income tax liability
for the benefit. Employers are advised to seek the advice of tax counsel
in promulgating their policies in this area. Children of lesbian and gay
couples should also be eligible for coverage on the same basis as the
biological children, adopted children and stepchildren of married
employees. See the appended Resources list for further information on
domestic partner health benefits.<p> 

Employers with this policy: ACLU of Northern California; City of
Berkeley; City and County of San Francisco; Lilienthal & Fowler.<p>

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 19</h4>

Parenting Leave: Employers should ensure that all parenting leave
policies and part-time policies accommodating parenting are
gender-neutral and are not dependent on the biological relationship
between the parent and the child. The children of lesbians and gay men
may be adopted, foster children, the product of donor insemination, or
the children of an earlier marriage of one of the parents. It may be
that neither parent has a biological relationship to the child, or that
a parent without a biological tie is taking primary caretaking
responsibility for the child. This will ensure that the families of
lesbian and gay employees, which may include children legally adopted
only by the employee's partner, including those where a primary
caregiver is not the biological parent, are treated in the same manner
as are the families of heterosexual employees.<p> 

Employers with this policy: Heller, Ehrman, White & McAuliffe;
Lilienthal & Fowler; McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen; Orrick,
Herrington & Sutcliffe; Rogers, Joseph, O'Donnell & Quinn.<p> 

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 20</h4>
 
Child Care: Where child care is provided to employees, it should be made
available to employees' non-biological children.<p> 

Employers with this policy: Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe (Orrick has
on-site emergency child care available to children of employees).<p>

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 21</h4>

Care-Taking Policies and Bereavement Leave: Caretaking leave policies
should allow leave time to be taken for the care of domestic partners
and non- biological children. Employers should also provide leave time
for the death of a domestic partner or immediate relative of such a
partner on the same terms that they provide leave time for the death of
a spouse or immediate relative of a spouse.<p>

Employers with this policy: Landels, Ripley & Diamond; Lilienthal &
Fowler, McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen; Morrison & Foerster; City and
County of San Francisco.<p>

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 22</h4>

Relocation Benefits: Employers should reimburse new employees for the
cost of relocating the employees domestic partner to the Bay Area from
other parts of the country on the same terms as are expenses of an
employee's spouse. One nondiscriminatory approach used by a growing
number of legal employers, is to distribute to all employees who
relocate a lump sum for relocation, with no restriction as to whom the
allowance may be applied.<p> 

Employers with this policy: Howard, Rice, Nemerovski, Canady, Robertson
& Falk; McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen; Orrick, Herrington &
Sutcliffe.<p> 

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 23</h4>

Employee Assistance Programs: It the employer has an Employee Assistance
Program through which various benefits are made available to employees
and their families, including drug and alcohol counseling or crisis
counseling such as that provided by many employers in the wake of the
1989 earthquake, the definition of "family" for such benefits should
include domestic partners and non-biological children.<p> 

Employers with this policy: Morrison & Foerster.<p>

<H2>Electronic Media and Services: Scope of Use</h2>

<H2>The Ultimate Employee Handbook -- A Workshop</h2>

<H3>Workshop Library File</h3>

Contributor: Margaret Phillips<br>
Company: DHL SYSTEMS, INC.<br>

Telephone: 415-375-5367<br>

<H3>Electronic Media and Services: Scope of Use</h3>

POLICY NO.  233<p>

Effective Date: August 4, 1995<p>

1.0  BASIC POLICY<p>

1.1 As an advanced technology company, we increasingly use and
exploit electronic forms of communication and information
exchange. Employees have access to one or more forms of
electronic media and services (computers, e-mail, telephones,
voicemail, fax machines, external electronic bulletin boards,
wire services, on-line services, the Internet and the World Wide
Web).<p> 

1.2 The company encourages the use of these media and associated
services because information technology is our business, because
they make communication more efficient and effective, and because
they are valuable sources of information, e.g., about vendors,
customers, new products and services. However, electronic media
and services provided by the company are company property, and
their purpose is to facilitate company business.<p> 

1.3 With the rapidly changing nature of electronic media, and the
"netiquette" which is developing among users of external on-line
services and the Internet, this policy cannot lay down rules to
cover every possible situation. Instead, it expresses the
company's philosophy and sets forth general principles to be
applied to use of electronic media and services.<p> 

1.4 The following procedures apply to all electronic media and
services which are:<p><UL> 

<LI>accessed on or from company premises,<p>

<LI>accessed using company computer equipment, or via
company-paid access methods, and/or<p> 

<LI>used in a manner which identifies the individual with the
company.</ul><p> 

2.0  PROCEDURES<p>

2.1 Electronic media may not be used for knowingly transmitting,
retrieving or storage of any communications of a discriminatory
or harassing nature, or which are derogatory to any individual or
group, or which are obscene or X-rated communications, or are of
a defamatory or threatening nature, or for "chain letters," or
for any other purpose which is illegal or against company policy
or contrary to the company's interest.<p> 

2.2 Electronic media and services are primarily for company
business use. Limited, occasional or incidental use of electronic
media (sending or receiving) for personal, non-business purposes
is understandable and acceptable -- as is the case with personal
phone calls. However, employees need to demonstrate a sense of
responsibility and may not abuse the privilege.<p> 

2.3 Electronic information created and/or communicated by an
employee using e-mail, word processing, utility programs,
spreadsheets, voicemail, telephones, Internet/BBS access, etc.
will not generally be monitored by the company, and we respect
our employees' wish to work without "Big Brother" looking over
their shoulder. However, the following conditions should be
noted:<p> 

2.3.1 The company routinely monitors usage patterns for both
voice and data communications (e.g., number called or site
accessed; call length; times of day calls). Reasons include cost
analysis/allocation and the management of our gateway to the
Internet.<p> 

2.3.2 The company also reserves the right, in its discretion, to
review any employee's electronic files and messages and usage to
the extent necessary to ensure that electronic media and services
are being used in compliance with the law and with this and other
company policies.<p> 

2.3.3 Employees should therefore not assume electronic
communications are totally private and confidential and should
transmit highly sensitive information in other ways.<p> 

2.4 Employees must respect the confidentiality of other people's
electronic communications and may not attempt to read, "hack"
into other systems or other people's logins, or "crack"
passwords, or breach computer or network security measures, or
monitor electronic files or communications of other employees or
third parties except by explicit direction of company management
per section 2.3.<p> 

2.5 Each employee who uses any security measures on a
company-supplied PC or MAC must provide his/her group
administrative assistant with a sealed hard copy record (to be
retained in a secure location) of all of his/her PC or MAC
passwords and encryption keys (if any) for company use if
required. (Example: there may be a need for the company to access
an employee's system or files when s/he is away from the office).
There is no need to provide UNIX passwords since the UNIX system
administrator can access all e-mail and files via "root"
passwords if necessary.<p> 

2.6 No e-mail or other electronic communications may be sent
which attempt to hide the identify of the sender, or represent
the sender as someone else or from another company.<p> 

2.7 Electronic media and services should not be used in a manner
that is likely to cause network congestion or significantly
hamper the ability of other people to access and use the system.<p> 

2.8 Anyone obtaining electronic access to other companies' or
individuals' materials must respect all copyrights and may not
copy, retrieve, modify or forward copyrighted materials except as
permitted by the copyright owner or a single copy for reference
use only.<p> 

2.9 Any messages or information sent by an employee to one or
more individuals via an electronic network (e.g., bulletin board,
on-line service, or Internet) are statements identifiable and
attributable to our company. While some users include personal
"disclaimers" in electronic messages, it should be noted that
there would still be a connection with the company, and the
statement might still be legally imputed to the company. All
communications sent by employees via a network must comply with
this and other company policies, and may not disclose any
confidential or proprietary company information.<p> 

2.10 Network services and World Wide Web sites can and do monitor
access and usage and can identify at least which company -- and
often which specific individual -- is accessing their services.
Thus accessing a particular bulletin board or Website leaves
company-identifiable electronic "tracks" even if the employee
merely reviews or downloads the material and does not post any
message.<p> 

2.6 The company makes available to employees a service for
posting internal personal announcements to other company
employees. All such internal electronic personal announcements
must go through this Human Resources service.<p> 

2.7 Any employee found to be abusing the privilege of
company-facilitated access to electronic media or services will
be subject to corrective action and/or risk having the privilege
removed for him/herself and possibly other employees.<p>

* * * * * <p>

<H3>Corporate Electronic Mail Policy Statement and Instruction</h3>

<H4>Note: This document is part of your employee handbook effective
immediately.</h4>

1.  Purpose.<p>

1.1  General.<p>

The Company provides electronic mail to employees at Company
expense for their use in performing their duties for the Company.
This instruction sets forth the Company's Instruction on proper
use of this Electronic Mail ("E-mail") system. It also sets forth
the Company's policy regarding under what circumstances E-mail
messages addressed to one person may be accessed by other people
within the Company and when they may be disclosed to outsiders.<p> 

The Company reserves the right to change these policies at any
time, with such notice as the Company deems appropriate.<p> 

2.  Background.<p>

2.1  Benefits of E-mail.<p>

An E-mail system provides many benefits to the Company and to
you. E-mail communications often improve relationships between
different operating groups, facilitating smooth conduct of
business.<p> 

2.2  How E-mail Works.<p>

All E-mail messages are stored in a database on a network file
server. There is no limit on the number of messages that a user
can have. All unread message titles are indexed in the user's
"inbox". The user has the option of leaving read messages indexed
in their "inbox" or organizing them into "folders". A user can
also "archive" a message to their hard disk or diskette, or
delete the message from the system. Only deleted and archived
messages are removed from the E-mail database. Retaining a large
number of messages can slow down the operation of the e-mail
system significantly.<p> 

2.3 Please Note: Users often use E-mail for less formal
correspondence.<p> 

We are aware that other companies have experience with employees
allowing this informality to degenerate into improper use. Some
have experience with personnel using E-mail to make derogatory
comments about others, violate policy, or even to commit crimes.
Because the E-mail system often feels like a less formal method
of communication than paper, and it is not a face-to-face mode of
communication, users may feel free to be less cautious or more
candid in the contents of messages. Please remember, however,
that the E-mail system is not a private mode of communication,
and defamatory material distributed through the E-mail system
could expose the user to liability as well as disciplinary
action.<p>

Accordingly, the E-mail system should not be used to send jokes
or other comments that may be discriminatory, harassing or
offensive to others, or to send material that defames an
individual, company or business or discloses personal information
without authorization.<p> 

2.4  Access to E-mail.<p>

In formulating this instruction, the Company asks our employees
keep in mind that when you are using E-mail you are creating
Company documents using a Company asset. These documents, like
the purchase orders, correspondence and other documents you
create while performing your job, are not private and may be read
by others at the Company or outside the Company under the
appropriate circumstances. The Company wants to make all
employees aware of the fact that there may be many instances
where such messages may be read by others, as further described
below. Additionally, employees should be aware that even though a
message may be deleted from the E-mail system, a record of it may
remain on the computer system either on the daily backups of all
data or in other ways. The Company asks that all employees keep
these guidelines in mind, and exercise the appropriate discretion
in using the Electronic Mail system.<p>

3. Statement of Policy.<p>

3.1.  Policy.<p>

It is Company Policy that the E-mail system, like other Company
assets such as the voice mail system, be used solely for the
benefit of the Company. Use of the E-mail system to violate other
Company policies is prohibited and may lead to disciplinary
action, up to and including termination.<p> 

3.2 Employees should be aware that E-mail messages, like Company
correspondence, may be read by other Company employees or
outsiders under certain circumstances, similar to the
circumstances under which the Company may need to access your
other business files and information. While it is impossible to
list all of the circumstances, some examples are the
following:<p>

3.2.1 During regular maintenance of the E-mail system.<p>

3.2.2 When the Company has a business need to access the
employee's mail box. For example, if an employee is absent from
the office and their supervisor has reason to believe that
information relevant to the day's business is located in the
employee's electronic mail box.<p> 

3.2.3 The Company receives a legal request to disclose E-mail
messages from law enforcement officials or in ongoing legal
proceedings.<p> 

3.2.4 The Company has reason to believe that the employee is
using E-mail in violation of Company policies. Such policies
include, but are not limited to, the policy against illegal and
unauthorized copying of software.<p> 

3.3 Personal Use. Should employees make incidental use of the
E-mail system to transmit personal messages, such messages will
be treated no differently than other messages, and may be
accessed, reviewed, copied, deleted or disclosed. Accordingly,
when sending a message, always remember that the E-mail system is
not a private communication system (even though passwords are
used for security reasons), and you should not expect that a
message will never be disclosed to or read by others beyond its
original intended recipients. The E-mail system is not intended
to be used as a personal bulletin service. Solicitations, offers
to buy and sell goods or services and other personal messages to
large groups via the E-mail system are subject to the same rules
your local facility imposes for such messages on bulletin boards
and may be prohibited.<p> 

4. Confidential Information.<p>

4.1 Business Information. Company policy requires that all
employees protect the integrity of the Company's proprietary and
confidential information as well as the proprietary and
confidential information of others. Employees must exercise a
greater degree of caution in transmitting Company trade secrets
or other confidential information on the E-mail system than with
other communication means because of the reduced effort required
to redistribute such information. Company trade secrets or
confidential information should never be transmitted or forwarded
to outside individuals or companies not authorized to receive
that information, and should not even be sent or forwarded to
other employees inside the Company who do not have a need to know
the information. To reduce the chance that trade secrets or
confidential information may inadvertently be sent to outsiders
or the wrong person inside the Company, please minimize the use
of distribution lists when sending such information (and make
sure that any lists used are current) and review each name on any
list of recipients before sending to ensure that all recipients
have a need to know the information.<p> 

E-mail messages that contain trade secrets or other confidential
information should have a confidentiality legend in all capital
letters at the top of the message in a form similar to the
following:<p> 

<STRONG>THIS MESSAGE CONTAINS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND TRADE
SECRETS OF [insert name of your company] , Inc.<BR>
UNAUTHORIZED USE OR DISCLOSURE PROHIBITED.</strong><p>

Since copies of E-mail may be placed on back-up or other systems
you do not control, and may be under certain circumstances be
accessed by MIS personnel or others without a need to know the
information, you should keep in mind that E-mail may be
inappropriate to communicate certain types of confidential
information.<p>

In addition, to minimize inadvertent disclosures, employees
should not access their E-mail messages for the first time in the
presence of others. Messages containing Company trade secrets or
confidential information should not be left visible on the
monitor when a user is away from his or her computer. E-mail
passwords should be routinely changed at least monthly.<p> 

4.2 Copyright Infringement. The ability to attach a document to
an E-mail message for distribution greatly enhances the risk of
copyright infringement. A user can be liable for the unauthorized
copying and distribution of copyrighted material through E-mail
system. Accordingly, you should not copy and distribute through
the E-mail system any copyrighted material of a third party (such
as software, database files, documentation, articles, graphics
files and down-loaded information) unless you have confirmed in
advance from appropriate sources that the Company has the right
to copy or distribute such material. Any questions concerning
these rights should be directed to the [insert name of corporate
counsel].<p> 

4.3 Messages to Counsel. All messages to and from counsel (both
in-house and outside counsel) seeking or giving legal advice
should be marked with the following legend in all capital letters
at the top of the message:<p> 

<STRONG>CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY/CLIENT PRIVILEGED
COMMUNICATION</strong><p>

In addition, in order to preserve the attorney-client privilege,
messages to counsel should never be sent to a distribution list,
should never be forwarded to anyone else, and should never be
retained on the E-mail system. If a copy of an attorney-client
privileged communication needs to be retained, it should be
printed and filed in the appropriate file.<p> 

5. Electronic Mail Messages to Japan or other countries [this is
an optional clause if you have operations outside of Hawaii in
foreign jurisdictions]<p> 

5.1 At the time this instruction was drafted, many personnel at
the Headquarters office of [insert name of your company], were
connected to the E-mail system, and plans indicate that many
other locations worldwide will be connected over the next few
years. We wish to take this opportunity to remind all employees
that an E-mail message to locations outside the United States is
considered an export by the United States Department of Commerce,
Bureau of Export Administration, and we refer you to [insert name
of your company] Corporate Policy on Export Control Regulations.
The same rules that apply to any other export apply to E-mail
messages. Therefore, if you are required to obtain a export
license to send a software program, drawings or technical data on
diskette to Japan, you must follow these same requirements to
export such data on the E-mail system. Please contact the
Import/Export Department if you have any questions regarding this
matter. <p>

6. Management of Electronic Mail System<p>

6.1 Deletion of messages. The Company strongly discourages the
storage of large numbers of e-mail messages. Retention of
messages fills up large amounts of storage space on the network
server, and can also slow down performance. In addition, because
E-mail messages can contain Company confidential information, it
is desirable to limit the number, distribution and availability
of such messages.<p> 

6.2 Deletion by users. As a general rule, if a message does not
require specific action or response on your part, you should
delete it promptly after reading it. If the content of the
message needs to be saved for longer than a week, it should be
placed in a folder, archived to a local hard disk or diskette or
printed out and saved in the appropriate file. Please review your
messages every week and delete those that are not needed.<p> 

6.3 Deletion by E-mail administrator. In addition, the E-mail
administrator should enforce the following retention rules:<p><UL> 

<LI>All read inbox messages will automatically be deleted after
30 days.<p>

<LI>All message log (retains copy of sent messages) entries will
be deleted after 30 days.<p> 

<LI>All private folder messages will be deleted after 180
days.<p>

<LI>All bulletin board messages will be deleted when they are no
longer required or appropriate.<p> 

<LI>Any messages requiring longer retention must be archived from
the E-mail database by the individual user.<p>

7. Customer Access to Electronic Mail System.<p> 

7.1 In appropriate instances, the Company will allow its E-mail
system to be used by customers, suppliers and other business
partners. Such access will be contingent upon agreement to all
applicable rules for use. In the event that one of the Company's
customers, suppliers or business partners wishes to access the
Company's E-mail system, please contact the MIS Group.<p>

<H3>Smoking Policy</h3>

To:  All Employees Who Smoke<p>

Re:  Smoking During Working Hours<p>

We need your cooperation in a delicate matter: Restricting
the
amount you smoke while youre at work.<p>

None of your supervisors wants to get into the business of
closely regulating your time at work. We want to retain an
informal management style, and we dont want to impose
formal
break times, except in the strictest production settings.
But
its clear that smoking is getting out of hand, and people
are
spending ridiculous amounts of time standing around out-side
sucking nicotine. Somebody who has a half-dozen cigarettes
during
work very likely spends close to an hour a day -- or more --
hanging out.<p>

Let me be clear: We dont want you to smoke at all. It will
make
you sick. It will bring pain to the people who care most
about
you. It also drives up the cost of health insurance benefits
for
the rest of us. (Let me remind you well happily reimburse
the
tuition paid by any smoker who completes a smoke-ending
program
and remains smoke-free for a year.)<p>

We sure dont want to encourage smoking by granting smokers
paid
time off that non-smokers dont get.<p>

So were asking you to confine your smoking to what were
told is
a standard: A break in the morning and a break in the
afternoon.
Please arrange the timing of those breaks with your
supervisor.
Were leaving this up to you, for now.<p>

One more thing: This is a smoke-free environment. You may
not
smoke anywhere in this building at any time. Thats no joke.
We
have many things in our buildings, chemicals and paper for
starters, that burn very well. Smoking in this building is
grounds for immediate dismissal.<p>

<H2>Guidelines for Editorial Employees - American Lawyer
Media, L.P. </h2>

<H2>The Ultimate Employee Handbook -- A Workshop</h2>

<H3>Workshop Library File</h3>

<H4>Contributor: Cloyd Laporte III<br>

Source: Counsel Connect<br>
Address: 600 Third Ave., 2nd Floor, New York, NY  10016<br>
Telephone: (800) 455-4354<br>

HREF="mailto:claporte@counsel.com">E-mail:claporte@counsel.com</a></h4><p>

<H3>Guidelines for Editorial Employees</h3>

1. CORRECTIONS<p>

a) Do it prominently: It is our policy to publish
corrections as
soon as possible in a way that is at least as prominent as
the
original mistake. Thus, if we make a mistake on page one,
the
correction should run on page one, in type as large or
larger
than the mistake. Remember, the goal is to make the
correction at
least as prominent as the error.<p>

b) Come clean: A correction should never be coated in
euphemisms
such as "clarification." When we make a mistake, we should
say so
candidly.<p>

2. HANDLING COMPLAINTS<p>

When a reader or the subject of an article complains that
something is inaccurate or unfair, the highest editorial
person
on the scene should be made aware of it immediately.<p>

Although complaints are handled by the editors of each
publication, tear sheets of all corrections, no matter how
trivial, are sent to Steve Brill.<p>

3. SOURCING<p>

a) Know the ground rules: All reporters are obligated to be
thoroughly familiar with the vocabulary of reporting ground
rules. To avoid confusion and because usage varies, we'll
repeat
the basics here.<p>

"Off the record" means your source never told you the
information
and you can't use it in your story. Of course, a good
reporter
can usually get the story from other sources once he or she
knows
it's there to get.<p>

"On background" means that you can act on the information
without
attributing it to your source personally or to sources at
his or
her firm. You can use the information, you just can't
attribute
it.<p>

"Not for attribution" means that the source will be
identified in
a general way. Be careful here: You want to give the reader
as
much information as possible about your source's credibility
(or
lack of credibility). But you don't want to give away so
much
that a careful reader can identify the source.<p>

"A partner at Smith, James who worked on the case" is better
than
"a Smith, James lawyer" but if only one partner is working
on the
matter, you've screwed your source.<p>

Always push people to be on the record. Remind them that
readers
put more stock in an attributed quote. If you must, allow
them to
go "not for attribution," then, if that fails, "on
background,"
and if all else fails, "off the record." But remember that
"off
the record" pretty much means you can't use it in your story
at
all unless confirmed independently.<p>

b) Be Explicit: All reporters should try to use the most
explicit
sourcing possible. NEVER USE "SOURCES SAID." The words
"sources
say" or "a source said" mean nothing to a reader and should
never
appear in our journalism. Always tell the reader how many
sources, precisely. And, to the extent possible, tell what
kinds
of sources: Your doorman? Or a top lawyer working on the
case?<p>

Some reporters think "sources say" is a figure of speech,
meaning
one source told them something. To us, it means more than
one,
and readers want to know how many more. So say five
litigators,
or two dozen associates, or whatever. Similarly, don't use
"more
than" if you can be more specific. Precision adds more to
your
credibility than a vague allusion to larger numbers.<p>

If a source insists that he not be described in any way at
all,
then you really can't cite the source. You can't say "a
source
said" or anything equivalent to that.<p>

c) Tell About a Source's Weakness: If your anonymous (or
named)
source clearly has an ax to grind, tell your readers.<p>

An example: "says a lawyer involved in the Texaco/Pennzoil
case"
is not as good as "says a lawyer on the Texaco side."<p>

Another example: "says someone who knows Smith well" is not
as
good as "says someone who claims to know Smith well, but who
left
his employ after a falling out." Our goal is to tell our
readers
what we know and convey our impression of the information,
not to
sell our readers something we don't buy or of which we're
wary.<p>


4. GETTING FAIR COMMENT<p>

In this company, the single worst thing a reporter can do is
to
attribute an act or thought to someone without getting that
person's specific comment about whether that act or thought
happened.<p>

To take a seemingly simple example, suppose you're writing a
profile of Smith and you interview his college roommate,
Jones.
If Jones says the two of them used to wake up at 4:30 to
study,
ask Smith. Similarly, if Smith says that he and Jones were
arrested at college for indecent exposure, ask Jones.<p>

If Smith (the subject of the profile) says, "Business is
full of
tough decisions, but you have to make them. A year ago I
even had
to fire my college roommate, Jim Jones," you'd better ask
Jones
about that.<p>

This is necessary both for fairness and for accuracy.<p>

What if Jones is unavailable for comment? Make sure you
leave an
explicit message about what you want to ask and that you
make a
note of who took the message and the time of the call. This
is
not so much for legal protection as to ensure that you work
in a
way that produces careful, accurate reporting and which will
enable you to write a snappy reply when Jones writes a
letter
complaining about how stupid and unfair you are.<P>

If all efforts to obtain fair comment have been exhausted,
remember that you may and should incorporate any statement
the
person has previously made on the point. You should also
seek to
obtain his side by calling his lawyer or a friend, associate
or
anyone else who can knowledgeably describe the person's
point of
view on the subject.<p>

No one we write about should ever be surprised about what we
say
because we will have either asked him about it or left an
explicit message that we want to ask him about it.<p>

For those with daily deadlines, if you can't leave an
explicit
message that someone can be reasonably expected to receive
in
time to respond to you, and if the information you are about
to
write is negative, then hold the story for a day. In other
words,
either we sacrifice a scoop or you do a better job at
leaving
effective messages. We don't sacrifice fairness or
accuracy.<p>

When in doubt about any of this, call Steve Brill.<p>

5. QUOTES<p>

a) No Embellishment: Quotes are never to be embellished.
They
should never be taken out of context. A good test of whether
they're taken in context is for you to assume the person
you're
quoting has secretly recorded the interview, and he can
produce
that recording for your editor and your readers to judge how
fair
you've been.<p>

If a spokesman for Jones says he is speaking for Jones, you
still
must attribute it to "Smith, a spokesman for Jones," not
Jones.<p>

b) Label All Quotes: Don't say: Smith's firm is "the most
congenial place" he's ever been associated with. Say: Smith
says
his firm is "the most congenial place" he's ever been
associated
with. Or: To Smith, Jones, Day is "the most congenial place"
he's
ever been associated with.<p>
 
c) Be Careful of Blind Quotes: It's unfair to have your most
negative quote about someone be anonymous. Don't do it.<p>

d) Be Careful of Deals: You should try never to make a deal
with
someone to read his quotes back to him before you publish
them.
People will always want to change their quotes. But
remember, no
one has to talk to you, and this is sometimes the only way
to get
someone on the record. What you sometimes can do is tell
someone
who insists on not being quoted at all that what he's saying
is
for background only unless you decide he's said something so
important that you want to come back to him for approval, at
which point it can go on the record if he agrees to it.
That's a
deal to read back quotes, but it's one that's been made only
with
someone who really wasn't going to be quoted at all.<p>

Generally, you are free to make deals with a source but with
two
caveats: (1) you must keep to them, and (2) you can never
make a
deal to let anyone see a draft or part of a draft in
advance.<p>

Don't make deals that restrict your ability to do other
reporting. It's one thing to promise you won't use what a
source
tells you, but don't promise that you won't make calls or
won't
use the information under any circumstances. What if someone
else
tells all?<p>

e) Give Credit for Old Quotes: If you are quoting someone
from
what he said to another reporter in another article, be sure
to
say where the quote is coming from. And be explicit. Don't
just
say: "'I own the world', he was quoted as saying." Say: "'I
own
the world,' he told The New York Times last year."<p>

6. GIVING CREDIT<p>

All of us hate it when larger publications steal from us.
The
answer isn't to do the same, but to show the way. Bend over
backwards to give credit for things reported first
elsewhere,
especially if the credit belongs to a competitor. Not only
is
this the right thing to do; it also demonstrates to readers
how
much class we have and how secure we are about how good we
are.
When in doubt, give credit.<p>

7. HONESTY IN REPORTING<p>

Some narrowly defined deceptions in reporting are perfectly
acceptable. For example, it's perfectly appropriate for a
consumer reporter to take his car to eight repair shops when
he
knows it's in perfect shape, just to see what each mechanic
will
say. Similarly, it's fine for a restaurant reviewer to make
reservations under a phony name in order to pose as a
typical
customer. But most other deceptions are unacceptable and all
proposals for deceptions should be cleared with the editor
in
advance.<p>

Most areas are not at all gray. For example, in the normal
course
of things, a reporter should always identify himself as
such.
(Don't just walk up to a juror after the verdict and ask
what the
deliberations were like without identifying yourself.)<p>

Other things that are not allowed at all:<p>

a) Tape recording any conversation, by telephone or in
person,
unless all parties to the conversation are aware of the
taping
and have given their consent.<p>

b) Taking without authorization documents or anything else
in the
course of reporting, no matter how important the documents
may
be. This is known as stealing.<p>

c) Reading documents (upside down or otherwise) on someone's
desk
during an interview without being invited to do so. This is
dishonest.<p>

d) Calling jurors while they are deliberating or sequestered
or
during the course of a trial.<p>

8. COURTESY<p>

You're a professional, and you need to act like one. The
First
Amendment doesn't give you a right to be angry when people
won't
cooperate with you. They don't have to, and we all know that
in
many instances they have to be crazy or stupid to cooperate,
which, happily, they often are.<p>

While we're on the subject, don't be offended if the person
you're interviewing wants to record the interview or have
someone
else with him. He's being smart, and/or he's been burned by
a bad
reporter before. (It happens, you know.)<p>

9. LAWSUITS<p>

Lawsuits will sometimes come with good reporting. We will
fight
them vigorously when we think we're right; in fact, we'll
usually
sue for our costs. But for us to be effective we need to
know
immediately when someone has threatened you. Tell your
editor
when someone starts talking lawsuit. Other than for acts of
dishonesty or plagiarism, we indemnify all of our reporters
and
editors for all costs and damages in any lawsuit.<p>

10. NOTES<p>

Keep accurate, complete notes. That means keeping the time
and
date of all interviews, as well as the time and date of all
messages left and with whom they were left. In order to
avoid
clutter, you might want to discard your notes, but please
wait
four weeks after publication before you do so. That way,
we'll
have your notes if anyone questions the accuracy of your
work.<p>

In instances where you think someone may later deny being
interviewed, it's usually a good idea to write something
detailed
in your notes about the location of the interview, e.g.
something
about what the office looks like or what pictures were on
the
wall.<p>

11.  STYLE POINTS<p>

Good reporters must be good writers as well. This means
following
rules of grammar, usage and style. It also means writing a
story
as strongly as your reporting allows but no stronger and
constructing it clearly and logically for your reader.<p>

A good editor can be a good writer's best friend in
accomplishing
these goals. A good writer will listen attentively to an
editor's
suggestions and cooperate in making revisions to meet sound
criticisms. At the same time, a good editor will remember to
respect a reporter's knowledge of the story and to defer to
individual matters of style where appropriate.<p>

Your editor will provide you with our style manual and with
the
other authorities we rely on. Here are some style points
that
should be stressed:<p>

a) Use full names: Always use full, formal first names,
never
"Billy Bob" or "Tom." Don't let readers think that some
source is
your best friend. For lawyers, use Martindale-Hubbell as the
standard.<p>

b) Avoid redundancy: Never say "still pending," "general
consensus," "lawsuit," or "future plans."<p>
 
c) Be precise: Never use "sources say" or "a source said" as
an
attribution. Don't say "several" if you mean three. Don't
say
"more than two dozen" if you know it's 28. And if you don't
know
if it's somewhere between 28 and 32, say that, or say
"approximately 30," but don't just say "more than 28."<p>

12. CAPTIONS<p>

Our rule is that there should always be a caption, even if
it's
just a name burnt into a photo over a long pull quote. Think
to
yourself: Is there any chance that a reader will doubt, even
for
a second, who this person is? Too much identification is
never a
problem; too little is. Your job is to make reading (and
being
informed) easier for our customers.<p>


13. IDENTIFYING PEOPLE<p>

Don't hesitate to re-identify people. If you mentioned
someone
1,000 words ago (or before the jump), tell us again
(parenthetically, if necessary) who he is. The Wall Street
Journal is great about this; just about every other paper is
terrible. Your job isn't to prove that readers are fools, or
aren't paying enough attention. It's to make it easy for
them to
read what you write. Bear in mind that people often jump
into a
piece in the middle to see if they want to read it. You
can't
compensate for that fully, but this helps.<p>

14. CATCHING REDUNDANCY AND RHYTHM<p>

Read out loud, in order to check for annoying redundancy and
bad
rhythm. You'll often know it only when you hear it. The best
way
to read a piece the way a reader will is to read it aloud to
yourself.<p>

15. GUIDELINES FOR PHOTOGRAPHY<p>

Quality journalism is not limited to words. We respect and
want
good photography.<p>

Like any good journalist, a photographer working for this
company
should always be thinking how best to tell the story.
Obviously,
environmental props are helpful: for instance, if a lawyer
defends farmers, take him out to the fields. If he has
bizarre
(and relevant) knick-knacks in his office, include them in
the
shot. But most frequently, our photographers will be
confronted
with a special challenge. What lawyers do, at first glance,
looks
quite dull. It's not like shooting sports events or riots.
The
challenge is to look for subtlety. If there is no
interesting
environment, we can do the most classic photograph - the
portrait. Not a ho-hum, who cares, five-frame snap, but an
insightful portrait that strongly brings out the personality
of
the subject. There is a big difference between a powerful
portrait and the wooden publicity head shot that a trade
paper
would normally run. We want the powerful portrait.<p>

We encourage our photographers to be involved with their
pictures
even after they are taken. Photographers shouldn't hesitate
to
protest and come up with solutions if their pictures aren't
getting good play, good captions, or good reproduction. We
want
the best possible photographs for each story, and we want
them to
look right.<p>

The photos we take should reflect the truth. We don't try to
make
people look better or worse than they are. If the subject is
a
slob, we take a picture that shows it. If he is neat, we
take a
picture that shows that. If he has blemishes, we don't
retouch
them. To be fair, if he unintentionally looks like an idiot,
you
could help by pointing out his unzipped fly. But if his desk
is
messy and it's relevant to the story, shoot him there
without
trying to make it nice.<p>

Photographers should never set up shots in which a situation
is
faked, even if that picture is identified as a set-up in the
cutline. News is news and should never be faked. You can get
the
bankruptcy lawyer to stand in front of the company that just
went
bankrupt. This is legitimate combining of relevant facts.
But
posing him reenacting the time when he boarded up the
company's
door with hammer and nails is wrong. However, it's okay to
pose
him in front of the door holding the hammer. It's not fake,
and
the caption can make reference to the real timing of
events.<p>

Retouching should be done only to alter minor points about
the
photo. It should never be done to alter the facts or to
change
anyone's appearance. Flopping photos when they're used is
also a
bad idea. Photos can be altered to emphasize the facts, such
as
fading the background slightly to better portray people in
the
foreground.<p>

Staff photographers' prints and negatives (that is, photos
shot
for the publication) are owned by the company. Free-lance
photographers own their own copyrights and are paid by the
assignment or by the piece.<p>

All photographers guarantee that the work they submit is
their
own. You also guarantee that your work has not been altered,
by
setting up a false situation, by substantive retouching, or
by
any other means.<p>

All photographers are indemnified by this company against
lawsuits from people they are assigned to shoot. So, don't
be
cowed by a hostile lawyer who threatens to sue you if you
press
the shutter. It is legal to photograph people against their
will
if you both are on public property. This does not come up
very
often, but when it does, you are protected.<p>

All photo departments must have organized files. Pictures
must be
credited carefully, free-lancers' and photo agencies' bills
should be paid right away, and any prints or negatives we
don't
own have to be returned quickly. Unlike most newspapers, we
do
keep free-lancers' prints, with their permission, but the
burden
is on us to make sure the photographer is paid for any
re-use.<p>

Details on photo use, contracts, and our chain wide photo
library
are available through the photo department at The American
Lawyer.<p>

16. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST<p>

The key to our conflicts policy is disclosure. Tell your
editor
about any potential conflict or anything that could create
the
appearance of conflict in your reporting or editing. You
should
also, in most cases, tell your readers.<p>

Conflicts arise when you write about close friends or
relatives,
about entities or people on whom close friends or relatives
are
dependent, or about subjects or entities in which you might
have
some financial interest. It is easy to say that if you are
writing or editing or even know about a story in any of our
publications that might affect the value of a stock, you
should
not trade in that stock for a six-month period surrounding
the
article (and not own significant amounts of it in the first
place
without informing your editor and your readers). But with
our
publications, as with most others, conflicts are rarely that
clear. The key s advance disclosure.<p>

17. GIFTS<p>

Gifts of any significant value (more than $50) from any
person
you might be writing about now or in the future should not
be
accepted. Gifts of less than $50 must be disclosed to your
editor. You should refuse even minor gifts whenever you can
do so
gracefully.<p>

You may, however, accept a lunch or a dinner from a source,
including the subject of a story, if that person has invited
you
and picks the place and asks to pay, and your insistence
that he
not would be awkward, insulting or just plain much ado about
nothing. But in any other situation, including any ambiguous
situation, you should pay and charge it to the company.
Under no
circumstances should you accept anything else of value from
a
subject or potential subject, including but not limited to
free
trips.<p>

18. AD-EDIT SEPARATION<p>

As you know, we do not in any way let factors related to
advertisers and potential advertisers influence our
editorial
decisions. However, because ours are commonly seen as
"trade"
publications, and because such ad-edit distinctions are
often
blurred in trade publications, some advertisers and
potential
advertisers may not understand or appreciate our policy.
Thus,
those involved in reporting and editing articles may get
inquiries and even threats about advertising.<p>

You should explain our policy in a friendly way. But no one
on
the editorial side should ever discuss, even casually, with
a
subject or potential subject of a story the benefits of
advertising in our publications. If someone makes an
inquiry, you
should refer them to an advertising salesperson.<p>

Our own advertising salespeople know that they should not
talk to
reporters or other editorial people about advertisers'
requests
or questions concerning our editorial product. If they have
specific ideas for our publications, we ask that they talk
to the
editor. This doesn't mean you should never talk to our ad
people.
You can learn from their knowledge of the legal marketplace,
and
they can learn about our editorial approach from your
experience.
But be careful: don't talk about specific advertisers or the
details of our editorial content. If you ever feel that an
advertising salesperson is pressuring you or inquiring
improperly, please tell that person. If it persists, tell
your
editor.<p>

<H3>Understanding the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA): A Primer</h3>  

c.1995 Richard K. Berger.<p>

<H4>Editor's note: This primer on ADA is an example of a document
that could be prepared for clients or for other educational
purposes.<p>

Author's caveat: The contents of this article: (a) should not be
considered or relied upon as legal, financial or other
professional advice in any manner whatsoever, and; (b) may be
considered advertising under the Rules of the Supreme Judicial
Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts of the United States
of America. Unless otherwise stated, this article, is, has not
been updated or revised for accuracy as statutory or case law
changes following the date of first publication in June, 1995.
Always consult with your lawyer and/or your other professionals
before acting.</h4>

<hr><p>

You have complied with the laws relating to discrimination based
on sex, origin, religion, nationality and race. The next
generation of legal obligations from Congress involves
disabilities. As a primer, here's what you need to know. The
Americans with Disabilities Act (the ADA) was passed by the
United States Congress in 1990. Title I of the Act deals with
issues of employment, while the other titles deal with issues
including public service, public accommodation, and
telecommunications. From July 26, 1992 to July 26, 1994, Title I
of the ADA applied only to those employers having 25 or more
employees. As of July 27, 1994, the employee number is reduced to
15. Covering virtually all aspects of employment (including job
application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of
employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms,
conditions, and privileges of employment), the Act prohibits
employers from intentionally or unintentionally discriminating
against persons with disabilities, and it obligates them to make
reasonable accommodations in the workplace to allow disabled
persons to perform the essential functions of their job. The Act
is a very powerful social tool.<p>

Is every disability covered under the Act? No. Under the Act, a
disability is: "(A) a physical or mental impairment that
substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of
such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being
regarded as having such an impairment." (42 U.S.C.  12102 (2))
Examples of disabilities covered under the Act are: cerebral
palsy; muscular dystrophy; emotional illness; epilepsy; heart
disease; specific learning disabilities; cancer; diabetes; HIV
positive; multiple sclerosis; mental retardation, and; hearing
and speech disorders. Not all disabilities are covered under the
Act. For instance, employees currently using illegal drugs (i.e.
because they are addicted) will receive no protection under the
Act. However, a recovered addict can not be denied employment or
any of its other privileges simply on the basis that he or she
was an addict in the past. An exhaustive discussion of exactly
which potential disabilities may or may not be targeted under the
Act for protection is beyond the scope of this article, and in
every event should be decided in the workplace on a case-by- case
basis with the advice of counsel.<p>

What is a "reasonable accommodation"? Congress provided that: The
term 'reasonable accommodation' may include: (A) making existing
facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by
individuals with disabilities; and (B) job restructuring, part
time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant
position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices,
appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training
materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or
interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals
with disabilities. (42 U.S.C. Section 12111 (9)) The employer has
the burden to acknowledge the disability and work to find a
reasonable accommodation -- and this entire process should be
well and thoroughly documented especially if the employer in its
final analysis determines that a "reasonable accommodation"
cannot be found. This can be a significant burden (administrative
and otherwise) on the employer, but if handled carefully and
properly the desired result may be accomplished usually for
little or no cost and in complete compliance with the Act. For
example, a hearing-impaired person (who as an essential function
of his or her job needs to answer the phone and take messages)
may be accommodated through providing him or her with a cordless
phone equipped for the hearing-impaired. A person confined to a
wheelchair (who works in an office) may be accommodated by having
a raised desk under which the chair will fit, or by simply
raising the desk with blocks. There are many governmental and
private organizations which can be used to assist the employer in
working to find a reasonable accommodation for a disabled
prospective or already-hired employee -- and this will make the
employer's job much easier as well as adding credibility to the
employer's efforts. <p>

Does the employer always have to accommodate the disabled person?
No. As broad as it is, the Act does not require any employer to
accommodate a disability which, even with the accommodation,
would pose a direct threat (meaning a significant risk) to the
health or safety of the disabled person or others. The Act also
provides that employers do not have to make accommodations which
would amount to an "undue burden" on their business. The factors
to be considered in determining whether an accommodation would
constitute an "undue hardship" have been set out by Congress as
follows: In determining whether an accommodation would impose an
undue hardship on a covered entity, factors to be considered
include (i) the nature and cost of the accommodation needed under
this chapter; (ii) the overall financial resources of the
facility or facilities involved in the provision of the
reasonable accommodation; the number of persons employed at such
facility; the effect on expenses and resources, or the impact
otherwise of such accommodation upon the operation of the
facility; (iii) the overall financial resources of the covered
entity; the overall size of the business of a covered entity with
respect to the number of its employees; the number, type, and
location of its facilities; and (iv) the type of operation or
operations of the covered entity, including the composition,
structure, and functions of the workforce of such entity; the
geographic separateness, administrative, or fiscal relationship
of the facility or facilities in question to the covered entity.<p>

These amorphous factors have begun and will continually gain specific
form and shape through federal regulations, litigation (lawsuits), and
state and federal government investigations. Among other things, I would
suggest that to avoid litigation the input of the prospective or
already-hired employee be sought on this issue to empower him or her and
thereby increase a sense of team spirit and decrease the animolying with
the Act. Whether large or small, if your company falls under the
jurisdiction of the ADA, you should work closely with your counsel to
proactively handle ADA compliance at all stages of employment from
hiring to discharge. If you are large enough to have your own HR
department, have them work with your counsel. If your HR department
tells you that they don't need counsel to help them because they know
exactly what to do, ask them to sign a personal guarantee to that
effect. If they won't, ask them why and then pick up the phone and call
your lawyer.<p>

<H3>SURVEY: COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF TITLE III OF THE
AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT</h3>

The purpose of this survey is to determine what steps Bay Area
law firms have taken to alter their facilities in order to comply
with the letter and spirit of the ADA. Title III of the Act
requires that most alterations and new construction in commercial
facilities meet certain accessibility guidelines developed by the
Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board. Title
III also requires the removal of certain structural barriers in
places of public accommodation and mandates the provision of
certain auxiliary aids and services.<p> 

1. Please indicate on a separate sheet of paper what renovations,
alterations and/or barrier removals your law firm has made to
comply with Title III. If applicable, also indicate in a separate
section, what changes your law firm intends to make in the
future.<p>

a. Halls, corridors, aisles, skywalks, tunnels and other
accessible routes.<p> 

b. Objects projecting from walls (e.g. artwork, telephones, fire
extinguishers).<p>

c. Overhanging objects and overhead hazards.<p> 

d. Ground and floor surfaces. (Please consider changes in level,
carpet, tile and grading.) <p>

e. Ramps; Stairs (interior and exterior); and Entrances to your
facilities. <p>

f. Elevators; Wheelchair lifts. <p>

g. Doors; Windows.<p>

h. Drinking fountains and water coolers.<p>

i. Toilet stalls, urinals, bathtubs, showerstalls, lavatory
fixtures, sinks and mirrors. <p>

j. Alarms (audible or visual; Signage. <p>

k. Telephones. <p>

l. Fixed or built-in seating and tables. <p>

m. Firm conference rooms; Libraries. <p>

n. Cafeterias. <p>

2. What auxiliary aids and services does your law firm have on
hand? What aids are available on short notice? <p>

3. Are there any other steps which your law firm has taken to
comply with Title III of the ADA? <p>

<H3>SURVEY OF PERSONNEL POLICIES & EMPLOYEE BENEFITS</h3?

Check box on left side if your law firm has the applicable
personnel policies or benefits for attorneys. Check box on right
side if the policy specifically refers to disability. Please
provide a copy of the policy or benefit if possible.<p>

<H2>Online Legal Updates</H2>

<P>Online Legal Updates are provided by sponsoring lawyers and law firms as a quick, easy way for you to learn more about laws that affect you or your family. Written by individual lawyers or attorneys at law firms from around the country, the Family Law Online Legal Updates are organized by state or jurisdiction because domestic laws vary from state to state, sometimes dramatically. The Updates may include links to legal documents and case law as well as information about the authoring attorney or law firm.</P>

<P>We encourage you to send the authors questions via the e-mail response forms at the end of each Update. Remember, however, that any answers you receive, like the Online Legal Updates themselves, are not legal advice. (See the disclaimer below).</P>

<P>The attorneys and law firms appearing here have paid a sponsorship fee to be listed. If you would like information about including your law firm in the Court TV Family Law Center's Online Legal Update program, or if you have questions or comments about this area, please e-mail your requests and comments to: <A HREF="mailto:online@counsel.com">online@counsel.com</A>.</P>

COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY, INJUNCTIVE AND MONETARY RELIEF
SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE AND JURY DEMAND


Preliminary Statement

1. This is an action against National Public Radio and two of its
managing officials for monetary damages, declaratory judgment,
injunctive relief and specific performance to compensate plaintiff
Mumia Abu-Jamal, an inmate on Pennsylvania's Death Row, for the
injuries he has suffered as a result of NPR's cancellation of his
contract to appear as a regular Commentator  on its "All Things
Considered" program and its refusal to broadcast and to return to him
and the Prison Radio Project audio tapes of commentaries that Mr.
Jamal prepared and delivered and the Prison Radio Project produced
and recorded for inclusion on "All Things Considered."  Bruce
Drake, NPR's Managing Editor, cancelled Mr. Jamal as a regular
Commentator on "All Things Considered" on the eve of NPR's first
broadcast of his commentaries in response to pressure exerted by
Senator Robert Dole, the Fraternal Order of Police, and other
conservative opponents of the political viewpoints that Mr. Jamal has
expressed and that he symbolizes in the public arena.

Defendants' actions violated Mr. Jamal's right to be free from
governmental censorship under the First Amendment to the United
States Constitution, plaintiffs' rights not to be deprived of their
property without just compensation under the Fifth Amendment to
the United States Constitution, and plaintiffs' rights to be free from
arbitrary or capricious governmental action under the Fifth
Amendment to the United States Constitution. In addition, by
refusing to broadcast Mr. Jamal's commentaries, NPR willfully
breached its contract with Mr. Jamal and the Prison Radio Project,
and by refusing to return the tapes of the commentaries to plaintiffs,
NPR abrogated plaintiffs' common law rights against the wrongful
withholding and conversion of their property.

Jurisdiction

2. This court has original jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28
U.S.C. 1331, and supplemental jurisdiction over related claims
under 28 U.S.C. 1367. Venue is proper in this jurisdiction under
28 U.S.C. 1391(b) and (e) because defendants reside in the District
ofColumbia, a substantial part of the events giving rise to this suit
occurred in this District, and NPR is an agency or instrumentality of
the United States Government and Messrs. Drake and Buzenberg are
federal officials or employees.

Parties

3. Mumia Abu-Jamal is an African-American citizen of the United
States currently residing at the Pennsylvania State Correctional
Institute at Greene. He is an internationally known and award-
winning journalist, writer, political activist, cultural commentator,
and death row prisoner. He has dedicated the greater portion of his
adult life to engaging in political and professional activities to expose
and oppose racism and social oppression in the United States. In 1968,
Mr. Jamal became a founding member and Minister of Information of
the Philadelphia chapter of the Black Panther Party, at which time he
also became subject to years of Federal Bureau of Investigation
surveillance under its covert COINTELPRO counter-insurgency
program. In the 1970s he worked as a radio reporter in the
Philadelphia area and was widely known as a journalist willing to
investigate, expose and denounce racist, brutal and illegal practices of
the Philadelphia Police Department. His reports were aired on
National Public Radio, the Mutual Black Network, the National
Black Network, as well as local radio stations. At the time of his
arrest in 1981, Mr. Jamal was the President of the Philadelphia
Association of Black Journalists, a well-known supporter of the MOVE community,
and a vocal critic of the Philadelphia Police Department, particularly
with respect to its violent 1978 siege of the MOVE community's
Powelton Village home by more than 600 heavily armed police
officers.

4. The Prison Radio Project, a project of the Quixote Center, is a
public interest organization committed to helping powerless and
largely silenced groups in American society, particularly prisoners,
voice their views and perspectives through the medium of radio
broadcasts. It maintains its principal place of business at 3502
Varnum Street, Brentwood, Maryland 20722. Its activities include
producing radio broadcasts and serving as a research and
development resource for various media outlets interested in covering
prisons. It has achieved unique expertise in recording at a high level
of  broadcast quality from within prisons. At the time of the events
giving rise to this suit, Noelle Hanrahan was the Director of the
Prison Radio Project and had the legal authority to act on its behalf.
At all times relevant to this complaint, Ms. Hanrahan had explicit
authorization from Mr. Jamal to act as his agent and representative
with respect to the subject of the recording and broadcasting of his
commentaries.

5. National Public Radio ("NPR") is a non-profit, public
broadcasting radio network incorporated under the laws of the
District of Columbia, with its principal place of business at 635
Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20001-3753. The
registered agent of NPR is Lee Satterfield, 635 Massachusetts
Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20001.

6. Bruce Drake was at the time of the events giving rise to this
Complaint and continues to be the Managing Editor of NPR. His
business address is 635 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington,
D.C. 20001-3753. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Mr. Drake
acted within the scope of his employment and in furtherance of
NPR's interests. As Managing Editor, he had policymaking
authority over programming decisions at NPR.

7. William Buzenberg was at the time of the events giving rise to this
suit and continues to be the Vice-President for News and Information
of NPR. His business address is 635 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20001-3753. At all times relevant to this
Complaint, Mr. Buzenberg acted within the scope of his employment
and in furtherance of NPR's interests. As Vice-President for News
and Information, he had policymaking authority over programming
decisions at NPR.

Factual Allegations

8. Mr. Jamal was convicted in 1982 of killing Daniel Faulkner, a
Philadelphia police officer. Since his arrest in December, 1981, Mr.
Jamal has consistently maintained that he did not kill Officer Faulkner
and that he is innocent of the crime of murder. His conviction has
been the subject of intense legal and public protest centering around
the fundamental unfairness of his trial, including the lack of
competent counsel, the systematic exclusion of African-Americans
from his jury, police intimidation of witnesses and fabrication of
evidence, prosecutorial misconduct, and the prejudicial introduction
of inflammatory evidence of Mr. Jamal's past political statements and
associations, including his involvement with the Black Panther Party.
His execution has been stayed pending the resolution in Pennsylvania
courts of post-conviction petitions for a new trial based on these and
other violations of his right to a fair trial process.

9. Mr. Jamal's arrest, conviction, and death sentence have become
the focus for worldwide attention to the issues of racism in the
criminal justice system and the immorality of the death penalty. The
unfairness of his trial, incarceration, and death sentence has been
denounced by various well-known statesmen, artists, cultural figures
and intellectuals, including Nelson Mandela, Ossie Davis, Mario Van
Peebles, Whoopi Goldberg, Ed Asner, Harry Belafonte, E.L.
Doctorow, Alice Walker, Stephen Jay Gould, Tony Benn, John
Edgar Wideman, and twenty-two Members of the Congressional
Black Caucus. In addition, a wide range of domestic and
international organizations have called for a new trial for Mr. Jamal,
including the National Conference of Black Lawyers and, by
unanimous vote, the European Parliament of the European Union.
Popular rallies on his behalf have been held as far away as Germany
and Australia.

10. Mr. Jamal has also been the object of widespread public
condemnation and denunciation by proponents of the death penalty
and by various supporters of the Philadelphia Police Department,
including the National and Philadelphia Chapters of the Fraternal
Order of Police and Senator Robert Dole (R-Kansas).

11. At the time of the events giving rise to this suit and until January
13, 1995, Mr. Jamal was incarcerated at the State Correctional
Institution at Huntingdon ("Huntingdon"). During the period of his
incarceration at Huntingdon, Mr. Jamal continued to express views
against racism and bias in the criminal justice system and against the
mistreatment of prisoners in the United States through writings and
broadcast commentaries and reports. His writings have been
published in various publications, including The Nation and the Yale
Law Journal. Mr. Jamal is the author of a collection of essays, Live
from Death Row, published in 1995.

12. In July, 1992, the Prison Radio Project began recording and
producing radio commentaries written and delivered by Mr. Jamal
from his incarceration on death row for broadcast on public radio
stations in the United States and abroad.

13. On or about February 14, 1994, acting with the consent of and
on behalf of Mr. Jamal and the Prison Radio Project, Ms. Hanrahan
met with Ellen Weiss, the Executive Producer of "All Things
Considered," for the purpose of auditioning Mr. Jamal as a possible
Commentator for the "All Things Considered" program.

14. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Ms. Weiss was acting as
a representative of NPR with actual and apparent authority to enter
into legally binding agreements for NPR with respect to the
commissioning of commentaries for the "All Things Considered"
program.

15. On or about February 14, 1994, after hearing a sample of Mr.
Jamal's radio commentaries, Ms. Weiss told Ms. Hanrahan that Mr.
Jamal offered a "unique perspective" that "my audience needs to
hear."  Ms. Weiss expressly promised Ms. Hanrahan that NPR's
decision whether to air his commentaries would not be affected by
the facts that Mr. Jamal was on death row, that he had been convicted
of killing a police officer, or that the broadcast of his commentaries
could create intense public controversy. Ms. Weiss stated to Ms.
Hanrahan that she was almost certain that NPR wanted to record and
broadcast Mr. Jamal's commentaries, but that as a "pro forma" matter
she needed to clear her decision with others in NPR management. In
reliance on these representations, at the conclusion of the meeting
Ms. Hanrahan left a notebook of Mr. Jamal's writings with Ms.
Weiss for consideration as part of the series of commentaries that Mr.
Jamal would record for "All Things Considered."

16. As a result of the February 1994 meeting and later in the same
month, Ms. Weiss told Ms. Hanrahan that NPR management had
agreed with her decision to broadcast commentaries by Mr. Jamal on
"All Things Considered."  Ms. Weiss and Ms. Hanrahan agreed that
NPR would broadcast on the "All Things Considered" program a
series of commentaries about prison life, racial justice and crime,
written and delivered by Mr. Jamal and produced and recorded by the
Prison Radio Project.

17. In February, 1994, Ms. Weiss and Ms. Hanrahan expressly
agreed that Mr. Jamal would write several new commentaries to fit
the format for Commentator contributions on "All Things
Considered," that NPR would assist the Prison Radio Project in
recording Mr.Jamal reading his commentaries, that the Prison Radio
Project would attend to administrative matters involved in conducting
such a recording session with Mr. Jamal, produce the commentaries,
and contribute its technical expertise in recording a death row
prisoner for broadcast, and that NPR would pay specified expenses
incurred by the Prison Radio Project.

18. During the same conversation referenced in paragraph 17 above,
Ms. Weiss and Ms. Hanrahan agreed that, in consideration for the
work that Mr. Jamal and the Prison Radio Project were contributing,
NPR would broadcast at least six commentaries on "All Things
Considered," at the rate of one a month, provided that the recordings
were of sufficient technical quality to satisfy NPR's broadcast
standards. NPR further agreed to compensate Mr. Jamal according
to NPR's usual and customary rates for compensating
Commentators.

19. The terms and conditions described in paragraphs 17 and 18
above, constituted a binding contract between and among NPR, Mr.
Jamal, and the Prison Radio Project.

20. NPR's promise to broadcast Mr. Jamal's commentaries on its
"All Things Considered" program represented a unique opportunity
for Mr. Jamal to communicate his views. NPR's "All Things
Considered" program has the widest audience of any non-
commercially produced public affairs radio program produced in the
United States, reaching some seven to ten million listeners
worldwide through NPR's network of broadcast affiliates.

21. In reliance on their agreement with NPR, Mr. Jamal and the
Prison Radio Project agreed to forego any attempts to have the
commentaries in question aired on any other broadcast outlet which
were available at the time that Mr. Jamal and the Prison Radio Project
entered into their contract with NPR.

22. By letter to Mr. Jamal dated March 10, 1994, Ms. Weiss
confirmed the agreement that she and Ms. Hanrahan reached with
respect to the commentaries that Mr. Jamal would create and that the
Prison Radio Project would produce and record, and expressly
promised that NPR would broadcast one commentary a month for six
consecutive months.

23. Pursuant to the above-described agreement, between March 24,
1994, and April 10, 1994, Mr. Jamal's agent delivered a group of
five written commentaries to Laura Westley, an Assistant Editor of
"All Things Considered."

24. During the period between March 24, 1994 and April 10, 1994,
representatives of NPR selected ten of Mr. Jamal's written
commentaries to record and broadcast on "All Things Considered."

25. Pursuant to the contract described in paragraphs 17 and 18,
above, on April 15, 1994, Ms. Hanrahan, Ms. Westley, and Patricia
Gordon Hammond, an NPR engineer, met Mr. Jamal at the State
Correctional Institution in Huntingdon and recorded his reading of
the ten commentaries that NPR had selected for broadcast.
Following the recording session, Ms. Westley stated that Mr. Jamal
was "one of the three best commentators we have ever recorded."

26. On April 18, 1994, Ms. Westley called Ms. Hanrahan and
notified her that the recordings were of good technical quality and
would be broadcast on the "All Things Considered" program as NPR
previously agreed.

27. On one occasion between April 18, 1994 and April 25, 1994,
Ms. Weiss called Ms. Hanrahan and advised her that "we are very
excited about our new Commentator" and that the publicity
department would promote the commentaries for about a month
before NPR would begin to air them.

28. On or about April 25, 1994, NPR issued a press release
announcing that Mr. Jamal's commentaries would be broadcast on
"All Things Considered" and began general promotion of Mr.
Jamal's commentaries.

29. On or about May 10, 1994, Ms. Westley called Ms. Hanrahan to
notify her that NPR assigned a specific air date of May 16, 1994, for
the debut of Mr. Jamal's commentaries on "All Things Considered"
in order to facilitate promotion of Mr. Jamal's appearance on the
program.

30. Beginning on or about May 12, 1994, and continuing through
May 15, 1994, the National and Philadelphia Chapters of the
Fraternal Order of Police began issuing public denunciations of
NPR's decision to air Mr. Jamal's commentaries and engaged in
concerted and coordinated actions to contact state and federal officials
and urge them to pressure NPR not to broadcast Mr. Jamal's
commentaries by threatening to restrict the funds of NPR and its
affiliate stations.

31. Upon information and belief, police officers employed by the
Philadelphia Police Department and other police departments around
the United States engaged in concerted action to pressure NPR not to
broadcast Mr. Jamal's commentaries and to prevent Mr. Jamal from
airing his political and social views, including but not limited to
calling local and national talk radio programs expressing derogatory
opinions about Mr. Jamal, urging people to cease contributing to
NPR and its affiliates, and contacting various elected officials for the
purpose of  engaging them in a campaign to threaten NPR with
funding reductions if it broadcast Mr. Jamal's views.

32. Upon information and belief, Senator Dole and other Members
of Congress and various federal and state governmental officials
contacted NPR on or before May 15, 1994, to demand that NPR not
broadcast Mr. Jamal's commentaries.

33. Upon information and belief, the actions described in paragraphs
31 and 32 above were taken because of political and ideological
disagreement with the views that Mr. Jamal expressed and the
viewpoints that he symbolized with respect to the death penalty,
police brutality and racism in Philadelphia, and police brutality and
racism in the United States more generally.

34. On or about May 15, 1994, NPR officials, including Messrs.
Drake and Buzenberg, decided to cancel the scheduled broadcast of
Mr. Jamal's commentaries on "All Things Considered," and, upon
information and belief, directed Mr. Drake, Mr. Buzenberg and
others to issue public statements-offering false and pretextual
justifications for NPR's abrupt cancellation of Mr. Jamal's
commentaries.

35. Soon thereafter, NPR permanently cancelled Mr. Jamal's
appearance as a Commentator on its "All Things Considered"
program, and refused to broadcast Mr. Jamal's commentaries, in
violation of the contract set out in paragraphs 17 and 18 above.

36. NPR's actions in refusing to broadcast Mr. Jamal's
commentaries and cancelling Mr. Jamal's appearance as
Commentator on "All Things Considered" were motivated by
improper considerations concerning the content of Mr. Jamal's
speech, his political viewpoints, and his political associations, and
were caused directly and proximately by the pressure exerted by
Senator Dole and other conservative opponents of the political
viewpoints that Mr. Jamal has expressed.

37. On May 15, 1994, and at various times since that date, Messrs.
Drake and Buzenberg and other NPR employees and officials issued
statements to the press that disparaged the quality of Mr. Jamal's
commentaries and offered false and pretextual grounds for NPR's
actions in refusing to broadcast Mr. Jamal's commentaries, all of
which directly and proximately caused damage to the professional
reputations of Mr. Jamal and the Prison Radio Project.

38. On May 17, 1994, in a speech given on the floor of the United
States Senate, Senator Dole denounced NPR and threatened closer
Congressional oversight and reduction of NPR's funding because of
NPR's initial decision to broadcast Mr. Jamal's  commentaries.

39. On May 17, 1994, Ms. Weiss called Ms. Hanrahan and told her
that she was "in shock" about the cancellation of Mr. Jamal's
commentaries and that she had not considered congressional
opposition to NPR's decision to broadcast Mr. Jamal's commentaries
at the time NPR had initially agreed to broadcast his commentaries.
She further stated "this never set off any red flags for us. We had no
idea it would be censored."

40. On June 14, 1994, Ms. Weiss refused Ms. Hanrahan's request
that the audio tapes, or a broadcast quality copy of the audio tapes,
containing the commentaries that NPR recorded on April 15, 1994,
be returned to the Prison Radio Project or to Mr. Jamal.

41. In July 1994, during an interview on WNYC-AM's "On the
Media", John Dinges, then NPR's Editorial Director, admitted that
NPR cancelled Mr. Jamal's commentaries based on the content of his
speech. He stated, "[w]e in fact made a decision not to go ahead
with those commentaries because we thought it was not good
journalism to put somebody on the air in the role of a kind of
Anthony Lewis on public radio."  He went on to say that Mr. Jamal's
"unique political position because of his crime and because of his
political associations" caused NPR not to broadcast Mr. Jamal's
commentaries.

42. As a result of the above-described censorship of Mr. Jamal by
NPR and the attendant publicity over Mr. Jamal's scheduled
appearance on "All Things Considered," Pennsylvania prison
officials have terminated virtually all electronic press contact for Mr.
Jamal and have refused to allow him to continue recording
commentaries for radio broadcast.

43. On June 9, 1995, in a speech delivered on the Senate floor,
Senator Dole asserted that NPR's abrupt reversal of its decision to air
Mr. Jamal's commentaries was due to pressure brought to bear by
Members of Congress, including himself.

44. Since the above-described events and continuing to the present,
Ms. Weiss and NPR have refused to broadcast Mr. Jamal's
commentaries and have refused to return to Mr. Jamal or the Prison
Radio Project the audio tapes or copies of the tapes embodying the
commentaries that were recorded on April 15, 1994, despite repeated
requests made on behalf of Mr. Jamal that the tapes be aired or
returned.

45. Upon information and belief, NPR has not subjected any other
Commentator with whom it has contracted to this type of arbitrary
and capricious cancellation of his or her contract with NPR. NPR's
actions constituted an arbitrary and capricious departure from prior
NPR policy and accepted broadcast norms.

FROM GOVERNMENTAL CENSORSHIP PURSUANT TO THE
FIRST AND FIFTH AMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES
CONSTITUTION.

46. Plaintiffs incorporate as though restated each of the factual
allegations stated in paragraphs 1 through 45 above.

47. Mr. Jamal is entitled to freedom of expression and freedom from
governmental censorship of his speech under the First and Fifth
Amendments to the United States Constitution.

48. The views contained in the commentaries at issue in this suit
constitute political speech and are entitled to the highest degree of
First Amendment protection.

49. At all times relevant to this complaint, NPR and its agents and
representatives were acting as an agency or instrumentality of the
United States government within the meaning of the First and Fifth
Amendments to the United States Constitution.

50. At all times relevant to this complaint, NPR received a
substantial portion of its funding from state and federal governmental
sources, including but not limited to direct or indirect Congressional
appropriations, grants from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,
and funding from State-owned public radio broadcast affiliates and
member organizations.

51. NPR was created by the Corporation for Public  Broadcasting,
an agency or instrumentality of the United States  Government, in
order to fulfill the policies and objectives of  the United States
Government and pursuant to Congressional direction as embodied in
the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, 47 U.S.C. 396.

52. NPR is supervised and controlled by the United States
Government and its agencies, instrumentalities, and officials.

53. There is a significant and substantial nexus between NPR and
the governments of the United States and individual States and
significant and substantial involvement with and influence over the
management of NPR by the governments of the United States and
individual States.

54. The actions taken by NPR and its agents and representatives in
refusing to broadcast Mr. Jamal's commentaries were based on the
political viewpoints that Mr. Jamal expressed and symbolized and
constitute viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First and Fifth
Amendments to the United States Constitution.

55. NPR's continuing refusal to broadcast Mr. Jamal's
commentaries and to return the tapes or copies of them to Mr. Jamal
constitute attempts to suppress his political views and the viewpoints
that he publicly symbolizes, in violation of the First and Fifth
Amendments to the United States Constitution.

56. NPR's actions in suppressing Mr. Jamal's political views were
encouraged and/or authorized by agencies, instrumentalities, and
officials of the governments of the United States and individual
States.

57. NPR's actions in suppressing Mr. Jamal's political views were
taken under color of federal law.

58. NPR's actions in suppressing Mr. Jamal's political views were
taken pursuant to a policy, practice or custom requiring the
censorship and exclusion from NPR programming of political views
and commentaries that offend conservative Members of Congress
and other groups which NPR officials have concluded can and do
influence the funding of NPR.

59. At the time that defendants NPR, Buzenberg and Drake excluded
Mr. Jamal's speech from its programming, the right of a speaker to
be free from viewpoint discrimination by governmental actors was
clearly established under the First Amendment and judicial precedent.

60. The actions of defendants in refusing to broadcast Mr. Jamal's
commentaries manifested a reckless indifference to, and willful and
wanton disregard of, Mr. Jamal's clearly established constitutional
rights, and directly and proximately caused plaintiffs injury,
including the suppression of plaintiff's political views, the loss of
opportunities to communicate with the audience of "All Things
Considered," the loss of  opportunities to seek other broadcast outlets
for the commentaries, and damage to plaintiffs' professional
reputations. NPR's actions enumerated herein also caused economic
loss to the Prison Radio Project.


PROPERTY WITHOUT JUST COMPENSATION UNDER THE
FIFTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES
CONSTITUTION.

61. Plaintiffs incorporate as though restated each of the factual
allegations stated in paragraphs 1 through 60 above.

62. Mr. Jamal and the Prison Radio Project have the right under the
takings clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States
Constitution not to be deprived of their property without just
compensation.

63. The commentaries written and delivered by Mr. Jamal and
recorded on April 15, 1994, through the production skill and
expertise of the Prison Radio Project, embody significant property of
Mr. Jamal and the Prison Radio Project in the nature of common law
or statutory copyright interests.

64. NPR's appropriation of the audio tapes of Mr. Jamal's
commentaries and its continuing refusal to return them to plaintiffs
constitute a taking of plaintiffs' property without just compensation,
which directly and proximately caused plaintiffs substantial harm.

COUNT THREE -- VIOLATION OF RIGHTS AGAINST THE
DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY OR PROPERTY WITHOUT DUE
PROCESS OF LAW UNDER THE FIFTH AMENDMENT TO THE
UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.

65. Plaintiffs incorporate as though restated each of the factual
allegations stated in paragraphs 1 through 64 above.

66. Mr. Jamal and the Prison Radio Project have the rights under the
due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States
Constitution not to be deprived of liberty or property without due
process of law, and not to be subjected to arbitrary or capricious
government action.

67. As a result of their express contractual agreement with NPR,
plaintiffs had a crystallized and reasonably justifiable expectation that
they would enjoy the benefit of having their work broadcast on
NPR's "All Things Considered" program.

68. Mr. Jamal had a significant liberty interest not to be denied by
the government the right to express his political viewpoints on an
arbitrary or capricious basis.

69. Plaintiffs' rights not to be treated in an arbitrary and capricious
manner by government actors were clearly established under the Fifth
Amendment to the Constitution and judicial precedent at all times
relevant to this complaint.

70. Defendants' actions in refusing to broadcast Mr. Jamal's
commentaries were arbitrary, capricious, and without reasonable
basis.

71. Defendants' actions in refusing to broadcast Mr. Jamal's
commentaries were taken with reckless indifference to, and in willful
and wanton disregard of, plaintiffs' rights, and directly and
proximately caused plaintiffs injury, including the loss of opportunity
to communicate with the audience of "All Things Considered," the
loss of opportunities to seek other broadcast outlets for the
commentaries, and damage to the professional reputations of Mr.
Jamal and the Prison Radio  Project.

72. Defendants' violation of plaintiffs' fundamental constitutional
right to due process caused them substantial harm.

COUNT FOUR --  BREACH OF CONTRACT AND BREACH OF
THE COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING.

73. Plaintiffs incorporate as though restated each of the factual
allegations stated in paragraphs 1 through 72 above.

74. The promises exchanged in February 1994 between NPR and
Noelle Hanrahan, who was acting on behalf of the Prison Radio
Project and Mr. Jamal, established an express contract between
NPR, the Prison Radio Project and Mr. Jamal.

75. Under the terms of the above-described contract, the Prison
Radio Project agreed to produce broadcast quality audio recordings
of Mr. Jamal's commentaries produced in the Huntington Prison on
April 15, 1994. Mr. Jamal agreed to write several new commentaries
and to permit NPR to select a number of commentaries from among
those he had already composed, to deliver the selected and
commissioned commentaries orally for recording by Prison Radio
Project on April 15, 1994, and to permit NPR to broadcast the
commentaries according to its usual and customary format and
scheduling of commentaries on the "All Things Considered"
program.

76. In exchange for the promises made by Mr. Jamal and the Prison
Radio project, NPR promised to send an engineer and producer to
SCI Huntingdon on April 15, 1994, to assist the Prison Radio
Project in recording Mr. Jamal delivering the commentaries that it had
chosen and/or commissioned from Mr. Jamal, to pay Mr. Jamal the
usual and customary fee for Commentators on "All Things
Considered," and to broadcast the recorded commentaries on the "All
Things Considered" program at the rate of one Commentary per
month for at least six months.

77. In agreeing to these arrangements, the Prison Radio Project and
Mr. Jamal relied on NPR's promises that its decision whether to air
the commentaries would be based solely on an evaluation of the
technical quality of the commentaries and would not be influenced by
or based upon the facts that Mr. Jamal is on death row, that he has
been convicted of killing a police officer, or that he was a
controversial public figure.

78. By the end of the day on April 15, 1994, the Prison Radio
Project and Mr. Jamal performed all of their obligations under their
contract with NPR.

79. The commentaries that were produced and recorded on April 15,
1994, satisfied any and all requirements and/or conditions that NPR
had asserted with respect to its technical sound quality requirements.
Once NPR determined that the audio tapes satisfied its technical
requirements, NPR came under a duty pursuant to the contract
between it and Mr. Jamal and the Prison Radio Project to broadcast
the commentaries on the "All Things Considered" program.

80. Defendants' decision on May 15, 1994, not to broadcast Mr.
Jamal's commentaries because of disagreements on the part of the
National and Philadelphia Chapters of the Fraternal Order of Police,
Senator Dole, and others, with the political viewpoints that Mr. Jamal
had previously expressed, and the political viewpoints Mr. Jamal
symbolized, constituted a willful, malicious, and bad faith breach of
its obligations under the terms of the express contract between NPR,
Mr. Jamal, and the Prison Radio Project, and also constituted a
breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

81. NPR's refusal to broadcast the commentaries as promised was
in willful and wanton disregard of plaintiffs' contractual rights, and
directly and proximately caused Mr. Jamal and the Prison Radio
Project injury, including the loss of the unique opportunity to air Mr.
Jamal's views to the "All Things Considered" audience, the loss of
opportunities to market Mr. Jamal's commentaries to other broadcast
outlets, and damage to the professional reputations of Mr. Jamal and
the Prison Radio Project.

82. Monetary damages cannot fairly compensate plaintiffs for the
wrongful denial of an opportunity to communicate their views to the
audience of "All Things Considered," as NPR promised, since such
an opportunity is a unique and irreplaceable benefit of the parties'
contractual agreement for which no comparable market substitute is
available. Monetary damages cannot adequately compensate
plaintiffs for the harm they have suffered and continue to suffer as a
result of defendants' wrongful actions.

COUNT FIVE --  CONVERSION

83. Plaintiff incorporates as though restated each of the factual
allegations stated in paragraphs 1 through 82 above.

84. Mr. Jamal and the Prison Radio Project have a property interest
in the nature of a common law or statutory copyright in Mr. Jamal's
unique delivery of his commentaries.

85. The audio tapes in the possession of NPR represent the only
embodiments of the creative and artistic expression of Mr. Jamal in
delivering the commentaries that are the subject of this suit.

86. On its own behalf and on behalf of Mr. Jamal, the Prison Radio
Project has repeatedly requested of NPR that the tapes, or copies
thereof, be returned to the Prison Radio Project and/or Mr. Jamal.

87. Defendants have willfully refused to return the audio tapes or
copies thereof to plaintiffs and continue to wrongfully detain the
property, which denies and repudiates the lawful rights of plaintiffs
to ownership and possession of the commentaries.

88. Defendants' actions in converting the property of plaintiffs to
their own use and refusing plaintiffs access to their property, in
willful and wanton disregard of plaintiffs' property rights, has
directly and proximately caused plaintiffs injury, including the denial
of any opportunity to broadcast the commentaries embodied in the
audio tapes by alternative means.

Requested Relief

NOW, WHEREFORE, plaintiff prays this court for the following
relief:

1. Issuance of a declaratory judgment declaring that defendants'
suppression of Mr. Jamal's political expression violates his
constitutional right to free speech under the First Amendment to the
United States Constitution and plaintiffs' rights to due process under
the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution;

2. Issuance of an order enjoining defendants NPR, Drake and
Buzenberg from suppressing Mr. Jamal's political views and
requiring that they broadcast the commentaries at issue in this suit on
NPR's "All Things Considered" program, at the frequency and times
of day that it originally planned, prior to NPR's censorship of his
views;

3. Issuance of an order enjoining defendants NPR, Drake and
Buzenberg from retaining the audio tapes of Mr. Jamal's
commentaries and requiring that NPR immediately return the audio
tapes, or broadcast quality copies thereof, to plaintiffs;

4. An award to plaintiffs of compensatory and consequential
damages in an amount appropriate to the proof presented at trial, but
in no event less than $500.000:

5. An award to plaintiffs of punitive damages in the amount of
$1,500,000;

6. Granting of specific performance of NPR's promise to broadcast
the commentaries at issue in this suit on NPR's "All Things
Considered" program, at the frequency and times of day that it
originally planned, prior to its censorship of his views;

<h2>Penalty Phase - Week 3</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from April 8 - 12.</P>

<P>APRIL 8<BR>
Turmoil and chaos continued in the penalty phase of the trial as Erik Menendez and his attorneys met privately with the judge in an apparent effort to determine the fate of Leslie Abramson and her role in the case.</P>

<P>The public, prosecutors and even Lyle Menendez and his lawyers were excluded at the request of Abramson co-counsel Barry Levin. He asked for the hearing to discuss what he called matters of "dire urgency and extreme privilege."</P>

<P>The controversy erupted after psychiatrist Dr. William Vicary, who has treated Erik since his arrest, admitted last week that he altered notes of those sessions at the direction of Abramson. </P>

<P>At a subsequent hearing, Abramson invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege not to incriminate herself and refused to answer Judge Stanley Weisberg's  questions about the possible misconduct.</P>

<P>On Monday, it is almost certain that the lawyers discussed whether Abramson should be removed from the case and whether Erik should have independent counsel. Judge Weisberg apparently has appointed a Woodland Hills criminal defense attorney, Bruce Hill, who confirmed that he is working independently for the court. Hill spent the afternoon in the courtroom with Erik and his attorneys.</P>

<P>Levin previously said that he would advise Erik to fire Abramson in order to distance himself from any appearance of misconduct. It was unclear what position Erik took during the hearing Monday.</P>

<P>It is hard to imagine the Menendez trial without Abramson. She has been at Erik's side since his arraignment six years ago when he was only 19 years old. She has professed that she considers him more than a client and was devastated by the jury's verdict finding him and his brother guilty of first-degree murder in the 1989 slayings of their parents.</P>

<P>Abramson's fate could be decided Tuesday. When the penalty phase continues, prosecutor David Conn will continue to attack Dr. Vicary's credibility.</P>

<P>APRIL 9<BR>
Defense attorney Leslie Abramson will remain on the case, despite a psychiatrist's  testimony that she ordered him to alter his notes.</P>

<P>Judge Stanley Weisberg ruled late Tuesday that there was no conflict of interest between Erik Menendez and Abramson that would require her removal from the trial. It was clear that even after her fellow attorneys on the case fought to get Abramson removed, Erik had the last word. He spoke to the judge behind closed doors for about 20 minutes. Immediately afterward, Judge Weisberg ruled that Abramson will be with him until the conclusion of the trial.</P>

<P>The judge also denied motions for a mistrial. He ruled Lyle Menendez did not have any grounds for a mistrial based on Abramson's ineffective assistance of counsel because she is not his lawyer. The judge said he would instruct the jurors not to consider Abramson's alleged actions of misconduct when deciding whether the brothers should be sentenced to death or life in prison for murdering their parents.</P>

<P>Despite the judge's rulings, Abramson troubles are far from over. She'll probably face a state bar investigation and some lawyers say possible criminal charges.</P>

<P>The controversy erupted last week when psychiatrist Dr. William Vicary, who has treated Erik since his arrest, admitted that he altered notes of those sessions at the direction of Abramson.</P>

<P>At a subsequent hearing, Abramson invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege not to incriminate herself and refused to answer Judge Weisberg's  questions about the possible misconduct. On Tuesday, Abramson withdrew her invocation of the privilege, but then refused to speak in open court and told Judge Weisberg that she would answer his questions only behind closed doors. The judge refused and did not re-ask the questions he asked Friday.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, the judge issued several key rulings on what the jury will hear about Dr. Vicary's notes, what was deleted and why. He said the prosecution can not elicit in front of the jury that Abramson asked him to alter his notes. He directed prosecutors to try and impeach Dr. Vicary's testimony without making any references to Abramson. But, the judge ruled that Dr. Vicary's revelation in front of the jury last week that Abramson directed him to change his notes would not be stricken from the court record.</P>

<P>As Dr. Vicary testified about what was deleted from the original notes, it was clear that Lyle and Erik may be damaged much more severely by the information in the original notes than by the appearance of misconduct by Abramson.</P>

<P>Among the items deleted from the original notes that Judge Weisberg will allow the jury to hear about:</P>

<P>@ Erik's statement that he hated his parents and wanted them out of his life.</P>

<P>@ The conversations the brothers had a week before the killings about what it would be like to live without their parents. ,p></P>

<P>@ Erik statement about a fight with his parents. He said his mother took his father's side. He said he hated his mother.</P>

<P>The judge still must decide whether the jury will hear about references to Erik's homosexuality.</P>

<P>According to Dr. Vicary's original notes, Erik had homosexual experiences when he was 11, 12 and 16 years old. Asked by Judge Weisberg about why the information was relevant, prosecutor David Conn said, "it puts the allegations of sexual assault (by his father) in a new perspective." </P>

<P>Prosecutors have been trying for years to present evidence that Erik is gay. The state argues that Erik could have fabricated his story based on details of his homosexual relationships.</P>

<P>The state also wants Dr. Vicary to testify about a section in his notes in which he reveals that Erik was raped by a male baby-sitter when he was five years old. The defense has argued that Erik's personality changed when he was a young boy -- he went from being happy and loving to introverted and sad. Conn now wants to argue that the change was caused by the baby-sitter rape -- not the abuse by his father.</P>

<P>The judge is expected to rule on these issues Wednesday before the jury resumes hearing testimony.</P>

<P>APRIL 10<BR>
Just a day after the penalty phase of the Menendez brothers trial teetered on the brink of disaster, both sides rested their cases and closing arguments were set to begin.</P>

<P>The state will makes its closing argument first Thursday. When it's the defense's turn, attorney Leslie Abramson will ask the jury not to hold her client responsible for any appearance of misconduct on her part. She'll then let co-counsel Barry Levin deliver the closing argument for Erik Menendez. He'll be followed by Lyle's attorney Charles Gessler.</P>

<P>On Wednesday, defense witness  Dr. William Vicary concluded his testimony. The psychiatrist testified that he altered his notes of  his sessions with Erik. But he was not allowed to tell the jury that he did so at Abramson's request. </P>

<P>Dr. Vicary admitted that the deleted information was damaging to Erik and Lyle. The deleted sections included notes about conversations the brothers had a week before the killings about what it would be like to live without their parents. Also included were notes which detailed Erik's statements that he hated his parents and wanted them out of his life. </P>

<P>Judge Stanley Weisberg did not allow prosecutors to introduce evidence from the notes that Erik had homosexual relations when he was 11, 12 and 16 years old, and that he was raped by a male baby-sitter when he was five-years-old. Prosecutor David Conn argued that because Erik had homosexual experiences, he could not have been so traumatized by his father molesting him. </P>

<P>Under re-direct examination, Dr. Vicary admitted that he should not have doctored his notes, but said he never committed perjury and that his role was still "to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth."</P>

<P>After Dr. Vicary's testimony, the state presented three rebuttal witnesses:  a detective and Kitty Menendez's two brothers, Milton and Brian Andersen. They testified about how they remembered their sister and how devastated they were when she was taken from them.</P>

<P>"She was a beautiful person, " Milton Andersen said. "She always had a special care for people. family and myself."</P>

<P>Brian Andersen broke down in tears as he testified about the nightmares he has about the murders. He said he would wake up in the middle of the night screaming, thinking that his sister was alive during much of the shooting spree. </P>

<P>"I dream of her all the time. I miss her...It's not been easy, especially knowing how she died," he said.</P>

<P>During his testimony, prosecutors introduced a videotape of Andersen, Erik, Jose and Kitty Menendez, taken nine days before the killings. The scene was of a happy, healthy family on a family trip. Everyone was smiling, waving at the camera and talking to each other. Erik waved at the cameras and said, "hello everyone out there in TV land." The last thing Kitty said before the camera was turned off was, "here were are -- all safe."</P>

<P>APRIL 11<BR>
Lyle and Erik Menendez were born with silver spoons in their mouths but are just as eligible for the death penalty as people from poor neighborhoods, prosecutor David Conn told jurors during the first day of closing arguments in the penalty phase of the trial.</P>

<P>Conn argued that the brothers should be sentenced to death because they chose to kill their parents in a horrifying brutal way. At one point, he presented a large illustration showing a scale weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances. On the aggravating side, a gory crime scene photograph was displayed. On the mitigation side, were the words, "too much tennis. Not enough hugs." </P>

<P>Conn proceeded to ridicule the defense allegations of psychological abuse, calling them desperate and trivial. "You should reject this country club excuse," he told the jury.</P>

<P>Erik's lawyer Barry Levin began his closing argument by attacking the Los Angeles District Attorney's office -- accusing it of arbitrarily deciding who should be eligible for the death penalty. He reminded jurors of the brutal murders of  Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman and said, "what about OJ. He's not even eligible for the death penalty."</P>

<P>Levin's argument was extremely emotional. He stormed around the courtroom, yelling, putting his hands on Erik's shoulders and pointing at prosecutors. He told the jury that prosecutors did not present any evidence of aggravating circumstances other than the crime itself.</P>

<P>"What Mr. Conn is telling you to do is kill them because they're really, really, guilty," he said. "You cannot bring back Kitty and Jose Menendez by killing their sons."</P>

<P>In explaining what jurors can consider when deliberating the fate of the brothers, Levin said, "you cannot be mad at Erik Menendez and give him death. You cannot hate Erik Menendez's life and give him death ... You are leaders of Erik Menendez's life and if you feel any compassion this is the time to use it. If you feel any mercy, this is the time to use it."</P>

<P>APRIL 12<BR>
After a marathon day of emotional closing arguments, the question of whether Lyle and Erik Menendez should be sentenced to life or death went to the jury.</P>

<P>The jury must decide separate verdicts for each brother. It also must return verdicts on each victim. </P>

<P>Once a verdict is reached, defense attorneys can ask the judge to change a sentence of death to life in prison. The judge can not change a life verdict to death.</P>

<P>The attorneys made their final pleas to jurors -- prosecutors for death, defense attorneys for life. But Leslie Abramson, who has represented Erik Menendez since his arrest, did not say anything. After possibly having lost her credibility because of allegations that she asked an expert defense witness to change his notes, she let co-counsel Barry Levin make the final argument.</P>

<P>Levin argued that Erik's life should be spared because he did not have a prior history of violent crime or felony convictions and because he was sorry for his crimes. </P>

<P>"Erik Menendez will spend the rest of his life locked in a cell the size of your bathroom," Levin told the jury. ``He will spend the next 50 or 60 years there until he dies."</P>

<P>He urged the jury to take into consideration that Erik was only 18 when he killed his parents. ``Would any of us want to be judged by a decision we made at 18 years old?" he asked the jury.</P>

<P>Lyle's attorneys, Terry Towery and Charles Gessler, described their client's childhood, saying he was a scared kid who was not allowed to cry or show any emotion. They said he lived under the constant pressure to succeed at any cost.</P>

<P>At the end of his argument, an emotional Gessler seemed about to break down in tears. He walked over and squeezed Lyle's shoulders and asked the jury to spare his life. </P>

<P>"Lyle Menendez will spend the rest of his life in prison," Gessler said. "But at least no one will ever again tell Lyle Menendez that you have to be No. 1."</P>

<P>Prosecutor David Conn reminded jurors that Lyle once said he misses his parents but he also misses his dog. Conn demonstrated how he believes Lyle straddled his dying mother, leaned down close to her and fired one last shot through her  see face.</P>

<P>"Look at those eyes," Conn said, walking toward Lyle and pointing at him. "You see black eyes, dead eyes. And they should be dead."</P>

<h2>Penalty Phase: Week 2</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from April 1-5.</P>

<P>APRIL 1<BR>
The sister of Jose Menendez said she wishes she'd  told authorities that her brother and his wife were psychologically abusing their children. Marta Cano told the jury that Lyle and Erik would not be in court today is she had reported the abuse. </P>

<P>Cano also testified that it would further destroy the already heartbroken family if the brothers are sentenced to death by lethal injection. </P>

<P>Her testimony was followed by that of her former husband, who is one of the only eyewitnesses to the allegations of physical abuse in the Menendez home. </P>

<P>Peter Cano testified that he saw Jose punch 5-year-old Lyle in the stomach for wetting his pants. And when Lyle was 11 years old, Cano said that Jose kicked him out of the car and made him walk home after losing a tennis match. Cano said he confronted Jose about the incidents but Jose told him it was none of his business.</P>

<P>Peter Cano's testimony was excluded from the guilt phase of the retrial, even though it was allowed in the first trial. Judge Stanley Weisberg ruled the incidents were irrelevant since Lyle did not take the witness stand and therefore the defense could not link what happened to him as a child to his state of mind at the time of the murders.</P>

<P>APRIL 2<BR>
After several days of testimony from Menendez family members and friends of the brothers, the defense introduced medical testimony about the psychological abuse of children.</P>

<P>The jury heard from Dr. Stuart Hart, a professor of educational psychology at the University of Indiana. He testified about the effects of psychological mistreatment of children, telling the jurors that psychological abuse often is often worse  than physical abuse because it happens every day.</P>

<P>He said Kitty and Jose Menendez rejected and terrorized their children, kept them away from friends and failed to show any signs of affection, such as hugging and cuddling. Hart testified about some specific incidents, in which he said Erik was psychologically mistreated. But he did not give specific examples of Lyle's abuse.</P>

<P>Hart went on to say that Erik has changed in positive ways since his arrest in 1990. However, he was not asked the same question about Lyle.  That's probably because of the evidence discovered against Lyle since his arrest. The evidence included suspected escape plans found in his jail cell and letters he wrote two people telling them how to testify.  If Hart had testified that Lyle is capable of changing in positive ways, the prosecution would have introduced these incidents on cross-examination.</P>

<P>APRIL 3<BR>
A Catholic priest testified Wednesday for the defense in the penalty phase of the Menendez trial and spoke of Erik as having been distraught since the killing of his parents.</P>

<P>Father Ken Deasy, who met the family a year before the murders, has been visiting Erik in jail a few times a month since his arrest.  Erik confessed killing his parents to the priest in 1990.  According to Father Deasy, he did so because he was afraid of them, his  parents abused him, and his father molested him.</P>

<P>Erik questioned the priest about the chances that his parents or God could ever forgive him for taking the life of his parents.  "Do not limit God's forgiveness to our own inability to forgive." Father Deasy said he told Erik. God gives "unconditional love" he said, echoing a central theme of the approaching Catholic holiday of Easter.</P>

<P>But Father Deasy did not mention Lyle Menendez, and it is unclear why Lyle's attorneys opted not to question him. A "gag order" imposed by Judge Stanley Weisberg prevents lawyers from commenting on the trial outside of court until after the penalty phase.</P>

<P>APRIL 4<BR>
The illustrious defense lawyer Leslie Abramson may have lost all credibility with the jurors who must decide between life and death for her client, Erik Menendez.</P>

<P>In a stunning courtroom moment, the psychiatrist who has treated Erik Menendez since his arrest admitted that he doctored his notes of those sessions at the direction of Abramson. Dr. William Vicary conceded under cross-examination that he omitted from his notes an entire section containing possibly incriminating statements by Erik Menendez.</P>

<P>It happened when prosecutor David Conn asked Vicary whether Erik told him: "A week prior [to the killings] he [Erik] had conversations about what it would be like to live without his parents." Vicary said that his notes did not say that. Defense attorneys asked for a page cite. Conn approached the witness stand to compare his notes with Vicary's and realized that Vicary's notes were different. Conn demanded to know why.</P>

<P>Said Vicary, "I did rewrite that page and left out that section at the request of defense counsel." </P>

<P>Conn asked, "Who requested that?"</P>

<P>Vicary replied, "Leslie Abramson. . . . She said this was prejudicial and out of bounds." </P>

<P>People throughout the courtroom seemed shocked -- spectators, reporters, prosecutors and jurors. </P>

<P>Conn continued his line of questioning. He got Vicary to admit that Erik once told him his father's homosexual lover came to the Menendez house two days before the killings and told the brothers their parents were going to kill them. Vicary testified that Erik later told him that was a lie. But Erik's admission that he had lied does not appear in Vicary's notes. And it is still unclear whether that section also was omitted from Vicary's original notes. That question most likely will be answered on Friday, when Conn is expected to continue his cross-examination of Vicary.</P>

<P>Shortly after the incident, Judge Weisberg recessed court for lunch. After lunch the defense met with the judge in a closed courtroom without prosecutors. Later, prosecutors were admitted into the courtroom but the public remained outside. An hour later a bailiff informed everyone that court would be in recess for the rest of the day.</P>

<P>This incident could have major ramifications. Abramson will no doubt lose credibility with the jury. She may now be facing questions such as whether to continue as Erik's counsel; whether her co-counsel, Barry Levin, will conclude the penalty phase; and whether she can deliver a closing argument to this jury, which may have lost all confidence in her and her client.</P>

<P>Furthermore, Lyle Menendez's case may have been severely prejudiced by something over which he had no control. Surely Lyle's lawyers will ask for some sort of jury admonishment which would separate him from the incident. But he may already be damaged, as the jury could paint the brothers with the same brush. In the past, Lyle's attorney, Charlie Gessler, has repeatedly renewed his motion for separate trials. If he hasn't done so already (in the closed hearing), he most likely will ask again. This would be a huge appeal issue for the defense, which has urged the judge since the beginning that their clients could have fair trials only if they were tried separately.</P>

<P>Abramson would not speak to reporters outside the courthouse. She, like the other lawyers in the case, is under a gag order by the judge. </P>

<P>Prosecutors now have copies of the original notes and the doctored notes. They are expected to quiz Vicary on Friday about any other omissions or alterations they can find. </P>

<P>Notwithstanding the fact that Vicary doctored his notes, the notes themselves contain possibly incriminating evidence against Erik. For example: Erik said Jose Menendez forbade him to attend a tennis camp four days before the killings. The notes say Erik complained that his father refused to continue paying for his tennis instruction and would not let him take a drama class. One of the first things Erik did after killing his parents was to hire a private tennis coach. The notes also say Erik told Vicary that "Lyle Menendez said wait a week and he [Erik] said I can't let another week go by."</P>

<P>APRIL 5<BR>
Defense lawyer Leslie  Abramson invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege not to incriminate herself and refused to answer Judge Stanley Weisberg's  questions about possible misconduct.</P>

<P>On her lawyer's advice, Abramson refused to answer two questions  about a set of notes, which she allegedly ordered a psychiatrist  to alter and then turned over to prosecutors. Judge Weisberg asked her which copy of the notes she had turned over to prosecutors in 1993 -- the original or the doctored version -- and why there were redactions in the notes. Abramson responded to both questions, "I assert the privilege."</P>

<P>On Thursday the psychiatrist, Dr. William Vicary, who has  treated Erik Menendez since his arrest, admitted that he doctored his notes of those sessions at the direction of  Abramson.</P>

<P>After a marathon day of hearings outside the jury's presence, Judge Weisberg rejected motions for mistrials for both brothers on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of Abramson. Weisberg ruled that Lyle Menendez could not make such an argument because Abramson is not his lawyer. The judge also ruled that Abramson's co-counsel, Barry Levin, is perfectly  capable of taking over Erik's case.</P>

<P>Before taking the Fifth, Abramson said her main concern -- her  ethical obligation -- is to assure that Erik gets a fair trial. "Whether I have committed misconduct or not is irrelevant," she said.  She added that that is something to be dealt with another time and in another forum, "soon."</P>

<P>The judge pointed out that jurors would be instructed not to hold Abramson's actions against the brothers. But attorneys for both sides said their clients already were irreparably prejudiced and could not continue to get a fair trial from this point on.</P>

<P>Lyle Menendez's attorney, Charlie Gessler, was especially upset, saying he never even knew there were two sets of the psychiatrist's notes until Thursday. He also said he did not want Abramson to put Vicary on the stand in the first place. But Weisberg pointed out that Gessler never formally objected to Vicary's testimony.</P>

<P>Gessler complained that if Lyle had had a separate trial, none of this damaging evidence ever would have come in. He said the jury deciding whether Lyle should live or die is now unfairly contaminated with the appearance of "misconduct, tampering with evidence, or manufacturing a defense." He said it may appear to jurors that Lyle is "part of an effort to manufacture a defense."</P>

<P>On Friday, prosecutors came to court with the answer to one of Weisberg's questions: David Conn said that Abramson in 1993 turned over to prosecutors the redacted version of the notes. That is the copy prosecutors have had for three years. About two months ago prosecutors needed to review the notes but had left them somewhere in their offices downtown. So they got a copy from Dr. Park Dietz, their psychiatric expert, who had received a copy included in a big box of materials from the defense. (By the way, when Dietz testified at the trial, he admitted on the stand that he had never read Vicary's notes.) Somehow, Dietz had a copy of the originals. Prosecutors allege that Abramson turned over the originals by accident, and had it not been for this slip, no one ever would have noticed the discrepancy.</P>

<P>Even if the jury does not consider Abramson's actions when making its decision, both brothers may suffer. That's because the newly discovered original notes contain possibly incriminating evidence.</P>

<P>One section says that a week prior to the killings, Erik was talking about what it would be like to live without his parents. (Vicary testified Friday that those conversations were with Lyle.) Of course, the defense could easily have argued that what they meant was what it would be like to live at college, away from home. But here's the problem: Vicary testified that Abramson told him to delete it because it was "too prejudicial."</P>

<P>Another section says Erik and Lyle were discussing doing something "drastic." According to the notes, Lyle wanted to wait a week, but Erik said he could not let another week go by. The notes do not specify what "drastic" referred to.</P>

<P>Still another deleted section says Erik told Vicary that Jose Menendez's homosexual lover came to the house two days before the killings and told the brothers that their parents were going to kill them. Vicary testified that Erik later admitted that was a lie.</P>

<h2>Penalty Phase - Week 1</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from March 27 - 29.</P>

<P>MARCH 27<BR>
The penalty phase of the trial opened with Erik and Lyle Menendez's aunt tearfully pleading with the jury to spare her nephews' lives.</P>

<P>Teresita Baralt said Jose and Kitty Menendez were her best friends but that she did not agree with how the couple raised their children. She said they were too hard on  their sons in sports and school and never showed any affection towards Lyle and Erik.</P>

<P>"I can't see how nobody can see why it happened," said Baralt, the sister of  Jose Menendez. "There have to be powerful reasons for it to have happened. These kids are not killers." She said that executing the brothers would mean the "wiping out ...the destruction of the rest of my family."</P> 

<P>Erik, 25, and Lyle, 28, were convicted last week of first-degree murder in the 1989 shooting deaths of Jose and Kitty Menendez.  The jury of eight men and four women now must decided whether they should be sentenced to life in prison without parole or death by lethal injection.</P>

<P>Baralt's testimony followed opening statements by both sides in the case.</P>

<P>Deputy District Attorney David Conn, in brief remarks, told the jury that the circumstances of the murders were aggravating enough to send the brothers to death row.</P>

<P>During her opening statement, defense attorney Leslie Abramson  seemed angry and almost defeated. She told jurors that she did not what to say since they already had rejected her arguments during the guilt phase of the trial. </P>

<P>She said he job now was not a lawyer's job, but God's job. And they don't teach you about that in law school. At that point, Judge Stanley Wesiberg interrupted Abramson and told her to stick to the evidence in the case.</P>

<P>Abramson ended her statement by saying that four lives have been destroyed, no matter what the jury decides. </P>

<P>"I think you'll find more grief is not necessary," she said.</P>

<P>MARCH 28<BR>
In a heated and highly emotional confrontation, Jose Menendez's sister berated prosecutors for seeking the death penalty against her nephews.</P>

<P>"I wanted to save these two boys. You wanted them dead," Teresita Baralt told prosecutor David Conn. "You're getting what you wanted. Now you want me to sit back and say okay."</P>

<P>Earlier, Conn had attacked Baralt for not cooperating with the prosecution's effort to portray Kitty and Jose Menendez in a positive light. </P>

<P>Baralt testified that the family was devastated by the murders, but felt even worse when Lyle and Erik were convicted last week of first-degree murder. She said sentencing the brothers to death would cause more grief to a family already grieving.</P>

<P>"The family members do not want any more blood. This is our family, not your family," she said. And I'm the one that's hurting, not you."</P>

<P>Baralt is among several Menendez family members who have supported the brothers since their arrests for the August 1989 slayings of their parents in the family's Beverly Hills home. But she insisted that she would not lie for them.</P>

<P>"If I lie here, I will have to go back and look my kids in the face. I don't lie," she said. </P>

<P>Baralt and her husband, Carlos, were close with Jose and Kitty Menendez when the two families lived in New Jersey and New York during the 1970s and '80s.</P>

<P>In other testimony,  Lyle and Erik's former tennis coach, Charles Wadlington , told jurors that Jose  worked his children too hard on the tennis courts because he wanted them to become nothing less than national champions.</P>

<P>"He said winning was everything. Finishing second was like kissing your sister," Wadlington said, adding  he told Jose that he should not push his sons so hard because they might crack under the pressure.</P>

<P>"He got in my face and said, `You're naive, and you don't know what you're talking about, and you're fired, " Wadlington said.</P>

<P>MARCH 29<BR>
The defense continued to present testimony to show that Lyle and Erik Menendez were troubled young boys who grew up in constant fear of their parents.</P>

<P>The witnesses testified during the first trial but were barred from testifying during the guilt phase of the retrial by Judge Stanley Weisberg.</P>

<P>The first witness was Jessica Goldsmith, a childhood friend of the brothers. She told the jury about the time that 8-year-old Lyle got stuck hanging from a beam. Instead of helping his son down, Jose Menendez poked Lyle in the stomach and said, "you'll stay up there until you learn to be a man, until you learn not to cry," according to Goldsmith.</P>

<P>The brothers' cousin, Alan Andersen, told the jury that Jose tried to teach 6-year-old Erik how to ride a bicycle by forcing him on the bike and pushing him down a slope. Andersen said that after Erik cried, fell down and hurt his leg and elbow, Jose forced him back on the bike and down the hill over and over again.</P>

<P>Bonnie Hunter, one of Erik's teachers, testified that he would cry in class in the 9th grade when the teacher announced a test or if he got a poor grade. Hunter said Erik was the most nervous and anxious student she had during her 30 years as an English teacher.</P>

<P>Sandra Sharp, the brothers' high school Spanish teacher, then testified that Lyle seemed anxious about his grades and once told her that "my father will kill me if I don't make the headmaster's list." Sharp also said Erik had learning disabilities but that his parents refused to deal with them.</P>

<h2>Trial Summary: Week 23</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from March 18 - 22.</P>

<P>MARCH 18<BR>
The jury deliberated for a full day without reaching a verdict.</P>

<P>MARCH 19<BR>
The jury deliberated quietly for five and a half hours.</P>

<P>MARCH 20<BR>
The jury finds the brothers guilty of first-degree murder.</P>

<P>MARCH 22<BR>
The sentencing phase of the trial was delayed until Wednesday.  It was set to start Monday but Judge Stanley Weisberg granted a delay after defense attorneys asked for more time to bring in out-of-town witnesses. </P>

<P>Erik, 25, and Lyle, 28, were convicted earlier this week of first-degree murder of Jose and Kitty Menendez, conspiracy and special circumstances which make them eligible for the death penalty.</P>
 
<P>The jury of eight men and four women will recommend either death or life in prison without possibility of parole. The judge will make the final decision.</P>
 
<P>Defense attorney Leslie Abramson has said the penalty phase could last two months. Defense attorneys have said they plan to call 40 witnesses. It is hard to say who will testify because the judge issued a gag order on all the attorneys and witnesses until the penalty phase is completed. But, it is almost certain that the defense will try to call all the witnesses that the judge precluded it from calling during the trial. The witnesses included friends, family members, teachers and coaches of the brothers, who are expected to testify about allegations of physical, sexual and emotional abuse suffered by the brothers at the hands of their parents.</P>

<h2>Trial Summary: Week 22</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from March 11-15, 1996.</P>

<P>MARCH 11<BR>
The jury deliberated for a fifth day without reaching a verdict.</P>

<P>MARCH 12<BR>
Jurors deliberated for about five hours. They asked to see several exhibits including photographs of the Menendez home in Beverly Hills.</P>

<P>MARCH 13<BR>
After seven days of deliberations, there still is no verdict. And in the past three days, the jury has not asked to re-hear any testimony or asked any questions.</P>

<P>MARCH 14<BR>
The jury deliberations must start all over again.</P>

<P>That's because Judge Stanley Weisberg removed two female jurors, including the foreperson, from the case because of medical emergencies. The court did not release any additional information about the jurors' medical conditions.</P>

<P>The jurors were replaced by one male and one female. The jury now consists of eight men and four women. There are two remaining alternates, both men.</P>

<P>Judge Weisberg told the new panel that it must "set aside and disregard all past deliberations and begin anew." The jury selected a new foreperson and deliberated for several hours in the afternoon. </P>

<P>MARCH 15<BR>
The new jury panel of eight men and four women concluded its first full day of deliberations without reaching a verdict..</P>

<P>Judge Stanley Weisberg reminded the panel that it must begin its deliberations anew, after the jurors asked if they could consider written material they had prepared during the earlier deliberations.  The jury had deliberated for seven days before two female jurors were removed Thursday from the panel because of medical emergencies.</P>

<P>It turns out that the former foreperson was removed because she suffered a heart attack. The other juror was removed because she went into premature labor.</P>

<h2>Trial Summary - Week 21</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from March 4 - March 8, 1996.</P>

<P>MARCH 4<BR>
The jury deliberated for its first full day without reaching a verdict in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez. So far, the jury has deliberated for nine hours -- three on Friday and six on Monday.</P>

<P>The jury must reach verdicts on three counts for each brother:  two counts of murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder. Also, there are two special circumstances -- lying in wait and multiple murder.</P>

<P>If the jury finds the brothers guilty of first-degree murder, it will have to decide the special circumstances of lying in wait -- whether the murders were committed after a period of waiting and watching for an advantageous moment to take the victims by surprise. In other words, an ambush. </P>

<P>If the jury convicts either brother of first-degree murder on one count and at least second-degree murder on another count, then multiple murder automatically applies.</P>

<P>If one or both special circumstances are found for either or both brothers, the jury will have to return for a penalty phase to determine whether to recommend a sentence of life in prison without parole, or death. Defense attorneys estimate a penalty phase would take two to three months, during which they would call about 40 witnesses.</P>

<P>MARCH 5<BR>
The jury deliberated for six hours without reaching a verdict.</P>

<P>MARCH 6<BR>
After nearly 21 hours of deliberations, the jury still has not reached a verdict in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez.</P>

<P>On Wednesday, the jurors asked for a readback of the following parts of Erik's testimony:</P>

<P>@ Erik's testimony about his activities from the Thursday night before the August 20, 1989 shootings, when Jose Menendez allegedly assaulted him and threatened his life, and the following day, when he and his brother went to San Diego to buy shotguns.</P>

<P>@ Erik's testimony regarding his alleged attempt to buy handguns at a Santa Monica sporting goods store before going to San Diego for the shotguns. Erik testified that he and Lyle tried to buy handguns for protection from their parents because handguns are easier to conceal. But prosecutors contend that Erik lied because the store where he said he tried to buy the weapons had stopped selling handguns two years earlier.</P>

<P>@ Erik's testimony regarding where he got the money to buy the shotguns. Erik said he kept some cash in his Peter Rabbit book.</P>

<P>Outside court, prosecutor David Conn said he though the readback selections suggested the jury was thinking about the elements of premeditation and not abuse and fear. Defense attorneys declined to speculate on the jury's activities.</P>

<P>"I don't read tea leaves," said Leslie Abramson.</P>

<P>MARCH 7<BR>
The jury did not meet because a juror was ill.</P>

<P>MARCH 8<BR>
The jury did not meet because a juror was ill.</P>

<h2>Trial Summary: Week 20</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from Feb. 26 - March 1, 1996.</P>

<P>FEBRUARY 26<BR>
In a scathing attack of the prosecution, defense attorney Leslie Abramson accused David Conn of presenting fraudulent witnesses in an effort to win the case for "political reasons."</P>

<P>At one point during the first day of her closing arguments, Abramson exploded and began pounding the podium and screaming insults at prosecutors for calling the defense witness liars.</P>

<P>"The prosecution's basic posture is that everyone who testified for the defense is a liar," she said. Then, gesturing to members of the Menendez family sitting in the courtroom behind the defendants, she said, "they are not liars. They are the only ones in this courtroom who care about people, whose lives were destroyed by the shooting."</P>

<P>Then motioning to prosecutors, she shouted, "these people only care about winning. They don't care about tragedy. They don't care about love. They don't care about family betrayal."</P>

<P>Erik and Lyle Menendez admit shooting  their parents in the living room of the family's Beverly Hills mansion on August 20, 1989. </P>

<P>The brothers claim they were afraid their parents were going to kill them. The defense contends that Jose Menendez threatened to kill his sons to stop Lyle from exposing him as a child molester. On the night of the killings, the father made overtures that he would sexually assault Erik, the defense claims.</P>

<P>In attacking the state's case, Abramson said prosecutors had not proved that the brothers killed out of  hatred or greed .</P>

<P>She criticized Conn for introducing into evidence the taped therapy session in which the brothers confessed the shootings to their therapist, Jerome Oziel, because he was never called to testify during the retrial. </P>

<P>Conn had told jurors that the recording was the smoking gun in the trial. On the tape, the brothers discussed the killings in detail but did not say anything about killing their parents  out of  fear after a lifetime of abuse. </P>

<P>While Conn called the recording the smoking gun in the trial, Abramson derided it as a "cap pistol." </P>

<P>Abramson also attacked the state's theory that the brothers fired shots at their parents' knees to make the killings look like a Mafia hit. She said the bloody crime scene photographs showed highly emotional overkill, not a professional job. </P>

<P>When the Mafia kills someone, they do it with a 22 caliber (weapon), neat, clean and quiet," she said. </P>

<P>FEBRUARY 27<BR>
Defense attorney Leslie Abramson urged the jury to acquit Erik Menendez in the slaying of his mother and find him guilty only of manslaughter in the death of his father.</P>

<P>She told jurors that Erik was in a state of terror on the night of the shootings and that terror made it impossible to form the mental state for murder.</P>

<P>Abramson then explained for jurors how they could find acquit someone who admitted that he killed his parents.</P>

<P>"If, because of my client's mental disorder, he was in such a state of mind that he was not harboring malice . . . then you can't find him guilty of murder. Under that analysis, you can't find him guilty of any crime at all," she said. A finding of malice is a necessary component of murder.</P>

<P>The defense lawyer claims that at the time of the killings, Erik suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as the result of   years of sexual abuse by his father, and physical and psychological abuse by both parents.</P>

<P>Abramson argued that Erik was afraid of his mother because she was an accomplice to her husband's abuse. When he found out several days before the killings that she knew all along about the abuse, it scared him because he realized she had never done anything to protect him and wouldn't do anything in the future.</P>

<P>Abramson also attacked the prosecution's claim the brothers killed for their parents' $14 million fortune.</P>

<P>"Parricide doesn't happen for money," she said. "Don't tell me molestation is made up when something this horrendous happens in this family."</P>

<P>Besides, she said, the brothers had all the money they needed when their parents were alive. Abramson pointed out that the prosecution did not produce any evidence to show the brothers ever wanted more money.</P>

<P>FEBRUARY 28<BR>
Defense attorney Leslie Abramson issued an emotional plea in her closing argument for Erik Menendez, saying it would be the "ultimate tragedy" in her life if she lost the case because it  would be so unjust.</P>

<P>Abramson told jurors that she was proud of her client, who was a "very sick" 19-year-old when she met him and who she saw grew up during the six years Erik has been in jail. Several members of the audience wept as she discussed Erik's life.</P>

<P>She said that the prosecutor's final argument, calling for conviction, was "cold and callous and had nothing to do with my client...What frightens me when I hear an argument like Mr. (David) Conn' s is that it appeals to heartlessness."</P>

<P>Erik and Lyle are charged with murder in the August 20, 1989, shotgun slayings of their parents at the family's Beverly Hills home. The brothers admit they killed, but claim they did so out of fear and to end years of physical, sexual and mental abuse by their parents.</P>

<P>Abramson ended her closing argument by urging jurors not to compromise. She told them not to render a verdict of second-degree murder if  they can't decide between first-degree murder and manslaughter or murder and acquittal. A hung jury would be better than an unjust verdict, she said.</P>

<P>The brothers' first trial ended when two separate juries deadlocked. Only one panel is hearing the second trial.</P>

<P>Lyle's attorney, Charles Gessler, launched a more low-key presentation, attacking prosecution claims that the brothers killed in order to get their hands on the family fortune.</P>

<P>Gessler said testimony showed both brothers believed they were disinherited and would lose their means of support if their parents died.</P>

<P>"Lyle Menendez had everything to gain from his parents being alive. He had a condo, credit cards, tuition at Princeton, clothes. And the only way he could lose all that was to kill his parents, because in his mind he was out of the will," Gessler said. "Does that make sense?"</P>

<P>Gessler was to continue his closing argument Thursday.</P>

<P>FEBRUARY 29<BR>
Closing arguments ended with prosecutor David Conn telling jurors that the defense was a big hoax.</P>

<P>In his rebuttal argument, Conn said Lyle and Erik Menendez blamed the victims, put their parents on trial, crafted a clever abuse excuse and told a lot of lies in order to justify the shootings.</P>

<P>"It's infuriating to sit here and hear counsel telling you Jose Menendez was a sick man because he physically and sexually abused his sons, knowing in this whole trial we didn't hear any evidence of physical and sexual abuse...except through Erik," he said. "I told you they were going to do this -- to put the parents on trial, to get you to hate the parents. So, are you convinced? Do you hate them?"</P>

<P>Conn  proceeded to hold up the most gruesome photograph of Kitty Menendez and told the jury: "How can they shoot their mother like this? What is their defense...You can never pin down what the defense is in this case because no matter what it is, it doesn't make you do this. It doesn't make you kill you mother like this."</P>

<P>Erik and Lyle are charged with murder in the August 20, 1989, shotgun slayings of their parents at the family's Beverly Hills home. The brothers admit they killed, but claim they did so out of fear and to end years of physical, sexual and mental abuse by their parents.</P>

<P>The prosecution claims the brothers murdered their parents in a greedy bid to get their hands on the family's $14 million fortune.</P>

<P>Lyle's attorney Charles Gessler concluded his closing argument by asking jurors to find his client not guilty of murdering his mother  and guilty only of manslaughter in the death of his father.</P>

<P>Gessler compared the case to a Greek tragedy with Jose and Kitty Menendez bringing about their own demise because of fatal moral flaws.</P>

<P>He said Jose caused his own death by molesting his sons and making them believe that they could never escape him. As a result, the brothers felt their only option was to arm themselves. He also argued that Kitty brought about her death by not protecting her sons and by making them believe she was an enforcer of her husband's abuse.</P>

<P>MARCH 1<BR>
The jury deliberated for about three hours after receiving instructions from Judge Stanley Weisberg.</P>

<P>The jury must reach verdicts on three counts for each brother:  two counts of murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder. Also, there are two special circumstances -- lying in wait and multiple murder.</P>

<P>If the jury finds the brothers guilty of first-degree murder, it will have to decide the special circumstances of lying in wait -- whether the murders were committed after a period of waiting and watching for an advantageous moment to take the victims by surprise. In other words, an ambush. </P>

<P>If the jury convicts either brother of first-degree murder on one count and at least second-degree murder on another count, then multiple murder automatically applies.</P>

<P>If one or both special circumstances are found for either or both brothers, the jury will have to return for a penalty phase to determine whether to recommend a sentence of life in prison without parole, or death. Defense attorneys estimate a penalty phase would take two to three months, during which they would call about 40 witnesses.</P>

<h2>Trial Summary: Week 19</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from Feb. 19 - 23.</P>

<P>FEBRUARY 19<BR>
The court was in recess.</P>

<P>FEBRUARY 20<BR>
Closing arguments began with prosecutor David Conn ridiculing the brothers' claims of abuse as  "the silliest most ridiculous story ever told in a courtroom."</P>

<P>Conn attacked Lyle and Erik Menendez and their defense in an argument that often was belittling and sarcastic. </P>

<P>Conn told jurors about two types of defenses: the "I-didn't-do-it defense" and the "okay-I-did-it-but-not-the-way-the-state-says-I did it" defense. The brothers, he said, had to choice but to select the second defense.</P>

<P>"We caught the defendants essentially red-handed," he said. "We have the defendants guilty of killing their parents. There is no way to get around that."</P>

<P>The brothers admit shooting Jose and Kitty Menendez in the living room of the family's Beverly Hills mansion on August 20, 1989. </P>

<P>The brothers claim they were afraid their parents were going to kill them. The defense contends that Jose Menendez threatened to kill his sons to stop Lyle from exposing him as a child molester. On the night of the killings, the father made overtures that he would sexually assault Erik, the defense claims.</P>

<P>But Judge Stanley Weisberg ruled the defense could not argue that Erik and Lyle killed their parents because they mistakenly believed their parents would kill them first.</P>

<P>The judge said there was not sufficient evidence that the brothers were in imminent danger on the night of the shootings.  In ruling on legal instructions to be read to jurors after closing arguments, Judge Weisberg essentially threw out the theory of "imperfect self-defense." </P>

<P>The theory was the heart of the defense in the first trial and convinced at least half the jurors on each of the two panels to vote to convict the brothers of manslaughter instead of murder. </P>

<P>Judge Weisberg said he would allow the defense to argue that the brothers shot their father in the heat of passion, but not their mother.  While there was sufficient evidence to show that Jose Menendez might have provoked his sons into committing a homicide, there was insufficient evidence to show that Kitty did so, the judge said.</P>

<P>Conn urged the jurors to find the brothers guilty of murder and not manslaughter.</P>

<P>"Heat of passion does not apply even if you go down the road hand-in-hand with Erik Menendez," he said, suggesting that even if jurors believe Erik's claims of physical, psychological and sexual abuse, it does not constitute heat of passion. </P>

<P>The state contends the brothers killed their parents in order to get their hands on the family fortune.</P>

<P>FEBRUARY 21<BR>
The tensions in the Menendez home were caused by the realization that Lyle and Erik Menendez would never live up to their father's expectations and not because they were molested, a prosecutor charged during the second day of closing arguments.</P>

<P>Prosecutor David Conn described Jose Menendez as a Cuban immigrant who had lived the American dream by becoming a successful entertainment executive. All he wanted from his sons, Conn told jurors, was for them to achieve what he had achieved and more.</P>

<P>But by 1989, the family realized that would never happen. Conn seemed to almost taunt the brothers as he turned towards them and said: "Lyle Menendez did not have the drive. He did not have the intellect. He did not have the motivation. and Erik Menendez was an even greater failure. he was weak. Erik Menendez was soft...He was described as a crybaby."</P>

<P>The brothers stared wide-eyed at Conn as he described their father as a man who loved his sons too much.</P>

<P>Attorneys for the brothers asked the judge for a mistrial and denounced Conn's final argument as "a fairy story" that falsely cast an incestuous, abusive father as a loving parent. In a hearing outside the presence of the jury, Leslie Abramson, Erik's lawyer, said Conn's depiction was unfair because defense lawyers were barred  from  putting  on most  witnesses  whose testimony would have been critical of the parents. Judge Stanley Weisberg denied the request.</P>

<P>Lyle, 28, and Erik, 25, are charged with shot gunning their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills mansion on August  20, 1989. The brothers' first trial ended when two separate juries deadlocked. Only one panel is hearing the second trial. </P>

<P>Conn asked jurors to convict both brothers of premeditated first-degree murder, conspiracy and the special circumstance of lying in wait, which could bring them the death penalty. The prosecution argues the young men killed to acquire the family fortune. </P>

<P>Conn also argued that a tape recording of a therapy session the brothers had with Dr. Jerome Oziel was the smoking gun in the trial. On the tape, the brothers discussed the killings in detail but did not say anything about killing their parents  out of  fear after a lifetime of abuse. Dr. Oziel, the brothers' former psychologist, did not testify during the trial.</P>

<P>The prosecutor also denounced the Menendez brothers as spoiled children. "What you see are two young men who felt they were entitled, they were spoiled. They seized the power," Conn said. </P>

<P>The brothers claim they were afraid their parents were going to kill them. The defense contends that Jose Menendez threatened to kill his sons to stop Lyle from exposing him as a child molester. On the night of the killings, the father made overtures that he would sexually assault Erik, the defense claims.</P>

<P>FEBRUARY 22<BR>
Prosecutor David Conn attacked the testimony of  Erik Menendez as a self-serving script, full of inconsistencies and lies.</P>

<P>Conn ridiculed Erik's claim that he and his brother shot their parents out of fear for their lives, telling jurors that the brothers' actions in the week leading up to the August 20, 1989, slayings were inconsistent with two people who were afraid of being killed.</P>

<P>Conn insisted that the portrait of the brothers as abused sons terrorized by a tyrannical father was untrue. He said the defendants could have left their parents' home and sought refuge elsewhere if they truly feared being killed.</P>

<P>"He (Erik) wants you to believe his father is abusing him on a routine basis, forcing him to engage in sexual acts against his will," Conn said. "He expects you to believe it never occurred to him to leave...Erik Menendez would have thought about it. Erik Menendez would have considered it. To say it never occurred to him is absurd."</P>

<P>Meanwhile, the California Supreme Court refused to overturn Judge Stanley Weisberg's ruling that the defense could not argue that Erik and Lyle killed their parents because they mistakenly believed their parents would kill them first. </P>

<P>The judge said there was not sufficient evidence that the brothers were in imminent danger on the night of the shootings.  In ruling on legal instructions to be read to jurors after closing arguments, Judge Weisberg essentially threw out the theory of "imperfect self-defense." </P>

<P>FEBRUARY 23<BR>
Erik and Lyle Menendez knew they were going to kill their parents when they rushed into their living room with loaded shotguns on August 20, 1989, a prosecutor told jurors during the fourth day of closing arguments.</P>

<P>In urging jurors to return a verdict of first-degree murder, prosecutor David Conn said the defense had not done anything to refute the evidence that the fatal shootings of Jose and Kitty Menendez were premeditated and deliberate.</P>

<P>He dismissed a psychologist's finding that Erik Menendez was  molested  by  his father and suffered from "battered person syndrome" at the time of the shootings.</P>

<P>"The  fact is, the battered person syndrome does not exist," Conn said. "It is not a proper diagnosis...It is not a mental disorder."</P>

<P>Erik,  25,  and  Lyle,  28,  contend  that  they killed their parents out of fear following a lifetime of physical, sexual and mental abuse. The  brothers'  first trial ended when two separate juries deadlocked. Only one panel is hearing the second trial.</P>

<P>Conn,  in an unusually prolonged final summation, also returned to a theme he addressed  at the outset, urging jurors to reject Erik's claims that he was sexually abused by their father throughout his life.</P>

<P>"Did  Jose  Menendez  ever  put a hand on Erik Menendez? Did he ever sexually touch him in any way? I submit he did not," Conn said.</P>

<h2>Trial Summary: Week 18</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from Feb.12 -16.</P>

<P>FEBRUARY 12<BR>
The court was in recess.</P>

<P>FEBRUARY 13<BR>
The defense called several rebuttal witnesses to dispute numerous elements of the circumstances surrounding the fatal shootings of Jose and Kitty Menendez.</P>

<P>Marta Cano said she obtained a Florida drivers' license for Erik Menendez because his California license was suspended. The testimony was aimed at trying to prove that Erik used a friend's identification to purchase shotguns because he didn't have his own California identification.</P>

<P>The prosecution believes Erik's used a friend's identification because he purchased the guns to kill his parents and wanted to escape detection. But Erik testified that he purchased the weapons for protection from his parents and didn't care about being found out.</P>

<P>Another witness, Teresita Baralt, testified about furniture in the living room den of the Menendez home.  She said that new furniture was put in the room several days after the August 20, 1989, shootings. The testimony was aimed at refuting testimony from Erik's friend Craig Cignarelli, who claimed Erik provided him with details of the shooting. Cignarelli said there was no furniture in the room when Erik gave him a tour of the room several weeks after the shooting.</P>

<P>FEBRUARY 14<BR>
The defense continued its attack on the credibility of Craig Cignarelli, who testified that Erik Menendez told him all about the killings.</P>

<P>Linda Ellman, the former executive producer of  "Hard Copy," told jurors that the tabloid television show  paid $25,000 to Cignarelli  for his exclusive story about Erik. The defense contends that Cignarelli made up the gruesome details of Erik's alleged confession in order to get a better deal from the television program. </P>

<P>Cignarelli had offered an account of the August 20, 1989, killings that differed dramatically from that given by Erik on the witness stand at his retrial. Cignarelli testified that Erik told him the shootings occurred moments after he returned home to pick up a fake identification card, and saw Lyle standing outside with two shotguns.</P>

<P>According to Cignarelli's account, Lyle said to Erik, "Let's do it," and the brothers went into the den, where their parents were. Cignarelli said Erik told him that Lyle started shooting and then turned to his younger brother and said, "shoot mom," who was standing, screaming.</P>

<P>During her testimony, Ellman was questioned about how Cignarelli spent the money he received for his television appearance. She said he gave $3,000 to a charity for abused children. Cignarelli had testified that he gave $5,000.</P>

<P>The defense, trying to show that Cignarelli lied on the witness stand, then called another witness to confirm the $3,000 donation. But when they tried to call another witness to say the same thing, Judge Stanley Weisberg cut them off, saying, "this is not the trial of Mr. Cignarelli, no matter how much you want to make it so."</P>

<P>FEBRUARY 15<BR>
Judge Stanley Weisberg's decision to limit the testimony of a defense psychiatrist prompted an angry response from a defense attorney who said the brothers were not getting a fair trial.</P>

<P>The judge ruled that Dr. William Vicary could not offer his opinions about Erik Menendez's state of mind at the time of the shootings or any other time in his life. The testimony, the judge ruled, would be repetitive to earlier testimony offered by defense witness Dr. John Wilson. </P>

<P>During his testimony, Dr. Wilson said Erik suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder caused by years of physical, sexual and emotional abuse at the hands of the parents.</P>

<P>The decision infuriated attorney Leslie Abramson, who accused the judge of being unfair and wrong. </P>

<P>Dr. Vicary also was not allowed to give the testimony that he gave in the first trial, when he said that he believed Erik's claims of molestation and that he killed his parents out of fear. Instead, he was allowed to testify only about anxiety disorders in general.The result was a far less powerful witness than the one who supported the defense's theory of the shootings during the first trial.</P>

<P>Dr. Vicary,  who has been treating Erik since shortly after his arrest in 1990, has diagnosed  Erik as suffering  from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.</P>

<P>FEBRUARY 16<BR>
The defense suffered a major setback when Judge Stanley Weisberg stripped it of its principal theory -- that Erik and Lyle Menendez killed their parents because they mistakenly believed their parents would kill them first.</P>

<P>The judge said there was not sufficient evidence that the brothers were in imminent danger when they fatally shot their parents on August 20, 1989. In ruling on legal instructions to be read to jurors after closing arguments, Judge Weisberg essentially threw out the theory of "imperfect self-defense." </P>

<P>The theory was the heart of the defense in the first trial and convinced at least half the jurors on each of the two panels to vote to convict the brothers of manslaughter instead of murder. </P>

<P>By refusing to instruct the jury on imperfect self-defense, the judge eliminated one theory on which the defense can argue for manslaughter instead of murder. Judge Weisberg said he would allow the defense to argue that the brothers shot their father in the heat of passion, but not their mother.  While there was sufficient evidence to show that Jose Menendez might have provoked his sons into committing a homicide, there was insufficient evidence to show that Kitty did so, the judge said.</P>

<P>Defense attorney Leslie Abramson said she was shocked by the ruling because "there is no bigger provocation than a mother telling her son she knew he had been molested by his father for 12 years and she didn't care."</P>

<P>The brothers have pleaded not guilty in the shotgun slayings of Jose, 45, a wealthy entertainment executive, and Kitty, 47, in the den of the family's Beverly Hills mansion.</P>

<P>While manslaughter convictions carry a maximum penalty of 11 years, a conviction on the lesser murder count carries a 15-years-to-life prison term. If convicted of first-degree murder in both deaths, the brothers could face the death penalty.</P>

<P>Abramson said she will seek acquittal based on diminished mental state. She said Erik suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of a lifetime of physical, sexual and psychological abuse, and was in a hyper-aroused state at the time of the killings.</P>

<P>The "imperfect self-defense theory" that Judge Weisberg rejected holds that a person who "kills another person in the honest but unreasonable belief in the necessity to defend against imminent peril to life or great bodily injury...is not guilty of murder."</P>

<P>The defense contends that Jose Menendez threatened to kill his sons to stop Lyle from exposing him as a child molester. On the night of the killings, the father made overtures that he would sexually assault Erik, the defense claims.</P>

<P>Prosecutor David Conn contends that the parents did nothing more than go into the den and shut the door, and that if the brothers really thought their parents were going to kill them, they could have driven away.</P>

<P>The state believes the brothers killed their parents in order to get their hands on the family fortune. </P>

<h2>Trial Summary: Week 17</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from Feb. 5 - 9.</P>

<P>FEBRUARY 5<BR>
Lyle Menendez's former fiancee contradicted Erik's earlier testimony about when he learned that his brother wore a wig.</P>
 
<P>Jamie Pisarcik testified that Erik told her in late 1988 he was "surprised about Lyle's wig." On cross-examination, defense lawyers tried to show that Pisarcik either made up the story or simply thought she had the conversation with Erik before the killings.</P>

<P>Pisarcik's testimony could call into question a major part of the defense case: that a week-long family confrontation between Jose and Kitty Menendez and their sons led to the fatal shootings on August 20, 1989.</P>

<P>Erik had testified that he found out about the hairpiece just days before the killings, when Kitty Menendez ripped it off Lyle's head and threw it in his face.  Erik said he thought that his mother had ripped Lyle's hair right out of his head. </P>

<P>Erik said the revelation made him realize that the family was fraught with secrets and he then decided to tell Lyle his secret -- that he had been molested by their father. According to Erik, an enraged Lyle threatened to expose his father as a child molester if he didn't stop. The father responded by threatening to kill his sons, Erik said. The brothers claim they shot their parents out of fear for their lives. </P>

<P>FEBRUARY 6<BR>
Lyle Menendez's former fiancee Jamie Pisarcik completed her testimony.</P>

<P>FEBRUARY 7<BR>
The court was in recess because Erik Menendez was sick.</P>

<P>FEBRUARY 8<BR>
A prominent psychiatrist testified that Erik Menendez did not suffer from any disorder that would have impaired his ability to make rational decisions on the night he shot his parents.</P>

<P>Dr. Park Dietz instead diagnosed Erik as suffering from generalized anxiety disorder -- the inability to control his restlessness, worry and irritability. In other words, Erik was just a worried person when he shot his parents on August 20, 1989.</P>

<P>The defense claims that Erik suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder caused by years of psychological, physical and sexual abuse at the hands of his parents. Dr. Dietz told jurors that it was impossible to diagnose Erik with the disorder because there's no way of knowing if the events that allegedly caused it were true. </P>

<P>"I don't believe he has Post Traumatic Stress Disorder," said Dr. Dietz, who interviewed Erik for 16 hours several weeks ago. "Instead, I'm diagnosing generalized anxiety disorder."</P>

<P>Dr. John Wilson, a defense psychiatric expert, previously testified that Erik was suffering from the disorder when he and his brother killed his parents. Dr. Wilson said that Erik did not appear to be faking the claims of abuse.</P>

<P>The state's decision to call Dr. Dietz is one of the most significant differences in this trial compared to the first trial. Prosecutors in the first trial made a motion early in the trial to have one of its experts examine the brothers. But they never followed through with the motion, and dropped the issue. </P>

<P>Over the years, Dr. Dietz has testified in numerous high-profile trials. His critics say his testimony always favors the prosecution. He has helped prosecutors win convictions against Betty Broderick for fatally shooting her husband and his second wife, and serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer.</P>

<P>During his testimony, Dr. Dietz also rejected other conclusions presented by the defense's expert witness.</P>

<P>The defense claims Erik could not just leave his abusive environment because he suffered from learned helplessness, a symptom of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. But Dr. Dietz said the fact that Erik left to buy shotguns, loaded the weapon and went to a shooting range to learn to fire the weapon showed rebelliousness and assertive behavior, inconsistent with the passiveness of learned helplessness.</P>

<P>FEBRUARY 9<BR>
The prosecution completed its rebuttal case after defense attorneys concluded a surprisingly short cross-examination of psychiatrist Dr. Park Dietz.</P>

<P>Defense attorney Leslie Abramson said she questioned Dr. Dietz only for two hours because she believed his testimony did more good than harm for the defense. </P>

<P>Dr. Dietz testified that Erik Menendez suffered from an anxiety disorder, but was rational at the time he shot his parents. </P>

<P>But Dr. Dietz also said it's impossible to diagnose Erik with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder because there's no way of knowing if the events that allegedly caused the disorder were true. The defense claims that Erik suffers from the disorder because of  years of psychological, physical and sexual abuse at the hands of his parents. </P>

<h2>Trial Summary: Week 16</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from Jan. 29 - Feb. 2.</P>

<P>JANUARY 29<BR>
The defense presented testimony to try and refute prosecution claims that Lyle and Erik Menendez killed their parents in order to get the family fortune. </P>

<P>Marta Cano, Jose Menendez's older sister,testified that shortly after the August 1989 killings, the brothers told her that they believed they had been written out of their father's will a year earlier. </P>

<P>The jury also heard from Mary Dominquez, who helped the Menendez family move into their Beverly Hills mansion in 1987. She said she saw male pornographic magazines and videos in packing boxes in the den and in the master bedroom. The defense has suggested this is evidence of Jose Menendez's sexual preferences. If he's interested in sex between men, the defense argues, then he was interested in sex with his sons. </P>

<P>Meanwhile, Judge Stanley Weisberg ruled the defense can not present testimony from Marta Cano's former husband, Peter, who testified in the first trial that Jose Menendez punched 5-year-old Lyle in the stomach, causing him to wet his pants. The judge ruled the incident was irrelevant. </P>

<P>Cano became the latest witness that Judge Weisberg has cut from the defense witness list in the last two days. He previously eliminated six witnesses from the defense list, ruling that they are irrelevant in the current trial, although they did testify at the first trial. The witnesses include Lyle and Erik's teachers, friends and a coach, and all would have testified about the parents' alleged psychological mistreatment of their sons. </P>

<P>JANUARY 30<BR>
After presenting 25 witnesses and more than 400 exhibits, the defense indicated that was about to rest its case. </P>

<P>And it does not appear that the jury will hear testimony from Lyle Menendez. </P>

<P>Lyle arguably was the defense's strongest witness in the first trial. But attorneys decided not to have him testify in this trial because of the damaging impeachment evidence the prosecution gathered since the first trial. The prosecution now has a letter Lyle wrote his former girlfriend, telling her exactly how to testify in the first trial. </P>

<P>There is also Norma Novelli, Lyle's one-time confidant, who tape-recorded her conversations with him and went to prosecutors with the tapes. Judge Stanley Weisberg has ruled that Novelli can't testify unless Lyle takes the witness stand. </P>

<P>The defense also did not present testimony from numerous teachers, coaches and friends of the brothers, who testified in the first trial about life in the Menendez home. In response to prosecution objections, Judge Weisberg ruled that most of the witnesses were irrelevant or that their testimony was redundant. </P>

<P>The judge also severely limited the testimony of mental health experts -- he allowed one compared to the five who testified in the first trial. </P>

<P>So Erik Menendez became the defense star witness in this case. The defense's other main witness was   Dr. John Wilson, the defense's expert in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. He testified that Erik suffered from the disorder on the night of the killings.</P>

<P>During the first trial, the defense took three months to present 56 witnesses. </P>

<P>The prosecution is scheduled to call seven rebuttal witnesses. They include Dr. Park Dietz, a psychiatrist who examined Erik; Craig Cignarelli, Erik's former best friend, and Jamie Pisarcik, Lyle's former girlfriend. </P>

<P>JANUARY 31<BR>
The defense rested after the trial judge dealt two final blows to its case. </P>

<P>Judge Stanley Weisberg ruled defense attorneys could not introduce the testimony of Dr. William Vicary, a psychiatrist who has been treating Erik Menendez since 1990. The judge ruled the testimony only would be relevant as sur-rebuttal testimony, to rebut the testimony of the state's psychiatrist. </P>

<P>The judge then ruled the defense could not introduce the videotaped testimony of Lyle Menendez's testimony from the first trial. So the defense rested after 39 days of testimony from 25 witnesses. </P>

While Lyle was arguably the defense's strongest witness in the first trial, attorneys decided not to have him testify in this trial because of the damaging impeachment evidence the prosecution gathered since the first trial. The prosecution now has a letter Lyle wrote his former girlfriend, telling her exactly how to testify in the first trial. There is also Norma Novelli,  Lyle's one-time confidant, who tape-recorded her conversations with him and went to prosecutors with the tapes. 

The brothers have admitted killing their parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez, on August  20, 1989 at the family home in Beverly Hills. 

The defense argues that the two shot their parents out of fear after years of sexual, physical and psychological abuse. The prosecution contends they murdered their parents out of greed for the millions controlled by their Cuban-born entertainment industry executive father.

<h2>Trial Summary: Week 15</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from January 22-26.</P>

<P>JANUARY 22<BR>
A defense witness testified about the diagnostic tests Erik Menendez took to determine his level of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.</P>

<P>Dr. John Wilson said Erik scored higher that most PTSD victims in the categories of intense anxiety, dissociation and impaired self-esteem. Erik scored highest in the area that measures "trauma from an intrusive experience" -- a result, Wilson said, of prolonged sexual abuse at the hands of his father. </P>

<P>Dr. Wilson also testified that Erik scored lower than the average PTSD profile in hostility, irritability and anger. He told jurors that Erik tended to be more passive than angry and that he never expressed any anger towards his parents throughout his childhood or during the days before the fatal shootings of Jose and Kitty Menendez. </P>

<P>Dr. Wilson, director of the Center for Stress & Trauma in Cleveland, evaluated Erik's claim after interviewing him for 30 hours. Wilson also testified that Erik scored zero on a "homicidality" test administered in December.  The test showed that Erik, even at the time he killed his parents, did not have homicidal impulses or fantasies, the witness said. </P>

<P>JANUARY 23<BR>
Defense attorneys demanded a mistrial after the prosecution began its cross-examination of a key defense expert witness. </P>

<P>The defense request came after prosecutor David Conn asked Dr. John Wilson whether he knew that one of Erik Menendez's lawyers had written a book about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. </P>

<P>The prosecution believes that Erik does not suffer from the disorder and has fabricated the defense. The defense argued that Conn made an improper inference that defense attorney Barry Levin was selected to help represent Erik because he is a PTSD specialist, and that he provided Erik with literature and perhaps coached him on the disorder. </P>

<P>Dr. Wilson, director of the Center for Stress & Trauma in Cleveland, previously testified that Erik suffers from the disorder as a result of prolonged sexual and physical abuse. </P>

<P>Judge Stanley Weisberg denied the request for a mistrial and instead told jurors to disregard the question about the book. </P>

<P>Outside of court, Levin was confident that an appeals court would throw out any convictions in the case. </P>

<P>The defense insists that California law says you can't use a defendant's choice of attorney against him. And, you can't suggest that a defendant chose a particular attorney to gain an unfair advantage. But Conn said that he only responded to the defense's suggestion that Erik did not have access to literature about PTSD and therefore could not have made up the defense. </P>

<P>Erik and his brother Lyle have admitted killing their parents on August 20, 1989. The brothers claim they feared for their lives after years of sexual, physical and emotional abuse. Prosecutors contend they killed to get the family fortune. </P>

<P>Erik testified earlier in the retrial that his father sexually molested him for 12 years. Lyle also claims he was sexually abused by his parents, but has not yet testified at the retrial. The brothers claim they thought their parents were going to kill them because Lyle had threatened to expose his father as a child molester.</P>

<P>JANUARY 24<BR>
Prosecutor David Conn questioned a key defense witness about the results of psychological diagnostic tests given to Erik Menendez.</P>


<P>When Conn pointed out that it would be easy to lie in answering the test questions, Dr. John Wilson responded that he had to rely on Erik's word as the basis of most of the test results. Conn's inference was that the test results are not valid if Erik was lying. </P>

<P>For example, Dr. Wilson testified that Erik scored zero on a "homicidality" test administered in December.  The test showed that Erik, even at the time he killed his parents, did not have homicidal impulses or fantasies. But, Conn referring to the doctor's notes of his interviews with Erik, pointed out that Erik previously told Dr. Wilson that he had a fantasy about killing his father by smashing his head with a tennis racket. </P>

<P>So Conn asked the witness why he never confronted Erik with this revelation when Erik scored zero on the "homicidality" test.  Dr. Wilson said he did not consider the tennis racket fantasy a serious thought of killing someone. </P>

<P>Wilson conceded that Post Traumatic Stress Disorder does not cause a person to become homicidal, and that the majority of PTSD patients who commit homicide are Vietnam War veterans. </P>

<P>JANUARY 25<BR>
A key expert defense witness completed his testimony after seven days on the witness stand. </P>

<P>Dr. Wilson, director of the Center for Stress & Trauma in Cleveland, testified that Erik suffers from the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of prolonged sexual and physical abuse. He also said Erik was suffering from the disorder when he and his brother Lyle shot their parents on August 20, 1989. </P>

<P>The prosecution tried to discredit Dr. Wilson by questioning the validity of the tests used to diagnose Erik's illness. </P>

<P>JANUARY 26<BR>
In response to objections from the prosecution, Judge Stanley Weisberg cut six witnesses from the defense list, ruling that they are irrelevant in the current trial, although they did testify at the first trial. The witnesses include Lyle and Erik's teachers, friends and a coach, and all would have testified about the parents' alleged psychological mistreatment of the brothers. The judge ruled that the issue of psychological mistreatment is irrelevant in the current trial.</P>

<P>Judge Weisberg had already ruled during pretrial hearings that several similar witnesses -- coaches, teachers and friends -- would not be allowed to testify. According to the defense, the judge has eliminated 25 people from its original witness list.</P>

<P>Four witnesses did testify on Friday:</P>

<P>Andy Cano, Erik's cousin, testified that when Erik was about 12 years old, he told Andy that his father was "massaging his dick." Cano also said that Erik always had bruises on his upper thighs -- a result of Jose's constant beatings, according to the defense.</P>

<P>Norman Puls, Erik's math tutor from 1987-89, testified that Erik had had periods when he "zoned out" -- one noted symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder.</P>

<P>Noel Nedley, Erik's roommate after the killings, said that he'd heard tape recordings Kitty Menendez had made of Erik's phone conversations. Erik testified that one of the reasons he was so afraid of his mother is that she knew things about him that he thought she had no way to know. As it turned out, after the killings Erik discovered that his mother had been tapping his phone.</P>

<P>Marta Cano, Jose Menendez's older sister, testified about a $650,000 life insurance policy she wrote for Jose. Because Kitty died also, Lyle and Erik were the beneficiaries of the policy. </P>

<h2>Trial Summary: Week 14</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from Jan. 15 - 19.</P>

<P>JANUARY 15<BR>
The court was in recess.</P>

<P>JANUARY 16<BR>
A cousin of the Menendez brothers offered the first evidence to corroborate Erik Menendez's claims of sexual and physical abuse. </P>

<P>Brian Alan Andersen said Jose Menendez terrorized his sons by brandishing a belt when he came home from work. He would snap the belt on the coffee table or couch as Kitty Menendez rattled off a list of reasons to discipline the brothers.  Andersen also testified that Jose Menendez  took showers with Erik and Lyle when they were teenagers.</P> 

<P>During cross-examination, prosecutor David Conn tried to establish that Andersen was biased in favor of the brothers. He pointed out that Andersen refused to speak with prosecutors. </P>

<P>Andersen also admitted that Lyle Menendez gave him $8,500 just weeks before the brothers were arrested in March 1990. Andersen needed the money to pay a hospital bill. Conn suggested that if Andersen testified for Lyle, then Lyle would not make him pay back the money. But Andersen said he told Lyle that he could not repay the money because his daughter is dying and he was having trouble paying those medical bills. </P>

<P>Andersen said his father refused to offer financial assistance because he is estranged from the family. Brian Andersen Sr. was the only family member to testify for the prosecution in the case. </P>

<P>JANUARY 17<BR>
A cousin of the Menendez brothers testified that Jose Menendez spent hours with Erik behind the closed door of his bedroom -- a claim the defense says is evidence of sexual molestation. </P>

<P>The witness, Diane Vander Molen, testified that Jose Menendez terrified his son by "roaring at him," and that he was "fierce in his anger." Vander Molen broke down in tears as she told jurors how Kitty Menendez would scream at Erik for making mistakes on his homework. </P>

<P>"Erik was just a kid," she testified. "He was just trying to get it right." </P>

<P>Vander Molen lived at the Menendez home for months  at a time in the 1970s and early 1980s. In the first trial, she offered evidence of possible sexual molestation when she said that when Lyle was eight years old, he hold her that his father had been touching his genitals. </P>

<P>Judge Stanley Weisberg barred Vander Molen from testifying about the incident, ruling it irrelevant since Lyle has not yet testified. </P>

<P>During a dramatic cross-examination, prosecutor David Conn challenged Vander Molen's accounts of Kitty Menendez's temper tantrums. But through his questioning, he allowed the witness to describe in detail the frightening, unpredictable violent rages that Kitty Menendez would fly into. </P>

<P>JANUARY 18<BR>
The defense offered additional testimony about possible abuse in the Menendez home. </P>

<P>The witnesses included Kathy Simonton, a cousin of the brothers, who testified how Jose Menendez  treated his sons when he taught them how to swim. She said he dunked their heads under water until they kicked, flailed, choked and cried. </P>

<P>Additional testimony came from Dr. Kerry English who reviewed Erik's childhood medical records. He said Erik suffered an injury to the back of his throat that could be consistent with forced oral sex. </P>

<P>JANUARY 19<BR>
The defense presented expert testimony to explain why Erik Menendez never tried to escape the alleged abuse at the hands of his father.</P>

<P>Dr. John Wilson testified about what he called the common misconceptions about victims of child abuse.  Two of the misconceptions, he said, are that abuse victims can just pack up and leave their abusers and that abuse victims reveal their situations. </P>

<P>Dr. Wilson explained that more than 90 percent of children who are abused never run away from home. Abuse victims, he said, suffer from "a learned helplessness," characterized by a dependency on the abuser that is nearly impossible to break. </P>

<P>Erik became especially dependent because his parents controlled every aspect of his life, Dr. Wilson said. Erik did not believe he could leave home or that he had anywhere else to go. Dr. Wilson said Erik did not know any other way of life than the one he had at home -- regardless of how abusive the environment. </P>

<P>The prosecution repeatedly asked Erik why he did not leave home to escape the alleged abuse by his father. Prosecutors also wanted to know why he never told friends or relatives about the abuse. </P>

<P>Dr. Wilson told jurors that abuse victims almost never divulge that they are being abused. Wilson said incest victims usually take months or years of therapy before they reveal such secrets. </P>

<P>Dr. Wilson began testifying last week but his testimony was interrupted because of a scheduling conflict. He previously testified that Erik has been suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder since he was a child, and that he was suffering from it on the night of the shootings.</P>

<h2>Trial Summary: Week 13</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from Jan. 8 - 12.</P>

<P>JANUARY 8<BR>
The prosecution concluded its eight day cross-examination of Erik Menendez by once again focusing on the brothers' spending habits after the deaths of their parents.</P>

<P>Deputy District Attorney David Conn questioned Erik about why the brothers never purchased a headstone for their parents' graves. </P>

<P>"Mr. Menendez, when you were spending money following the death of your parents, the killing of your parents, did you purchase them a headstone?"  he asked. </P>
   
<P>"I was not involved in that process," Erik answered. </P>

<P>Jose and Kitty Menendez's graves in New Jersey were without headstones until after the brothers were arrested in March 1990 for the August 1989 slayings of Jose and Kitty Menendez. </P>

<P>The prosecution previously presented testimony about how the brothers spent thousands of dollars on jewelry, clothing, cars, resort holidays and gambling after the slayings. </P>

<P>Conn also spent the eighth and final day of cross-examination by questioning Erik about the tape-recorded therapy session he had with Dr. Jerome Oziel on December 11, 1989. Conn asked Erik why, if he trusted Oziel enough to tell him about the shootings, he never told him about the lifetime of abuse. </P>

<P>Erik responded that Oziel was blackmailing the brothers and that he did not trust him. According to Erik, Oziel said he wouldn't go to the police with the information that the brothers killed their parents if they agreed to make the tape, say what Oziel wanted them to say, continue going to therapy for the rest of their lives and invest their inheritance in his business. </P>

<P>The prosecution still does not intend to call Oziel as a witness. Conn has said that he does not need his testimony because Erik's testimony is so absurd that the jury will not believe it. The defense contends that the prosecution does not want to call Oziel because he can not deny that he was blackmailing the brothers. </P>

<P>JANUARY 9<BR>
After 15 days of testimony, Erik Menendez finally stepped down from the witness stand. </P>

<P>He spent most of the day under redirect examination by his attorney, Barry Levin, explaining issued raised by the state during eight days of cross-examination. </P>

<P>Among other issues, Erik said there were no eyewitnesses to the sexual abuse because his father would never think of molesting him in public. He also explained that he thought he was going to be removed from his parents' will in 1988 and if he was going to kill them for the money, he would have done it at that time. </P>

<P>Erik also said he and his brother did not concoct stories of sexual abuse in order to avoid murder convictions. To try and bolster the claim, Levin tried to introduce a letter found in Erik's jail cell several months after his arrest. In the letter, Lyle wrote that he did not want to reveal the family secret of sexual abuse as a defense for the slayings. </P>

<P>The defense claimed the letter proves the brothers did not make up the story of sexual abuse to avoid the murder convictions. But Judge Stanley Weisberg ruled the letter was hearsay evidence and not admissible. </P>

<P>By the end of the day, Erik had been through a final series of questions from his lawyer and prosecution.
Prosecutor and defense attorneys took turns asking, respectively, "did you intend to kill your parents?" and "did you kill in as blind panic." </P>

<P>Erik insisted that at the time of the August 1989 slayings, he was shooting in a blind panic and did not think about what he was doing. But, he admitted, that when he looks back at it now, he realizes that it looks as though by getting the gun and pulling the trigger, he must have intended to kill his parents. </P>

<P>JANUARY 10<BR>
The court was in recess. </P>

<P>JANUARY 11<BR>
The defense case entered a new phase as a psychologist testified that Erik Menendez suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder at the time he killed his parents. </P>

<P>Dr. John P. Wilson told jurors that the cause of Erik's disorder was the repeated acts of sexual molestation and physical and psychological abuse. He said Erik exhibited classic disorder symptoms such as recurring nightmares and amnesia. </P>

<P>"Sexual abuse of children first and foremost violates the most basic bond between the child and parents . . the bond of trust," he said. </P>

<P>Wilson said that post-traumatic stress disorder sufferers who have been terrorized typically fear imminent death. The brothers claim they were in a heightened state of fear at the time of the shootings and thought their parents were going to kill them. The prosecution claims the brothers killed Jose and Kitty Menendez out of  hatred and greed. </P>

<P>JANUARY 12<BR>
The lawyer defending Lyle Menendez indicated a significant change in legal strategy. </P>

<P>Attorney Charles Gessler told the court that he plans to argue Lyle killed in the heat of passion -- that fear and anger overwhelmed him on August 20, 1989, when he and his brother shot their parents. </P>

<P>During the first trial, Lyle said he killed out of the honest but mistaken belief that his parents were going to kill him. He said he was afraid for his life. </P>

<P>His lawyer now says Lyle was a reasonable man who reacted out of  anger, fear and passion. </P>

<P>According to the defense, the brothers had a fight with their parents on August 20. The incident followed a week of tensions after Lyle threatened his father to stop molesting Erik or he would go to the police. During the week, Erik convinced Lyle that their father was capable of killing them and the brothers went and purchased shotguns for protection. </P>

<P>Finally, on the night of the final confrontation, Jose told Erik to go to his room. The brothers took this to mean that he was about to molest Erik. </P>

<P>"You're not putting your hands on my brothers again," Lyle shouted at his father. "He's my son. I'll do what I want," Jose Menendez responded. </P>

<P>Lyle believed his  brother was about to be raped. He went  into an emotional state of fear and anger. His passion overwhelmed all sense of reason. He got his gun and shot his parents. </P>

<P>There is a key distinction between this defense and the one offered during the first trial. </P>

<P>At the first trial, the lawyers used the so-called imperfect self-defense theory. Under this theory, the brothers could not be judged by the standard of what a reasonable person would do.  The years of abuse caused the brothers to see danger differently than a normal person. And because the jurors did not have to consider the reasonable man standard, they could not legally acquit the brothers. The best verdict the brothers were entitled to was manslaughter. </P>

<P>This time, Gessler wants to argue that any reasonable person would react the same way Lyle did after hearing that his brother was about to be raped. If the jury accepts this argument, it could vote to find Lyle guilty of manslaughter.</P>

<P>One possible reason why Lyle's lawyers want to change strategy is because he might not testify at this trial. While Lyle was a sympathetic witness during the first trial, prosecutors have discovered new incriminating evidence against him. The evidence included a letter telling his former girlfriend exactly how to testify in the first trial. </P>

<P>If Lyle doesn't testify, his lawyers can't call child abuse experts to testify about his state of mind. And without the experts, it would be tough for the defense to prove that Lyle reacted like someone who had been abused his entire life. </P> 

<P>The defense must convince Judge Stanley Weisberg that the evidence supports this theory. If the judge agrees, he would instruct the jurors on the law of heat of passion. Only then could Gessler argue the theory to the jury. </P>

<P>The prosecution opposes the defense effort to recast Lyle's motives for the shootings.</P>

<h2>Trial Summary: Week 12</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from Jan. 3 - 5.</P>

<P>JANUARY 3<BR>
The trial resumed with the prosecution trying to undermine the key defense claim that Lyle and Erik Menendez feared their parents were going to shoot them.</P>

<P>Erik admitted under questioning by Deputy District Attorney David Conn that he did not actually see his father coming towards him moments before he and his brother shot their parents on August 20, 1989. Erik said the fear that his life was in danger made him believe it. </P>

<P>Conn also suggested to jurors that if Erik really thought his life was in danger, he would have looked around the living room den for guns after the killings. Erik said he did not do so until about an hour later, after returning from an alibi-establishing trip to a movie theater. </P>

<P>JANUARY 4<BR>
The continued cross-examination of Erik Menendez focused on what he told his former friend Craig Cignarelli. </P>

<P>Erik conceded that he confessed to Cignarelli that he killed his parents. But he said that he didn't tell him any details of how the killings were carried out. </P>

<P>During the first trial, Cignarelli said Erik told him that he and Lyle went into the den and found their parents sitting on the couch. Lyle shot Jose Menendez and then told Erik to "shoot Mom," according to Cignarelli's testimony. </P>

<P>Cignarelli has not been called as a witness for the retrial, but Deputy District Attorney David Conn used excerpts from his 1993 testimony to cross-examine Erik, who denied making the statements. </P>

<P>The defense was angered by the prosecution's use of Cignarelli's earlier testimony. Defense attorneys say the prosecution knew Erik would deny the statements but asked him about them anyway in order to get Cignarelli's testimony before the jury without calling him as a witness.  The prosecution did not call Cignarelli as a witness because his credibility was damaged during the first trial. Judge Stanley Weisberg ordered the prosecution to subpoena Cignarelli to at least show some intention of calling him as a rebuttal witness. But, the state is not obliged to call him and most believe he will never take the witness stand. </P>

<P>Cignarelli's testimony differs dramatically from the brothers' version of the August  20, 1989, shotgun slayings. </P>

<P>The brothers claim that right before the shootings, Lyle warned Erik, "It's happening, it's happening now" because the siblings believed their parents were on the verge of killing them. The brothers also claim their parents were standing and moving toward them at the time, and that they fired in a blind panic. </P>

<P>Also Thursday, Conn pressed Erik about why he confessed the killings to his therapist, but never told him about the molestation or the brothers' fears that their parents were going to kill them. Conn insisted  that Erik and Lyle made up the abuse and fear after they were jailed in March 1990. </P>

<P>Conn said it didn't make sense that Erik would keep the molestation from Jerome Oziel, "leaving him with the impression that you stormed into that room and killed for no good reason."</P>

<P>Erik said he was guilt-ridden about the killings, and needed to unburden himself on someone. But as for the sexual abuse, "I wanted to bury that forever."</P>

<P>JANUARY 5<BR>
There was no testimony because a juror had a family emergency. Instead, the lawyers continued arguing over whether the defense can introduce videotapes of Lyle Menendez's testimony from the first trial. </P>

<h2>Trial Summary: Week 11</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from Dec. 18 - 22.</P>

<P>DECEMBER 18<BR>
Prosecutor David Conn did what prosecutors in the first trial of Lyle and Erik Menendez  refused to do -- he challenged Erik's allegations that his father molested him.</P>

<P>Conn went so far as to challenge Erik about small details, such as why a Vaseline jar was left in his room. Erik said his father used it for sex. Conn suggested that Erik might have used it for blisters he got on his hands from playing tennis. </P>

<P>Conn attacked Erik's claims that his father forced sex on him even at age 18, when Erik had a car and plenty of money to escape. He even asked Erik why he did not join the military and "let your father take on the U.S. Army." Erik said the Army would not have been enough to protect him from his father, who was the "most powerful man I've ever met." He said his father, who feared that his sons would expose him as a child molester, would have spent his last cent tracking him down if he had run away. </P>

<P>At one point, Erik conceded that there were no living eyewitnesses to the sexual abuse, which he earlier testified occurred from age 6 until days before the slayings. </P>

<P>The day also was highlighted by Erik's revelation that he had visions of killing his father just three months before the August 20, 1989, slayings of Jose and Kitty Menendez. He said he started to wish his father was dead when he was 13 years old. And in 1988, he said he wished his mother would kill her husband with a new rifle she had purchased. </P>

<P>Prosecutors contend Erik's statements are evidence of premeditation. But defense lawyers say his truthfulness is typical of an abused person and shows jurors that he has nothing to hide. </P>

<P>Later, Conn raised the issue of Erik's sexual orientation.  Conn suggested that Erik exaggerated his involvement with women to hide his true sexuality.  Conn asked Erik if his parents ever questioned his sexuality. Erik said they did. </P>

<P>Outside of court, Conn said he wanted to show that Erik's sexuality was a source of tension in the family. </P>

<P>DECEMBER 19<BR>
Prosecutor David Conn asked Erik Menendez why he didn't consider several alternatives to killing his parents, if he were truly scared of them. </P>

<P>Why didn't you leave home, go to the police, or join the military and "let your father take on the U.S. Army," Conn asked. </P>

<P>Erik insisted that the army would never impede his father, Jose Menendez, a show business executive. </P>

<P>Conn tried to show that Erik's testimony was rife with inconsistencies and suggested several times that he was trying to win sympathy with the jury by portraying himself as a child. </P>

<P>Conn asked Erik why he left his brother with his parents on the day Lyle confronted his father about the sex abuse. When that incident allegedly occurred, Conn pointed out, less than a week before the murders, the brothers claimed they were in fear for their lives. But it wasn't until a later point that they armed themselves. </P>

<P>Court was only in session for half a day to allow a juror to make a medical appointment. </P>

<P>DECEMBER 20<BR>
Prosecutor David Conn continued to challenge Erik Menendez on every detail of the events during the week before the killings. </P>

<P>Conn repeatedly asked why Erik and his brother did not leave their parents. Erik responded  that Jose Menendez was a powerful man who would be able to find his sons wherever they went.  Conn suggested through his questions that anyone in their right mind would have seriously considered running away or going to the police. </P>

<P>Defense lawyers claim that the brothers' fears were normal reactions for people who have been battered all their lives. The brothers claim that only after shooting their parents did they realize the couple had not intended to kill them. </P>

<P>Erik also testified that he often imagined many ways in which his parents might kill him - shooting him with a gun equipped with a silencer, stabbing him, or faking that he was slain by burglars. He said he was  sure his father would kill him and avoid being arrested for murder. </P>

<P>The testimony came as Conn questioned Erik about the brothers' claims that they shot their parents because they feared that the couple was going to kill them to stop them from exposing the father as a child molester. </P>

<P>"Did you turn to your brother and say, 'This is ridiculous. Our parents can't do this and get away with it?' " Conn asked. </P>

<P>"No," Erik said. "My father could do anything."</P>

<P>During his testimony, Erik has portrayed Jose Menendez as an all-powerful figure who sexually abused him for 12 years and inflicted psychological torture on him all his life. He said his mother also physically abused him. He called her "my dad's enforcer" because she meted out punishment to her children. </P>

<P>DECEMBER 21<BR>
Prosecutor David Conn challenged Erik Menendez's claims that he was not aware of what he was doing even as he shot his parents to death. </P>

<P>Conn tried to show jurors that Erik, 25, and his brother Lyle, 27, planned the slayings days in advance, and knew exactly what they were doing when they flung open the den doors and fired nearly a dozen rounds of buckshot and birdshot into their parents on August 20, 1989. </P>

<P>"You wouldn't know. You weren't there. I was there. I'm telling you what happened,"  Erik said, in response to Conn's assertions.  "I was just so rushed and panicked, I didn't even think about (it)." </P>

<P>The brothers claim they were in a heightened state of fear, after years of abuse, and shot in a blind panic. </P>

<P>Meanwhile, Judge Stanley Weisberg ruled that Erik must submit to a psychological examination by Dr. Park Dietz. Dietz is expected to be a key rebuttal witness for the prosecution. </P>

<P>Since Erik has "tendered his mental state" as part of his defense, the judge ruled he is subject to examination by the state's expert. Judge Weisberg denied defense requests to be present during the examination and to have its own experts attend the session. </P>

<P>DECEMBER 22<BR>
The court was in recess.</P>

<H2>Trial Summary: Week 10</H2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from December 11 - December 15.</P>

<P>DECEMBER 11<BR>
The week leading up to the slayings was filled with signs that Jose and Kitty Menendez were about to do something terrible to their sons, Erik Menendez told jurors.</P>

<P>"I was sure mom and dad were going to do something, it was just a matter of when and how," Erik said, recalling the events before the August 20, 1989, slayings. The younger brother said his father angrily vowed to keep Lyle from exposing a dark family secret - that Jose Menendez had been molesting Erik since childhood.</P>

<P>The brothers have claimed a motive of imperfect self-defense, meaning that they had a genuine but misguided fear that their parents were going to kill them. </P>

<P>Erik said the week before the slayings began with alarming news from his father. Even though he had been accepted at UCLA and was moving into a dormitory, he would have to spend several nights a week at home, he said. To Erik, that meant that his father intended to keep molesting his younger son.</P>

<P>Two days later, Erik said he witnessed an angry confrontation between his mother and brother, during which Kitty Menendez pulled off Lyle's hairpiece. At first, Erik, who said he never knew Lyle wore a toupee, thought his mother had pulled Lyle's hair right out of his scalp. Later that day, Erik said, he told Lyle that their father was still abusing him. He said Lyle promised to confront their father.</P>

<P>Two days later, Erik said Lyle confronted their father and threatened to reveal the family secret unless Jose Menendez stopped the abuse. Later that night, Erik said, his father burst into his room and screamed at him for telling Lyle. Then, Erik said, his mother admitted to him that she had known about the abuse. Erik said he was devastated that she never did anything to stop it. </P>

<P>It was that night, Erik  said, that he and his brother began to think their parents would kill them. He said he and Lyle stayed awake all night and discussed whether to go to the police, talk to relatives or get weapons.</P>

<P>On August 18, 1989, Erik said he and Lyle decided to purchase handguns to protect themselves. They purchased shotguns instead because of the two-week waiting period for handguns.</P>

<P>Erik then testified about the fishing expedition the family went on the day before the killings. Erik said he and Lyle were afraid the trip was a set up by their parents to kill them. They spent the entire trip on the front of the boat - as far away from their parents as possible.</P>

<P>DECEMBER 12<BR>
Erik Menendez told jurors how he and his brother burst into the den of their Beverly Hills mansion and took five seconds to end their parents' lives.</P>

<P>He recalled that he fired first, and that his brother, Lyle, continued firing after he had emptied his shotgun. Lyle, he said, fired the shot to the back of their father's head. And Lyle, he said, reloaded and fired the final shot into their mother's face. </P>

<P>The scene Erik created for the jurors was one of utter chaos. He said he ran into the den, illuminated only by a TV set, saw the shadow of his father standing by a coffee table, and fired. He said he believed his parents were firing back. </P>

<P>Erik said he did not remember much except for the sounds -- the sounds of the shotgun blasts, the sound of shattering glass and the sounds of his dying mother.</P>

<P>"It was a sound of pain, a sound I continually hear in my mind," he told jurors.</P>

<P>Erik said that when the shooting stopped, he and brother sat in the foyer of their home mansion and waited for police to come. Minutes passed, and when they heard no sirens, the brothers decided to try an establish an alibi. They drove to a Century City movie theater, dumped the shotguns off Mulholland Drive, tossed bloody clothes in a trash bin, and drove back home.</P>

<P>When the brothers returned home, Erik went into the den while Lyle called police and went upstairs.</P>

<P>"I remember staring at my father in particular and just being in shock that my dad could die, and he was sitting in front of me, dead. I remember thinking how wrong this looked," Erik said. </P>

<P>As for his mother, he said, "I just wondered if she knew it was me, if she was scared. Did she understand? Was she hurting.? I just felt really bad, like a bad person. I just wanted to know what she had thought when I entered the room."</P>

<P>It was then that he looked for his parents' rifle. When he found none, he said he knew he had "made a mistake."</P>

<P>DECEMBER 13<BR>
Erik Menendez started testifying about his relationship and conversations with his one-time psychologist Dr. Jerome Oziel, who later provided police with enough evidence to arrest Erik and his brother for the murder of their parents.</P>

<P>Erik said he went to Oziel because he thought that killing himself was the only way to escape the guilt of shooting his parents. Erik said that when Oziel did not seem to understand his suicidal tendencies, he confessed to him on October 31, 1989. After the confession, Erik said Oziel still did not listen to his cries for help and only wanted to discuss the details of the shootings.</P>

<P>Erik also began refuting key points in the prosecution's case. He said he thought he had been disinherited before he killed his parents and it didn't really bother him. Erik said he learned he'd been written out of the will from his father, who felt that his younger son was not living up to his expectations. The prosecution claims the brothers killed for money.</P>

<P>It was only later that Erik said he learned that he and Lyle were still in their parents' will. But when the money started coming in, Erik said he was guilt-ridden, suicidal and depressed over what he had done. Erik admitted that that he bought a Jeep, a Rolex and clothes, and gambled away several thousand dollars. But he said he wasn't even sure he wanted his parents' money, and did not feel right spending it.</P>

<P>On October 31, 1989, depressed and suffering from a bad ulcer, Erik said he went on a walk with Oziel. "I said, Dr. Oziel, 'We did it,' " Erik said.</P>

<P>"I primarily wanted to hear him tell me that I was not a bad person," he said.</P>

<P>DECEMBER 14<BR>
The prosecution set out to portray Erik Menendez as a liar by pointing out that he lied for six months to police, family and friends before he and his brother were arrested for the murder of their parents.</P>

<P>Prosecutor David Conn started his cross-examination by questioning Erik's claim that he never told anyone about the sexual abuse by his father because he did not want to "let the family down."</P>

<P>"You didn't feel that you let your family down the day you shot your mother and father to death?" he asked.</P>

<P>"I didn't think about that," Erik replied, adding he did not tell about the abuse out of compassion for his dead parents and his relatives.</P>

<P>"Did you show compassion to your mother before you shot her to death...And if you have so much compassion for your grandmother, why did you shoot her son to death?" Conn asked.</P>

<P>"My compassion for my grandmother has nothing to do with my relationship with my father," Erik answered.</P>

<P>Conn spent much of the day trying to show that Erik lied repeatedly in the past and would do so again about his father molesting him. The brothers did not admit they killed their parents until after their arrest in March 1990.</P>

<P>The brothers say they shot their parents because they thought their parents were going to kill them to prevent exposing the family incest secret. Prosecutors say the brothers killed out of hatred and greed for the family's $14 million estate.</P>

<P>Erik insisted that he was not lying anymore but conceded that he did not want to spend the rest of his life in jail.</P>

<P>"A murder conviction would put me in jail for the rest of my life," he said.</P>

<P>"So, you'd rather have a manslaughter?" Conn asked.</P>

<P>"That's the only way I can go home," Erik answered.</P>

<P>Earlier in the day, Erik finished his direct testimony by explaining the circumstances  surrounding a tape-recorded therapy session with Dr. Jerome Oziel, his former psychologist. On the tape of the December 11, 1989, session, Erik and Lyle discussed the killings but did not say they shot their parents out of fear after a lifetime of abuse. </P>

<P>Instead, the brothers agreed with Oziel's assessment that they killed their father because he  was a controlling person and their mother because she wanted to die anyway. Erik said he did not tell Oziel of the abuse because he did not trust him.</P>

<P>Erik concluded his direct testimony by saying the first person he told about the sexual abuse was his priest. The priest, the Rev. Ken Deasy has been in court during Erik's testimony,.</P>

<P>DECEMBER 15<BR>
The defense indicated that it wants to play a videotape of Lyle Menendez's testimony from the first trial.</P>

<P>The videotape would allow the jury to hear the older brother's tearful testimony without subjecting him to a potentially damaging cross-examination.</P>

<P>Attorney Leslie Abramson said the defense will request the videotaped testimony in a motion next week. The prosecution is expected to object.</P>

<P>The defense strategy is to have Erik call Lyle as a witness. Lyle would invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to testify. Because Lyle would then be unavailable to testify, his previously recorded testimony should be used instead.</P>

<P>Also Friday, Judge Stanley Weisberg indicated that he may order Erik to submit to an examination by  forensic psychiatrist Dr. Park Dietz. Dietz has testified for the prosecution in numerous high-profile trials, including those of  would-be presidential assassin John Hinckley Jr. and serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. </P>

<P>Meanwhile, there was no testimony because a juror was sick.</P>

<h2>Trial Summary: Week 9</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from Dec. 4-8.</P>

<P>DECEMBER 4<br>
A prominent pathologist testified that any reconstruction of the shootings was "doomed to failure" because the victims and the assailants were moving during the incident.</P>

<P>"The falling, ducking, twisting and turning" made it so "there's no way in the world to know what someone was doing when a particular shot was fired," Dr. Cyril Wecht told jurors. </P>

<P>During his testimony, Wecht focused on one particular shot: the first shot which prosecutors said was fired while Jose and Kitty Menendez were sitting in the den of their Beverly Hills home. According to the state, shotgun pellets from the shot tore through Jose Menendez's right and left arms and then into Kitty Menendez's left breast. Wecht said the wound patterns made the state's scenario of the first shot impossible. </P>

<P>Wecht also testified about the autopsy written by Dr. Irwin Golden, the Los Angeles Deputy Medical Examiner. He vouched for Golden when the autopsy finding were at odds with the prosecution's reconstruction. But, on cross-examination, Wecht admitted that Golden's reports were replete with
inconsistencies. </P>

<P>Golden testified in the first trial that he could not say for sure how many shots were fired or the sequence of the shots that killed the couple. </P>

<P>Wecht also criticized Golden for performing the autopsies two days after the August 20, 1989, shootings. "Only in L.A.," he quipped. </P>

<P>DECEMBER 5<br>
Defense criminalist Charles Morton testified that blood patterns and shotgun pellet holes in the clothes of Jose and Kitty Menendez contradicted the prosecution's reconstruction of the crime scene. </P>

<P>Morton, a criminalist with the Institute of Forensic Science in Oakland, said the physical evidence at the scene indicated that Kitty Menendez was standing when she was shot. In addition, Morton said, the blood patterns on and around the living room couch and on Jose Menendez's clothes indicated he took all the shots, except for the one to the back of the head,  while he was standing. </P>

<P>During cross-examination, prosecutor David Conn pointed out that although Morton had criticized prosecution witness Roger McCarthy of  Failure Analysis Associates for developing a reconstruction of the shooting, Morton had offered a reconstruction of his own which supported the defense theory of the
shootings.</P>

<P>DECEMBER 6<br>
Erik Menendez took the witness stand late in the day and began what could be at least a week of testimony about why he and his brother killed their parents.</P>

<P>Defense attorney Barry Levin methodically questioned him about the alleged battering, belittling and rape he suffered at the hands of the father.</P>

<P>During his testimony, Erik created for jurors an image of a double life he led at home from the time he was six years old until he was 18:  one life inside the bedroom and the other outside the bedroom. Inside the bedroom, he testified, his father was kind, gentle, patient and loving. At the same time, his father  molested him, massaging his back and thighs, then his genitals and  performing oral copulation on him when he was six years old, Erik said. </P>

<P>"He told me that this was love," Erik said, while appearing to fight back tears. </P>

<P>But outside the bedroom, Erik testified his father was a domineering brute. He said his father would slap him, punch him and hit him with a belt. And when he cried, Erik testified, his father would hit him again. "He hated it when I cried," he testified. </P>

<P>Erik began his testimony much the same way he did during the first trial -- dealing with the ugly details of sexual abuse. His brother Lyle watched him intently during the testimony, leaning on the counsel table with his head in his hands. </P>

<P>Erik started to weave together the pieces of his life which he hopes will prove created in him a heightened state of fear of his parents -- a fear so great that he felt  he had no other choice but to kill them. </P>

<P>He said his parents were violent. His mother humiliated and degraded him. His father beat and molested him. But he said, he loved his parents. He did not kill them out of hatred, or money, or even because of the abuse, he said. </P>

<P>Instead, Erik told the jury, "we killed our parents because we were afraid." The brothers feared their parents would kill them because they threatened to reveal the alleged sexual abuse.</P>

<P>Before Erik's testimony, the jury heard from boat captain Bob Anderson and his shipmate, Leslie Gaskill, who took the Menendez family on a fishing expedition on August 19, 1989 -- one day before the shootings.</P>

<P>Although Anderson testified for the prosecution during the first trial, he became a key defense witness in this trial. He and Gaskill testified that the Menendez family seemed "gloomy" and did not interact during  the outing. </P>

<P>The defense tried to bring out exactly what it had elicited from Anderson during the first trial -- an image of Lyle and Erik, wearing only shorts, staying put huddled at the bow of the boat while the wind blew and the waves pounded the boat.  At the start of the trip, Anderson said, a large wave crashed over the front of the boat and soaked the brothers. And he said he could not understand why they stayed there freezing. The defense contends the brothers did not move because they feared the boat trip was a setup by their parents to kill them. </P>

<P>DECEMBER 7<br>
Erik Menendez continued to provide gruesome details of the abuse that made him fear his parents enough to kill them. </P>

<P>During his second day on the witness stand, he explained how he was beat, belittled, raped and threatened by his father. He detailed many of the same childhood horrors that he had on the witness stand during the first trial in 1993 - sexual abuse from ages 6 to 18, beatings and angry outbursts from his father, and name calling. </P>

<P>"Sometimes he would call me a sissy, a coward, that I wasn't worthy to be his son, that I was not a Menendez," he testified. </P>

<P>He cried as he told jurors about the continuous torture that mixed violence with sex and a son's duty to his father. As Erik cried, prosecutor David Conn became increasingly agitated and asked for a recess.  Defense attorney Barry Levin interrupted, insisting his client be allowed to continue his testimony. Judge Stanley Weisberg allowed Erik to continue his testimony. </P>

<P>Erik described how his father's "gentle, loving" sex changed suddenly one night into violent sex. His father burst into his room, slapped him against a wall, threw him off his bed and forced him to have oral sex, Erik testified. </P>

<P>Eventually, he said, his father sodomized him. </P>

<P>"It hurt me and made me very confused," Erik told the jury. "I just thought it was something I had to overcome and I would get used to it." </P>

<P>DECEMBER 8<br>
The week ended on a dramatic note when the defense showed the jury a large hunting knife allegedly used by Jose Menendez to force himself sexually on his younger son. </P>

<P>"He put his hand down on my forehead and put the knife at my throat and told me that he should kill me and next time he would," Erik Menendez said, during his third day on the witness stand. </P>

<P>Erik said the knife incident occurred when, at age 17, he finally had the strength to resist his father's sexual advances. The knife, which has a 12-inch blade, was a souvenir from a "Rambo" film. Jose Menendez's company had been involved with the movie. When the knife was brandished, Erik said he submitted to his father's wishes. </P>

<P>"How did you feel?" asked his lawyer, Barry Levin. </P>

<P>"I wanted to die," he responded. </P>

<P>As Erik continued his testimony, Judge Stanley Weisberg followed through with a threat to limit testimony about allegations of early childhood abuse. The judge rejected as irrelevant testimony about Erik becoming injured learning to ride a bicycle. </P>

<P>The judge said he would limit testimony about events that occurred so long ago that they could have little to do with the brothers' state of mind at the time they killed their parents, and warned defense attorney Levin that he would not allow the case to be turned into a trial about child abuse. </P>

<P>The defense contends that the brothers' early childhood trauma is crucial to understanding why they thought that their parents were going to kill them. </P>

<P>On Friday, Erik continued telling the jury the shocking details of events in his childhood. </P>

<P>He said his father stuck pins in him during sexual episodes and threatened to smash his skull if he told anyone. His mother, he said, drank too much, and had angry, violent outbursts.</P>

<h2>Trial Summary: Week 8</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from Nov. 27 - Dec. 1.</P>

<P>NOVEMBER 27<BR>
After an hour of testimony, a juror raised her hand and complained that she was sick. Judge Stanley Weisberg sent the jurors home. He kept the lawyers to argue over exhibits.</P>

<P>NOVEMBER 28<BR>
The sickness of a juror caused court to be canceled for the second day in a row.</P>

<P>NOVEMBER 29<BR>
A criminalist testified that engineer Roger McCarthy, who reconstructed the crime scene, reached many conclusions by ignoring much of the evidence.</P>

<P>Ron Linhart, assistant director of the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department crime lab, was the latest defense witness to rebut the reconstruction, the linchpin of the prosecution theory of the killings.</P>

<P>Linhart testified that blood spatter analysis contradicted much of the reconstruction. The blood patterns on the couch, the floor and Kitty Menendez's shoes, he said, showed that the victims must have been standing at some point during the shooting.  McCarthy of Failure Analysis Associates previously testified that Jose and Kitty Menendez were sitting down when the shooting began.</P>

<P>Linhart's testimony came after lead prosecutor David Conn accused another Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy of going out of his way to aid the defendants by attacking key prosecution evidence.</P>

<P>Dwight Van Horn, a firearms and ballistics expert, testified earlier that McCarthy's shot-by-shot reconstruction of the slayings was "junk science" because it ignored evidence in some instances and lacked it in others. Van Horn testified for the prosecution in the first trial about the type of shotguns used in the killings.</P>

<P>During cross-examination, Conn suggested Van Horn resented prosecutors using McCarthy'services instead of the sheriffs department, and was therefore biased against the prosecution. Conn accused Van Horn for looking for errors in the state's case to help the defense.</P>

<P>"Who's side are you on?" Conn shouted at one point.</P>

<P>"The side of truth," Van Horn responded.</P>

<P>NOVEMBER 30<BR>
A defense expert testified that Jose Menendez may have been standing when he was shot, contradicting testimony by a key prosecution witness.</P>

<P>Forensic scientist Charles Morton, like other defense witnesses who previously testified, said it was impossible to do a crime scene reconstruction in the case. In 1993, after examining the ballistics, blood and crime scene and autopsy photographs, he determined that a reconstruction would be virtually impossible. He went on to say that the reconstruction presented by prosecutors was "ripe with errors and false assumptions."</P>

<P>Morton, a criminalist with the Institute of Forensic Science in Oakland, said some evidence suggested   that Jose Menendez was standing when he was shot in the left leg. The victim then spun around and received the fatal wound to the head, Morton said.</P>

<P>The evidence, he said, also indicated that  Kitty Menendez may have been standing for several shots in which prosecutors contend she was lying on the floor. He pointed to blood drippings on her left tennis shoe and a broken bracelet piece flung across the room as evidence that she may not have been on the floor.</P>

<P>Whether the victims were standing or sitting is a crucial question in the retrial.  Prosecutors contend the victims were seated in the den of their Beverly Hills mansion when they were ambushed by their sons.</P>

<P>But Lyle and Erik Menendez testified at their first trial that the parents were standing when they burst into the living room den, and fired rapidly and randomly out of fear that their parents were going to kill them first.</P>

<P>DECEMBER 1<BR>
The jury did not hear any testimony. The lawyers argued over some exhibits and then attorney Leslie Abramson said she could not continue because she was sick. The court was recessed until December 4.</P>

<h2>Trial Summary: Week 7</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from Nov. 20-22.</P>

<P>NOVEMBER 20<BR>
After presenting testimony from 30 witnesses and more than 300 exhibits, the state rested its case-in-chief in the retrial of Erik and Lyle Menendez, charged with first-degree murder for gunning down their wealthy parents.</P>

<P>The cornerstone of the state's case was a computer-generated reconstruction of the August 20, 1989 slayings. The reconstruction by Failure Analysis Associates concluded that Jose and Kitty Menendez were sitting side-by-side on a couch in front of the television in the family's Beverly Hills home when they were fatally shot.</P>

<P>Prosecutors used the reconstruction to try and prove to jurors that the brothers deliberately and methodically killed their parents, and fired several shots at the knees to make the killings look like the work of the Mafia.</P>

<P>The state rested after defense attorney Leslie Abramson, representing Erik Menendez, concluded her cross-examination of Roger McCarthy who created the computer-illustrated exhibit. She accused the prosecution of taking "artistic license" in creating inaccurate diagrams.</P>

<P>The reconstruction is disputed by the defense and contradicted by the brothers' testimony in the first trial. The brothers claimed they were in a blind panic when they shot at their parents, who they said were standing.</P>

<P>The defense opened its case by calling Martin Fackler, considered one of the country's foremost experts on wound ballistics. He spent most of the day testifying that McCarthy's reconstruction could not be considered scientific because it  had too many errors. He said no one could design a reconstruction of the Menendez crime scene because there were too many variables.</P>

<P>Fackler also disputed what McCarthy described as the first shot fired at Jose and Kitty Menendez.  According to McCarthy, it struck Jose Menendez in the right arm, then the left arm and then into Kitty Menendez's left breast. Fackler said the medical evidence -- x-rays, the wound pattern, exit and entrance wounds -- showed the wounds to Jose Menendez's arms could not be connected to the wound to Kitty Menendez's breast.</P>

<P>NOVEMBER 21<BR>
A ballistics expert testified for the defense that the conclusions of an engineer who re-created the crime scene for the prosecution were "contrary to fact and frankly nonsense."</P>

<P>Martin Fackler asserted that it is wrong to assume that shotgun wounds suffered by Jose and Kitty Menendez caused great pain as prosecution witness Roger McCarthy had testified.</P>

<P>McCarthy's computer-generated reconstruction showed the parents sitting side-by-side on a couch when they were fired upon from the left. But Fackler's conclusions about the buckshot trajectories raised the possibility that the parents were standing when they were shot.</P>

<P>During a scathing cross-examination, Deputy District Attorney David Conn suggested Fackler, a surgeon and wound ballistics expert, had a vendetta against McCarthy.</P>

<P>But Fackler insisted that he only wanted to illustrate to the forensic community that engineers such as McCarthy should not be allowed to testify about medical evidence, such as wound patterns and pathology.</P>

<P>Conn also pointed out that even if Fackler had more medical expertise than McCarthy, he had not spent the time that McCarthy had on the case. Conn pressed the point by asking Fackler about every wound described in the autopsy reports. Conn was able to trip up Fackler on numerous points, showing that the witness did not know the case as well as McCarthy.</P>

<P>NOVEMBER 22<BR>
The jury heard for the first time the defense version of what happened on the night that Lyle and Erik Menendez shot their parents.</P>

<P>During redirect examination of ballistics expert Martin Fackler, defense attorney Leslie Abramson presented this scenario: </P>

<P>She told Fackler to assume that when Lyle and Erik Menendez entered the living room, their parents were standing in front of the couch, facing them. Erik moved straight ahead, shooting randomly at his parents as he moved. Lyle was on his brother's right side. He entered the room and turned to his right, firing as he moved.  The brothers shot at Jose Menendez from the right side, hitting him in the right and left arms. Then, while he was standing, he was shot in the knee. At some point, Lyle fired a contact shot to his father's head. Jose Menendez's body turned slightly and he collapsed on the couch with his feet crossed. Abramson did not elaborate on the shooting of Kitty Menendez but said she was standing when most of the shots were fired.</P>

<P>After posing the hypothetical, Abramson asked Fackler when the medical and physical  evidence at the crime scene supported this version of events. Fackler said it did.</P>

<P>The defense scenario differs sharply from the prosecution's theory that the brothers' methodically shot their parents in the den of the family's Beverly Hills home.</P>

<P>During cross-examination, Deputy District Attorney David Conn suggested to Fackler that it did not make sense that Jose Menendez was standing in front of the couch when he was shot in the back of the right arm, the left leg, and the left elbow before collapsing on the couch in a sitting position.</P>

<P>"Is it your belief he walked over to the couch and sat down?" Conn asked.</P>

<P>"He staggered, walked, rotated, turned. He got there, somehow," Fackler replied.</P>

<h2>Trial Summary: Week 6</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from Nov. 13-17.</P>

<P>NOVEMBER 13<BR>
The jury heard testimony for less than an hour. The attorneys spent the rest of the day arguing over which exhibits the prosecution would enter into evidence.</P>

<P>Due to a scheduling problem, engineer Roger McCarthy did not testify. Instead, the defense called a witness out of order. Kurt Kuhn, a Beverly Hills police department criminalist, testified that he collected the physical evidence at the murder scene. The defense called Kuhn because they believe his measurements of the Menendez family's living room den and furniture will undermine McCarthy's testimony. McCarthy said his crime scene reconstruction was based partly on the "geometry of the room."</P>

<P>NOVEMBER 14<BR>
The defense tried to show that Roger McCarthy was not qualified to testify about crime scenes.</P>

<P>Under questioning by defense attorney Charles Gessler, McCarthy conceded that he never visited a crime scene or witnessed an autopsy. He also admitted that he had never seen gunshot wounds on an actual body and did not consult with the medical examiner or criminalists before reaching his conclusions about the Menendez case.</P>

<P>McCarthy previously testified that Jose and Kitty Menendez were sitting on a couch in their home when they were fatally shot. The conclusion was based on a computer-generated reconstruction of the crime scene.</P>

<P>Then, during an intense line of questioning by attorney Leslie Abramson, McCarthy said he had never testified in a criminal case. Most of his work, he said, is for civil litigation and involves accident reconstruction for major car manufacturers. </P>

<P>McCarthy admitted that he is trying to bring in more business for his company, Failure Analysis Associates, and that he was working on the Menendez case for free. Abramson suggested that he was doing charity work for "poor (Los Angeles District Attorney) Gil Garcetti who is on a losing streak."</P>

<P>Abramson also pointed out that medical and ballistics experts, who will testify for the defense,  disagree with McCarthy's findings. Abramson also lambasted McCarthy for offering medical opinions, such as which would were post mortem and antemortem wounds, because he has no medical expertise -- he's an engineer.</P>

<P>McCarthy admitted that he never spoke with Dr. Irwin Golden, the coroner who performed the autopsies on Jose and Kitty Menendez. And, he conceded, that he had never heard of Dr. Robert Lawrence, the pathologist who testified for the prosecution, until just two weeks ago.</P>

<P>NOVEMBER 15<BR>
Defense attorney Leslie Abramson continued her attack on the credibility and reliability of key prosecution witness Roger McCarthy.</P>

<P>Abramson spent the day asking McCarthy painstakingly detailed questions about his computer-generated reconstruction of the crime scene. Prosecutors argue the reconstruction done by Failure Analysis Associates proves Erik and Lyle Menendez ambushed their parents.</P>

<P>In attacking McCarthy's bias, Abramson raised the fact that he is a close friend of Donald Vinson, a jury consultant who worked with the state on the O.J. Simpson case. Vinson is also the jury consultant in the Menendez trial. Abramson asked McCarthy whether Vinson asked him to "come down and help out poor (Los Angeles District Attorney) Gil Garcetti who was having a losing streak."</P>

<P>McCarthy answered no, but acknowledged that it was at Vinson's request that he is helping in Menendez prosecution.  McCarthy is providing his company's services free of charge. He also waived his $600-an-hour, expert-testimony fee.</P>

<P>And, Abramson also hammered away at the fact that McCarthy lacked the ballistics and medical background needed to analyze a crime scene.</P>

<P>NOVEMBER 16<BR>
Defense attorney Leslie Abramson attacked as "pure fantasy" a key prosecution witness's re-creation of the slayings of Kitty and Jose Menendez.</P>

<P>In her characteristically feisty courtroom style, Abramson said that engineer Roger McCarthy's shot-by-shot re-creation did not fit the evidence at the crime scene, conflicted with a coroner's findings, and didn't make sense.</P>

<P>She sought to ridicule his finding that Kitty Menendez was able to turn on her right side after lying flat on her back on the floor with debilitating blasts to her left leg, right arm and shoulder, and face.</P>

<P>"Aren't we way out there now, even for you? That's pure fantasy," Abramson said.</P>

<P>"It got done, somehow," McCarthy responded.</P>

<P>McCarthy's presentation featured computer-generated illustrations and is considered crucial to the prosecution's effort to convince jurors that the brothers are guilty of first-degree murder. According to the reconstruction, the first shot struck Jose and Kitty Menendez while they were sitting in the living room of their home. The defense contends that the parents were standing.</P>

<P>Abramson questioned McCarthy about his conclusions for each of 12 shotgun blasts, even questioning him about the locations of each of 27 pellets contained inside each shell.</P>

<P>NOVEMBER 17<BR>
After undergoing several days of cross-examination, witness Roger McCarthy reiterated his belief that Jose and Kitty Menendez were sitting down when they were ambushed by their sons.</P>

<P>McCarthy made the statement during re-direct examination by prosecutor David Conn. Conn's questioning followed the conclusion of defense attorney Leslie Abramson's cross-examination.</P>

<h2>Trial Summary: Week 5</h2>

<P>Trial developments from Nov. 6-10:</P>

<P>NOVEMBER 6<br>
The jury was shown dozens of gruesome photographs of the shotgunned bodies of  Jose and Kitty Menendez, as prosecutors began the final phase of their case.</P>

<P>Prosecutor David Conn called private pathologist Robert D. Lawrence to the witness stand instead of  Los Angeles County Deputy Coroner Irwin Golden who performed the autopsies and testified during the brothers' first trial. </P>

<P>Lawrence's testimony is key to the prosecution's new theory of the crime scene. The state contends Lyle and Erik Menendez executed their parents and then shot them in the legs to make the killings look like an organized crime hit.</P>

<P>Lawrence used wooden mannequins pierced with metal rods to demonstrate his conclusions about the angles of the shotgun blasts. He testified that Jose Menendez was struck four times, while Kitty Menendez was hit with nine shotgun blasts. The couple, he said,  were shot in the head and extremities but suffered no wounds to their torsos. </P>

<P>Lawrence also told the jury that Jose Menendez was seated on the sofa when he was shot, and that a shotgun wound to the thigh was inflicted after Menendez had died. The fatal shot, he said, was fired at point-blank range into the back of Jose Menendez's head. </P>

<P>Most of the shots to Kitty Menendez occurred when she was lying on the floor, and some shots to her arms, hand and shoulder indicate she may have been cowering, Lawrence said. </P>

<P>During the first trial, Golden testified that Jose Menendez was struck six times and Kitty Menendez 10 times. Golden also said he could not determine how many shots were fired or the sequence of the shots.</P>

<P>NOVEMBER 7<BR>
Defense attorney Leslie Abramson showed to jurors a blood-caked, short-sleeved shirt worn by Jose Menendez when he was killed. During cross-examination, Abramson suggested to pathologist Dr. Robert Lawrence, who testified for the prosecution, that blood patterns on the shirt indicate that the shots might not have been fired in the direction that the prosecution claims.</P>

<P>NOVEMBER 8<BR>
The prosecution's star witness took the stand in an attempt to show jurors that the brothers caught their parents by surprise as they sat in front of a television. Using high-tech illustrations and bloody autopsy photos, Roger McCarthy of Failure Analysis Associates reconstructed the August  20, 1989, slayings shot by shot.</P>

<P>NOVEMBER 9<BR>
Prosecutors presented computer-generated illustrations of the killings in an effort to show that Erik and Lyle Menendez planned the deaths of their parents.</P>

<P>Roger McCarthy of Failure Analysis Associates testified that Jose and Kitty Menendez were sitting side-by-side on a sofa in the den when they were attacked, and that the brothers aimed "kneecapping" shots at their parents to make the killings look like a Mafia hit.</P>

<P>"This does not appear to be a random shooting in the dark, but a very focused shooting with an intent to kneecap to make it look like a Mafia killing," said Deputy District Attorney David Conn.</P>

<P>McCarthy's testimony contradicted the findings of Dr. Irwin Golden, the coroner who performed the autopsies on Jose and Kitty Menendez. During the first trial, Golden testified that he could not determine how many shots were fired or the sequence of the shots.</P>

<P>The brothers maintain their parents were standing when the shooting began.</P>

<P>"I remember what I realized was my dad at some point sort of coming forward in my direction," Lyle Menendez testified. "And I remember firing at him, I believe he fell back."</P>

<P>NOVEMBER 10<BR>
The court was in recess for Veterans Day.</P>

<h2>Trial Summary: Week 4</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from October 30 - November 3.</P>

<P>OCTOBER 30<BR>
Amir Eslaminia, the former high school classmate of Erik Menendez, concluded his testimony. </P>

<P>Eslaminia underwent a brief cross-examination by defense lawyer Charles Gessler, who pointed out that Lyle Menendez did not go through with the plot to have Eslaminia lie on the witness stand. Lyle Menendez allegedly asked him to testify falsely that the brothers asked for a handgun for protection from their parents.  </P>

<P>Eslaminia did not testify during the first trial because prosecutors did not learn about the letter until after the trial ended.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, defense attorney Leslie Abramson tried to show that Erik Menendez had nothing to do with the plan.</P>

<P>She also attacked Eslaminia's credibility, pointing out that he said in a police interview that he would "lie like a dog," and had been convicted of petty theft. Abramson also recalled that Eslaminia told a Menendez relative that in the months after the killings, he was so convinced of the brothers' innocence that he offered to engineer a helicopter jailbreak. After learning that the brothers were the killers, his relationship with them cooled, Eslaminia said.</P>

<P>OCTOBER 31<BR>
Lyle Menendez told a friend about tape recorded sessions with therapist Jerome Oziel where he talks about the murder of his parents.</P>

<P>'If the police get their hands on those tapes, I'm f....d," Menendez allegedly told Glenn Stevens, the latest prosecution witness to testify about the brothers' spending habits after the killings.</P>

<P>Stevens said that Lyle Menendez told him at his parents' New Jersey wake that he and his brother had inherited the couple's entire multimillion dollar estate.</P>

<P>On a flight from New Jersey to California, Menendez gave Steven $1,400 to bail him out if he was arrested, Stevens said. They also talked about the restaurant Menendez bought after killing his parents.</P>

<P>Under cross-examination, Stevens admitted that he stole money from Menendez's restaurant, where he worked. He also said he spent the money given him for bail and sold one of Menendez's Rolex watches.</P>

<P>NOVEMBER 1<BR>
The former fiance of Lyle Menendez testified that he offered her money to lie on the witness stand.</P>

<P>Jamie Pisarcik said Lyle wanted her to say that Jose Menendez raped her. She refused the bribe and told prosecutors about it.</P>

<P>"He was asking me to get up on the stand and say his father had done something to me that he hadn't done," Jamie Pisarcik, 32, testified.</P>

<P>Prosecutors maintain that Pisarcik's testimony supports their theory that the brothers fabricated their defense.</P>

<P>Defense attorney Terri Towery cross-examined Pisarcik for five hours in an attempt to show inconsistencies from her testimony during the brothers' first trial. The defense sought to discredit Pisarcik as an opportunist who called off her engagement with Lyle Menendez once she learned that her fiance would not inherit his parents' money.</P>

<P>Pisarcik also told jurors that Lyle Menendez tearfully confessed to killing his parents when she visited him in jail after his March 1990 arrest. She said he claimed that the killings occurred because Kitty Menendez had sexually abused him, and her husband was abusing Erik.</P>

<P>NOVEMBER 2<BR>
The uncle of Lyle and Erik Menendez told jurors that the brothers' father was angry about his elder son's spending habits just two weeks before his slaying.</P>

<P>"I've got to have a major conversation with my son Lyle. He's got to get the message we're not going to be supporting them for the rest of their lives," Brian Andersen said, quoting brother-in-law Jose Menendez.</P>

<P>Andersen, the older brother of  Kitty Menendez, was among the few relatives to testify for the prosecution at the brothers' first trial.</P>

<P>In his testimony, Andersen offered new and potentially damaging evidence against the brothers. He said that in the week after the August  20, 1989 slayings, Lyle Menendez insisted that his parents' safe and safety deposit box be opened in the sole presence of him and his younger brother.</P>

<P>"He said that he was concerned there may be some things in the safe that could be embarrassing for his parents," Andersen said.</P>

<P>The prosecution claims the brothers really feared that their parents had written a new will disinheriting them and might have intended to destroy such a document. A new will was not found.</P>

<P>During cross-examination, defense lawyers tried to show that Andersen himself had financial motives for his testimony, pointing to a probate dispute involving his side of the family over the Menendez estate. The estate is now not worth anything.</P>

<P>The defense claims Andersen fabricated details - including a claim that Erik Menendez said he had received a threatening phone call from the Mafia - so that the brothers will be found guilty.</P>

<P>"You made this story up recently to get (the brothers) - didn't you, Mr. Andersen?" said Leslie Abramson.</P>

<P>NOVEMBER 3<BR>
Jose Menendez's secretary testified about Lyle Menendez's behavior on the day of his parents' funeral.</P>

<P>At the funeral, Lyle Menendez, who was wearing his father's shoes, said, "See, who says I can't fill my father's shoes. These are his shoes."</P>

<P>Prosecutors are trying to show through Marzi Eisenberg's testimony that Lyle Menendez showed little remorse at the death of his parents.</P>

<h2>Trial Summary: Week 3</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from October 23 - October 27.</P>

<P>OCTOBER 23<BR>
The prosecution continued to present evidence to support its theory that Lyle and Erik Menendez killed their parents for money, and went on a wild spending spree after the murders.</P>

<P>Jewelry saleswoman Mary Ellen Mahar testified that the brothers came to her store just four days after the killings and spent about $15,000 on three Rolex watches.</P>

<P>Under questioning by defense attorney Barry Levin, Mahar said the brothers did not act secretive about the purchases, which also included two or three money clips.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, a hearing outside the jury's presence, focused on the relationship between Amir Eslaminia and the brothers. </P>

<P>Eslaminia, a former high school classmate of Erik Menendez, testified that he befriended the brothers after they went to jail and, believing they were innocent, offered to help them in any way he could. But then, in 1991, Lyle Menendez wrote him a letter asking him to lie on the witness stand and testify that Erik had come to him for a handgun to protect himself from his father.</P>

<P>The prosecution wants to present the evidence to the jury, in an effort to show the brothers fabricated their defense that they were afraid of their parents. </P>

<P>Prosecutor David Conn said the letter, dated July 9, 1991, says, "Here is an outline of what we need. It is not crucial your story matches ours perfectly, so you need not worry."</P>

<P>The defense argues Eslaminia's testimony is inadmissible because prosecutors can not link the letter to Erik Menendez. Defense attorney Leslie Abramson also suggested that Eslaminia made up the story in exchange for help with several outstanding warrants.</P>

<P>Neither Eslaminia nor the letter played a part in the first trial. The hearing on the issue is scheduled to continue Wednesday.</P>

<P>OCTOBER 24<BR>
The brothers' former tennis coach testified that shortly after the killings, Erik Menendez hired him for $60,000 a year as a personal trainer.</P>

<P>Testifying for the prosecution, coach Mark Heffernan said that the brothers had the potential to become top- ranked tennis players, and wanted to get themselves into peak physical condition. Heffernan said he worked as long as 10 hours a day with the brothers at their homes in an exclusive condominium complex in Marina del Rey.</P>

<P>Heffernan also said Erik purchased a jeep after the killings, as the prosecution continued to present evidence of the brothers' spending habits after the deaths of their parents.</P>

<P>According to Heffernan, Erik Menendez stuck with the coach's highly structured program for several months before his arrest in March 1990, following his return from a juniors tennis tournament in Israel. But Lyle, who had a good shot at becoming a top-ranked player,  lost interest in tennis in favor of business pursuits in New Jersey, Heffernan said.</P>

<P>Defense attorneys tried to diminish the impact of Heffernan's testimony, pointing out that he also coached the brothers for wages before the killings, and suggesting that his salary was not exorbitant. The defense also got Heffernan to discuss how Jose Menendez forced his sons to follow an impossibly demanding tennis schedule.</P>

<P>The day's other testimony came from Amanda Grier, the sporting goods saleswoman who sold two, 12-gauge Mossberg shotguns to Erik Menendez two days before the August 20, 1989 murders. Grier testified that Erik used a fake identification, belonging to Lyle Menendez's former friend Donovan Goodreau, in making the purchase.</P>

<P>OCTOBER 25<BR>
Prosecutors announced that Dr. Irwin Golden, the coroner who performed the autopsies on Kitty and Jose Menendez, will not testify in the trial.</P>

<P>Golden testified in the first trial that he could not say for sure how many shots were fired or the sequence of the shots that killed the couple. Instead, prosecutor David Conn wants to call a new witness whose testimony is at odds with Golden. Dr. Roger McCarthy has reconstructed the shootings and says he can determine the sequence of shots -- a sequence that shows premeditation and deliberation. </P>

<P>It is virtually unheard of not to call the coroner in a murder trial and the defense says if the prosecution does not call Golden, it will. </P>

<P>Golden performed the autopsies in the O.J. Simpson case but prosecutors did not have him testify because of the mistakes he made on the autopsies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, a witness testified that Lyle Menendez blamed underworld crime figures for his parents' slayings, and told a security firm that he feared the killers would come after him and his brother.</P>

<P>"He believed it was either the Colombia cartel or the mob - meaning the Mafia," said Richard Wenskoski, Lyle Menendez's bodyguard for a week after the slayings. </P>

<P>Despite his concerns, Lyle Menendez didn't appear to take his safety seriously, the bodyguard said. He had a habit of jumping out of the limousine he rode around New York City and New Jersey and running into clothing and sporting goods stores, leaving his bodyguards behind, Wenskoski said.</P>

<P>He testified that Lyle spent as much as $3,000 a time on his shopping trips. "He seemed carefree," Wenskoski said. "I never seen him cry over his parents."</P>

<P>Prosecutors argue that the bodyguards were part of the brothers' plan to make police think the killings were a mob hit. The scheme included shooting the parents in the knees, Mafia-style, prosecutors allege.</P>

<P>Wenskoski said Lyle Menendez told him about a week after he was hired that his services no longer were needed. "He said his uncle had made a deal with (the Mob) and his brother and him are safe now," Wenskoski said.</P>

<P>Defense attorney Charles Gessler tried to discredit Wenskoski by pointing out that the bodyguard went to a topless bar in Los Angeles with an investigating officer in the case, around the time of the first trial, but denied it in court. Wenskoski said that he denied going to a topless bar with Les Zoeller because, "this was more like a burlesque show we went to."</P>

<P>In other testimony, real estate agent Valerie Hart testified about a $900,000 condominium at the Marina City Club that the brothers discussed buying. </P>

<P>OCTOBER 26<BR>
Prosecutors introduced notes allegedly related to an escape plan, which were found among papers seized in 1990 from Lyle Menendez's jail cell. </P>

<P>Although attorneys in the case have long referred to the documents as "escape plans," Judge Stanley  Weisberg did not allow proesecutor Carol Najera to call them that in front of the jury. As a result, two sheriffs department deputies only were allowed to testify about finding the papers. </P>

<P>The documents were not shown to the jurors. Prosecutors may show them during closing arguments, at which time, they can argue that the documents were escape plans.</P>

<P>The documents, which were not introduced during the first trial, contain the following entries:</P>

<P>"Change name. Change appearance. Plastic surgeon." </P>

<P>"Need silencer. Need finances. How transfer money? How communicate overseas?" </P>

<P>Another sheet lists "Key Questions," which include the following: </P>

<P>"Where is destination? Lebanon? "Can we blend in? how?" </P>

<P>"Can we eventually move?" </P>

<P>"Can we own properties--businesses?" </P>

<P>OCTOBER 27<BR>
The prosecution attacked the credibility of the brothers by introducing  portions of a letter in which Lyle Menendez allegedly asked a potential defense witness to testify falsely that the brothers asked for a handgun for protection from their parents. </P>

<P>"Here is an outline of what you need," Lyle Menendez allegedly wrote, instructing Amir Eslaminia to say that he gave the gun to his brother Erik the day before the August 20, 1989, shotgun slayings of their parents.</P>

<P>The letter was sent to Eslaminia, a former high schools classmate of Erik, who befriended the brothers after the murders. The letter was found by police during a search earlier this year.</P>

<P>Eslaminia, whose own father was slain in 1984 during an extortion plot by the infamous Billionaire Boys Club, told the jury that he visited the brothers in jail. The visits, Eslaminia testified, "eventually culminated in a idea of  (Lyle) that I would render testimony that would be beneficial to his defense." </P>

<P>The defense vigorously tried to keep the letter out of the trial. Defense attorney Leslie Abramson argued that Erik Menendez did not know about the letter, and therefore it should not be used against him.</P>

<P>The law states that a co-defendant's out-of-court statements can not be introduced if they implicate the other defendant. But prosecutors successfully argued that the brothers participated in a conspiracy to fabricate evidence. Based on the testimony of Detective Les Zoeller, who said Eslaminia told him that Erik knew about it, Judge Stanley Weisberg allowed the letter in against both defendants.</P>

<P>The seven-page letter, dated July 9, 1991, offered detailed instructions. It began:</P>

<P>"You receive a call at your house on August 19, late morning. It was Erik. He sounded very nervous. He asked you if he could meet you outside your apartment to talk with his brother Lyle...We arrived 20 minutes alter in Erik's maroon Ford Escort. It's a two door and Erik was driving. You sat alone in the back. The car was messy. There were all kinds of clothes, shoes and tennis rackets that you pushed behind your seat...</P>

<P>"Erik said we were in great danger and needed two handguns. Both of use seemed jumpy, rushed and nervous. You asked why they were in danger. Erik said he couldn't say why but you would have to trust him...</P>

<P>"Lyle said, 'You don't understand. We don't have time to explain, can you help us or not?' It was clear to you by his tone of voice that he was very serious and afraid..."</P>

<P>The letter continued the scenario: The three drove back to the house. Lyle took the handgun, and said he would be in touch, and the brothers drove off. </P>

<P>"You told nobody about the incident and you were very nervous that we were in trouble. The gun you gave us was loaded... When you heard about our parents' deaths, you were shocked and you realized Lyle and Erik were right, there was real danger." </P>

<P>Two days after the slayings, according to the letter, Erik returned the gun. He still seemed nervous, the letter stated, but said "he and Lyle would be fine, it was obvious whoever it was only wanted his parents." </P>

<h2>Trial Summary: Week 2</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from October 16 - October 20.</P>

<P>OCTOBER 16<BR>
The jury listened to the audiotape of the 911 call Lyle Menendez made to police about 90 minutes after he and his brother killed their parents on August 20, 1989. On the tape, the brothers are heard screaming and crying, and at one point, Lyle said, "someone shot my mom and dad."</P>

<P>After hearing the tape, the jurors heard testimony from Beverly Hills police officer Michael Butkus, who was the first officer at the crime scene. He said the brothers ran out of their house screaming and crying. After Butkus said he ordered the brothers to the ground, the brothers beat their fists on the ground and shouted, "Oh my God. Oh my God. someone shot our parents. Go in and look."</P>

<P>Deputy District Attorney David Conn said earlier in the trial that the brothers spun a web of lies after the killings, and "turned on the tears" so that they would not be suspected.</P>

<P>Earlier, defense attorney Leslie Abramson concluded her cross-examination of detective Les Zoeller. Zoeller conceded that he did not know anything about the circumstances surrounding the audiotape of a session between the brothers and their former therapist Jerome Oziel.</P>

<P>OCTOBER 17<BR>
The tennis coach of Erik Menendez testified that Jose Menendez was a strict parent who controlled many aspects of his sons' lives but showed them little affection. </P>

<P>Perry Berman said Jose Menendez often criticized Lyle's taste in women and discouraged his sons from speaking at the dinner table unless they were spoken to. Berman's testimony was similar to that of his testimony during the first trial. There was one difference: Judge Stanley Weisberg limited the scope of defense attorney Terri Towery's cross-examination of Berman, throwing out as irrelevant some questions probing recollections that cast the father in a negative light.</P>

<P>At one point in the testimony, Berman described Jose Menendez as an overbearing tennis parent who once ran onto the court during a lesson and angrily yelled that the practice session was too easy.  Berman said Erik, then 15, responded: "My dad is not going to be happy until I'm running like a dog all over this tennis court."</P>

<P>Berman was called by the prosecution to talk about a rendezvous the brothers had arranged with him the night of the killings. Prosecutors maintain that the brothers intended the meeting as an alibi.</P>

<P>OCTOBER 18<BR>
The prosecution started to present evidence to support its theory that greed motivated the brothers to kill their parents.</P>

<P>The wife of a probate attorney testified that less than 24 hours after gunning down their parents, Lyle and Erik Menendez hauled a safe to the attorney's home in the hopes of finding the wealthy couple's will inside.</P>

<P>"(It was) a good-sized safe, but the two of them managed to carry it" to the Beverly Hills home of attorney Randolph Wright on the evening after the August 20, 1989, killings, said Wright's wife, Klara.</P>

<P>Wright was the first witness who did not testify in the brothers' first trial.  Prosecutors said they didn't know about the safe until after the first trial ended.</P>

<P>Klara Wright said the safe was not opened until a day or two after the killings, allowing time for two of the brothers' uncles - Brian Anderson and Carlos Baralt - to be present. It turned out the safe was empty.</P>

<P>OCTOBER 19<BR>
Probate attorney Randy Wright testified that within 24 hours of the murders, Lyle and Erik Menendez sought his advice on where to find their parents' will.</P>

<P>On the day after the August 20, 1989 murders, Wright said the brothers carried their parents' safe to his home and that Erik spent the night in the guest room with the safe. The next day, the brothers along with their uncle, Carlos Baralt, took the safe into Wright's garage and opened it to see if they could find a new will.</P>

<P>The prosecution argues the brothers were concerned that a new will would show that they had been disinherited. It turned out that the safe was empty.</P>

<P>Baralt then testified that two months before the killings, Jose Menendez told him that he wanted to disinherit his sons. Jose Menendez never wrote a new will before he was killed. </P>

<P>Prosecutors explored a line of questioning with Baralt that was not pursued during the first trial. Prosecutor David Conn asked Baralt if he knew of any evidence  that Jose Menendez sexually assaulted his sons. Baralt said no.</P>

<P>OCTOBER 20<BR>
The judge rejected a defense motion for a mistrial after attorney Leslie Abramson accusing a prosecutor of improperly asking a witness whether Jose Menendez had complained that Erik Menendez had been "in  trouble."</P>

<P>Abramson objected that prosecutor David Conn's question referred to burglary charges brought against  Erik Menendez as a juvenile in 1988 over thefts from two homes in Calabasas. Erik Menendez pleaded guilty to those charges and was placed on probation, but the incidents had not yet been deemed admissible in the brothers' second trial for the 1989 slayings of their parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez.</P>

<P>"To use the word 'trouble' in front of this jury without seeking permission is misconduct," Abramson told Judge Stanley Weisberg in a brief hearing outside the jury's presence.</P>

<P>But Conn argued that Abramson had "opened the door" to the question by asking the witness, Carlos Baralt, why his brother-in-law, Jose Menendez, had talked of disinheriting Erik. </P>

<P>Judge Weisberg sustained Abramson's objection after Baralt said that Jose Menendez had made no mention of the burglary case against Erik. But he denied the request for a mistrial.</P>

<P>Baralt previously testified that he had been close to Jose Menendez and served as executor of the couple's estate. He said that the only wills ever found named Erik and Lyle as the sole beneficiaries, entitling them to all of the family's assets.</P>

<P>But he also testified that Jose Menendez had discussed disinheriting his sons. Baralt testified that Jose Menendez told him he was disappointed that Lyle was failing academically at Princeton University. Baralt said Jose Menendez was disappointed in Erik because he lacked talent, toughness and forcefulness.</P>

<P>In other testimony, computer technician Howard Witkin testified -- as he did in the first trial -- that the brothers asked him to search their family computer for a document called "will." </P>

<h2>Trial Summary: Week 1</h2>

<P>Developments in the retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez from October 11-October 13.</P>

<P>OCTOBER 11<BR>
Erik and Lyle Menendez were motivated by greed when they ambushed their parents in the family's Beverly Hills home more than six years ago, a prosecutor charged during the first day of the brothers' retrial.</P>

<P>"The defendants stood to inherit their family's fortune," Deputy District Attorney David Conn told jurors during his opening statement. "They were trying to get their hands on their parents' money."</P>

<P>But defense attorney Leslie Abramson dismissed the greed motive during her opening statement.</P>

<P>Abramson, who represents Erik Menendez, said the brothers killed out of "mind-numbing, adrenaline-pumping fear"  that their parents would kill them first for threatening to expose a highly dysfunctional family's secrets. When Erik told Lyle days before the slaying that their father had been molesting him for 12 years, "he told the most shameful of family secrets--the incest secret," Abramson said.</P>

<P>Lyle Menendez's lead attorney, Charles A. Gessler, did not get a chance to address the jury. He's expected to give his opening statement Thursday.</P>

<P>Prosecutors are seeking first-degree murder convictions and the death penalty for the August 20, 1989 slayings of Jose and Kitty Menendez.</P>

<P>Conn opened the state's case by showing jurors gruesome autopsy and crime scene photos. The brothers, he said, "burst into the room with shotguns and began shooting their parents to death...Hundreds of shotgun pellets tore into the bodies of Kitty and Jose Menendez. We will show that they were ambushed in a storm of gunfire...Kitty and Jose Menendez had no means whatsoever to defend themselves against this barrage.There was no place to hide. There was no time to run."</P>

<P>Conn told the jurors that shortly before the killings, the brothers who lived on an allowance and credit cards started to despair that they would never get their hands on their parents' money. Jose Menendez was unhappy with his sons and threatened to write them out of his will, Conn said.</P>

<P>Within 24 hours of the murder, Conn continued, the brothers "were carrying their dead parents' safe to the home of a probate attorney. The defendants stood to inherit their family's fortune. They were trying to get their hands on their parents' money."</P>

<P>The brothers' first trial ended in deadlock last year with separate juries split between murder and manslaughter charges.</P>

<P>Abramson reminded jurors that they will be asked to decide between murder and manslaughter. "Manslaughter is all we're asking of you," she said. </P>

<P>The defense contends the brothers had an irrational fear that their lives were in danger, and are asking for manslaughter convictions under a legal concept known as the "imperfect self-defense."</P>

<P>"We will prove to you Erik was tortured, terrorized, exploited, molested and abused to such a state he lived in a constant state of fear of his parents and believed both of them would and could have killed him," Abramson told the jurors.</P>

<P>Abramson said the lights were out when the brothers walked into the family room, carrying shotguns, after an argument with their parents. Erik saw a shadowy figure in the blue haze of the television set, she said, and the image flashed him back to his father's  shadow haunting his door each time he had been molested as a child. He fired randomly, in a blind panic, she said.</P>

<P>OCTOBER 12<BR>
Lyle and Erik Menendez killed their parents not out of greed but because they feared their parents' "supernatural powers," an attorney for Lyle Menendez told jurors.</P>

<P>Completing opening statements, Charles Gessler said the brothers began to believe their parents had such powers and were planning to kill their children.</P>

<P>The brothers have admitted killing their parents but said they were driven to it after years of physical and sexual abuse. They are being retried because their first trial before two separate juries ended with both panels deadlocked.</P>

<P>Gessler said the brothers became terrified the week before the killings because their parents seemed to "know everything" about their sons' activities. "Mr and Mrs Menendez were pretending to have supernatural powers," he said. "Really, they learned through bugging the phones and other means."</P>

<P>He noted that Jose and Kitty Menendez were hit by 11 shotgun blasts, indicating "overkill that speaks of the fear that was involved here."</P>

<P>The prosecution theory that the brothers wanted their parents' money was wrong because Erik and Lyle thought at the time that they had been disowned, Gessler told the court.</P>

<P>OCTOBER 13<BR>
The jury heard tapes of the brothers admitting to their therapist that they killed their wealthy parents.</P>

<P>"There was no way I was going to kill my parents without Erik's consent," Lyle, 27, told his former therapist Jerome Oziel. "I wanted (Erik) to sleep on it a couple of days."</P>

<P>Erik, 24, later told Oziel: "I couldn't live with (my parents) anymore...I didn't have a choice to do what I did... I hate myself for it."</P>

<P>The defense objected to the playing of the Oziel tapes, saying the brothers had been manipulated into confessing.</P>

<P>In earlier testimony,  prosecutor David Conn played a taped of a Beverly Hills police detective's interview with the brothers about a month after the August 1989 slayings. The brothers said they were not having  problems with their parents, and attempted to establish an alibi.</P>

VAN NUYS, CALIFORNIA; TUESDAY, JULY 2, 1996
9:35 A.M.
DEPARTMENT NW "N"
HON. STANLEY M. WEISBERG, JUDGE
(APPEARANCES AS HERETOFORE NOTED.)
(MARILYN A. FADALE, OFFICIAL REPORTER.)
(MARY LU MURPHY, OFFICIAL REPORTER.)

THE COURT: IN THE CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS
MENENDEZ, THE DEFENDANTS ARE IN COURT WITH THEIR
LAWYERS. THE PEOPLE ARE REPRESENTED.

THE MATTER IS HERE FOR POST-TRIAL
MOTIONS AND SENTENCING.

IN THIS MATTER THE DEFENDANTS WERE EACH
CONVICTED BY JURY ON MARCH THE 20TH, 1996 OF THREE
COUNTS. COUNTS 1 AND 2 WERE VERDICTS OF GUILTY OF
MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE WITH A FINDING OF SPECIAL
CIRCUMSTANCES. THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES WERE
MURDER WHILE LYING IN WAIT AND MULTIPLE MURDER.

AND THE THIRD COUNT WAS A VERDICT OF
GUILTY OF CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MURDER ON APRIL THE
17TH. THE PENALTY PHASE OF THE JURY TRIAL WAS
COMPLETED WITH A JURY VERDICT OF LIFE IN PRISON
WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE, AND THE MATTER
HAS BEEN CONTINUED TO TODAY'S DATE FOR PURPOSES OF
HEARING ANY LEGAL MOTIONS AND TO IMPOSE IMPOSITION
OF SENTENCE.

DO COUNSEL WAIVE ARRAIGNMENT FOR
JUDGMENT?

MS. ABRAMSON: YES, YOUR HONOR.

MR. GESSLER: YES, YOUR HONOR.

THE COURT: IS THERE ANY LEGAL CAUSE WHY
SENTENCE SHOULD NOT NOW BE PRONOUNCED?

MR. GESSLER: THERE IS A MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL
THAT IS PENDING, YOUR HONOR.

THE COURT: OKAY. I HAVE RECEIVED THAT
MOTION. I'VE REVIEWED IT. THERE WAS ALSO
OPPOSITION BY THE DEFENSE -- BY THE PROSECUTION,
RATHER.

IS THERE ANYTHING FURTHER IN ADDITION TO
WHAT WAS PUT IN THE WRITTEN MOTION THAT THE DEFENSE
WISHES TO ARGUE?

MR. GESSLER: NO, YOUR HONOR. I THINK THAT
THE WRITTEN MOTION COVERS THE POINTS, AS WELL AS ALL
ARGUMENTS MADE TO THE COURT ON VARIOUS LEGAL MOTIONS
AS THE TRIAL WAS PROCEEDING, AND WE WOULD SUBMIT ON
THAT.

THE COURT: OKAY. AS FAR AS THE CODEFENDANT,
ERIK MENENDEZ?

MS. ABRAMSON: YOUR HONOR, I WOULD ALSO
INCLUDE THAT THE MOTION IS BASED NOT ONLY ON RULINGS
OF THIS COURT DURING TRIAL, BUT ALSO PRETRIAL TO THE
RETRIAL, DURING THE COURSE OF THE FIRST TRIAL, AND
PRETRIAL TO THE FIRST TRIAL.

AND WITH THAT WE WOULD ALSO SUBMIT IT ON
THE WRITTEN MOTION.

THE COURT: ALL RIGHT. THERE ARE TWO FACETS
OF THE MOTION. FIRST IS PURSUANT TO SECTION 1181.5,
DEALING WITH VARIOUS ISSUES THAT ARE ENUMERATED IN
THE DEFENSE MOTION, ISSUES THAT AROSE, AS COUNSEL
INDICATED, BEFORE THE FIRST TRIAL, BEFORE THE SECOND
TRIAL, DURING THE FIRST TRIAL, AND DURING THE SECOND
TRIAL, ALL OF WHICH DEAL WITH LEGAL RULINGS OF THE
COURT.

EACH ONE OF THOSE RULINGS WAS THE
PRODUCT OF EXTENSIVE LITIGATION IN THE COURT. THE
ISSUES WERE EXTENSIVELY BRIEFED AND ARGUED. THE
COURT EXPLAINED ITS RULINGS AT THE TIME ON EACH AND
EVERY ISSUE.

THE COURT IS SATISFIED THAT EACH OF THE
RULINGS MADE BY THE COURT WAS A CORRECT RULING; AND
THERE IS NO BASIS, THEREFORE, FOR THE GRANTING OF A
MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL ON THE GROUNDS STATED IN 1181.5
OF THE PENAL CODE.

THE OTHER BASIS OF A MOTION FOR NEW
TRIAL IS THAT SET FORTH IN PENAL CODE SECTION
1181.6. THAT'S A MOTION TO MODIFY OR REDUCE THE
VERDICT. THIS IS ALSO ARGUED IN THE WRITTEN
MATERIALS IN THE MOTION FILED BY THE DEFENSE.

DID YOU WISH TO ARGUE THAT FURTHER?

MR. GESSLER: WE SUBMIT THAT ON THE DOCUMENTS
ALSO, YOUR HONOR.

MS. ABRAMSON: WE JOIN, YOUR HONOR.

THE COURT: OKAY. THE COURT IS CALLED UPON
TO INDEPENDENTLY REVIEW THE RECORD IN THIS CASE TO
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE VERDICT OF THE JURY IS
SUPPORTED BY ADEQUATE EVIDENCE. AND THE COURT IS
SATISFIED THAT AS TO EACH COUNT, AS TO EACH FINDING
OF THE JURY, AS TO THE VERDICTS IN THIS CASE, THAT
THE VERDICTS ARE AMPLY SUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE
PRESENTED IN THIS CASE, AND THERE'S NO BASIS FOR
THIS COURT, AND THE COURT FINDS NO REASON, TO MODIFY
OR REDUCE THE VERDICTS.

IS THERE ANY OTHER LEGAL CAUSE WHY
SENTENCE SHOULD NOT NOW BE PRONOUNCED?

MS. ABRAMSON: THERE IS THE MATTER OF THE
OTHER MOTION WE FILED CONCERNING ERRORS IN THE
PROBATION OFFICER'S REPORT THAT ARE NOT DUE TO THE
PROBATION OFFICER, BUT TO INFORMATION THAT WAS
RELAYED TO HIM BY OTHERS.

WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT REPORT
CORRECTED, IF THE COURT AGREES WITH OUR POSITION ON
SOME OF THESE ITEMS, BEFORE IT BECOMES THE OFFICIAL
PROBATION REPORT THAT WILL BE TRANSMITTED TO THE
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS.

THE COURT: OKAY.

MS. ABRAMSON: AND FOR A PORTION -- IF THE
COURT IS INCLINED TO DO AN ANALYSIS OF THE REPORT
ITEM BY ITEM, AS WE LAID OUT IN OUR MOTION, I WOULD
ASK THAT AT LEAST A PORTION OF THE HEARING BE HELD
IN CAMERA OUT OF THE PRESENCE OF THE PUBLIC OR THE
MEDIA.

THE COURT: THAT REQUEST IS DENIED AS FAR AS
TO HOLD ANY HEARINGS IN CAMERA ON THIS SUBJECT. THE
REQUEST IS TO MODIFY CERTAIN STATEMENTS IN THE
PROBATION REPORT FOR EACH DEFENDANT. MOST OF THESE
REQUESTS DEAL WITH BOTH REPORTS JOINTLY. THERE ARE
PERHAPS ONE OR TWO ITEMS THAT RELATE TO ONE REPORT
AND NOT THE OTHER. BUT PRIMARILY THESE ARE ISSUES
THAT RELATE TO BOTH. AND I'M PREPARED TO DEAL WITH
THEM. CERTAINLY IF THERE ARE MATERIAL FACTUAL
INACCURACIES IN THE PROBATION OFFICER'S REPORT, THEN
THEY SHOULD BE CORRECTED TO ACCURATELY REFLECT WHAT
HAS TRANSPIRED IN THIS CASE.

GOING TO THE HEART OF YOUR MOTION HERE,
PAGE 2, THE OBJECTION TO THE REFERENCE OF HAVING
STOLEN THE DRIVER'S LICENSE.

THE EVIDENCE IS IT WAS LEFT BEHIND AND
APPROPRIATED BY THE DEFENDANTS AND KEPT. STOLEN IS
A WAY OF DESCRIBING MISAPPROPRIATION, AND I DON'T
FIND THAT IS AN INACCURATE STATEMENT; THEREFORE,
THAT REQUEST IS DENIED.

AS TO ITEM NO. 2 IN THE MOTION,
REFERRING TO THE SIZE OF BUCKSHOT, I THINK IT'S
CORRECT TO SAY THAT THE SIZE OF SHOT IN THIS CASE,
THE BUCKSHOT, WAS NO. 4 BUCKSHOT, RATHER THAN DOUBLE
OUGHT BUCKSHOT; THEREFORE, BOTH REFERENCES ON PAGE 2
WOULD BE CORRECTED TO DELETE THE WORDS, OR THE
NUMERALS DOUBLE OUGHT, ZERO, ZERO, AND IN PLACE
THEREOF PUT IN NO. 4.

THAT'S ON LINE 21, AND LINE 25.

MS. TOWERY: LINE 22, YOUR HONOR.

THE COURT: I'M SORRY?

MS. TOWERY: I THINK IT'S LINE 22.

THE COURT: MINE SHOWS 21.

MS. ABRAMSON: WELL, IT DEPENDS ON WHICH
REPORT.

THE COURT: OKAY. ON THE ERIK MENENDEZ
REPORT IT'S 21, AND --

MS. ABRAMSON: LINE 25.

THE COURT: -- ON THE LYLE MENENDEZ REPORT
IT'S 25 AND 22.

MS. ABRAMSON: RIGHT.

THE COURT: THE NEXT REFERENCE -- AS FAR AS
THE NUMBER OF SHOTS LOADED, THERE WERE A CERTAIN
NUMBER OF SHOTS FIRED. AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE
WERE FIVE OR MORE LOADED INITIALLY, VERSUS WHAT WAS
ALREADY IN THE WEAPON, DID COUNSEL WISH TO BE HEARD
ON THAT FURTHER? WHAT IS THE PEOPLE'S POSITION ON
THAT?

MR. CONN: WE WOULD SUBMIT IT, YOUR HONOR.

THE COURT: DID YOU WISH TO BE HEARD?

MR. GESSLER: YES. WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE
THAT MODIFIED TO THE LANGUAGE CONTAINED IN OUR
MOVING PAPERS BECAUSE THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT IT
WAS FIVE SHOTS. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IT WAS FIVE
ROUNDS.

THE COURT: LET'S JUST DELETE THE REFERENCE
TO THE NUMBER OF SHOTS.

MR. GESSLER: THAT'S FINE.

THE COURT: JUST REMOVE THE REFERENCE TO
"FIVE."

MR. GESSLER: THAT WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT.

THE COURT: ALL RIGHT. I'M MODIFYING EACH
REPORT BY DELETING THE REFERENCE TO "FIVE."

MR. GESSLER: I THINK PROBABLY EACH NEEDS TO
BE PERHAPS -- SO IT WOULD READ: "THE DEFENDANTS
LOADED THEIR GUNS."

MS. ABRAMSON: EACH LOADED THEIR GUNS.

THE COURT: THE DEFENDANTS LOADED THEIR GUNS
WITH ROUNDS OF NO. 4 BUCKSHOT, BUCK EACH, NO. 4
BUCK.

MS. ABRAMSON: IT'S NOT THE BEST ENGLISH, BUT
IT'S ENGLISH.

THE COURT: OKAY. AND THE NEXT REFERENCE
OBJECTED TO BY THE DEFENSE IS ON PAGE 2, LINE 27.

MS. ABRAMSON: YES. THAT'S CORRECT, YOUR
HONOR.

THE COURT: AS TO THE VICTIM JOSE MENENDEZ
MAY HAVE BEEN ASLEEP AT THE TIME.

DID THE PEOPLE WISH TO BE HEARD ON THAT?

MR. CONN: NO, YOUR HONOR.

THE COURT: DOES THAT MEAN YOU DON'T OBJECT
TO THIS BEING REMOVED?

MR. CONN: NO.

THE COURT: ALL RIGHT. THEN THAT WILL BE
REMOVED FROM THE REPORT AS TO EACH DEFENDANT.

THE NEXT REFERENCE ON PAGE 3, LINE 5 HAS
TO DO WITH THE NUMBER OF ROUNDS RETRIEVED. THERE
MAY WELL HAVE BEEN TESTIMONY THAT MORE THAN ONE
ROUND WAS PICKED UP FROM THE VEHICLE. BUT ONE ROUND
WAS GIVEN TO THE DEFENDANT, LYLE MENENDEZ, WHICH
ENDED UP IN HIS WEAPON.

WHAT IS THE PEOPLE'S POSITION AS TO
THIS, AS TO TWO OR ONE ON LINE 5, PAGE 3?

MR. CONN: WE WOULD ASK THAT IT READ "ONE OR
TWO ROUNDS OF BIRD SHOT."

MS. ABRAMSON: AND THE "RETRIEVE" PART WE
DON'T OBJECT TO, SO LONG AS THE NEXT SENTENCE IS "HE
GAVE A ROUND."

THE COURT: OKAY. "ONE OR TWO WAS RETRIEVED."

"ONE OR TWO WERE RETRIEVED."

MS. ABRAMSON: THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN, THE
CODEFENDANT'S CAR -- WHERE THE DEFENDANT RETRIEVED
ONE OR TWO SHELLS OF BIRD SHOT, I THINK THAT READS.

MS. TOWERY: IT SHOULD SAY "HE GAVE ONE SHELL."

MS. ABRAMSON: "HE GAVE ONE SHELL." DOES THE
COURT APPROVE OF THAT?

THE COURT: "HE GAVE ONE SHELL."

MS. ABRAMSON: AND THEN THE NEXT PART, WHICH
IS THE MORE CRUCIAL PART, YOUR HONOR, THAT SHOULD
THEN READ: "AND SHOT VICTIM KITTY IN THE FACE AT
POINT-BLANK RANGE."

I THINK IT WOULD --

MR. GESSLER: STRIKING THE WORD "TWICE."

THE COURT: WHAT IS THE PEOPLE'S POSITION ON
THAT? THE EVIDENCE WAS THAT THERE WAS ONE SHOT AT
POINT-BLANK RANGE, AS I RECALL.

MR. CONN: I THINK THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT WAS
IN DISPUTE. I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO SIMPLY SAYING
THAT HE SHOT THE VICTIM IN THE FACE.

THE COURT: JUST REMOVING "TWICE"?

MR. CONN: YES.

THE COURT: OKAY. THAT WILL BE DELETED.

AS FAR AS PAGE 8, LINE 6...

MS. ABRAMSON: THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE
CHARACTERIZATION OF THE INTOXICANT USED AND THE
DEGREE, THAT THAT WOULD INDICATE WHETHER IT'S
SIGNIFICANT OR NOT.

MS. TOWERY: I THINK ON THE LYLE MENENDEZ
REPORT IT'S ON PAGE 7.

THE COURT: OKAY. AS TO EACH OF THESE, THIS
IS JUST THE PROBATION OFFICER'S OPINION. YOU'RE
ASKING ME TO SAY THAT HIS OPINION ISN'T WORTH AS
MUCH AS YOUR OPINION. BUT THIS IS JUST HIS
OPINION.

MS. ABRAMSON: YOUR HONOR, HE IS IN COURT,
AND WE WOULD LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK MR. MC
MILLEN WHY HE SELECTED THAT CATEGORIZATION VERSUS
OCCASIONALLY SOCIAL OR EXPERIMENTAL USE OF. MAYBE
THERE'S SOME PROBATION GUIDELINE.

THE COURT: I'M NOT GOING TO CONDUCT A
HEARING WHERE WE QUESTION THE PROBATION OFFICER.
HIS REPORT IS HERE AND HE'S WRITTEN IT. IF HE WANTS
TO MODIFY IT HE CAN DO SO. BUT THIS IS HOW HE
CHARACTERIZED THIS, FOR WHATEVER HIS REASONS WERE.

MS. ABRAMSON: WE'D LIKE TO HOLD ON THAT,
YOUR HONOR, AND HAVE A BREAK AND DISCUSS IT WITH THE
PROBATION OFFICER.

THE COURT: I'LL CERTAINLY LET YOU DO THAT.
AND IF HE WANTS TO MODIFY HIS REPORT BEFORE IT IS
FILED, I'LL PERMIT IT. BUT FOR MY PURPOSES I AM
RELYING UPON THE BODY OF THE REPORT DESCRIBING THE
NATURE OF USE OF EITHER ALCOHOL OR MARIJUANA --
WHICHEVER REPORT I'M LOOKING AT -- AND NOT THE WAY
THE PROBATION OFFICER CHARACTERIZES THAT.

SO AT THIS POINT I'M GOING TO LEAVE
THESE AS THEY ARE. IF THE PROBATION OFFICER HAS
REASON TO REQUEST THAT HE BE PERMITTED TO MODIFY HIS
REPORT, THEN I'LL CERTAINLY CONSIDER THAT.

LET'S GO ON TO THE NEXT MATTER. ON PAGE
4, ITEM EIGHT.

MS. ABRAMSON: PAGE 14, YOUR HONOR.

THE COURT: NO, ON YOUR PAGE 4, PAGE 14 OF
THE PROBATION REPORT, DEALING WITH THE
CHARACTERIZATION OF THE CRIME SCENE AND DETECTIVE
ZOELLER'S DESCRIPTION OF IT.

COUNSEL ARE VERY TECHNICAL IN THEIR
ANALYSIS OF THE WORDS USED. THIS IS NOT A TRIAL
ISSUE AT THIS POINT, JUST A CHARACTERIZATION BY THE
DETECTIVE OF HOW HE VIEWED THE CRIME SCENE. HE'S
ENTITLED TO GIVE HIS IMPRESSION. HE WAS THERE AND
THAT'S ALL THIS REPRESENTS.

MS. ABRAMSON: WELL, YOUR HONOR, IF I COULD
BE HEARD ON THAT ISSUE.

IT'S TRUE, IT'S NOT A TRIAL ISSUE IN THE
TRIAL. THE JURY GOT TO HEAR ALL POSSIBLE
INTERPRETATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE, AND MUCH MORE
SPECIFIC DESCRIPTIONS, AND CAN FORM THEIR OWN
OPINION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT A CHARACTERIZATION SUCH
AS THIS IS ACCURATE. BUT THIS IS THE ONLY
RECITATION OF THE FACTS THAT THE C.D.C. WILL EVER
SEE. THE PROBATION REPORT BECOMES THE FUNDAMENTAL
FACT DOCUMENT.

THE COURT: RIGHT. THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING
THROUGH THIS AREA.

MS. ABRAMSON: EXACTLY. TO CALL SOMETHING
BODY PARTS CREATES A VISUAL IMAGE THAT IS VERY
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WAS ACTUALLY AT THE SCENE, AND
THEY WILL NOT HAVE THE PHOTOGRAPHS.

I WOULD BE SATISFIED IF THIS IS SIMPLY
REDUCED TO BLOOD AND TISSUE, WHICH IS WHAT IT WAS.
BODY PARTS SOUNDS LIKE HANDS AND EARS AND NOSES, AND
HAS A MUCH MORE HIDEOUS CONNOTATION, WHICH DOESN'T
HAPPEN TO FIT WHAT WE KNOW IS THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
JUST BY LOOKING AT THE PHOTOS.

THE COURT: OKAY. DID THE PEOPLE WISH TO BE
HEARD ON THAT?

MR. CONN: NO, YOUR HONOR.

THE COURT: OKAY. INSTEAD OF BODY PARTS,
YOU'RE ASKING THAT IT SAY TISSUE AND --

MS. ABRAMSON: BLOOD. TO BE ACCURATE.

THE COURT: OKAY. WHICH LINE IS IT?

MS. ABRAMSON: THAT'S LINE 11 ON --

THE COURT: LINE 15 ON THE LYLE MENENDEZ
REPORT.

MS. ABRAMSON: YES. ON THE ERIK MENENDEZ
REPORT IT'S LINE 11 THROUGH 12.

THE COURT: "BODY TISSUE AND BLOOD," INSTEAD
OF "PARTS."

OKAY. THAT'S BEEN AMENDED.

THE NEXT AREA OF OBJECTION IS REFERENCE
TO DR. OZIEL AND THREATS. THIS IS PAGE 14, LINE 12
THROUGH 14.

AS TO THE LYLE MENENDEZ REPORT, THIS IS
ON PAGE 14, LINES 15 THROUGH 17.

WHAT IS THE PEOPLE'S POSITION ON THIS?

IT SEEMS TO ME THAT DR. OZIEL DID
TESTIFY THAT THERE WERE THREATS BY OR STATEMENTS
MADE BY LYLE MENENDEZ WHICH HE INTERPRETED AS
THREATS, AND THAT WAS ON OCTOBER 31ST. AND THEN ON
NOVEMBER THE 2ND HE TESTIFIED THAT HE HAD A
CONVERSATION WITH THE DEFENDANTS IN WHICH THEY TOLD
HIM OF THEIR CONVERSATION WHILE THEY WERE OUTSIDE BY
THE CAR, WHICH THEY TALKED ABOUT, OR LYLE MENENDEZ
DISCUSSED WHETHER THEY SHOULD KILL OZIEL. AND THEY
LAUGHED ABOUT IT AND INFORMED OZIEL OF THAT.

THAT'S MY RECOLLECTION OF THE TESTIMONY.

MS. ABRAMSON: EXACTLY RIGHT. AND YOU CAN'T
CHARACTERIZE THEIR TELLING HIM THEY HAD A
CONVERSATION LIKE THAT AND DECIDED NOT TO, BUT
INSTEAD CAME TO SEE HIM, AS A THREAT, ESPECIALLY THE
WAY THIS IS WRITTEN.

MOREOVER, THE SECOND CLAUSE: HE NEVER
TESTIFIED THAT THEY EVER SAID ANYTHING TO HIM THAT
THEY WOULD KILL HIM IF HE TALKED OR SAID ANYTHING.
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF THAT WHATSOEVER.

THE COURT: WHAT IS THE PEOPLE'S POSITION?

MR. CONN: WE WOULD ASK THAT THE SENTENCE
READ THAT DR. OZIEL TESTIFIED THAT THREATENING
REMARKS WERE MADE TO HIM BY THE DEFENDANTS.

MS. ABRAMSON: WE'LL ACCEPT THAT, YOUR HONOR,
IF THE REST IS STRICKEN.

THE COURT: OKAY. I'VE MODIFIED IT TO STATE
JUST THAT: "DR. OZIEL TESTIFIED THAT THREATENING
REMARKS WERE MADE BY THE DEFENDANTS."  AND I'LL
DELETE THIS OTHER REFERENCE.

OKAY. AND THE NEXT OBJECTION BY THE
DEFENSE APPEARS ON PAGE 14.

MS. ABRAMSON: IT'S THE NEXT SENTENCE.

THE COURT: REGARDING DETECTIVE ZOELLER'S
BELIEF AS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS SHOULD BE
CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING THE DEFENDANTS TOGETHER IN
PRISON.

THAT'S DETECTIVE ZOELLER'S BELIEF AND
THAT'S CONTAINED IN THE REPORT.

WHAT IS THE OBJECTION OF THE DEFENSE TO
THAT? HE'S ENTITLED TO HAVE HIS BELIEF AND EXPRESS
IT IN THE REPORT.

MS. ABRAMSON: HE'S ENTITLED TO HAVE HIS
BELIEF, BUT THIS PARTICULAR BELIEF HAS NO FACTUAL
BASIS FOR HIM. IT'S NOT HIS STATING: I BELIEVE
THAT IF THEY'RE INCARCERATED TOGETHER THUS AND SUCH
WILL HAPPEN. HE'S SAYING HE BELIEVES WHAT SOMEBODY
ELSE SHOULD THINK, AND THAT SOMEBODY ELSE IS AN
ENORMOUS INSTITUTION, THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS,
AND THAT THEY SHOULD BE CONCERNED.

NOT ONLY DOES HE NOT STATE ANY FACTS TO
SUPPORT THAT, BUT OBVIOUSLY THEY'VE BEEN IN JAIL FOR
SIX YEARS AND THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE CONCERNED. IT'S JUST A SPECIOUS SUGGESTION
WITHOUT ANY REAL OPINION OR ANY FACTUAL BASIS, TO
CAUSE THEM HARM BASICALLY.

AND ON THAT BASIS WE ASK IT BE DELETED
BECAUSE HE HAS NO SUPPORT FOR THIS BELIEF.

THE COURT: ALL RIGHT. I FIND THAT THIS IS
NO DIFFERENT THAN OTHER REFERENCES FROM OTHER
INDIVIDUALS AS TO THEIR BELIEFS AND FEELINGS. HE IS
ENTITLED TO HAVE HIS EXPRESSED AND INCORPORATED IN
THE REPORT. SO THE REQUEST TO STRIKE THAT IS
DENIED.

THE NEXT OBJECTION IS ON PAGE 23. IS
THAT ON BOTH REPORTS, THE SAME PAGE?

MS. ABRAMSON: LET ME SEE IF IT'S THE SAME
PLACE. I WOULD ASK THE COURT TO BE CIRCUMSPECT IN
DESCRIBING THIS AREA.

THE COURT: THIS WHOLE THING HAS BEEN
DISCUSSED IN COURT ON OTHER OCCASIONS AND OFFERS OF
PROOF WERE MADE.

MS. ABRAMSON: NOT THIS. THAT HAD TO DO WITH
A BOOK, NOT THIS PARTICULAR ALLEGATION. THAT'S ONLY
BEEN MADE IN THE SLANDER MEDIA. AND I REALLY THINK
IT INAPPROPRIATE TO DISCUSS IT OPENLY HERE WHEN THE
PARTY INVOLVED HAS NO NOTICE OF THIS, CAN BE
ADVERSELY AFFECTED BECAUSE OF THE LITIGATION
PRIVILEGE, HAS NO RECOURSE IN A CIVIL ACTION.

AND SO I WOULD ASK THAT WE SIMPLY NOT
IDENTIFY THE PERSON NAMED.

MR. GESSLER: ON LYLE MENENDEZ' REPORT IT'S
LINE 26 THROUGH 28, SAME PAGE.

THE COURT: I HAVE THAT. IT'S ON 23 THROUGH
25 ON THE ERIK MENENDEZ REPORT.

WHAT IS THE PEOPLE'S POSITION ON THIS?

MR. CONN: I THINK THIS IS MORE IN THE NATURE
OF AN OPINION. THIS IS A PERSON WHO WAS CLOSE TO
THE DEFENDANTS AND WAS IN TOUCH WITH THEM DURING
THIS TIME PERIOD. HE REACHED HIS OWN CONCLUSIONS
CONCERNING THIS MATTER, AND I THINK THAT ANYONE
READING IT WOULD ALSO TAKE IT SIMPLY AS AN OPINION.

SO I ASK THAT IT REMAIN.

MS. ABRAMSON: WELL, YOUR HONOR, FIRST OF
ALL, I THINK THE BASIS -- ONE OF THE BASES FOR OUR
OBJECTION IS THAT THIS IS JUST MALICIOUS SPECULATION
BY A PERSON WHO HIMSELF HAD A FINANCIAL INTEREST IN
THE PARTICULAR OUTCOME THAT WAS ARRIVED AT IN THIS
CASE. ALTHOUGH HE IS CERTAINLY ENTITLED TO THE
PREVIOUS OPINION, AND THE SUBSEQUENT OPINION WHICH
WE DO NOT OBJECT TO, BECAUSE HE'S ENTITLED TO HIS
OPINION.

HOWEVER, I DON'T BELIEVE HE IS ENTITLED
TO SLANDER SOMEONE WITH UTTERLY NO FACTS TO SUPPORT
THE SLANDER. THE SLANDER IS UTTERLY UNTRUE. I HAVE
INDICATED IN OUR MOTION THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR
THIS TO HAVE HAPPENED THE WAY THE PERSON ALLEGES,
BECAUSE THE INFORMATION WAS OUT BEFORE THE
DEFENDANTS EVER MET THE SLANDERED INDIVIDUAL.

AND I THINK, GIVEN THAT IT IS
UNNECESSARY TO INCLUDE A DEFAMATORY STATEMENT OR
STATEMENTS WHEN THE OPINION OF THE PARTY ADDRESSING
THE PROBATION OFFICER CONCERNING TRUTH OR FALSITY IS
CLEARLY STATED, AND WE'RE NOT OBJECTING TO IT
BECAUSE HE IS ENTITLED TO HIS PERSONAL OPINION.

HE'S NOT ENTITLED, HOWEVER, TO USE THIS
COURT AS A FREEWAY TO DEFAME SOMEONE.

THE COURT: WELL, MY ONLY CONCERN IS THAT
THERE IS NO FOUNDATION IN WHAT IS PROVIDED TO ME FOR
HIS OPINION. CERTAINLY, THAT IS HIS OPINION, IF
HE'S STATED IT AS SUCH. BUT THAT DOESN'T
NECESSARILY MEAN THAT IT SHOULD BE INCORPORATED IN
THE REPORT IF THERE'S NO FOUNDATION FOR IT
ESTABLISHED FOR ME TO EVALUATE. I WOULDN'T BE IN A
POSITION TO CONSIDER THIS INFORMATION FOR ANY
PURPOSE IN IMPOSING SENTENCE BECAUSE THERE IS NO
BASIS FOR ITS FOUNDATION ESTABLISHED IN THE REPORT.

THEREFORE, I'M GOING TO JUST REMOVE THAT
FROM THE REPORT JUST ON THE GROUNDS THERE IS NO
FOUNDATION SET FORTH IN THE REPORT FOR IT, AND ONLY
FOR THAT REASON; NOT FOR THESE OTHER REASONS ARGUED
BY COUNSEL.

SO I'M GOING TO REMOVE THAT REFERENCE ON
PAGE 23 OF THE LYLE MENENDEZ REPORT, STARTING ON
LINE 26, WHICH SAYS "IT DID," AND STOPPING ON LINE
28 WITH THE WORD "THIS."

THERE'S NO BASIS FOR ME TO DETERMINE
THAT MR. ANDERSEN HAD SOME INFORMATION AND HOW HE
HAD THIS INFORMATION AND THE RELIABILITY OF IT.
THEREFORE, THAT WILL BE REMOVED.

MS. ABRAMSON: THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

ON THE ERIK MENENDEZ REPORT IT'S LINES
23 THROUGH 25.

THE COURT: AND SIMILARLY, THAT WOULD BE
REMOVED.

MS. ABRAMSON: THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

THE COURT: OKAY. PAGE 25. I'VE BEEN GOING
THROUGH THE ERIK MENENDEZ REPORT WITH THE
UNDERSTANDING THAT THINGS ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME
IN BOTH REPORTS, UNLESS COUNSEL IDENTIFIES SOMETHING
OTHERWISE.

LINE 23. THE OPINION OF THE PROBATION
OFFICER: "HE IS NOW FACING LIFE IN PRISON, AND
RIGHTLY SO."

THE DEFENSE OBJECTS TO THE PHRASE "AND
RIGHTLY SO." THAT IS THE OPINION OF THE PROBATION
OFFICER AND IS PART OF WHY REPORTS ARE PREPARED, TO
GET THE OPINION OF THE OFFICER; AND, THEREFORE, THAT
OPINION WILL STAY IN THE REPORT AS TO BOTH REPORTS.

I THINK WE'VE COVERED EVERYTHING HERE,
UNLESS THERE WAS SOMETHING SPECIFIC TO LYLE
MENENDEZ.

MR. GESSLER: THERE IS, YOUR HONOR, ON PAGE
24, CONCERNING BRIAN ANDERSEN. THERE ARE SOME
SEPARATE THINGS, PREDOMINANTLY LINES 8 AND 9.

THE COURT: OKAY.

MR. GESSLER: CONCERNING HIS USE OF THE TERM
"SOCIOPATHIC MENTALITY," WHICH IS A DIAGNOSIS THAT
CAN ONLY BE MADE BY A PROFESSIONAL IN MENTAL
HEALTH. AND I DON'T THINK THAT TERM SHOULD BE
LOOSELY THROWN AROUND AS AN OPINION BY A LAY
PERSON. THERE'S NO BASIS FOR HIM TO COME UP WITH
THAT.

THE COURT: OKAY. DID YOU WISH TO BE HEARD,
MR. CONN?

MR. CONN: NO, YOUR HONOR.

THE COURT: ALL RIGHT. I'LL REMOVE THAT
REFERENCE. AFTER THE WORDS "AT ALL," THE REST OF
THAT SENTENCE WILL BE REMOVED.

MR. GESSLER: AGAIN, THE WORD IS USED,
"SOCIOPATHIC MENTALITY," AT THE END OF LINE 11, THE
FIRST WORD OF LINE 12. I WOULD ASK THAT ALSO --
WHERE IT SAYS "DOES NOT SHARE THE SAME SOCIOPATHIC
MENTALITY," THAT THAT REFERENCE BE REMOVED.

THE COURT: I'LL REMOVE SOCIOPATHIC AS A
CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS WITHOUT FOUNDATION AS FAR AS THE
PERSONAL OPINION OF MR. ANDERSEN.

ALL RIGHT. ANYTHING ELSE AS TO LYLE
MENENDEZ?

MR. GESSLER: WE WOULD OBJECT TO THE FACT,
AGAIN, OF HIS OPINION AS TO WHETHER LYLE WOULD BE A
PROBLEM IN THE PENAL SYSTEM AS HAVING NO FOUNDATION
WHATSOEVER.

THE COURT: OKAY.

MR. GESSLER: THERE'S LINES -- END OF LINE 9
AND LINE 10.

THE COURT: I THINK THAT'S WITHIN THE REALM
OF PERSONAL OPINION, AND I'LL PERMIT THAT TO STAND,
SINCE HE HAD A SUBSTANTIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
DEFENDANT. THAT'S CERTAINLY HIS OPINION.

MR. GESSLER: I THINK THAT TAKES CARE OF OUR
OBJECTIONS, YOUR HONOR.

THE COURT: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THEN OTHER
THAN WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED IN THE REPORTS OF THE
PROBATION OFFICER, TO MODIFY THOSE REPORTS, IS THERE
ANY LEGAL CAUSE WHY SENTENCE SHOULD NOT BE
PRONOUNCED?

MR. GESSLER: NO, YOUR HONOR.

MS. ABRAMSON: NO, YOUR HONOR.

THE COURT: OKAY. THEN WE'LL PROCEED WITH
SENTENCING.

DID THE DEFENSE WISH TO BE HEARD
FURTHER?

I'VE READ THE REPORTS OF EACH
DEFENDANT. I'VE READ AND CONSIDERED EACH REPORT.
I'VE READ AND CONSIDERED THE ATTACHMENTS.

MS. ABRAMSON: I'M SORRY?

MS. ABRAMSON:  ONE OTHER MOTION IS PENDING, YOUR
HONOR, AND THAT IS NOT RELEASING A PROBATION REPORT TO
THE MEDIA UNTIL IT HAS BEEN MODIFIED.

THE COURT: WELL, I HAVE MODIFIED IT, AND IN ITS
MODIFIED VERSION IT WILL BE FILED WITH THE COURT AS AN
OFFICIAL DOCUMENT AND SUBJECT TO RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC
BY ENTERING OF THE JUDGMENT.

MS. ABRAMSON: MAY WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK
AT THE COURT'S MODIFICATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT
PARTICULAR PART THAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING TO DO
WITH DEFAMATION IS SUFFICIENTLY DELETED SO THAT IT
CANNOT BE READ?

THE COURT: WHAT I WILL DO IS HAVE THE CLERK MAKE
COPIES OF WHAT I'VE DONE AND MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO
COUNSEL.

MS. ABRAMSON: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, YOUR HONOR.

WE WOULD LIKE A BRIEF BREAK, YOUR HONOR, SO
WE CAN TALK TO THE PROBATION OFFICER.

THE COURT: WELL, ON THAT ONE ISSUE, AS I
INDICATED, I AM NOT CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT THE
PROBATION OFFICER CHECKED THAT PARTICULAR BOX FOR ANY
PURPOSE IN IMPOSING SENTENCE. THE INFORMATION ABOUT
EITHER ALCOHOL OR MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION THAT IS
CONTAINED IN THE REPORT OF EACH DEFENDANT IS WHAT I
CONSIDER THE FACT THE PROBATION OFFICER CHOSE TO PUNCH
THE BOX OR CHECK THE BOX, SO I WILL CERTAINLY ALLOW YOU
TO TALK TO THE PROBATION OFFICER. IF HE WANTS TO DELETE
THAT, IT WILL BE DELETED BEFORE IT IS ACTUALLY FILED,
AND THE PROBATION OFFICER CAN INFORM THE CLERK THAT HE
WANTS TO MAKE THAT MODIFICATION, IF HE DOES.

ALL RIGHT. THEN AS I INDICATED, WE ARE NOW
READY TO PROCEED WITH SENTENCING.

ANYTHING FURTHER FROM THE DEFENSE?

MR. GESSLER: NO, YOUR HONOR.

MS. ABRAMSON: NO, YOUR HONOR.

THE COURT: OKAY.

AS TO THE DEFENDANT, ERIK GALEN MENENDEZ,
THEN AS TO COUNT I, MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE WITH
SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES PURSUANT TO SECTION 190.2(A)15 AND
190.2(A)3 HAVING BEEN FOUND TRUE, THE DEFENDANT IS
SENTENCED TO STATE PRISON FOR THE TERM OF LIFE WITHOUT
THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE.

AS TO COUNT 2, A VIOLATION OF SECTION 187
OF THE PENAL CODE, FIRST-DEGREE MURDER, THE SAME SPECIAL
CIRCUMSTANCES, THE DEFENDANT IS SENTENCED TO STATE
PRISON, LIFE IN PRISON WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF
PAROLE.

THAT SENTENCE IS CONSECUTIVE TO THE
SENTENCE IN COUNT 1. THESE ARE SEPARATE ACTS OF
VIOLENCE, SEPARATELY CONSIDERED BY THE DEFENDANT AND
ARRIVED AT AFTER DELIBERATION OF PREMEDITATION, AND THE
COURT FEELS THAT BECAUSE OF THE SEPARATE DECISIONS MADE
BY THE DEFENDANTS AS TO THE MURDER OF EACH VICTIM AND
THE SEPARATE VIOLENCE INVOLVED IN THE KILLING OF EACH
VICTIM, THAT THESE ARE APPROPRIATELY CONSECUTIVE
SENTENCES.

AS TO COUNT 3, CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MURDER,
THE DEFENDANT IS SENTENCED TO THE TERM OF 25 YEARS TO
LIFE IN THE STATE PRISON. THAT SENTENCE IS STAYED
PURSUANT TO SECTION 654 OF THE PENAL CODE; THAT STAY TO
BECOME PERMANENT UPON COMPLETION OF THE SENTENCE IN
COUNTS 1 AND 2.

MS. ABRAMSON: YOUR HONOR, FOR THE RECORD I WANT
IT NOTED THAT WE OBJECT TO THE CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES,
SINCE THIS IS ONE ACT, ONE ACT OF FIRING A WEAPON.

BUT I WANT TO PUT THAT OBJECTION ON THE
RECORD, BECAUSE I HAD NOT PLANNED TO APPEAL FROM THE
SENTENCE, AND NOW I MUST APPEAL FROM THE SENTENCE AS
WELL.

THE COURT: IT'S QUITE CLEAR FROM THE EVIDENCE
THAT THE DEFENDANTS SEPARATELY CONSIDERED KILLING EACH
PARENT, MADE A DECISION SEPARATELY AS TO KILLING THEM.
THIS WAS A DECISION MADE OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL DAYS.
THE EVIDENCE IS QUITE CLEAR THAT THEY CONSIDERED KILLING
ONE PARENT, KILLING BOTH PARENTS, AND ULTIMATELY MADE A
DECISION TO KILL THEM BOTH, AND THEREAFTER FOLLOWED
THROUGH ON THAT AGREEMENT AS PART OF THEIR CONSPIRACY.

AS FAR AS CREDITS, THE DEFENDANT IS
ENTITLED TO 2306 DAYS TIME SERVED. THAT'S ACTUAL TIME
SERVED. HE IS ALSO ENTITLED TO ADDITIONAL CREDITS, IN
ADDITION TO THAT, FOR A TOTAL OF 3458 DAYS AS TO ERIK
MENENDEZ.

AS TO LYLE MENENDEZ, SIMILARLY AS TO
COUNT 1, HE IS SENTENCED TO STATE PRISON FOR
FIRST-DEGREE MURDER, SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES PURSUANT TO
SECTION 190.2(A)15 AND 190.2(A)3, SENTENCED TO STATE
PRISON FOR LIFE WITHOUT POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE.

COUNT 2, LIKEWISE SENTENCED TO STATE PRISON
PURSUANT TO SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES HAVING BEEN FOUND TRUE
OF THE FIRST-DEGREE MURDER, LIFE IN PRISON WITHOUT
POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE.

THE COURT IMPOSES CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES.
THE COURT FINDS THAT THESE ARE SEPARATE ACTS OF
VIOLENCE, SEPARATELY COMMITTED BY THE DEFENDANTS AFTER
CAREFULLY PLANNING AND CONTEMPLATING THE ACTS OF KILLING
ONE OR BOTH PARENTS, AND ULTIMATELY DECIDING TO KILL
BOTH. THEREFORE, THE COURT FINDS IT'S APPROPRIATE TO
IMPOSE CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES AS TO COUNTS 1 AND 2.

AS TO COUNT 3, CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MURDER,
THE COURT IMPOSES A SENTENCE OF 25 YEARS TO LIFE. THAT
SENTENCE IS STAYED PURSUANT TO SECTION 654 OF THE PENAL
CODE, THAT STAY TO BECOME PERMANENT UPON COMPLETION OF
THE SENTENCE IN COUNTS 1 AND 2. AS TO LYLE MENENDEZ, HE
IS ENTITLED TO CREDITS OF 2038 DAYS.

MS. ABRAMSON: EXCUSE ME, YOUR HONOR. I DON'T
WANT TO CONFUSE THINGS, BUT ACCORDING TO THE PROBATION
REPORT, ERIK MENENDEZ' DAYS WERE 2375.

THE COURT: WELL, THE CLERK HAS CALCULATED THE
DAYS, AND THE DAYS FOR ERIK MENENDEZ -- PERHAPS I
MISSTATED IT -- THE CALCULATION RESULTED IN 2306, AND
FOR LYLE MENENDEZ 2308, AND HE IS ENTITLED TO 1154 DAYS
ADDITIONAL CREDITS, TOTALING 3462 DAYS.

AS TO LYLE MENENDEZ --

MS. ABRAMSON: COULD THE COURT INDICATE THE
NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL DAYS GRANTED TO ERIK MENENDEZ FOR
GOOD TIME/WORK TIME?

THE COURT: OKAY, I'LL DO IT AGAIN.

MR. LEVIN: I THINK YOU SAID 1152.

THE COURT: THE RULE IS DIVIDE BY FOUR, ROUND
DOWN TO THE LOWER NUMBER, SO THAT'S 576, AND THEN DOUBLE
THAT IS 1152 DAYS.

THE COURT: SO 1152, PLUS 2306.

MS. ABRAMSON: THANK YOU.

THE COURT: THAT'S 3458.

EACH DEFENDANT HAS A RIGHT TO APPEAL THE
JUDGMENT AND SENTENCE OF THIS COURT. IF THEY CHOOSE TO
DO SO, THEY MUST FILE A NOTICE OF APPEAL WITHIN 60 DAYS
IN THIS COURT, SETTING FORTH IN WRITING THE REASONS FOR
THEIR APPEAL, SPECIFYING WHAT IT IS THEY ARE APPEALING,
EITHER THE SENTENCE OR THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT, OR
WHATEVER ISSUES THEY WISH TO ADDRESS IN THEIR APPEAL.

IF THEY CANNOT AFFORD COUNSEL, THE
APPELLATE COURT WILL APPOINT COUNSEL TO REPRESENT THEM
DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE APPEAL.

THEY SHOULD KEEP THE APPELLATE COURT
INFORMED OF THEIR WHEREABOUTS THROUGHOUT THE PENDENCY OF
THEIR APPEAL SO THE APPELLATE COURT CAN COMMUNICATE WITH
THEM DURING THE PENDENCY OF THIS APPEAL.

DO YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL THE
JUDGMENT AND SENTENCE OF THIS COURT, LYLE MENENDEZ?

DEFENDANT LYLE MENENDEZ: I DO, YOUR HONOR.

THE COURT: AND DO YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHT TO
APPEAL THE JUDGMENT AND SENTENCE OF THIS COURT, ERIK
MENENDEZ?

DEFENDANT ERIK MENENDEZ: YES, YOUR HONOR.

THE COURT: OKAY.

AS TO THE ISSUE OF THE ABILITY -- THE
PRESENT ABILITY OF THE DEFENDANTS TO REIMBURSE THE
COUNTY FOR THE SERVICES OF THEIR REPRESENTATION, THE
COURT HAS RECEIVED A REPORT FROM THE COST RECOVERY UNIT
OF THE SUPERIOR COURT INDICATING THAT AT THIS POINT
THERE IS INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION FOR THIS COURT TO MAKE
A DETERMINATION THAT THE DEFENDANTS HAVE THE PRESENT
ABILITY TO PAY FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF THE COST OF THEIR
REPRESENTATION.

HOWEVER, THE COURT WILL RETAIN
JURISDICTION, AS IT IS ENTITLED TO, UNDER SECTION
987.8(B) FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS TO REVIEW THE MATTER
AND SCHEDULE A FURTHER HEARING, IF THE COURT FEELS
APPROPRIATE, TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER OR NOT THE DEFENDANTS
HAVE THE PRESENT ABILITY TO REIMBURSE THE COUNTY FOR ANY
OR PART OF THE REPRESENTATION PROVIDED BY
COURT-APPOINTED COUNSEL.

ALL RIGHT. THE DEFENDANTS ARE EACH
REMANDED TO THE CUSTODY OF THE SHERIFF, TO BE
TRANSPORTED BY THE SHERIFF FORTHWITH TO STATE PRISON TO
BEGIN COMMENCEMENT OF THEIR STATE PRISON SENTENCES.

THAT COMPLETES THIS TRIAL.

(AT 10:20 A.M. PROCEEDINGS WERE ADJOURNED.)

Just a day after the penalty phase of the Menendez brothers trial teetered on the brink of disaster, both sides rested their cases and closing arguments were set to begin.</P>

The court addressed in camera matters relating to the testimony of Dr. William Vicary.</P>

<P><B>Trial Transcript: April 5</B> [<I><A HREF="apr05.zip">Download Compressed File</A></I>]<BR>
Defense lawyer Leslie  Abramson invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege not to incriminate herself and refused to answer Judge Stanley Weisberg's questions about possible misconduct.On her lawyer's advice, Abramson refused to answer two questions  about a set of notes, which she allegedly ordered a psychiatrist  to alter and then turned over to prosecutors. Judge Weisberg asked her which copy of the notes she had turned over to prosecutors in 1993 -- the original or the doctored version -- and why there were redactions in the notes. Abramson responded to both questions, "I assert the privilege."</P>

<P><B>Trial Transcript: April 4</B> [<I><A HREF="apr04.zip">Download Compressed File</A></I>]<BR>
The illustrious defense lawyer Leslie Abramson may have seriously damaged her credibility with the jurors who must decide between life and death for her client, Erik Menendez. In a stunning courtroom moment, the psychiatrist who has treated Erik Menendez since his arrest admitted that he doctored his notes of those sessions at the direction of Abramson.  conceded under cross-examination that he omitted from his notes an entire section containing possibly incriminating statements by Erik Menendez.</P>

Friends and relatives testified for the defense about the treatment of the Menendez brothers. Eric's high school sweatheart cried often while describing him as a most kind and generous boyfriend.  And Lyle's soccer coach told of a father who treated Lyle more like a racehorse than a son.</P>

Defense attorney Leslie Abramson urged the jury to acquit Erik Menendez in the slaying of his mother and find him guilty only of manslaughter in the death of his father. She told jurors that Erik was in a state of terror on the night of the shootings and that terror made it impossible to form the mental state for murder.</P>

A 27-year-old black female juror was excused for being inattentive during portions of the trial. Later, the defense presented witnesses to contradict the testimony of Craig Cignarelli, Erik Menendez's former best friend.</P>

<P><B>Trial Transcript: February 13</B> [<I><A HREF="feb13.zip">Download Compressed File</A></I>]<BR>
The defense called Teresita Baralto, the Menendez brothers' aunt, who testified that just days after the killings, the family replaced the furniture in the den where Kitty and Jose Menendez were killed. This defense is using this testimony to rebut prosecution witness Craig Cignarelli, who claims that Erik gave him a tour of the room, providing details of the shooting.</P>

<P><B>Trial Transcript: February 7</B> [<I><A HREF="feb07.zip">Download Compressed File</A></I>]<BR>
The jury didn't hear testimony because Erik Menendez was sick. In the morning, lawyers argued over the scope of Dr. Park Dietz' testimony. Dr. Dietz, a prosecution witness, has refused to diagnose Menendez with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or any other condition that would have impaired his ability to make a decision the night he opened fire on his parents.</P>

Lyle Menendez's former fiancee contradicted Erik's earlier testimony that he did not know his brother wore a wig. This testimony could call into question a major part of the defense case: that a week-long family confrontation between Jose and Kitty Menendez and their sons led to the fatal shootings on August 20, 1989.</P>

Lawyers argued over the possible testimony of a representative from the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Prosecutors said the representative will testify that Erik Menendez never applied for a duplicate license. Menendez said that he lost his license and that is why he used Donovan Goodreau's to buy the shotguns he and his brother used to kill their parents.</P>

<H3>The Transcripts</H3>

<P><B>Trial Transcript: January 31</B> [<I><A HREF="jan31.zip">Download Compressed File</A></I>]<BR>
The defense was dealt two painful blows before resting its cas-in-chief. Judge Stanley Weisberg ruled defense attorneys could not introduce the testimony of Dr. William Vicary, a psychiatrist who has been treating Erik Menendez since 1990. The judge ruled the testimony only would be relevant as sur-rebuttal testimony, to rebut the testimony of the state's psychiatrist. The judge then ruled the defense could not introduce the videotaped testimony of Lyle Menendez's testimony from the first trial.</P>

<P><B>Trial Transcript: January 30</B> [<I><A HREF="jan30.zip">Download Compressed File</A></I>]<BR>
After presenting 25 witnesses and more than 400 exhibits, the defense indicated that it is about to rest its case. Noticeably absent from the defense case-in-chief was Lyle Menendez.</P>

<P><B>Trial Transcript: January 29</B> [<I><A HREF="jan29.zip">Download Compressed File</A></I>]<BR>
The defense presented testimony to try and refute prosecution claims that Lyle and Erik Menendez killed their parents in order to get the family fortune. Marta Cano, Jose Menendez's older sister, testified that shortly after the August 1989 killings, the brothers told her that they believed they had been written out of their father's will a year earlier.</P>

<P><B>Trial Transcript: January 26</B> [<I><A HREF="jan26.zip">Download Compressed File</A></I>]<BR>
Judge Stanley Weisberg cut six witnesses from the defense list, ruling that they are irrelevant in the current trial, although they did testify at the first trial. The witnesses include Lyle and Erik's teachers, friends and a coach, and all would have testified about the parents' alleged psychological mistreatment of the brothers. The judge ruled that the issue of psychological mistreatment is irrelevant in the current trial.</P>

A key expert defense witness completed his testimony after seven days on the witness stand. Dr. Wilson, director of the Center for Stress & Trauma in Cleveland, testified that Erik suffers from the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of prolonged sexual and physical abuse. He also said Erik was suffering from the disorder when he and his brother Lyle shot their parents on August 20, 1989.</P>

Prosecutor David Conn questioned defense witness Dr. John Wilson about the results of psychological diagnostic tests given to Erik Menendez. When Conn pointed out that it would be easy to lie in answering the test questions, Dr. Wilson responded that he had to rely on Erik's word as the basis of most of the test results.</P>

Defense attorneys demanded a mistrial after the prosecution began its cross-examination of a key defense expert witness.

The defense presented expert testimony to explain why Erik Menendez never tried to escape the alleged abuse at the hands of his father. Dr. John Wilson testified about what he called the common misconceptions about victims of child abuse. Two of the misconceptions, he said, are that abuse victims can just pack up and leave their abusers and that abuse victims reveal their situations.</P>

The defense offered additional testimony about possible abuse in the Menendez home. The witnesses included Kathy Simonton, a cousin of the brothers, who testified how Jose Menendez treated his sons when he taught them how to swim. She said he dunked their heads under water until they kicked, flailed, choked and cried. Additional testimony came from Dr. Kerry English who reviewed Erik's childhood medical records. He said Erik suffered an injury to the back of his throat that could be consistent with forced oral sex.</P>

A cousin of the Menendez brothers testified that Jose Menendez spent hours with Erik behind the closed door of his bedroom -- a claim the defense says is evidence of sexual molestation. The witness, Diane Vander Molen, testified that Jose Menendez terrified his son by "roaring at him," and that he was "fierce in his anger." Vander Molen broke down in tears as she told jurors how Kitty Menendez would scream at Erik for making mistakes on his homework.</P>

Brian Alan Anderson, the Menendez brothers' cousin, testified about summer visits he made to the Menendez home, offering evidence of possible sexual and physical abuse to corroborate Erik Menendez's story. He said Jose Menendez would snap a belt on the coffee table as Kitty Menendez rattled off reasons to discipline the children. From a nearby room, Anderson said he heard Jose whip Erik and Lyle. He said he later saw scars on the boys' legs and buttocks. Anderson also recalled Jose showering with Erik and Lyle when the brothers were teenagers. The defense claims this is evidence of sexual molestation. On cross-examination, Anderson to admitted that shortly before Lyle's arrest,  Lyle gave him a $8,500 loan. Prosecutor David Conn suggested that it was a payoff. Anderson said he told Lyle that he couldn't pay the loan back because his daughter is in the hospital, dying from E. Coli, an infectious disease.</P>

The lawyer defending Lyle Menendez indicated a significant change in legal strategy. Attorney Charles Gessler told the court that he plans to argue Lyle killed in the heat of passion -- that fear and anger overwhelmed him on August 20, 1989, when he and his brother shot their parents. During the first trial, Lyle said he killed out of the honest but mistaken belief that his parents were going to kill him.</P>

The defense case entered a new phase as a psychologist testified that Erik Menendez suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder at the time he killed his parents. Dr. John P. Wilson told jurors that the cause of Erik's disorder was the repeated acts of sexual molestation and physical and psychological abuse. He said Erik exhibited classic disorder symptoms such as recurring nightmares and amnesia.</P>

Erik Menendez stepped down from the witness stand after 15 days of testimony. The defense tried to introduce a letter found in Menendez's cell about three months after the brothers' arrest. In the letter, Lyle Menendez writes about not wanting to reveal the family secret of sexual abuse as a defense to the crimes. He says he would rather die or escape. The letter is proof the brothers did not concoct the story, defense lawyers said. But Judge Stanley Weisberg did not allow it to be entered into evidence, ruling it hearsay.</P>

After eight days, Prosecutor David Conn concluded his cross-examination of Erik Menendez, spending most of the session hammering away at Erik's tape recorded therapy sessions with Dr. Jerome Oziel. In those sessions, Erik admits that he and his brother killed their parents. But if he trusted the doctor so much, why did he fail to mention the lifetime of abuse? Conn asked. Erik said he did not trust Dr. Oziel. Rather, Oziel was blackmailing the Menendez brothers to get his hands on the family fortune. </P>

With one of the jurors called out of court because of a family emergency, no witnesses testified. Lawyers argued before Judge Stanley Weisberg about whether the defense can introduce videotapes of Lyle Menendez's testimony from the first trial.</P>

<P><B>Trial Transcript: January 4</B> [<I><A HREF="jan04.zip">Download Compressed File</A></I>]<BR>
Did Erik Menendez confide in his former friend Craig Cignarelli about the night of the killings? According to Cignarelli's testimony from the first trial, the brothers entered the family den while their parents sat on the couch. Lyle Menendez shot his father and told his brother to "shoot Mom," who stood and started to yell when the fatal shots were fired. Prosecutor David Conn quizzed Erik Menendez about Cignarelli's testimony. Menendez repeatedly denied ever making those statements. The defense contended that Conn followed this line of questioning as a way to put Cignarelli's testimony before the jury without calling Cignarelli as a witness. In the first trial, Cignarelli's credibility was shaken under cross-examination.</P>

<P><B>Trial Transcript: January 3</B> [<I><A HREF="jan03.zip">Download Compressed File</A></I>]<BR>
Prosecutor David Conn grilled Erik Menendez on the minute details of the shooting spree. Menendez said he couldn't remember much more than the boom and red flare coming from his shotgun as he fired at his parents. Under Conn's pressure, Menendez said he did not actually see his father coming at him, but the fear that his life was in danger made him believe it.</P>

The defense indicated that it wants to play a videotape of Lyle Menendez's testimony from the first trial, a move which would allow Menendez to avoid facing cross-examination. The defense strategy is to have Erik Menendez call Lyle as a witness. Lyle would invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to testify. Because Lyle would be unavailable, Erik's lawyers say they should then be allowed to use Lyle's previously recorded testimony.</P>

In opening arguments, prosecutor David Conn said Erik and Lyle Menendez carefully calculated the shotgun killing of their parents in 1989 and they should be convicted of first degree murder regardless of the motive. Defense lawyer Leslie Abramson said the brothers were sexually abused and acted out of fear. She said they should be convicted of nothing more than manslaughter.</P>

ELEMENTS AND RELEVANT CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE
OFFENSES:

THE DEFENDANTS CONSPIRED TOGETHER AND
MURDERED JOSE ENRIQUE MENENDEZ (AGE 45) AND
MARY LOUISE "KITTY" (ANDERSEN) MENENDEZ (AGE 48),
THEIR PARENTS AT THEIR BEVERLY HILLS HOME.

IN THE SPRING OF 1989, THE DEFENDANT STOLE AN
IDENTIFICATION CARD FROM HIS ROOMMATE AT
COLLEGE. ON AUGUST 18, 1989, THE DEFENDANTS DROVE
TO SAN DIEGO COUNTY WHERE THE CO-DEFENDANT
USED THIS IDENTIFICATION CARD TO PURCHASE TWO
IDENTICAL MOSSBURG 12-GAUGE SHOTGUNS CAPABLE
OF HOLDING FIVE ROUNDS IN ADDITION TO ONE ROUND
IN THE CHAMBER. THEY ALSO LATER PURCHASED SOME
BUCK (.33 CALIBER PELLETS) SHELLS IN ADDITION TO
THE "BIRDSHOT" THEY OBTAINED AT THE TIME OF THE
ORIGINAL GUN PURCHASE.

ON THE NIGHT OF AUGUST 20, 1989, THE DEFENDANTS
LOADED THEIR GUNS WITH ROUNDS OF 4 BUCK EACH. AT
ABOUT 10:00 OR 10:15 P.M., THE DEFENDANTS BURST
INTO THE FAMILY DEN WHERE THE VICTIMS WERE
SITTING ON THE COUCH. ALL TEN ROUNDS WERE FIRED
AT THE VICTIMS AND ALL BUT ONE FOUND THEIR
MARKS. (ONE ROUND WAS A COMPLETE MISS AND WENT
THROUGH A SHUTTER AND WINDOW BEHIND THE
VICTIMS.) BECAUSE VICTIM "KITTY" APPEARED TO BE
STILL MOVING, THE DEFENDANTS THEN WENT TO THE
DEFENDANT'S CAR WHERE THE CO-DEFENDANT
RETRIEVED ONE OR TWO SHELLS  OF BIRDSHOT. HE GAVE
THE SHELL TO THE DEFENDANT WHO RETURNED TO THE
SCENE OF THE CRIME AND SHOT VICTIM "KITTY" IN THE
FACE AT POINT BLANK RANGE. AFTER PICKING UP THE
EMPTY SHELLS, THEY LEFT TO GET RID OF THE GUNS
AND BLOODY CLOTHING AND ATTEMPTED TO ESTABLISH
AN ALIBI BY MEETING WITH A FRIEND. WHEN THEY
WERE UNSUCCESSFUL IN ESTABLISHING CONTACT WITH
THIS PERSON, THEY RETURNED TO THE HOUSE AND
CALLED THE BEVERLY HILLS POLICE DEPARTMENT AT
11:47 P.M. TO REPORT THE MURDERS. AFTER BEING
QUESTIONED BY THE POLICE, THEY RETURNED TO THE
HOUSE AND WERE ABLE TO REMOVE THE WRAPPINGS
AND PAPERS FROM THE GUNS AND AMMUNITION THAT
HAD BEEN LEFT IN THE DEFENDANT'S CAR.

DEFENDANT STATEMENT:
ADDITIONAL RELEVANT PERSONAL HISTORY:

DEFENDANT STATES HE STARTED PLAYING TENNIS
WHEN HE WAS FIVE YEARS OLD. HE PLAYED THROUGH
HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE. HE HAD THE BEST RECORD
IN NEW JERSEY IN HIGH SCHOOL. HE PLAYED PRO
TENNIS SEVERAL TIMES. HE ALSO PLAYED SOCCER AS A
CHILD. HE MADE THE NATIONAL ALL-STAR TEAM AND
PLAYED IN GIANT'S STADIUM DURING HALF TIME OF A
PROFESSIONAL SOCCER GAME.


DEFENDANT'S STATEMENT:

HE WAS MOLESTED BY HIS FATHER AS A CHILD. IT
STOPPED WHEN HE WAS 8 YEARS OLD, BUT HE
CONTINUED TO SEE VIOLENCE UNTIL HE WAS 11 OR 12.
HIS MOTHER WAS ALSO THE VICTIM OF VIOLENCE BY HIS
FATHER, BUT NOTHING WAS EVER REPORTED TO THE
POLICE. HOWEVER, HE HAS NOT BEEN PUNCHED BY
FATHER SINCE HE WAS 16. WHEN HE WAS 13, HE
CONFRONTED FATHER ABOUT THE CHILD ABUSE OF CO-
DEFENDANT ERIK. HE FELT GOOD ABOUT THE
CONFRONTATION AND THOUGHT THE ABUSE HAD
STOPPED. WHEN HE CAME HOME FROM PRINCETON IN
JUNE, 1989, HE LIVED IN THE GUEST HOUSE AND LATER
DISCOVERED THAT HIS PHONE CALLS HAD BEEN TAPED
BY HIS MOTHER. HE CONFRONTED FATHER AGAIN
ABOUT WHAT HE WAS DOING TO ERIK AND FATHER
THREATENED HIM. DEFENDANT FELT FATHER WAS
GOING TO KILL THEM IF THEY TOLD ABOUT THE ABUSE.
FATHER DID NOT HAVE TREMENDOUS MORAL FIBER. HE
WOULD RATHER FIGHT THE CHARGES OF MURDERING
HIS SONS THAN THE CHARGE OF CHILD MOLESTING.

HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS MOTHER WAS A DISASTER.
HE TRIED TO TALK TO HER, BUT SHE SAID ERIK WAS
LYING OR EXAGGERATING. HE THEN REALIZED SHE WAS
NOT GOING TO INTERVENE. HE WANTED TO LEAVE, BUT
ERIK WAS NOT READY EMOTIONALLY TO LEAVE. FATHER
"HAD OUR LIVES UNDER HIS CONTROL... LEAVING WAS A
BIG THING."  DEFENDANT  DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE
WITH ERIK STILL THERE. "I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE   HIM
ALONE." ERIK CAME TO HIM A COUPLE DAYS BEFORE THE
MURDERS AND WAS SUICIDAL. FATHER WAS A
POWERFUL AND PROMINENT MAN AND HE WAS NOT
GOING TO BE RUINED BY HIS OWN SONS. HE WAS
CAPABLE OF TAKING EXTREME STEPS. THE THURSDAY
BEFORE THE MURDERS, THEY DECIDED TO GET SOME
HANDGUNS. HOWEVER, HE WAS SHOCKED WHEN TOLD
THEY WOULD HAVE TO WAIT TWO WEEKS TO GET THE
GUNS. HE DID NOT FEEL THEY COULD WAIT TWO WEEKS.
"WE WERE IN A CRISIS." FATHER FALSELY BELIEVED
DEFENDANT INTENDED TO EXPOSE HIM. THEY PLANNED
TO STAY AT THE HOUSE, AND GUNS WOULD GIVE THEM
SOME PROTECTION AT NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE MOST
VULNERABLE. THEY DROVE TOWARD SAN DIEGO AND
ENDED UP BUYING SHOTGUNS AT A BIG FIVE STORE.
THEY USED THE IDENTIFICATION CARD OF HIS
ROOMMATE AT PRINCETON THAT ERIK WAS USING TO
GET INTO NIGHT CLUBS, TO PURCHASE THE GUNS AND
SHELLS. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO GO SHARK FISHING
ON SATURDAY MORNING (AUGUST 19). HOWEVER,
MOTHER TOLD THEM IT WAS POSTPONED UNTIL THE
AFTERNOON. THEY THOUGHT THIS WAS ODD AND
THOUGHT FATHER MAY BE INTENDING TO USE THEM AS
SHARK BAIT. THERE  WAS A LOT OF TENSION DURING
THE FISHING TRIP. HE TRIED TO TALK TO MOTHER, BUT
SHE SAID, "NO ONE HAD HELPED HER, SO WHY SHOULD
SHE HELP US." BY SUNDAY, "THERE WAS NO MORE
FAMILY." HE WAS WAITING FOR ERIK TO COME HOME SO
THEY COULD GO TO THE MOVIES. BUT MOTHER SAID HE
COULD NOT GO TO THE MOVIES. THIS WAS VERY
UNUSUAL. WHEN ASKED WHY, SHE COULD NOT GIVE A
REASON. HE FELT FATHER WAS KEEPING HIM HOME FOR
SOME REASON. HE GOT INTO ANOTHER ARGUMENT WITH
FATHER. "I FELT SOMETHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN."
HE RAN UPSTAIRS TO TALK TO ERIK; THEY WERE
CONVINCED THEIR PARENTS WERE GOING TO KILL THEM
THAT NIGHT. "WE BASICALLY MADE PANICKED
DECISIONS." DEFENDANT RAN TO THE GUEST HOUSE TO
GET HIS GUN AND THEN TO HIS CAR TO GET THE SHELLS.
"I WAS SO PRIMED FOR A SHOOT-OUT, THIS IS WHAT I
THOUGHT WOULD OCCUR" AND ENTERED THE DEN
FIRING. THE DEN WAS DARK BUT THE TELEVISION WAS
ON. HE FIRED VERY HAPHAZARDLY AND FIRED ALL HIS
AMMUNITION. IT WAS ALL OVER IN ABOUT TEN
SECONDS. THEY RAN OUT AND GOT MORE
SHELLS. DEFENDANT WENT BACK AND SHOT HIS
MOTHER IN THE FACE. "I WAS PANICKED - NOT
THINKING VERY CLEARLY." THEY THEN WAITED,
EXPECTING THE POLICE TO ARRIVE MOMENTARILY.
HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH THEIR NEIGHBORS HEARD THE
GUNSHOTS, NO ONE CALLED THE POLICE. THEY PICKED
UP THE EMPTY SHOTGUN SHELLS AND THEN JUST LEFT.
THEY TRIED TO GET INTO THE MOVIES, BUT IT WAS TOO
LATE. THEY WENT UP TO MULHOLLAND DRIVE AND
"DITCHED" THE GUNS AND BLOODY CLOTHES. THEY
THEN WENT HOME AND CALLED THE POLICE. AT THE
POLICE STATION, ERIK WENT IN FIRST TO TALK TO THE
DETECTIVE. HE WAITED FOR ERIK TO COME OUT TO SEE
WHETHER HE CONFESSED. IF SO, DEFENDANT WOULD
ALSO CONFESS. HOWEVER, ERIK SIGNALED TO HIM THAT
EVERYTHING WAS OKAY. THE DETECTIVE WAS EASY ON
HIM AND LET HIM "OFF THE HOOK." THEY SPENT THE
REST OF THE NIGHT AT HIS TENNIS COACH'S HOUSE IN
BRENTWOOD AND TOOK A TAXI HOME IN THE MORNING.
THE HOUSE AND HIS CAR WERE ALL INSIDE THE POLICE
CRIME SCENE TAPE, BUT THEY GOT INTO THE CAR AND
REMOVED THE GUN WRAPPINGS AND OTHER EVIDENCE.

AT THE TIME OF HIS ARREST, HE WAS LIVING WITH HIS
AUNT IN NEW JERSEY. HE HAD COME TO LQS ANGELES
TO DRIVE HIS CAR BACK EAST. HE HAD BEEN STAYING IN
THE BEVERLY HILLS HOME ABOUT A  WEEK WHEN HE
WAS ARRESTED DRIVING AWAY FROM THE HOUSE.

HE NOW BELIEVES THAT HIS PARENTS WERE NOT GOING
TO KILL THEM - AT LEAST NOT THEN. HE REGRETS WHAT
HE DID, NOT ONLY TO HIS PARENTS, BUT TO HIS
RELATIVES AND THEMSELVES. HE HAS VISITED HIS
PARENTS GRAVES IN NEW JERSEY AND TALKED TO
THEM. "I HAVE MADE PEACE WITH MOM AND DAD." HE NO
LONGER FEELS THEIR ANGER.

AEOUT THREE MONTHS AFTER HIS ARREST, HE WAS
FANTASIZING ABOUT ESCAPING FROM JAIL, AS ALL
INMATES DO. THE SHERIFFS FOUND HIS MUSINGS AND
NOTES AND ACCUSED HIM OF TRYING TO ESCAPE.
HOWEVER, THERE WAS NEVER ANY REAL PLAN
FORMULATED.


INTERESTED PARTIES:

LES ZOELLER, DETECTIVE, EEVERLY HILLS POLICE
DEPARTMENT (310) 285-2145, PROVIDED PART OF THE
INFORMATION FOR THE PRESENT OFFENSE SECTION OF
THIS REPORT. HE ADDED THAT THE DEFENDANTS LIED TO
THEM FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. THE VICTIMS' EODY
TISSUE AND BLOOD WERE ALL OVER THE WALLS AND
CEILINGS. DR. OZIEL TESTIFIED THAT CERTAIN
REMARKS WERE MADE BY THE DEFENDANTS.

HE BELIEVES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS
SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING THE
DEFENDANTS TOGETHER IN PRISON.

ATTACHED ARE NUMEROUS LETTERS FROM RELATIVES,
FRIENDS AND FORMER JURORS OF THE DEFENDANTS.
THEY SPEAK OVERWHELMINGLY IN SUPPORT OF THE
DEFENDANTS AND REQUEST THAT THE DEFENDANTS BE
ALLOWED TO SERVE THEIR PRISON TERMS TOGETHER IN
THE  SAME INSTITUTION.

INCLUDED ARE LETTERS FROM THE FOLLOWING:

FR. KEN DEASY, PASTOR OF ST. AGATHA CATHOLIC
CHURCH IN LOS ANGELES WHO COUNSELED BRIEFLY
WITH THE DEFENDANTS BEFORE THE
MURDERS AND EXTENSIVELY SINCE.

ANDREA CAPLAN OF LOS ANGELES, A FRIEND OF LYLE.

TRACY A. MILLER OF BURBANK, A JUROR IN ERIK'S
FIRST TRIAL.

SANDRA ROBINSON SHARP OF LAWRENCEVILLE, NEW
JERSEY, A FORMER HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER OF BOTH

DR. BARBARA ZUSSMAN OF STUDIO CITY WHO WAS
ERIK'S ENGLISH TEACHER AT BEVERLY HILL HIGH
SCHOOL.

JUDY GOLDSTEIN, MOTION PICTURE PRODUCER AT
APPLEDOWN FILMS IN BEVERLY HILLS.

ANN H. TYLER, Ph.D., LICENSED PSYCHOLOGIST,
WRITES, "...I HAVE A LOT OF CONCERN REGARDING THE
KIND OF PRISON THEY WILL BE SENT TO... SURELY ERIC
(SIC) CAN BE SENT TO A PRISON THAT WILL ENABLE HIM
TO LIVE SAFELY WITHOUT FEAR OF AGAIN BEING
SEXUALLY AND     PHYSICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY
ABUSED... NOT MANY PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT
PATRICIDE IS A CRIME THAT REALLY CAN NOT BE
COMPARED TO ANY OTHER VIOLENT ACTS... ERIC'S
PERCEPTION OF HIS FATHER AND MOTHER WAS THAT
THEY WERE BIGGER THAN LIFE AND MORE POWERFUL
THAN ANY HIGHER POWER..."

JOHN P. WILSON, Ph.D., CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST IN
CLEVELAND HEIGHTS, OHIO, AND DIRECTOR OF THE
CENTER FOR STRESS AND TRAUMA, WRITES, "...ERIK
HAS BEGUN TO DEVELOP INSIGHT AND UNDERSTANDING
ABOUT HIS PSYCHOPATHOLOGY. HE HAS RESPONDED
WELL TO ANTI-DEPRESSANT MEDICATION AND HAS GOOD
VERBAL SKILLS FOR PSYCHOTHERAPY. NEVERTHELESS,
HE CLEARLY IS IN NEED OF FURTHER TREATMENT AT
THIS TIME. HE IS NOT PRONE TO VIOLENCE AND
GENERALLY TRIES TO OVER-CONTROL HIS EMOTIONS
AND- SYMPTOMS. I BELIEVE THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO
MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH HIS BROTHER LYLE WOULD BE
BENEFICIAL TO HIS MENTAL HEALTH..."

DENZIL J. KLIPPEL, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF INVESTOR
SERVICES CONSULTING GROUP IN STATEN ISLAND, NEW
YORK.

ANN WOLBERT BURGESS OF WEST NEWTON,
MASSACHUSETTS, A  PSYCHIATRIC NURSE.

MARY V. WILLIAMS OF OXNARD, CALIFORNIA, FORMER
HEAD OF PRINCETON DAY SCHOOL IN PRINCETON, NEW
JERSEY.

NORMAN PULS OF WOODLAND HILLS, A FORMER MATH
AND SCIENCE TUTOR FOR ERIK.

FAITH GOLDSMITH OF FREEHOLD, NEW JERSEY.

STEPHEN B. GOLDBERG, ATTORNEY IN REDONDO BEACH
WHO HANDLED THE PROBATE OF THE VICTIM'S ESTATE,
WRITES, "...IN DISCUSSING THE EVENTS THAT
ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN THE KILLING OF HIS
PARENTS,  I SAW IN ERIK NOTHING BUT PAIN, REMORSE
AND SHAME FOR WHAT  HE HAD DONE... WHILE I
CONDEMN WHAT THEY HAVE DONE, I DO NOT BELIEVE
THAT LWOP IS TOO LENIENT A SENTENCE, SUCH THAT IT
NEEDS TO BE IMPOSED IN THE MOST PAINFUL WAY
AVAILABLE..." REGARDING LYLE, HE WRITES, "...HE HAS
A WAY OF PUTTING PEOPLE AT EASE, EVEN IN WHAT
MIGHT OTHERWISE BE CONFRONTIVE SITUATIONS. HE IS
FUNNY WITHOUT BEING MEAN, AND IS WILLING TO
LAUGH AT HIMSELF. WITH HIS  STRONG BUT PLEASANT
PERSONALITY, COMBINED WITH HIS INTELLIGENCE, HE
HAS THE ABILITY TO HELP OTHERS ACCOMPLISH THEIR
GOALS. PROPERLY PLACED, THIS STRENGTH SHOULD
ALLOW HIM TO BE AN ASSET IN THE RIGHT
INSTITUTION... THE DECISION AS TO WHERE LYLE WILL
SERVE HIS SENTENCE, BOTH AS TO THE CHOICE OF
FACILITY, AND AS TO WHETHER OR NOT LYLE AND ERIK
WILL BE TOGETHER, IS CRITICAL... PLACED TOGETHER,  I
BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE THE HEALING
PROCESS THAT EACH HAS BEGUN..."

HARRY HADERIS, II, OF BEVERLY HILLS.

ANDREW PIERCE, ATTORNEY IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA.

WILLIAM VICARY, J.D., M.D., FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIST IN
LOS ANGELES, WHO HAS BEEN TREATING ERIK IN JAIL
SINCE JUNE, 1990, WRITES THAT ERIK WAS INITIALLY SO
DEPRESSED THAT HE HAD  PSYCHOTIC-LIKE SYMPTOMS
AND HAD TO BE TREATED WITH LARGE DOSES OF
TRANQUILIZING AND ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATIONS.
HOWEVER, HIS SYMPTOMS SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED
AND HIS MENTAL CONDITION IS NOW RELATIVELY
STABLE. BUT HE CONTINUES TO SUFFER FROM
MODERATE DEPRESSION AND IS BEING TREATED WITH
150 mg. OF PAMELOR DAILY. HE ALSO RECEIVES INDERAL
AND XANEX FOR ANXIETY.

STUART N. HART, Ph.D., PSYCHOLOGIST, IS PROFESSOR
OF COUNSELING AND EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY AT
INDIANA UNIVERSITY AND PURDUE UNIVERSITY IN
INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA, ALSO IN PRIVATE PRACTICE,
SPECIALIZING IN CHILD AND ADOLESCENT
DEVELOPMENT AND PARTICULARLY IN PSYCHOLOGICAL
EXPERIENCES AND THEIR IMPACT, WRITES, "IT IS MY
PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT THAT (A) ERIK AND LYLE
WORKED HARD THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES TO PLEASE
THEIR PARENTS AND MEET THEIR  EXTREMELY
DEMANDING REQUIREMENTS; AND (B) THEY WERE
SEVERELY PSYCHOLOGICALLY MALTREATED
THROUGHOUT MOST OF THEIR LIVES AND, AS A RESULT,
WHEN THEY KILLED THEIR PARENTS THEY WERE
IMMATURE, FEARFUL, DEPENDENT, BELIEVED
THEMSELVES ISOLATED FROM HELP, AND THEY WERE
SERIOUSLY LIMITED IN THEIR ABILITY TO DEAL WITH
PERCEIVED THREATS  AND SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THEY
FACED. MY STUDY OF THEIR LIVES DID NOT SUPPORT
THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY KILLED THEIR PARENTS
BECAUSE OF GREED OR HATE... I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT
LYLE OR ERIK REPRESENT A DANGER TO ANYONE BUT,
RATHER, THAT THEY EACH COULD BE ENDANGERED BY
PLACEMENT IN THE PROXIMITY OF VIOLENT
CRIMINALS... THE NOTORIETY THEY HAVE RECEIVED,
THEIR YOUTHFUL GOOD LOOKS, MISIMPRESSIONS THAT
THEY WERE SPOILED BRATS, AND PUBLIC EXPOSURE OF
ALLEGATIONS THAT THEY WERE SEXUALLY ABUSED
WILL MAKE THEM PRIME TARGETS FOR PHYSICAL
AGGRESSION, CRUELTY, AND SEXUAL ATTACK FROM
PRISON INMATES ... OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, THE
VAST MAJORITY OF THE DEFENDANTS' EXTENDED
FAMILY, "HAVE RALLIED AROUND THEM PROVIDING
ESSENTIAL SUPPORT AND MEANING IN THEIR LIVES..."
DR. HART HAS ALREADY SET IN MOTION STEPS BY
WHICH THE DEFENDANTS MAY ENROLL IN INDIANA
UNIVERSITY'S CORRESPONDENCE PROGRAMS. HE WILL
HELP THEM, "... DEVELOP COMPETENCIES AND
INTERESTS IN WAYS WHICH WILL HELP THEM REDEEM
THEMSELVES AND SERVE OTHERS. I STRONGLY
RECOMMEND THAT LYLE AND ERIK BE PLACED IN THE
SAME INSTITUTION AND THAT IT BE ONE WHICH WILL
PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THEIR THERAPEUTIC AND
EDUCATIONAL NEED, AND FOR THEIR DESIRE TO BE OF
USE TO OTHERS..."

JANET S. STOLTZFUS OF PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY, A
FORMER SCHOOL TEACHER OF ERIK AT PRINCETON DAY
SCHOOL.

ANAMARIA BARALT OF MIAMI BEACH, FLORIDA, THE
DEFENDANT'S COUSIN, WRITES THAT THE DEFENDANTS
ARE TWO OF THE MOST GIFTED PEOPLE SHE HAS EVER
KNOWN. "...THEY HAVE SO MUCH TO OFFER TO     THE
WORLD, IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO SEE IT GO WASTED..."
LYLE WAS DEPICTED AS A "HEARTLESS, CRUEL TYRANT,"
A "MONSTER." HOWEVER, HE IS, "...THE MOST LOYAL
PERSON I'VE EVER MET... SENSITIVE TO A FLAW... HE IS
KIND AND GENEROUS... I NEVER FELT SAFER THAN
WHEN I WAS WITH LYLE BECAUSE I KNEW HE WOULD DO
ANYTHING TO PROTECT ME, OR  ANYONE ELSE THAT HE
LOVED... BUT LYLE'S STRONGEST TIE IS WITH HIS
BROTHER, ERIK, FOR WHOM HE WOULD DO ANYTHING..."
THEIR MOST OUTSTANDING TRAIT IS "THEIR FIERCE
ATTACHMENT AND LOYALTY TO EACH OTHER. THEY'RE
MORE THAN JUST BROTHERS, THEY'RE BEST FRIENDS.
THEY NEED EACH OTHER IN SO MANY WAYS, THEY
ALWAYS HAVE. I HOPE YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THEIR
NEED TO BE TOGETHER. EQUALLY IMPRESSIVE IS THE
SUPPORT THEY'VE RECEIVED FROM OUR FAMILY AND
WILL CONTINUE TO IN THE FUTURE. PLEASE TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION THE REST OF US AS THEIR  FAMILY AND
OUR NEEDS TO HAVE THEM IN THE SAME PLACE TO VISIT.
THE FAMILY HASN'T CUT THEM OFF BECAUSE OF WHAT
HAS HAPPENED... MANY OF US WILL WANT TO VISIT
THEM IN THE FUTURE, BUT SINCE ALMOST EVERYONE IN
THE FAMILY LIVES OUTSIDE OF THE STATE OF
CALIFORNIA, IT IS IMPORTANT TO US THAT THEY (BE)
CLOSE TOGETHER..."

JOHN C. BURNETT OF PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY, A
FORMER CLASSMATE AND "BEST FRIEND" OF ERIK
WRITES THAT ERIK, "...HAS NEVER COME ACROSS TO ME
(AS) A 'SPOILED BRAT' AS THE MEDIA WOULD HAVE (HIM)
PORTRAYED AS, BUT RATHER A MAN WITH A BIG HEART
WHO'S (SIC) BIGGEST FAULT WAS THAT HE FELT THAT
HE COULD NEVER LIVE UP TO THE EXPECTATIONS THAT
WERE PLACED UPON HIM FROM THE TIME HE WAS
BORN."

JOAN VANDER MOLEN OF PAYSON, ARIZONA, THE
DEFENDANT'S MATERNAL AUNT WRITES THAT SHE IS
CONCERNED FOR THE SAFETY OF HER NEPHEWS. "...
THEY ARE WORTHWHILE PEOPLE WHO, IF ALLOWED,
WILL MAKE A CONTRIBUTION WITH THEIR LIVES. THEY
ARE NOT THE MEAN-SPIRITED YOUNG MEN THEY HAVE
BEEN PORTRAYED TO BE AND IN SPITE OF THEIR SIX
YEARS OF INCARCERATION, ARE STILL NAIVE ABOUT THE
WORLD THEY ARE ABOUT TO ENTER."

ADDITIONAL LETTERS MAY BE ATTACHED THAT WERE
RECEIVED AFTER THE PREPARATION OF THIS REPORT. IN
ADDITION, PERSONAL CONTACT WAS MADE WITH THE
FOLLOWING PEOPLE.

JUDY GOLDSTEIN, FILM PRODUCER AT APPLEDOWN
FILMS IN BEVERLY HILLS, STATES SHE HAS KNOWN THE
DEFENDANTS FOR THE LAST TWO AND ONE-HALF YEARS,
BUT HAS PRIMARILY BEEN INVOLVED WITH LYLE. SHE
HOPES THEY ARE KEPT TOGETHER IN PRISON. THEY
HAVE AN INCREDIBLE BOND AND THEY FEAR BEING
SEPARATED. "I HAVE A GREAT CONCERN FOR THEM
GOING INTO THE PRISON SYSTEM. THESE ARE NORMAL,
SOFT GUYS ... I WONDER HOW THEY WILL COPE WHEN
THEY COME UP AGAINST SOME OF THOSE  GUYS (IN
PRISON)... THEY HAVE NO CAPACITY TOWARD
VIOLENCE... (THE PRESENT OFFENSE) IS BEYOND
TRAGIC."


TERESITA (TERRY) BARALT, THE DEFENDANT'S
PATERNAL AUNT, IN PRINCETON JUNCTION, NEW
JERSEY, STATES, "I'M DEVASTATED BY WHAT HAS
HAPPENED... IT WAS A TRAGEDY..." THE DEFENDANTS
ARE NOT BAD KIDS. "IT WAS A HORRENDOUS MOMENT AT
A HORRENDOUS TIME IN THEIR LIVES." THE WORLD SEES
THEM AS CRIMINALS, BUT SHE HAS SEEN THEM BOTH
COME A LONG WAY. ERIK HAS BECOME A GREAT HUMAN
BEING WITH A LOT TO OFFER THE WORLD. PLEASE DO
NOT SEPARATE THEM. THEY ARE ALL THEY HAVE LEFT.
THEY ARE NOT A MENACE TO SOCIETY.

MARIA MENENDEZ, THE DEFENDANT'S PATERNAL
GRANDMOTHER, STATES THE DEFENDANTS WERE VERY
NICE CHILDREN. SHE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT
HAPPENED.

MARTA MENENDEZ-CANO, THE DEFENDANT'S PATERNAL
AUNT IN NORTH PALM BEACH, FLORIDA, STATES SHE
HAS GRADUALLY COME TO REALIZE THE LYING AND
DECEIT THAT WAS FOSTERED BY THE VICTIMS IN THEIR
FAMILY. THE DEFENDANTS FEARED THEIR FATHER.
WHEN ERIK WAS 12, HE WAS BEATEN BY HIS FATHER
FOR SUSPICION OF TELLING LYLE ABOUT THE SEXUAL
ABUSE THAT WAS GOING ON BETWEEN HIM AND HIS
FATHER. THE SECRECY THAT IS TYPICAL IN SEXUAL
ABUSE CASES WAS EVIDENCED BY THE  ANGER JOSE
WOULD SHOW IF ANYONE CAME TO THEIR HOUSE
UNEXPECTEDLY. ERIK WAS NOT ALLOWED TO CALL, OR
RECEIVE CALLS FROM HIS COUSIN, ANDY (HER SON).
WHEN LYLE WAS 17, HE WAS ALLOWED TO LIVE IN A
COTTAGE AT THE REAR OF THE FAMILY'S PROPERTY IN
PRINCETON. AT THE TIME, MARTA THOUGHT THIS WAS
UNSAFE AND UNWISE FOR LYLE. HOWEVER, SHE NOW
BELIEVES THIS WAS DONE SO LYLE COULD NOT SEE OR
HEAR WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE BETWEEN ERIK AND
THEIR FATHER. IF ERIK GOT SICK AT SCHOOL, HE WOULD
BEG HIS TEACHERS NOT TO CALL HIS PARENTS. IF HE
STAYED HOME SICK, HIS MOTHER WOULD PUT HIM IN
THE CLOSET AND MAKE HIM STAY THERE FROM 8:00 A.M.
TO 3:00 P.M. HE WOULD BE PUNISHED GREATER IF HE
CAME OUT OF THE CLOSET WITHOUT PERMISSION. ANDY
IS THE ONLY ONE WHO KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO
ERIK. ONE TIME, JOSE SAT ERIK AND ANDY DOWN IN THE
DEN TO SHOW THEM AN "EDUCATIONAL VIDEO. THE
VIDEO TURNED OUT TO BE HARD CORE PORNOGRAPHY.
AFTER THE    MURDERS, THEY FOUND A STACK OF
PORNOGRAPHIC VIDEOS IN THE DEN WHERE THE
MURDERS TOOK PLACE. JOSE WAS A VERY
PSYCHOLOGICALLY STRONG PERSON. THERE IS NO WAY
THE DEFENDANTS COULD RUN AWAY FROM HIM. HE WAS
SICK. "KITTY" ALSO HAD A NEUROTIC PERSONALITY.
YOU NEVER KNEW  WHAT TO EXPECT FROM HER. SHE
ATTEMPTED SUICIDE TWICE, BUT NO ONE ELSE KNEW
ABOUT IT. ALSO, NO ONE KNEW JOSE HAD A GIRLFRIEND
FOR SIX YEARS. THE FAMILY HAD EVERYTHING, BUT
THEY WERE ALWAYS SO SAD ERIK TOLD HER THAT
COUNTY JAIL IS BETTER THAN IT WAS IN HIS HOME. HE
SAID ANDY WAS LUCKY BECAUSE HE HAD A LOCK ON
HIS BEDROOM DOOR. SHE BELIEVES JOSE COULD NOT
STOP WHAT HE WAS DOING TO ERIK EVEN THOUGH HE
KNEW HE WAS DESTROYING THE FAMILY.
NEVERTHELESS, WHAT THE DEFENDANTS DID WAS
WRONG. THEY DESERVE TO BE PUNISHED, BUT NOT
WITH LIFE IN PRISON. TWENTY YEARS ON A
MANSLAUGHTER CONVICTION WOULD BE MORE
APPROPRIATE. NO ONE CAN EVER PUNISH THEM FOR
WHAT THEY HAVE INSIDE. THEY SHOULD ALSO HAVE
MANDATORY PSYCHOTHERAPY. HOWEVER, THEY ARE
NOT A MENACE TO SOCIETY AND THEY NEED TO BE KEPT
TOGETHER.

DIANE VANDER MOLEN, THE DEFENDANTS COUSIN IN
MESA, ARIZONA, STATES HER AUNT "KITTY" WAS HER
MENTOR IN LIFE. "I ADORED HER." HOWEVER, DIANE
NOTICED A HUGE CHANGE IN KITTY'S BEHAVIOR. WHEN
ERIK WAS ABOUT ELEVEN YEARS OLD, SHE SAW HIM
SOBBING ABOUT SOMETHING. WHEN SHE WENT TO
COMFORT HIM, KITTY PHYSICALLY STOPPED HER AND
SAID, "WE DON'T HUG ERIK ANYMORE." WHAT ERIK AND
LYLE DID WAS WRONG, BUT KNOWING WHAT THE
VICTIMS WERE LIKE, SHE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THIS
COULD HAPPEN. THE DEFENDANTS HAD AN
OVERWHELMING DESIRE TO BE ACCEPTED BY THEIR
PARENTS. BUT DIANE NEVER HEARD JOSE AND KITTY
EXPRESS LOVE TO THEM. IN FACT, KITTY TOLD HER,
"YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE KIDS. THEY ONLY DRIVE A
WEDGE BETWEEN A MAN AND HIS WIFE."

LESLIE H. ABRAMSON, THE DEFENDANT'S ATTORNEY,
WRITES IN THE ATTACHED LETTER THAT THE
DEFENDANT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED A MODEL INMATE IN
JAIL BY THE DEPUTY SHERIFFS WHO HAVE BEEN
INVOLVED WITH HIM. "ERIK HAS THE KIND OF
PERSONALITY AND ATTITUDE THAT GUARANTEES HIS
COOPERATION AND COMPLIANCE WITH DIRECTIONS...
LYLE AND ERIK ARE EXTREMELY CLOSE AND
SUPPORTIVE OF EACH OTHER... GIVEN THEIR LIFE TERMS
WITHOUT POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE IT WOULD BE
UNNECESSARILY CRUEL TO SEPARATE THEM NOW.
MOREOVER, KEEPING THEM TOGETHER WOULD PROVIDE
THE BEST PROTECTION FOR EACH OF THEM ... OUR
SECOND CONCERN IS THAT THEY BE SAFE FROM ATTACK
BY OTHER INMATES..."  SHE WRITES THAT THE REPORTS
OF THEIR BEING MOLESTED BY THEIR FATHER AND THE
UNTRUE REPORTS THAT THE DEFENDANT IS A
HOMOSEXUAL MAKE THEM LIKELY TARGETS FOR
ASSAULT IN PRISON. THIRDLY, SHE REQUESTS THAT THE
DEFENDANT CONTINUE TO RECEIVE PSYCHIATRIC
TREATMENT FOR POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER
AND DEPRESSION AS HE HAS FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS.
FOURTHLY, SHE REQUESTS THAT THE DEFENDANTS,
"...BE CONFINED IN AN INSTITUTION THAT WILL ALLOW
THEM TO PURSUE THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS... ERIK
HAS INDICATED HIS INTEREST IN OBTAINING A Ph.D. IN
PSYCHOLOGY... THEIR SIX YEAR INCARCERATION HAS
BEEN TOUGH AND THEIR SENTENCE TOTALLY
DISPROPORTIONATE TO THEIR TRUE CULPABILITY. THEY,
HOWEVER, ARE NOT TOUGH AT ALL. NOR ARE THEY
BITTER OR DEFEATED. THEIR DESIRE IS TO FIND A WAY
TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL LIFE IN SPITE OF
EVERYTHING... THE MENENDEZ BROTHERS ARE THE
LEAST DANGEROUS, THE LEAST ASOCIAL, THE LEAST
MEAN SPIRITED, THE LEAST NARCISSISTIC AND THE
MOST TALENTED AND PROMISING OF VIRTUALLY ALL MY
OTHER CLIENTS...ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE FOR
THEM THAT WILL LESSEN TO ANY DEGREE THE LIFETIME
OF SUFFERING THAT THEY MUST ENDURE WILL BE A
BLESSING."

BRIAN ANDERSEN, DEFENDANT'S MATERNAL UNCLE, IN
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, STATES THE DEFENDANTS WERE
MOVING TOWARD A LIFE OF CRIME ANYWAY, BOTH IN
SCHOOL AND THE COMMUNITY. THEY WERE IN A
BURGLARY RING IN CALABASAS AND WERE "ROBBING"
HOMES. THE STORY OF THE MOLESTATIONS WAS
ABSOLUTELY MADE UP. THE STORY OF PARENTAL ABUSE
WAS CONJURED UP. "I VIEW THE ABUSE DEFENSE
AS ONE OF THE BIGGEST LIES TO BE TOLD TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE... THE DEFENDANTS WERE BROUGHT
UP BY THEIR FATHER TO WORK WITHIN AND
WITHOUT THE "SYSTEM" AS LONG AS IT SERVED THEIR
PURPOSES. HE THINKS THAT JOSE INTENDED TO
DEMONSTRATE AN AGGRESSIVE APPROACH TO THE
SYSTEM. HOWEVER, LYLE INTERPRETED THIS TO MEAN
THAT LIFE DID NOT HAVE ANY PARAMETERS AT ALL AND
HE DEVELOPED AN SOCIOPATHIC MENTALITY. HE COULD
LIE HIS WAY OUT OF ANY PROBLEM. HE WILL BE A
PROBLEM IN THE PENAL SYSTEM, TESTING LIMITS
WHEREVER HE IS PLACED. ERIK, HOWEVER, DOES NOT
SHARE THE SAME AGGRESSIVE SOCIOPATHIC
MENTALITY. IF HE IS SEPARATED FROM LYLE, HE WILL
FIND A WAY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SOCIETY HE IS IN.
BUT IF THE TWO ARE KEPT  TOGETHER, HE WILL BE
CORRUPTED BY LYLE. MR. ANDERSEN FEELS THE
DEFENDANTS COMMITTED THE PRESENT OFFENSE FOR A
VARIETY OF REASONS. JOSE WAS A DOMINANT FORCE; A
CONTROL FREAK. LYLE WANTED TO DO WHAT HE
WANTED TO DO, BUT JOSE DID EVERYTHING HE COULD
TO INHIBIT LYLE'S EXTRANEOUS ACTIVITY. LYLE
RESENTED THIS AND INTERPRETED THIS CONTROL AS
DEMEANING AND BELITTLING; HIS EGO COULD NOT DEAL
WITH THIS AND HE WANTED TO ELIMINATE JOSE'S
CONTROL OVER HIS LIFE. KITTY, MR. ANDERSEN'S
SISTER, WAS MUCH EASIER TO MANEUVER AROUND.
HOWEVER, HER AGREEMENT WITH JOSE'S PRINCIPLES
WAS A PROBLEM TO THE  DEFENDANTS. THEY HAD TO
ELIMINATE JOSE'S CONTROL OVER THEM. BUT  TO BE
FINANCIALLY FREE, KITTY ALSO HAD TO BE ELIMINATED.
HER DEATH WAS ONLY FOR GREED - TO INHERIT ALL THE
MONEY.

EVALUATION:
UNLIKE HIS YOUNGER BROTHER, ERIK, THE DEFENDANT
WAS ALLOWED A MEASURE OF FREEDOM AND TRUST BY
HIS PARENTS, THE VICTIMS,   HOWEVER, HE ALSO WAS
REPORTEDLY VICTIMIZED BY HIS FATHER AS A CHILD,
BOTH SEXUALLY AND PHYSICALLY. MUCH HAS BEEN
SAID ABOUT HIS AFFLUENT LIFESTYLE AS A YOUNG
MAN, HIS THIRST FOR MONEY AND HIS EXTRAVAGANT
LIFESTYLE FOLLOWING THE MURDERS OF HIS PARENTS.
HOWEVER, THE COURT CANNOT IGNORE THE
OVERWHELMING SUPPORT OF HIS RELATIVES WHO WERE
ALSO DEEPLY HURT AND EFFECTED BY THIS VIOLENT
ACT. HE HAS FULLY ADMITTED HIS INVOLVEMENT AND
RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS MATTER. HOWEVER, IN THE
WORDS OF ONE OF HIS AUNTS, "IT WAS A HORRENDOUS
MOMENT AT A HORRENDOUS TIME IN THEIR LIVES."
DEFENDANT HAS NO OTHER HISTORY OF VIOLENT OR
AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR, BEFORE OR SINCE THOSE
FATEFUL SECONDS. HE WAS A YOUNG 21-YEAR--OLD
MAN, INTELLIGENT, TALENTED, GOOD-LOOKING, NO
DOUBT OVER-INDULGED, AND LOOKING FORWARD TO
BECOMING A PART OF HIS FATHER'S BUSINESS UPON HIS
GRADUATION. HE HAD ACCESS TO CREDIT CARDS AND
THE FAMILY'S BANK ACCOUNT. AS THE OLDER
BROTHER, HE SHOULD HAVE HAD AN INFLUENCE ON THE
CO-DEFENDANT. HOWEVER, SOMETHING CONVINCED
HIM THAT HE NEEDED TO ARM HIMSELF AND COMMIT
SUCH A TREMENDOUS ACT OF VIOLENCE.

IN THE SIX YEARS SINCE HIS ARREST, HE HAS GAINED
THE SUPPORT OF HIS RELATIVES WHO WERE INITIALLY
INCENSED BY WHAT THEY SAW ONLY AS AN ACT OF
GREED AND HATE. HE HAS ALSO MAINTAINED OLD AND
ESTABLISHED NEW RELATIONSHIPS. HE IS EXPECTED TO
SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE IN PRISON, AND RIGHTLY
SO. IT IS SUGGESTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE COURT AND
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS GIVE CONSIDERATION TO
PLACING HIM IN AN INSTITUTION THAT WILL ALLOW HIM
TO REMAIN CLOSE TO HIS BROTHER, NOT ONLY FOR HIS
SAKE BUT FOR RELATIVES, AND TO PARTICIPATE IN THE
FURTHERANCE OF HIS EDUCATIONAL GOALS. HE IS NOT
CONSIDERED AN ESCAPE THREAT OR A DANGER TO
HIMSELF OR OTHERS, AND IS  EXPECTED TO BECOME AN
ASSET TO ANY INSTITUTION IN WHICH HE IS PLACED.

SENTENCING CONSIDERATIONS:

THE DEFENDANT IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR PROBATION
PURSUANT TO 1203.075(A)(1) PC.

AGGRAVATING FACTORS:
NONE.

MITIGATING FACTORS:
NONE.

FURTHERMORE, THE DEFENDANT IS INELIGIBLE FOR
PROBATION PURSUANT TO 1203(E)(2) PENAL CODE
UNLESS THE COURT DETERMINES THIS IS AN UNUSUAL
CASE.

AS THIS IS AN INDETERMINATE SENTENCING MATTER,
FACTORS OF AGGRAVATION AND MITIGATION ARE
IRRELEVANT.

RECOMMENDATION:

IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT PROBATION BE DENIED AND
THAT THE DEFENDANT BE SENTENCED AS PRESCRIBED
BY LAW.

ELEMENTS AND RELEVANT CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE
OFFENSES:

THE DEFENDANTS CONSPIRED TOGETHER AND
MURDERED JOSE ENRIQUE MENENDEZ (AGE 45) AND
MARY LOUISE "KITTY" (ANDERSEN) MENENDEZ (AGE 48),
THEIR PARENTS AT THEIR BEVERLY HILLS HOME.

IN THE SPRING OF 1989, THE CO-DEFENDANT STOLE AN
IDENTIFICATION CARD FROM HIS ROOMMATE AT
COLLEGE. ON AUGUST 18, 1989, THE DEFENDANTS DROVE
TO SAN DIEGO COUNTY WHERE THE DEFENDANT
USED THIS IDENTIFICATION CARD TO PURCHASE TWO
IDENTICAL MOSSBURG 12-GAUGE SHOTGUNS CAPABLE
OF HOLDING FIVE ROUNDS IN ADDITION TO ONE ROUND
IN THE CHAMBER. THEY ALSO LATER PURCHASED SOME
BUCK (.33 CALIBER PELLETS) SHELLS IN ADDITION TO
THE "BIRDSHOT" THEY OBTAINED AT THE TIME OF THE
ORIGINAL GUN PURCHASE.

ON THE NIGHT OF AUGUST 20, 1989, THE DEFENDANTS
LOADED THEIR GUNS WITH ROUNDS OF 4 BUCK EACH. AT
ABOUT 10:00 OR 10:15 P.M., THE DEFENDANTS BURST
INTO THE FAMILY DEN WHERE THE VICTIMS WERE
SITTING ON THE COUCH. ALL TEN ROUNDS WERE FIRED
AT THE VICTIMS AND ALL BUT ONE FOUND THEIR
MARKS. (ONE ROUND WAS A COMPLETE MISS AND WENT
THROUGH A SHUTTER AND WINDOW BEHIND THE
VICTIMS.) BECAUSE VICTIM "KITTY" APPEARED TO BE
STILL MOVING, THE DEFENDANTS THEN WENT TO THE
CO-DEFENDANT'S CAR WHERE THE DEFENDANT
RETRIEVED ONE OR TWO SHELLS  OF BIRDSHOT. HE GAVE
THE SHELL TO THE CO-DEFENDANT WHO RETURNED TO
THE SCENE OF THE CRIME AND SHOT VICTIM "KITTY" IN
THE FACE AT POINT BLANK RANGE. AFTER PICKING UP
THE EMPTY SHELLS, THEY LEFT TO GET RID OF THE
GUNS AND BLOODY CLOTHING AND ATTEMPTED TO
ESTABLISH  AN ALIBI BY MEETING WITH A FRIEND.
WHEN THEY WERE UNSUCCESSFUL IN
ESTABLISHING CONTACT WITH THIS PERSON, THEY
RETURNED TO THE HOUSE AND CALLED THE BEVERLY
HILLS POLICE DEPARTMENT AT 11:47 P.M. TO REPORT THE
MURDERS. AFTER BEING QUESTIONED BY THE POLICE,
THEY RETURNED TO THE HOUSE AND WERE ABLE TO
REMOVE THE WRAPPINGS AND PAPERS FROM THE GUNS
AND AMMUNITION THAT HAD BEEN LEFT IN THE CO-
DEFENDANT'S CAR.

JUVENILE HISTORY:

9-16-88
LASD/MALIBU - 459 PC (BURGLARY), 487.1 PC (GRAND
THEFT PROPERTY) - 1-20-89, JUVENILE COURT PETITION
FILED, REFERRED TO PROBATION DEPT. FOR
CONSIDERATION RE 654 WIC; 3-7-89, MINOR IS ACCEPTED
FOR SUPERVISION PER 654 WIC, PETITION DISMISSED,
CASE DISMISSED;  9-6-89, CASE EXPIRED.

(AROUND JULY 4, 1988, WHILE VISITING A FRIEND,
DEFENDANT AND HIS FRIEND, CRAIG, DECIDED TO PLAY
A JOKE ON THE FRIEND, WHOSE PARENTS WERE OUT OF
THE COUNTRY, BY MOVING HIS VEHICLE. WHILE
LOOKING FOR THE KEYS, THEY FOUND OTHER KEYS AND
THE COMBINATION TO THE FAMILY SAFE. THEY OPENED
THE SAFE AND FOUND A LARGE AMOUNT OF JEWELRY
AND ABOUT $2,000 IN CASH THEY REMOVED THE
VALUABLES FROM THE SAFE AND HID THEM. ON JULY 14,
1988, A NEIGHBOR OF A SECOND VICTIM, WHO WAS ALSO
OUT OF TOWN, OBSERVED DEFENDANT ENTER THE
SECOND VICTIM'S HOME THROUGH THE REAR
ENTRANCE. WHEN THE VICTIM RETURNED HOME
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER, HE DISCOVERED THAT THE
HOUSE HAD BEEN BURGLARIZED AND A CONSIDERABLE
AMOUNT OF JEWELRY AND OTHER ITEMS HAD BEEN
TAKEN. DEFENDANT NOW ADMITS THAT HE AND THE CO-
DEFENDANT COMMITTED THIS THEFT. THEY TOOK A
SOLARFLEX MACHINE, POTTERY, PAINTINGS, THE
FAMILY SAFE AND OTHER ITEMS. HE KNEW THE SECOND
VICTIM'S DAUGHTER FROM SCHOOL. HE TRIED TO UNDO
WHAT THEY DID BEFORE THE VICTIMS RETURNED HOME,
BUT THEY ENDED UP PUTTING SOME OF THE SECOND
VICTIM'S PROPERTY IN THE FIRST VICTIM'S SAFE. HE
NEVER TOLD THE POLICE ABOUT CRAIG'S OR THE CO-
DEFENDANT'S INVOLVEMENT BECAUSE HIS FATHER DID
NOT WANT THE CO-DEFENDANT TO GET ARRESTED.
DEFENDANT WAS QUESTIONED AND ADMITTED THE
CRIMES. HE RETURNED MOST OF THE STOLEN PROPERTY
WHICH HAD AN ESTIMATED VALUE OF $100,000. BOTH
VICTIMS TOLD THE PROBATION OFFICER AT THE TIME
THAT THEIR LOSSES HAD BEEN PAID IN FULL BY THE
DEFENDANT AND HIS FAMILY. DEFENDANT STATED, "I
DON'T KNOW WHY I DID IT... MAYBE I WAS JUST BORED
AND FRUSTRATED...BECAUSE I HAD INJURED MY ANKLE
AND COULDN'T PLAY TENNIS. WHATEVER, I DID DO IT
AND I'M VERY SORRY. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE UP
FOR IT BY WORKING WITH THE HOMELESS DOWN AT ST.
JOSEPH CENTER IN VENICE - AND I'M GOING TO PAY MY
PARENTS BACK AS SOON AS I CAN. I'M SURE I WILL
NEVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS AGAIN.")

RECORDS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES

JUVENILE TRAFFIC COURT IN 1987 AND 1988. HE
SUSTAINED TWO CONVICTIONS EACH FOR 22349 VC

DEFENDANT STATEMENT:

WHEN HE WAS SIX YEARS OLD, HIS FATHER BEGAN TO
MOLEST  HIM MAKING DEFENDANT "MASSAGE" AND
ORALLY COPULATE HIM. WHEN HE WAS 12, HE BEGAN TO
ENGAGE IN SODOMY. DURING THE SUMMER OF 1983, HE
RAN AWAY FROM HOME. HIS FATHER BROUGHT HIM
BACK HOME AND THREATENED HIM STATING, "YOU'LL
NEVER BE ABLE TO GET AWAY FROM ME." AFTER THEY
MOVED TO CALIFORNIA IN 1986, THE CHILD ABUSE
STOPPED FOR AWHILE. HOWEVER, A WEEK BEFORE HE
TURNED 16 (NOVEMBER, 1986), FATHER ENTERED HIS
ROOM, ORDERED DEFENDANT TO GET ON HIS KNEES AND
ORALLY COPULATE HIM. THIS CONTINUED TO OCCUR
EVERY ONE TO THREE MONTHS UNTIL AUGUST 10, 1989,
TEN DAYS BEFORE THE PRESENT OFFENSE. DEFENDANT
WAS TO START AT U.C.L.A. IN THE FALL SEMESTER AND
WAS GOING TO BE LIVING IN A CAMPUS DORM.
HOWEVER, ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE THE PRESENT
OFFENSE, FATHER TOLD DEFENDANT THAT HE WOULD BE
COMING HOME SEVERAL NIGHTS A WEEK SO FATHER
COULD GO OVER HIS HOMEWORK. THIS UPSET
DEFENDANT BECAUSE HE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO
GETTING AWAY FROM FATHER, AND THIS WOULD GIVE
FATHER CONTINUING OPPORTUNITIES TO ABUSE HIM.
HE TOLD LYLE WHAT FATHER WAS DOING AND "LYLE
GOT ANGRY WITH ME." LYLE LATER  CONFRONTED
FATHER WHO, IN TURN, GOT UPSET WITH DEFENDANT
FOR TELLING LYLE. FATHER BELIEVED LYLE WAS GOING
TO TELL THE AUTHORITIES WHAT HE WAS DOING AND HE
WAS NOT GOING TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. LYLE
THOUGHT THEY SHOULD RUN AWAY, BUT DEFENDANT
SAID, "NO. WHERE WOULD WE GO? FATHER WOULD FIND
US ANYWAY." THEY DECIDED THEY NEED TO GET SOME
HANDGUNS FOR PROTECTION. THEY GOT IN LYLE'S CAR
AND DROVE TOWARD SAN DIEGO. THEY GOT AS FAR AS
LA JOLLA WHERE THEY WENT INTO A GUN STORE.
HOWEVER, THEY WERE TOLD THEY WOULD HAVE TO
WAIT 15 DAYS BEFORE PURCHASING A HANDGUN. THEY
THEN WENT TO A NEARBY "BIG 5" SPORTING GOODS
STORE AND USED AN IDENTIFICATION CARD BELONGING
TO ONE OF LYLE'S FRIENDS TO PURCHASE TWO 12-
GAUGE SHOTGUNS. THE NEXT DAY, THEY BOUGHT SOME
BUCK SHOT AT A STORE IN LOS ANGELES. THE TENSION
IN THE FAMILY WAS VERY HIGH AND THEY WERE
CONVINCED THAT FATHER WAS GOING TO DO
SOMETHING SOON TO SILENCE THEM. HOWEVER, ON
SATURDAY, AUGUST 19, 1989, THEY ALL WENT ON A
SHARK FISHING TRIP. DEFENDANT THOUGHT THIS WAS
ODD BECAUSE THEY SHOULD INSTEAD STAY HOME AND
WORK OUT THEIR PROBLEMS. ABOUT MIDNIGHT,
FATHER CAME UP TO HIS BEDROOM AND ORDERED
DEFENDANT TO UNLOCK THE DOOR. DEFENDANT
DECIDED HE WAS NOT GOING TO HAVE SEX WITH HIM
AGAIN. FATHER HAD A VIOLENT TEMPER, BUT
DEFENDANT JUST SAT ON HIS BED WITH THE SHOTGUN
ON HIS  LAP. FATHER FINALLY WENT AWAY STATING HE
'WOULD HAVE TO COME OUT SOMETIME. HE NEVER
THOUGHT OF GOING OUTSIDE FOR HELP; HE NEVER
THOUGHT OF GOING TO HIS AUNT'S; HE NEVER SAT
DOWN AND THOUGHT THOUGH THE SITUATION. "IWISH I
HAD RUN AWAY, BUT IT WAS DRILLED INTO ME TO
NEVER GO OUTSIDE OF THE FAMILY (FOR HELP)."
MOTHER SAID SHE KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING
BETWEEN DEFENDANT AND FATHER. DEFENDANT THEN
SAW HER AS THIS HORRIBLE WOMAN WHO CONSPIRED
WITH HIS FATHER.

"I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO THINK THAT THE HORROR OF
WHAT WE DID (HAS NOT AFFECTED US)." I WANT PEOPLE
TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH I WISH WE COULD GO
BACK AND CHANGE WHAT HAPPENED... FROM THE  VERY
FIRST NIGHT, I REALIZED THE HORROR OF WHAT
HAPPENED AND WHAT A MISTAKE WAS MADE." HE DID
DIFFERENT THINGS TO TRY TO RELIEVE THE PAIN. "I WAS
TRYING TO LIVE THE LIFE THAT MY FATHER WOULD
WANT. THE NEXT SIX MONTHS WERE "THE WORST SIX
MONTHS OF MY LIFE. HIS ARREST WAS A RELIEF. THEY
HAVE BOTH GONE TO THEIR PARENTS GRAVES TO TALK
TO THEM ABOUT WHAT  HAPPENED. IF HE COULD ONLY
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TALK TO HIS MOTHER BEFORE, THIS
ALL MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE AVOIDED. A COUPLE
DAYS AFTER THE MURDERS, HE WAS SHOCKED TO FIND
OUT THAT MOTHER HAD BEEN TAPE RECORDING HIS
TELEPHONE CALLS. IF HE HAD KNOWN THIS, HE WOULD
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TALK TO HER INDIRECTLY THOUGH
THE TELEPHONE. HE SEES A PSYCHIATRIST EVERY WEEK
IN JAIL. HOWEVER, "I DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE MADE
IT HERE WITHOUT LYLE."

INTERESTED PARTIES:

LES ZOELLER, DETECTIVE, BEVERLY HILLS POLICE
DEPARTMENT (310) 285-2145, PROVIDED PART OF THE
INFORMATION FOR THE PRESENT OFFENSE SECTION OF
THIS REPORT. HE ADDED THAT THE DEFENDANTS LIED TO
THEM FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. THE VICTIMS' BODY
TISSUE AND BLOOD WERE ALL OVER THE WALLS AND
CEILING. DR. OZIEL TESTIFIED THAT CERTAIN REMARKS
WERE MADE BY THE DEFENDANTS.

HE BELIEVES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS
SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING THE
DEFENDANTS TOGETHER IN PRISON.

ATTACHED ARE NUMEROUS LETTERS FROM RELATIVES,
FRIENDS AND FORMER JURORS OF THE DEFENDANTS.
THEY SPEAK OVERWHELMINGLY IN SUPPORT OF THE
DEFENDANTS AND REQUEST THAT THE DEFENDANTS BE
ALLOWED TO SERVE THEIR PRISON TERMS TOGETHER IN
THE SAME INSTITUTION. INCLUDED ARE LETTERS FROM
THE FOLLOWING:

FR. KEN DEASY, PASTOR OF ST. AGATHA CATHOLIC
CHURCH IN LOS ANGELES WHO COUNSELED BRIEFLY
WITH THE DEFENDANTS BEFORE THE
MURDERS AND EXTENSIVELY SINCE.

ANDREA CAPLAN OF LOS ANGELES, A FRIEND OF LYLE.

ANNA ERIKSSON OF LOS ANGELES, LYLE'S FIANCEE.

TRACY A. MILLER OF BURBANK, A JUROR IN THE
DEFENDANT'S FIRST TRIAL.

SANDRA ROBINSON SHARP OF LAWRENCEVILLE, NEW
JERSEY, A FORMER HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER OF BOTH
LYLE AND ERIK.

BETTY BURKE OF CANYON COUNTRY, AN ALTERNATE
JUROR IN DEFENDANT'S FIRST TRIAL.

THE CO-DEFENDANT'S FIRST TRIAL.

DR. BARBARA ZUSSMAN OF STUDIO CITY WHO WAS
ERIK'S ENGLISH TEACHER AT BEVERLY HILL HIGH
SCHOOL.

JUDY GOLDSTEIN, MOTION PICTURE PRODUCER AT
APPLEDOWN FILMS IN BEVERLY HILLS.

ANN H. TYLER, Ph.D., LICENSED PSYCHOLOGIST,
WRITES, "...I HAVE A LOT OF CONCERN REGARDING THE
KIND OF PRISON THEY WILL BE SENT TO... SURELY ERIC
(SIC) CAN BE SENT TO A PRISON THAT WILL ENABLE HIM
TO LIVE SAFELY WITHOUT FEAR OF AGAIN BEING
SEXUALLY AND     PHYSICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY
ABUSED... NOT MANY PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT
PATRICIDE IS A CRIME THAT REALLY CAN NOT BE
COMPARED TO ANY OTHER VIOLENT ACTS... ERIC'S
PERCEPTION OF HIS FATHER AND MOTHER WAS THAT
THEY WERE BIGGER THAN LIFE AND MORE POWERFUL
THAN ANY HIGHER POWER..."

JOHN P. WILSON, Ph.D., CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST IN
CLEVELAND HEIGHTS, OHIO, AND DIRECTOR OF THE
CENTER FOR STRESS AND TRAUMA, WRITES, "...ERIK
HAS BEGUN TO DEVELOP INSIGHT AND
UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HIS PSYCHOPATHOLOGY. HE
HAS RESPONDED WELL TO ANTI-DEPRESSANT
MEDICATION AND HAS GOOD VERBAL SKILLS FOR
PSYCHOTHERAPY. NEVERTHELESS, HE CLEARLY IS IN
NEED OF FURTHER TREATMENT AT THIS TIME. HE IS NOT
PRONE TO VIOLENCE AND GENERALLY TRIES TO OVER-
CONTROL HIS EMOTIONS AND- SYMPTOMS. I BELIEVE
THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH
HIS BROTHER LYLE WOULD BE
BENEFICIAL TO HIS MENTAL HEALTH..."

DENZIL J. KLIPPEL, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF INVESTOR
SERVICES CONSULTING GROUP IN STATEN ISLAND, NEW
YORK.

ANN WOLBERT BURGESS OF WEST NEWTON,
MASSACHUSETTS, A  PSYCHIATRIC NURSE.

MARY V. WILLIAMS OF OXNARD, CALIFORNIA, FORMER
HEAD OF PRINCETON DAY SCHOOL IN PRINCETON, NEW
JERSEY.

NORMAN PULS OF WOODLAND HILLS, A FORMER MATH
AND SCIENCE TUTOR FOR ERIK.

FAITH GOLDSMITH OF FREEHOLD, NEW JERSEY.

STEPHEN B. GOLDBERG, ATTORNEY IN REDONDO BEACH
WHO HANDLED THE PROBATE OF THE VICTIM'S ESTATE,
WRITES, "...IN DISCUSSING THE EVENTS THAT
ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN THE KILLING OF HIS
PARENTS,  I SAW IN ERIK NOTHING BUT PAIN, REMORSE
AND SHAME FOR WHAT  HE HAD DONE... WHILE I
CONDEMN WHAT THEY HAVE DONE, I DO NOT BELIEVE
THAT LWOP IS TOO LENIENT A SENTENCE, SUCH THAT IT
NEEDS TO BE IMPOSED IN THE MOST PAINFUL WAY
AVAILABLE..." REGARDING LYLE, HE WRITES, "...HE HAS
A WAY OF PUTTING PEOPLE AT EASE, EVEN IN WHAT
MIGHT OTHERWISE BE CONFRONTIVE SITUATIONS. HE IS
FUNNY WITHOUT BEING MEAN, AND IS WILLING TO
LAUGH AT HIMSELF. WITH HIS  STRONG BUT PLEASANT
PERSONALITY, COMBINED WITH HIS INTELLIGENCE, HE
HAS THE ABILITY TO HELP OTHERS ACCOMPLISH THEIR
GOALS. PROPERLY PLACED, THIS STRENGTH SHOULD
ALLOW HIM TO BE AN ASSET IN THE RIGHT
INSTITUTION... THE DECISION AS TO WHERE LYLE WILL
SERVE HIS
SENTENCE, BOTH AS TO THE CHOICE OF FACILITY, AND
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT LYLE AND ERIK WILL BE
TOGETHER, IS CRITICAL... PLACED TOGETHER,  I BELIEVE
THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE THE HEALING PROCESS THAT
EACH HAS BEGUN..."

HARRY HADERIS, II, OF BEVERLY HILLS.

ANDREW PIERCE, ATTORNEY IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA.

WILLIAM VICARY, J.D., M.D., FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIST IN
LOS ANGELES, WHO HAS BEEN TREATING ERIK IN JAIL
SINCE JUNE, 1990, WRITES THAT ERIK WAS INITIALLY SO
DEPRESSED THAT HE HAD  PSYCHOTIC-LIKE SYMPTOMS
AND HAD TO BE TREATED WITH LARGE DOSES OF
TRANQUILIZING AND ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATIONS.
HOWEVER, HIS SYMPTOMS SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED
AND HIS MENTAL CONDITION IS NOW RELATIVELY
STABLE. BUT HE CONTINUES TO SUFFER FROM
MODERATE DEPRESSION AND IS BEING TREATED WITH
150 mg. OF PAMELOR DAILY. HE ALSO RECEIVES INDERAL
AND XANEX FOR ANXIETY.

STUART N. HART, Ph.D., PSYCHOLOGIST, IS PROFESSOR
OF COUNSELING AND EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY AT
INDIANA UNIVERSITY AND PURDUE UNIVERSITY IN
INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA, ALSO IN PRIVATE PRACTICE,
SPECIALIZING IN CHILD AND ADOLESCENT
DEVELOPMENT AND PARTICULARLY IN PSYCHOLOGICAL
EXPERIENCES AND THEIR IMPACT, WRITES, "IT IS MY
PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT THAT (A) ERIK AND LYLE
WORKED HARD THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES TO PLEASE
THEIR PARENTS AND MEET THEIR  EXTREMELY
DEMANDING REQUIREMENTS; AND (B) THEY WERE
SEVERELY PSYCHOLOGICALLY MALTREATED
THROUGHOUT MOST OF THEIR LIVES AND, AS A RESULT,
WHEN THEY KILLED THEIR PARENTS THEY WERE
IMMATURE, FEARFUL, DEPENDENT, BELIEVED
THEMSELVES ISOLATED FROM HELP, AND THEY WERE
SERIOUSLY LIMITED IN THEIR ABILITY TO DEAL WITH
PERCEIVED THREATS  AND SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THEY
FACED. MY STUDY OF THEIR LIVES DID NOT SUPPORT
THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY KILLED THEIR PARENTS
BECAUSE OF GREED OR HATE... I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT
LYLE OR ERIK REPRESENT A DANGER TO ANYONE BUT,
RATHER, THAT THEY EACH COULD BE ENDANGERED BY
PLACEMENT IN THE PROXIMITY OF VIOLENT
CRIMINALS... THE NOTORIETY THEY HAVE RECEIVED,
THEIR YOUTHFUL GOOD LOOKS, MISIMPRESSIONS THAT
THEY WERE SPOILED BRATS, AND PUBLIC EXPOSURE OF
ALLEGATIONS THAT THEY WERE SEXUALLY ABUSED
WILL MAKE THEM PRIME TARGETS FOR PHYSICAL
AGGRESSION, CRUELTY, AND SEXUAL ATTACK FROM
PRISON INMATES ... OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, THE
VAST MAJORITY OF THE DEFENDANTS' EXTENDED
FAMILY, "HAVE RALLIED AROUND THEM PROVIDING
ESSENTIAL SUPPORT AND MEANING IN THEIR LIVES..."
DR. HART HAS ALREADY SET IN MOTION STEPS BY
WHICH THE DEFENDANTS MAY ENROLL IN INDIANA
UNIVERSITY'S CORRESPONDENCE PROGRAMS. HE WILL
HELP THEM, "... DEVELOP COMPETENCIES AND
INTERESTS IN WAYS WHICH WILL HELP THEM REDEEM
THEMSELVES AND SERVE OTHERS. I STRONGLY
RECOMMEND THAT LYLE AND ERIK BE PLACED IN THE
SAME INSTITUTION AND THAT IT BE ONE WHICH WILL
PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THEIR THERAPEUTIC AND
EDUCATIONAL NEED, AND FOR THEIR DESIRE TO BE OF
USE TO OTHERS..."

JANET S. STOLTZFUS OF PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY, A
FORMER SCHOOL TEACHER OF ERIK AT PRINCETON DAY
SCHOOL.

ANAMARIA BARALT OF MIAMI BEACH, FLORIDA, THE
DEFENDANT'S COUSIN, WRITES THAT THE DEFENDANTS
ARE TWO OF THE MOST GIFTED PEOPLE SHE HAS EVER
KNOWN. "...THEY HAVE SO MUCH TO OFFER TO     THE
WORLD, IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO SEE IT GO WASTED..."
LYLE WAS DEPICTED AS A "HEARTLESS, CRUEL TYRANT,"
A "MONSTER." HOWEVER, HE IS, "...THE MOST LOYAL
PERSON I'VE EVER MET... SENSITIVE TO A FLAW... HE IS
KIND AND GENEROUS... I NEVER FELT SAFER THAN
WHEN I WAS WITH LYLE BECAUSE I KNEW HE WOULD DO
ANYTHING TO PROTECT ME, OR  ANYONE ELSE THAT HE
LOVED... BUT LYLE'S STRONGEST TIE IS WITH HIS
BROTHER, ERIK, FOR WHOM HE WOULD DO ANYTHING..."
THEIR MOST OUTSTANDING TRAIT IS "THEIR FIERCE
ATTACHMENT AND LOYALTY TO EACH OTHER. THEY'RE
MORE THAN JUST BROTHERS, THEY'RE BEST FRIENDS.
THEY NEED EACH OTHER IN SO MANY WAYS, THEY
ALWAYS HAVE. I HOPE YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THEIR
NEED TO BE TOGETHER. EQUALLY IMPRESSIVE IS THE
SUPPORT THEY'VE RECEIVED FROM OUR FAMILY AND
WILL CONTINUE TO IN THE FUTURE. PLEASE TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION THE REST OF US AS THEIR  FAMILY AND
OUR NEEDS TO HAVE THEM IN THE SAME PLACE TO VISIT.
THE FAMILY HASN'T CUT THEM OFF BECAUSE OF WHAT
HAS HAPPENED... MANY OF US WILL WANT TO VISIT
THEM IN THE FUTURE, BUT SINCE ALMOST EVERYONE IN
THE FAMILY LIVES OUTSIDE OF THE STATE OF
CALIFORNIA, IT IS IMPORTANT TO US THAT THEY (BE)
CLOSE TOGETHER..."

JOHN C. BURNETT OF PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY, A
FORMER CLASSMATE AND "BEST FRIEND" OF ERIK
WRITES THAT ERIK, "...HAS NEVER COME ACROSS TO ME
(AS) A 'SPOILED BRAT' AS THE MEDIA WOULD HAVE (HIM)
PORTRAYED AS, BUT RATHER A MAN WITH A BIG HEART
WHO'S (SIC) BIGGEST FAULT WAS THAT HE FELT THAT
HE COULD NEVER LIVE UP TO THE EXPECTATIONS THAT
WERE PLACED UPON HIM FROM THE TIME HE WAS
BORN."

JOAN VANDER MOLEN OF PAYSON, ARIZONA, THE
DEFENDANT'S MATERNAL AUNT WRITES THAT SHE IS
CONCERNED FOR THE SAFETY OF HER NEPHEWS. "...
THEY ARE WORTHWHILE PEOPLE WHO, IF ALLOWED,
WILL MAKE A CONTRIBUTION WITH THEIR LIVES. THEY
ARE NOT THE MEAN-SPIRITED YOUNG MEN THEY HAVE
BEEN PORTRAYED TO BE AND IN SPITE OF THEIR SIX
YEARS OF INCARCERATION, ARE STILL NAIVE ABOUT THE
WORLD THEY ARE ABOUT TO ENTER."

ADDITIONAL LETTERS MAY BE ATTACHED THAT WERE
RECEIVED AFTER THE PREPARATION OF THIS REPORT. IN
ADDITION, PERSONAL CONTACT WAS MADE WITH THE
FOLLOWING PEOPLE.

JUDY GOLDSTEIN, FILM PRODUCER AT APPLEDOWN
FILMS IN BEVERLY HILLS, STATES SHE HAS KNOWN THE
DEFENDANTS FOR THE LAST TWO AND ONE-HALF YEARS,
BUT HAS PRIMARILY BEEN INVOLVED WITH LYLE. SHE
HOPES THEY ARE KEPT TOGETHER IN PRISON. THEY
HAVE AN INCREDIBLE BOND AND THEY FEAR BEING
SEPARATED. "I HAVE A GREAT CONCERN FOR THEM
GOING INTO THE PRISON SYSTEM. THESE ARE NORMAL,
SOFT GUYS ... I WONDER HOW THEY WILL COPE WHEN
THEY COME UP AGAINST SOME OF THOSE  GUYS (IN
PRISON)... THEY HAVE NO CAPACITY TOWARD
VIOLENCE... (THE PRESENT OFFENSE) IS BEYOND
TRAGIC."

TERESITA (TERRY) BARALT, THE DEFENDANT'S
PATERNAL AUNT, IN PRINCETON JUNCTION, NEW
JERSEY, STATES, "I'M DEVASTATED BY WHAT HAS
HAPPENED... IT WAS A TRAGEDY..." THE DEFENDANTS
ARE NOT BAD KIDS. "IT WAS A HORRENDOUS MOMENT AT
A HORRENDOUS TIME IN THEIR LIVES." THE WORLD SEES
THEM AS CRIMINALS, BUT SHE HAS SEEN THEM BOTH
COME A LONG WAY. ERIK HAS BECOME A GREAT HUMAN
BEING WITH A LOT TO OFFER THE WORLD. PLEASE DO
NOT SEPARATE THEM. THEY ARE ALL THEY HAVE LEFT.
THEY ARE NOT A MENACE TO SOCIETY.

MARIA MENENDEZ, THE DEFENDANT'S PATERNAL
GRANDMOTHER, STATES THE DEFENDANTS WERE VERY
NICE CHILDREN. SHE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT
HAPPENED.

MARTA MENENDEZ-CANO, THE DEFENDANT'S PATERNAL
AUNT IN NORTH PALM BEACH, FLORIDA, STATES SHE
HAS GRADUALLY COME TO REALIZE THE LYING AND
DECEIT THAT WAS FOSTERED BY THE VICTIMS IN THEIR
FAMILY. THE DEFENDANTS FEARED THEIR FATHER.
WHEN ERIK WAS 12, HE WAS BEATEN BY HIS FATHER
FOR SUSPICION OF TELLING LYLE ABOUT THE SEXUAL
ABUSE THAT WAS GOING ON BETWEEN HIM AND HIS
FATHER. THE SECRECY THAT IS TYPICAL IN SEXUAL
ABUSE CASES WAS EVIDENCED BY THE  ANGER JOSE
WOULD SHOW IF ANYONE CAME TO THEIR HOUSE
UNEXPECTEDLY. ERIK WAS NOT ALLOWED TO CALL, OR
RECEIVE CALLS FROM HIS COUSIN, ANDY (HER SON).
WHEN LYLE WAS 17, HE WAS ALLOWED TO LIVE IN A
COTTAGE AT THE REAR OF THE FAMILY'S PROPERTY IN
PRINCETON. AT THE TIME, MARTA THOUGHT THIS WAS
UNSAFE AND UNWISE FOR LYLE. HOWEVER, SHE NOW
BELIEVES THIS WAS DONE SO LYLE COULD NOT SEE OR
HEAR WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE BETWEEN ERIK AND
THEIR FATHER. IF ERIK GOT SICK AT SCHOOL, HE WOULD
BEG HIS TEACHERS NOT TO CALL HIS PARENTS. IF HE
STAYED HOME SICK, HIS MOTHER WOULD PUT HIM IN
THE CLOSET AND MAKE HIM STAY THERE FROM 8:00 A.M.
TO 3:00 P.M. HE WOULD BE PUNISHED GREATER IF HE
CAME OUT OF THE CLOSET WITHOUT PERMISSION. ANDY
IS THE ONLY ONE WHO KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO
ERIK. ONE TIME, JOSE SAT ERIK AND ANDY DOWN IN THE
DEN TO SHOW THEM AN "EDUCATIONAL VIDEO. THE
VIDEO TURNED OUT TO BE HARD CORE PORNOGRAPHY.
AFTER THE    MURDERS, THEY FOUND A STACK OF
PORNOGRAPHIC VIDEOS IN THE DEN WHERE THE
MURDERS TOOK PLACE. JOSE WAS A VERY
PSYCHOLOGICALLY STRONG PERSON. THERE IS NO WAY
THE DEFENDANTS COULD RUN AWAY FROM HIM. HE WAS
SICK. "KITTY" ALSO HAD A NEUROTIC PERSONALITY.
YOU NEVER KNEW  WHAT TO EXPECT FROM HER. SHE
ATTEMPTED SUICIDE TWICE, BUT NO ONE ELSE KNEW
ABOUT IT. ALSO, NO ONE KNEW JOSE HAD A GIRLFRIEND
FOR SIX YEARS. THE FAMILY HAD EVERYTHING, BUT
THEY WERE ALWAYS SO SAD ERIK TOLD HER THAT
COUNTY JAIL IS BETTER THAN IT WAS IN HIS HOME. HE
SAID ANDY WAS LUCKY BECAUSE HE HAD A LOCK ON
HIS BEDROOM DOOR. SHE BELIEVES JOSE COULD NOT
STOP WHAT HE WAS DOING TO ERIK EVEN THOUGH HE
KNEW HE WAS DESTROYING THE FAMILY.
NEVERTHELESS, WHAT THE DEFENDANTS DID WAS
WRONG. THEY DESERVE TO BE PUNISHED, BUT NOT
WITH LIFE IN PRISON. TWENTY YEARS ON A
MANSLAUGHTER CONVICTION WOULD BE MORE
APPROPRIATE. NO ONE CAN EVER PUNISH THEM FOR
WHAT THEY HAVE INSIDE. THEY SHOULD ALSO HAVE
MANDATORY PSYCHOTHERAPY. HOWEVER, THEY ARE
NOT A MENACE TO SOCIETY AND THEY NEED TO BE KEPT
TOGETHER.

DIANE VANDER MOLEN, THE DEFENDANTS COUSIN IN
MESA, ARIZONA, STATES HER AUNT "KITTY" WAS HER
MENTOR IN LIFE. "I ADORED HER." HOWEVER, DIANE
NOTICED A HUGE CHANGE IN KITTY'S BEHAVIOR.
WHEN ERIK WAS ABOUT ELEVEN YEARS OLD, SHE SAW
HIM SOBBING ABOUT SOMETHING. WHEN SHE WENT TO
COMFORT HIM, KITTY PHYSICALLY STOPPED HER AND
SAID, "WE DON'T HUG ERIK ANYMORE." WHAT ERIK AND
LYLE DID     WAS WRONG, BUT KNOWING WHAT THE
VICTIMS WERE LIKE, SHE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THIS
COULD HAPPEN. THE DEFENDANTS HAD AN
OVERWHELMING DESIRE TO BE ACCEPTED BY THEIR
PARENTS. BUT DIANE NEVER HEARD JOSE AND KITTY
EXPRESS LOVE TO THEM. IN FACT, KITTY TOLD HER,
"YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE KIDS. THEY ONLY DRIVE A
WEDGE BETWEEN A MAN AND HIS WIFE."

LESLIE H. ABRAMSON, THE DEFENDANT'S ATTORNEY,
WRITES IN THE ATTACHED LETTER THAT THE
DEFENDANT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED A MODEL INMATE IN
JAIL BY THE DEPUTY SHERIFFS WHO HAVE BEEN
INVOLVED WITH HIM. "ERIK HAS THE KIND OF
PERSONALITY AND ATTITUDE THAT GUARANTEES HIS
COOPERATION AND COMPLIANCE WITH DIRECTIONS...
LYLE AND ERIK ARE EXTREMELY CLOSE AND
SUPPORTIVE OF EACH OTHER... GIVEN THEIR LIFE TERMS
WITHOUT POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE IT WOULD BE
UNNECESSARILY CRUEL TO SEPARATE THEM NOW.
MOREOVER, KEEPING THEM TOGETHER WOULD PROVIDE
THE BEST PROTECTION FOR EACH OF THEM ... OUR
SECOND CONCERN IS THAT THEY BE SAFE FROM ATTACK
BY OTHER INMATES..."  SHE WRITES THAT THE REPORTS
OF THEIR BEING MOLESTED BY THEIR FATHER AND THE
UNTRUE REPORTS THAT THE DEFENDANT IS A
HOMOSEXUAL MAKE THEM LIKELY TARGETS FOR
ASSAULT IN PRISON. THIRDLY, SHE REQUESTS THAT THE
DEFENDANT CONTINUE TO RECEIVE PSYCHIATRIC
TREATMENT FOR POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER
AND DEPRESSION AS HE HAS FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS.
FOURTHLY, SHE REQUESTS THAT THE DEFENDANTS,
"...BE CONFINED IN AN INSTITUTION THAT WILL ALLOW
THEM TO PURSUE THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS... ERIK
HAS INDICATED HIS INTEREST IN OBTAINING A Ph.D. IN
PSYCHOLOGY... THEIR SIX YEAR INCARCERATION HAS
BEEN TOUGH AND THEIR SENTENCE TOTALLY
DISPROPORTIONATE TO THEIR TRUE CULPABILITY. THEY,
HOWEVER, ARE NOT TOUGH AT ALL. NOR ARE THEY
BITTER OR DEFEATED. THEIR DESIRE IS TO FIND A WAY
TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL LIFE IN SPITE OF
EVERYTHING... THE MENENDEZ BROTHERS ARE THE
LEAST DANGEROUS, THE LEAST ASOCIAL, THE LEAST
MEAN SPIRITED, THE LEAST NARCISSISTIC AND THE
MOST TALENTED AND PROMISING OF VIRTUALLY ALL MY
OTHER CLIENTS...ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE FOR
THEM THAT WILL LESSEN TO ANY DEGREE THE LIFETIME
OF SUFFERING THAT THEY MUST ENDURE WILL BE A
BLESSING."


BRIAN ANDERSEN, DEFENDANT'S MATERNAL UNCLE, IN
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, STATES THE DEFENDANTS WERE
MOVING TOWARD A LIFE OF CRIME ANYWAY, BOTH IN
SCHOOL AND THE COMMUNITY. THEY WERE IN A
BURGLARY RING IN CALABASAS AND WERE "ROBBING"
HOMES. THE STORY OF THE MOLESTATIONS WAS
ABSOLUTELY MADE UP. THE STORY OF PARENTAL ABUSE
WAS CONJURED UP. "I VIEW THE ABUSE DEFENSE
AS ONE OF THE BIGGEST LIES TO BE TOLD TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE... THE DEFENDANTS WERE BROUGHT
UP BY THEIR FATHER TO WORK WITHIN AND
WITHOUT THE "SYSTEM" AS LONG AS IT SERVED THEIR
PURPOSES. HE THINKS THAT JOSE INTENDED TO
DEMONSTRATE AN AGGRESSIVE APPROACH TO THE
SYSTEM. HOWEVER, LYLE INTERPRETED THIS TO MEAN
THAT LIFE DID NOT HAVE ANY PARAMETERS AT ALL AND
HE DEVELOPED AN SOCIOPATHIC MENTALITY. HE COULD
LIE HIS WAY OUT OF ANY PROBLEM. HE WILL BE A
PROBLEM IN THE PENAL SYSTEM, TESTING LIMITS
WHEREVER HE IS PLACED. ERIK, HOWEVER, DOES NOT
SHARE THE SAME AGGRESSIVE SOCIOPATHIC
MENTALITY. IF HE IS SEPARATED FROM LYLE, HE WILL
FIND A WAY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SOCIETY HE IS IN.
BUT IF THE TWO ARE KEPT  TOGETHER, HE WILL BE
CORRUPTED BY LYLE. MR. ANDERSEN FEELS THE
DEFENDANTS COMMITTED THE PRESENT OFFENSE FOR A
VARIETY OF REASONS. JOSE WAS A DOMINANT FORCE; A
CONTROL FREAK. LYLE WANTED TO DO WHAT HE
WANTED TO DO, BUT JOSE DID EVERYTHING HE COULD
TO INHIBIT LYLE'S EXTRANEOUS ACTIVITY. LYLE
RESENTED THIS AND INTERPRETED THIS CONTROL AS
DEMEANING AND BELITTLING; HIS EGO COULD NOT DEAL
WITH THIS AND HE WANTED TO ELIMINATE JOSE'S
CONTROL OVER HIS LIFE. KITTY, MR. ANDERSEN'S
SISTER, WAS MUCH EASIER TO MANEUVER AROUND.
HOWEVER, HER AGREEMENT WITH JOSE'S PRINCIPLES
WAS A PROBLEM TO THE   DEFENDANTS. THEY HAD TO
ELIMINATE JOSE'S CONTROL OVER THEM. BUT  TO BE
FINANCIALLY FREE, KITTY ALSO HAD TO BE ELIMINATED.
HER DEATH WAS ONLY FOR GREED - TO INHERIT ALL THE
MONEY.

EVALUATION:

THE PRESENT OFFENSE APPEARS TO BE THE
DEFENDANT'S ONLY INVOLVEMENT IN ANY AGGRESSIVE
OR VIOLENT BEHAVIOR. HE FULLY ADMITS HIS
PARTICIPATION IN THIS MATTER AND STATES HE
REALIZES WHAT A TERRIBLE MISTAKE HE MADE AND
REGRETS WHAT HE DID. MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT
HIS AFFLUENT LIFESTYLE AND THE ABUSE HE RECEIVED
FROM HIS FATHER. THEORIES HAVE BEEN MADE OF HIS
THIRST FOR MONEY AND HIS EXTRAVAGANT LIFESTYLE
IN THE SIX MONTHS BETWEEN THE MURDERS AND HIS
ARREST. IT IS CLEAR THAT HE COMMITTED A
HORRENDOUS ACT OF VIOLENCE AGAINST THE PEOPLE
TO WHOM HE OWED HIS LIFE AND HIS LIFESTYLE.
HOWEVER, TO THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW AND LOVE HIM
MOST, IT WAS A HORRENDOUS TIME OF HIS LIFE. HE WAS
AN INTELLIGENT, TALENTED AND HEALTHY YOUNG
MAN, BUT HE WAS KEPT UNDER CLOSE WRAPS BY HIS
PARENTS WHO APPARENTLY DID NOT TRUST HIM. HIS
MOTHER REPORTEDLY TAPE RECORDED HIS TELEPHONE
CALLS AND HIS FATHER KEPT PORNOGRAPHIC VIDEOS IN
THE FAMILY DEN WHICH HE USED TO "EDUCATE" HIS
CHILDREN AND OTHERS. CERTAINLY, NONE OF THE
ABOVE, EVEN THE ALLEGED SEXUAL ABUSE, IS WORTHY
OF DEATH. HOWEVER, SOMETHING CONVINCED THIS
MAN, WHO WAS JUST ENTERING MANHOOD, THAT SUCH
VIOLENCE WAS NECESSARY. SINCE THE INCIDENT, THE
PSYCHOLOGICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND PHYSICAL
PRESSURE AFFECTED HIM SO GREATLY THAT HE SOUGHT
HELP BY CONFIDING IN SEVERAL FRIENDS AND A
PSYCHIATRIST. THIS, THEN, LED TO HIS ARREST, WHICH
HE STATES WAS A RELIEF. THE SIX YEARS THAT HAVE
FOLLOWED HAVE BEEN FILLED WITH PSYCHIATRIC AND
SPIRITUAL COUNSELING, ESTABLISHING NEW, AND
MAINTAINING ESTABLISHED FRIENDSHIPS, AND, MORE
IMPORTANTLY,
THE LOVE AND ACCEPTANCE OF MANY OF HIS RELATIVES
WHO WERE ALSO EFFECTED AND HURT GREATLY BY
WHAT HE DID. HE IS NOW FACING A LIFE OF
IMPRISONMENT, AND RIGHTLY SO. IT IS SUGGESTED,
HOWEVER, THAT THE COURT AND DEPARTMENT OF
CORRECTIONS GIVE CONSIDERATION TO PLACING HIM IN
AN INSTITUTION THAT WILL ALLOW HIM TO REMAIN
CLOSE TO HIS BROTHER, NOT ONLY FOR HIS SAKE BUT
FOR RELATIVES, TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FURTHERANCE
OF HIS EDUCATIONAL GOALS AND TO CONTINUE HIS
THERAPY. THIS YOUNG MAN HAS GROWN AND MATURED
IN THE LAST SIX-PLUS YEARS. HE IS NOT CONSIDERED A
THREAT TO HIMSELF OR OTHERS, AND IS EXPECTED TO
BECOME AN ASSET TO ANY INSTITUTION IN WHICH HE IS
PLACED.

SENTENCING CONSIDERATIONS:

THE DEFENDANT IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR PROBATION
PURSUANT TO 1203.075(A)(1) PC.

AGGRAVATING FACTORS:
NONE.

MITIGATING FACTORS:
NONE.

FURTHERMORE, THE DEFENDANT IS INELIGIBLE FOR

<h2>A Chat with a Menendez Juror</h2>

<P>Lesley Hillings, a juror in the second Menendez murder trial, and reporter Mary Jane Stevenson appeared on America Online's Center Stage April 22, 1996 for a live chat. The following is a transcript.</P>
<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>Court TV:</B> Hello everybody. Our guests tonight are Lesley Hillings, a juror in the Menendez trial, and Court TV reporter Mary Jane Stevenson. I'd like to ask our guests, what has it been like for you, since the trial ended?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> It has been quite a whirlwind with the media and all. It's kind of been like a therapy for us jurors to be able to talk about this entire case. I think a way for us to relieve the tensions or stress of the trial is to talk about it now.</P>

<P><B>Mary Jane Stevenson:</B> At first it felt like the story wasn't over because I was chasing down jurors. But now it seems finally to be past me and hopefully I can go on vacation.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What did you folks think of David Conn's demeanor in court?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> I thought he was an excellent lawyer and presented his case in a very well organized manner. Sometimes he would go overboard on a point or really badger the witness with repeated questions on the same exact point.</P>

<P><B>Mary Jane Stevenson:</B> I thought he showed a lot of class when he discovered the incident between Dr. Vicary and Leslie Abramson. Although they are adversaries and he knew that she might have been in a lot of trouble, he basically sat back and let the judge work it out. He did not spew a lot of rhetoric and accuse her of misconduct.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Can you please tell us the reasons why the jurors did not believe the sexual abuse?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> Because there were inconsistencies in Eric's story it left doubt in jurors' minds. Also, some jurors felt that either one of the brothers could have left the home at any point and chose not to. Some felt Jose Menendez did not seem the type of person that would do that. And I should add that some jurors did feel there was sexual abuse.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Did the jury ever consider second-degree murder convictions, and if not, why not?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> The jury never discussed degrees of murder. We just went over all of the elements individually and found each of them to be true. When we had finished, we had all the elements of first-degree murder and therefore we never discussed the degrees individually.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Based on what evidence did the jury conclude that Lyle and Erik purchased the guns with the intent to kill -- rather for self protection?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> Because of the tape that was made by their psychologist Dr. Oziel. There was evidence of premeditation on that tape. Also, we did not believe that they actually feared for their lives at any time. We did feel they feared their parents --but not for their lives.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Do you think the jury, as a whole, connected with Carol Najera? Was she overbearing at times as assistant prosecutor?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> No, Ms. Najera was not overbearing. She actually was very soft spoken and her role was much less than that of David Conn who did most of the witness examination.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Are you aware, and are other jurors aware, that the judge gutted the defense on the very last day of testimony in the penalty phase, just before closing arguments? By this I mean that the judge ruled that the defense couldn't argue its imperfect self-defense theory.</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> No, the jury was not aware at that time because we were not allowed to read or watch any media coverage of the trial or discuss it with anyone. However, I do feel we considered self- defense during our deliberation and felt that neither defendant was acting in self-defense at the time they committed the killings.</P>

<P><B>Mary Jane Stevenson:</B> It sounds to me as if the imperfect self defense instruction would not have made a difference in deliberation. However, let me pose this question to Lesley: Would it have made a difference if you were allowed to consider that the brothers believed they were in danger even though they truly weren't -- that because of their background they mistakenly believed there was a danger there that wasn't. That is the difference between imperfect self-defense and regular self defense.</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> We did discuss whether they felt they were in danger and their state of mind while the crime was being committed. But we did not believe they were in fear at that time and that they were not acting in self defense.</P>

<P><B>Mary Jane Stevenson:</B> So it sounds as if the judge's ruling had absolutely no bearing on the outcome of this case. Because what Lesley is saying is that although they were not instructed to consider imperfect self defense, they did so anyway.</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> We were not instructed not to consider it.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What were the inconsistencies in Erik's testimony about sexual abuse?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> Most of the inconsistencies that we found in Erik's testimony were not related to sexual abuse -- because no one witnessed the sexual abuse. However, we felt some of the testimony that Erik gave could not have occurred as he stated it without other people knowing about it because at various times cousins lived with them in the home for long periods.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What was your impression of Roger McCarthy and his reconstruction of the crime scene?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> Personally I thought Roger McCarthy was a very nice man and a very credible witness. I give him a lot of credit for trying to reconstruct the crime scene because in my mind I kept wondering how the shooting occurred. His reconstruction gave me an idea of how it could have occurred. Then there were many experts brought in to refute the testimony and we listened to testimony on the reconstruction for about a month where they were arguing over minor details such as an angle of a shot or the exact order of the shots. During deliberation, we talked about the crime scene reconstruction for about five minutes, and felt it was irrelevant as to how the shots exactly occurred.</P>

<P><B>Mary Jane Stevenson:</B> Amazing that so much time was spent on something that the jurors spent so little time considering. I felt from listening to the witnesses that that crime scene could not be reconstructed by anyone. And I wonder whether the prosecutors could have shaved off a month of this trial by eliminating Dr. McCarthy.</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> The jurors felt that the reason the crime scene was played out for such a long period of time by the prosecution was to focus on the brutality of the crime. It allowed the prosecutors to show us photos and exhibits over and over again.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Was there one particular thing that made the jury vote for life in prison instead of death?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> No, there was not one particular thing. The judge's instructions were very limiting as to what we could consider to be an aggravating factor. An aggravating factor is something you consider in favor of the death penalty. There were many factors that you could consider as mitigating. To rule for a death penalty verdict, the aggravating factors had to substantially outweigh the mitigating factors.</P>

<P><B>Mary Jane Stevenson:</B> It seems as if Lyle Menendez barely squeaked by with a life sentence because from what I've heard from the jurors, juror Bruce Seitz gave a speech to the jury about why Lyle should get life and not death. Bruce replaced another juror who had a heart attack during the first deliberations. This juror tells me she most likely would have voted for death. So had she not had her heart attack, it seems Lyle Menendez most likely would have gotten the death penalty.</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> Lyle was definitely closer to getting the death penalty than Erik and many jurors made speeches such as Bruce Seitz, both in favor of Lyle and against him. After the case, when I spoke with the juror who had the heart attack, we discussed the death penalty. I explained to her some of the judge's instructions and what we could and could not consider, and she then questioned whether or not she too would have been able to vote for the death penalty under those circumstances.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What did the jury think about the written play by play as to how the brothers were going to carry out the crime. I had heard some years back that there were written plans. Was that brought out in the second trial?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> No, there was no evidence of any written plans.</P>

<P><B>Mary Jane Stevenson:</B> I've never heard of such a thing. Had there been evidence of written plans, I'm sure that the prosecution would have introduced it, and it was never introduced.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What kind of things did the jurors talk about instead of talking about the trial? Did you talk about pets, families, or chicken coops? What?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> We discussed families and other current events. We did the morning crossword and jumble. We watched dozens of movies, played cards and dominoes, and kept ourselves entertained. We all had a great sense of humor and we used humor to lighten the stress of the case. And since we could not talk about the case, we tried to joke with each other and keep ourselves busy when we were not in court.</P>

<P><B>Mary Jane Stevenson:</B> Did you have a video machine or something in the room where you were staying? That shack that you stayed in?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> Yes, we had a VCR and could watch movies that we all brought in, but we could not watch regular TV because there could be media coverage.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Are you writing a book about your experience as a juror?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> No, I have no plans to write a book at this time.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Did you find the jury instructions confusing?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> No, they were not confusing, but we did have to go over them very carefully -- to making sure we all understood them and that we agreed as to what they meant.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Did the jury know when it convicted Lyle and Erik that the sentence would be death or life w/o parole only?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> Yes. At the beginning of the trial, the judge mentioned that if a verdict of first-degree murder was found, there would be a penalty phase that immediately followed.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Did the fact that Lyle did not testify hurt him and/or Erik?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> I don't think Erik was hurt because Lyle didn't testify. There were many things we did not know about Lyle that we may have been able to learn if he had testified. We only heard information about Lyle from other witnesses and from Erik.</P>

<P><B>Mary Jane Stevenson:</B> Lesley, what did you all think of the video that you watched during the Dateline interview of Lyle Menendez's testimony in the first trial?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> I personally felt that his testimony was very emotional. However, I listened in court to Lyle making a call to 911 reporting the parents' death, and he was crying and highly emotional in that call. I knew that he was lying when he made that call.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Did anyone wonder/doubt why the psychiatrist Dr. Oziel was never called? Did you believe the tape of his session with Erik and Lyle?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> We felt the tape had some truth to it because it was made before their arrest. We all wondered why we did not see Dr. Oziel testify and wish that we could have heard from him.</P>

<P><B>Mary Jane Stevenson:</B> Have you since heard that Dr. Oziel was never called because of credibility problems in the first trial? And if so, would that have made a difference in how you viewed the December 11 tape?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> No, I was not aware of that.</P>

<P><B>Mary Jane Stevenson:</B> Would that have made a difference in how you viewed the tape?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> If he had testified in the second trial, I would have evaluated his credibility based on his testimony at that time because I have no knowledge of his prior testimony.</P>

<P><B>Mary Jane Stevenson:</B> Did the fact that he did not testify make you question the tape at all?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> No, it did not make me question the tape. I figured there was a reason that neither side called him to the stand, but I did not know what the reason was. I thought the prosecution would have called him.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> How could you possibly avoid seeing all of the negative hateful publicity that was anti-Menendez?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> Most times I avoided watching regular TV and just watched cable movies instead. My children would check the morning newspaper and cut out anything related to the case as did the deputies at court when we brought newspapers. I told people I knew that I was on the case and could not discuss it in any way, and they were very understanding.</P>

<P><B>Mary Jane Stevenson:</B> Have you caught up on the coverage since the trial, and if so, did anything surprise you?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> I have not fully caught up on the coverage that took place during the trial. However, from things I've heard on the news or through the media in the last few days, I felt there were some things I would have like to have known during the trial, but I don't think it would have changed my decision.</P>

<P><B>Mary Jane Stevenson:</B> Could you give a couple of examples of things you heard that you would have liked to have known during the trial?</P>

<P><B>Lesley Hillings:</B> Someone told me that Lyle bragged about being able to turn on tears or persuade a jury.</P>

<P><B>Court TV:</B> I want to thank both our guests. We appreciate you guys spending the time with us. Good night all.</P>

<P>On March 27, the first day of the Menendez trial penalty phase, Mary Jane Stevenson appeared on America Online's Globe, a virtual auditorium that allows as many as 5,000 people to participate in a live chat. Though the judge placed a "gag order" on lawyers involved in the case until the end of the penalty phase, Stevenson was in the courtroom and answered the following questions posed by the audience.</P>
<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>CourtTV9:</B> Our guest in the Center Stage tonight is Court TV reporter Mary Jane Stevenson, who has been covering the Menendez trial from the courtroom in Van Nuys. Well, Mary Jane, for those of us who missed your report tonight on Prime Time Justice, what happened in today?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> The lawyers gave short opening statements in the morning. The prosecution said it would not call any witnesses. The defense called Aunt Teresita Baralt, who cried on the witness stand and begged for mercy for Lyle and Erik.</P>

<P><B>CourtTV9:</B> What can you tell us about the prosecution's strategy? Isn't it unusual?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> Yes. Normally, the prosecution begins a penalty phase with its most powerful evidence -- the victims' family and friends describing their loss. But in this case, almost all of the family members have thrown their support behind Lyle and Erik. This is a problem for the prosecution.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> How are Lyle and Erik looking/acting?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> They definitely seem more downtrodden. Erik seems angry. Today in court, their grandmother showed Lyle a picture of him when he was younger and free. Lyle smiled.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Mary Jane, If Lyle testifies in penalty phase could the Tracy Baker letter be used against him?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> I'm not sure because all hearings regarding penalty phase witnesses have been held in secret but Lyle's attorney told me earlier that Lyle most likely will not testify.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Does California require all 12 jurors to vote yes for death penalty?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> Yes, The verdict must be unanimous. If the jury deadlocks, the state will have to decide whether to try the penalty phase again.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> MJ, What was the demeanor of the jury this morning?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> They did not smile, even when Leslie Abramson got personal with them during opening statements. They seemed very solemn.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Mary Jane, How did you get chosen to cover the Menendez trial?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> I think part of it was because I covered the first trial for a legal newspaper in Los Angeles.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Mary Jane, I am curious to know what you think of the verdict?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> I think the interesting point is that this result is so very different than the result in the first trial, and that's because the two trials were so very different.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Did Garcetti win the nomination for DA and did anyone find his partying on the news video upsetting?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> Garcetti has been forced into a runoff in November against one of his deputy district attorneys. Many people, including lawyers, have told me they were offended by the cheering on verdict today.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Is there interaction between Erik and Lyle?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> Yes, often they talk or pass notes. When the lawyers go to a sidebar conference, they sit and chat with each other.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> During your PTJ broadcast last week, it looked like someone in the DA's office said "Let 'em die" or something. True?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> That's what it sounded like on the tape, but it's impossible to tell who said it. I think the quote was "We'll kill them."</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> How do you handle (or feel) about seeing the penalty phase for two people you have known for over four years?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> Good question. It is difficult to watch the family members, especially, plead for the brothers' lives. They have already been through so much.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> MJ, if the jury deadlocks, and the state declines to retry, can the judge give a sentence other than life without parole?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> No.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What is the minimum that the brothers can receive?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> Life without parole. And that means no parole. They will never get out of prison alive.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> MJ, You probably can't wait until this trial is over! Do you have any idea how long the penalty phase is expected to last? Also, what will your next assignment be?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> The penalty phase should last between three to five weeks. I have no idea what I will do next.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Is it true that Lyle and Erik will be sent to different prisons and never allowed to see each other again?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> I don't know. I have asked the attorneys, but they say they don't know. One thing is for sure. Their attorneys will do everything they can to keep the brothers out of the general population.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Does the brother's grandmother still visit both Lyle and Erik regularly?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> Yes. She visits them in jail, and she comes to court everyday without fail.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Is an appeal realistic?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> Many legal experts think a successful appeal is a long shot. Mainly because a higher court would hesitate to overturn these convictions. And send the case back to a third trial. However, some lawyers say Judge Weisberg overstepped his bounds and is likely to be overturned.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What happened to the families properties?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> I believe everything was sold.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> How do the brothers feel about each other? Is there one that blames the other for the responsibility of the killings?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> They have never turned against each other, nor have they ever said, in court, that either one is more responsible than the other. However, Lyle took responsibility for shooting Jose in the back of the head and for reloading and shooting Kitty Menendez at close range in the face.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Do you think that the apparent backlash from the O.J. trial that kept the cameras out of the Menendez trial and others will ever fade, or have we seen the last of high profile cases on TV?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> I hope not. Court TV just got into a trial in Los Angeles which is a race-discrimination case which is against the LAPD. Hopefully, that's the beginning of a trend of the camera being allowed in more courtrooms.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> As for Leslie Abramson, is this the end of her legal career?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> So she says. According to her, Erik is her last client.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Did it seem obvious to you that Judge Weisberg was against the brothers? Isn't he supposed to remain impartial?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> The defense argued that he wanted the brothers convicted. The prosecution says he was completely fair.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Were the brothers able to use their inheritance and life- insurance moneys for legal fees?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> Yes. They used most of it for legal fees.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Why did Domminick Dunne make such a big deal on CNN about no reaction in the Courtroom when he knows very well the judge and bailiffs forbid any reaction?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> I don't know.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Why do you think the jury was as hard on Erik as they were on Lyle?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> I have no idea. I can't wait to talk to the jury about their reasoning on all of this.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Is there going to be an interview show made of all the interviews you've done with the people involved, since we couldn't see them all?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> I will do my best to interview as many people as I can.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Have you ever talked to either Lyle or Erik? Bob Rand?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> Yes, all three. I talk to Bob Rand every day.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Do you think the jury might have second thoughts or doubts when they hear all of the abuse evidence during the penalty phase?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> I don't know. The jury may have rejected all of the abuse evidence already which may be devastating for the defense, if that is true.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Well, if they are sentenced to death, how long will they be on death row?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> For years and years. They will have automatic appeals to the State Supreme Court, and that will take years.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> How is the health of the two dismissed jurors?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> I don't know. I have tried to find out, but I haven't heard anything since I reported that one of them had a heart attack and the other went into premature labor. The court will not release any information about them.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Why do you think the country was so mesmerized by this trial?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> Because it was a family story. It had all the elements of wealth, greed, allegations of sexual molestation, secrecy, murder which makes a very compelling story.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What happened to Dr. Oziel?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> He moved to Arizona, and he did not testify in this trial because the prosecution did not want him to undergo the same blistering cross-examination as he did in the first trial.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What are conditions like in general in the California prisons and on death row?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> I don't know the details. But I can say that Leslie Abramson is extremely worried about Erik joining the prison population.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What do you think of gag orders in these type of cases?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> I think it is too extreme. This is the ultimate action of a state to seek the death penalty, and the attorneys should be able to discuss it publicly. It is a political act, and the people have the right to know how it is being carried out. It should not be carried out in secrecy.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> How did Abramson get along with the lawyers for Lyle?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> Very well. They are all friends and longtime colleagues.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> If they are sentenced to death how long does it take for the deaths to be carried out and are they carried out by lethal injection?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> Yes, they are carried out by lethal injection. It will take years for the brothers to be executed, if they are sentenced to death.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What does "special circumstance" mean?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> There are certain circumstances to murder which the State deems especially heinous. And the special circumstances, in this case, were multiple murder and lying in wait --which means waiting to take the victim by surprise. Those special circumstances are what made the brothers eligible for the death penalty.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What is an average day like for the brothers in prison? Do they have to work? Do they get to watch TV (like Court TV) or have any kind of recreational activity?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> They get to watch TV. They can talk on the phone. Erik has a job. I don't know if Lyle has a job. They read a lot and write a lot of letters.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Is it true that Lyle and Erik are having lots of health problems?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> I have not heard that.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Can there be an appeal if the brothers have no money and what lawyers will handle it?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> Different lawyers will handle the appeals, and they will be paid for by the tax payers' money, because the Menendez brothers are broke.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Why do you think the Menendez Brothers are hated so much?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> I think a lot of it has to do with that they're rich and from Beverly Hills. And they lied about their involvement in these crimes and they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars of their parents' money after killing them.</P>

<P><B>CourtTV9:</B> We're about out of time. Mary Jane, what will we see the rest of this week?</P>

<P><B>StevensnMJ:</B> More family members and friends of the Menendez family pleading for mercy for Lyle and Erik. After that, a parade of coaches and teachers will discuss Jose and Kitty Menendez' parenting techniques.</P>

<P><B>CourtTV9:</B> Thanks a lot for joining us in The Globe. Good night, everybody.</P>

<P>The following is a transcript of reporter Mary Jane Stevenson's March 6 Menendez Trial Verdict Watch. This live chat was held in The Odeon, an America Online Center Stage. More than 120 people attended the event.</P>
<HR WIDTH="525" ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>OnlineHost:</B> Copyright 1996 Court TV; licensed to America Online, Inc.</P>

<P><B>CourtTV9:</B> Mary Jane Stevenson will be here in a few minutes. She will be answering your questions on the Menendez murder trial.</P>

<P><B>OnlineHost:</B> The auditorium consists of two major areas: the audience, where you are right now, and the stage, where the speakers appear. Text which you type onscreen shows only to those in your row, prefaced by the row number in parentheses, such as (2) if you are in row 2. To interact with the speaker, use the Interact icon on your screen.</P>

<P><B>OnlineHost:</B> To send your question to the speaker, click on the Interact icon, then use the Ask a Question option.</P>

<P><B>OnlineHost:</B> MJStevensn has entered the room.</P>

<P><B>CourtTV9:</B> Mary Jane Stevenson has been covering the Menendez trial for Court TV. Today is the third day of deliberations. Mary Jane, what is the latest news?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> The latest news is there is no verdict yet. The jury asked for some testimony to be read back regarding Erik Menendez's testimony, but otherwise, they've been very quiet.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Clearly the Menendez brothers took the lives of their parents. Don't you think it is negligent of the prosecutors to spend so many tax dollars to convict two people who admit guilt and are willing to plea?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> They're willing to plead to manslaughter, and the prosecution thinks it's murder.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> How long is the jury likely to deliberate?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> I have no idea. I cannot tell.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Is it possible that one of the boys will get off and the other will be convicted?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> Yes, that's always been a possibility. But I should point out that getting off will be hard to do because they've admitted it and they most likely will at least be convicted of manslaughter.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> How has this trial differed from the first?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> Mainly the defense has been pared down tremendously. Lyle Menendez, who was the star witness for the defense in the first trial, did not testify in this trial. At least 30 other defense witnesses did not testify, and the main difference is that the judge rejected the defense's theory of imperfect self defense.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What has been the most difficult aspect of covering this trial?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> Having to do my job without using all my tools, namely without a camera.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What happens if there is another hung jury?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> Then the prosecution will have to decide whether to try the case again or to offer the Menendez brothers manslaughter pleas.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Any truth to the rumors that Lyle has been more despondent than Erik this time?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> I don't know what you mean by more despondent. Can you explain? The issue is what crime they should be convicted of. They admitted to the killings, but do not admit that it was murder.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Hi MJ, why was the letter Lyle wrote concerning the handgun issue admitted into evidence and yet the Tracy Baker letter was not, and do you know if T. Baker was going to testify for prosecution?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> The letter about the handgun was admitted because the judge ruled Erik Menendez was aware of it as well, and Erik Menendez testified. But because Lyle Menendez didn't testify the judge ruled the Tracy Baker letter was irrelevant because there was no evidence that Erik knew about it.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Why has the judge imposed a gag order on information?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> He imposed a gag order on information about penalty phase evidence because he does not want the jury to hear anything about the upcoming penalty phase if there will be one.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Do you think the judge will be overturned since he refused to let the jury consider any self defense?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> I have no idea what the court of appeals will do</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What exhibits have the jury asked to see?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> I only know that they've asked to see the transcripts of tape recordings of police interviews with the brothers and of the interview with Lyle and Erik and their therapist, Dr. Oziel.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> How do you view the "groupies" that have supported the brothers. Have there been many this time?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> There are several people who come to court to support the brothers.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> How much money have these trails cost me and other citizens of LA?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> I don't know the exact figure, but taxpayers are paying for four defense attorneys as well as court costs for the five months this second trial has lasted.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Why was this trial not covered on TV to the extent OJ's trial was?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> Because the judge did not allow a camera in the courtroom.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Why can't the D.A.'s just concentrate on the horror of RELOADING the weapon to kill Kitty? Even if they were abused (which is not an excuse), how can anyone find not "the boys" to be not guilty on that action alone?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> The District Attorney did concentrate in his final closing argument on that last shot to Kitty Menendez. He showed a gruesome crime scene photograph and argued over and over again that this was the cruelest part of the killing.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What happens if one of the brothers gets a different sentence than the other brother. Why didn't Najera take a more active role?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> Well then one of them may be walking the streets while the other one sits in jail. She actually questioned a good portion of the witnesses but David Conn was the lead prosecutor and generally the lead prosecutor dominates at least what goes on in the courtroom. She did a lot of behind the scenes work and was very active on this case.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Were there as many female supporters in the courtroom this time around?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> I don't recall exactly how many there were the last time, but there are a handful this time.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What happens if the jury can only come up with a verdict for one brother?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> Then the prosecutors would have to decide how to try the second brother based on what kind of verdict is delivered for the other brother. For instance, if one brother is convicted of first degree murder on both counts, the prosecutor will be more likely to try this case again as a first degree murder. But if one brother gets a manslaughter and an acquittal, the prosecutor may think twice about how to try the other brother a third time.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What's behind the apparent bad blood between Abramson and Judge Weisberg?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> He is making rulings that she believes are unfair. She thinks he has been so unfair that it seems he wants the brothers convicted of first degree murder.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Do you think there are any issues here that amount to reversible error on appeal?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> I don't know, but the defense thinks that the judge has committed reversible error more than once and the defense believes it has a good chance at getting a murder conviction reversed on appeal.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Why didn't the grandmother testify? Is she in court EVERY DAY?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> She is in court every day and I do not know why she didn't testify. The defense never had her on their witness list.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Do you have any observations of the jury? Tears, eyes rolling in disbelief during testimony?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> Actually the jury is complete stone-faced. Neither side has been able to get a chuckle or anything else out of this jury. Some reporters said that they saw one juror shed some tears during Erik Menendez's testimony, but I haven't seen any of the jurors cry myself. They are extremely hard to read.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Can both the brothers receive the death penalty?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> Yes. If they are found guilty of murder with special circumstance, they will have to sit through a penalty phase which is sort of a mini trial during which the same jury will recommend whether they should be sentenced to death or life in prison without the possibility of parole.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> MJ, have you been able to talk to either of the Menendez boys directly?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> I never reveal my sources.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Could you give us a legal definition of manslaughter?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> It is a killing without malice, meaning the killer did not have the state of mind of malice or the intent to kill, but the killing was still unlawful.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> How would you rate the Judge?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> Let's just say I'm not happy that he excluded cameras. Otherwise, I'm paid not to have an opinion.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> If they are convicted will there time already served count?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> Yes. They have been in jail for six years. That will count for about nine years.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> MJ, do the brothers have many family members attending the trial and are they supportive or not?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> Yes, they have aunts, cousins, their grandmother -- and their family members are extremely supportive of the brothers and hope that one day they will get out of jail.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Any idea why the prosecution was so adamant there was no abuse? Why not just say, even if there was, so what? Lots of kids are abused and leave home -- especially if they are adults.</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> The prosecutor's stance is that he does not believe the abuse. He believes this defense was concocted and because he does not believe it, he refuses to concede that it ever happened.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> The 2nd judge has disallowed so much evidence presented during the first trial, not to mention having only one jury. If there is a guilty verdict, will this give the defense team a good argument for appeal?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> This is the same judge as in the first trial. The defense believes it has several good arguments for appeal, but the judge seems confident that all of his rulings will be upheld by any court of appeal.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Does anyone believe that having more men than women will go against the brothers?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> Some people think women are more likely to believe the brothers because in the first trial Erik's jury broke down on gender lines and the women believed the abuse and the men didn't. But it is hard to tell. We'll see what this jury does.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Who do you think was the most powerful defense witness and most powerful prosecution witness?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> Both sides had very many compelling witnesses and that's what makes this case so complicated. It will be interesting to see which witnesses the jurors thought were the most powerful.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Did the defense present as strong a case this time around as in the previous trials?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> The defense was extremely limited by the judge. He cut out about half their witnesses and Lyle Menendez did not testify because of evidence prosecutors have uncovered since the first trial, which was damaging to him. So the defense case did not seem as strong as in the first trial. But the only way to really tell is by waiting to see what the jury does.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What reasons did the judge give for excluding cameras?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> Because the defense asked for it, basically. The defense argued that it would hurt their clients' chance for a fair trial and the judge sustained their objections to the camera.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> By taking out the imperfect defense ruling, hasn't Weisberg essentially decided the case himself. Shouldn't that have been a jury question?</P>

<P><B>MJStevensn:</B> A lot of people believe it should have been a question for the jury and not the judge. But Judge Weisberg said the evidence did not support the imperfect self defense theory and therefore he was within his discretion not to allow it.</P>

<P><B>CourtTV9:</B> Mary Jane has to go now. She will be reporting on the trial until a verdict is reached. Tonight she was on Prime Time Justice and In Context With Arthur Miller. Good night everybody.</P>

<h2>Aggravating v. Mitigating Circumstances</h2>

<P>The jury that deliberated the fate of Lyle and Erik Menendez had to consider the aggravating and mitigating circumstances presented during the penalty phase of the trial.</P>

<P>According to the California Penal Code, the following factors, if relevant, had to be considered:</P>

<P>The circumstances of the crime and the existence of special circumstances.</P>

<P>The presence or absence of violent criminal activity by the defendant.</P>

<P>The presence or absence of any prior felony convictions.</P>

<P>Whether the crime was committed while the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disorder.</P>

<P>Whether the victim was a participant in the defendant's homicidal conduct or consented to the killing.</P>

<P>Whether the crime was committed under circumstances which the defendant reasonably believed to be a moral justification or extenuation for his conduct.</P>

<P>Whether the defendant acted under extreme duress or under the substantial domination of another person.</P>

<P>Whether at the time of the crime the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was impaired as a result of mental disease or defect, or the affects of intoxication.</P>

<P>The age of the defendant at the time of the crime.</P>

<P>Whether the defendant was an accomplice to the crime and his participation was relatively minor.</P>

<P>Any other circumstances which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime. (This consideration is known as Factor K. Defense attorneys consider it a wild card, the catch-all -- anything at all that may diminish the gravity of the crime. The rule of thumb for defense attorneys is that there is almost no limit to what can be considered mitigating evidence.)</P>

<h2>Penalty Phase: How It Works</h2>

<P>The jurors who convicted Lyle and Erik Menendez of first-degree murder then had to decide whether the brothers should be sentenced to life in prison or death by lethal injection.</P>

<P>The penalty phase of the trial was different from that in most trials. The prosecution usually presents evidence first, often testimonials from the victim's family, known as "victim impact statements."  But most of Jose and Kitty Menendez's relatives supported the brothers. Brian Andersen, the brother of Kitty Menendez, was the only family member to publicly express support for the state's case.</P>

<P>So the prosecution had to wait while the defense presented its case to the jury of eight men and four women.</P>

<P>The rules of evidence in the penalty phase differ greatly from those during the guilt phase of the trial. Since jurors are asked to make a life or death decision, the defense is allowed to appeal to their sympathy. </P>

<P>The rules allowed the defense to offer evidence of mitigating factors, such as the brothers' ages, whether they were "under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance," whether  "the victims were participants in their own deaths" and any other evidence that diminished the gravity of the crime.</P>

<P>So the jury heard testimony about the brothers' lives and the allegations of parental abuse that was declared inadmissible during the murder trial. Defense attorneys started with the brothers' early childhood and worked their way up to the present. The defense witness list included relatives, friends, coaches, teachers,  the brothers' therapists,  Kitty Menendez's psychiatrist,  Jose Menendez's business associate and a priest.</P>

<P>During the closing argument part of the penalty phase, the prosecution goes first and then the defense. There is no prosecution rebuttal closing argument. The rules also are much more lax. The attorneys are allowed to say almost anything. They may not evoke religion but they can quote from the Bible. The only thing they are not allowed to do is describe how an execution takes place.</P>

<h2>The Jury Instructions</h2>

<P>The jury that deliberated the fate of Lyle and Erik Menendez worked with a set of jury instructions dramatically different from those in the first trial. </P>

<P>At the first trial, jurors had the option of convicting the brothers on the lesser offense of manslaughter based on the brothers' imperfect self-defense theory: that they had a genuine but unreasonable belief that their parents were on the verge of killing them.</P>

<P>This time, Judge Stanley Weisberg threw out that instruction. The judge ruled there was not sufficient evidence that the brothers were in imminent danger when they burst into the living room den and fatally shot their parents on August 20, 1989.</P>

<P>At the first trial, jurors also had the option of returning manslaughter verdicts on the basis of heat of passion - that the brothers killed after a sudden quarrel or in anger.</P>

<P>This time, the defense was allowed to argue that the brothers shot their father in the heat of passion, but not their mother. While there was sufficient evidence to show that Jose Menendez might have provoked his sons into committing a homicide, there was insufficient evidence to show that Kitty did so, the judge said.</P>

<P>The jury had to reach verdicts on three counts for each brother:  two counts of murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder. Also, there are two special circumstances -- lying in wait and multiple murder.</P>

<P>Once the jury found the brothers guilty of first-degree murder, it had to decide the special circumstances of lying in wait -- whether the murders were committed after a period of waiting and watching for an advantageous moment to take the victims by surprise. In other words, an ambush. </P>

<P>Because the jury convicted both brothers of first-degree murder on both counts, multiple murder automatically applied.</P>

 SUPPLEMENTAL MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN RESPONSE TO
PEOPLE'S PROFFER OF EVIDENCE

 INTRODUCTION

   At the hearings on the prosecution's Proffer on
December 19 and 20, 1994, the Court entertained argument
regarding the admissibility of all items of evidence contained in
the Proffer. At the hearing, the parties were to assume that the
evidence would be offered before a single jury, even though such
determination had not been made by the Court at that time.

   Counsel for Lyle Menendez indicated to the Court
that, because the Proffer was originally presented to assist the
prosecution in its determination as to whether to seek a single
or separate trials for the Menendez brothers, Lyle Menendez had
addressed in writing only those portions of the Proffer dealing
with the issues of cross-admissibility in a single trial. Thus,
items of evidence which were presented before the jury for Lyle
Menendez at the last trial were not addressed in the Response by
Joseph Lyle Menendez to People's Proffer of Evidence to be
Presented Before a Single Jury filed June 13, 1994 ("Response").
The Court indicated that any supplemental arguments which the
parties wished to raise could be submitted in written form.

   The purpose of this memorandum is to amplify the
argument set forth in the Response respecting the so called
"escape plans" seized from the cell of Lyle Menendez in the
summer of 1990, and to reiterate certain objections previously
made with respect to other evidence offered against Lyle
Menendez not briefed in the Response.

THE COURT'S ORIGINAL RULING WAS CORRECT AND THE SO CALLED
"ESCAPE PLANS" SHOULD NOT BE ADMITTED IN THE SECOND TRIAL

   Prior to the first trial of Lyle Menendez, the
prosecution on March 15, 1993 filed a Motion to Admit Evidence.
On April 20, 1993 Lyle Menendez the filed his Response to
Prosecution Motion to Admit Evidence("April 20, 1993 brief").
Both the prosecution and defense documents were filed under
seal. A copy of Lyle Menendez's April 20, 1993 brief (along with
a similar response by Erik Galen Menendez) was lodged with the
Court at the time his Response was filed on June 13, 1994 [FN1].

   At the first trial the Court excluded the so called
"escape plans" from admission before Lyle Menendez's jury [FN2].
However, certain of the arguments made in the April 20, 1993
brief and orally by former counsel for Lyle Menendez were
referred to by the Court at the recent hearing. Specifically,
the Court cited the case of People v. Turner (1990) 50 Cal. 3d
668, 694 n. 10, as potentially supporting the admission of the
so called "escape plans" in the next trial.

   Upon review of the language cited in Turner, it
appears that the Supreme Court did state in dicta:

   "Guilty flight may be relevant not only where the
identity of the perpetrator is at issue, but also where the
accused admits some or all of the charged conduct, merely
disputing its criminal implications. (Citations omitted).
Defendant admitted killing Savage, but the defense and
prosecution differed sharply on the circumstances. The
prosecution theorized that defendant intended to murder and rob
the victim. Defendant claimed an unintentional killing in self
-defense and also denied an intent to steal. Under these
circumstances, the prosecution was entitled to use evidence of
guilty flight to help prove defendant's criminal state of mind."
Id. (Emphasis added).

  The following year, however, the California Supreme Court
had occasion to consider the same question, i.e. the relevance
of the flight instruction in a homicide case where the contested
issue was not identity, but the state of mind of the defendant
at the time of the killing, and took the opposite position. In
People v. Nicolaus (1991) 54 Cal. 3d 551, 579. the Court stated:

  "Like the instruction on false or deliberately misleading
statements, the flight instruction '[does] not address the
defendant's mental state at the time of the offense and [does]
not direct or compel the drawing of impermissible inferences in
regard thereto.'" (Citation omitted). Id. (Emphasis added).

  It was argued previously that, because identity was (and
will be) conceded by Lyle Menendez, the sole issue for the jury
to determine is his mental state at the time of the killings.
Since the most recent proclamation by the Supreme Court is that
flight does not address this issue, the evidence itself has no
relevance in this upcoming trial.

  In addition, even assuming some marginal relevancy, the
evidence should be excluded under Evidence Code 352. Although
labeled the "escape plans In numerous briefs and arguments of
the parties, in fact the documents in question are far from a
realistic "plan." They are not even a single cohesive document.
Some of the pages seem to be simply scribbles of thoughts or
lists. Others perhaps are notes to or about other inmates of
some local notoriety. To the extent the papers do seem to
indicate some type of ruminations of travel from the jail, they
can hardly be described as "plans." The geographical
destinations range from San Diego to Lebanon, from Columbia to
France, and include Canada, London, Mexico, and Belgium. An
"escape" through all of those locations would be challenging, to
say the least.

  Additional pages of the supposed "escape plans" are simply
lists of given names, some of which are the same as those of
some attorneys or witnesses in the case, and have no apparent
connection to the other pages. The danger that the jury will
misconstrue the meaning of. or invent reasons for, the existence
of such names when offered in connection with other pages and
described as a single document is obvious.

   These disorganized and fantastical notes misnomered
as "plans" are, as previously argued, nothing more than
"rumination on the concept of escape." The prosecution has no
evidence that Lyle Menendez actually took 'any steps toward
actually attempting an escape. The complete absence of any actus
reus reduces the pages removed from Lyle's cell merely to
"wishful thinking" at the most. However, references to a
"silencer" and the overall crime of escape could lead a jury to
wrongfully use the documents "bad character" and "other crimes"
evidence. (See Evidence Code 1101). The potential for misuse of
the evidence and prejudice to the defendant far outweighs the
minimal, if any, probative value.

   Finally, the so called "seventeen page letter" seized
from the cell of Erik Menendez at the same time the "escape
plans" were seized makes it clear that such possible thoughts of
escape related not to consciousness of guilt, but to an
overwhelming desire on the part of Lyle Menendez not to reveal
to the world the secrets of his family. He wrote to Erik in the
letter seized less than three months after his arrest:

   "We alone know the truth - we alone know the secrets
of our families (sic) past. I do not look forward to
broadcasting them around the country. I pray that it never has
to happen. If it were not for you I doubt I would even try for
manslaughter. I would rather try and escape or die. I struggle
with my belief that men take responsibility for their actions,
pleading abuse is not taking responsibility...." This
elaboration on the so called "escape plans" makes it clear that
any escape fantasies by Lyle Menendez related to his desire to
avoid the shame of revealing the truth, and not to a
consciousness of guilt or to his mental state at the time of the
killings. The Court's determination that the so called "escape
plans" were inadmissible in the last trial before Lyle
Menendez's jury alone was the correct decision, and such
proffered evidence should again be excluded in the upcoming
trial.

     III.

THE COURT SHOULD REVIEW ITS RULINGS RESPECTING THE
PREVIOUS ADMISSION OF ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE BEFORE THE LYLE
MENENDEZ JURY

  At the December 19, 1994 hearing, the Court also indicated
its view that it was not bound by its prior rulings in this
case, and its potential willingness to reconsider such rulings
in connection with the retrial. In this regard, defendant
requests that the Court reconsider the arguments by Lyle
Menendez in his April 20, 1993 brief, in all additional briefs
filed with the Court, and all oral arguments previously made
respecting the Proffer of evidence respecting the admissibility
of certain testimony by Howard Witkin, Donovan Goodreau, Richard
Wenskowski, Glenn Stevens, Jamie Pisarcik, Brian Anderson, and
Marlene Eisenberg [FN3].

 CONCLUSION

   Defendant Lyle Menendez respectfully requests that the
Court consider this supplemental brief in connection with its
ultimate rulings on the Proffer, and exclude the Proffered
evidence as requested herein.

   Respectfully submitted,

v.

JOSEPH LYLE MENENDEZ and ERIK GALEN MENENDEZ, Defendants

CASE NO. BA068880

PEOPLE'S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT'S' MOTION
TO EXCLUDE EVIDENCE OF SPENDING

DATE: June 26, 1995 TIME: 9:00 A.M. PLACE: DEPARTMENT NW, "N"

TO THE HONORABLE STANLEY WEISBERG, JUDGE OP THE VAN NUYS SUPERIOR
COURT, AND TO THE DEFENDANTS AND THEIR ATTORNEYS:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that on June 26, 1995, the People of the State of
California will oppose the defendants' motion entitled "MOTION IN
LIMINE RE RECENTLY PROFFERED SPENDING EVIDENCE." This opposition will
be based upon this notice, the attached points and authorities, and
such argument as will be made at the time of the hearing of the
motion.

INTRODUCTION

This court has previously ruled that the prosecution may present
evidence that  after the defendants murdered their parents, they spent
their parents' money. This evidence includes the following purchases
and attempted purchases:

1. Two Rolex watches and money clips (Both defendants)
2. Marina City Condominium (Both defendants)
3. Porsche (Lyle Menendez)
4. Clothing and accessories-New Jersey and New York (Lyle Menendez)
5. A Private limousine and body guard-New Jersey and New York (Lyle
Menendez)
6. A patio home (Lyle Menendez)
7. A townhouse (Lyle Menendez)
8. A restaurant-Chuck's Spring Street Cafe (Lyle Menendez)
9. A million dollar-plus residence in Newport Beach (Erik Menendez)
10. Jeep Wrangler (Erik Menendez)
11. Private tennis coach (Erik Menendez)
12. Pool table (Erik Menendez)

With the exception of the million dollar-plus residence in Newport
Beach, all of the above-cited spending evidence was ruled admissible
in some form in the first trial. This Court has since ruled it
admissible in a joint trial conducted before a single jury. The
defendants now seek to exclude additional evidence of their spending.
Specifically, they seek to exclude evidence of the following
expenditures:

1. Rental of the bungalow suite at the Hotel Bel-Aire
2. A ski trip to Aspen
3. Clothing and accessories purchased in Chicago, Illinois
4. A private limousine used in Beverly Hills and Chicago, Illinois
5. A Sony Big screen entertainment center
6. A Saab Automobile
7. A vacation to Cancun, Mexico
8. Skiing and gambling in Lake Tahoe
9. Traveling the professional tennis circuit
10. Investments at Smith Barney

The Defendants argue that insofar as the People can demonstrate that
each defendant fraudulently obtained $350,000 from the insurance
company, the prosecution should be precluded from also presenting
evidence that they spent the money obtained. They argue that evidence
of spending is more prejudicial than probative, and that it is
inadmissible character evidence.

Similar objections, made under Evidence Code 352 and 1101, were argued
on June 17 and July 26, 1993, before the start of the first trial. At
that time the court ruled that such evidence is not inadmissible
character evidence. The court also evaluated the evidence under
Evidence Code Section 352, and determined that the probative value of
the evidence outweighed any possible prejudice to the defendants.

Similar objections were raised after the first trial. On April 3, 1995
this court once again evaluated evidence of spending under Evidence
Code Section 352 and found it admissible. Additional arguments to
exclude evidence of spending were made on April 4, 1995, and were
rejected by the court.

The Court has thus considered and discussed, at length, the very
issues raised by the defendants in this motion in regard to evidence
of spending, and the court has repeatedly ruled that the defendants'
arguments are without merit.

The defendants seek to exclude all but one of the following 13 areas
of evidence which the People seek to present to the jury.

1. The party at the Bel-Aire hotel - In the first trial, spending at
the Bel-Aire Hotel was excluded after the defendants presented the
testimony of their cousin Henry Llanio, who testified that he helped
select the accommodations at the hotel as a meeting place for the
family immediately after the murders, and that he assumed the bill
would be paid by LIVE Entertainment.

In fact, the People will show through the testimony of Robin
Rosenbloom and others that the defendants used the suite to entertain
their friends, and that they threw a party immediately after the
memorial service in which, in the words of Ms. Rosenbloom, "no adults"
were in attendance. The defendants rented the most expensive suite,
ordered caviar and champagne, and Lyle Menendez paid for the
accommodations.

The People seek to present evidence of the lavish accommodations
available to them following the murders of their parents, as well as
the use they made of such accommodations. This evidence is relevant to
their state of mind immediately after the murder of their parents, and
is circumstantial evidence of their state of mind at the time of the
murder of their parents.

2. The Aspen ski trip- Testimony will show that the defendants took a
vacation shortly after they killed their parents. The issues raised[
by the defendants in their response in regard to this evidence are
matters which may be the proper, subject of cross-examination, but
such matters do not go to the admissibility of the evidence.

3. Shopping in Chicago, Illinois- This evidence of spending is similar
to the evidence of spending already ruled admissible by this court
through the testimony of Richard Wenskowski and Glenn Stevens. Here
again, issues raised by the defendants in their response in regard to
this evidence are matters which may be the proper subject of
cross-examination, but such matters do not go to the admissibility of
the evidence

4. Limousine rentals in Beverly Hills - The rental of limousine for
personal transportation is similar to the evidence previously ruled
admissible through the testimony of Richard Wenskowski. This evidence
is admissible for the same reason that limousine rentals in New Jersey
and New York were ruled admissible in the first trial.

5. Limousine rentals in New Jersey - Lyle Menendez' rental of
limousines was ruled admissible in the first trial, and should be
ruled admissible once again. Also admissible is Lyle Menendez'
interest in pricing bullet-proof limousines.

6. Limousine rentals in New York - Lyle Menendez' limousine rental in
New York was ruled admissible in the first trial, and should be found
to be admissible once again.

7. Limousine rentals in Chicago. Illinois - This evidence is
admissible for the same reason that limousine rentals in New Jersey
and New York was ruled admissible in the first trial.

8. The Sony Entertainment System - The People have provided the
defendants with a statement by Perry Berman in which he discusses his
personal observations and knowledge of a purchase of an elaborate and
expensive Sony sound system by Lyle Menendez. The defendants argue
that this purchase cannot be proven without documentation. While
documentation may be one way to establish the purchase, the testimony
of a witness having personal know1edge of this matter is an equally
valid way to establish the disputed fact.

9. A Saab Automobile - Lyle Menendez' purchase of a vehicle for Jamie
Pisarcik is relevant and admissible to show the defendant's use of his
ill-begotten gain. This evidence is not challenged by the defendants.

10. The Cancun, Mexico vacation - Here again the defendants offer no
proper reason why this evidence should be ruled inadmissible. Here
again also, documentation is not the only way to establish the
expenditures of the defendant, and the testimony of a percipient
witness can establish this fact. Nor is it relevant that the parents
of the defendants took the defendants on similar vacations before the
defendants killed them. That the defendants may have been accustomed
to living well does not defeat evidence of motive; to the contrary, it
demonstrates what the defendants were afraid of losing if they were to
be cut out of the will. For that reason, it establishes motive all the
more.

11. The Lake Tahoe ski trip- Evidence of a vacation and gambling, in
Lake Tahoe, including the fact that the defendant borrowed money from
Mark Slotkin is additional evidence of the defendant's state of mind,
and there is no proper reason to exclude it.

12. Professional tennis circuit-Israel - The defendant argues that
this is evidence of "work," - an argument to which only the privileged
could relate. In truth, this is evidence of the defendant's pursuit of
his personal goal of becoming a professional tennis player, a pursuit
made possible with the bloody money of his dead parents.

13. Investments at Smith-Barney Florida - This evidence of Erik
Menendez' spending is comparable to the purchase of a restaurant by
Lyle Menendez and should be ruled admissible on the same basis. Both
are relevant to the defendants' motive for committing the murders.

III. CONCLUSION

The defendants object to the admission of all but one of the 13 items
of evidence discussed above. Only two of these items were ruled
3dmissible in the first trial; the other items were not offered. The
defendants argue that one item of evidence was previously ruled
inadmissible ( the spending at the Hotel Bel-Aire) but the People ask
that this evidence be admitted based upon the evidence and arguments
only now advanced by the prosecution in regard to this evidence.

The defendants request that this court exclude evidence of spending
pursuant to Evidence Codes sections 350, 352 and 1101. In light of the
previous rejection ion by this court of similar arguments advanced in
regard to similar items of evidence, the People respectfully ask that
this court deny the defendants' request.

Respectfully submitted this 19th day of June 1995

PEOPLE'S MOTION TO EXCLUDE  
PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN BY AN  
UNIDENTIFIED PHOTOGRAPHER  
FOR AN UNKNOWN REASON 
 
DATE: JUNE 19, 1995 
TIME: 9:00 A.M. 
PLACE: DEPARTMENT NW "N" 
 
TO THE HONORABLE STANLEY M. WEISBERG, 
JUDGE OF THE VAN NUYS SUPERIOR COURT, AND 
TO THE DEFENDANTS AND THEIR ATTORNEYS: 
 
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that on June 19, 1995, the people 
of the State of California will move this court to rule that 
two photographs that were presented in the first trial 
depicting the defendants in the nude be excluded in the 
retrial because this evidence cannot be properly 
authenticated, is lacking in relevance, and is more 
prejudicial than probative under Evidence Code section 352. 
 
I. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
In the first trial of this matter the defendants introduced into 
evidence an envelope (exhibit 219) containing a set of 
negatives (exhibit 220) made from a single roll of film.  
They also introduced the proof sheet of these negatives as 
well as prints of these negatives (exhibits 221 through 234).  
These exhibits were received into evidence without 
objection by the prosecution.  The prosecution now objects 
to the defendants presenting exhibits during opening 
statements. 
 
In the first trial, Lyle Menendez claimed that his father took 
pictures of his private parts as well as those of his brothers 
while they were in the shower or the bath, or while they 
were changing their clothing.(1)  When shown the 
photographs now objected to by the prosecution, he 
described them in the following sequence: a family 
photograph, a photograph of himself, (2) a photograph of his 
brother Erik, something unidentifiable, the defendants, and 
some other boys, his father and Erik, three photographs of 
the defendants, his brother Erik and his mother, his brother 
Erik, (3) and the dog.(4)  No further foundation was laid for 
the admission of these photographs. 
 
Lyle Menendez was unable to identify the photographs now 
objected to by the prosecution as photographs taken by Jose 
Menendez because, he conceded, he had never seen these 
particular photographs before.(5)  Nor had he ever seen the 
photographs which he alleged had been taken of him and his 
brother.  The photos as an issue were ultimately received 
into evidence without objection by the People, even though 
neither this witness nor any other witness was able to 
establish that Jose Menendez had taken the photographs in 
issue.  Moreover, since the defendant had never seen any of 
the photographs that his father had allegedly taken of him, 
and insofar as he was, of course, unable to look through the 
camera lens while photographs were allegedly being taken, 
the witness is simply assuming that there was film in the 
camera, that the camera was working, that photographs were 
actually taken and developed, and that these alleged 
photographs would depict only his genital area. 
 
 The defendant's theory of relevance for this evidence is that 
it corroborates his claim that his father took photographs of 
himself and his brother in the nude for a lewd purpose.  He 
then reasons, in turn, that the taking of such photographs 
tends to support his claim that his father molested him and 
his brother.  He goes on to reason that this allegation of 
molestation, in turn, somehow tends to support his claim 
that he had an honest belief that his parents were going to 
kill him on August 20, 1989. 
 
It is the contention of the People that the photographs should 
be excluded from the retrial because there is insufficient 
authentication to establish that Jose Menendez took the 
photographs, that the taking of photographs does not tend to 
establish that Jose Menendez sexually molested the 
defendants, that acts of sexual molestation when the 
defendants were young children does not tend to establish 
that acts of sexual molestation of Erik Menendez continued 
into his adulthood, and that, in any event, this evidence does 
not tend to establish a belief on the part of the defendants 
that their parents were going to kill them on August 20, 
1989, particularly insofar as the defendants concede that 
they did not kill because they feared that their father was 
going to molest them, but only because they believed that 
their parents were going to kill them because they had 
threatened to reveal the family secret.  These photographs 
should thus be excluded pursuant to Evidence Code Sections 
1400, 350, and 352. 
 
 
II. 
 
THE PHOTOGRAPHS SHOULD BE EXCLUDED 
UNDER 
EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1400 
 
For the purpose of the Evidence Code, a photograph is a 
"writing" (Evidence Code section 250).  Writings must be 
authenticated before they may be received into evidence 
(Evidence Code section 1401).  Where the relevance of the 
evidence is dependent upon the existence of the preliminary 
fact of authenticity, the burden is on the proponent to 
produce evidence sufficient to sustain a finding as to the 
existence of the preliminary fact of the authenticity of a 
writing (Evidence Code section 403). 
 
Authentication, according to Evidence Code section 1400 
(a), means: 
 
(a)  the introduction of evidence sufficient to sustain a 
finding that it is the writing that the proponent of the 
evidence claims it is or 
(b)  the establishment of such facts by any other means 
provided by law. 
(emphasis added) 
 
Ordinarily, photographs are properly authenticated by 
simply establishing that the photo is a faithful representation 
of the objects or persons depicted.  Ordinarily, however, the 
identity of the photographer is not the key issue before the 
trier of fact nor the reason why the photographer is being 
offered.  Here, the preliminary fact of the identity of the 
photographer is critical to the relevance and admissibility of 
the evidence. 
 
The proponent of the evidence in issue contends that the 
evidence consists of two photographs taken by Jose 
Menendez.  That is the significance and the relevance of the 
writings in issue.  These photographs are neither properly 
authenticated nor are they relevant, unless it can be 
established that they were taken by Jose Menendez.  The 
burden is on the defendants to produce evidence sufficient to 
sustain a finding that these particular photographs wee taken 
by Jose Menendez, rather than by someone else.  If the 
photos wee taken by someone other than Jose Menendez- 
such as by children playing with the camera- they have no 
relevance whatsoever, and the admission of such highly 
inflammatory photographs into evidence, based upon the 
possibility that hey could have been taken by Jose 
Menendez, is highly prejudicial to the prosecution. 
 
Here the defendants are incapable of establishing the pivotal 
element upon which the relevance of the photographs is 
premised- the identity of the photographer who took the 
photographs.  The defendants never saw any of the 
photographs allegedly taken by Hose Menendez nor have 
they ever seen these particular photos before.  Rather than 
lay a proper foundation, they simply argue that their 
allegation that Jose allegedly took some photographs of 
them is sufficient to establish that he took these particular 
photographs.  That is like saying that because a decedent 
was sometimes observed signing company documents, the 
particular company document in dispute must have been 
signed by the decedent, and is properly authenticated by the 
anecdotal information. 
 
This court should find that there is insufficient evidence to 
support a finding that the evidence is what  its proponents 
purport it be- photos taken by Jose Menendez- not only 
because there are no witnesses who can establish the identity 
of the photographer, and not only because the allegation that 
Hose sometimes took photos is an insufficient basis upon 
which to conclude that Jose took these particular photos, but 
also because the nature of the evidence itself is inherently 
suggestive of the fact that neither Hose Menendez nor any 
other adult took the photos in question. 
 
This court has had an opportunity to view the evidence in 
issue and this court is aware that the photos in dispute 
appear in a strip of negatives sandwiched between other 
photos of children such as those commonly taken at a child's 
party.  On the strip of negatives, contiguous to the two key 
photos in issue, is a photo of a door jamb.  The photographer 
had apparently held the camera at an angle and took an 
unfocused, tilted photograph of a door jamb.  Anyone who 
has ever seen a photograph taken by a young child would 
conclude that this photograph was obviously taken by a 
young child. 
 
The two key photos in issue are strikingly similar to the 
photo of the door jamb.  They are also photos taken at an 
angle, much like the manner in which the photo of the door 
jamb was taken.  The composition in both photos is so 
immature that the faces of the subjects do not appear in the 
photos.  The physical appearance of the photographs 
themselves is a consideration that this court can and should 
take into account in deciding whether the photographs have 
been sufficiently authenticated, particularly where there is 
no direct evidence of the identity of the photographer and 
where the defendants themselves are asking this court to find 
that he preliminary fact of authentication can be established 
through circumstantial evidence (the recollection of Lyle 
Menendez regarding the taking of the other photographs 
under different circumstances). 
 
We ask this court to find that in the absence of testimony 
from a competent witness as to the identity of the 
photographer, and in view of the fact that the nature of the 
photographs themselves strongly suggest that they were not 
taken by an adult, that the evidence is insufficient to support 
a finding that it is what it purports to be- photos taken by 
Jose Menendez as part of an on-going patter of abuse.  We 
ask the court to appreciate that the jury is being asked to 
speculate that the photos were taken by Jose Menendez for a 
lewd purpose, rather than by a child playing with the 
camera, or by some other person who simply thought they 
would make cute photographs,  Without proper foundation, 
the photographs invite speculation as to the identify to the 
photographer and the purpose for which they were taken.,  
We ask this court to find that he defendants have failed to 
lay a proper foundation for the admission of the photographs 
under Evidence Code section 1400, 350, and 403 to justify 
their admission. 
III. 
 
THE PHOTOGRAPHS SHOULD BE EXCLUDED 
UNDER EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 350 
 
Even if the defendants could establish, through competent 
evidence, the preliminary fact that the particular 
photographs in issue were taken by Jose Menendez rather 
than by another person, the photographs would still be 
inadmissible pursuant to Evidence Code sections 350 and 
352.  There are several theories for excluding the evidence 
under Evidence Code section 350, each theory premised 
upon leaps in logic made by the defendants in regard to this 
evidence: that it proves that Jose was molesting during the 
time period that he photographs were taken, that it proves 
that Jose was molesting Erik Menendez near the time of the 
murders, and that it bears upon the defendants' state of mind 
on the night of  the murders. 
 
1.  THE PHOTOGRAPHERS HAVE NO TENDENCY TO 
REASON TO PROVE          THAT JOSE MENENDEZ 
WAS MOLESTING HIS SONS 
 
In People v. Pitts, (1990) 223 Cal. App. 3d 606, the 
defendant was charged with child molestation and using 
children for purposes of pornography.  The crime had 
occurred at a location referred to in the opinion as the "green 
house."  A witness testified that, in another location (Knott 
Street) more than a year later, she had observed cameras, 
lighting equipment, a television set, light stands and a video 
camera used by the defendant to make tapes of child 
molestations, and she also testified to her observations of the 
witness regarding the video equipment and the pornographic 
videos was admissible: 
 
The basis for admitting this evidence was that children had 
testified to the use of the equipment and Idolina's testimony 
showed that Frosythe had the equipment used to make the 
child pornography with which he was charged.  The jury 
could infer that he ended up with the equipment used in the 
crimes charged, after the arrest of his coconspirators.  His 
possession of the video film would allow the jury to infer it 
was one of the films resulting from the conspiracy charged 
in the instant case.  Pitts at 820. 
 
The Court of Appeal, however, ruled that the admission of 
this evidence was reversible error because "the equipment 
used in the Knott Street acts was simply not sufficiently 
shown to be the equipment used in the green house."  Pitts at 
835.  The evidence thus impermissibly bolstered the 
credibility of the green house children, Knott Street video 
equipment was inadmissible for those purposes.  Pitts at 
837.  Because the Knott Street video equipment may not 
have been the same equipment used in the green house, the 
mere fact that the defendant had video equipment was 
improperly admitted, even though it was apparently used to 
make child pornography, and even thought the Knott Street 
video may have been made in the green house. 
 
Similarly, in the case before the court, the defendants seek to 
place nude photographs of themselves into evidence despite 
the fact that, even by their own account, these photos may 
have been taken by someone other than Jose Menendez.  As 
in Pitts, they seek to bolster their credibility with photos that 
could have been taken by another person.  Based upon Pitts, 
the photos should be ruled inadmissible. 
 
In Page v. Alaska (1983) 657 P. 2d 850, a murder case in 
which the defendant alleged that the victim had attempted to 
homsexually rape him, the defendant argued that the trial 
court had erred in excluding literature on aberrant sexual 
activity found in the victim's safe.  The books included, "I 
Pervert, Little's Brother's Big Thing, Sex in the Classroom, 
The World Practice of Anal Love, Torrid Women for the 
Young Boys, Masturbation, A lust for Incest, The Friendly 
Couples, Focus on Incest and the Illustrated Encyclopedia of 
Obscenity and Pornography." 
 
The Alaska Court of Appeals ruled that the lower court had 
not erred because the defendant had not established that a 
person who read those books would be more likely to 
commit homosexual rape than someone who didn't.  Page v. 
Alaska, supra at 851. 
 
Similarly, in the case before the court, in the absence of 
evidence that someone who takes pictures of a naked child is 
more likely than not to commit incest and child molestation, 
the photographs should be ruled inadmissible.  There is no 
necessary or causal connection between these photos and the 
alleged acts of molestation. 
 
2.  THE PHOTOGRAPHS HAVE NO TENDENCY IN 
REASON TO PROVE THAT  JOSE MENENDEZ WAS 
MOLESTING HIS SONS IN 1989 
 
The evidence should be excluded because the fact that the 
defendants were allegedly molested years earlier by their 
father has no tendency in reason to prove that Jose 
Menendez was still molesting his sons at the time of the 
murders.  Moreover, if prior acts of molestation has no 
tendency in reason to prove molestation in 1989, then 
certainly photographs which, in and of themselves, do not 
prove molestation but which simply depict children in the 
bathroom without their clothing on have even lesser 
probative value to the claims of molestation in 1989. 
 
3.  THE PHOTOGRAPHS ARE NOT RELEVANT TO 
THE DEFENDANTS'   MENTAL STATE ON AUGUST 
20, 1989 
 
As Lyle Menendez conceded in his testimony, he did not kill 
his father because of any alleged acts of abuse, but because 
he feared that his parents were going to kill him because 
they believed that he was going to reveal the family secret.  
Nevertheless, the defendants argue that this allegation of 
molestation somehow tends to support their claim that they 
had an honest belief that their parents were going to kill 
them on August 20, 1989.  There is no logical or causal 
connection between two, much less is there any logical or 
causal connection between photographs taken by an 
unidentified photographer for an unknown reason years 
before the murders, and the defendants' claim that on August 
20, 1989 they believed their parents were going to kill them 
for a reason unrelated to alleged acts of molestation 
occurring years earlier, and entirely unrelated to photographs 
taken years earlier. 
 
 
IV.  
 
THE PHOTOGRAPHS SHOULD BE EXCLUDED 
UNDER EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 352 
 
The determination that must be made by this court is 
whether the proffered evidence is probative of the ultimate 
issue in this case, how probative it is of that ultimate issue, 
and whether admission of the proffered evidence is 
outweighed by prejudice, the consumption of time, and the 
possible confusion of the issues and misleading of the jury.  
Not only should the photographs to which the prosecution 
objects be excluded under Evidence Code section 350, but it 
should be excluded under Evidence Code section 352 as 
well.  That section provides: 
 
The court in its discretion may exclude evidence if its 
probative value is substantially outweighed by the 
probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue 
consumption of time or (b) create the substantial danger of 
undue prejudice of confusing of the issues, or of misleading 
the jury.  (emphasis added). 
 
The decision to admit or exclude evidence under this 
Evidence Code section lies within the sound discretion the 
trial court, and the court's ruling not be reversed unless the 
probative values of the evidence clearly outweighs any 
probability that its admission will necessitate an undue 
consumption of time, or create a substantial danger of undue 
prejudices, of confusing of the issues, or of misleading the 
jury.  People v. Von Villas (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 201.  In 
evaluating the probative value of evidence, the court should 
not only consider the extent to which the evidence has a 
tendency in reason to prove an issue in dispute in the trial, 
but the court may also consider the remoteness of the 
evidence.  People v. Northrop (1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 1027.  
In Northrop, the Court of Appeal held that he trial court had 
properly excluded, under Evidence Code section 352, 
defense evidence of the defendant's extra judicial statements 
offered under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule, 
where the statements were made long before the crime, and 
the trial court ruled that the statements were too remote in 
time to justify their admission.  Not only are the 
photographs in issue lacking in any logical probative 
relationship to the claimed belief of the defendants that heir 
parents were going to kill them on August 20, 1989, but they 
were also taken at a point in time that is extremely remote to 
the time of the murders. 
 
We ask the court to rule that this inflammatory should be 
excluded from this trial because the probative value of such 
evidence is so collateral to the determination to be made by 
the jury concerning the defendants' mental state on August 
20, 1989 that whatever minimal value such evidence holds is 
outweighing by the countervailing considerations of 
prejudice, confusion of the issues and misleading of the jury, 
particularly where the identity of the photographer is a 
matter of speculation. 
 
V. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
For the foregoing reasons the People respectfully request 
that the court grant our motion to exclude the evidence in 
dispute from the retrial, and to bar the defendants from 
mentioning such evidence in their opening statements.

CASE NO. BA068880 
 
MOTION IN LIMINE RE  
RECENTLY PROFFERED  
SPENDING EVIDENCE 
 
DATE: JUNE 26, 1995 
DEPT.: NORTHWEST "N" 
TIME: 9:00 A.M. 
 
TO:  GILL GARCETTI, DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR 
LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND HIS 
REPRESENTATIVES, DAVID CONN AND CAROL 
NAJERA AND TO THE ABOVE-ENTITLED COURT: 
 
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that on June 26, 1995, at 9:00 
a.m., or as soon thereafter as counsel may be heard in 
Department Northwest "N" of the above-entitled court, 
defendants Erik Galen Menendez and Joseph Lyle 
Menendez will move this Court for an order prohibiting the 
prosecution from introducing additional so-called 
"spending" evidence on the grounds that the proffered 
evidence is irrelevant, or, if marginally relevant, its 
probative value is substantially outweighed by the 
probability that its admission will necessitate undue 
consumption of time or create substantial danger of undue 
prejudice, or of confusing the issues and of misleading the 
jury. 
Further, the proffered evidence is inadmissible because the 
prosecution has failed to demonstrate the existence of the 
foundational facts necessary to qualify most of this newly 
offered evidence as, in fact, evidence of spending by the 
defendants.  As specified below for most of this evidence 
there is no information in the discovery provided of the 
dates, amounts and sources of the expenditures that the 
people seek to admit in vague support of their theory that
the defendants killed their parents in order to spend their 
parents' money. 
 
The motion will be based upon pleadings, records and files 
herein, upon the previous testimony of witnesses addressed 
to these evidentiary issues, upon the written statements of 
witnesses provided to the defense by the prosecution in the 
course of pretrial discovery and upon the written statements 
of witness provided to the defense by the prosecution in the 
course of pretrial discovery and upon such other and further 
evidence and arguments as may be presented by defendants 
at the hearing of the motion.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
In letters to defense counsel dated April 26, 1995 and May 
5, 1995, the prosecution gave notice of its intention to 
introduce in it's case in chief information characterized as 
additional "spending evidence".  (Copies of those letters are 
attached hereto as Exhibits A1 and A2, respectively). 
 
In numerous previous hearings in this case the prosecution 
has asserted the relevancy of evidence of the defendants' 
receipt of funds as a direct result of the death of their
parents such as the proceeds of the Sun Life Insurance policy,
and the advance from the parents' estates given to Lyle, as 
evidence of motive.  In addition, the prosecution has been 
granted permission from this Court to introduce evidence of 
the defendants' actual spending or offers to spend specific 
large sums of money following the death of their parents as 
further evidence in support of their motive theory even 
though this sort of evidence is obviously of a more 
speculative kind depending, as it does, upon the notion that 
had they not killed their parents but merely received the 
insurance proceeds or inherited money from the estates they 
would not have spent it. 
 
Now the prosecution, seeking to shore up its motive theory, 
wishes to introduce evidence of various activities of the 
defendants, the cost of which are apparently unknown, under 
this ever growing and increasingly amorphous category of 
"spending evidence". 
 
Additionally, the prosecution should not be permitted to use 
the same evidence twice to create a false impression of the 
existence of a large quantity of circumstantial motive 
evidence.  As the record of the first trial demonstrates, there 
is, in fact, no direct evidence of motive at all.  The 
circumstantial evidence relied upon by the prosecution to 
establish its financial gain motive was of two kinds.  First, 
that each defendant received money as a consequence of 
their parents' deaths in the form of proceeds from their 
father's life insurance policy and, with respect to Lyle 
Menendez only, as an advance distribution from the estates 
of his parents with which to purchase a restaurant.  The 
second type of circumstational evidence of motive was that 
the defendants spent or offered to spend large sums of 
money between September 1989 and February 1990.  The 
court permitted introduction of evidence on a large number 
of expenditures on items ranging from Lyle's purchase of a 
restaurant to Erik's purchase of a pool table. 
 
Since evidence at trial indicated that the estates of Jose and 
Mary Louise Menendez were still pending distribution at the 
time of the defendants' arrest, the only source of funds for all 
but the restaurant purchase was the insurance proceeds.  
Thus, the prosecution was permitted extensive use of double 
counted evidence of both the receipt of funds and the 
expenditure of the same funds by the defendants.  In 
addition, the prosecution was permitted in the first trial to 
prove against Erik (since ruled admissible against Lyle as 
well) an aborted offer to purchase a condominium at the 
Marina City Club.  Further, the Court has recently ruled that 
it will permit the prosecution to prove against Erik in the 
upcoming trial a February 1990 aborted offer to purchase a 
house in Marina Del Rey.  Presumably these semi-spending 
activities were permitted because they arguably speak to the 
defendants' states of mind vis a vis their potential 
inheritance of the proceeds of their parents; estates.  
Interpreted thus they do not constitute further double 
dipping of the insurance proceeds evidence especially since 
if these purchases had been made, they would have exceeded 
the sums obtained from Sun Life.  However, with the 
exception of the previously ruled inadmissible item #1, the 
balance of the items on the prosecution's recently submitted 
list consists of cumulative evidence of further and 
increasingly petty expenditures of presumably, the insurance 
money.  Unlike the previously admitted evidence of this 
type, however, the people have demonstrated little factual 
support by way of dates, amounts and actual payments by 
the defendants for these items. 
 
Even with specific facts of large expenditures this type of 
evidence is only marginally probative at best.  One would 
expect young men raised by financially liberal parents but 
unaccustomed to managing their own affairs to spend rather 
loosely after coming into possession of a large sum of 
money whether they obtained that money by fair means or 
foul.  There has already been more than enough latitude 
given to the prosecution to bootstrap both the receipt of 
funds and their expenditure to convey the false and 
misleading impression to the jury of the existence of a large 
quantity of financial gain evidence when in fact there are 
only two separate acts of gain, the insurance proceeds and 
the estate advance.  The impropriety of allowing unfettered 
double use of the same "money"  evidence is apparent when 
analyzing the limited way in which this type of evidence is 
logically relevant. 
 
It is commonly understood that the value of money is not 
intrinsic.  Only in its function as an instrument of exchange 
does money become the much sought after object of human 
endeavors both legal and illegal. 
 
The rationale underlying the concept of financial gains as a 
motivator for criminal acts is that the miscreant seeks to 
have the money in order to spend it.  But whether the money 
is in fact spent or not the proof of a financial gain motive is 
complete with the act of abstaining the funds.  What is done 
with them later is irrelevant.  Even if someone merely 
hoards the money, the sense of power and security gained by 
such act is the knowledge that it will be available to be spent 
in the future. 
 
The Court has already ruled that numerous examples of 
specific quantified, timely expenditures by the defendants 
may be admitted at their joint trial, accompanied by a 
cascade of limiting instructions.  As demonstrated below the 
prosecution is now speculative, cumulative, confusing and 
time consuming matters of little or no probative value 
except the forbidden one of character assassination. 
 
ITEM BY ITEM ANALYSIS 
 
1.  Item #1 on the prosecution list reads "Bungalow Suite at 
the Hotel Bel Aire- Los Angeles, California (Both)".  At the 
first trial the prosecution sought admission of evidence that 
the defendants rented a suite (the bungalow part a recent 
descriptive addition undisclosed in the material the defense 
has in hand) at the Hotel Bel Aire and proceeded to incur 
extensive room, telephone and room service charges.  An 
Evidence Code Section 402 hearing was held concerning 
this evidentiary offer on August 13, 1993 at which 
defendants' cousin Henry Llanio testified that he, having 
decided that the defendants should stay at a hotel 
accompanied by Lyle Menendez only, engaged the suite at 
the Bel Aire.  He further testified that the suite was meant to 
be a meeting and eating place for the entire family and 
served as such.  More over it was his belief that LIVE 
Entertainment would be paying for the suite just as they 
were paying for his and the rest of the family's hotel 
accommodations at the Hotel Bel Age.  A Copy of this 
testimony is attached at Exhibit B1.  Based upon this 
testimony the Court ruled the evidence inadmissible stating, 
inter alia, at RT Vol. 68, p. 10864 
 
...(It does seem that the evidence is ambiguous, at best, and 
the probative value of it is substantially outweighed by the 
potential confusion of issues. 
It really doesn't have any relevance in that it doesn't prove 
anything. 
It doesn't establish the state of mind of the defendants in 
spending large sums of money. 
A copy of the Court's ruling is attached as Exhibit B2. 
 
The prosecution offers no new evidence that would 
undermine the previous ruling of this Court.  With the 
exception of Robin Rosenbloom, the witnesses it lists and 
the documents it offers (the hotel bill) are the same as those 
they were prepared to offer at the first trial.  As for Ms. 
Rosenbloom, she apparently has nothing relevant to say on 
this issue except that Erik and Lyle (whom she does not 
mention seeing) had a room at the Hotel Bel Air the day of 
the Memorial service for their parents.  One suspects that the 
only purpose the prosecution has for calling her is not to 
establish "spending" evidence but to establish "partying" 
evidence.  Copies of the police report statements of the 
witnesses and the documents designated by the prosecution 
on this issue are attached as Exhibit B3. 
 
 
2.  Item #2 reads "Skiing trip to Aspen-Aspen, Colorado 
(Both)".  The designated witnesses are Mark Heffernan and 
Brian Andersen.  An examination of the prior testimony and 
all the police interviews with Mark Heffernan reveals no 
information whatsoever concerning a skiing trip by the 
defendants to Aspen, Colorado.  The only reference to this 
event by Brian Andersen appears in RT Vol. 133 at page 
23038 as follows: 
 
Q.  Did you go on a vacation with Erik after his parents were 
killed? 
A.  The skiing vacation? 
Q.  That qualifies as vacation? 
A.  Uh-Huh 
Q.  Did you? 
A.  Yes 
Q.  Where did you go 
A.  To Aspen, Colorado 
Q.  And who else was there? 
A.  Mark Heffernan and Lyle. 
 
A Copy of this page of the transcript is attached as Exhibit 
C. 
 
Who paid for this vacation?  How much did it cost?  Was it 
planned before the Menendez parents were killed?  Did it 
represent a change in the defendant's lifestyles or was it like 
all the other ski trips that witnesses testified they took over 
the course of their lives?  These and other questions are 
unanswered by the discovery and testimonial records.  What 
is the probative value of this evidence?  None. 
 
 
3.  Item #3 reads "Clothes and accessories-Chicago, Illinois 
(Lyle only)".  The witness is Mark Andersen.  A copy of the 
police interview of this witness is attached as Exhibit D.  
The crux of the pertinent portion of that statement is that 
while Lyle was in Chicago in January 1990 he, Mark 
Andersen and Alan Andersen spent 10 hours at a shopping 
mall.  Lyle charged $3,500 a charge card.  Lyle bought suits.  
No mention of the "accessories" appears.  Likewise, there is 
no itemization of the $3,500 nor the number or price of the 
suits nor any indication of for whom they were purchased.  
The jury is to assume that this extravagance without proof 
that it is.  They are to further assume that extravagance 
equals motive.  Like the rest of this type of evidence there is 
no indication that Lyle was lacking in suits or anything else 
before his parents died, nor that an overwhelming desire for 
suits caused him to kill his parents.  The real purpose of this 
evidence (and the other nasty things Mark Andersen is 
quoted as saying about Lyle's behavior during the shopping 
excursion) seems to be the "spoiled rich kid" character 
attack. 
 
 
4.  Item #4 reads "Private limousines (emphasis added)- 
Beverly Hills CA (Lyle only)".  The witness is David 
Cambell.  The relevant portions of his police interviews of 
September 1, 1989 and July 27, 1994 are attached as Exhibit 
E.  In those statements Mr. Campbell indicates that on 
August 31, 1989, after having dinner with Lyle (at an 
undisclosed restaurant) he saw Lyle get into a limousine.  
Was this a $50 lime, a $100 limo?  Who picked up the tab 
for it?  Was this in Beverly Hills?  How is this conceivably 
proof of motive?  It isn't/ 
 
 
5.  Item #5 reads "Private limousines-Princeton, New Jersey 
(Lyle only)" - the witness is Richard Wenskoski.  IN the 
attached page of the police report of September 19, 1989, 
attached as Exhibit F1, the witness states that Lyle used the 
phones in the limousines that were rented for him.  This is 
during the period of time when Lyle was in Princeton for the 
funeral of his parents.  Everyone there for the Menendez 
rites was transported in a limousine.  The company paid for 
them. 
 
Similarly in his testimony of July 27, 1993 appearing in RT 
vol.55 at page 8042, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 
F2 the witness only makes passing reference to the fact that 
Lyle traveled in a limousine in New Jersey. 
 
 
6.  Item #6 is similar to item #5 but here the reference is to 
Lyle using private limousines in New York.  The Wenskoski 
statement of August 29, 1994 addressing this issue consists 
again of only a passing reference to the fact that when in 
New York Lyle went to the U.S. Open and "made a point to 
use the phone in the limousine".  A copy of that statement is 
attached as Exhibit G.  Neither the information from 
Wenskoski in support of item #5 nor item#6 proves that 
Lyle spent anything.  The mere fact of using limousines 
within a few days of his parents deaths, before he received 
the insurance money, and paid for by persons unknown 
hardly constitutes the spending of large sums of money that 
this Court has repeatedly referred to as the justification for 
admitting spending evidence as probative of motive. 
 
 
7.  Item #7  reads "Private limousines- Chicago Illinois 
(Lyle only)".  The designated witness is Mark Andersen.  
There is but one police interview of this witness.  It says 
nothing about limousines.  Perhaps the prosecution "forgot" 
to turn over discovery on this issue.  Perhaps they are 
confused.  Perhaps, to paraphrase, they did not "study (the 
record) carefully so that should they decide to (proffer) 
any...evidence (they) may do so in an articulate manner with 
the appropriate (factual) (basis)."  (see final paragraph of 
Conn\Najera letter (Exhibit A2)). 
 
 
8.  Item #8 reads "A state of the art Sony big screen 
television with speakers, amplifiers and an entire sound 
system.  (Lyle only)."  The designated witnesses are Perry 
Berman and Jamie Pisarcik.  The only reference to these 
items in the discovery record appears in a police interview 
of March 13, 1995 with Perry Berman which reads "Lyle 
bought Rolex watches and an elaborate entertainment 
system that cost between $10,000 and $20,000.  The system, 
that he saw in Lyle's condo in Marina del Rey (which other 
evidence showed was rented contrary to the implication 
here), had an 8 foot Sony Screen, a state of the art 
equalizer... plus all the speakers to go with it."  A copy of 
this statement is attached as Exhibit H. 
 
A review of all the prior statements and testimony of Jamie 
Pisarcik yields no reference whatsoever to these items.  
Perhaps the prosecution "forgot" to provide the defense with 
this information.  Perhaps they are mistaken about Ms. 
Pisarcik's knowledge on this point.  Whatever the reason, 
repeated references in the proffer to witnesses who 
apparently have no information on the issues makes it 
unnecessarily difficult for the defense to respond. 
 
As with items #2 through #7 above there is no 
documentation of the actual purchase of these items, no 
accurate information of when, where or by whom they were 
purchased or how much they actually cost. 
 
 
9.  Item #9 reads "A Saab automobile (Lyle only)".  The 
designated witnesses are Perry Berman and Jamie Pisarcik.  
The defense does not object to the introduction of this 
evidence. 
 
 
10.  Item #10 reads "Vacation trip to Cancun-Mexico (Erik 
only)."  The designated witnesses are Charles Dickenson 
(sic) and David Mraovitch.  The first witness' name is, in 
fact, Charles Dickerson.  His information consists of nothing 
more than that while he was on vacation in Cancun on 
November 11, 1989 he encountered Erik Menendez there.  
David Mraovitch testified that he accompanied Erik to 
Cancun in November, 1989 and to conversations and 
activities he and Erik engaged in while there.  Mr. 
Dickerson's police interview bearing on the subject is 
attached as Exhibit I1.  Mr. Mraovitch's testimony on this 
issue, appearing in RT volume 105 at pages 17499 through 
17518 is attached as Exhibit I2.  As with probative value, if 
any of Erik Menendez having gone to Cancun in November 
of 1989, except, as Mr. Mraovitch testified, because he was 
depressed and needed a friend to cheer him up.  On the issue 
of motive as demonstrated by spending money, relevant 
facts are totally lacking.  Moreover, other testimony at the 
trial established that vacation trips were a regular feature of 
the Menendez family's lifestyle.  Given that and the fact that 
there is no information or documentation of the cost of this 
trip, the probative value of this evidence is nil. 
 
 
11.  Item #11 reads "Skiing trip to Lake Tahoe- Lake Tahoe, 
Nevada (Erik only).  The witness is Mark Slotkin.  A copy 
of the police interview of March 30, 1993 bearing on this 
issue is attached as Exhibit J.  The only expenditure made by 
Erik Menendez during this trip in December-January, 1989-
90  about which Mr. Slotkin has knowledge is a gambling 
debt of $4,000 to $5,000.  That evidence is not because it 
demonstrates the spending of a large sum of money such as 
would be arguably supportive of their motive theory but to 
portray Erik Menendez in an unfavorable light as a gambler.  
Even if the court found the amount involved had some slight 
probative value, in this instance it would be outweighed by 
its prejudicial effect. 
 
 
12.  Item #12 reads "Professional Tennis Circuit-Israel (Erik 
only)."  The witness is Mark Heffernan.  the sum total of 
Mr. Heffernan's input on this subject is contained in a police 
interview dated February 28, 1991, attached as Exhibit K1 
and his testimony of August 13, 1993 appearing in RT 
volume 68 at pages 11066-11067, attached as Exhibit K2.  
All he can apparently say is that he accompanied Erik to 
Israel for the latter to play in  a tournament.  There is no 
financial information provided at all.  The fact of Erik 
traveling to Israel in February 1990 to , in effect, work, has 
no probative value on this issue of motive. 
 
 
13.  Item #13 reads "Investments at Smith-Barney-Flordia 
(Erik only)."  The witness is Martha Cano.  A copy of the 
portion of her testimony appearing in RT volume 175 pages 
12568-12570 which refers to this issue is attached as Exhibit 
L.  The prosecution's description of this item contains all the 
information they have, to wit that Mrs. Cano made 
investments.  How many, how much, in what, how 
profitable or otherwise is left to the imagination.  Moreover, 
to allow the prosecution to prove the bare fact that some of 
the Sun Life money was invested at the suggestion of Mrs. 
Cano would be to permit the most blatant double use of the 
same facts.  The likelihood of misleading and confusing the 
jury by presenting a false bootstrapped picture of the so-
called motive evidence is especially great concerning this 
proffer. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The court has already ruled that item #1 is inadmissible.  
That ruling was correct when made and is still correct.  The 
defense is not objecting to the introduction of item #9 (the 
Saab).  With respect to all the other items proffered in the 
letter of May 5, 1995 the prosecution has failed to 
demonstrate that the evidence is relevant, probative or that 
its introduction would not result in the undue consumption 
of time, confusion of the issues and misleading the jury or 
that its probative value is not outweighed by the risk of 
substantial prejudice to the defendants.  Therefore, for the 
reasons set forth above and under Sections 350-352 and 
1100 et. seq of the California Evidence Code, the defendants 
respectfully request that the proffered evidence be excluded 
from the trial.

SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES

PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

vs

ERIK GALEN MENENDEZ and JOSEPH LYLE MENENDEZ, Defendants.

CASE NO. BA068880

OPPOSITION TO MOTION BY JOSEPH LYLE MENENDEZ TO PROHIBIT ERIK MENENDEZ
FROM INTRODUCING. EVIDENCE OF OUT-OF-COURT  STATEMENTS INCRIMINATING
LYLE MENENDEZ

TO GIL GARCETTI, DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY, TO DEPUTY
DISTRICT ATTORNEY DAVID P. CONN AND DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY CAROL
JANE NAJERA, HIS REPRESENTATIVES, AND TO JOSEPH LYLE MENENDEZ AND HIS
COUNSEL OF RECORD:

Defendant Erik Galen Menendez submits the following opposition to the
"Motion by Defendant Joseph Lyle Menendez for Order Prohibiting
Codefendant from Eliciting or Referring to any Out-of-Court Statements
by Codefendant which Incriminate Defendant." In this motion, which is
dated December 14, 1994, defendant Joseph Lyle Menendez seeks an order
from this Court prohibiting Erik Galen Menendez and his counsel from
eliciting or referring to any out-of-court statements by Erik Menendez
which might tend to incriminate Lyle Menendez. More specifically, Lyle
Menendez moves to preclude Erik Menendez from (1) cross-examining
prosecution witness Craig Cignarelli with respect to statements by
Erik Menendez which might incriminate Lyle Menendez and (2) examining
or cross-examining any other witness called by any party regarding
statements by Erik Menendez which might tend to incriminate Lyle
Menendez.

The motion filed on behalf of Lyle Menendez plainly demonstrates that
the statements the prosecution seeks to elicit from Craig Cignarelli
and others regarding out-of-court statements by Erik Menendez cannot
be "successfully edited" within the meaning of People v. Matola, 259
Cal. App. 2d 686, 693 (1968). Moreover, in making this motion, Lyle
Menendez fails to address Erik Menendez' rights under the Sixth,
Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution to
a fair and reliable determination of guilt and penalty and to a full
and fair presentation of his defense in this capital case. Simply put,
Erik Menendez has a right to present to the jury an accurate account
of Craig Cignarelli's recitation of Erik's alleged statements in a
manner that does not distort Erik's role in the events at issue by
omitting any reference to the actions of his brother Lyle before the
Menendez parents were shot. The prosecution may not be allowed to
improperly and unfairly inflate Erik Menendez' role in these events,
and increase Erik's level of culpability in the deaths of his parents,
by the device of seeking to try both brothers before the same jury.
Nor may codefendant Lyle Menendez accomplish the same result by a
motion to preclude cross-examination. See Erik Menendez' Response to
Prosecution's Proffer of Evidence to be Presented Before a Single
Jury, at 18- 19 .

Defendant Lyle Menendez' motion to limit cross-examination should also
be denied because this Court is not required to rule on matters of
cross-examination at this point in time, before the trial has
commenced and before there has been any evidence presented by any
party. See People v. Williams, 44 Cal. 3d 883, 912-913 (1988). See
also People v. Keenan, 46 Cal. 3d 478, 513 (1988) (a party has no
inherent right to a binding advance ruling on specific objections
which may be raised during cross- examination).

CONCLUSION

For the reasons discussed above, defendant Erik Gaien Menendez
requests that this Court deny Lyle Menendez' motion for an order that
Erik be precluded from eliciting any portions of his out-of-court
statements that incriminate Lyle Menendez, and thereby be denied full
and fair cross-examination and presentation of evidence in his
defense.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT 
The prosecution's most recent Motion to Compel 
Defendants to Submit to Psychiatric Examination and 
Psychological Testing (hereafter "Motion to Compel")' asks 
this Court to order psyc:hiatric examination of Erik Galen 
Menendez and Joseph Lyle Menendez by Dr. Park Dietz, 
whom the prosecution describes as a licensed psychiatrist, 
and Dr. Margaret Singer, described as a licensed 
psychologist.2  In support of its motion for a court ordered 
psychiatric and psychological examination of Erik and Lyle 
Menendez by experts retained by the state, the prosecution 
argues that it is entitled to conduct testing because "the 
defendants placed their mental state in issue in the first 
trial."  Motion to Compel, at p.3. However, as will be 
explained below, the case law cited by the prosecution does 
not support its present request for court ordered psychiatric 
and psychological examination of Erik and Lyle Menendez.  
In addition, the prosecution is not now entitled to concluct 
its own psychiatric or psychological examination of the 
Menendez brothers because such request is untimely, in 
that the prosecution waived its right to conduct testing by 
failing to pursue its Notice of Motion at the appropriate 
time during the first trial.  The prosecution's present motion 
is also premature, in that the requested psychiatric and 
psychological examinations may not be required unless and 
until a "mental state defense" is presented at the brothers' 
retrial.  Finally, although the prosecution has at this time no 
right to conduct the tests it seeks this Court to authorize, the 
defense may nonetheless agree to psychiatric examination 
and/or psychological testing, provided that certain 
questions regarding the scope of such examinations are 
satisfactorily answered and that the conditions under which 
the testing and interviews are conducted are adequate to 
insure the integrity of these procedures. 
 
II. 
 
THERE IS NO AUTHORITY FOR THE 
PROSECUTION'S REQUEST FOR A COURT-
ORDERED PSYCHIATRIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL 
EVALUATION OF ERIK AND LYLE MENENDEZ 
The prosecution's motion for psychiatric and psychological 
examination relies upon the case of People v. McPeters, 2 
Cal. App.4th 1148, 1190 (1992).  However, a reading of 
People v. McPeters demonstrates that the case is inapposite.  
The issue of the prosecution's psychiatric examination of 
the defendant in McPeters arose during the penalty phase of 
the case, not during the guilt phase and certainly not before 
the guilt phase had commenced. 
 
At penalty phase, McPeters presented the testimony of two 
psyc:hiatrists: one doctor testified he was a schizophrenic 
and the second doctor testified he was suffering from drug-
induced psychosis at the time of the murders.  The state 
requested that a prosecution psychiatrist be allowed to 
examine McPeters before the prosecution called that 
psychiatrist to testify as a rebuttal witness at penalty phase.  
The defendant refused to participate in the court-ordered 
examination, and the psychiatrist testified about his refusal 
to participate in the psychiatric examination during his 
testimony as a prosecution penalty phase rebuttal witness.  
The California Supreme Court found no error in this 
procedure: 
 
By tendering his mental condition as an issue in the Penalty 
phase, defendant waived his Fifth and Sixth Amendment 
rights to the extent necessary to permit a proper 
examination of that condition.  Therefore, those rights were 
not violated when the examining psychiatrist testified to 
defendant's refusal to cooperate. (Buchanan v. Kentucky 
(1987) 483 U.S. 402 [97 L.Ed. 2d 336, 107 S.Ct. 2906]; see 
also People v. Poqqi (1988) 45 Cal.3d 306, 330 (246 Cal. 
Rptr. 886, 753 P.2d 1082]; People v. Williams, supra, 44 
Cal.3d 883, 961-962).  Any other result would give an 
unfair tactical advantage to defendants, who could, with 
impunity, present mental defenses at the penaltv phase, 
secure in the assurance that they could not be rebutted by 
expert testimony based on an actual psychiatric 
examination.  Obviously, this would permit, and indeed, 
encourage spurious mental illness defenses. 
Cal.4th 1190 (emphasis added). 
 
People v. Poqqi, 45 Cal.3d 306, 229-330 (1988), which is 
cited by the McPeters court, involves the admission of 
prosecution psychiatric testing at penalty phase in an 
entirely different context than that presented in this case.  In 
Poqqi, the doctors who testified for the prosecution, Saul 
Faerstein, M.D. and Kaushal Sharma, M.D., had been 
previously appointed to examine the defendant on the issue 
of sanity, pursuant to Penal Code section 1026. The doctors 
testified at penalty phase based on their examination on the 
Penal Code section 1026 issue, and the defense sought to 
strike their testimony because neither psychiatrist gave the 
defendant the advisement required by Estelle v. Smith, 451 
U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 1866, 68 L.Ed. 2d 359 (1981).3   The 
California Supreme Court rejected this argument, based 
upon the United States Supreme Court's decision in 
Buchanan v. KentuckY, 43 U.S. 402, 107 S.Ct. 2906, 97 
L.Ed. 2d 336 (1987), which held that Estelle v. Smith does 
not apply where the defendant had initiated a psychiatric 
examination by court appo.inted experts by a plea of 
insanity and had presented psychiatric testimony on the 
issue as evidence in mitigation at penalty phase. Poqqi, 45 
Cal. 3d 229-30. 
 
This case is in a different procedural position than that 
presented in McPeters.  First, McPeters involved the 
penalty phase of the trial, where the issue is one of 
sentencing, not guilt or innocence.  Here, there has been no 
decision on guilt; indeed, the guilt phase of the present 
proceeding has not yet begun. Second, in McPeters there 
had been proceedings pursuant to Penal Code section 1368 
to determine the defendant's competence to stand trial and 
non-confidential psychiatric examination of the defendant 
by court appo:inted psychiatrists pursuant to section 1368 
of the California Penal code. McPeters, 2 Cal.4th at 1168-
1169. Cf. In re Spencer, 63 Cal.2d 400, 412 n. 10 (1965) 
(defendant's presentation of psychiatric testimony in 
support of a diminished capacity or insanity defense 
permits the prosecution to present opinion from a court-
appointed psychiatrist in rebuttal during the guilt phase of 
trial, with certain conditions to safeguard the constitutional 
rights of defendant, including an instruction that any 
statements made by defendant to the psychiatrist are not to 
be regarded as proof of the truth of the facts disclosed by 
the statements and may only be considered for the limited 
purpose of showing the information upon which the 
psychiatrist based his opinion).  The Menendez brothers 
have not offered a defense of diminished capacity or 
insanity and there have been no court-ordered, non-
confidential examinations on competence or sanity.  In re 
Spencer is therefore inapplicable to this case. 
 
The prosecution's reliance on Edney v. Smith, 425 F.Supp. 
1038, 1050-54 (1976) in support of its motion is also 
misplaced. First, decisions of the federal district courts are 
not binding on this Court. People v. Bradlev, 1 Cal. 3d 80, 
86 (1969). Second, Edney is factually distinguishable from 
the case before the Court. In Edney, testimony about a 
court-ordered psychiatric examination of the defendant was 
introduced at the guilt phase of the state court kidnapping 
and murder trial of a defendant who advanced the defense 
of legal insanity. 4 Moreover, the issue in Edney was the 
constitutionality of the New York statutory procedure 
applicable where there is a plea of not guilty by reason of 
insanity which provides for an examination of the 
defendant on the issue of sanity which may later be used by 
the prosecution if the defense at trial is legal insanity. 5 
 
The prosecution has previously represented that "Granviel 
(v. Estelle, 655 F.2d 673, 682 (Sth Cir. 1981)) applied the 
same principals (as Edney v. Smith) to a mental state 
defense." Notice of Motion, at p.6. However, this statement 
is incorrect. In Granviel, the issue of testimony as to an 
examination of the defendant by a psychiatrist called by the 
prosecution arose as a result of defendant having proffered 
an insanity defense at trial.6.  Granviel was examined by a 
psychiatrist on the issue of sanity, pursuant to a Texas 
statutory scheme that provided, inter alia, for the 
appointment of qualified disinterested experts to examine 
on the issues of competence and sanity and gave both the 
prosecution and the defense the right to call such 
disinterested experts. 655 F.2d at 681. The State of Texas 
then called an expert who examined the defendant on the 
issue of sanity as a witness at the trial, to dispute his 
proffered insanity defense.7  The facts of Granviel are 
therefore not analogous to the present case, and provide no 
support for the prosecution's present motion for a court-
ordered psychiatric and psychological examination before 
the guilt phase of the case has commenced. 
 
Finally, the prosecution relies upon the Federal Rules of 
Criminal Procedure, section 12.2, which requires that 
pretrial notice of a mental state defense be provided to the 
prosecution and further provides that the district court may 
order the defendant who gives notice of such a defense, to 
submit to a psychiatric examination "[i]n an appropriate 
case."8  However, the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 
do not apply to this state court trial. The Menendez brothers 
are not required to provide the prosecution with notice of 
their intent to present a mental state defense.  Nor may 
pretrial psychiatric examination be compelled based on the 
prosecution's expectations as to the nature of the defense to 
be presented at trial. 
 
III. 
 
THE PROSECUTION'S PRESENT MOTION TO 
COMPEL PSYCHIATRIC EXAMINATION AND 
PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING OF ERIK AND LYLE 
MENENDEZ IS BOTH PREMATURE AND UNTIMELY 
It is well-established that "for reasons of policy the 
psychotherapist-patient privilege has been broadly 
construed in favor of the patient." People v. Stritzinqer, 34 
Cal. 3d 505, 511-12 (1983).  Judges are required to 
construe narrowly any exception to the psychotherapist-
patient privilege and to apply this exception "only when the 
patient's case falls squarely within its ambit." Id. at 513. 
 
During the first trial of this case, over the objection of the 
Menendez brothers, this Court ruled that the manner in 
which the defense was presented brought the case within 
the "litigant-patient exception" to the psychotherapist-
patient privilege9 because the Menendez brothers tendered 
their mental condition. (113 R.T. 19449-51); see also this 
Court's order dated July 29, 1994.  Throughout the 
prosecution's present Motion to Compel, the state makes 
reference to the Menendez brothers having placed their 
mental state in issue during the course of the first trial.10  
However, the fact that this Court found a waiver of the 
patient-litigant privilege by virtue of the defense presented 
in the first trial does not create waiver of that privilege at 
the retrial. 
 
This Court has previously ruled, in the context of the 
prosecution's ability to relitigate this Court's evidentiary 
rulings during the first trial (167 R.T. 27276-77), that the 
ending of trial proceedings, whether by the granting of a 
mistrial, a motion for new trial or by reversal on appeal, 
returns parties to the position they were at prior to the 
beginning of the first trial. Cf. Guzman v. Superior Court, 
19 Cal. App. 4th 705, 707-08 (1993); see also People v. 
Thompson, 50 Cal. 3d 134, 177 (1990) (declaring a mistrial 
in a capital case renders the retrial "a judicial proceeding in 
which the matter in issue is again examined and resolved.") 
 
The limited nature of the patient-litigant privilege exception 
codified in Evidence Code  1016 requires that this 
exception not be applied unless and until the Menendez 
brothers present a mental defense during the second trial of 
this case.  There has been as yet no tender of a defense of 
any kind at the second trial.  Clearly, such a defense may be 
offered at retrial, as it was at the first trial.  However, the 
defense may well decide, based on the manner in which the 
new prosecution team presents its case-in-chief at the 
retrial, that the brothers will not present the testimony and 
evidence that they presented during the first trial.  There 
has been no defense testimony presented in this case, and 
no firm defense decision on what witnesses we will in fact 
call during the trial.  The list of witnesses provided to the 
prosecution pursuant to this Court's order regarding defense 
discovery is a list of potential witnesses who might be 
called at trial, but certainly does not require the defense to 
call any one of those witnesses.  On the contrary, the fact is 
that the defense may never call any witness as part of its 
case during this retrial.  Nor can this Court require us to 
make a decision at this point as to what evidence, if any, we 
will in fact present. 
 
During the first trial, this court found that the defense had 
placed the mental state of the defendants in issue only after 
hearing much of the defense case, including testimony 
presented from both Erik and Lyle Menendez. See 113 R.T. 
19449-5-1.  Although the prosecution had argued on a 
number of occasions prior to October 25, 1993, the date of 
the Court's ruling, that the defense, by virtue of its opening 
statement or by virtue of calling defense witnesses, had 
placed mental state in issue, this Court declined to rule that 
mental state had been placed at issue until that point in the 
trial where the defense had in fact presented its case to the 
jury.  See, e.g., 57 R.T. 8540-8545, 78 R.T. 13095-13101. 
 
During the first trial, the prosecution filed a motion seeking 
to compel a psychiatric and psychological examination of 
Erik and Lyle Menendez.  However, the prosecution did not 
seek a ruling from the Court on the issue of its right to 
conduct a psychiatric examination during the course of the 
first trial.  Having failed to pursue a psychiatric 
examination of the defendants during the first trial, the 
prosecution is not now entitled to obtain such a belated 
examination. 
 
Although the prosecution's motion states in conclusory 
fashion that this Court is authorized to invoke the waiver 
section of Evidence Code  1016 in anticipation of a 
defense,ll the prosecution cites no authority for this 
proposition, and none exists.  This Court may not violate 
the well-settled requirement that the Evidence Code  1016 
litigant-patient exception be narrowly construed with all 
doubts resolved in favor of the patient by acceding to the 
prosecution's demand for the anticipatory application of 
that provision.  On the contrary, the case law discussed 
above, and in related pleadings on this issue filed by the 
defense, 12 clearly indicates that the exception is limited 
only to those issues which are actually tendered by the 
litigant-patient.  The prosecution's request for a psychiatric 
examination and psychological testing of both defendants 
in this case, based upon either this Court's finding that 
mental state was at issue during the first trial or the 
prosecution's own speculation as to whether or not defense 
witnesses will, in fact, place mental state at issue is not 
legally 
cognizable. 
 
IV. 
 
CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE DEFENSE 
WOULD AGREE TO PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING 
AND PSYCHIATRIC EXAMINATION 
For the reasons discussed above, the prosecution has no 
right to a pre-guilt phase psychiatric examination or 
psychological testing of Erik and Lyle Menendez.  
Although the prosecution has no right to such testing, the 
defense may nonetheless have no objection to such 
procedure, provided that any testing or evaluation is 
conducted by qualified, unbiased mental health 
professionals, provided that any tests administered are 
propriate to this case and these defendants, and provided 
that the raw data obtained is scored by impartial, unaligned 
third parties. 
 
A. the Prosecution Has Provided Insufficient Evidence 
Regarding its Proposed Psychological Testing of the 
Defendants by Dr. Nargaret Singer 
 
The prosecution has proposed a two-step method of 
evaluation.  First, the prosecution proposes that Margaret 
Singer conduct "[psychological] tests traditionally used in 
the assessment of cognitive and emotional status of 
individuals." l3  The information provided by the 
prosecution is not sufficiently specific for the defense to 
evaluate whether to participate in the proposed 
examinations.  Although the areas to be tested are generally 
described by the prosecution, the state fails to name any 
specific tests that Dr. Singer intends to administer to Erik 
and Lyle Menendez.  The names of the tests that the state 
seeks to administer are necessary, for a number of reasons.  
First, it has been demonstrated that some standard 
psychological tests are in fact unreliable when administered 
to abused children.  For example, the literature suggests 
that the Minnesota Multiple Personality Index (MMPI) 
psychological test does not yield valid results when 
administered to abuse victims.  Secondly, the malingering 
aspect of the MMPI test is particularly problematic when 
this standard psychological test is administered to an 
individual who has been the victim of abuse as a child and 
young adult.  Studies have shown that victimized children 
often show scores of 90 or greater on the malingering scale 
as a result of their victimization, not because of 
malingering in the standard psychological sense. 
 
Because of the body of literature which demonstrates that 
standard psychological tests are not necessarily appropriate 
where there are allegations of a history of abuse, it is 
necessary for the prosecution to identify the tests Dr. Singer 
intends to administer in order for the defense to decide 
whether to participate in such a test procedure.  
Specification of the tests to be administered is necessary 
because if there are inappropriate psychological tests 
administered, then the psychological evaluation by Dr. 
Singer will be unreliable, and this in turn will affect any 
evaluation by Dr. Park Dietz.(14) 
 
B. The Prosecution Has Not Provided Sufficient 
Information About the Scope of the Examination to be 
Conducted by Dr. Park Dietz 
 
The prosecution proposes that Dr. Dietz conduct an 
"extensive psychiatric examination" of Erik and Lyle 
Menendez, and that such examination would "last[] 
approximately 20 hours each."  There is further description 
of the examination as consisting of an interview"covering 
general information as well as observation of each 
defendant's affect and emotion, ability to think and reason, 
and gross assessment of each defendant's cognitive 
function."  The prosecution has not offered any further 
information as to what Dr. Dietz proposes to talk about 
during the 20 hours he plans to spend with each brother.  
Conspicuously absent is any suggestion that Dr. Dietz will 
discuss Erik and Lyle Menendez' history of abuse at the 
hands of their parents.  Another issue to be considered prior 
to any final decision on whether to allow Erik and Lyle 
Menendez to consent to the proposed psychiatric 
examination is the scope of such examination.  The 
prosecution has in this case filed a number of motions 
aimed at limiting the scope of the defense expert testimony 
to be presented at the trial. See, e.g., People's Motion to 
Exclude Expert Opinion Concerning "Planning to Avoid 
Detection," People's Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony 
Criticizing the December ll Therapy Session with Dr. 
Oziel, and People's Motion to Exclude Testimony 
Concerning the Limbic System and the Theory of Genetic 
Recoding seeks to.  If the  prosecution seeks to so limit the 
scope of defense expert testimony, it could not then itself 
conduct a psychiatric evaluation of Erik or Lyle Menendez 
covering areas beyond the limits they now seek to impose 
on the defense. Therefore, it appears it may be necessary to 
resolve the issues of the prosecution's attempts to limit 
defense expert testimony prior to agreeing to any 
examination by prosecution expert. 
 
C. Appropriate Conditions for Psychiatric Examination and 
Psychological Testing In order for Erik and Lyle Menendez 
to voluntarily agree to participate in the proposed 
examination and testing by the prosecution, the defense will 
seek to insure the integrity of the examination, interview 
and testing process. 
 
The defense requests the opportunity to voir dire each of 
the prosecution's experts on the following issues: 
l. Their qualifications to perform the tests or conduct 
interviews on the specific issues that the prosecution seeks 
to address. 
2. Any biases that the expert might bring to the 
interviewing process. 
 
This inquiry is necessary to determine the qualifications of 
the two individuals retained by the prosecution.  In 
addition, because there has been a tremendous volume of 
pretrial publicity regarding the case, it is not unreasonable 
to expect that each of these experts may have followed the 
publicity that both preceded and postdated the first trial, 
and may have formed tentative opinions about one or both 
of the Menendez brothers, the defense or the defense 
experts as a result of their exposure to such publicity.  The 
defense therefore requests the opportunity to probe such 
attitudes. 
 
Further, the defense could only consent to testing and 
evaluation if the prosecution agrees that any results that 
they obtain by their psychological testing or psychiatric 
examination would not be used in their case-in-chief or in 
the penalty phase of this case.  See Estelle v. Smith, 451 
U.S. 461-69. 
 
The defense will also request that the raw data obtained 
pursuant to any test procedures be scored by impartial third 
parties.  Finally, we will ask that this Court order that all 
interviews of either Erik and Lyle Menendez, as well as all 
psychological testing, be recorded on videotape. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
For the reasons set forth above, Erik Menendez and Lyle 
Menendez respectfully request that this Court deny the 
prosecution's motion to compel a psychiatric examination 
at the present time and require the prosecution provide the 
defense with the information requested in this response.

3 In Estelle v. Smith, the United States Supreme Court held 
that the penalty phase admission of testimony from a 
psychiatrist who examined the defendant to determine his 
competence to stand trial violated his Fifth Amendment 
privilege against compelled self-incrimination because he 
was not advised prior to the psychiatric examination that he 
had a right to remain silent and that any statement he made 
could be used against him at sentencing proceedings. 451

trial] was sanity. 425 F.Supp. at 1039

analogous to that set forth in California Penal Code section 
1026, et seq. 
 
6 Granviel's complaint before the Fifth Circuit was that the

his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments 
because it did not allow the jury to consider as a mitigating 
factor at penalty phase evidence of his mental instability. 
655 F.2d at 674. 
 
7 The court in Granviel was careful to note that the expert 
who test:ified for the prosecution, a Dr. Holbrook, did not 
relate any statements made to him by Granviel, but testified 
only to his expert opinion on the issue of sanity derived 
from the psychiatric examination . 
 
8 The prosecution's motion quotes a version of Section 12.2 
of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that is no longer 
in efflect.  Motion to Compel at p.9. The present Section 
12.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides 
as follows: 
 
Rule 12.2. 
Notice of Insanity Defense or Expert Testimony of 
Defendant's Mental Condition  
 
(a) Defense of Insanity.  If a defendant intends to rely upon 
the defense of insanity at the time of the alleged offense, 
the defendant shall, within the time provided for the filing 
of pretrial motions or at such later time as the court may 
direct, notify the attorney for the government in writing of 
such intention and file a copy of such notice with the clerk.  
If there is a failure to comply with the requirements of this 
subdivision, insanity may not be raised as a defense.  The 
court may for cause shown allow late filing of the notice or 
grant additional time to the parties to prepare for trial or 
make such other order as may be appropriate. 
 
(b) Expert Testimony of Defendant's Mental Condition.  If 
a defendant intends to introduce expert testimony relating 
to a mental disease or defect or any other mental condition 
of the defendant bearing upon the issue of guilt, the 
defendant shall, within the time provided for the filing of 
pretrial motions or at such later time as the court may 
direct, notify the attorney for the government in writing of 
such intention and file a copy of such notice with the clerk.  
The court may for cause shown allow late filing of the 
notice or grant additional time to the parties to prepare for 
trial or make such other order as may be appropriate. 
 
(c) Mental Examination of Defendant.  In an appropriate 
case the court may, upon motion of the attorney for the 
government, order the defendant to submit to an 
examination pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4241 or 4242. No 
statement made by the defendant in the course of any 
examination provided for by this rule, whether the 
examination be with or without the consent of the 
defendant, no testimony by the expert based upon such 
statement, and no other fruits of the statement shall be 
admitted in evidence against the defendant in any criminal 
proceeding except on an issue respecting mental condition 
on which the defendant has introduced testimony. 
 
(d) Failure To Comply. If there is a failure to give notice 
when required by subdivision (b) of this rule or to submit to 
an examination when ordered under subdivision (c) of this 
rule, the court may exclude the testimony of any expert 
witness offered by the defendant on the issue of the 
defendant's guilt. 
 
(e) Inadmissibility of Withdrawn Intention.  Evidence of an 
intention as to which notice was given under subdivision 
(a) or (b), later withdrawn, is not, in any civil or criminal 
proceeding, admissible against the 
person who gave notice of the intention. 
 
9 Evidence Code 1016. 
 
10. see, e.g., p.1, line 6, p.l, line 27, p.5, lines 23-24, p.8, 
line 8-9, p.ll, lines 5-27, p.13, lines 1-27. 
 
1l See, e.g., the prosecution's Motion to Compel, at p.6, 
where it is urged that this Court should "order that the 
defendants submit to examinations now, rather than await 
such time as the defendants are willing to concede that they 
will offer mental state again." 
 
12 See Opposition to People's Motion Pursuant to Evidence 
Code Section 1016, filed July 28, 1993. 
 
13 The prosecution goes on to state that Dr. Singer is to 
administer psychological tests "covering the following 
areas:" (1) standard measures of intellectual functioning; 
(2) standard measures of cognitive functioning, including 
memory, spatial processing and language, test of concept 
formation and reasoning and motor ability; (3) measures of 
personality, mood and affect; (4) tests to detect a learning 
disability; and (5) tests to detect 
malingering. 
 
14 The prosecution has stated that Dr. Dietz would rely 
upon testing by Dr. Singer in his psychiatric evaluation: 
 
Dr. Singer's testing would be utilized by Dr. Dietz in a 
psychiatric evaluation of the information that the 
defendants give him, and specifically her results will aid 
him in confirming, contradicting or raising questions 
concerning their state of mind at the time of the crime.

PEOPLE'S SUPPLEMENTAL 
PROFFER OF EVIDENCE TO BE
PRESENTED BEFORE A SINGLE JURY 
 
DATE: DECEMBER 19, 1994 
TIME: 9:00 A.M. 
PLACE: DEPARTMENT NW  "N" 
 
TO THE HONORABLE STANLEY WEISBERG, JUDGE 
OF THE VAN NUYS SUPERIOR COURT, AND TO THE 
DEFENDANTS AND THEIR ATTORNEYS 
 
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that on December 19, 1994, the 
People of the State of California will move this court to rule 
that the following proposed testimony presented herein may 
be presented before a single jury in the retrial of the 
defendants. This motion will be based upon this notice, the 
previously filed points and authorities, and such argument as 
will be made at the time of the hearing of this motion. 
 
I 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
On May 16, 1994, the People filed a motion with this court 
entitled, "PEOPLE'S PROFFER OF EVIDENCE TO BE 
PRESENTED BEFORE A SINGLE JURY." This motion 
was filed in an effort to identify and litigate prior to the trial 
key areas of evidence that raise issues of admissibility 
before a single jury. Included in this proffer was the 
proposed testimony of Craig Cignarelli concerning 
admissions made to him by Erik Menendez. (see page 15 of 
that motion). This statement, offered as an admission of the 
defendant under Evidence Code section 1220 was redacted 
to deleted references to the defendant's brother Lyle 
Menendez. 
 
This proposed statement was based upon the testimony of 
Craig Cignarelli from the first trial. Upon reviewing the 
police reports of statements made by Craig Cignarelli, 
however, it is apparent that the testimony of Craig Cignarelli 
at the first trial only included a portion of the statements that 
Mr. Cignarelli originally related to the police. At this time 
the People seek to supplement our proffer of evidence 
concerning the proposed testimony of Craig Cignarelli. 
Specifically, the People seek to call Craig Cignarelli to have 
him testify to the contents of the reports dated November 
17, 1989 and March 7, 1990. 
 
II 
 
THE PROPOSED STATEMENTS  
 
The People propose to offer, through the testimony of Craig 
Cignarelli, the following statement contained in the report 
dated November 17, 1989: 
 
Erik Menendez said that he drove up to the house, opened 
the front gate, pulled into the driveway, unlocked the front 
door and walked in.  His parents were in the family room 
watching television. He walked outside to the front of the 
house and got a gun. He walked back inside and went into 
the room. He was unable to shoot his mother and she tried to 
get away. After it looked like his mother was dead, he shot 
her twice with his gun. He ran out the back door and jumped 
the fence to the front. 
 
He said that his father taught him everything, the only thing 
that he didn't teach him was how to live on his own. 
 
The People also propose to offer, through the testimony of 
Craig Cignarelli, the following statement contained in the 
report dated March 7, 1990. 
 
Erik Menendez said that he walked inside through the front 
door, into the foyer and up to the library. The left door 
leading into the library was slightly open. The right door 
was shut. He looked in and saw his dad sitting in the chair. 
His mom screamed and stood up, and he shot his mom after 
she had stood up. She was standing when he shot her. He 
continued shooting until the gun was empty. There was skin 
and blood on the wall. He opened the back door from the 
living room and left the house. He came back a couple of 
hours later and found them. The floor was cleared of all 
shotgun shells. 
 
Craig asked Erik why he shot his parents. Erik told him that 
all great leaders had no parents. He then gave examples of 
Alexander the Great and Hitler. He said that their parents 
had died or they had left their parents or something to that 
extent. Erik then said that he needed money to succeed in 
what he wanted to do in life. Dying was his father's final 
lesson to him, to be able to do things on his own and to 
teach him to live with responsibility. 
 
Erik was in a very descriptive mood and he was very quiet 
and very deliberate in what he had to say. Erik was walking 
through the library pointing out the areas where particular 
things happened. He stated that his father was seated in a 
chair or at the end of the couch. His dad and mom were 
watching a movie on television. His mom was at the end of 
the couch. After Erik shot her, she fell to the floor. 
 
Erik told Craig that he would get 45 million dollars and that 
his father had a Swiss bank account with approximately 80 
million in it. 
 
III 
 
ADMISSIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED STATEMENTS 
IN A JOINT TRIAL 
 
As more fully elaborated upon in our original motion, 
because the statements have been redacted to exclude 
references to the codefendant, they do not violate the 
principles of Aranda-Bruton. In Richardson v. Marsh, the 
Supreme Court provided for the mechanism of redacting a 
statement and offering it in a joint trial, provided that a 
limiting instruction is given which states in clear and 
unambiguous terms that the statement is limited to the 
declarant and cannot be considered against any other  
defendant. The People ask this court to follow the reasoning 
of Richardson and allow this relevant evidence to be 
admitted in a joint trial accompanied by an appropriate 
limiting instruction. 
 
Admission of this evidence would not violate Evidence 
Code Section 352 either. Once again, as discussed in our 
original motion, the California Supreme Court has 
interpreted the term "prejudice" in People v. Wright (1985) 
39 Cal.3d. 576, 585, as referring to statements which would 
"uniquely tend to evoke an emotional bias against ...(one 
party) as an individual" and which would have "very little 
effect on the  issues." The statements in issue are not so 
inflammatory that they would evoke an emotional bias 
against the declarant or the codefendant, who is not even 
mentioned in the statement. Hence, Evidence Code Section 
352 would not warrant the exclusion of this evidence, 
particularly where a limiting instruction is employed. 
 
In the first trial,  this court ruled that portions of the 
defendant Erik Menendez's confession to Mr. Cignarelli 
would be admitted before Erik Menendez's jury. Because 
both sides had agreed to proceed with two juries, the 
Aranda-Bruton issue and the 352 issue was not litigated in 
the prior proceeding. In this proceeding, where the People 
have indicated our intention to proceed with a single jury, 
we ask that the proposed statements be ruled admissible 
before a single jury. 
 
There was a discussion on the record concerning portions of 
the above-described reports in volume 53 of the transcript, 
starting on page 7644, line 9, and continuing to page 7680. 
The People indicated that they would not be offering the 
statement about "great leaders" on page 7658, lines 14-24. 
The People also stated on page 7674, lines 1-14, that they 
would not offer the statement concerning Erik Menendez's 
expectation concerning the 80 million dollar Swiss back 
account because they felt that Mr. Cignarelli did not have 
first-hand information concerning this. It is now our position 
that whether Mr. Cignarelli had personal knowledge of this 
account is irrelevant. What is relevant is that the defendant 
had this expectation. 
 
IV 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Based upon the argument appearing in our previously-filed 
motion, as well as our argument advanced in this motion, the 
People respectfully request that this court admit the 
statements in issue in a joint trial conducted before a single 
jury, accompanied by an appropriate limiting instruction. 
 
Respectfully submitted this 8th day of December, 1995.

MEMORANDUM OF POINT AND AUTHORITIES
I.
INTRODUCTION

As described in the Motion by Defendant Joseph Lyle Menendez for Order
Prohibiting Co-Defendant From Eliciting or Referring to any
Out-Of-Court Statements by Co-Defendant Which Incriminate Defendant
filed  December 15, 1994 ("Motion to Prohibit"), the application of
the Aranda-Bruton rule(1) to the prosecution's previous and pending
proffers of evidence has been the subject of substantial briefing and
argument by the parties.(2)  In the Motion to Prohibit, Lyle Menendez
for the first time formally requested that, in addition to the
prosecution's proposed redactions of proffered statements to comply
with Aranda-Bruton, this Court order co-defendant Erik Menendez to
refrain from eliciting the portions of the alleged out-of-court
statements by Erik Menendez which might tend to incriminate Lyle
Menendez.

In its most recent proffer entitled "People's Supplemental Proffer of
Evidence to be Presented Before a Single Jury" dated December 8, 1994
("Supplemental Proffer"), the prosecution proposes to offer additional
testimony of Craig Cignarelli respecting statements purportedly made
to him by Erik Menendez.(3)  The prosecution further proposes
redaction of all such supplemental statements to delete any reference
to Lyle Menendez.

This brief is to supplement the Motion to Prohibit, and further to
request that this Court preclude the prosecution from eliciting
certain alleged statements by Erik Menendez to Craig Cignarelli which
might prejudice Lyle Menendez in a joint trial.  Specifically, the
prosecution should be precluded from eliciting testimony by Craig
Cignarelli which, by inference, implies that Lyle Menendez killed his
mother.  Similarly, the co-defendant should be prevented from bringing
out testimony on cross-examination which the prosecution could not ask
on direct.  This motion and supplemental brief is intended to present
an illustrative but not exclusive list of examples of such potential
testimony by Mr. Cignarelli.

II.
EXAMPLES OF TESTIMONY THE PROSECUTION SHOULD BE PRECLUDED FROM
ELICITING

Many cases have been cited to this Court in previous briefs regarding
the difficulties encountered in seeking to redact the out-of-court
statements of a defendant which implicate his or her co-defendant. 
See, e.g., People v. Douglas (1991) 234 Cal. App. 3d 273, 285; People
v. Terry (1970) 2 Cal. 3d 362, 284-85; People v. Matola (1968) 259
Cal. App. 2d 686, 692-93; see also, Lee v. Illinois (1986) 476 U.S.
530.  The Supplemental Proffer proposes to introduce the following
redacted testimony by Craig Cignarelli regarding what Erik Menendez
supposedly told him:

"He was unable to shoot his mother and she tried to get away.  After
it looked like his mother was dead, he shot her twice with his gun." 
(Supplemental Proffer, p.3, ll. 3-5.)

The clear inference in this proposed statement is that, after Erik's
mother tried to get away, someone else killed her.  Erik then shot her
after she appeared to be dead.  The "someone else," of course, could
only be Lyle Menendez in the minds of the jury members.  The proposed
redaction thus violates the Aranda-Bruton rule in that the proposed
redaction incriminates the non-declarant.


III.
EXAMPLES OF TESTIMONY THE CO-DEFENDANT SHOULD BE PRECLUDED FROM
ELICITING

The same statement and inference objected to above must not be brought
out by co-defendant.  In her cross-examination of Craig Cignarelli at
the previous trial, counsel for Erik Menendez had the following
colloquy:

Ms. Abramson:  May I have a moment, your Honor?
Q    You first told the story to Detective Zoeller during that
November 17th meeting at Baker's Square, correct?
A    If it was November 17th, yes.
Q    Why don't we -- unless they object, we'll assume it is.  And when
you told him then what Erik had said to you, you told Detective
Zoeller that Erik said that he actually was -- did not shoot his
mother when he walked into the room.  That, although his brother said,
"shoot mom," he couldn't do it.
A    That's right.  He did not say he didn't shoot.
Q    Let's take one line at a time.
A    Okay.  He said he didn't shoot, though.
Q    You told the officers on November 17th that what Erik told you
was:  "Lyle was to shoot my dad, and I was supposed to shoot my
mother."
A    That's correct.
Q    Are you with me so far?
A    Yes.
Q    "We went into the room and Lyle pointed his gun at my dad and
shot him.  He then went over and shot him in the head."
A  That's correct.
Q    "Lyle shot her too?"
A    That's correct.
Q    "After it looked like my mother was dead, I shot her twice with
my gun'?
A     That's correct.  (Reporter's Transcript, p. 7803, l. 3 through
p. 7804, l. 9.)

Obviously the co-defendant cannot be permitted to present this
testimony that the prosecution is precluded from introducing. 
Similarly, the following previous testimony by Mr. Cignarelli
respecting Erik Menendez's statements cannot be pursued by the
co-defendant before a single jury:

The Witness:  He said that he went back outside and his brother was
standing there with two shotguns and said:  'Let's do it.'  And they
walked inside and Lyle was standing -- or Erik went up to the door on
the left, which was slightly open.  And the door on the right, Lyle
went up and put his shoulder against the door on the right.  And Erik
said he looked in, saw his parents sitting on the couch.  And Lyle
sung open the door and shot his father and looked at Erik and said: 
'Shoot mom.'  And Erik said he shot his mom as she was standing up and
yelling."  (Reporter's Transcript, p. 7758, ll.  10-21.)

Another example of testimony which may not be elicited by the
co-defendant is set forth in an affidavit by Detective Zoeller in
support of search warrant number 1542, dated January 24, 1990, which
was obtained in connection with this case.  In that affidavit,
Detective Zoeller states that:

"On November 17, 1989, your affiant interviewed Craig
Cignarelli....Erik stated, 'Lyle and I drove up to the house, opening
the gate and pulled into the driveway.  We unlocked the front door and
walked in.  My parents were in the family room watching television. 
Lyle looked at me and said, 'let's do it!'  We walked outside to the
front of the house and got the guns.  We walked back inside and Lyle
was to shoot my dad and I was supposed to shoot my mother.'

'We went into the room and Lyle pointed his gun at dad and shot him. 
He then went over and shot him in the head.  I was unable to shoot my
mom and she tried to get away.  Lyle shot her too.  After it looked
like my mother was dead, I shot her twice with my gun.'  (Affidavit of
Det. Les Zoeller, p. 3, ll. 7-25.)

Similarly, the co-defendant must not be permitted to inquire into the
following recitation by Detective Zoeller of an alleged statement by
Mr. Cignarelli respecting an alleged statement by Erik Menendez:

"Craig then posed the question, 'What if something were to happen to
Erik in Mexico, would we (the police) be able to find him.'  I/Os
asked what he was referring to.  He said that Erik was scared of Lyle.
 What if Lyle found out that Erik had told of the murder or wanted to
kill Erik for the entire inheritance."  (Beverly Hills Police Report
dated 11/28/89, p. 3 of 3.)



IV.
CONCLUSION

The above examples further illustrate the pitfalls of seeking to
redact the testimony of any witness, and the testimony of Mr.
Cignarelli in particular, in a trial before a single jury.  For all
the reasons set forth herein and in the numerous briefs previously
filed on this issue, defendant Lyle Menendez respectfully requests
that this motion be granted.

3 Statements supposedly made by Erik Menendez to Craig Cignarelli

hearing June 27, 1994.  As noted in the Response by Joseph Lyle
Menendez to People's Proffer of Evidence to be Presented Before a
Single Jury filed June 13, 1994, the prosecution has failed to
identify the exact redactions it proposes with respect to those
alleged statements, making a specific response to that portion of the
proffer relating to Mr. Cignarelli impossible at this time.

SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS
ANGELES

PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PLAINTIFF,

VS.

ERIC GALEN MENENDEZ and JOSEPH LYLE MENENDEZ DEFENDANTS,

Case no: BA 068880

ORDER RE: REQUEST OF ELECTRONIC MEDIA PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA RULES OF
COURT, RULE 980

On October 2, 1995, the Court conducted a hearing pursuant to
California Rules of Court, rule 980 regarding the application of
non-party electronic media organizations Courtroom Television Network
and Radio and Television News Association of Southern California to
record electronically and broadcast the upcoming trial. At that
hearing defendant Joseph Lyle Menendez stated his opposition to the
application, defendant Erik Galen

Menendez took no position, and the People stated their support for the
application. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court granted the
request of non-party applications to present a written memorandum in
support of their application.

Having considered the memoranda filed on this issue as well as the
oral argument, the court, in the interests of justice, denies the
application to record electronically and broadcast the upcoming trial.
The Court concludes that denial of this application will protect the
rights of the parties, the dignity of the Court and assure the orderly
conduct of the proceedings.

The Court has concluded that film and electronic media coverage of the
upcoming trial will substantially increase the risk that jurors will
be exposed, whether intentionally or inadvertently, to information and
commentary about this case outside of the courtroom. Such exposure has
the potential of prejudicing the rights of the parties to a fair trial
and necessitating lengthy hearings to investigate the nature of the
exposure and the impact on the juror. Such hearings would disrupt the
orderly conduct of the trial.

Circumstances have changed considerably since the first trial. The
most obvious difference is that there was a first trial. As the Court
and counsel learned from the just completed voir dire, almost all
potential jurors had substantial exposure to the electronic media
coverage during the first trial. The visual images from television
coverage of the first trial remained in the minds of many potential
jurors long after memories of details had faded. The impact of the
electronic media coverage of the first trial was profound and
pervasive.

Counsel for non-party applicants concede in their memorandum that
"this case has been the focus of a significant amount of public
attention. . . . The public interest . . . is just as strong with
respect to the second trial." (Memorandum, page 3). The Court
concludes that the enduring intensity of interest in this case
immeasurably increases the likelihood that jurors will be exposed to
potentially prejudicial electronic media coverage about this case
outside the courtroom. (1)

Therefore, the application pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule
980 is denied.

/s/

Judge Stanley M. Weisberg.

NOTES

(1) Although the Court is concerned that certain witnesses, as stated
by counsel for defendant Joseph Lyle Menendez, will be inhibited from
testifying due to the electronic media coverage of the upcoming trial,
the Court has not been presented with sufficient information about
them to base this decision on that representation. Obviously, if
witnesses were to be materially affected by such coverage, the parties
would be denied the right to a fair trial.

<P> In this three-day hearing, lawyers argued over what evidence the prosecution must turn over to the defense. Prosecutors are obliged to provide the defendants any evidence they consider using in a trial as well as any information that might help the defense side. Defendant Timothy McVeigh's attorney, Stephen Jones, asked for details on negotiations between authorities and Michael Fortier, a former associate of McVeigh's who is expected to testify for the government in exchange for a plea agreement. Jones contended that Fortier changed his story as part of deal to avoid trial.</P>

            THE COURT:  Please be seated.

            Good morning.  We're here in 96-CR-68, United States

   vs. Timothy James McVeigh and Terry Lynn Nichols for a hearing

            MR. HARTZLER:  Good morning, your Honor.

            MR. HARTZLER:  Joseph Hartzler along with Larry

   Mackey, Sean Connelly, Vicki Behenna, Scott Mendeloff, and Beth

   Wilkinson.

            THE COURT:  And for Mr. McVeigh?

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, Stephen Jones for McVeigh.  To

   my right, Ms. Merritt, Ms. Wyatt, Mr. Nigh; and Mr. McVeigh is

   present in person.

            THE COURT:  Good morning.

            For Mr. Nichols?

            MR. WOODS:  Good morning, your Honor.  Ron Woods for

   Mr. Nichols.  To my left is Reid Neureiter and Adam

   Thurschwell.  We have the defendant Terry Nichols present.

   Lead counsel, Mike Tigar, had a prior commitment to teach in

   France this week.

            THE COURT:  Yes.  And, Mr. Nichols, as I understand

   it, you've agreed that we can continue without him for purposes

   of these hearings.

            THE DEFENDANT NICHOLS:  Yes, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.

            Now, there are -- a lot of paper has been filed in

   connection with these matters; and my suggestion with respect

   to our sequence of hearing these matters is that we start out

   with the Rule 16, what's been described as "the narrowed Rule



                                                                           4



   16 motion"; and I think that's going to take some time item by

   item.  I reviewed the Government's response as well as the

   motion; and unless something has happened since the last papers

   filed, I assume we're going to discuss those item by item.

            Then there is a discovery motion filed on behalf of

   Mr. Nichols that raises four matters that we'll consider next.

            Then there is a request, again called "the narrowed

   request for expert witness discovery."

            Then there is a hearing on a motion to compel

   production of exculpatory evidence, Brady material, part of

   which may have to be taken in chambers.

            I have directed that notice be given that we would at

   9:00 tomorrow morning hear the Government's proposed criteria

   for admission to closed circuit televised proceedings and this

   related collateral matter, 96-X-134, petition for admission of

   media to closed circuit television proceedings.  We'll do --

   wherever we are in this sequence, we'll interrupt it to do that

   so that the lawyers for the media will have an opportunity to

   appear on the 96-X-134.

            Then at some point, I also need to meet with counsel

   for the Government and for Mr. McVeigh with respect to the

   technical aspects of closed circuit television -- televised

   proceedings and matters that relate to the first trial.

            So that's what I suggest.  Now, I don't know whether

   you've met and made your own suggestions, but if there is no



                                                                           5



   disagreement, that's how I'd propose to proceed.

            MR. JONES:  I don't have a disagreement with it.  That

   would be fine.

            I would like to ask -- I wasn't quite sure where you

   were going to hear the matters with respect to our motion on

   national security.

            THE COURT:  Well, I consider that to be under the

   general heading of the exculpatory evidence, and that's the

   portion of it that I think requires an in-chambers meeting with

   counsel.

            So given that, I'm ready to start on the narrowed Rule

   16.

            Ms. Wilkinson?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, the Government has one

   request.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MS. WILKINSON:  When we came to court this morning,

   Mr. Jones brought in a variety of charts and gave us copies of

   those charts.  We would object to those being introduced during

   this discovery hearing and ask that the Court review copies of

   those charts prior to Mr. Jones being permitted to use them

   during this hearing, either during the Rule 16, the

   exculpatory, or any other portion of the hearing.

            THE COURT:  Well, are there small ones that I can look

   at before we --



                                                                           6



            MR. JONES:  Well, there is a court's copy, yes, sir.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.  Well, I suggest we take those up at

   the time that Mr. Jones thinks they're relevant.

            MR. JONES:  A few of them, your Honor, relate in

   general to the Rule 16 matter, some preliminary remarks I have

   with respect to discovery.

            I can, if the Court will give me just a second here --

            Your Honor, I believe the ones that I'm handing to the

   Court now would come up during the discussion of Rule 16 and

   the presentation with respect to the methodology.

            THE COURT:  Well, D is something I've already seen,

   isn't it?  Or is this something different from Mr.Lloyd?

            MR. JONES:  It's been filed, your Honor.  It's dated

   November 10.

            THE COURT:  I've already seen it.

            MR. JONES:  It's to be used or intended to be used

   during the oral argument to highlight certain -- I'm sorry.

   Mr. Wyatt says the November 10 letter hasn't been filed yet.

   It's attached to --

            THE COURT:  Well, why do these have to be blowups?

            MR. JONES:  For ease of discussion, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  I can read them right here.

            MR. JONES:  Sure.  Ease of discussion of the Court and

   to the Government and to Mr. Tigar and ourselves.

            THE COURT:  Well, we'll deal with them as they come up



                                                                           7



   one at a time, but I don't see the need for the blowups.

            I do have a question, actually, before we start.

            Ms. Wilkinson, you, I think -- the glossary that you

   submitted which is very helpful except with respect to one item

   and that is 1C "(potential exhibit)."  This is a "large 1A."  I

   think I understand what 1A is, but is a large 1A a larger

   category?  What does the adjective describe?

            MS. WILKINSON:  In this case, your Honor, there isn't

   much of a difference between what's listed on the 1A and the 1C

   list other than the volume.  1A has many more items.  1A and

   1C's are the FBI designators for evidence or information or

   documents collected that don't normally need a chain of

   custody, so they're paper documents.

            In this case, the 1C's, I believe there is 685 -- I

   can't remember -- and Mr. McVeigh's counsel has seen all of

   those.

            THE COURT:  So "large" means a greater number of the

   same type of thing?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Correct.

            THE COURT:  Which may or may not become exhibits,

   then.  Is that correct?

            MS. WILKINSON:  That's right, your Honor.  Those that

   we believe will be exhibits at that time, we have already

   provided copies to counsel months ago, but they've also

   reviewed all of the 1C's the Government has.



                                                                           8



            THE COURT:  Okay.  So 1A are the things that are

   likely to be exhibits and that are also not 1B in the sense

   that they're not big --

            MS. WILKINSON:  1B stands normally for "bulky."  1C is

   other things we've collected.  Polygraph information in the

   1A's:  Obviously, that information, evidence is not admissible;

   but we keep track of it through the 1A system, other things

   like that.

            THE COURT:  I see.  Thank you.  That helps.

            All right.  Mr. Jones?

            MR. JONES:  Thank you, your Honor.

            May it please the Court, before going directly into

   the Rule 16, I would like to make just a few very preliminary

   remarks about the scope of the discovery issue and the -- what

   has transpired since the last time we were in court with

   respect to hearing it and then some information that we have

   put together which will also be included in the status report

   we will file with the Court, but I take just a moment now in

   the full representation of my client to put it on the record

   with respect to the types of problems that the counsel on all

   three sides have faced in this case.

            At the last time, I mentioned to the Court on the

   public record -- and I do so again today -- two points that I

   think can never be overstated.  There is no question but that

   this is a massive, unprecedented case.  Certainly, there have



                                                                           9



   been large criminal investigations in the history of the United

   States commanding the full resources of the FBI and other

   agencies.

            But this case perhaps is unique in itself because it

   combines not only a large number of deaths -- 168 -- the

   substantial destruction of several blocks in a downtown major

   metropolitan city, an unprecedented number of injuries, a truly

   significant amount of just physical debris, not to mention

   perhaps 100,000, if not more, individual items of -- if not

   evidence, at least tangible objects that had to be reviewed by

   someone.  That information had to be collated, assembled first

   by the prosecution and given to the defense.

            And the Government has repeatedly said to the Court

   that while it's ready for trial, it is also continuing the

   investigation.  So who knows when the investigation may end and

   at what stage?

            So we recognize that when it may be that it seems that

   we are being unduly harsh or critical to the Government in some

   of these problems, I have to first recognize, as I do candidly,

   that this is an unusual case with unusual problems in

   collecting and assembling and making the information available

   to us.

            The second thing that I want to say again is that

   Linda Vernon of the FBI, who has sort of been in charge of the

   physical assembling and distribution of this evidence, has been



                                                                           10



   very helpful, very professional in all of the things that she

   has done in this case.  And, frankly, although there are

   differences between ourselves and Mr. Hartzler and

   Ms. Wilkinson and the others on the Government side, there has

   been in some areas extraordinary cooperation and response to

   letters and inquiries that we have had.  And Mr. Mackey

   continues to work on the phone problems -- or record of phone

   call problems.

            So when I speak, as I hope to do later today, about

   some of the unresolved issues, I do it without rancor and I do

   it with full recognition of what I just said.

            I think also that it sometimes is forgotten that in

   addition to the case of United States vs. Timothy McVeigh in

   which the parties are the Government, ourselves, and Mr. Tigar

   on behalf of Mr. Nichols, we have counted up 61 other

   proceedings that have interfered -- if I may use that term in a

   neutral setting -- with the preparation and investigation of

   this case.  Those 61 issues include 14 other miscellaneous

   cases, 7 appeals, 5 interventions by the victims, and I believe

   it's 56 separate -- I'm sorry -- 36 separate media motions, for

   a grand total of 61 separate proceedings that I count.  And

   then it's possible that I may have overlooked some, because I

   know Mr. Tigar's office was involved in 1 or 2.

            Those 61 proceedings have involved an inordinate

   amount of time of the Court and all of us; and to the extent



                                                                           11



   they impact upon discovery, they are a diversion from the

   principal function here, which is to get this case ready for

   trial.

            I also made it clear, I think, in our pleadings and

   what I have said before that the defense in this case is "not

   guilty"; that we will seek to challenge the Government's

   evidence and the allegations of the grand jury; that we

   certainly will contend that there is a John Doe 2 and maybe 3,

   4 and 5, there are multiple Ryder trucks, and that our client

   is not guilty.

            And with one or two exceptions, each and every thing

   in the Government's case will be challenged.

            I have also indicated to the Court that I see the case

   from the standpoint of the trial and the discovery issues as

   breaking down essentially into five large areas, which for the

   sake of organization and clarity to follow are what I think are

   the five major thrusts of the indictment and the case that we

   will be called upon to defend against.  Those include the

   eyewitness identifications alleged at Junction City and the

   writing -- renting of the Ryder truck in which the Government

   alleges that our client was Robert Kling.  The forensic

   evidence from the lab would be the second one.  The third would

   be the proffered testimony of Michael and Laurie Fortier which

   presumably will come at the trial.  The fourth will be the

   issue of the arrest of Mr. McVeigh by Trooper Hanger, what I've



                                                                           12



   called the proximity issue.  And the fifth will be the issue

   raised by Government's pleadings of Mr. McVeigh's motives

   insofar as it relates to Waco and perhaps other incidents.

            So when we look at the discovery issues and we prepare

   for trial, we look generally to those five areas.

            The Government has produced to us 25,000 witness

   statements and still counting.  The index alone to those

   statements is 580 pages by the most recent count.  We are told

   that the 1A list consists of 15,000 items.  The index to that,

   which covers only 6,000 items -- those being the 6,000 the

   Government thinks that we are entitled to know the existence

   of -- I believe covers 680 pages.

            There is a 1B index which exceeds 440 pages and covers

   over 5,000 items.  There are 350 audio cassette tapes, 500

   video cassette tapes, and approximately 160,000 sheets of paper

   on top of the 25,000 witness statements.

            In organizing the material, I think the Court is

   probably less interested in what our dispute is than what our

   proposed resolution of it is.  And the Court has suggested that

   we go through each of these items individually, and I propose

   to do that; but there are certain items that cut across each of

   these five areas and each of the four motions or five motions;

   and rather than address each of them in turn, I would just

   briefly, if I may, address them now and simply say that they

   follow throughout these matters.



                                                                           13



            Part of the problem has been with the delayed

   production of the 302's.  There is an exhibit which I believe

   is Exhibit F, which is one of the documents that I handed to

   the Court and another exhibit -- it's Exhibit F.

            If I might ask Mr. Wyatt, is this the complete

   exhibit, or only the ones that are on the blowup?

       (Discussion off the record between Mr. Jones and Mr. Wyatt)

            MR. JONES:  The Government has been giving us 302's;

   and part of the problem that we have had, quite seriously, your

   Honor, is significant delayed production from the date of

   transcription to the date it's given to us.  So we simply took

   the most recent three or four productions and took what we

   considered to be the significant 302's, leaving aside those

   that aren't significant; and we made a chart of seven columns,

   the first column being the 302 number, the second being a very

   cryptic description of what the item is and who it may relate

   to.  The third is the investigation date, which is the date

   shown on the 302 that the incident described in the 302

   occurred.

            For example, at the very first -- let's take the

   second one.  That particular witness was interviewed on July 1,

   1995, in 302 No. 16217.  The dictation date is the date from

   the 302 that it shows that the FBI agent -- and usually, it's

   an FBI agent -- dictated the result of the interview.  The

   transcription date is the date it was transcribed by the FBI



                                                                           14



   typist and the production date is the date we got it.

            And the final column is the number of days from the

   transcription to the production, not the number of days from

   the interview and not the number of days from the

   transcription -- I'm sorry -- from the dictation but the actual

   number of days from the date it was transcribed and presumably

   in hard copy to the date we got it.

            And as this chart shows, the average time is almost

   500 days.

            Now, the Government's answer to that is, well, we give

   it to the defense when we, the prosecution, gets it.  And then

   that may be so; but the FBI is part of the prosecution and it's

   a little difficult for me to understand how these obvious

   important 302's involving, as the Court can see -- some of

   these are extremely critical witnesses to the defense.  Some of

   them involve material very helpful to the defense.  Others are

   perhaps incriminating of the defense case; and we have

   production delays not of 50 days, not of 6 months or even a

   year, but over a year.

            That is something that we ask the Court to address;

   and the specific remedy that we ask for as it applies to

   whether it's Brady or Rule 16 or methodology is for the Court

   to set a date -- and I don't care when that date is; but let's

   just take as an example December 1 -- that all 302's which are

   the subject of an investigation before November 15 have to be



                                                                           15



   given to the defense on December 1; all 302's from November 1

   to December 1 have to be given to us by December 15; all from

   December 15 to January 1 have to be given to us by January 15,

   and so on, down to, including those last few days before trial,

   because these delays are unconscionable and they are delaying

   the case going to trial, because it is difficult for us to go

   out and interview witnesses, to plan exhibits, to plan

   cross-examination and trial when we are still getting a year

   and a half later 302's from say, Trooper Hanger, who arrested

   Mr. McVeigh, or James Rosencrans or Marife's father or any of

   these people.

            That, we believe, has to be addressed, and that is one

   of the most serious problems.  It's not a question of whether

   we get them, which is a different issue.  It's a question of

   when we get them.

            The second issue has to do with the description of

   what we get.

            We submitted to the Court a sealed appendix.  And I'll

   ask Mr. Wyatt if he would find it so I can at least visually

   show it to the Court and the Court will know which one I'm

   referring to, which had a large number of colored tabs.  And

   behind Tabs, I believe, B, C, D and X, are graphic examples:

   Docket entry 1966, which looks like this.

            If the Court will look at -- we have copies here just

   of the pages that I'm going to refer to.  Exhibit D and Exhibit



                                                                           16



   X, we have described.  And I know the Court has read this

   before, but there is so much material the Court may not have

   understood fully its significance to us of how an item is

   described on the master Q and K list, which is the list of

   questioned documents -- I shouldn't say documents -- questioned

   items and known items, which the FBI laboratory or some other

   laboratory works -- how those same items are described on the

   1A, 1B list, and then the notes.

            It's a mishmash.  It's simply not possible for us to

   take the documents the Government gives us and consistently on

   material items match up and follow those items from the lab --

   or rather from where they came from to the lab to the material

   we receive.  And we have taken again representative samples,

   not the worst samples, not the best samples, but just

   representative samples across the board.

            The relief we ask is this: that the Court enter an

   order requiring the Government and in cooperation with the

   defense -- we'll be glad to sit down with them -- to make a

   list that accurately and fully describes as to the originating

   source whether it comes from Trooper Hanger or Charlie Brown or

   the Daylight Motel in Enid, Oklahoma, and not the name of the

   FBI agent that has it.  That doesn't mean anything to us.  If

   you say, "Special Agent John Smith," that means absolutely

   nothing.  Where did Mr. Smith get it from?

            That's just one example.  The inconsistency in the way



                                                                           17



   items are described as they go through the laboratory.

            Now, that's not something that we can solve ourselves,

   unless the Government lays everything out on a table -- and

   it's going to take a very large table and a large room -- and

   we will make our list.  And we'll go through it one by one and

   make the list.

            But I suspect that in a week's time, if the Court

   orders it, that the Government and the defense working

   together, because after all, this is material in their

   possession which they got and we didn't get it.  We don't have

   it in our possession.  Some of it we have copies of.  But when

   you're talking about 50- or 60,000 items -- and that's a

   conservative number -- and you don't have a master list to

   follow, it is impossible.

            So the relief that we ask of the Court is to order the

   parties, with the Government taking the lead, to prepare a 1A

   list of those items that they think we're entitled to receive

   or view.

            Now, I want to advise the Court that on the 1A items,

   the Government says, Well, a lot of those items are things that

   you're not entitled to see.  And I think that's true, certainly

   at this point.  I mean a substantial number of them are FBI

   agent field notes where they handwrite the note.  And I'm not

   arguing that now.

            But what I am arguing is there are some items in the



                                                                           18



   1A, and in this case, the Government has admitted to us --

   admit perhaps is a poor choice of words -- they have advised us

   that the traditional distinction that the FBI makes between

   items that are 1A and 1B is largely lost in this case,

   considering how the items came in, the quickness with which

   they came in, and the mere size of them.

            But if we just start with those 6,000 items that the

   Government thinks that we are entitled to view under 1A, we

   want a list of them, what they are precisely.  And just let me

   take the most recent, dramatic example of how misleading this

   is and the fact that I believe that the Government has such a

   list but we don't.

            Here is a letter dated November 12 -- we're not using

   these exhibits so much as just aids to the Court, your Honor.

   This letter is in response to a letter that I wrote on

   October 8, and so five weeks later I get the response.  And I

   don't really have a complaint about the five weeks.  I can

   understand there might be a problem.  This letter was written

   because of an article that appeared in a newspaper which

   purported to report the discovery of a very important piece of

   evidence, a piece of evidence that as far as I could tell was

   in no way mentioned in the 302's.

            So I wrote the Government and I made reference to and

   Ms. Wilkinson accurately summarized this in my letter:  I asked

   her for the identification of the item that was recovered in



                                                                           19



   downtown Oklahoma City.  She responds they did recover it; and

   then she says -- and I think I can read this part with a minor

   exception:  "The description for the item is contained on your

   1B inventory list as 1B78, Item 16-26, described as 'numerous

   fragments.'"

            Well, considering what this item is, your Honor -- and

   I think the Court can see what it is and understand its

   significance -- and I can tell you that its significance is

   very great -- there is no way in God's world that I would know

   that that item is to be found in numerous fragments as 16-26 on

   1B78.

            Now, they obviously knew what that item was; so why

   they didn't just simply say Item 16-26 is blank to blank and I

   would have known instantly what it was.

            But then she goes on to say, "The item is also listed

   on your master Q inventory list as Q2323 described as

   miscellaneous debris."

            It isn't miscellaneous debris.  Miscellaneous debris

   is something that is miscellaneous debris.  This is a specific

   item that relates to a specific vehicle that is specifically

   important in this case.

            There are hundreds of examples like that.  We cannot

   prepare for trial under that state of the discovery.  Had this

   article not appeared in the newspaper, I would have never known

   about it; that it had been recovered, much less where it was



                                                                           20



   recovered from.  And as I say, that's just one example.

            If I might have just a moment to refer to my notes,

   your Honor.

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MR. JONES:  Our position, then, is that, first, there

   is an unreasonable and unconscionable delay in the production

   of 302's, in which the Court must intervene and set some

   deadline for in order to get this case ready for trial.  We

   have the duty to investigate the facts.  Hopefully, we'd like

   to investigate them only once.

            Secondly, there are numerous errors in the 1B and the

   Q and A which are inaccurate and misleading and that must be

   addressed.

            Another thing that the Government does -- and this one

   may not be done deliberately in the sense of misleading -- the

   Government each month has furnished us lists; and as they

   discover errors in the previous lists, they have made changes

   in the lists.  But the changes that they make are not

   noticeable to us; so when we get a new index each month, if an

   item on page 40 has been changed, we don't have any way of

   knowing that.

            So there has to be some mechanism beginning at some

   point.  I mean we can't go back and put the toothpaste back in

   the tube on that portion that's been squeezed out.  When the

   Government finds an error or -- and it's not always an error;



                                                                           21



   sometimes it's simply an omission or an admission and in some

   cases a deletion -- that needs to be addressed and indicated in

   such a way that we fully understand and are made aware of it.

            The new indexes that are presented to us, as we

   understand it, is only to add additional items.

            Last night, the Government delivered to us after 4:00

   a substantial amount of new material, material that we have

   asked for since last October; and based upon the letter that

   accompanied it, it would appear that many of these items again

   go back to April, May, and June of 1995 --

            MS. WILKINSON:  Mr. Jones, can you tell me what letter

   are you referring to?

            MR. JONES:  Sure.  I'm sorry.  It's the one dated

   November 12.

            Last time when I spoke with the Court on this issue, I

   brought in the eight boxes we had received then and represented

   to the Court that the pattern of Government production in these

   matters is that on the eve of the day of decision when the

   Court will hear our argument to suddenly change the landscape

   by a massive compliance with something that's been asked for

   for a year, which then confuses the issue because the

   Government can then say, Well, we've given it to them.  Well,

   of course they have, a year and a half after the incident and

   in some cases a year after it's been requested.

            I think the Court needs to address that issue.



                                                                           22



            That contains the summary of the items that I

   represent to the Court go through and cut through all of these

   various motions.  And as the Court knows, because we previously

   submitted Mr. McVeigh's reply to response of the United States

   Government to McVeigh's discovery motions beginning on 10,

   we -- under the heading "The Government Cannot Bury Evidence,"

   we cited to the Court the case law from those cases which have

   discussed the case in massive paper cases, what is the

   Government's duty and obligation to organize it in a fashion

   that it can be used and understood.  And I simply refer the

   Court to the Ollison case and the Turkish case and the other

   cases cited there.

            With respect to the narrowed 16 motion, if I may with

   the Court's permission, I wonder if I could ask leave of the

   Court to have Mr. Wyatt join me at the podium, because he is

   the person on the defense team most -- or charged with the

   responsibility to organize, collect, and analyze the evidence;

   and I want to be sure that as I make representations to the

   Court; that I'm not in error.

            I'll be speaking, but he'll be --

            THE COURT:  Yeah, we'll do that.  But before we do it,

   I think the Government should have an opportunity to respond to

   your general observations; and I have this to ask of you,

   Mr. Jones, and that is you began this statement with your

   intention to challenge everything and of course provide a



                                                                           23



   vigorous defense in the case; but I would anticipate and expect

   that with the kind of discovery involved here and recognizing

   the reciprocity that is also due to the Government by you under

   Rule 16 that there will be a time when we -- if it takes me,

   I'll be there -- should have some type of conference with

   regard to what -- and of course, Mr. McVeigh -- what is -- what

   are the possibilities of stipulations with respect to at least

   foundation and some of these admissibility, authentication

   issues, and so forth, to provide some trial efficiency.

            MR. JONES:  I will -- do you wish for me to respond?

            THE COURT:  Yes.  I mean, I have been assuming that

   you're going to be prepared to do that at some time before

   trial.

            MR. JONES:  Well, I will address that issue frankly

   and candid, as I know the Court will want me to do.

            I would like to do that; but I'm increasingly

   skeptical that it's in the best interest of Mr. McVeigh to do

   it, and I will tell the Court why.  I think it's possible it's

   not too late to change the history of discovery problems in

   this case; but unless I am satisfied, your Honor -- and I think

   it's the duty of the Government to present to us in a form that

   we can use it, study it, analyze it, verify it, and check it

   ourselves -- I don't see how in good faith I can stipulate to

   something.

            THE COURT:  Well, I wouldn't be asking you to



                                                                           24



   stipulate to anything that you're not absolutely confident can

   be proved at trial through the ordinary method, certainly.  I'm

   not asking you to cut any corners with respect to it.

            MR. JONES:  That's fine.  And I have advised both

   Mr. Hartzler and Mr. Mackey when we have discussed this matter

   both in correspondence and face to face when we have met, and I

   told them quite frankly -- and I don't think they will dispute

   it -- that I said there will come a time when you will want me

   to stipulate -- and I said this early -- and I tell you

   gentlemen, looking you in the eye, that if you hold back, you

   confuse, you withhold, you give us stuff that we cannot use,

   I'm not going to sign the stipulation.  And I repeated that as

   recently as two months ago in a letter.

            I would like to stipulate.  Otherwise, it's a trial

   without ending, so to speak, which is certainly not my desire.

   But I've been burned twice before on stipulations with the

   Government, and I don't think it's appropriate -- not in this

   case -- to discuss those publicly; and so I'm once burned,

   twice shy.

            I know that one of the matters we're working on are

   these telephone records that the Government has indicated

   they'd like a stipulation.  But as of today, a year and a half

   later, we don't have a complete set, even of the summary, so we

   can then check the summary against the raw data.

            Now, Mr. Mackey has diligently been working on that,



                                                                           25



   and I recognize the mammoth task that's involved; but here's

   what troubles me -- I mean, the Court has invited me to speak:

   I get a little tired of reading in the newspaper that the

   Government is ready to go to trial.  The Government isn't ready

   to go to trial.  That's a myth.  If they're ready to go to

   trial, where are the rest of these exhibits, where are the rest

   of the 302's, where are the rest of the lab reports?  They're

   not ready.  If they're ready and they've got them, why don't we

   have them.  And if they don't have them, then they're not

   ready.  And they're sure not ready to ask me for stipulations,

   because I haven't even seen the raw data of what they're asking

   me to stipulate.  The first meeting we had on the phone records

   was yesterday or Monday.

            So this kind of posturing that we're ready for

   trial -- this case isn't ready for trial; and certainly,

   they're not ready.  If they are, then they've just been sitting

   on the material that the Court expects them to have given us

   months ago.

            And I'm not saying that critically.  I understand the

   need to make public statements, given the nature of this case.

   And I do compliment Mr. Mackey on it.  But I -- and the Court

   may overrule me and the Court may tell me I'm wrong and the

   Court may tell me to shut up and sit down; and I will do

   everything that the Court tells me to; but before I stipulate,

   I want accurate indexes, I want this 302 delayed production



                                                                           26



   ended, I want to know where the raw data is, and I want to see

   that material and have time to study it, not a weekend.  I

   don't want to get a letter on Thursday and say we expect you to

   stipulate in seven days.

            THE COURT:  Well, let me make it clear.  What I have

   in mind is that there be a stipulations conference at some

   point when we're ready for it and with Mr. McVeigh present, of

   course, who can participate in it.

            But I didn't mean to suggest anything beyond that,

   certainly not that stipulation become some sort of bargaining

   element.  I'm just talking about it as a procedural efficiency

   in the presentation of evidence.

            Well, Ms. Wilkinson, do you or someone on behalf of

   the Government wish to respond to these general comments from

   Mr. Jones?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, we appreciate Mr. Jones'

   acknowledgement at the beginning of his presentation about the

   volume of material produced in this case; but as I was

   listening to his list of problems or disputes, I could not help

   but think that no good deed goes unpunished.

            When Mr. Jones tells you that he has just received,

   last night information that the Government had since the case

   began, what he fails to tell you is that that information is



                                                                           27



   polygraph information and post-April 19 surveillance

   information, information that clearly under the law the defense

   is not entitled to but nevertheless, we've listed on the 1A

   inventory and we have provided to Mr. Jones.  And as he shows

   you in his own pleading in Exhibit B, there is a letter to me

   from one of his co-counsels that states we have been providing

   them regular lists of the 1A inventory and advising them in

   writing each month that if they wanted any of these items, all

   they had to do was request those items and we would make

   copies.  So they have had notice of this information; and it

   was only, I believe, in September or August that they wrote and

   specifically said that they saw it listed on the 1A inventory

   and the information was provided.

            As to -- so as to Mr. Jones' request that we furnish

   an index of these items, we have been doing that and we have

   been doing that since January.

            As to his complaint that the index is not complete, I

   understand his frustration with that; but what I can tell you

   is the index that we are providing -- the indices that we are

   providing to him are the only indices that we possess.  Those

   indices were made, as you might imagine, when agents went out

   right after the bombing and seized evidence.  They collected a

   lot of evidence at the scene and they described it, as

   Mr. Jones described for you, as miscellaneous fragments or

   metal fragments; and that is why we set up the procedure.  And



                                                                           28



   Rule 16 provides a procedure for the defense themselves to

   review all of that evidence.

            I understand that he's frustrated that a bag of

   different metal fragments was not identified by each piece.

            THE COURT:  Well, but with respect to the item in

   question as revealed in this letter, surely somebody on your

   side noted that and noted that it in and of itself had perhaps

   significance.

            MS. WILKINSON:  We did, your Honor; and that was

   months later.  After reviewing photographs of the scene, we

   noticed that metal piece.  We went back and looked through all

   those fragments just like the defense does when they come to

   look through the evidence and found it.

            But Mr. Jones is incorrect when he said he was not

   notified of that, because on August 2 the Government provided

   expert witness summaries.  And in those expert witness

   summaries we had an expert named Charles Hurd, who talks about

   that piece of evidence and talks about how that evidence fits

   the vehicle that we're discussing.

            So since August, Mr. Jones has had no notice about

   that particular item.

            But I use that to point out that when you talk about

   these indices, I believe it's impractical to suggest that the

   Government go back and review all these items and provide

   enhanced descriptions.  That, I believe, is the purpose of Rule



                                                                           29



   16, to allow the defense to do their own review of the physical

   evidence; and if Mr. Jones and his team would like to come and

   look at evidence one more time, we'd be happy to provide a room

   for them to inspect the evidence once again.

            THE COURT:  You know, it seems to me we have to

   divide:  Rule 16 covers basically two things.  One is the

   Government's evidence.  And of course, that is important for

   you to have ready to go and for the defense to know, as is

   consistent with the criteria in Rule 16, what it is.

            Then there is that part of Rule 16 that requires

   matters which may be material to the defense, a different

   category.  And I am concerned in reviewing your responses to

   the narrowed Rule 16 when it will be that all of the 302's to a

   given time have been collected and produced.  So it's been

   ongoing month by month, but we've got to set some dates and

   some time limits.

            MS. WILKINSON:  May I address that, your Honor?

            THE COURT:  Please.

            MS. WILKINSON:  As of October 31, which is the last

   time we made production, we produced 16,442 302's and 8,833

   inserts.  That is 98 percent of the 302's that the Government

   has to date.  So we are prepared to provide those remaining

   302's that are in our possession by December 15 or whatever

   date the Court and the defense and the Government agree to; but

   we must remember that the Government's investigation is



                                                                           30



   ongoing, and that is due to several factors.

            THE COURT:  That's a different issue, though.  And I

   think Mr. Jones addressed it; that is, that there be a time set

   for the production of that which has been accomplished to a

   given date, so that December 15 for what's been done by

   November 15 or whatever.  Then, of course, as new activity

   results in new reportage, that can be done as it comes in; but

   I think it is imperative that, you know, when you've got

   2 percent roughly out there now, that relates, I take it, to

   something before today.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Well, it depends, your Honor.  There

   is a wide variety of categories of 302's that we turn over.

   Many of them, for example, are the review of the prison tapes

   of Mr. Nichols.  So that is going to be ongoing.

            Some of them are leads that are sent out to other

   offices.  And as I have explained, since those do come back

   within the month that the lead is sent out, the investigation

   is conducted and the 302 is generated and then sent back into

   our system.  But I believe that the Government can abide by, I

   think, what the Court is requesting, is that we provide all of

   the historical 302's by December 15, and that is anything that

   we started before November 1, the interview was conducted

   before November 1, we can provide those by December 15.  That

   is not a problem.

            However, anything else that's ongoing, we just want to



                                                                           31



   advise the Court we're going to continue to follow up.  For

   example, Mr. Jones has provided reciprocal discovery to us to a

   certain limited extent; and when we read his interviews of

   certain witnesses, that sometimes generates additional

   investigation on our part.

            THE COURT:  Yes.  I understand that.  But you know,

   what we have to do is to say, all right, this is the evidence

   that the Government is relying on to prove these charges at

   trial and get on with it.

            MS. WILKINSON:  We're prepared to do that, your Honor.

   I would point out that I believe we'll be ready to do that by

   December 15, other than the newly generated 302's or

   investigation, if that would satisfy the Court as to the

   production of those reports.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I believe that addresses Mr. Jones'

   delay in production, which was his first item that he raised.

            The second was the description.  I would like to use

   another example, your Honor.  There was an inquiry by the

   defense for an item that the media mentioned, a piece of paper

   that was recovered in Mr. Nichols' trash.  We had found that

   piece of paper.  It had been identified generally as documents

   coming from Mr. Nichols' trash on the 1B list.  Mr. Jones wrote

   to us and asked about that.  We identified it.  We have

   characterized it as something more than a piece of paper from



                                                                           32



   the trash; however, I'm not sure that the defense would agree

   with that characterization.

            So in terms of going back and further identifying the

   evidence that we have collected, the problem with having us

   come up with these descriptions is the defense does not always

   agree with our description, or we don't, as they say, have a

   complete enough description of those items.  It seems to me if

   we go back and try and re-create a new list and add a

   description, there are going to be further disputes with the

   defense over whether we properly characterized a certain item

   of evidence.

            As to identifying where that evidence came, again,

   they have all the information that we have.  When it says it

   came from Agent Smith at the bombing crime scene, that's all

   the documentation that we have about where it came from.  Now,

   we can interview Agent Smith and find out where he found it.

   That's usually contained on the 302 that he writes up about

   seizing that piece of evidence.  I think we pointed this out

   last time, that when you have a piece of evidence that's listed

   on the 1B list, let's say the rear axle that was found, the

   agent who seized that, there is also a 302 that says where that

   item of evidence was seized and it's identified through the 1B

   number.

            So that information is already within the defense's

   custody.  We've already turned over those type of documents.



                                                                           33



            If, your Honor, there are specific questions about

   certain items of evidence that the defense has, obviously we

   have always been available and we will continue to be available

   to answer questions and to research certain items; but to order

   us to go back and create new lists which we don't have -- I

   believe Mr. Jones suggested that we do have the list, and we

   don't -- would be incredibly burdensome for us for those items

   that we don't intend to introduce at trial.  And as you know,

   we have turned over everything in this investigation.  A very

   small percentage of that will actually be introduced at trial.

            So it seems to me a better avenue would be to talk

   about exchanging an exhibit list, because that -- those are the

   items the defense really cares about in terms of preparing for

   trial.  And instead of us creating an entire list redescribing

   everything for them, perhaps we could discuss exchanging draft

   exhibit lists with the clear understanding that this is subject

   to change, we're going to be constantly updating it; and then

   the defense would at least have an idea of what items we intend

   to introduce.

            THE COURT:  Well, I -- that's exactly the approach

   that I think is appropriate; that we be looking at a time when

   exhibit lists will be prepared; and the exhibit lists will have

   descriptions of the items that are numbered in the list, so

   that gets us down, as I said, to, you know, what is going to be

   relied on at trial.  That doesn't mean that these other things



                                                                           34



   might not be significant in some fashion, but they're

   secondary, I think, to the time schedule that we must address

   here.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Perhaps to assist the defense further,

   your Honor, and for our own purposes on the exhibit list, we

   could put our potential Government's exhibit number, the 1B

   number and the lab number, which is the Q number or the K

   number, and that way the defense will know that item, have it

   identified three different ways.

            THE COURT:  Cross-referenced.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, sir.  They can go back to their,

   you know, work product that they've generated and be able to

   reference each item.

            Your Honor, if we do that, we would like to do that

   with defense.  We would also ask that we complete our

   reciprocal discovery obligations or the defense complete their

   reciprocal discovery obligations by turning over to us all of

   their witness statements including tapes and transcripts.

            Mr. Jones has advised us that he would not turn over

   those tapes and transcripts to us because we have not turned

   over the grand jury statements in this case; but we're willing

   to do that if we could have full disclosure by the defense of

   all of their witness statements and tape-recordings and

   transcripts.

            THE COURT:  Well, sometimes it's not possible to do



                                                                           35



   these things simultaneously because there is in the trial

   process a sort of punch/counterpunch, so that, you know, you

   can't hold in any trial, civil or criminal, the defense part of

   the case to having an exclusive list until they know what the

   prosecution's list is.

            So there has to be, I think, a two-step involvement;

   and we will be addressing that before we leave in the next

   several days.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Just so the Court --

            THE COURT:  But I think we'll be doing that in

   chambers.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, sir.

            Just so the Court is aware, we have received, as I

   said, those limited statements.

            We have not severed any tangible items or documents,

   and I don't know if the defense has any to share with us; but

   obviously we would request those when it's appropriate.

            Your Honor, I think it would be best for us to move on

   to the specific --

            THE COURT:  Well, I have just this one additional

   matter, and that is mentioned by Mr. Jones; that it would be

   appreciated when you see an error or omission or some change in

   the previous list that it be specifically noted and

   communicated.

            MS. WILKINSON:  We can do that, your Honor.  Again, I



                                                                           36



   guess that's what brings me back to the "no good deed goes

   unpunished."  We were trying to complete these descriptions

   when we realized they were incomplete.  And when we send an

   updated copy -- I believe we say in our letter that this is an

   updated copy, but we will try and highlight specifically the

   descriptions that have been changed to aid the defense.

            THE COURT:  Well, the goodness of a deed is

   qualitative judgment made depending upon one's perspective, I

   suppose.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, just for the record, I

   would like to make clear what the Government has done in terms

   of disclosing information, because I think that will affect

   your rulings on the Rule 16 materials.

            As I said, as of today, we've turned over 25,000

   witness statements.  We have disclosed all the laboratory

   reports that have been generated to date.  That is 477

   laboratory reports.  We have provided all the telephone records

   and set up a private viewing room for the defense to continue

   viewing all of the telephone records.  We have turned over or

   provided an inventory for 8,335 1As, which is 99 percent of the

   1As.

            We've turned over or had the defense view and made

   copies of 3893 1B items, which is 99 percent of what the

   Government has to date.  They have seen 695 1Cs, which is all

   of the 1Cs we have to date.  They've received 440 videos or



                                                                           37



   approximately 95 percent of those; and over 30,000 photographs

   in this case, your Honor, have been provided or made available

   to the defense.

            We've turned over all the defendants' statements.

   We've turned over the summaries, the indices, the CD-ROM disks

   and other information to assist the defense in their

   preparation for this case.

            So with that in mind, your Honor, I suggest we turn to

   the specific disputes as to Rule 16.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Well, we're going to do that;

   and I'm going to be addressing these issues not in terms of

   good lawyer/bad lawyer.  I'm -- we're going to be addressing

   them in terms of the application of the provisions of the Rule

   to the items and whether they are discoverable or no.

            Mr. Jones, we may take a break before we start on the

   individual items.

            MR. JONES:  Before we do that --

            THE COURT:  Go ahead.

            MR. JONES:  I was going to say, may I take two minutes

   to respond to what she said?

            THE COURT:  You may.

            MR. JONES:  I invite the Government to give the Court

   a copy of this lab, quote, "report," close quote, on this item,

   because I believe we're talking about -- because I believe --

            MR. WYATT:  Expert summary.



                                                                           38



            MR. JONES:  It's on the expert summary.  I believe if

   the Court will review it, you won't tell from the expert

   summary what it is and what we're talking about.  It references

   that item, but it doesn't say what that item relates to where

   it goes.

            Now, I sort of suspicioned when I saw it that that's

   what it was.  But it's not clear from reading it.  So to say,

   Well, we knew about it because we got an expert summary, if

   it's not described accurately, I don't know about it at all.

            In this item right here, this docket number that I

   gave the Court earlier, there is an example.  Every so often in

   a description something gives us a clue.  And Exhibit G is a

   list of 1B items.  And in the very middle of the page, 1B,

   1225, says "scout handbook for" subject.  And that gave me the

   hint that probably all of this items -- all of these items came

   from this individual.  But the source is identified as FBI

   Agent Charlie Brown.

            So occasionally, there will be a hint, but I don't see

   how the Government can represent to the Court that, Well, gosh,

   we don't know where it came from other than Charlie Brown.  How

   are they going to put it on the stand and introduce it as an

   exhibit if they don't know what the original source of it is?

            Now, they say, well, there is a 302, and there is a

   302 from Charlie Brown that says that he got Items 921 through

   1225 from subject -- and I don't want to say John Doe, so let's



                                                                           39



   say Sam Doe.

            Well, that's true.  But that assumes that we've got

   Charlie Brown's 302.  If Charlie Brown's one of the delayed

   302's, we have no way to match it up.

            Now, if we can work out some system where there is a

   cross-reference between the 302 and the 1B list and we have the

   302, fine; but it's strains credulity to believe that the

   Government or FBI doesn't have a master list of where they got

   these items from in the field.

            With respect to the reciprocal discovery, we didn't

   have an agreement that they would get transcripts.  In fact, we

   barely had an agreement.  What we had was a unilateral

   statement by Mr. Hartzler what he was going to do.  And it

   wasn't even a written agreement.  And then problems arise.

            But this is a place where I disagree with my brother,

   Ron Woods.  Mr. Hartzler made it very clear to us that we

   weren't getting grand jury transcripts, not even exculpatory

   ones, until later.

            Well, a grand jury transcript is a transcript.  And

   that's fine with me; but you're not going to get my

   transcripts, either.  You'll get my equivalent of the 302 if we

   go out and interview Trooper Hanger, which, of course, we

   couldn't, along with a number of other witnesses; but if we

   could, we'd do an investigative report on him.  I'll give you

   the investigative report, just as you give me your 302.  When



                                                                           40



   you give me the transcript of what he told the grand jury, I'll

   give you the transcript of the interview.  That's reciprocity.

            I learned later that the Government is not giving us

   any of their interviews with witnesses that may testify in the

   second stage yet.  But I've been routinely giving them my

   witness statements for people in the second stage until

   Mr. Mackey told me that I wasn't getting his.  I didn't

   understand we weren't getting his.

            So this reciprocal discovery agreement, as Oliver

   Wendell Holmes said, "a good catch word can escape analysis for

   50 years"; and that's certainly one of them.

            But I would agree with Ms. Wilkinson:  If the Court

   sets a time and if Mr. Hartzler -- and this is the first time

   I've heard it this morning -- if they're willing to give us the

   grand jury transcripts and they get in return our transcripts,

   great.  I accept that.  All we need to do is set the date, and

   we can exchange them; and that will eliminate that problem.

            With respect to the exhibit list, I understand the

   Court's desire in that respect, but let me be frank and tell

   the Court where the danger is for the defense.  The Government

   would very much like the Court, in my opinion -- the

   prosecution -- to buy that argument.  Here's the fallacy in it:

   They've got the evidence.  They've got the tangible objects.  I

   can't talk to Trooper Hanger, I can't talk to Lea McGown, I

   can't to Vickie Beemer, I can't talk to Eldon Elliott.  They've



                                                                           41



   got guards out there.  The Court won't let me take their

   depositions in the civil suit, so my hands are tied.

            The one place they're not tied is the Government has

   got all this evidence.  I can't make my exhibit list until I

   know what they've got, because 99 percent of my exhibits come

   from theirs.

            THE COURT:  That's why I said there is a two-step

   process involved in this, as there is in every case.

            MR. JONES:  The Court understands it, and that's all I

   wanted to say.  And if you want to take a recess, we'll take up

   Rule 16 --

            THE COURT:  And when I referred to reciprocal

   discovery, I was not addressing the question of whether there

   was some agreement.  I'm talking about the reciprocity required

   by the rule and the application of the rule.

            And this matter of agreement -- and Mr. Woods, I don't

   intend to block you out of this; but obviously since severance

   has been ordered in this case and we're talking about preparing

   Mr. McVeigh's trial, your discovery matters are, you know, not

   as imperative.  But we are going to address them, which are in

   categories, as opposed to the item-by-item issues that we're

   about to deal with.

            MR. WOODS:  I appreciate that, your Honor.

            I would want to make clear to the Court that we intend

   to be prepared the same day that Mr. McVeigh is prepared for



                                                                           42



   trial.  We want to be completely prepared as of that date,

   because we don't know what can happen at that time.  So we're

   not going to be delaying our preparation --

            THE COURT:  No, I appreciate that.

            MR. WOODS:  So we will want grand testimony when it's

   given to him.  We will want items of evidence when it's given

   to him.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.  I'm not suggesting that the case be

   put on the shelf.

            MR. WOODS:  Yes, sir.

            THE COURT:  But at the same time, there are different

   priorities here.

            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, may I just --

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MR. JONES:  I apologize to the Court.  I neglected to

   suggest to the Court perhaps a way to resolve this index.  I

   asked the Court to ask the Government or order the Government

   to make a new index.  Ms. Wilkinson opposes that.

            Let me suggest that what I think might be shorter and

   simpler.  Beth -- Ms. Wilkinson is right when she says that we

   earlier reviewed this material and had the chance to look at

   it.  And that's true.  But that review was many, many months

   ago, when we had very little discovery from the Government.

   We're going in and seeing material with our clients not there



                                                                           43



   with us.  Our experts weren't even hired.  And so the relevance

   or materiality of it in many, many cases, escaped us.

            I mean, I went for months making facetious comments

   about that they had given me everything from the sink to trash;

   and sure enough, they had, and in the trash was a gold mine.

   But I didn't know it was a gold mine there.  I didn't

   understand the significance of it.

            How about this:  Suppose we take all of these items

   that are on the 1A list that they believe we're entitled to

   see -- and let's be fair about it.  I mean I don't ask to see

   FBI field notes; but I think I am, for example, entitled to see

   Andy Strassmeir's immigration file, which is in the 1A list.

   And then let's take all the items in 1B and bring them in.  And

   if it takes a week, two weeks a month, so be it.  Allow us to

   photograph it, videotape it, but have a knowledgeable

   prosecutor or a knowledgeable FBI agent there so that if we

   pick up an item and we say, what is this item, they can tell us

   that is the blank to the blank.

            Now, surely there is somebody that's got that

   knowledge.  And then we'll make up our own index.  And I

   suspect that may be the quicker way to do it, although it will

   take a little while.  It's lawyer's time as opposed to typist's

   time; but in the long run it may be quicker.  And we'll bring

   our experts in and go through it.

            THE COURT:  Well, you can discuss that.



                                                                           44



            We'll take a 20 minute recess.

       (Recess at 10:05 a.m.)

       (Reconvened at 10:25 a.m.)

            THE COURT:  Please be seated.

            Mr. Jones, you and Mr. Nigh together or --

            MR. JONES:  Mr. Wyatt, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  Oh, all right.  Mr. Wyatt.

            MR. JONES:  If I understand the Court, we are now on

   Mr. McVeigh's narrowed Rule 16 motion.

            THE COURT:  October 23 and the Government's response

   of November 7.

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.  And I'm going to work from the

   Government's response since they were kind enough to set forth

   what we requested and then give a response.

            THE COURT:  Yes.  Yes.  That is very helpful.  I

   appreciate it.

            MR. JONES:  Now, a good deed that does not go

   punished, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  This one is rewarded with recognition.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, with respect to A, statement

   of the defendants, if we could turn to page 6.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. JONES:  The Government has made certain

   representations there in the paragraph which begins, "While the

   defendant's oral statement," and I will accept those



                                                                           45



   representations down to the last two sentences.  Or the -- yes.

   Which begins at the bottom of the page, The "prosecution does

   not intend to introduce as evidence in chief at trial any video

   or audio footage of Mr. McVeigh while he has been

   incarcerated," et cetera.

            My understanding -- and perhaps this is just a wording

   difference, but I believe there is a written agreement between

   ourselves and Mr. Ryan -- and I think maybe even Judge Russell

   signed off on it -- that none of these videotapes that are part

   of the surveillance at either El Reno or Englewood would be

   used for any purpose other than the security there.  And so

   when I see that they won't use it for evidence in chief, I

   don't know whether I'm misunderstanding what I thought our

   agreement was or whether they just simply say evidence in chief

   because that's how they describe most everything, but I do

   think I would agree as far as I know it's not relevant or

   material to the case, but I'm struck by this narrowing language

   "as evidence in chief at trial."  And I ask the Court to

   inquire of the Government whether there is any intention to use

   any of those films or audio of Mr. McVeigh for any purpose at

   trial.

            THE COURT:  Well, I suppose what the Government is

   saying is unless you open the door.  That's what I usually see.

   So -- is that right, Mr. Ryan or Ms. Wilkinson?  I --

   Ms. Wilkinson, should we be addressing you here?



                                                                           46



            MR. HARTZLER:  Please.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Sure.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, should I just speak from

   this microphone?

            THE COURT:  Yes, I think it would be more convenient.

            MS. WILKINSON:  You're correct, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  Thank you.  Also on the subject of Mike

   and Lori Fortier, while the Government says that the

   co-conspirator statements are not discoverable, it has provided

   the testimony of Michael and Lori Fortier and at least

   represents all of the 302's -- although there is still some

   dispute of the proffer of those, but from our review of the

   302's and the grand jury testimony, it appears to suggest that

   Michael and Lori Fortier are co-conspirators, although formally

   in the court, the Government denies it.  And at some point --

   and I don't know necessarily today is the time to do it, but I

   just raise it -- I think we need a ruling from the Court on

   whether they were co-conspirators to determine whether their

   testimony falls under co-conspirator hearsay.

            THE COURT:  Yes.  Well, the way I read the response --

   and I'll ask Ms. Wilkinson to confirm it -- is the Government

   intends, as it says here, pretrial proffer, identifying those

   who are going to be considered conspirators and whose

   statements would be under 801(d)(2)(e).



                                                                           47



            MS. WILKINSON:  That's right, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. JONES:  All right.

            THE COURT:  Of course, we need to set that time.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, to be --

            THE COURT:  I don't mean right at this instance, but

   we need to set that time.

            MS. WILKINSON:  To be clear, though, it's the

   Government's position that all the witnesses that are going to

   testify do not have to be co-conspirators themselves to testify

   to co-conspirator statements under 801(d) --

            THE COURT:  But we've got to know who you're saying

   are the co-conspirators, whose statements can come in and not

   be hearsay.

            MS. WILKINSON:  We will provide that, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  Section B, your Honor, on page 7.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  There the Government I believe has stated

   that they would try to get the copies of the films from the

   Noble County Sheriff's Office, the undeveloped rolls.  Is it

   appropriate to ask the Court to inquire on the status of that?

            THE COURT:  Yes.  Can you respond to that,

   Ms. Wilkinson?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, your Honor.  But first, I believe



                                                                           48



   that's under (c).

            MR. JONES:  I'm sorry.  You're correct.  It is under

   (c).  I'll come back to it.

            THE COURT:  These -- all right.  Photographs taken at

   the Noble County Jail.

            MR. JONES:  With the respect to the Government's

   response to (d), that appears to us just to be an adequate

   response, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  With respect to (c) --

            THE COURT:  Now, there is, you know, an objection by

   the co-defendant to the production of the tapes concerning him.

   And that's, as I understand it, consistent with Judge Alley's

   order.

            MR. JONES:  Yes.

            THE COURT:  Which is -- and I don't intend to modify

   that.

            MR. JONES:  I was going to say, I'm not asking for

   those now.  We have the 302's; and if there's something there

   that we think is material, we'll address the Court with due

   notice to Mr. Nichols' team.

            THE COURT:  Right.  And vice versa, they are not going

   to go either way as Judge Alley directed.

            MR. JONES:  With respect to (c), your Honor, I believe

   that brings us to the mug shots of the defendant at the Noble



                                                                           49



   County Jail and the 35-millimeter prints.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I believe we're trying to

   obtain them.  I can't tell you where we are in the process

   right now, but we are trying to obtain them.  We have already

   provided copies of those photographs.  I believe Mr. Jones is

   just asking for the actual --

            THE COURT:  When you say "locate," you're talking

   about the negatives being located?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I was just handed a note

   that they are actually here in Denver and we're printing the

   negatives.  We do have them, and we'll turn them over to the

   defense as soon as they are printed.

            MR. JONES:  They are at MotoPhoto, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, on page (d) -- I'm sorry, page

   8(d), the principal problem that we have here is that the

   Government does not admit, nor deny, whether these items have

   been produced completely and they do not identify where they

   are produced with a 1B number.

            THE COURT:  I'm -- I'm not tracking with you here.

            MR. JONES:  Well,

            THE COURT:  Item -- you're talking about (d) at page

   8?

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.

            THE COURT:  Item 1A?  Is that --



                                                                           50



            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir, which starts with 1A, I believe,

   or books and papers, and (a) as signed by the defendant, (b) as

   obtained from the defendant.  (c) -- in other words, 1(a)

   through 1(w) with, of course, the exception of the ones

   withdrawn, which I believe were (d), (j), (k), (l), (m), (o),

   (q), (t), and (u).  And our concern there is that the

   Government does not admit or deny whether those were

   produced -- were produced and they do not identify where they

   are produced with a 1B number.

            THE COURT:  Well, we're addressing three categories of

   documents and objects here.  Right?

            MR. JONES:  No, sir.  At this time, I'm only

   addressing 1(a) through (w).

            THE COURT:  Oh.  All right.  Books, papers and the

   like.  The response is more -- yeah.  Okay.  I'm with you.  But

   there are three -- there are three types of such documents

   under the rule as the Government responds.  But as I understand

   your response, Ms. Wilkinson, this is -- you produced

   everything you had?

            MS. WILKINSON:  That's correct, your Honor, under all

   three of these categories.

            THE COURT:  Under all three categories.

            MR. JONES:  Excuse me.

            THE COURT:  Now, your question was --

            MR. JONES:  That was one of them.  The second question



                                                                           51



   was --

            THE COURT:  How they are identified by a 1B number.

            MR. JONES:  Well, are they in the 1B so we can find

   them?  I mean to produce them, hundreds of thousands of sheets

   of paper, I think under -- our point was that under the Ollison

   case, that they are required to tell us where these items are,

   to give us the 1B numbers.

            THE COURT:  Well, are they all in 1B?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Most are in 1B, your Honor.  Some are

   1A, but they are identified.  Or they are 302's.  It depends on

   how you read this.  I don't know if you go to (r), any and all

   documents or other tangible objects obtained from Elliott's

   Body Shop in or around Junction City, Kansas, those are items

   on the 1B list.  The defense has reviewed them.  We provided

   copies.  I guess he's asking us to list for him -- to go review

   all the 1B and say which one relates to those topics, and we

   would object to that.

            MR. JONES:  I think that's what we are asking because

   of the confusion on the 1B and in reliance on the Ollison case

   which we cited, we are -- as we read Ollison, they can't just

   dump it on us and say, Over here in these 2500 boxes.  They

   should identify by 1B number where these items are.  That's

   what we're asking for.

            THE COURT:  In each category or what?

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.



                                                                           52



            THE COURT:  Well, your request is denied.  You know,

   you've got adequate resources to do that yourself.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, item -- items on page 12

   beginning with 2, they are labeled at the top, Telephone

   Records of Defendant, Modified Request.  Here is what we

   propose to the Government as a way to resolve this dispute and

   to save their time and sort of shift the burden over to us.

   What we ask was that the Government's phone record database,

   which is a kind of a computerized brain of the phone numbers of

   many different individuals, be furnished to us so that if we

   had their database, then we would simply put it into our

   computer equipment and it would print off all the phone records

   that we need.

            The Government's first response to that -- and we

   dealt with Mr. Mackey in that respect -- was that we could

   prepare our own database from the computer disks of the phone

   summaries they provided for us.  We've already done that, but

   the problem is that our database is limited to the following

   individuals:  Tim McVeigh, Terry Nichols, Michael Fortier,

   James Nichols, Kevin Nichols, Bill McVeigh, and various motels.

   Now, in addition to those individuals, there are dozens of

   other people and institutions or businesses whose phone records

   the Government has, and they have a database for them.

            For example, from the material that we have received,

   it appears that the Government has, for example, the phone



                                                                           53



   records of David Millar's phone number which are not produced

   for us.  But from the material that we saw, we could identify

   that they had those records.  So on their database, they

   entered David Millar's phone records, but we don't have David

   Millar's phone records so we can't enter it.

            The second reason that was given to us was that, well,

   there could be a lot of inaccuracies and we would have the same

   problem that we had with the original records on the -- what I

   call the spotlight credit card, also known as the Darrell

   Bridges debit card and the Government did not want to be caught

   in what we call an Oklahoma Wewoka switch, where they gave us

   something and then we came back and said it was inaccurate.

   Well, we view that as an issue.

            We're prepared to accept any inaccuracies in that

   database for the purpose of doing our own analysis of the phone

   records.  And if they are inaccurate, they are inaccurate to

   both sides and what this is is really more an investigation

   item than it is the preparation of a specific exhibit.

            We need the database to study the patterns and themes

   and geographical locations of the calls being made.  For

   example, there is a suggestion in some of the materials we

   received that there is a strong pattern of calls between an

   individual that lives in the state of Arkansas and an

   individual who lives in the state of Oklahoma.  So what if

   there are one or two mistakes in that database?  It's not going



                                                                           54



   to prevent us from discovering the pattern.

            Then we were told that the Government would create

   phone summaries for anyone that we gave them the name for and

   that we could add those to the database.  That would be great

   if it worked that way, but it doesn't work that way.  We still

   do not have as of this morning accurate phone summaries of all

   people, Tim McVeigh and Terry Nichols, nor do we have the

   actual phone records for Tim and Terry, not to mention everyone

   else's, to prepare our own summary, even though we have been

   asking for them for 11 months.  When we brought this up to the

   Government, their response was, well, okay, tell us the 1A and

   1B numbers and we will copy them and produce them to you.

            Well, we did that just as they asked us to do.  We

   wrote -- actually, Ms. McLaughlin wrote a two- or three-page

   letter specifically listing each phone record by 1A or B number

   in response to their suggestion of how to proceed.  The

   Government's response was -- and it's recorded in their

   correspondence -- that we requested too many phone numbers and

   90 percent of what you requested is irrelevant.  Well, 75 to

   80 percent of what we requested were the phone records of

   Mr. McVeigh, Mr. Nichols, Mr. Fortier and other principal

   persons identified in this case.  25 percent of the requested

   items were phone records which the Government did not identify

   on their index.

            So after we wrote that letter, they said they would



                                                                           55



   review all the phone records or have them available for us to

   review on November 11.  Well, on November 11, we appeared and

   only the 1B numbers were produced that day.  We still haven't

   seen those that are in the 1A category, which is about a third

   of the total.

            On November 12, Ms. McLaughlin returned and waited an

   hour and a half for the Government to open the doors of the

   room where the records were located, and records were

   eventually opened.  But we still don't have all of those phone

   records, and I think it's fair to say that in this case, phone

   records are incredibly important to the Government and they are

   certainly -- if somewhat less important to the defendant, they

   are still crucial in preparing our answer to the Government's

   arguments and to analyzing the phone records of individuals

   that we think are relevant to this case.

            All of that is my way of bringing it down to saying

   that in -- that we simply ask them if you'll give us your

   database, we'll put it in our computer and we won't have to

   mess with all of this paper because you've got the database.

   Otherwise, you have to give us all the raw records and then we

   have to construct our own database from them.

            THE COURT:  Well, let me -- as I understand this

   response, there are -- well, two categories, obviously.

   There's the Darrell Bridges card, and we addressed that at an

   earlier hearing on a different motion.  And there were problems



                                                                           56



   with respect to the FBI summary there and that was going to be

   looked at.

            Now, this answer says that the Government has

   obtained -- it says to me the business records directly from

   the phone company in a computerized database of some sort.  And

   then there are all of these other records, so the first thing

   was I thought that an effort was going to be made to straighten

   out the FBI summary.

            MS. WILKINSON:  That was made, your Honor.  Perhaps

   Mr. Mackey should address this since he's been handling all the

   phone records.

            MR. JONES:  If I may, perhaps Ms. McLaughlin could

   respond for us.  I think she and Mr. Mackey are really the

   people who have been working on this.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. MACKEY:  Thank you, your Honor.  In keeping with

   the theme set this morning; that is, looking ahead to getting

   this case ready for trial, one big picture point needs to be

   made.  I would expect and I've advised each of counsel for

   Mr. McVeigh, Mr. Nichols that at the time of the trial, the

   Government will offer and rely in substantial part upon records

   generated by the Darrell Bridges debit card.

            In very secondary part, in fact in a part so small I

   could put it in my briefcase, we'll rely upon more traditional

   non-debit card phone records.  And that's how this case is



                                                                           57



   going to shape up when it becomes -- when it comes to trial in

   terms of the telephone evidence.  So the focus, your Honor, I

   think has to be on the Bridges records.

            There has been no challenge to the accuracy of the FBI

   summary of the Darrell Bridges account.

            THE COURT:  Well, there was certainly confusion here

   in this courtroom when it was discussed and testified about.

            MR. MACKEY:  Because, Judge, the confusion was about

   non-Bridges telephone records.  The only records --

            THE COURT:  I don't know.  I remember an exhibit and

   that it was -- there were deficiencies in the exhibit brought

   to our attention at the time of the cross-examination.

            MR. MACKEY:  Judge, the actual -- the history begins

   before the Court was designated in this case when we had a

   meeting, we talked with defense counsel about what about these

   voluminous records, how can we expedite the production.  The

   question at the time was made well, if you generate summaries

   of telephone records, give us those summaries.  We know under

   the law, the Government is not required to produce those or to

   make them or to produce them if they are not going to be

   Government exhibits.  We did that with respect to a number of

   designated individuals and produced those in January of 1996.

   Those are persons other than Darrell Bridges.  Those were the

   only records that were challenged during the suppression

   hearing in June, six months later, about their accuracy.



                                                                           58



   Nothing was challenged about the Darrell Bridges.

            Now, since then, again, Judge, just to give a status

   report, if you will, I have met as recently as August of this

   year with representatives of both teams and with the FBI person

   responsible for producing the Darrell Bridges summary.  And in

   a lengthy meeting, after the time that we had produced all of

   the raw data, we discussed firsthand through the witness

   exactly what methods the FBI used to produce that summary of

   the Darrell Bridges account.  I can represent to the Court I've

   been told by the Nichols team, for example, that on certain

   conditions, they expect they will be able to stipulate.  We've

   not advanced that far with the McVeigh team, but we're

   continuing those discussions.

            So once again, those two categories brings us back to

   the point of discussion; there's been no challenge to the

   accuracy of the Darrell Bridges summary.

            MR. WOODS:  May I just clear up one issue and I think

   the Court is aware of it.  Mr. Mackey may be overlooking that

   dispute on the Darrell Bridges phone records that did not

   distinguish between a connected call and ringing call.

            THE COURT:  Yes.  This went to who was in the house --

            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor.  We've --

            THE COURT:  -- in Herington, Kansas?

            MR. WOODS:  We've been working on that.

            MR. MACKEY:  Yes, your Honor.  That was not a Darrell



                                                                           59



   Bridges record.  That was a record of activity at the Terry

   Nichols residence.

            MR. WOODS:  But the Darrell Bridges records also have

   that dispute in them and the Court is correct that was the

   difference in the dispute over the Bridges card.

            MR. MACKEY:  That's the state of the record.  Let me

   fast forward to where we are right now, Judge.  I have worked

   with Ms. McLaughlin and we have decided the best method to get

   full disclosure to the defense is make all of those records

   available to the defense.  And so a room has been set aside in

   this building -- or in the Federal Building for a review of all

   the telephone records so that they can make an isolated,

   focused, defense-oriented review of any phone record they want

   to look at.

            THE COURT:  When you say "the records," what are you

   talking about?

            MR. MACKEY:  It's just like a phone record you would

   get for your phone bill.  It's whatever record we got from the

   phone company.  If we got that in hard copy, that's what we

   have in the exhibit room.  If we got that by way of

   computerized disk, that's what we have in the exhibit room.

            THE COURT:  Now, has the Government created its own

   database from those records for purposes of the summaries?

            MR. MACKEY:  We have -- yes, we have downloaded much

   of that information; not all of that for -- for our work



                                                                           60



   product analysis and can generate -- as we have produced to the

   defense before -- individual summaries of individual persons.

   We have committed in a letter as recently as last week that we

   will produce summaries that, again, we're not likely to

   offer -- in fact, almost surely will not offer in our case in

   chief for eight individuals and our categories of persons that

   the defense has requested.

            THE COURT:  So, you know, you've obtained, as I take

   it, from the carrier companies the service companies, the -- a

   great mass of telephone records or a lot of different numbers,

   a lot of different people.  And that's all available?

            MR. MACKEY:  Right.

            THE COURT:  Now, the format in which it is available

   is, in part, on a computer and, in part, printouts?

            MR. MACKEY:  Well, yeah.  The printout would simply be

   a report requested from that computer database.  It's the pool

   of information that's been downloaded and we say Mr. Computer,

   tell us what you know about the Terry Nichols home phone number

   and it'll generate a printout that's peculiar to that

   particular person or time period.  And those are the kinds of

   guiding principles, if you will, that we've tried to use in our

   discussions.  What's important to the defense, give us those

   persons and we'll generate those specific summaries and

   Ms. McLaughlin and I have agreed there's those eight

   individuals that are top priority and those are the ones that



                                                                           61



   we are producing.  And borrowing upon the experience in June,

   Judge, I was -- the FBI are making the careful evaluations to

   ensure that those summaries, once produced, are accurate.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Well, Ms. McLaughlin, are you

   going to respond to this?

            MS. McLAUGHLIN:  Yes, your Honor.  First of all, let

   me respond in the order that Mr. Mackey addressed the items.

   We haven't made any challenges to the Bridges phone records as

   of this point and the simple reason is because we -- the

   background records that they used to create the Bridges summary

   are massive.  We've had an expert working on the background

   documents for a couple of months just to produce our own

   Bridges summary so we can then compare it to the Government's

   to verify the accuracy of their summary.  And Mr. Mackey will

   agree I believe the Government has spent thousands of hours

   just on the Bridges summary, preparing it.

            Also, in reference to the room set aside to review

   records --

            THE COURT:  What are you saying?  You don't know

   whether you're going to challenge it or not?

            MS. McLAUGHLIN:  That's correct, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  When are we going to know this?  What does

   it take?  I'm -- you know, this material, I would assume, is

   going to be submitted under Rule 1006 and we want to get in a

   position to do that.



                                                                           62



            MS. McLAUGHLIN:  I understand that, your Honor.

   And --

            THE COURT:  Well, what do you need that you don't

   have?

            MS. McLAUGHLIN:  We're working on preparing our own

   Bridges summary at this point.

            THE COURT:  What do you need that you don't have

   available?

            MS. McLAUGHLIN:  Time.  That's all.  In reference to

   the Bridges summary.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MS. McLAUGHLIN:  And then in reference to the other

   summaries and the database, we need the databases Mr. Jones

   stated to illustrate to the defense the different themes and

   patterns.

            THE COURT:  What database are you talking about?

            MS. McLAUGHLIN:  The one prepared by the Government

   where they received all the raw phone records, the physical

   records from all the different phone companies and then they

   took those phone records and they look just like the phone

   records you receive each month and they took these and typed in

   the phone numbers, the times they were called, the dates and

   the duration, and they input those records into a database.  We

   can do the same thing after we make copies of the records

   while -- when the records are in this common area, common room,



                                                                           63



   we can make copies of them and then we can send them to an

   expert or a clerk to data entry all the phone records.  That's

   going to take many, many hours and it's -- I don't think we

   should waste our time and resources when they have it in a

   database.

            They responded that it's their work product, but I

   suggest that the simple data entry of the phone numbers and

   times and numerals isn't work product.  It's how they use the

   database, how they obtain records and reports from the

   database.  As Mr. Mackey stated, you have this database and

   then you tell it to -- you tell the computer to pull up

   everything it knows about one particular phone call, it gathers

   records from five or six different phone companies and produces

   one report.  That's work product.  The database isn't.  And

   that's what we want is the database so that we can prepare our

   own reports.

            THE COURT:  Well, I didn't understand that the

   Government had loaded everything into a database.  Maybe I'm

   misinformed.  Mr. Mackey, straighten this out for me.  I'm

   becoming a little irritated.

            MR. MACKEY:  I understand.  Judge, not every telephone

   record received by the FBI has been downloaded into the

   computer database.  It is partial.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Now, what's your objection to

   their using that database?  None?  Done.



                                                                           64



            MS. McLAUGHLIN:  Thank you, your Honor.

            MR. MACKEY:  I'm trying to formulate the objection,

   Judge, and part of it has to do with the experience in June

   and, again, Mr. Jones addressed that.  We produced a summary

   and then there were challenges made to it as to a wide range of

   evidence.  I mean, if we get the caveat, your Honor, that they

   are not going to point to an inversion of numbers or an absence

   of a particular entry in that database as a reason why,

   suddenly, the rest of the Government's evidence is

   inadmissible, then we're prepared to turn it over.

            THE COURT:  How can you extort some kind of a promise

   like that?  There's either -- if there are defects in there, we

   ought to know about them.

            MR. MACKEY:  But they are not the records, Judge.

   That's the whole point.

            THE COURT:  You provide the database.  That's an

   order.

            MR. MACKEY:  Yes, sir.

            MS. McLAUGHLIN:  Thank you, your Honor.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, I was looking at paragraph 3

   and I believe that the Government's response --

            THE COURT:  Page 14?

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  That's been resolved by the Government's



                                                                           65



   response.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. JONES:  4(a), (b), (c), has been withdrawn by the

   defendant.

            5(a) -- well, 5(b), (c), and (d) has been resolved

   because the Government says they will provide it.  And I'll

   repeat again that's 5(b), (c), and (d).  And let me just look

   at (a) for a moment.  I think that's been resolved, also.  Yes.

   That's been resolved.  The Government challenges our standing

   to get the mail cover and much as it pains me, they may be

   right.  We'll withdraw it.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  That brings us to item (e), which we

   requested reports, communications between the Government and

   certain Federal Express, UPS, DHL and/or the United States

   Postal Service.  The Government objects to that.  If I can find

   their objection here.  It's the bottom of page 15 and 16.  I'll

   withdraw that.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  (f) has already been previously been

   withdrawn.  Now, I'm on item 16 on page -- I'm sorry -- item 6

   on page 16 of the Government's response.

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MR. JONES:  The Government says that they are not

   aware of any documents responsive to this request and in their



                                                                           66



   possession that have not already been made available.  I'll

   accept their response, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  That brings me to number 7 at the bottom

   of 16.  Your Honor, one of the things we asked for here, there

   was a report in the press -- and I don't want to get into

   privileged information, but let me just say that part of this

   request is based upon information given to us by the client,

   that Mr. McVeigh during the questioning in the Noble County

   Jail by the FBI was shown some photographs and we asked to see

   the photographs that were shown to him.

            The last two days -- or about two days ago, Mr. Mackey

   and Mr. Connelly advised us that they had interviewed the

   agents and I suppose that's kind of a supplement to their

   response here -- and while the agents didn't deny that

   photographs were shown, as I understand it, it's impossible to

   tell which photographs were shown if, in fact, any.  That being

   the case, I think we'll just have to rest on the Government's

   response.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor --

            THE COURT:  Yes.  Ms. Wilkinson.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I don't believe that is correct.  I

   believe the agents said they did not recall showing any

   photographs to Mr. McVeigh.

            MR. JONES:  All right.  I didn't mean to misstate it.



                                                                           67



   The point I was making, they did follow through on it.

            THE COURT:  Have you provided the best description of

   the photographs that's available to you?

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  So I'll accept their response.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  That brings me to item 8, which is

   searches and seizures.  That's been resolved by the

   Government's response.

            That brings me to item 9 on page 18.  Item (a), the

   Government says that none other than what has been produced.

   (b) and (c) were withdrawn.

            Item (d) is important to us, your Honor.  We have seen

   this item -- it's crucial to the defense case and I think

   crucial to the Government case.  I won't identify it further

   except to say that it's a video image of the defendant at a

   particular location at a particular time, but I'll hasten to

   say because there's been so much speculation about it that it's

   not a video image of anything in Oklahoma, but in another

   location and I won't identify it further unless the Court

   wishes me to.

            What we simply seek here is access to the original

   videotape and the type of equipment that was used to record the

   tape.



                                                                           68



            Now, the type of equipment is private property in the

   installation -- which is a restaurant -- where it was recorded.

   The image of it is -- is not the best quality, but fairly good.

   There's another part of it where the image is a little blurred.

   The Court authorized, pursuant to an 848, that we retain a

   certain expert to assist us in those matters and we sent that

   expert copies.  The expert says that the copies are -- he can't

   tell how many generations they are.  That he needs physically

   to inspect the original and the equipment.  I don't know

   whether the Government has the equipment.  It may be at the

   private location.  If it is, it's beyond the Government's

   control and we'll just have to work it out with them.  And I'm

   sure that can be worked out, but we would like to examine --

   have our expert come to wherever it is and examine the original

   and put it on some equipment that he has so that he can answer

   our questions about it.  And Mr. Wyatt would like to supplement

   that.

            MR. WYATT:  Your Honor, if it please, the reason that

   we need the original tapes is because -- and the identification

   of the type of equipment is that the type of equipment he'll

   have to use and provide for his own review will be dependent

   upon the type of equipment used at the scene where the

   videotape was done because there are different types of

   commercial grade equipment.  These generally take still

   photographs as opposed to a true videotape.  There will be a



                                                                           69



   series of still photographs and one tape may last 120 hours.

   The review of it then has to be done in a slow motion -- or not

   even slow motion but freeze frame, one-by-one review, simply

   because you cannot watch it in sequence.  It goes too fast even

   with the slow motion.

            Additionally, the -- the Government -- excuse me --

   the defense would accept, I believe, your Honor, digitized

   copies and I'm sure that the Government's experts know what

   those are, but that is a type of copy that is a virtual -- it's

   almost identical and is not a generation made from a video

   cassette recorder and we would advise the Court we would accept

   a digitized copy if they have those, as well.

            MR. JONES:  I don't want to mislead the Court, though,

   or let the Court think that's the only issue.  As Ms. Wilkinson

   said earlier and I think I said, there's been 450 to 500 hours

   of videotapes that have been provided.  Most of these

   videotapes, your Honor, are either from locations in Kansas or

   the Junction City and perhaps Herington area and the Oklahoma

   City area and then videotapes at various installations such as

   an ATM or turnpike or the service station along Interstate 35

   and perhaps other locations.  That's been a major problem for

   us because as we previously advised the Court, you can't even

   watch it in real time.  I mean, if you were to watch it in real

   time, it would be 500 hours of some attorney's time and then

   somewhere, there has to be some priority or decision made on



                                                                           70



   what you will do and what you won't do.

            On the other hand, because the Government and the

   defense see the facts in this case so diametrically different,

   we felt that it was our duty to review them.  But the problem

   is that some of them are very blurred, the copies we have.  The

   lighting is bad and unless you see the original, in many cases,

   you can't really tell what's there.  That's not the

   Government's fault.  I mean, I can understand why they are not

   giving us the original and retain the copies.  So we then said

   well, the Government has got 302's because they had somebody

   sit down and review all these tapes, so let's read their 302's

   and see if they found anything relevant and perhaps if they

   didn't, we'll put it aside.  Of course, what they think may be

   relevant and what we think may be relevant from the defense

   standpoint are two different things.  I mean, clearly, if they

   say something is relevant from the prosecution standpoint, we

   want to look at it, but that which is mitigation or

   exculpatory, they may not even see as relevant, vice versa.

            So what we did was we prioritized the tapes we wanted

   to see.  And we can give that list to them and some of them are

   identified here.  Let our expert come here and view the

   original of the tape and if he needs to look at it on his

   equipment, then let the FBI bring it to him and in New York,

   and stay there with it so that they maintain the custody on it.

   Whatever is necessary to maintain the custody and integrity of



                                                                           71



   it, we don't have a problem with.  But it's not either one of

   our fault.  Just poor copies.

            THE COURT:  Well, how many are you talking about?  I'm

   confused.  I thought you were talking about a particular one.

            MR. JONES:  Well, that's the most important.

            THE COURT:  Let's deal with that first.

            MR. JONES:  All right.  That's the most important one.

            THE COURT:  Now, Ms. Wilkinson, do you know what he's

   talking about?

            MS. WILKINSON:  I believe I do, your Honor.  I believe

   it's a videotape from a McDonald's of Mr. McVeigh.

            THE COURT:  And do you have that?

            MS. WILKINSON:  We have the videotape.  We provided

   that to the defense long ago.

            THE COURT:  In a copy.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Because I understand we're trying to

   go through what the Government has produced.  I'm unaware the

   defense has made the request to us to have the expert review --

            THE COURT:  In whatever is the most original form.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Right.  I will try and make

   arrangements for that.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MS. WILKINSON:  However, I do not have the equipment

   McDonald's used to record it.  And Mr. Jones is free to go to

   McDonald's and check out the equipment.  This is not a request,



                                                                           72



   your Honor, that we ever received before.

            THE COURT:  Well, let's don't worry about that.

   You're going to accommodate this request now?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Of course.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. JONES:  Could we -- that's fine and we'll

   approach --

            THE COURT:  And then if you identify others, I'm sure

   you'll get the same accommodation.

            MR. JONES:  We have a list of about 20.  If we could

   just do those and if we need to do those, we'll worry about

   those when we complete the 20.

            THE COURT:  All right.  And then of course, any use of

   it beyond that in terms of using it on other equipment and so

   forth would have to be monitored and agreed to so that we don't

   have a problem with respect to its element of admissibility if,

   for some reason, it becomes an exhibit.

            MR. JONES:  On item (e), your Honor, the Court has

   told us that the garage tape of the Alfred Murrah Building did

   not work that morning and, therefore, there's no visual images

   on it and we've made the inquiry and perhaps we could -- were

   there any other cameras in the building that recorded anything

   that morning or previous days?

            THE COURT:  Other than the garage?  Is that --

            MR. JONES:  Yes.



                                                                           73



            THE COURT:  -- what you're saying?

            MR. JONES:  Or if the garage camera worked on a

   previous day.  The materiality, in the 302's that have been

   provided to us, there are a number of people who claim to have

   seen Mr. McVeigh or people that resembled Mr. McVeigh in this

   building at various times.  And we dispute that.  And we want

   to see the tapes, so if there's a tape that picks it up, we can

   look at it and prove that it's not him.

            THE COURT:  Well, I understood your response to be

   that there aren't any, but is that right?

            MR. JONES:  Is -- I'm sorry.

            MS. WILKINSON:  That's my understanding, your Honor.

   We turned over all videotapes.  There's no videotapes of

   Mr. McVeigh on April 19, 1995.

            THE COURT:  Well, are there --

            MS. WILKINSON:  In the garage or in the area of the

   Murrah Building.

            THE COURT:  Apart from whether it's of Mr. McVeigh,

   are there videotapes of the day?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, your Honor.  We've disclosed to

   Mr. Jones a videotape of the Ryder truck that fits the

   description of the Ryder truck rented at Elliott's.  That's

   from the Regency Towers, which is down the block.

            THE COURT:  I think his request was within the Murrah

   Building.  Is that what your request was?



                                                                           74



            MR. JONES:  Yes.  Because there's a half a dozen law

   enforcement agencies --

            THE COURT:  I understand that.  I don't need all that.

   All I want the Government to respond to is whether you have any

   videotapes from any cameras within the Murrah Building on April

   19.

            MR. JONES:  There's another way to clear this up.  If

   the Government is not going to offer any testimony at the trial

   that Mr. McVeigh was in the Murrah Building on any occasion

   before April 19, then I don't need them.  But if witnesses are

   going to get on the stand and say well, I saw Mr. Mc --

            THE COURT:  That's a different thing.  I'm not going

   to ask them to stipulate factually to those things.  The

   question is are there such types --

            MS. WILKINSON:  I don't believe there are, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  You'll double check.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I will double check.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MS. WILKINSON:  And we have turned over all the

   videotapes we have so I just need to go back.  All the

   videotapes we've checked.

            THE COURT:  Yes.  But I -- okay.  But I think this

   specific request is were there operating cameras within the

   Murrah Building on the day in question for which you have

   videotapes.  Anywhere in the building.  All right.



                                                                           75



            MR. JONES:  Actually, your Honor, I think we requested

   prior to the day in question.  There are reports from

   witnesses --

            THE COURT:  Well, what days?

            MR. JONES:  It's page -- top of page 19.

            THE COURT:  What days.

            MR. JONES:  August 1, '94, through April 23, '95.

            THE COURT:  Well, that's a lot of material.

            MR. JONES:  I don't know that there are any

   videotapes, but they gave -- we got those dates from 302's they

   gave us of people that claim to have seen him in the building.

   And it's also the dates of the conspiracy alleged in the

   indictment.

            THE COURT:  Well, the question is you're asking for

   any videotapes within the Murrah Building in any cameras there

   for that period of time?

            MR. JONES:  From -- if there are any tapes, and there

   may not be any.  August 1, '94, to April 23, '95.

            THE COURT:  So you'll find out where cameras were and

   whether there are such tapes.

            MS. WILKINSON:  If there are records to that effect,

   we will try and track them down and see what we can learn.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  All right, your Honor.  (f) has been

   resolved as indicated there.  (g) is a key issue.  And again,



                                                                           76



   this is a -- an issue with respect to saving time.  The

   Government has furnished to us tapes of court-ordered

   electronic surveillance and wire taps and bugs.  We --

            THE COURT:  I'm sorry.  What number are you on?

            MR. JONES:  I'm sorry.  It's page 19, number -- number

   what -- 8(g).  I'll read it.

            THE COURT:  I have it.

            MR. JONES:  You have it?

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MR. JONES:  Thank you.  We would like -- the

   Government surely has transcripts of the conversations of

   the -- is this something filed under seal?  No.  Of Michael and

   Lori Fortier, Jennifer McVeigh, William McVeigh and Mickey

   Frasier.  And we ask for the Government to furnish us their

   transcripts simply to save the expense of our having

   transcripts prepared.

            THE COURT:  Well, your response?  I'm not clear what

   your response.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I believe we informed the

   defense counsel months ago we had draft transcripts of Michael

   Fortier's electronic surveillance and we would provide those to

   them upon receipt of written confirmation that they would not

   use those draft transcripts as cross-examination material at

   trial, which I think is regular procedure when you provide

   draft transcripts, and we have not received that representation



                                                                           77



   from Mr. Jones.

            MR. JONES:  Well, I apologize that they haven't.  I'd

   be glad to give it right now.  If we cross-examine on them on

   anything, we'll have our own transcripts, but I was looking for

   something that would screen out the irrelevant so we could

   focus on the relevant.

            THE COURT:  All right.  You'll provide them then?

   Right, Ms. Wilkinson?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.

            THE COURT:  Mr. Nichols, the same as --

            MR. WOODS:  You received it over a month ago.  Is that

   the reason we didn't get it, because Jones didn't comply?

            THE COURT:  You're going to give it to both -- counsel

   for both defendants?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Right.  As long as -- yes.  As

   Mr. Woods says, they have certified, so that's not a problem.

            MR. JONES:  May I inquire of the Court, or counsel

   through the Court for the Government, are the only transcripts

   draft transcripts or whatever form they are in that you have

   are just of Mr. Fortier?

            MS. WILKINSON:  I'm not sure if we have draft

   transcripts of the others.  I believe we do of Jennifer

   McVeigh.

            MR. JONES:  Can the same agreement cover whatever

   draft --



                                                                           78



            MS. WILKINSON:  Of course, any draft transcripts will

   be covered by your request.

            THE COURT:  You know, I don't think you need the

   agreement because when it's only a draft transcript, then the

   accuracy hasn't been established.  Obviously, the tapes are the

   evidence of what the statement was.  Best evidence.  And I

   don't allow lawyers to cross-examine on some unagreed or

   unauthenticated transcript of the tape.  You don't need

   agreements for things like that.  I'm here.  Will be here.  I

   hope.  Proceed.

            MR. JONES:  Thank you, your Honor.  Your Honor, I'll

   let Mr. Wyatt address the next issue, if I may.

            MR. WYATT:  Your Honor on pages 20 and 21, there are

   requests for information concerning the inert explosive device

   which was a training device.  I'm not saying it was an

   explosive at all.  I believe Ms. Wilkinson has --

            MS. WILKINSON:  Are you bypassing number 9?  Or is

   that -- have we answered all those, all the rest of them?

            THE COURT:  I think we're on 10 now.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I just wanted to make sure they have

   addressed all of them.

            MR. WYATT:  I believe we've addressed number 9.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Excuse me.

            MR. WYATT:  Your Honor, on number 10, what we are

   requesting is information that regards the discovery or



                                                                           79



   location of any ammunition or any type of explosive device,

   training or otherwise.  We recognize the Government's statement

   that this training device was inert and was not armed, but the

   question is from our expert's standpoint, was that device ever

   an armed device?  We don't know, but if it was, there's a good

   possibility based on trace residue analysis that that

   particular item could have left contamination.  The same goes

   for any ammunition because black powder, which is contained in

   most ammunition, has nitroglycerine in it.  There are findings

   of nitroglycerine here.

            THE COURT:  You don't have to go through all that.

   What you're asking is whether these inert devices were ever

   active or capable of being activated.

            MR. WYATT:  Correct, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  Actually, you're talking about spent;

   right?  Those things that have already been spent, whether it

   was the explosive charge in them --

            MR. WYATT:  Well, they said that it was an inert

   training device.

            THE COURT:  I got you.

            MR. WYATT:  I don't know --

            THE COURT:  Do you understand what's being asked,

   Ms. Wilkinson?

            MS. WILKINSON:  I believe.  I guess it's different

   from what was asked in the papers.  They are asking whether the



                                                                           80



   device at any point --

            THE COURT:  Yeah.  Like a shell casing or something

   like that.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Well, in terms of ammunition versus

   inert device, I think those are two separate things.

   Ammunition recovered, anything that we took possession of is on

   the 1B list and they have seen.

            Other things, if agents themselves were in the

   building, had the ammunition, and left with that ammunition,

   obviously, we don't have custody or control of that.  We don't

   intend to introduce any findings about nitroglycerin at the

   scene for that very reason, so it's irrelevant as to the

   Government's case in chief.  In terms of the inert training

   device, I couldn't tell you whether that device at any prior

   time could have --

            THE COURT:  Check it out.  I know sometimes they have

   displays of something like, you know, a pipe bomb or something

   that was used somewhere and how they have got -- it's been

   disarmed or something like that.  So I think it's just a

   follow-up to what you mean by inert.  Okay.  You'll provide

   that.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, with respect to number 11,

   that probably would -- some of the same things as in the motion

   relating to mass intelligence data and may we simply defer that

   to the --



                                                                           81



            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MR. JONES:  -- hearing on that?

            I believe 12 has been resolved by their response

   except at the top of page 24, their response, your Honor, and

   perhaps this is just a semantic difference.  The sentence is,

   We are not aware of any documents responsive to this request.

   Typically, throughout the response, what the Government says is

   we are not aware of any documents or tangible objects

   responsive to this request.  Maybe that's what was intended

   here, but I was struck by the fact that tangible objects wasn't

   mentioned.

            THE COURT:  I noticed that as well and had written

   here "any tangible items" with a question mark.  So --

            MS. WILKINSON:  I believe that was just a mistake on

   our part, your Honor, and we're not aware of any tangible items

   or documents.

            THE COURT:  Thank you.

            MR. JONES:  I believe 13 is resolved by the

   Government's response.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. JONES:  Number 14, on response -- the Government's

   response to 14(a) is that they have been provided.  (b) is it's

   withdrawn.

            THE COURT:  Yes.  There's a mistake there in the

   typing.  That's shown as 13 and it ought to be 14 on page 27, I



                                                                           82



   assume.

            MR. HARTZLER:  Right.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.  The list of the photographs

   that the Government intends to use at trial, we asked source.

   They have agreed to provide that.  That's satisfactory.

            I'm sorry.  They will not provide the source.  I

   didn't read it carefully enough.  The photographs that they

   intend to use at trial, we asked to be given the source of who

   took the picture.  Was it the sheriff's office, FBI, ATF,

   whomever.  And it's my understanding they don't want to give us

   the source.

            THE COURT:  Is that right?

            MS. WILKINSON:  I don't think -- that will be right

   when we come to trial, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  You're going to give the source of

   anything you're going to use as an exhibit, I trust.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Correct.  It may not be -- photographs

   differ, obviously, from other types of documentary evidence

   that come in.  You don't have to have a photographer come in

   to -- to lay the foundation for the photograph depending on

   who's going to do it.  For example, at a crime scene

   photograph --

            THE COURT:  It depends on how the photograph is being

   used.  If it's only being used to identify a scene, this would



                                                                           83



   be testified to by the witness who says that's an accurate

   portrayal of it at a given time, you're all right.  But

   otherwise, you may be required to authenticate it.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Most of the photographs, your Honor,

   that we are going to use at trial and the ones we've collected

   come in from the photographer with the -- the list of

   photographs with a roll number and the name of the

   photographer, the photographs we got from the local police

   officer --

            THE COURT:  Let's do it this way.  If you want a --

   make a specific request for the source of any particular

   photograph that's of interest to the defense.

            MR. JONES:  All right, sir.

            THE COURT:  And then it'll be crystallized as to

   whether there's a problem.

            MR. JONES:  That's fine.  Item (d), your Honor, I

   recognize the Government may not know that yet, but we have to

   somewhere in the record here in the discharge of our

   responsibilities make a demand as to what's going to be shown

   at trial, and I'm sure they don't know that today, but

   nevertheless, we had to get it on record.

            THE COURT:  Well, that's what I'm talking about, that

   there has to be an exhibit list at some point here.

            MR. JONES:  So the question there is when will it be

   provided, but we don't have to address that issue today and --



                                                                           84



   unless -- except there is a question here with respect to

   experts.

            MR. WYATT:  There is a question with respect to

   experts, and we can address that when we go over the

   methodologies motion, your Honor, but I did want to reserve

   that right now because there is a key issue.

            THE COURT:  Well, we're staying with this particular

   motion right now.  Narrow motion under Rule 16.

            MR. JONES:  We'll defer the discussion then because

   the same item is in the methodology.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  (e) is withdrawn.  The Government

   represents that (f) has been provided.  They objected to (g).

   And we -- we'll resolve that.  It's -- I'm satisfied.  The

   Government has objected and we'll withdraw it.  (h) is

   withdrawn.  (i), I would like to reserve until we have the

   hearing on the other matters in camera.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. JONES:  The same thing with (j).  And (k), I

   believe, has been resolved.  On 1 -- I'm sorry -- (l), the

   Government says that -- yeah.  It said none withheld which are

   material to the defendant and they deny the existence of

   satellite photographs.  That keeps reoccurring and I take their

   representation that there are no satellite photographs, but

   some of the 302's indicate there were.  And I'm not sure --



                                                                           85



   maybe it's our mistake, we're not making it clear -- I

   interpreted the Government's response -- well, strike that.

            I'll say what I was asking for.  I was asking for one

   of two things.  Either pictures they have took from a satellite

   of these some 20 sites or pictures taken prior to 9:02 a.m.

   April 19 of those same sites.

            THE COURT:  By satellite?

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.  That's --

            THE COURT:  The Government satellite?

            MR. JONES:  Well, there are some private satellites,

   but satellites available to the -- yeah.  Referenced in

   1A-7814.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I'm sorry.

            MR. JONES:  That's a NASA satellite, 1A-7814.  I have

   had cases and there are some where the Government has gone to

   NASA or to other private concerns to determine if on a given

   day a satellite was passing by that might have taken a picture.

   In this particular case, the 302's suggest that there were 20

   sites that somebody asked about in Kansas and Oklahoma as to

   whether a satellite flew over and took a picture.

            THE COURT:  At that time.

            MR. JONES:  At that time or at any time in there that

   was relevant.  And that's what I was asking for.  Maybe they

   didn't understand the request.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Well, you understand the



                                                                           86



   request now.

            MS. WILKINSON:  We do, and we're unaware of any

   satellite photographs.  We have checked.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.

            MR. JONES:  Mr. Wyatt tells that 1A-7814 is described

   as NASA satellites, but we can resolve that at the break and

   see what it is.  That's where we got it from.

            (m) through (q) was withdrawn -- or are withdrawn.

            The Government objects to (r), which was a list of gun

   shows purportedly attended by Mr. McVeigh and Mr. Nichols from

   January 1991 through 1995.  We believe that they have such a

   list; and again, we were simply trying to save time and not

   construct our own list.  There are hundreds of people that they

   have interviewed concerning whether they were or were not

   present.  That's what makes us think they have it.  Just a time

   saving.  But they may be right, it's -- strictly speaking,

   we're not entitled to it.

            THE COURT:  Well, do you have such a list?

            MS. WILKINSON:  I'm not aware of such a list, your

   Honor, but we may have a partial list where we tried to keep

   track of the defendants' whereabouts.  We would have to go back

   and create this list.

            THE COURT:  No.  I -- I think you're being asked for

   what you have that fits in this general description.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I'm not aware of a master list of all



                                                                           87



   the gun shows attended by the defendants.

            THE COURT:  Well, you have a partial list?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.

            THE COURT:  Will you provide that?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Sure.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. JONES:  (s) is withdrawn.

            (t), they said access would be provided, and that's

   resolved.

            (u), we identified a -- a particular Government

   document which we don't believe is generally available to the

   public -- let me look here precisely at (u).  (u), we

   understand that it's entitled Arson and Explosive Incident

   Reports, published by the BATF 1995.  And they said in their

   response prosecution does not have this.  Let me just be sure

   that that's correct.  I wondered surely the Government has it.

   And I -- that was --

            THE COURT:  Was this some kind of a publication?

            MR. JONES:  I think it's a publication, but I don't

   think it's a public publication.  I don't think you can buy it

   from the Government Printing Office, but it purports to analyze

   arson explosive incidents for the previous years or year in

   this case.

            THE COURT:  Well, Ms. Wilkinson, you don't have it.

   Do you know whether BATF or anybody has it?



                                                                           88



            MS. WILKINSON:  I don't know, your Honor.  I wonder if

   Mr. Jones is getting this from a media report or somewhere.  I

   mean, I would assume, knowing law enforcement, that they

   publish general reports analyzing criminal incidents.

            THE COURT:  And make them go out to other law

   enforcement agencies.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I don't see how it's relevant under

   Rule 16.

            MR. JONES:  We learned of its existence through other

   experts who say they routinely publish this and do send it out.

   We're investigating certain incidents which occurred --

            THE COURT:  I ask -- ask the agency if they have it;

   and if they have it, we can make it available.  I don't see

   any -- if it goes out to law enforcement people --

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I've just been informed

   that it's available to the public.

            THE COURT:  Okay.  Where is it available?

            MS. WILKINSON:  I would assume if you write to the

   ATF --

            MR. JONES:  Well, it's a public document.  We'll take

   responsibility for it.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  We understood it was not, but we'll pursue

   it.

            I believe we were on (v).  The Government objects to



                                                                           89



   this.  What we asked for was access to samples of debris from

   the Murrah Building which were buried in and around Oklahoma

   City.  That's an important request.  The Government buried at a

   site in Oklahoma County, I believe it is -- but Mr. Ryan can

   correct me -- the debris from the Murrah Building.

            THE COURT:  You mean like just to dispose of it?

            MR. JONES:  I believe that's what they did.  They

   saved 7,000 pounds.

            THE COURT:  Uh-huh.

            MR. JONES:  The Court may remember that we asked

   permission to view the site and -- but substantial -- as a

   matter of fact, I think all matters of evidentiary value had

   been removed from the Murrah Building.  It was necessary to

   delay the implosion, and the crater was covered up the day we

   inspected the building or attempted to inspect it.  We don't

   want to go over and dig up the debris.  That's ridiculous.  But

   there may be some items there that we'd at least like to spot

   check and to be sure that there's nothing there that's of

   evidentiary value in a scientific and forensic examination, and

   that's all we were asking for.

            THE COURT:  Well, it's not clear to me what you're

   asking.  I -- you're talking about things that have been

   covered over?

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.  They were buried.

            THE COURT:  Well, how -- I don't understand the



                                                                           90



   request.  Is it --

            MR. JONES:  Well, we asked them --

            THE COURT:  They didn't tag everything before they

   buried it.

            MR. JONES:  No.  And, your Honor, we asked them not to

   do it until we could get our experts there and --

            THE COURT:  All right.  But it's been done.

            MR. JONES:  It's been done.  And there may be some

   core samples or material that we would like to just spot check.

   I don't know the condition of the site other than through the

   photographs, but we would at least like to have access to it.

   Whether we do any digging or not, we can discuss later.

            THE COURT:  Well, I don't see how the Government can

   respond to this unless it has some kind of inventory of what

   was hauled off and buried or covered over, whichever.

            MR. JONES:  I don't know whether they have an

   inventory or not, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  What process was used there?  Can counsel

   advise us?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, your Honor.  The day of the

   bombing, the FBI and the local agents began collecting all the

   evidence.

            THE COURT:  Sure.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Approximately May 5, the building --

   after all the evidence was recovered, the deceased were removed



                                                                           91



   from the building, and the agents were satisfied that the

   complete evidence recovery had been done, the building was

   imploded because of safety concerns.  Three additional deceased

   were removed after that point.  Any additional evidence that we

   could not get to because of the safety concerns were recovered

   and then the building -- the debris, as Mr. Jones calls it,

   which I believe is really just the actual portions of the

   concrete, and the building were buried.  I can't --

            THE COURT:  Some hauled away and some buried at the

   site?  Is that --

            MS. WILKINSON:  I don't believe any was buried at the

   site.

            THE COURT:  It was hauled away and disposed of.

            MS. WILKINSON:  So to disturb -- I'm not aware of any

   inventory, and I don't know how you would inventory it even if

   you wanted to.  I can't imagine --

            THE COURT:  Well, I think the answer is that it's not

   feasible to do what you're suggesting.

            MR. JONES:  It may not be.  And as I say, we didn't

   have access to it, and that's why we raised it.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  We'll move on then.  Your Honor, Mr. Wyatt

   will address (x) and (z).  (y) has been withdrawn.

            MR. WYATT:  Your Honor, with respect to the request in

   paragraph (x), a number of the FBI 302's actually identify a



                                                                           92



   document or an attachment to the 302 -- that's at the bottom of

   page 26, your Honor -- they identify an attachment or a

   document which was seized or obtained from a witness.  We are

   not asking for any 1A items which would include the field notes

   or things of that nature.  We only want the items which will

   help us understand what the context of the 302 is.  When they

   say the following item is attached and we don't have that item,

   you cannot read it in context, and that is what we're asking

   for in paragraph (x).

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, we've already agreed to

   provide it.  It's been on the 1A inventory.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. WYATT:  With respect to paragraph (z), your Honor,

   there has been an objection or -- a dispute between the parties

   as to the source of the evidence, and that is something

   Mr. Jones and Ms. Wilkinson both addressed to the Court this

   morning.  However, there is a possible way to resolve this

   quickly and that is that with each piece of evidence, it is my

   understanding from previous cases, not this one, there is a

   form -- an FBI Form FD-340B, which is a chain of custody form,

   which would show, 1, where the item came from and who has

   handled it in the interim.

            Now, the Government has an objection apparently to who

   has handled it in the interim as being some type of work

   product, and we would dispute that to the extent it applies to



                                                                           93



   our expert analysis because the handling of those items can

   impact the examination when you're talking about trace

   explosive residues.

            THE COURT:  Are you talking about things that are

   going to be offered in evidence --

            MR. WYATT:  Yes, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  -- and not everything else?  With respect

   to things that are going to be offered in evidence, this

   information would be necessary.

            MR. WYATT:  With respect to those items offered in

   evidence and certain items that we may designate that our

   experts may need, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  Well, you should designate them.  What

   this is asking for, as I read it and as I think the Government

   responded to it, you're asking for that kind of information

   with respect to everything that's on the list.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, Mr. Wyatt is correct that we

   certainly want those, but I myself drafted that one, and that's

   what I intended.  And the reason I intended -- your Honor is

   correct -- for everything was the Government had some concerns

   and we've discussed it this morning about this index showing

   the source.  Well, from my own experience in these cases, I

   know that the FBI has this form which will show the source.

   And then it's routinely on the outside of the brown envelope

   that has the document in it, it'll say source, Jim Manspeaker,



                                                                           94



   received such and such, transmitted by.

            And so I thought, well, rather than go through this

   index and worry about this source, if we can just get a xerox

   copy of these -- I believe their color is green -- green

   sheets, then we would know the source of an item and whether it

   came from Steve Colborn or Roger Moore or Tim McVeigh or

   anybody else.  And the reason we wanted all of them was because

   when we got all of them, then we would be able to know which

   ones we needed to study specifically, either for a motion to

   suppress or to be examined by our experts.

            So it was simply a way to save the Government's time

   not to go back and redo the source listing because the source

   listing is on this form.  So we just get a xerox copy of the

   form, we would have it.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I believe the document

   that Mr. Jones is referring to is the document where we write

   down who looks at the evidence after we take custody of it for

   future chain of custody purposes if there is any dispute.

            THE COURT:  Right.

            MS. WILKINSON:  On that list, the source is the same

   source that Mr. Jones received on the 1B list.  We don't change

   that document.  That's how we get that information onto the 1B

   inventory that we provide to the defense so it's not going to

   give them any new information other than once we received it,

   did Mr. Hartzler come in and take a look at it, did an expert



                                                                           95



   come and take a look at it.

            THE COURT:  I see.  That's why you're claiming work

   product.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Correct.

            MR. JONES:  If that's not what it is, then that's not

   what I remember.  There surely is a document that the FBI

   writes down where they got the item from that's inside that

   envelope.

            THE COURT:  From what she just said, you got that in

   your list.

            MS. WILKINSON:  And in a 302.  That's when the agent,

   Agent Smith, says I picked up the rear axle, you know, in front

   of the Regency Towers.  That's where that information is.

            MR. JONES:  It hasn't been my experience, but I'll

   accept her representation.

            THE COURT:  What's on the list, you know.  You know,

   they are saying it's on the list.  It either is or isn't.  So

   I'm going to assume it is.  And then, if there's a need for

   further information particularized as to a given item that is

   going to be used at trial, that's a different issue.

            MR. WYATT:  Your Honor, with respect to items which

   they have stated relate or are contaminated with or have

   findings of certain chemicals, could we also submit those to

   the Government whether they are intended to be offered --

            THE COURT:  Well, you can ask for specific things that



                                                                           96



   are material to the defense in the language of the rule because

   they are going to tie up to some examination that you're

   intending.

            MR. JONES:  The Government has responded to (aa) and

   say they have given it all to us, and we'll accept their

   response at this time.

            Same on 15, your Honor.

            Same on 16.

            And that brings me down to 17.  Mr. Wyatt will address

   17, your Honor.

            MR. WYATT:  Your Honor, the indictment specifically

   identifies certain stolen property which they intend on proving

   up as overt acts, and we simply want to know what those items

   are.  The Government may be correct that this is more in the

   line of a bill of particulars, but we believe that we're

   entitled to that information for purposes of our defense.

            THE COURT:  You're talking about what was stolen for

   particular overt acts or other paragraphs of the indictment?

            MR. WYATT:  I believe it just relates to the overt

   acts, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  I don't see why that isn't discoverable.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I believe, your Honor -- your Honor,

   it depends on whether we're going to introduce all of that at

   trial.

            THE COURT:  No.  Not -- I don't agree with that.



                                                                           97



   You're saying that certain things were stolen from the certain

   place at a certain time.  What things?  I mean, they are

   entitled to check that out to see if their information is the

   same.

            MS. WILKINSON:  We can do that, your Honor.  We also

   have the records available.  I believe they are talking about

   the robbery of Roger Moore, and there are --

            THE COURT:  Well, that might not be all.  There's

   several of these alleged.

            MS. WILKINSON:  We also have police reports that

   document that.

            THE COURT:  Right.  Well, so --

            MS. WILKINSON:  Which they have.

            THE COURT:  Respond to that.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, Mr. Hartzler is reminding

   me to go further with the point I was just making, which is

   that we've already provided the police reports that document

   the property that was stolen.

            THE COURT:  What I want you to do is to tell the

   defense what you say was stolen on those days, what the

   indictment refers to.  All right?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, sir.

            MR. JONES:  Item 18, your Honor, the -- as I read the

   Government's papers, apparently, the allegation is that

   Mr. McVeigh's motive for this offense was his views of the



                                                                           98



   Government conduct at Waco.  And so we asked --

            THE COURT:  What are we on?  18(a)?

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.  18(a) and (b).  So we asked for

   all of that and material that the Government had concerning

   Mr. McVeigh's presence at Waco, which is, I don't think,

   disputed at various dates.  And the Government has given us

   material, and they do say that we are not aware of any

   documents responsive to this request and in the possession of

   the Government that have not been made available.  And we do

   have some, but I was again struck by the omission of the word

   "tangible items," which of course might imbue video film or

   photograph or something else.  And I just wondered if the

   omission of the words "or tangible items" from the last

   sentence at the bottom of page 31 was by design or inadvertent.

            THE COURT:  Well, I don't see "tangible items" in the

   request.

            MR. JONES:  That's my point.  It's not in there.  But

   a photograph would be a tangible item.

            THE COURT:  But your request is for reports,

   documents, notes, photographs.

            MR. JONES:  Or films.

            THE COURT:  Or films.  Okay.

            MR. JONES:  And I think of that as a tangible object

   as opposed to a document.  Maybe it's just my own glossary.

            THE COURT:  You've given a list of the things.  The



                                                                           99



   Government's response, as I interpret it from the language that

   I'm reading, is that they are not aware of anything else --

            MR. JONES:  Okay.

            THE COURT:  -- that has not been already provided.

   That's your answer.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.  To be clear, your Honor, we have

   disclosed a videotape of Mr. McVeigh at Waco.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MS. WILKINSON:  And a newspaper article where he was

   interviewed, so there is some information responsive --

            THE COURT:  Yes, and you don't have anything that you

   haven't already given, is what you said.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Right.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. JONES:  Number 19, your Honor:  We received of

   course, this material yesterday.  And I had a question, though,

   about it, if I might just address it to the Government.

   Ms. Wilkinson, in reviewing the letter that accompanied it, I

   didn't see that included were the results, a report of the

   results.  Is there no written report of the results, or is that

   somewhere else, or is it just not listed on --

            THE COURT:  Are you asking an interpretation?

            MR. JONES:  Yes.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MS. WILKINSON:  It's my understanding, your Honor,



                                                                           100



   that everything we received as to this type of evidence that's

   in our files, we disclosed; so if we had a report, it's

   disclosed.  If we didn't have it, obviously, we can't disclose

   it.

            MR. JONES:  My question is, the FBI's very cautious

   and conservative with those reports.  And she said what we

   received.  I want to be sure the FBI, if they had a report,

   gave it to her.  I'm sure she gave me everything she got.  The

   question is did she get everything.

            THE COURT:  Well, I -- I'm operating on the assumption

   that you've asked the pertinent -- the relevant agency for the

   information.

            MR. JONES:  It just seems strange to me there's no

   report on these multiple polygraph examinations.  That they

   took it, and after looking at it, they decided A, B, C, was

   deceptive or not deceptive.

            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may I address that?  I looked

   at those items last night.  We received 57 polygraphs.  Only 11

   of them had the questions attached.  The rest were just the

   polygraph charts, which are worthless without the questions.

   And none of them have the report or the result.  Talked with

   Ms. Wilkinson, and she said well, That's all the FBI gave us.

   The FBI has the list of questions, and they have the report and

   the result.  They just haven't given them to the prosecutors,

   which merely copied them and forwarded them to us.  And that's



                                                                           101



   been common throughout this, I would point out.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, why don't I over the break

   research this and get back to the Court?

            THE COURT:  Good.  Thank you.

            MR. JONES:  Mr. Wyatt would like to address 20, your

   Honor.

            MR. WYATT:  Your Honor, I believe that we can withdraw

   all of the requests except as to paragraph (d), based on the

   Government's responses; but paragraph (d) is a unique animal.

   The Government says they don't intend on using any results from

   the Dipole Might project; and I assume that's based on the

   Court's order at the previous hearing that certain recent tests

   could not be used.  However, the Government expressly reserved

   the right to use certain evidence from pre-1995 or 1996

   tests --

            THE COURT:  Right.

            MR. WYATT:  -- as I understood it.  And we would like

   to have access to that information, and that is the purpose of

   that request, your Honor.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I believe Mr. Wyatt is

   confused.  Dipole Might is a study conducted by the ATF.  It

   has nothing to do with the Socorro testing, which was the

   subject of the suppression hearing.

            THE COURT:  Which was the British --

            MS. WILKINSON:  Correct.  That was the British.



                                                                           102



   Dipole Might has been conducted by the ATF for several years.

   And we do not intend to rely --

            THE COURT:  Separate and totally independent.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Totally independent from the Socorro

   British testing.

            MR. WYATT:  Your Honor, I accept her word on that; but

   the references in that hearing were to Dipole Might, as I

   understood it; and I believe that they were part of the same

   test.  They were just done in conjunction as it related to

   these samples with other governments.  That's my understanding

   of the entire project.  And I may be totally mistaken, your

   Honor.

            MS. WILKINSON:  He is totally mistaken, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  What can I say?  All right.  We'll accept

   your representation.

            MR. JONES:  With respect to what Mr. Wyatt's looking

   at on E, I assume that we have all documents relating to the

   matters requested from the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo

   Park, California.  Is that -- if I may ask through the Court,

   is that what was intended by your response?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, we've turned over everything

   we've received from Mr. Holt, who is the expert, although we

   have been informed by him that he is publishing an article

   showing that the seismic data showed there was one explosion.

   And when we receive a copy of that document, even though it's



                                                                           103



   public, we'll provide it to the defense.

            MR. JONES:  Their seismic data shows there were two

   explosions, and that's what we are interested in.  My question

   is -- this is my concern -- is whether we are getting

   everything these agencies have.  I'll -- and I just again state

   that that is our overriding concern: that the Government relies

   on what somebody gives them their expert without knowing

   whether that's everything that's there.  We then relied that we

   got everything, only to find out later there was something

   else.  Ms. Wilkinson says they have got everything.  I don't

   have any choice but to accept it.

            THE COURT:  That's right.  Neither do I.  And I made

   it clear -- and I'm sure it's well understood -- that, you

   know, all of these Government agencies and so forth speak

   through Counsel, who are representing the United States in this

   case.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, could I just clarify one

   thing as to the seismic data?  I believe Mr. Jones referred to

   him as our expert.  We have informed the defense, we do not

   intend to present Mr. Holt or anyone about seismic data.  We do

   not believe it's in question.  Obviously, the defense can raise

   that as an issue at trial if they want to.  This is not a

   person who is going to be an expert on behalf of the

   Government.

            THE COURT:  Is this somebody that works for the



                                                                           104



   Government and they are going to publish something?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Because there's been what I would call

   uninformed speculation about the seismic data and what it

   shows, he and his colleagues are publishing an article

   interpreting the data Mr. Jones is referring to to say that it

   shows --

            THE COURT:  When?

            MS. WILKINSON:  -- there was one explosion.

            He informed us several months ago he submitted it for

   publication; and the first time, they would not accept it

   because they didn't think it was an issue in dispute.  And he

   resubmitted it, and he said it was accepted for publication;

   but we -- I have not been informed as to when it will be

   published.

            THE COURT:  Well, I think you better find out what's

   in it first to make sure that it's not in violation of the

   order with respect to extra-judicial statements concerning this

   case.

            MR. JONES:  We -- we do have a concern about that.

   And this is perhaps just the place to -- to raise it.  And I

   don't want to delay discussion on this, but the Government

   filed its response on Monday or Friday.  And they made two

   statements.  That's a response filed in court.  One of them

   says as the Government has no prior knowledge of bombing

   warning.



                                                                           105



            Well, they surely know that's in dispute.  I mean,

   we've asked to interview three Government employees two months

   ago, and we haven't even received a response.  That goes to

   that very issue at the Department of Justice, where a phone

   call was received before the bomb went off according to a 302.

   I don't know whether it's accurate.  That's what the 302 says.

   Secondly -- I just that as a press release for the

   prosecution's theory.

            Secondly, there is a dramatic story about an elevator

   falling eight floors.  It didn't fall eight floors.  We have

   the report.  And -- and to put something into the press record

   which is then carried in dramatic fashion to the newspapers

   about this ATF agent to paint this story when the report we

   have disputes it -- and if there is a report that disputes

   that, we don't have it.  And now we find that -- these

   statements that well, it's not seriously in dispute.  There's

   one explosion.  It is.  There's respectable scientific opinion

   at the University of Oklahoma exactly to the contrary.  The

   seismic reading is like a polygraph.  It depends on the

   examiner.  They are entitled to their position; but to argue

   that well, it's not seriously in dispute, of course it's

   seriously in dispute.

            THE COURT:  Well, I'm only at this point cautioning

   that publication, if it's in the form of some opinion with

   respect to it and that opinion is relevant to the issues in



                                                                           106



   this case, I would not expect to see such a publication by any

   Government official or employee.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, No. 21, we first requested the

   names, current addresses, and current telephone numbers of the

   known survivors of each deceased victims, which I assume is in

   the 22 list -- 2200 list.  The Government has advised us that

   approximately 45 of those people may be called to testify if

   and when the stage -- we go to the second stage.

            Mr. Nichols' lawyers raised a motion, which we will

   join in concerning, these meetings that were held in Oklahoma

   City on Sunday and Monday night.  And those people are

   witnesses.  Some of them are fact witnesses, certainly on the

   second stage.

            And I just don't believe that it is right that the

   Government have the exclusive list of the phone numbers and

   addresses of victims, many of whom make public statements to

   the television camera who seek to join these proceedings in

   amicus curiae, who seek to intervene and who then go out and

   talk to the press about what happens in Government meetings.

   Some of these people, we would like to interview.  We don't

   have a way to reach them, and I don't think we're required to

   write the Government and say -- because we sure don't have any

   luck with Government employees, and I don't think we're going

   to have any less luck here.  But we don't know who these people

   are, and they are very key.



                                                                           107



            They have invoked jurisdiction of the Court to aid

   them.  And we're certainly going to treat them with respect and

   dignity.  And I suspect that our first approach to them would

   simply be to write them and ask them if we could talk with

   them.  We are not going to show up on their doorstep.  And we

   need that.  It's material to the preparation of the second

   stage and might conceivably be material to the preparation of

   the first stage.

            THE COURT:  Well, we've got several things mixed

   together here; but, certainly, with respect to witnesses,

   you're going to have to provide the information as to all

   witnesses expected to be called.  When it comes to all of the

   others, I'm -- and this matter of meetings and so forth, we'll

   address later, since it's the subject of a motion.

            MR. JONES:  It is, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  Although I'm not sure whether Mr. Tigar

   wants to argue that.

            MR. WOODS:  We're prepared to argue it today, your

   Honor, if the Court wants to hear it.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Well, at least during this

   session, whichever day.

            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  Well, your Honor, if I could just, as your

   Honor said, that's what you're here for.  And I ask the Court



                                                                           108



   to sustain A1, 2, 3, 4, 5; that is, specifically that we be

   given the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the known

   survivors of the deceased victims to the extent the Government

   has them; that we be given the names, addresses and telephone

   numbers of all persons within the group of persons referred to

   in the death penalty notice which is on file suffering, quote,

   "serious physical and emotional injury," close quote, and so

   forth, down through it.  I submit that that material -- I can't

   imagine anything more material to the preparation of the second

   stage and certainly, may be preparation for the first stage.

            THE COURT:  Well, you've got it -- all this in a

   database -- right -- under the Victims Assistance Unit, or

   whatever it's called?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, we do.  Your Honor, we have

   agreed in our response that we would provide once we get the

   authorization from the victims and make the final determination

   the names of the victim witnesses as the Court has --

            THE COURT:  What's wrong with access to the database?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Because there's an incredible amount

   of personal information --

            THE COURT:  Well, yeah.

            MS. WILKINSON:  -- on the victims, your Honor; and I

   don't --

            THE COURT:  What about the names and address?

            MS. WILKINSON:  I think they would feel very strongly



                                                                           109



   about that information being turned over to them.  I would

   believe it's protected by the Privacy Act, unless there's some

   reason why it would be material.

            THE COURT:  You'll brief that, then.  I don't see

   this -- you know -- only the Government gets access to those

   people?  I don't understand that, particularly since some of

   them have been so vocal.

            MR. JONES:  May I -- do I understand that the Court --

   the Government will brief --

            THE COURT:  Privacy Act objection to that is the

   specific objection.

            MR. JONES:  All right.  And I presume we'll respond.

            THE COURT:  Right.

            MR. JONES:  Then may I then delay further discussion

   of 21 to the brief?

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, we have permission to

   brief any legal basis for withholding that information, not

   just the Privacy Act?

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Thank you.

            MR. JONES:  All right, your Honor.  That -- it's

   12:00.  Do you want to --

            THE COURT:  Well, I have it as two minutes -- two and

   a half minutes to twelve.  If you'd like to break early, I



                                                                           110



   guess we could.

            MR. JONES:  No, your Honor --

            THE COURT:  Well, if it saves time, that's all right.

   You have been on your feet a while.  We'll recess until 1:30.

<P> In this three-day hearing, lawyers argued over what evidence the prosecution must turn over to the defense. Prosecutors are obliged to provide the defendants any evidence they consider using in a trial as well as any information that might help the defense side. Defendant Timothy McVeigh's attorney, Stephen Jones, asked for details on negotiations between authorities and Michael Fortier, a former associate of McVeigh's who is expected to testify for the government in exchange for a plea agreement. Jones contended that Fortier changed his story as part of deal to avoid trial.</P>

                             PROCEEDINGS

       (In open court at 1:30 p.m.)

            THE COURT:  Mr. Jones.

            MR. JONES:  Thank you, Your Honor.

            THE COURT:  Ready for the next item.

            MR. JONES:  The next round, Your Honor.

            THE COURT:  Item I think I said, yes.  Wasn't looking



                                                                           113



   at it as rounds.  Yet.

            MR. JONES:  It felt like it sometimes this morning,

   Your Honor.  We're back.

            Apologize to the Court.  I had it in my hand and set

   it down.  I've got it.  I see it.  It was in my hand.

            I believe, Your Honor, that we had been on No. 21 --

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MR. JONES:  -- and that had, we had gone down through

   the 21, we had gone down through No. F.

            THE COURT:  Right.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, I'm sure the Court will

   recognize F as a request that we must file, but I believe under

   the existing case law that the Government's position would find

   sympathy with the Court.

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MR. JONES:  With respect to Item B, which was to ask

   the Government to identify persons who are subject to a, quote,

   grave risk of death, close quote, for the statutory aggravating

   factor set forth in No. 2 in the death penalty notice, the

   Government's objection was that was tantamount to a bill of

   particulars, as was Item No. 1, but I place a distinction

   between F1 and No. 5C, 5B, which appears to be addressed to a

   specific class of people.  The Government says that's

   tantamount to a bill of particulars, and I suppose that it is

   in one sense; but in the other sense, the identity of those



                                                                           114



   people to the extent that there's a specific individual or

   individuals involved, I think we're entitled to know.  If they

   mean, on the other hand, to a group, then just the identity of

   the group is sufficient.

            THE COURT:  I presume that it was a group that we're

   talking about rather than particular individuals, but I may

   presume too much.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, can I have a moment,

   please?

            THE COURT:  Yes, this is on the grave risk of death.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, he's referring to a group

   in the most general sense; that is, people who were in the

   building and the surrounding area, because due to the nature of

   the device itself, it would cause that grave risk to anyone in

   the area.

            THE COURT:  I think there ought to be some definition

   of the relevant zone, though.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I believe we could do that by the

   damage, your Honor.  Perhaps that would be the best way to do

   that.  But we'd have to consider that, I think, and get back to

   the Court.

            THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, I think the defense is

   entitled to know what zone geographically constitutes persons

   within grave risk of death.

            MR. JONES:  Item C, your Honor, they said there were



                                                                           115



   no others, and we'll accept that as a statement of the

   Government's position.

            Item E1 and 2 were withdrawn, your Honor.

            Item F, persons having knowledge, that again is, as

   the Court I'm sure recognizes, inquiry of the defense which the

   courts has traditionally disallowed.

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MR. JONES:  The Government in any event has said they

   would provide a tentative list.  Another good deed, but it

   won't go unpunished.

            Item 2, I agree that it is overbroad, and I'll

   withdraw it.

            No. 3 is withdrawn.

            No. 4, I assume that anyone that falls into this

   category we have the 302 for or similar witness statement,

   except for Mr. David Irving which is an issue, but that can be

   addressed in another setting.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I'm sorry --

            THE COURT:  I'm lost as to where you are.

            MR. JONES:  I'm sorry.  Excuse me.

            THE COURT:  What page?

            MR. JONES:  Let me ask my lawyers.

            Yes, 38, your Honor, No. 4.

            THE COURT:  Yes, I think we'll have to discuss that in

   connection with another, your other request.



                                                                           116



            MR. JONES:  That's fine, your Honor.  5, 6, 7, 8 are

   withdrawn.

            9 I believe that they may have furnished us, your

   Honor.  And if I still have concerns about it, I'll raise it,

   but I believe we have that material.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  Now, No. 10, the issue arises in this way:

   There are witness statements furnished to us from individuals

   identified here in this request who claim that the Oklahoma

   City Fire Department received certain information concerning a

   certain group of people.  That's the report that the 302 says.

   And this information came to them on April the 14th, I believe,

   or 15th.  However, the information that we have received in the

   form of these statements, it isn't clear whether in fact the

   person who allegedly called the Oklahoma City Fire Department

   was in fact a government employee acting in some official

   capacity.  And that's really all we're trying to seek there is

   does the Government have information that the person who called

   the Oklahoma City Fire Department with this information,

   allegedly, is a government employee and if so, who is it and

   what is the agency.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I'm sorry, but I'm having

   a hard time following the cryptic description.  If he's talking

   about that individual in this request, which is a public

   document -- are you talking about Harvey Weathers?



                                                                           117



            MR. JONES:  Yes.  But there's others.  Maybe I can

   clear it up this way.  But you're on the right one.  Let me put

   this this way.  There are press reports that members of the

   Oklahoma City Fire Department staff received a phone call on

   the Friday before the bombing, on Wednesday from an individual

   who they inferred was a government employee, and I think

   specifically the FBI, warning them as to or alerting them or

   advising them that there may be a certain group of people or

   incident the following week.  And the Court will appreciate I'm

   trying to be somewhat general here.  The material that the

   Government has given us says that Harvey Weathers and these

   other people say, yes, that's true, we did receive such a call

   and it did say such and such concerning an event that could

   happen next week.  My question --

            THE COURT:  This in the form of 302?

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.  First we learned about it in

   the press; and then when we got the 302, the 302's were

   consistent with the press accounts.

            The material the Government gave us does not identify

   whether in fact some employee of a government agency made the

   call to the Oklahoma City Fire Department or is this somebody

   else totally unrelated to government.  If there is a call from

   a government employee, from a government agency, particularly

   FBI or the ATF or whoever, alerting the Oklahoma City Fire

   Department, it goes to the issue perhaps of prior warning or



                                                                           118



   prior knowledge.

            THE COURT:  So your question is who called?

            MR. JONES:  Well, I don't know if the Government knows

   that.  My question is narrower than that:  Did a government

   employee call?

            THE COURT:  If you know.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Judge, we don't know.  We have put all

   the investigative material into the 302's and disclosed that to

   the defense, whatever we have on this issue.  I'm not sure that

   the facts as Mr. Jones is saying them are accurate; I'm not

   saying they're inaccurate, I'm not familiar with all those

   302's.  I know any information we did investigating these

   claims, they received calls at this time, have been documented

   in the 302's and we provided them.

            THE COURT:  Did they have a practice of recording the

   calls like if it's a 911 call?

            MS. WILKINSON:  I have no idea, your Honor.  I believe

   it's the Oklahoma City Fire Department, and it doesn't sound

   from Mr. Jones' descriptions as if this was an emergency call.

   It sounds like one law enforcement agent to another.

            I know generally, as the Government has put forth in

   its brief, that when the marshal service receives threat alerts

   that they send to the courts and to other government agencies,

   they usually come to the chief judge of the district, they go

   to the U.S. attorney's office, and to the locals to warn them



                                                                           119



   about any perceived threats.  If this is related to that, I'm

   not sure it occurred at the time period Mr. Jones is

   discussing.

            THE COURT:  I think, the way I understood the request,

   it is to the Oklahoma City Fire Department.

            MR. JONES:  Yes, but --

            MS. WILKINSON:  We turned that information over to

   Mr. Jones.

            THE COURT:  And you're asking if the person identified

   as the caller is a government employee?

            MR. JONES:  Exactly.  In other words, did some branch

   of the federal government warn or advise the Oklahoma City Fire

   Department that there might be a serious criminal incident in

   Oklahoma City relating to terrorist activity the following

   week?

            MS. WILKINSON:  We are unaware of anything of that

   nature, your Honor.  We are aware of a warning that came out

   from the marshal service in March, which was based on some

   general information received at a public forum.  About the

   conviction of the sheik in New York City and the other

   convictions of the terrorists that bombed the World Trade

   Center.  And in an abundance of caution, they sent that out

   throughout the country.

            The only information that they had that was general

   was that there was some indication that the target could be



                                                                           120



   Washington, D.C., but the marshal service said in their memo,

   they were to send it around the country.  And that information

   was disseminated, I believe in Oklahoma City as well as

   everywhere else in the United States.  We have a copy of that

   memorandum, and we have said in our pleadings that we would

   submit it ex parte for an in camera review.

            MR. JONES:  Perhaps we can take up the subject of this

   in the later hearing.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  No. 11, that's all we know about it.

   There's information that came to us from the press accounts and

   other material, and we ask the Government, this would appear to

   be an indication of some type of threat to another facility in

   Oklahoma City in the month of April 1995.

            THE COURT:  That's what this in quotes refers to?

            MR. JONES:  Yes, that's how it's identified.

            THE COURT:  And is that some kind of memorandum, Miss

   Wilkinson, Threat Con C?

            MS. WILKINSON:  I don't know, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  Is that a meaningful term to you?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Not to me.  It could be to someone in

   the Air Force.  I have contacted Tinker Air Force Base, again,

   after our initial search for documents.  And they have sent us

   or in the process of sending us all of their documents relevant

   to this case.  Whether that contains information on this



                                                                           121



   alleged Threat Con C, I assume that means a threat level C on

   some scale that the Air Force uses.  But I don't know anything

   else about it, and I have no way of knowing whether that's

   connected in any way.  We'll turn over those documents that we

   receive from Tinker, if we haven't already done so, to the

   defense.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            THE COURT:

            MR. JONES:  Thank you.

            Item No. 13 is somewhat cryptic there.  I'll be a

   little more specific.  I think we've addressed it elsewhere.

   There was widespread press comment in the end of March and the

   first 15, 16 days of April, 1995, that the BATF and that

   perhaps the FBI were going to conduct a series of raids on

   militia groups and certain small religious denominations.  In

   fact, I think there was even extended article in Newsweek

   magazine about the incident.  The incident, alleged incidents,

   prompted two members of the House of Representatives to address

   a formal inquiry to the Attorney General as to whether there

   was any basis for this after the Oklahoma City bombing came

   out.

            The materiality we see to it is if such was being

   contemplated or planned, it furnishes a motive for others than

   the defendant to attack a federal installation or facility.

   And that's the reason we were asking.  I recognize that may be



                                                                           122



   something that is difficult to discuss in the public record.

   But nevertheless, there is a substantial amount of press and

   media reports that such an incident or series of incidents was

   being planned.  Whether in fact it was, I do not know.

            THE COURT:  Well, there was -- and I am a little

   hesitant here, because I don't know what was sealed material

   and what isn't.  But there was an inquiry from one member of

   Congress, anyway, that I saw to the Attorney General --

            MR. JONES:  Yes.

            THE COURT:  -- with respect to that, and I presume

   there was a response from the Attorney General to the member of

   Congress.  There usually would be.  Do you have that response?

            MR. JONES:  I don't have it, no.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I don't believe that we have that

   response, Your Honor.  I'm sure we could obtain it from the

   Attorney General's office.  But, Your Honor, I think we would

   object to providing general information about ATF or FBI

   investigations prior to the bombing without some connection to

   this case.  I mean there's a lot of investigations that could

   qualify under this general request.

            THE COURT:  Well, I was making a distinction between

   what's already been made public.  And I don't know that the

   response of the Attorney General has been made public.  But the

   member of Congress made it all public, I guess, as to his

   inquiry.



                                                                           123



            MR. JONES:  We'll wait to get the Attorney General's

   response; and if we want to pursue it further --

            THE COURT:  I'm in agreement with the Government that

   you're not entitled to wholesale information about all of the

   investigative activities of the agencies here.

            MR. JONES:  Exactly, and I'm not asking for that.  I'm

   asking for a particular type of raid that was apparently, at

   least believed well enough that a number of magazines and

   newspapers wrote about it.  So I'm not sure it was really

   confidential, if in fact there was any basis to it to begin

   with.

            No. 9, I believe that the Government has furnished

   information with respect to that issue, Your Honor.  I'm sorry.

   No. 12.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. JONES:  And No. 13, I believe we've addressed.

            Your Honor, my concern with G3 was the Government's

   response that the Government will provide the defense material

   impeaching any information as to any trial witness.  First of

   all, I thought the Court had ordered them to do that, so I

   don't understand this reference to it being in the future.

            And secondly, I'm concerned about the qualifier

   material.  What they believe may be materially impeaching may

   not be the Court's definition or our definition.  If they have

   impeaching material -- and we gave a whole category of what we



                                                                           124



   considered to be impeaching material, so they knew specifically

   what we were referring to, ranging from convictions, arrests,

   plea bargains, settlements to the IRS made during this, claims

   for the reward and so forth -- I think we're entitled to have

   it.

            THE COURT:  Well, I understood, Ms. Wilkinson, that

   you've been complying with Giglio in your materials.

            MS. WILKINSON:  We have, your Honor, as it becomes

   available.  For example, the one area where I think we have one

   dispute are criminal records.  We would like to do those closer

   to trial -- I think we discussed this at an earlier hearing --

   so we have the most accurate criminal record.  But as we

   discover other impeachment material, as we interview these

   witnesses and prepare them for trial, we'll disclose that

   information.  It's an ongoing process.

            THE COURT:  That's why you have it in the future

   tense.

            MS. WILKINSON:  That's why we have that as a future

   obligation, because our obligation continues throughout the

   trial.

            THE COURT:  That's the law.

            MR. JONES:  My concern is the qualifier materially.

   As I understood the teaching of U.S. vs. Dennis, the

   materiality of the impeaching material is to the defense lawyer

   to determine, not the prosecutor.  If on its face it appears to



                                                                           125



   be impeaching, it's to be given to us.  Whether it's credible

   or not, it's a decision that we make.

            THE COURT:  Well, yes, but I think that the issue of

   what's impeaching is on its face impeaching, as opposed to

   inferential based on some information that you have and all

   that.  I think that's where we sometimes get into a problem.

            MR. JONES:  We tried to address that issue in one of

   our motions by defining impeaching by giving a series of about

   13 examples.

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MR. JONES:  Ranging from plea bargains to

   prosecution --

            THE COURT:  Inconsistent statements, obviously.

            MR. JONES:  Exactly.  Settlements with the IRS, which

   is particularly important in dealing with one key Government

   witness.  And I want to be sure that our definition of

   "impeaching" is the same as theirs, because that's been a

   dispute throughout the proceedings.  And I would ask if the

   Court would give some guidance to the Government, as I think

   you have, that impeaching is broad, elastic concept.

            THE COURT:  Well, I'm not ready to define "impeaching"

   with all of its ramifications at the moment.  But if that's a

   legal issue that you're in dispute about it, we can address it

   and resolve it.  You know, to me --

            MR. JONES:  We can address it later, your Honor; but



                                                                           126



   to advise the Court, that list is in our motion, narrowed

   motion to compel production of exculpatory evidence; and when

   we address that, it's at page 49; and the top of page 50 is

   that, and we can take it up later.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  But that's where it is.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. JONES:  H1, 2, 3 were withdrawn.  I1 -- let's see,

   not one.

            Your Honor, I believe that L1 can be resolved -- I'm

   sorry, I1 can be resolved until we get to the co-conspirator

   issue.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  2, 3, and 4 is withdrawn.

            The Government has responded to 5 and 6 that there are

   none.  And there was no response given to no. 7.  And may I ask

   the Court if the Government could respond to request No. 7.

            THE COURT:  Let me just read it for a moment.

            Hadn't we already had this in a different request?

            MR. JONES:  It's similar but not exactly the same.  I

   assume that the Government's position is that they have such

   transcripts or recordings, that they will provide it, again

   with the caveat that we won't use the transcript for

   cross-examination.

            THE COURT:  Is that right, Miss Wilkinson?



                                                                           127



            MS. WILKINSON:  It's correct, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  Now, Item 11 and 12 are important.  I'm

   sorry.

            Yes, No. 8.  Thusfar, the Government has, I believe,

   without exception, when we have asked for a redacted copy to be

   changed so that we have the unredacted portion, that they have

   agreed to do that.  And I put that in there so that in the

   event there is a problem in the future, we will have raised it;

   but we will continue to work with the Government on that and

   see if we can resolve it.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  9 and 10 are withdrawn.  We have asked --

   it's phrased here -- we are concerned because of press reports

   that indicate that Roger Moore and Andrew Strassmeir may have

   been or continue to be informants for one of the law

   enforcement branches of federal government.  And if Roger Moore

   has been in the past an informant, I think we're entitled to

   know that.

            Now, I don't suggest he was an informant necessarily

   in this particular incident.  But the alleged robbery of

   Mr. Moore is an overt act listed in the indictment, and

   Mr. Moore apparently is a Government witness and testified in

   front of the grand jury, as I understand it.  And I think if he

   has been a Government informant for the ATF in any capacity --



                                                                           128



            THE COURT:  Well, I think maybe you need to define

   informer or informant because as I understand it from -- as I

   recall, he had a license for a certain activity and an

   obligation to provide information as a licensed dealer.

            MR. JONES:  Well, in that respect --

            THE COURT:  Are you asking whether he received

   compensation or something like that?

            MR. JONES:  Certainly that would be part of it, but I

   make a distinction between that which he has to report because

   he has a license, which would be true of anyone else with a

   similar license.

            THE COURT:  Right.

            MR. JONES:  And a situation where he is a specific

   informant with information he may pick up at a gun show or

   dealing in certain political activities or quasi-political

   activities --

            THE COURT:  So that he had a code number; is that what

   you're saying?

            MR. JONES:  Right, or gave information on alleged

   criminal conduct.

            THE COURT:  Well, those are two different things,

   though.  That's what I'm trying to suggest.  The fact that

   somebody might, because of his business activity, refer

   information to the appropriate government agency, that's one

   thing.  But if he's listed in that agency's records as a



                                                                           129



   regular source, that's a different thing.  Is that what your

   question is?

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, if Mr. Moore is a witness

   for the Government, we will disclose that information if it's

   relevant.

            THE COURT:  No, I think it's relevant now.

            MS. WILKINSON:  We haven't decided whether Mr. Moore

   is going to be --

            THE COURT:  Whether he's a witness or not.  This is

   the one who reported the robbery, right?

            MS. WILKINSON:  That's correct.

            THE COURT:  Then I think you should provide the

   information about him.

            MS. WILKINSON:  We will do that.

            THE COURT:  Because I think it goes to credibility

   with respect to that report, which is going to be a part of the

   case whether he's a witness or not.  Okay.

            MR. JONES:  Mr. Strassmeir has given newspaper

   interviews suggesting that he was a Government informant.  Now,

   all I know is what was in the newspaper.  But the Court is

   familiar -- and I want to address it now because certain in 

   camera submission that is our interest in Mr. Strassmeir

   because this is the individual that allegedly Mr. McVeigh



                                                                           130



   attempted to reach on the telephone.  So if Mr. Strassmeir at

   any time in the past has been a Government informant, I think

   we're certainly entitled to know that, particularly -- in

   addition to that because of his own political activities and

   his association at Elohim City.

            THE COURT:  Well, I think we need to take that up in

   connection with another request.

            MR. JONES:  All right, sir.  The Government on No. 13,

   we ask for a list of people applying to the $2 million reward.

   They said we were not entitled to it.  I suspect that's

   probably an accurate statement, but I think that anybody who's

   going to testify who has expressed an interest in the

   $2 million reward or inquired about it or made an application

   for it, we are entitled to know.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, we've already said at the

   last hearing and in this pleading that we would provide that

   information.

            THE COURT:  Yeah, that's what I remembered.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I said that to you the last time and

   we put that in our brief.  Maybe in the exculpatory brief.  If

   it's not stated here, we did state it in the exculpatory brief.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. JONES:  No. 15 asks for a list of financial

   benefits or incentives to be paid to informers before the trial

   or after the trial, and the Government' s response basically is



                                                                           131



   we'll provide later.  As I recall it.  I believe that's on

   page . . . 41.

            THE COURT:  I don't know, again, what you mean by

   informants here.  Witnesses?

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.

            THE COURT:  So that obviously comes in under Giglio.

            MR. JONES:  And I assume that the Government doesn't

   yet know who the witnesses are, but it seems to me that some

   witnesses are self-evident.  For a minimum, people at Elliott's

   Body Shop.  And if they have received a financial benefit or

   will receive one, I think at sometime we're entitled to that.

            THE COURT:  Sure.

            MR. JONES:  And if it's known now, I think --

            THE COURT:  Reasonably in advance of their testimony,

   so that you can investigate it.

            MR. JONES:  No. J, we withdrew.  404B and 609A, they

   indicate they will provide an appropriate pretrial disclosure

   of that so that it may be ruled upon by the Court, as I

   understand it.

            THE COURT:  Right.

            MR. JONES:  No. L1 was withdrawn.  No. 2, I think the

   Government has indicated it's forthcoming at another time and

   in advance of trial.  And we simply wanted to get our request

   on record and understand if they're not prepared to respond to

   it at this time.



                                                                           132



            And No. 3 they gave no response to.  The grand jury

   indictment alleged, I believe four times, persons unknown to

   the grand jury.  And we've asked for those identities now if

   they have become known, and the Government didn't respond to

   it, which led me to believe that there probably were none.

            THE COURT:  Well, I think, yeah, these -- these names

   have to be provided as they become known.  You agree?

            MS. WILKINSON:  We agree with that, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  No. 4, it's sort of a catchall.  No. 5, we

   addressed this morning.  That's the indices.

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MR. JONES:  And then, yes, there is an issue, your

   Honor -- where are those photographs? -- in the discovery we

   received some photographs early on --

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I believe these

   photographs were already attached to the brief.  Is that right?

   One of your earlier briefs?

            THE COURT:  I have them.  Yeah, I have them in black

   and white.

            MR. JONES:  Now, the Court may remember that earlier

   in our report to the Court last year, we attached three

   photographs that were not in the batch we received, they had

   been given to news media, who gave them to us.  And so we went

   through all of the photographs, which at that time I think



                                                                           133



   numbered 11,000, and those three photographs were not included.

   Now, they may have since been included, although I haven't seen

   them.

            Mr. Wyatt tells me that we've checked and the

   photographs that were attached to the report to the Court still

   have not been provided to us.  That is troubling to us because

   they appear clearly to be one of a series of sequence relating

   to this particular examination and calls into question whether

   in fact we are receiving everything that the Government

   represents that we are receiving.  That's the first issue.

   Now, I don't know any way to address that because I attached

   the photographs to the report and told the Court and the

   Government we didn't have them, and the Government a year later

   still hasn't provided them.  But that's a fairly subsidiary

   issue to the main one.  This appears to be -- and the Court can

   see it -- it appears to be a mockup of a Ryder truck in which

   presumably the ATF has conducted an experiment concerning the

   sequence of the explosion.

            And if you read the legends on the charts attached to

   it, you see that.  But in reviewing all of the lab material and

   the methodology material and the experiments and examination, I

   don't see any report on this incident from the ATF.  There's an

   FBI report on their theory of the explosion, but I don't see

   anything from the ATF.  There's no paperwork on this, and yet

   this obviously was an extremely important piece of work that



                                                                           134



   somebody spent a great deal of time on and took the trouble to

   measure and to record and so forth.

            THE COURT:  Well, perhaps, Miss Wilkinson, you can

   explain what are those photographs?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, these three specific

   photographs, I don't know where Mr. Jones obtained them, but

   this Ryder truck that's photographed here was rented by the

   ATF.  ETB is part of the ATF -- and they put together the

   device, a mock device so that agents who are at the crime scene

   could come look at it and see what to look for when they were

   searching the crime scene.  This was done maybe a week after

   the bombing.  There was no experiment of which I am aware.  It

   was just putting together the device based on the information

   they knew at the time.

            There is a document, an ATF chronology where they

   write up what they did day to day which includes a description

   of this device, and that has been disclosed to the defense.

   And there are photographs of this device that have been

   disclosed to the defense, I believe.  I can't say for sure

   whether these are included in that because I'm not that

   familiar with those photographs.

            THE COURT:  What I understand you to be saying, this

   was done for the purpose of giving information to investigators

   to assist in the investigation and does not reflect an

   experiment or an illustration or demonstrative exhibit or



                                                                           135



   something like that.

            MS. WILKINSON:  No, and we don't intend to produce --

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MS. WILKINSON:   -- this at trial.

            MR. JONES:  If I may, first of all, it comes from

   Volume 80 which comes from you.  It's not one word on here

   about anything to look for.  And it's kind of difficult for me

   to see how the word truck in last camera, truck travel time to

   front of building, suspect runs X number of minutes, feet has

   anything to do with looking for evidence.  That's not what this

   is.  This is an experiment in which somebody has postulated a

   theory of what happened from the time the truck left the last

   frame of the Regency Tower until the bomb went off.

            THE COURT:  Sure, but it's not unusual for those

   conducting an investigation to develop a working hypothesis and

   then instruct people to go and check things out to see if

   they're consistent with the hypothesis and seems to me what you

   have done here.  I mean not you but the government agency.

            MR. JONES:  Well, if it's just their hypothesis as

   opposed to -- it may be a hypothesis, but it's a hypothesis

   based upon certain scientific principles relating how the

   incident occurred which -- and again, I want to measure my

   words carefully -- appear to be somewhat in conflict with

   certain reports we've received from the FBI.

            THE COURT:  I'm accepting the explanation that's been



                                                                           136



   given to me by counsel for the Government.

            MR. JONES:  All right, sir.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, could I just ask that

   Mr. Jones clarify because I think I'm confused.  I thought at

   first he never received these photographs, and now he's

   saying --

            MR. JONES:  I'm saying that there are more photographs

   than this, that we never got them from you, that were given to

   us by a news agency that got them from the ATF and we compared

   them.  And in the group we got, those three photographs are

   never included and we've never gotten, and that leads us to

   believe that there are more photographs.

            MS. WILKINSON:  These are not the three you're talking

   about.

            MR. JONES:  I got them from a news agency.  I've never

   received them from the Government, but they're obviously the

   same incident and they're attached to the report that we filed

   last October.  December.

            THE COURT:  I can't go beyond what I've already said.

   I'm relying on counsel for the United States and the

   representation made.  And we don't expect to see these

   photographs coming in in connection with some forensic

   testimony.

            MR. JONES:  Item 2 and 3 I think would be best to take

   up at another time, your Honor, when we take up the other



                                                                           137



   matters.

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MR. JONES:  And I believe that that may complete --

   let me just check here.  I believe that completes --

            THE COURT:  That's all the items I had.

            MR. JONES:  Yes, that completes Rule 16, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  Okay.  Then I think you can turn to, if

   it's necessary, Mr. Woods, to Mr. Nichols' discovery motion

   which dealt with these categories.  And I do hope that I'm not

   going to be asked to make a finding about whether there was an

   agreement.

            MR. WOODS:  No, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. WOODS:  Apparently they've agreed to turn over the

   grand jury testimony, so that is moot.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I believe -- and Mr. Jones has agreed

   if we do that, to provide us the tapes and transcripts from his

   interviews.

            MR. JONES:  But I haven't heard a date by when we'll

   do this.

            THE COURT:  We'll set dates before we complete the

   hearings.

            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, I would like to echo what

   Mr. Jones said concerning the problems that he has had.  We



                                                                           138



   have the identical problems.  I want to point that out in

   relation to the timing issue that I think is material to the

   Court on the indexes and in the 302's.

            One additional problem, on the 1Bs, when I spent

   months reviewing those items, I annotated the index so that the

   index would be accurate as to what we're looking at.  And we've

   entered that into the Government's index that they have

   provided on Word Perfect, but now they've switched to Microsoft

   Access which is going to cause additional timing and delay to

   switch it to a new software program, and that's just a -- we're

   pointing that out just to the difficulties we're having.

            But I will say that Miss Vernon with the FBI and the

   prosecutors are being very cooperative on any request we make,

   any dispute we have, and trying to resolve it.  I think the

   prosecutors understand the consequences of not providing

   information in this case, that it is not to their advantage to

   withhold anything.  And apparently anything we request, we are

   receiving.  The four disputes that we had were, No. 1, we

   wanted the grand jury testimony.  But as I understand, that's

   going to be provided.

            I would like an acknowledgment on the record that when

   counsel for the Government advised the Court that they were

   going to turn over something to Mr. McVeigh, that we also be

   provided with a copy of that at the same time.  For example,

   they were going to advise the Court as to whether or not Roger



                                                                           139



   Moore's a Government informant.  We would like to learn that

   information at the same time because it affects our

   information.

            THE COURT:  Is there agreement on that?

            MS. WILKINSON:  That's our practice, your Honor.  Even

   when Mr. Jones writes us a letter just as to his client, we

   always copy the Nichols'.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. WOODS:  Usually they copy.  Yes, your Honor, and

   we appreciate that.

            The second item I had was I wanted a list of all of

   the locations where Title 3 court-ordered authorization for

   electronic interception was provided.  The Government's

   response says that we're entitled to the Alderman advice, but

   the Government has advised me -- and I believe I'm stating it

   correctly -- that they will provide that list to me.

            Is that correct, Mr. Hartzler?

            MR. HARTZLER:  Yes.

            MR. WOODS:  So that's two items out of the four.

            THE COURT:  Speaking for the Government today, we have

   Miss Wilkinson.

            MR. WOODS:  Yes, but Mr. Hartzler was the one who

   advised me this morning that he would provide me with the list.

   That's two of the four items.  The third item is notes of the

   attorneys when they interview witnesses.  And we had an example



                                                                           140



   of that last week in a deposition of a witness who came up with

   some additional information that was not in the eight FBI 302's

   that had been provided to us.  We were surprised with new

   information at the time of the deposition, and the witness

   advised, well, that he had told the prosecutor of that a couple

   months ago.

            So where a prosecutor's interviewing a witness and

   gets new information that's not in a 302, it appears to me that

   that would -- it's not work product, that's -- he's gathering

   facts, it's just like a 302, and we would request the

   prosecutor's notes of interviews with witnesses where there's

   additional information from the 302 that we have.

            And I think probably that can be cleared up by

   receiving the grand jury testimony because the grand jury

   testimony will probably omit all of the -- or cover all of

   those problems where it won't be necessary.  But there are

   going to be instances where they learned new information in

   their interviews and it's not work product.  It's just plain

   old fact gathering --

            THE COURT:  Well, there's a difference, though,

   between information in the notes and, you know, you cited the

   Goldberg case --

            MR. WOODS:  Yes, sir.

            THE COURT:  -- and the Goldberg case deals with Jencks

   Act statements and is restricted really to the attorneys' notes



                                                                           141



   where the witness or person being interviewed has in some

   fashion adopted those notes as his or her statement.  But it is

   not unusual, I would think, for a lawyer doing the interviewing

   to make notes which mix together what the witness or person

   being interviewed says and what the lawyer thinks.

            MR. WOODS:  Right, and we would not want their work

   product --

            THE COURT:  We're not talking about --

            MR. WOODS:  We just want the new information that's

   received, and that can be given to us in a 2-page, 2-sentence

   summary.

            THE COURT:  I think that's sort of under the category

   of continuing discovery where there is some information that

   explains, extends, changes the 302's or whatever the previous

   information was.  It's hard to --

            MS. WILKINSON:  It's very hard --

            THE COURT:  -- it's hard to define exactly what we're

   talking about here.  But if you, through a lawyer's interview,

   gain something that changes what this same person said when he

   or she was interviewed by the FBI or some other agent and

   there's a report of that, then I think there's an obligation to

   make that available to the defense, and that's what I

   understand your request to be.

            MR. WOODS:  Yes, it is.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, to the extent it's a



                                                                           142



   change and there's an inconsistency, fine.

            THE COURT:  Or an extension.

            MS. WILKINSON:  The problem with that, your Honor, is

   that as we are interviewing these witnesses to prepare them for

   trial -- not as an investigative interview, but to prepare

   them -- obviously as the attorney, you're asking them more

   detailed questions to prepare them for cross-examination and to

   determine the extent of their knowledge.  So there's always

   going to be more information than was contained in the 302.  I

   believe that's our responsibility as attorneys, to prepare

   these witnesses thoroughly for trial testimony.  So --

            THE COURT:  Well, I don't know what thoroughly means.

   I hope you're not video-taping them and all those things.

            MS. WILKINSON:  No, we're not video-taping them, but

   the point is to make sure we know what knowledge they have and

   what questions that they can answer.

            So if the general rule by the Court is any extension

   of the information provided in the 302, that seems impractical.

   It would be -- I mean we're always going to find out more

   detailed information from them about certain incidences.  It

   seems to me if there's a material change in their statement, a

   material addition, we can provide the defense with some --

            THE COURT:  But also if they, if you, if a lawyer were

   to go through this and hand write a bunch of notes and then say

   check this and see if it's what you just said, now you're



                                                                           143



   talking Jencks.

            MS. WILKINSON:  You can be assured, your Honor, that

   that is not occurring.

            THE COURT:  I didn't expect it to be.

            MS. WILKINSON:  We have work product in our notes, as

   you --

            THE COURT:  If it's trial preparation there, then I

   think that's true, that more detail is not a part of it.  But

   where it's -- you know, you've learned something new or

   different from what's in the reports that has -- the defense

   already has, then you should provide it.

            MR. WOODS:  Thank you.

            THE COURT:  I think that's as far as I can go in some

   sort of working guideline.

            MR. WOODS:  I think they'll respond to that.  We hope

   they will.  And the last item we requested is a list of the

   witnesses for trial which is sort of moot now.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.

            MR. WOODS:  And those are the four items we've

   requested, and we have been able to work with the Government

   and obtain each and every item we have sought.  And so I do

   have the problem that Mr. Jones related with all the indexes

   and getting the 302's 500 days late.  I don't understand that

   when they acknowledge that we've given the defense 98 percent

   of the 302's.  It was my understanding of the reason we're



                                                                           144



   getting these late is because it's out in the Des Moines FBI

   office and somebody just found it 500 days later.

            So I don't know how they can say we have 98 percent of

   it.  I don't think anybody knows what percentage has been found

   and turned over to the defense.  I think it's out in some FBI

   office and that's why we're getting it late.  So that will be a

   continuing problem, but I think the Court has addressed that

   with the cutoff date.

            THE COURT:  Right.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, as to the cutoff date, we

   checked the calendars.  December 15 is a Sunday.  Could we have

   until December 18 for that?

            THE COURT:  What's wrong with the 16th?

            MS. WILKINSON:  We had previously scheduled a cutoff,

   ourselves, on the 18th.  That would just be easier for us.

            THE COURT:  All right.  That's a long time from now.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, we have already -- part of

   the reasons Mr. Jones was able to give you examples of old

   302's, as we call them, that were just disclosed, is that

   because we have been engaging in this process for the last

   couple of months, going back to the field offices and making

   sure that we have disclosed everything that was prepared.

            THE COURT:  What about the things that you've already

   got?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Those are the numbers.  When I say



                                                                           145



   98 percent or 99 percent have been disclosed, that's of the

   material we have.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MS. WILKINSON:  So we have 300 302's left, that's it,

   that haven't been shown, that haven't been provided to the

   defense.

            THE COURT:  Now, do we have to wait for December 18

   for those?

            MS. WILKINSON:  No.  December 1, just like we turned

   over material on October 31.  We do it on a monthly basis, and

   so the remainder should be turned over there.  But we will do

   the double checking to make sure that any in the process of

   being written will be disclosed.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. WOODS:  Thank you, your Honor.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, may I address one issue?

            THE COURT:  Sure.

            MR. JONES:  Perhaps the Court will think that my

   concern is unjustified, but as I listen and I try to listen

   carefully to what the Government says it will do and the

   incident that Mr. Woods is talking about is a serious one and I

   think will cause much indigestion if it's repeated during the

   trial because it clearly was exculpatory.

            This witness made eight statements to the FBI plus he

   was interviewed by us twice plus once by Mr. Woods.  In 11



                                                                           146



   statements he never mentioned a specific incident about

   Mr. McVeigh that from the Government's standpoint is very

   crucial.  For the first time at his deposition in response to a

   question, he says Mr. McVeigh did a certain act which he had

   never described.

            Then when we asked him, well, when did you first

   remember this, a year and a half after the day in question, he

   says, well, I told Mr. Mackey.  Mr. Mackey didn't tell us.

            Now, if that's not exculpatory for a witness to go

   through 11 times, 8 times with the Government and say,

   Mr. McVeigh was here, and not describe the other incident -- if

   that's not exculpatory, it has no meaning.  And my concern is

   that when the Government uses words like material, that is a --

            THE COURT:  Well, that's a different thing.

   Exculpatory, Brady obviously that's there.

            MR. JONES:  But they didn't think it was there.

            THE COURT:  No matter who was interviewing the person.

            MR. JONES:  But my point is they didn't define it as

   broad.

            THE COURT:  Well, I don't want to try that particular

   point right now.  But that is Brady, obviously.

            MR. JONES:  It is.

            THE COURT:  And if that happens at trial, there will

   be very serious consequences.

            MR. JONES:  Thank you.



                                                                           147



            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Judge, could we clarify just because

   we don't want you to have the wrong impression that we are not

   disclosing Brady.  The information that Mr. Jones -- it's

   serious for us --

            THE COURT:  Go ahead, I didn't by any facial

   expression or something try to shut you off.  If you got that

   impression, I didn't mean it.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Well, we are concerned that the Court

   accept our representations and be confident that we are

   discharging our Brady obligations.  So when Mr. Mackey went to

   do this deposition and asked this question, it was not a

   question that was exculpatory at all.  It was inculpatory of

   Mr. McVeigh and his actions.

            THE COURT:  But it's a statement that the witness

   didn't make on an earlier occasion.

            MS. WILKINSON:  But the omission, your Honor, is not

   exculpatory.  It was just further detail about when Mr. McVeigh

   was in a place and he stepped outside for a certain amount of

   time.

            THE COURT:  It may or may not be exculpatory and

   that's why I don't want to dwell on it.  But if the witness for

   the first time remembers some detail a year and a half later,

   that's certainly grist for cross-examination about the

   credibility of the witness.



                                                                           148



            MS. WILKINSON:  If, as your Honor has said, way back

   December 18 -- you were talking to us about what is

   exculpatory.  And you said lack of knowledge is not

   exculpatory.  If someone says -- in this case, he was never

   asked about whether Mr. McVeigh stepped outside or not.  So it

   wasn't as if he just remembered recently, it was that

   Mr. Mackey in preparation for the testimony asked him the

   question.

            THE COURT:  I guess that's why I was fidgeting a bit.

   I don't want to try what Mr. Mackey said to some witness and

   all of that here.  But to the extent that the incident gives

   rise to some request for guidance, again, my view is that late

   remembrance of some important detail can be exculpatory because

   it suggests that the person's recollection has been influenced

   or affected by something other than his own sensory

   perceptions.  Write that down.  That's pretty good.  Okay.

            We're ready to go on exculpatory?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.

            MR. JONES:  Are we doing exculpatory or methodology?

            THE COURT:  Actually, no, I think the next item I said

   was going to be experts, didn't I?

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir, that's what we understood.

            THE COURT:  Okay.  That's what we'll take up, the

   narrowed request for expert-witness discovery and the

   Government's response.



                                                                           149



            Now, I don't know, this, let me just -- we'll deal

   with these item by item, if you choose; but somewhere along the

   way, we were going to cull out what is necessary for a hearing

   under Daubert principles and also, of course, we have the

   laboratory matter.  And so I take it the request and the

   response is still in contemplation of our doing that.

            MR. JONES:  Yes, it's to get the material in order to

   do the Daubert.

            THE COURT:  Yes, so that we know what is necessary in

   such a hearing.

            MR. JONES:  Yes.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, we would like to present this

   in this manner.  I have a few preliminary remarks, and then

   Mr. Wyatt will take the individual -- and I will assist him --

   the individual requests.  But what I'm going to say now would

   apply to each of the individual requests so that they would not

   have to be repeated.

            I told the Court this morning when we started that one

   of the five key elements that I thought the Government would

   present in structuring its case is the forensic evidence.  And

   the fact that the Government has acknowledged that there are

   468 reports that they furnished to us is an indication of just

   how extremely important to them and to us this forensic

   evidence is.



                                                                           150



            We have with the Court's permission and order employed

   world-renowned scientists who spent their entire career either

   in law enforcement or in academic work on the subjects, and in

   this particular report, bomb residue analysis, trace analysis,

   and the bomb engineering.  And I don't think there's any

   question based upon their resumes that they are extremely

   qualified and, in fact, many of them have far superior academic

   and professional qualification than the resumes furnished by

   the Government.

            Each of them, with the exception of one, has testified

   in major world-famous -- if I could use that term, in the sense

   of notoriety -- cases involving bombing.  We submitted to them

   and sent to them the entire laboratory notes that Ms. Wilkinson

   said we got.  And they have analyzed them.  And furnished us

   letters and affidavits which we will submit to the Court.

            Now, either one of two things has happened here.

   Either the FBI laboratory does not have protocols, except on

   some oral tradition, or else we're not getting them.  Because

   they have, with painstaking analysis as scientists, gone

   through this material and pointed out the wide gaps of what is

   missing in order for them to advise us and to testify, if need

   be, at trial.

            And for the reasons set forth in their affidavit, what

   we believe has happened here is that the Government has once

   again at the 12th hour or 11th hour given us 15,000 sheets of



                                                                           151



   paper which we've gone through with our experts and said that

   the quantity of the paper means that we have received the

   quality.  And we haven't.

            In other words, that material which is absolutely

   necessary to determine whether the analysis is accurate is

   missing.  Now, it's either missing because it doesn't exist,

   which is a damning indictment, or we simply haven't been

   furnished it.

            This is critical for us, this forensic evidence.  And

   it is all the more critical for us because the Court has under

   seal and is familiar and we've addressed it in court here, that

   there are serious allegations concerning contamination,

   methodology, adherence to protocols, and qualification of the

   people performing this, serious enough that the Inspector

   General is conducting an investigation and there are press

   reports this week concerning some very damning statements that

   will be made about an individual that's going to testify in

   this case.

            Now, whether those press reports are correct or not, I

   don't know.  But that's what we've been told.  And hopefully,

   they're not correct, but, nevertheless, that's what the report

   is, the press speculation.

            But in addition to that, the Attorney General herself

   has appointed a five-member panel consisting of three

   foreigners to investigate these allegations.  So when we say to



                                                                           152



   the Court, we want the protocol to know what Mr. Burmeister and

   Mr. Williams looked for, what is the guideline that you are

   using to determine the presence of PEGN or PET or nitro or

   dynamite, what procedure do you rely upon and where is it,

   those are the protocols.  Many of these lab reports are fairly

   complete.  Some of them simply are not.  They are woefully

   inadequate.

            And I think that we are being showered with paper, but

   the important material is being withheld from us.  And in view

   of the importance of it to this case, in view of the closely

   contested issue, Mr. McVeigh's clothing and Mr. Nichols' home

   and Mr. McVeigh's automobile and Mr. Nichols' pickup, and the

   recovery of items at the scene, we cannot go into the FBI

   laboratory and perform the experiment, ourselves.  So we need

   everything.

            Now, the Government cites a couple of cases.  It says,

   well, you're not entitled to everything.  But there are cases

   that under the unique facts of those cases, which frankly

   parallel ours, we are.  And I think when there are those

   serious allegations which have been made, but not just by

   Dr. Whitehurst, but by a number of other FBI personnel, all of

   which are under the Court's in camera, that this is the one

   area where we're entitled to all of it, in order that we may

   verify it with our experts and challenge it if appropriate.

            And Mr. Wyatt is prepared to speak to the



                                                                           153



   individualized responses.  He has the letters from Dr. Lloyd,

   the affidavits of Dr. Lloyd, Dr. Caddy, and Dr. Yinon who have

   personally reviewed this material and advised us whether it is

   complete or incomplete, and I ask Mr. Wyatt to take each item.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, can I address those

   general comments?

            THE COURT:  Yes, you may.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, several months ago, we

   decided to disclose all of the examiners from the FBI, the

   laboratory examiners, all of their notes to the defense.  Those

   notes are the work product of the experts, including not only

   their handwritten notes, but in the case of the -- what I would

   call the more sophisticated scientific analysis, the chemical

   analysis by Agent Burmeister, they are the actual charts and

   printouts from the chemical residue analysis conducted in this

   case.  All of that information that was in our possession has

   been disclosed to the defense.

            Although there are thousands of pages of documents,

   very little of that evidence will be introduced in the

   Government's case in chief.  So when Mr. Jones says the

   forensic evidence is very important to the Government, I think

   that is a bit of a mischaracterization.  We have provided the

   defense with the findings that we intend to introduce at trial.

   And we hope that we will be able to limit those or narrow those

   even more as we get closer to trial.  In fact, I know we will



                                                                           154



   be able to.

            But to put it in perspective as to what these

   allegations are and the reason they need this additional

   information, if it even exists, there are only six reports of

   positive residue, high-explosive residue in this entire case.

   If you discount nitroglycerin, which we've already told you

   we're not going to introduce at the scene because law

   enforcement carries ammunition and you can't really distinguish

   it.

            So in terms of this allegation that, you know,

   contamination in the laboratory or contamination at the crime

   scene, out of the hundreds of tests that were done, I believe

   there were 404 high-explosive tests done, only six showed

   positive results.  So there is not, contrary to what Mr. Jones

   is saying, evidence of this widespread contamination.

            But as to those six tests or any other tests where

   there were negative results, if Mr. Jones is interested in that

   Agent Burmeister in notes shows how he runs the tests, he shows

   how he puts blanks into the machines, how he calibrates the

   machines, how he extracts the sample and how he runs it through

   the machine and what the machine reads so you can see the

   levels and what he determines is, for example, PETN or

   whichever one is the finding, so if the defense is asking us to

   provide additional information about those tests, your Honor,

   it doesn't exist.  If he's --



                                                                           155



            THE COURT:  I think that is the particular question as

   to whether many laboratories -- and I'm speaking generically

   here -- have a lab book with protocols as to how to run a gas

   chromatography and that sort of thing.  And what the steps

   should be.  And I think the question here is, for the tests

   that were, are of interest here, is there such a lab book

   protocol, standard operating procedure.

            MS. WILKINSON:  There are some protocols, if you want

   to call them that, general protocols.  For example, Agent

   Burmeister has a general protocol, if you find this, you test

   for that, and if that test shows positive, you test for that.

   Obviously, with alternatives, depending on the findings.  But

   that's a one-page protocol which we'll provide to the defense.

   It doesn't show what he actually did, which is why we decided

   to disclose the notes because that's what's really at issue in

   this case, what did he do in this case.

            THE COURT:  Yes, but it's also a matter of if there

   are standard operating procedures, whether there was deviation

   from them.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I think there's two different issues.

   One is did he follow the general protocol and we'll provide

   that like I said.  I tell the Court now, I don't think that

   Mr. Jones will find it satisfactory, because it's very general.

   But a second --

            THE COURT:  Whatever it is.



                                                                           156



            MS. WILKINSON:  Right.  But the second is are there

   manuals for operating the machines.  And I believe there are

   manuals generally for how to maintain the machines, but I don't

   believe in every case, there's a written protocol for how to

   operate the machine, if the Court understands the difference

   between just maintaining the machine.  And that's why Agent

   Burmeister in his tests documents how he runs the machine to

   test the levels to see that the machine is clean before and

   runs that and then runs it to see what the sample shows.

            THE COURT:  Yeah, and I would think that if the

   machine's identified, then, you know, the defense experts can

   determine whether what he did is consistent with the correct

   usage of that machine.

            MS. WILKINSON:  That's correct, your Honor, and Agent

   Burmeister identifies the machine that he used, the tests that

   he ran.  His notes are very comprehensive, shall we say, and I

   believe that one of Mr. Jones's experts -- I believe it's Mr.

   Caddy -- worked for the defense in the World Trade Center where

   Agent Burmeister was the chemist and had no, you know, problems

   with Agent Burmeister's work at that point.  So he is familiar

   with Agent Burmeister's notes, his protocols, his procedures

   that he follows.

            And that's really -- I use Agent Burmeister because

   that's really the one where it's the most sophisticated test.

   The other things, fingerprints, handwriting, tool marks, don't



                                                                           157



   involve the same type of scientific analysis that the chemical

   residue, the explosive residue tests do.  And all of that

   evidence, expert evidence will come in through Agent Burmeister

   or, you know, through some industry expert, but I don't believe

   as to the actual forensic tests, all of those will come in

   through Agent Burmeister.

            THE COURT:  When are you going to be able to identify

   the particular witnesses and tests that you're going to use at

   trial?

            MS. WILKINSON:  We've done that, your Honor, we did

   that on August 2.

            THE COURT:  You filed that notebook?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.  And one page of each notebook,

   it says the agent's name -- for example, Agent Burmeister.  It

   says he will testify that PETN was found and it gives the

   reports and --

            THE COURT:  Well, I didn't remember whether the

   notebook was narrowed down to what you intended to introduce or

   whether it was these are the possibles.

            MS. WILKINSON:  No.  Well -- this was -- possible that

   at that time we currently intended to introduce at trial.  That

   was when we thought we were going to trial against both

   defendants at the same time.

            THE COURT:  Right.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Obviously, if we can, like I said,



                                                                           158



   streamline that proof, we will do that.  We're in the process

   of doing that right now and further narrowing that list.  But

   it's not a large list.  We took all the lab reports, the 477 or

   whatever we had at the time and culled out only the relevant

   findings that we thought we would introduce in our case in

   chief.  It's a very small number.  One is because there are

   relatively few positive findings but also few that we think are

   relevant against Mr. McVeigh.  So we've done that.  For the

   defense.  And we've identified by witness.  And in fact, I sent

   them a letter -- I think at the last hearing -- removing some

   of the experts and we're going to try and narrow that list of

   experts so we'd have a couple more that would come off the

   list.  I think we're at 32 experts right now, which sounds like

   a lot, but it's really, except for the fingerprint and

   handwriting, for very few findings.

            THE COURT:  Okay.  Mr. Wyatt.

            MR. WYATT:  May it please the Court, I believe that

   many of these issues can be resolved quite quickly based on the

   representations made by the Government in their papers and Miss

   Wilkinson today.  The first issue, however, is not necessarily

   one of them.

            The Government has advised in their response to

   paragraph No. 1 at page 5 that the laboratory's address is

   identified on the papers provided.

            I am assuming based on the response that there is more



                                                                           159



   than one laboratory that has been used even within the FBI

   because the only lab that we have seen on the 477 reports is

   the FBI lab address, and that is just an issue that we need to

   determine so that our experts can examine whether different

   protocols are used in different labs and whether different

   procedures are used, and we just simply want to know the

   address of the labs to the extent they haven't been provided.

            They may have provided them to us, assuming

   Washington, D.C., is the only one together with their other

   non-FBI laboratories which they say are identified in the

   documents they provided to us.

            THE COURT:  Well, your request, you're talking about

   this A1; right?

            MR. WYATT:  Yes, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  Which asks for all FBI laboratories and

   other laboratories conducting any type of test or experiment.

   Now, the question -- I mean the request made includes all of

   these things that are negative and no -- no consequence to it.

            MR. WYATT:  Well, that's true, your Honor.  I believe

   that we could narrow that to items that are --

            THE COURT:  -- going to be used.

            MR. WYATT:  -- yes, used by the Government or

   necessary to the defense case.

            THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, I think there's a significant

   difference here based on what Miss Wilkinson told me just a few



                                                                           160



   minutes ago about how many tests were done with negative

   results.  And so that's sort of like the inserts and compared

   to the 302's.  So you can provide the information with respect

   to the forensic tests that are going to be involved in the

   forensic testimony, lab testimony.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I believe the only issue to resolve,

   your Honor -- we provided all the outside laboratories or

   outside expert when we used the industry people who perhaps

   manufactured the item we're testing -- is whether the FBI

   laboratory at headquarters did the test or Quantico, and we'll

   look into that.

            THE COURT:  You'll find that out and reveal it.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Sure.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. WYATT:  Also, your Honor, it affects an issue that

   probably should have been addressed before this.  The

   Government is correct that they have provided us 18 of the 31

   or 32 experts' papers.  So many of these issues although they

   are resolved or may be resolved as to those 18, they are still

   outstanding as to a number of others, particularly those that

   are non-FBI related, and I just mention that as a predicate

   issue because all of the documents have not been provided as to

   each expert.  And I assume based on representations of Ms.

   Wilkinson that they will be.

            THE COURT:  For those who are going to be at trial.



                                                                           161



            MS. WILKINSON:  The only exception were the people

   from the medical examiner's office.  So out of 32 experts, I

   believe that some experts have not concluded their examination,

   and that's why we do not have those notes and there are five or

   six people that fall under the umbrella of the medical examiner

   who did cause of death and identification and we are not going

   to provide those because of your ruling earlier where the

   defense had access to the medical examiner's files.

            MR. WYATT:  And to that, your Honor, I would advise

   the Court that the Government has produced the complete medical

   examiner files to us or so they've represented.  So we accept

   that representation.

            THE COURT:  Or the medical examiners did, I thought.

            MR. WYATT:  It was produced through the Government.

   It was produced through the FBI office.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I don't know whether that includes the

   notes.  We asked them for the file through the subpoena and

   provided it to them.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. WYATT:  I believe we're satisfied with those, your

   Honor.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. WYATT:  The second issue concerns the identity of

   laboratory personnel in their handling of samples and then also

   in paragraph B, the job descriptions and qualifications of



                                                                           162



   those individuals.  Your Honor, this information is necessary

   to the chain of custody, and that goes to contamination issues

   and other issues that relate to the integrity of the samples.

            We believe that those issues will be hotly contested

   based on the packaging and storage and things that we have seen

   through our own observations and based on what our experts tell

   us, and in order to establish the risk of contamination and the

   other things that are involved there, they must have a chain of

   custody, and I would advise the Court pursuant to the Liquid 

   Sugars case that is cited in our brief, that is something

   federal courts had ordered produced in these types of cases.

            THE COURT:  Well, a chain of custody, who handled it

   and what they did with it is one thing.  All the information

   about qualifications of people and all that is a different

   order of request.  And if they didn't do anything but take this

   item from one place and put it in another or take it and put it

   in a machine, you don't need to know all their qualifications,

   do you?

            MR. WYATT:  I would agree with you, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor in, those notes that we

   provided -- we'll go back to Agent Burmeister.  He's a good

   example.  He keeps a chain of custody.  When an item comes to,

   for example, a portion of the truck, he notes when he receives

   it on his notes or on his laboratory work sheet, which is



                                                                           163



   included in his notes.  If he gives it to a technician to put

   in a machine, that's noted or if he sends it to another area of

   the laboratory, that's noted.  So to the extent that that's

   documented, that's in the notes.

            We turned over Agent Williams' notes, who was

   responsible for the evidence when it first came in with his

   technicians, and he has a chain of custody.  So that

   information is in the notes that we've disclosed.

            THE COURT:  Do they keep straight from the

   technicians' notes or the agent chemists' notes a routine

   document about who handled this piece and when?  I think we get

   back to what was being talked about earlier this morning.

            MS. WILKINSON:  When it comes to the laboratory, it

   comes into the explosives units, and they start the chain of

   custody.

            THE COURT:  Don't they keep a log on that?

            MS. WILKINSON:  They keep a log.  But what happens is

   it gets sent out to the different specialists for testing.

            THE COURT:  Sure.

            MS. WILKINSON:  And they are responsible for their own

   logs.  So in other words, if Agent Williams received it and

   sent it to Agent Burmeister for chemistry and toxicology and

   explosive residue testing, he doesn't send the chain of custody

   form.  He notes it, Agent Burmeister starts his own internal

   chain of custody and sends it back.  So between those two



                                                                           164



   notes, the person's notes, you have a full chain of custody, or

   wherever else the piece is sent.  It could have gone to hair

   and fiber, it could have gone to fingerprints, and to the

   extent we have that information, it is in all the agents' notes

   as chain of custody.  They write it in different formats.  Some

   put it in their laboratory worksheet with their initials saying

   the date they received it and the date they turned it back in

   to the explosives unit.  But as much as we have it documented,

   it is disclosed.

            THE COURT:  Well, obviously, it will help facilitate

   things if we know who handled what and when.  So in whatever

   format.

            MR. WYATT:  Your Honor, in that regard, the chain of

   custody within the laboratory is only part of the issue.

            THE COURT:  I know.  You've got to get it from

   Oklahoma City to the laboratory.

            MR. WYATT:  And all of that is important to us in our

   determination.  And to the extent the chain of custody prior to

   receipt at the lab is not included, that is something that we

   are including within our request, but I don't believe the

   Government is representing that those have been provided to us.

            THE COURT:  Well, the defense needs to know how a

   particular item got from where it was recovered to the

   laboratory.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, as to that, I believe if



                                                                           165



   we could narrow it to the items, again, we intend to use.

            THE COURT:  Yes, this is staying within the universe

   of what you're going to use.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I would have to check our records,

   your Honor.  I believe some of those chain of custody documents

   were 302's that show, for example, that the evidence collected

   in Oklahoma City was put on a tractor-trailer and was driven to

   headquarters and given to the laboratory.  I believe there's a

   302 that documents that.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, we don't know who --

            THE COURT:  I think you're going to have to do this

   anyway for purposes of knowing whether you're going to have to

   go through a chain of custody in evidence, so you might as well

   do it, if you haven't done it, and provide it to counsel so

   they don't have to thumb through everything.

            MS. WILKINSON:  What we would request, your Honor, is

   only for those pieces where contamination could be an issue.

   For example, on a document where there's handwriting, I don't

   believe chain of custody from when we got it at, let's say out

   of Mr. McVeigh's car and sent to the laboratory, is relevant.

            THE COURT:  Well, it might be as to who handled it, if

   it's for fingerprints.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Fingerprints, what I was saying for

   handwriting.  It depends on the item.

            THE COURT:  Sure, it does.  You know what you have to



                                                                           166



   do with a chain of custody and what you don't under the Rules

   of Evidence.  So with respect to anything that requires a chain

   of custody before it can be admitted into evidence, then I

   think you should identify that chain rather than just say to

   counsel, it's out there in the 302's.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Perhaps, your Honor, we can work with

   the defense on those items.  I'm sure that we'll have some

   disputes about what we think requires a chain and what --

            THE COURT:  There may be, but, generally speaking, I

   think counsel know what you have to use a chain of custody on

   and what you don't.  And of course, a part of that depends on

   whether they use these sealed devices, sealed envelope devices.

            MS. WILKINSON:  For most of ours, that's true; they're

   in sealed bags.  Especially for the items that could have

   potentially had residue on them.

            MR. WYATT:  Your Honor, with respect to paragraph 2B,

   we would withdraw that and consider that resolved.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. WYATT:  As to paragraph 3 -- excuse me, your

   Honor.  This issue seems to be resolved by the production of

   the reports and by their statements, but, in fact, it's not.

   Many of the laboratory notes which have been provided --

   Mr. Burmeister is an excellent example.  So is Dave Williams.

   Those two individuals frequently refer to AE apostrophe S notes

   or dictation.  We are assuming that that refers to assistant



                                                                           167



   examiner.

            The assistant examiner, therefore, must be providing

   some type of dictation or notes concerning the procedures

   performed in this, on this particular evidence.  We could

   provide the Court with some examples of that.  I don't have

   those before me today.  But, certainly, there are gaps in the

   material to the extent there are such references made.

   Otherwise, we have to accept the Government's representation

   that all notes have been provided.

            But in those instances, it is clear that there are

   notes missing unless, for instance, Mr. Williams may be the

   assisting examiner assisting Mr. Burmeister, and that we don't

   know because it's not referenced and you cannot tell that by

   the lab reports or the notes.

            MR. JONES:  There's also a pattern to when AE is used

   which one of our experts called to our attention.  On those

   matters that appear to be irrelevant, the notes are very

   complete.  When we come to sensitive material, either for the

   Government that will help its case or might help us, then the

   papers get vague and there's references, it will just say see

   AE's notes, well, without AE being identified at that point --

            THE COURT:  Yeah, the answer here is to identify to

   AE's.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Judge, AE stands for auxiliary

   examiner.  In a laboratory in a bombing case, there's a



                                                                           168



   principle examiner who is responsible for collecting the

   evidence and distributing to the different specialists again

   for the different tests.  That's the explosive units.  They are

   the primary or principle examiner.  Auxiliary examiners are

   everyone else.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Identify who they are.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Judge, when Agent Williams says or

   Agent Burmeister sees auxiliary examiners, they're talking

   about anyone else who looked at that piece of evidence.

            THE COURT:  Well, have him identify who he's talking

   about; that's what I'm saying.  If he can't, they ought to know

   that.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I'm not sure I understand that.

            THE COURT:  It isn't very helpful to say AE did this.

   AE might be the janitor.

            MS. WILKINSON:  No, no, Judge.  I think they'd have to

   show me the records they're talking about.  But I recall, for

   example, in the explosives unit, they give a description of

   every item, so when Agent Burmeister in his notes instead of

   repeating the description, he'll just say, Refer to AE notes,

   meaning the description.

            Before you order us to identify all of these, I would

   ask that the defense show us the examples that they're talking

   about and see if we can resolve that first with that.  AE does

   not do the test, your Honor; we're not talking about someone



                                                                           169



   else doing the test.  All I'm saying is this has not been

   raised before, if we could try and resolve it with the

   defendants.

            THE COURT:  I think you better talk to Burmeister and

   see what his practice is, why he sometimes says AE and

   sometimes says somebody's name.

            MR. WYATT:  Your Honor, and it's not just referring to

   chain of custodies; it's referring to seeing his notes and

   dictation which implies that some type of testing or procedures

   were performed on that, by that person upon which the

   testifying expert will rely upon.

            THE COURT:  I understand.  I understand.  And I think

   that defense is entitled to be informed about what these notes

   mean.

            MR. JONES:  Item No. 4, we withdrew, your Honor.

            MR. WYATT:  Your Honor, with respect to paragraph 5, I

   believe that it is, for the most part, something we can agree

   to.  The, if the Government's representation is that we have

   been provided all of the laboratory notes, of course I'm

   referring to only 18 of the 31, and that we have been provided

   with all of the bases for their opinion, then we have to accept

   that.  We have no choice.  We have no dispute as to the names

   and qualifications and things of that nature.  But as to the

   subject matter of their testimony or to the notes and bases for

   their opinions, that is our sole dispute for that, but if that



                                                                           170



   is their representation, we certainly accept it.  But I can't

   tell that based upon their answer here.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I believe Rule 16

   requires, sometime prior to trial -- and we've already done

   it -- a summary of the bases, and that's what we have provided.

   And we've provided all the notes.  So again, they have all the

   information about the actual testing.  But I believe we've

   complied with the rule in terms of the summary of the bases,

   the opinions, and the credentials of each expert that we intend

   to call.

            MR. WYATT:  Your Honor, and to that extent, they may

   have complied with part of Rule 16, but we have to look at Rule

   705, because we are entitled to the underlying basis for their

   opinions --

            THE COURT:  For those who are going to testify.

            MR. WYATT:  Correct, your Honor.  And to that extent

   we need to know that is everything, not a summary of the

   underlying basis.  If they tell us that is all of it, we accept

   that.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.  Well, we do have to have the

   information relied on in support of the opinion testimony given

   when we're going to opinions under the Rules of Evidence.  So

   that is not limited by Rule 16.  Now, the rule, it doesn't

   provide that it has to be in a particular time before trial.

   And indeed, you can accomplish it by cross-examination.  But I



                                                                           171



   don't expect to take the time today that in this case, that

   you're going to be doing a fishing type cross-examination of

   these experts.  We need to get that information out before we

   ever select the jury.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I believe we have provided the bases,

   your Honor, and the data by providing the notes.  However, at

   the 703 hearing, I think also some of this can be addressed

   if --

            THE COURT:  Yeah, that's why I said at the outset

   here, that we need to cull out what has to be done at a hearing

   under 703.

            MR. WYATT:  And admittedly, much of this can be

   addressed at that, but in order to --

            THE COURT:  -- get ready for that.

            MR. WYATT:  And to avoid unnecessary delay during that

   hearing and unnecessary lengthiness.

            THE COURT:  In this area, I think that counsel have to

   discuss this further because this is not the kind of thing that

   we can just go back and forth on here in court.  You've got to

   have really the information in front of you to talk about it.

            MR. WYATT:  We'll be happy to do that, your Honor.

            As to paragraph 6, your Honor, on the identification

   of the positive or negative pressure of the laboratory, our

   experts tell us that that is an issue that is important because

   it deals with the ingress and egress of air into the trace



                                                                           172



   analysis laboratory.  In dealing with trace analysis, you're

   talking about nanograms.  Nanograms make the difference and the

   type of procedures performed depend upon the type of pressure

   lab --

            THE COURT:  I know something about this area.  Rocky

   Flats is in this jurisdiction.  But you can provide that, can't

   you, whether you have a negative or a positive pressure lab?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, your Honor, we can try.  We don't

   believe --

            THE COURT:  Or whether it's just normal, no -- no

   device is changing the pressure in the normal air pressure.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I believe that's correct about the FBI

   laboratory.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. WYATT:  Your Honor, on paragraph 7, we've

   requested the Henthorn files to which they agree so long as it

   applies only to witnesses who will be called.  And I assume

   that they've limited it to also to FBI witnesses because the

   others, they may not have a, quote, Henthorn file on.  That

   would be my interpretation of their comments.

            The only issue there is when, when we will receive

   that, whether it will be before the 703 hearing, before the

   depositions of the individuals that have been agreed to, things

   of that nature, things that we think are relative to those

   depositions.



                                                                           173



            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, we'll provide it before

   they testify.

            THE COURT:  We will set times for a number of these

   things when we go to an in-chambers scheduling conference.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, with respect to No. 8, we

   would respectfully ask the Court to sustain that request on the

   record.  I think that with what's been filed under seal and the

   small portion that's in the public record and considering the

   allegations therein, that insofar as it relates to those items

   that are going to be testified to in this case that the defense

   would be entitled to (a) the manuals and protocols for those

   tests which will furnish the basis of the expert's opinion, the

   manuals detailing the laboratory's procedures to test an

   instrument or measures, the protocols concerning procedures --

   laboratory procedure and marshaling of evidence.

            THE COURT:  Here we want to make this distinction, and

   it came up in Ms. Wilkinson's response.  You're not talking

   about a manual for a machine, are you?

            MR. JONES:  No.

            THE COURT:  You're talking about manuals created by

   the FBI laboratory for the purposes of the conduct of the tests

   within the laboratory.

            MR. JONES:  If they're using a regularly published

   manual, they should identify it.

            THE COURT:  Okay.



                                                                           174



            MR. JONES:  But the government's response has been,

   Well, we gave you that in the notes.

            THE COURT:  That's still the response; but as I

   understand it, Ms. Wilkinson, you're going to check to make

   sure that there aren't these formula manuals or protocols, and

   they've been described.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I think written protocols is probably

   the easiest way to refer to it.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I'm concerned with the other issue as

   to general manuals that we rely on.  Each unit has a library of

   manuals -- for example, on explosives -- that the experts would

   go to look up --

            THE COURT:  Well, the things normally used by people

   in that discipline, sure.  Learned treatise manuals.

            MS. WILKINSON:  We're not being asked to disclose

   those, I take it.

            THE COURT:  Ultimately, you will, not to provide them

   manuals, just the names of them.  That's part of the rule, too:

   what's relied on by the expert witness.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Well, I believe -- well --

            THE COURT:  I'm looking at somebody's, you know,

   treatise on shockwaves or something, we ought to know what

   treatise that is.  You don't have to produce the treatise, but

   just identify it.  Presumably those persons who are then



                                                                           175



   retained by the defense can look at the same treatise.

            MR. JONES:  And we would hope that the Court would

   consider setting a time far enough in advance that we have the

   opportunity to share that with our experts and they can

   evaluate it and check it.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor -- excuse me.

            MR. JONES:  No, no, that's fine.

            MS. WILKINSON:  We're limiting it to, I take it, to

   treatise that the witness would refer to as a basis --

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Not just generally if he's familiar

   with.  For example, we have many witnesses, who have been

   experts for 20 years, and they've read everything on tire

   compression; and if he's not going to refer to that

   specifically in the testimony --

            THE COURT:  It's relied on in formulating the opinions

   which will be the subject of his testimony.

            MR. JONES:  Or in the forming -- may I ask, in

   performing the examination and report.

            THE COURT:  Well, okay.  But, you know, some of these

   things probably are going to relate to statistical manuals, I

   would presume.  So you don't need that.  I mean that's

   something that's done every day by scientists.

            MR. JONES:  No, Your Honor; but there are generally

   accepted protocols, very precise ones, for some of these tests.



                                                                           176



   And I suspect the truth of the matter is the FBI doesn't have

   them and doesn't rely on them and doesn't use them, and they

   don't want to disclose them.  Where is the -- here.  The cat

   was out of the bag on this on September the 16th, 1995.  And I

   just hand the Court, if I may, an excerpt from Dr. Whitehurst's

   deposition.

            MR. JONES:  Page 40.  Basically what we've got is a

   kind of oral tradition, like medieval English, the venerable

   Bede, instead of a regular scientific protocol manual.  And the

   advantage of the oral tradition is that nobody knows what it

   is.

            THE COURT:  I'm not going to accept this as being

   accurate or inaccurate.  I don't know.  This is somebody saying

   something.  But I think we're in agreement here that to the

   extent that a procedure is dictated by some kind -- even if it

   isn't FBI generated, but a procedure is dictated by some

   well-accepted policy or practice within the discipline, then,

   sure, that's a part of it.

            MR. JONES:  And I think we're entitled to know what

   that is before he takes the stand.

            THE COURT:  I'm in agreement with you.  I think that a

   part of that comes when we're talking about 703 as opposed to

   Rule 16.  That's what I'm -- that's the difference.

            MR. JONES:  Indeed.  And Mr. Wyatt, what about --

            MR. WYATT:  Your Honor, I believe with respect to the



                                                                           177



   calibration data, the Government has represented that it has

   produced that in the laboratory notes.  Assuming that they are

   representing that that is all of it, we have to accept that.

   But our experts have provided affidavits that they have not

   found calibration data, with the exception of very limited

   cases, and they find it very unusual.  Now, that's a question

   as to quality or integrity, that's not a question as to whether

   they have it.  But as long as they tell us that's all of it, we

   can accept that.

            THE COURT:  I think the response makes it clear that

   the calibration information is contained within the notes.

   That's your response; right?

            MS. WILKINSON:  As to these specific tests, yes.

            THE COURT:  Yes.  So I assume the notes say before I

   ran this test on this machine, I either did or didn't do the

   calibration test.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Right, and then I think the

   calibration, the problem with some of these terms is everyone

   has their understanding of what they mean.  I believe to

   calibrate the machine, that's why the expert runs a blank,

   because that way he knows what a baseline is, a couple times,

   before he runs the sample; and that's calibrating the machine.

            MR. WYATT:  And Ms. Wilkinson said as to these tests

   and I'm assuming that she's referring to the parenthetical on

   page 14 at the top.  I don't know if that's intended to be a



                                                                           178



   limitation.  Certainly the test is not.  Those are examples of

   what we would expect to find on certain machines.  There may be

   other machines which are not included within that, but we think

   that we're entitled to all of the calibration data, and I don't

   know that they intended to be a qualification in her response.

            THE COURT:  The qualification is to the tests that

   were run and that you're going to use.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Right.

            MR. WYATT:  Thank you, Your Honor.  As to paragraph

   8E, we have the same situation.  If the government is telling

   us that this is everything, that is something we have to

   accept.  But again, our experts have reviewed this -- I have

   two affidavits from them here today to present to the Court --

   and they say quality-assurance material is not contained except

   on a limited basis.  And their answer here is not quite as

   clear as it was in the previous paragraph D.  And your Honor, I

   would submit to the Court that the status report provided to

   the Court this morning, Exhibits D as in dog and E are the two

   affidavits to which I am referring.

            MR. JONES:  That hadn't yet been filed, but will be,

   Your Honor.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, quality control I think is

   different.  Depends on how you define it.  I believe

   calibrating the machine and testing it for the base line to

   make sure that there is not residue contained within the



                                                                           179



   machine before you run the actual sample is quality control.

            So I'm not sure how this information differs.  As to

   avoiding contamination, I think that's the way that these, if

   we're talking about these machines again, in terms of the

   explosive residue, where you have the biggest danger of

   contamination, that's how the machines are tested for quality

   control.  Each and every time you do a test.

            THE COURT:  Whatever they did, they did, and it's in

   the notes.  That's what we're dwelling on.  And if there's

   disagreement about whether that's good enough, we'll hear that

   at trial.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Correct.  Or if the expert didn't

   document it but did it, he can explain it for himself why it's

   in the notes.  We're saying everything that's documented, we

   have disclosed.

            MR. JONES:  That's the issue.  She just said it.  So

   much of what they do, they don't write down so they can

   surprise the defense counsel at the trial.  That's what we

   want, what they did, not what they wrote down, what they did.

   She said it; that's precisely the issue.

            THE COURT:  I don't know how you're going to do that

   other than interview them or take the testimony of them or

   something.  But I would think that any reasonable juror would

   look somewhat askance at a scientist who doesn't document what

   he did.  Certainly judges do.



                                                                           180



            MR. WYATT:  Certainly, your Honor.  We accept that.

   The only other issue I would raise as to that is we're not just

   talking about calibration, your Honor, we're talking about

   protective clothing, gloves, hoods, mitts, things of that

   nature.

            THE COURT:  I understand.  I understand.  You're

   entitled to what they documented.  If we're going to get into

   they did something and didn't document it, I'm sure that will

   be the subject of cross-examination and argument.

            MR. WYATT:  On paragraph 8F, Your Honor, as to contact

   between bulk explosives and the laboratory personnel in the

   trace analysis lab, it appears that they have resolved that by

   their response saying it has been produced to the extent it

   exists.

            Paragraph 8G is the results of quality-assurance work

   and the raw data on which those are based and that would be the

   various blanks that have already been referenced and I believe

   that that would be answered by her, Ms. Wilkinson's response

   today in court as well as the response in the papers.

            Paragraph 8H I believe was addressed by the Court in

   the comments concerning the handling of the evidence at crime

   scene and in its other interim places between there and the

   lab.

            The same is true as to paragraph 8I on how the samples

   were packaged.  Ms. Wilkinson referenced that certain packages



                                                                           181



   were maintained in sealed plastic containers or bags, I believe

   she said.  And, your Honor, to that extent I do have one

   modification that we would request of them, and perhaps we

   should address this informally.  But that is as to the type of

   plastic bag.

            There are certain types of plastic bags which are

   impermeable to explosive residues; there are others, the

   typical polythene bags which are not.  And I don't know what

   the FBI uses, and it may depend on what was available at the

   crime scene.  I don't know, particularly in this case where

   there was so much debris, but that's an issue that will be an

   issue for the Court at some point.  Or for the jury.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, we can resolve that right

   now.  As to the crime scene, there's only one piece of evidence

   referred to as Q 507 in the lab and in the master Q and K list

   that has explosive residue and it's not really a explosive

   residue, it's ammonium nitrate crystals on it.  One piece.

   It's contained in a plastic bag, and when the defense saw it,

   it was still in that same plastic bag with the original

   packaging.  When they come to observe it and view it again,

   they can look at that plastic bag.  But out of all the crime

   scene evidence at the actual bombing of the building, there's

   only one piece of evidence.

            THE COURT:  Do you know what kind of plastic the bag

   is?



                                                                           182



            MS. WILKINSON:  Looks to me like a heavy Zip Lock bag,

   your Honor; I'm not a plastic experts.

            MR. WYATT:  That would be my response as well.  We're

   not plastics experts when we come in to look at this.  But the

   laboratory should have a protocol -- the experts obviously are

   aware that that's an issue and they should be able to identify

   it, either ours or theirs.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, there's not high-explosive

   residue on it, so whether or not high-explosive residue could

   penetrate the plastic, I'm telling you is irrelevant, it's

   ammonium nitrate crystals that are on that piece.  Otherwise,

   there is no explosive residue found.

            MR. WYATT:  Well, can I just speak to that issue, your

   Honor --

            THE COURT:  Well, she just did and that's the

   Government's position.

            MR. WYATT:  With respect to paragraph 8J, I believe

   that's addressed in two places in a similar or maybe slightly

   different fashion as to how the samples were stored, and that

   goes to part of the continuity or chain of custody, but it also

   applies to any contact with bulk explosives or in regard to

   other types of samples --

            THE COURT:  Well, you can make that request more

   specific because your concern is only with respect to

   particular types of items.



                                                                           183



            MR. WYATT:  Right, and now that those 10,000 sheets

   were provided to us, which was at the last hearing, we should

   be able to narrow that response more; we just haven't had an

   opportunity in this short time.

            THE COURT:  That should be narrowed down to where it

   makes a difference; otherwise it's burdensome.

            MR. WYATT:  K and L, the transportation procedures and

   the chain of custody, the Court has already addressed.

            Paragraph 9 --

            THE COURT:  We'll take a recess before paragraph 9.

            MR. WYATT:  Yes, Your Honor.

            THE COURT:  20 minutes.

       (Recess at 3:14 p.m.)

       (Reconvened at 3:30 p.m.)

            THE COURT:  Be seated, please.

            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, Mr. Nichols is not present

   yet.

            THE COURT:  We'll wait for him.

       (Defendant Nichols present.)

            THE COURT:  We didn't do anything without you,

   Mr. Nichols.  We waited for you.

            So we're prepared to proceed now with No. 9.

            MR. WYATT:  Yes, your Honor.  With respect to No. 9,

   that is dealing with the procedures of handling bulk explosives

   and standards.  We would suggest to the Court that there are



                                                                           184



   policies and procedures or protocols or methodologies, whatever

   you want to call them, that would be relevant to this issue.

   The Government has also acknowledged another issue that we are

   addressing, which is the possible contamination of any exhibits

   through contact with explosives.  They've reported that there

   has been at least one incident where that has occurred and that

   we have received those documents.

            With respect to the maps or diagrams, however, your

   Honor, or floor plan, I recognize their position stated in the

   last sentence that this information can fall into the wrong

   hands.  We are not requesting that they provide necessarily a

   floor plan of where each unit is.  We would like to know in

   proximity where one unit is as opposed to the other as it

   applies to bulk explosives and trace explosives analysis units

   only.  If they could provide us just with that information so

   that we would have some information, be it on different floors,

   whether they're on different sides of the building --

            THE COURT:  Well, what do you -- maybe this requires

   some definition of what do you mean by "bulk explosives."

            MS. WILKINSON:  Judge, I might be able to help with

   that.

            Bulk explosives, I believe, is anything other than the

   trace evidence that we talk about, normally find in a case.

            Bulk explosives are not stored in FBI headquarters

   where the laboratory is.  Bulk explosives have to be stored in



                                                                           185



   a separate magazine, so there aren't bulk explosives unless a

   device were brought in that was seized in a case.

            THE COURT:  Yes.  Two tests are being done for two

   different cases at the same time in the same area.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Right.  For example, the Unabomber

   case could be being addressed at the same time as another case

   in the laboratory.

            But there aren't bulk explosives, is my understanding,

   stored in the laboratory.

            Now, in the storage areas below, where some of the

   evidence was stored, we have said that we found about a month,

   I think, or two after the explosion -- we found some residue in

   this one area.  And we have identified or we're in the process

   of identifying what evidence was there, but none of the

   evidence there tested positive for residue -- or we're not

   introducing any of that evidence for residue.

            So it's really irrelevant in terms of locating where

   that storage area is; but we have told the defense and we will

   continue to provide information as we determine what pieces of

   evidence were actually in that storage area at what time that

   they were there and that we found some residue.  But it really

   is irrelevant because that evidence is not being introduced for

   purposes of explosive residue.

            Am I making myself clear?

            THE COURT:  Not to me, but maybe you did to him.



                                                                           186



            MS. WILKINSON:  In other words, there are pieces of

   the truck that were recovered.  None of those pieces had

   explosive residue; so yes, we're going to introduce those

   pieces but not for purposes of residue.  So whether there was

   contamination or residue found in that area is irrelevant.

            But what we want to do to assure the defense is show

   them what pieces were stored in that area, and we're working on

   that.

            MR. WYATT:  To the extent they are not introducing any

   of that, that is appropriate; but we believe that the

   documentation will be present with respect to any items that

   have tested positive.  If there has been any contamination from

   bulk explosives and if their procedures call for storing them

   in a separate magazine, then that should take care of it.  But

   the example she gave concerning the Unabomber -- and although I

   don't know that that necessarily involves both bulk

   explosives -- I don't have any knowledge of that -- the example

   is an example of exactly what we're looking for.  If they're

   bringing in bulk explosives or items that have been exposed to

   bulk explosives here, we're dealing with nanograms again; and

   if those protocols are not followed, we have to know that.  And

   that's what we're simply asking for.

            THE COURT:  Isn't it logical to work backwards from

   whatever they're going to rely on with residue?

            MR. WYATT:  I would agree with that.



                                                                           187



            MS. WILKINSON:  We'll provide that, your Honor.  The

   six items -- for example, Mr. McVeigh's clothes and this piece

   of the truck, the one piece, the small piece that had the

   ammonium nitrate, we'll provide the full chain of custody on

   that.  And none of those pieces went to that storage area.  But

   we'll show where it went in the laboratory, and then they can

   make their arguments about whether they think it was

   contaminated.

            THE COURT:  I think that does it.  Work back from the

   items that are actually going to be used for purposes of the

   testimony or indications of residue being on those items.

            MR. WYATT:  That addresses half of the issue, your

   Honor.  The other issue is as to the floor plan, so to speak --

            THE COURT:  Well, all you need, then, is in what

   proximity were these to any other explosives, as you've

   described them, as bulk explosives.

            MR. WYATT:  And as to solid walls, openings and things

   of that nature.

            With respect to the next three issues, Items 10, 11

   and 12, Mr. Jones will address them.

            MR. JONES:  If I may, I'll address them together in

   order to expedite it and move it along.

            If the Court will give me just a moment here.

            Your Honor, from the materials that the Government has

   furnished to us plus published accounts in the press, it



                                                                           188



   appears that the General Accounting Office, which is as the

   Court knows a branch of the legislative branch of government --

   division of the legislative branch and that they perform

   certain surveys and investigations at the request of Congress,

   conducted an investigation of the FBI laboratory within the

   past, recent past, a report which is completed and may have in

   fact been completed before the bombing in this case.

            In addition to that, the Office of the Inspector

   General has been conducting an investigation, and it's my

   understanding the reports will shortly be available on that to

   the Government.

            And then there are also certain audits and reviews and

   compliance studies both of the Office of Inspector General and

   the General Accounting Office with respect to the FBI lab.

            We have raised the issue before.  And to some extent

   this also comes under the nature of exculpatory evidence, but

   we put it in this because it directly impacts upon the

   methodology.

            We believe that the Court should order that the

   Government furnish us the Inspector General's report, the full

   report when it's released with an appropriate protective order,

   any GAO studies of the lab, the last three years before

   April 19, 1995, and the period since then and any other audits

   or reviews of the lab that discuss the issues as it relates to

   the personnel involved in this case concerning qualifications,



                                                                           189



   disciplinary matters, which presumably would be under Henthorn,

   contamination, methodology and review.

            Now, what the Government has done is furnish us thus

   far copies of certain material only as it relates to the

   Oklahoma City bombing case; but the other material, which up to

   this point we've not pressed for because the Court had other

   things on the front burner, but now we're getting down to the

   point where we must analyze very important forensic evidence.

   And to us, it is exculpatory in the first place and secondly

   necessary to evaluate the thoroughness of these examinations

   and the reports that will given from the witness stand and

   where there are allegations and findings or allegations or

   findings concerning inadequacies in the laboratory in the areas

   that are relevant to this case.  And I mean, I'm sure there is

   an element that are not.  For example, there is a photography

   unit.  And I don't know that there is any photography in this

   case that's in dispute; but handwriting, hairs and fibers,

   fingerprints, bomb residue -- all of that directly relates to

   this case and is critical for it.

            It doesn't make any difference whether it's just one

   report for one hair or one fiber.  That could be the crucial

   matter in this case either for the Government or the defense.

            And I'll give the Court an example:  If's my

   understanding that a major national periodical will report that

   one of the FBI laboratory personnel who will testify in this



                                                                           190



   case, according to what we have been given, will be criticized

   in the report for work he did in another major bombing case, to

   wit:  The World Trade Center case.  To me, it is relevant even

   though under their standards we wouldn't get that because that

   doesn't relate to Oklahoma City; but if this same scientist/

   examiner, whatever his qualifications may be, was criticized

   for similar work involving a similar bomb within two years of

   this case, I think we are entitled to review that to determine

   whether we can use it on cross-examination.

            And I ask the Court with whatever appropriate

   protective order that the Government submit those studies of

   the General Accounting Office, the audits and reviews of the

   lab, and the full Inspector General's report as well as the

   rest of the material that was redacted to us.

            Alternatively -- and I know the Court is loath to do

   this and for good reason -- I think at a minimum, it should be

   submitted to the Court for in camera inspection, because there

   has been a close holding of this material to the bosom; and

   while Ms. Wilkinson has said to the Court that we received this

   material, the history of this has not been reassuring.  No one

   ever mentioned a word to us during all of these meetings and

   exculpatory evidence about Frederic Whitehurst and that there

   would be these problems until ABC reported when a transcript

   became released or was released to the public in the World

   Trade Center case.



                                                                           191



            And even after we wrote them and pointed out to them

   that we had received over the transom internal documents from

   the Department of Justice that a special section had been set

   up to review the impact of these allegations on various cases,

   we still didn't get it.  And finally, after the Court indicated

   its impatience that we hadn't received it, we began to get it.

            So we went almost seven and a half months while they

   knew there was this ticking time bomb in the laboratory of

   these very serious allegations in the very units that are

   crucial to this case involving the very people who worked in

   this case.  And my concern is we want to know what else they

   were criticized for when they did similar work in other cases,

   because if we don't have that, we cannot evaluate completely

   their work in this case.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, we disagree that

   information about agents' conduct in other cases, where there

   are just allegations that aren't relevant to this case, should

   be disclosed; and we have disclosed all of the relevant

   allegations about examiners in this case, whether or not

   they're going to eventually testify.  But the ones that we

   currently believe will testify, we have turned over all those

   allegations made by Dr. Whitehurst and the memoranda of

   interview by the Inspector General of other people involved

   with the investigation.

            In a case in Delaware called United States vs. 



                                                                           192



   Gonzales, this information was turned over post-trial relating

   to their case and an agent who had testified in that case.  And

   the judge in his opinion ruled that it was not a Brady

   violation or that the information would not have changed the

   verdict in this case and went through a long discussion about

   whether this information would be admissible or not and ruled

   that most of it would not have been admissible because it was

   this person's reputation and his actions in other cases or

   general reputation evidence.

            So relying in part on that and on our understanding of

   our Brady obligations, we have disclosed only those allegations

   relevant to this case.  We do that for that reason but also

   because these allegations in other cases are being decided by

   prosecutors in those cases and judges in those case, and we

   feel like we have a responsibility to just give this defense

   counsel those allegations that are relevant.

            On the other hand, the IG's report will discuss all of

   the allegations, is our understanding.  And unless there is

   some reason that the IG does not want us to disclose it under a

   protective order, which I can't imagine there would be, we will

   give the entire report to defense counsel, which will contain a

   discussion of all the allegations.

            THE COURT:  When will it be ready?

            MS. WILKINSON:  As we have --

            THE COURT:  You said it would be ready in September.



                                                                           193



            MS. WILKINSON:  As we have told your Honor, the

   Inspector is an independent entity; and the latest we have been

   informed was that it would be ready by the end of the year.

   But again, that's why we've been providing all the underlying

   information to the defense counsel, because we have -- we

   cannot assure the Court of a date certain when the report will

   be issued.

            THE COURT:  What does this GAO report deal with?

            MS. WILKINSON:  I'm unaware of that.  That doesn't

   mean it doesn't exist, your Honor.  The GAO is obviously an arm

   of the Congress.  They may or may not have done an inspection

   of the FBI laboratory.  If Mr. Jones has more information, I

   would appreciate receiving it, the specifics of it.  We can try

   and track it down if the FBI has a copy.  Obviously, we can't

   force the Congress to give it to us; but I would imagine if

   it's a GAO report, unless there is some specific reason, it's

   probably a public document.

            THE COURT:  Those are public, normally.

            MR. JONES:  It's my understanding this one is not

   published.  And they're not hearing about the GAO for the first

   time today.  They heard about the GAO last year.  This has been

   a year that I've told them this exists; and I can't find it

   available to me.  And under 803(a) -- I'm sorry -- 803(8), I

   believe we are entitled to these reports; and they are

   admissible, if they're relevant.  That's, of course, something



                                                                           194



   that the Court would have to determine; but if they're willing

   to give us the entire Inspector General's report, I can't

   imagine why we couldn't get the entire GAO report.  And

   while --

            THE COURT:  It may be totally irrelevant.  I mean, the

   GAO looks into things like, you know, record-keeping

   independently of quality control but record-keeping to comply

   with some Congressional directives, possible employment

   discrimination matters, things like that are of interest to the

   Congress in their oversight function.

            MR. JONES:  Right.  And I'm not interested in those.

            THE COURT:  No.  I wouldn't think so.

            MR. JONES:  The GAO report that I'm referring to is

   based upon a newspaper story which may or may not be accurate,

   which deals with the precise problems of the liability and

   integrity of the FBI, has nothing to do with discrimination or

   whether the budget is being exceeded or anything like that.  It

   was a review of the laboratory.  And I can't believe the FBI

   doesn't have a copy of it.

            And as I say, it's not something I requested day

   before yesterday.

            THE COURT:  Well --

            MR. JONES:  With respect to the other matters, I would

   be willing to withhold in abeyance the request for all of the

   testimony on all of the issues, which while there are



                                                                           195



   allegations, I don't think that's quite accurate.

   Dr. Whitehurst made allegations.  The other people gave

   statements under oath about their knowledge.  And the only

   thing we have received is the testimony of those people under

   oath as it relates to the Oklahoma City bombing case.

            I'll accept her representation that we're going to get

   the entire GAO report; but if we don't get it by, say,

   December 31, then I would earnestly ask the Court if we're not

   going to get the report to at least get all the statements that

   were given to the GAO, which is going to be the basis of the

   report anyway.

            I mean, I don't see how the case can go forward with

   the FBI laboratory under serious question, whether those

   questions are resolved one way or the other, without our either

   getting the results of the investigation or the statements and

   evidence that that panel heard, particularly since it relates

   to the bombing explosives trace unit.

            THE COURT:  Or here --

            MS. WILKINSON:  Judge, many don't.  For example, there

   is individuals involved in other cases that are unrelated to

   this case --

            THE COURT:  Well, if -- you know, I don't want to use

   an agent's name here because I don't want to be unfair to

   anybody; but if Agent X did procedures in this case and formed

   either data that were relied upon by the experts or himself is



                                                                           196



   going to be a witness, if he did the same kind of thing in

   another case and it was criticized, then I think that's

   pertinent, you see, because that goes to the quality of his

   work and his competence.  And I don't have -- this is another

   one of those where I don't have the advantage of some kind of

   harmless error analysis.  We're talking about admissibility of

   this evidence at trial.

            Now --

            MS. WILKINSON:  Right, and we would argue --

            THE COURT:  -- waiting for this Inspector General's

   report is holding us up, if we're going to have to wait for it;

   and I don't want to do that.

            MS. WILKINSON:  But we do -- we have provided the

   allegations, your Honor.  If you're talking about allegations

   of a -- of someone who participated in this case and what they

   did in another case, if it's similar, I understand you to

   say --

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MS. WILKINSON:  -- then that should be disclosed.

            THE COURT:  Right.  If this person performed this same

   kind of test and did so inadequately or incompetently in

   another case, then that, I think, is pertinent.

            MS. WILKINSON:  We understand that, your Honor.

            MR. JONES:  And the loophole in that is "this same

   kind of test."  No two tests are alike.  What we ask you to do



                                                                           197



   and our specific relief is if Agent X performed a trace

   analysis of bomb material in this case and he did the same

   thing in the World Trade Center case and was criticized for it,

   we're entitled to that.  Now, he may not have done the precise

   same test, but he may --

            THE COURT:  Well, a trace analysis.

            MR. JONES:  A trace analysis.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.  I'm talking about the type of --

   the test for a given purpose, if the purpose is identical.

            Now, I have to be careful about making qualitative

   judgments about work done in other cases.  Obviously, there are

   judges dealing with those issues in those cases.

            But at the same time, the determination made by a

   judge in another case is not binding upon me.

            MR. JONES:  And I don't know that there has

   necessarily been a determination in others.

            THE COURT:  I don't know one way or another.

            MR. JONES:  My concern is if we can't get the

   Inspector General's report within a reasonable period of time,

   then we should have access to those sworn statements; not just

   for this case but the other cases.

            Now, if they want to redact the name of the defendant

   or the name of the case, I don't have a problem with that.  If

   we need it, we can come back to it.

            THE COURT:  Regrettably, I think that ultimately when



                                                                           198



   it comes to the issue, I probably have to look to see myself

   whether I believe that it's sufficiently related.  I don't want

   to do that.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I understand.

            THE COURT:  But I think it's going to be necessary.

            MS. WILKINSON:  We would suggest, though, your Honor,

   there is a difference between whether he did the test

   improperly, Agent X, and just a mere allegation by someone --

            THE COURT:  Of course.

            MS. WILKINSON:  -- who doesn't have personal

   knowledge.  And the problem with that is a lot of these

   allegations by Agent Whitehurst -- he was not involved with the

   testing, so he says I think so-and-so might not have been

   careful doing this test.  That, I don't believe is sufficient

   in another case to disclose.

            Now, if there is -- what Mr. Jones is talking about is

   other people who gave testimony who said yes, I saw him do that

   test and it was not sufficient, that's different.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.  It couldn't -- it can't be just

   rumor or speculation or rank hearsay.  It's got to be based on

   something that would be admissible evidence.

            MR. JONES:  Or lead to admissible evidence.  I believe

   it is exculpatory; but in Whitehurst, that's a good example.

   Dr. Whitehurst gives his theory, opinions, and then says who

   else may have direct knowledge.  And they go to those other



                                                                           199



   people and take statements from them, and many of those other

   people -- I think I counted nine -- corroborated various stages

   what Dr. Whitehurst said.

            So it's not just an allegation.

            Now, it may be those other people are wrong, but it is

   testimony which some trier of fact somewhere down the line,

   whether the Inspector General, has to resolve.

            THE COURT:  Well, I'm not worrying about the Inspector

   General.  I'm worrying about having to resolve this here.  I'm

   not worrying about it, either; I'm looking at it.  And what we

   have to resolve here before we hear this testimony in trial and

   whatever is the mechanism by which we get to that point, we

   need to get working on it.

            Now, you know, I'm not saying this critically of the

   prosecution team here because the Inspector General is

   separate.  That's why that exists.  But the timing there is not

   good at all.

            MR. HARTZLER:  Could I have a moment?

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, Mr. Hartzler reminds me of

   a good point, which is the allegations by Dr. Whitehurst

   against certain individuals that are involved with our case,

   while lengthy, are repetitive.  He makes the same general

   allegations about people's lack of qualifications, you know,

   their lack of complete testing.  And he makes those same



                                                                           200



   allegations with regard to Oklahoma City, World Trade Center,

   the Moody case; so the allegations we've disclosed, although

   they are specific to Ok. Bomb, are the same types of

   allegations that he makes about these people.  And when he

   makes general allegations about those people, we have disclosed

   them to the defense so they have an idea of the world of

   allegations against these people.

            So what we're withholding are the specifics, this

   specific test, which from my memory -- and we'll go back and

   review this -- are not the same kind of tests that were done by

   most of the examiners.

            THE COURT:  The point here is not the allegations.

   The point is what are the facts and whether there is support

   for these allegations.  Now, that's what we have to get to.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Obviously, it's our position that it

   depends on the allegation.  And the ones where there have been

   testimony by other individuals or statements given -- those

   have been provided to the defense.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, that's simply not true.

            Let's go back to Mr. Hartzler's comment, again, this

   definition of exculpatory:  Well, as long as we kind of tell

   you generally that he makes the same general allegations, we've

   satisfied our burden.

            I'm not interested in the general allegations.  I'm

   interested in the specifics; and they've given us enough



                                                                           201



   stuff -- and I'm going to be careful now and I hope not to

   repeat their sin of discussing what's under seal, but it's not

   true.  These people have testified under oath corroborating

   Dr. Whitehurst and his allegations in this case on a number of

   these incidents, and I suspect that they do the exact same

   thing in the other cases.  The Court has before it the letter

   that was written to Dr. Whitehurst by the judge in the World

   Trade Center case concerning his credibility and his honor.

   And --

            THE COURT:  Well --

            MR. JONES:  I have to start with the allegations in

   order to get to the specifics.  They tell me these are the

   allegations.  They know that I can't cross-examine on the

   allegations.  But surely, it is material if Agent X takes the

   stand and says, I performed a test here on chemical residue Y

   on defendant 1 and found such and such, to then say, Well, now,

   sir, in a previous case, using a similar technique, did you not

   opine such an opinion and did it not develop such and such that

   your analysis was incorrect or wrong or incomplete?

            We're not dealing with allegations.  And the more the

   Government tries to keep us from getting it -- I know that

   there was a thermonuclear device in the FBI laboratory they

   were testing; and they are desperate to keep us from getting it

   because it undercuts the Government's entire forensic evidence.

   And that's what we want to see.



                                                                           202



            THE COURT:  You know, several things:  With respect to

   the letter, I recall reading that; and, of course, that's an

   opinion, given allegations of what that author of that letter

   knew at the time.

            MR. JONES:  And only by a federal judge, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  I'm withholding any comment.

            Now, you know, when the allegations are followed up

   with statements from persons with direct knowledge -- by that I

   mean using their sensory perception direct knowledge -- that's

   different from the allegations.  And that's what we need to

   find out:  What is there?

            MS. WILKINSON:  That's what we've been providing.

            THE COURT:  And are you providing it from what the

   Inspector General's team got?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.  What they do, your Honor, is

   they do a memorandum of interview, which is our 302.  They put

   the witness' name at the top, where the person is from, and

   they put their, you know, summary of the person's statement in

   most cases.

            THE COURT:  Sort of like a 302.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.  And in some cases, the person is

   asked about five different cases:  Specifically do you know

   about this -- you know, relevant to UNABOM or Ok. Bomb.  And

   when we -- when the information is relevant to the Oklahoma

   City bombing or to the individual's general credibility, those



                                                                           203



   are disclosed.

            Then there is also a transcript for some of the

   witnesses who have more detailed testimony.

            THE COURT:  Taken like a deposition.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Like Dr. Whitehurst; but other

   individuals, there is actually transcripts.

            MR. JONES:  I'm sorry.  I dispute that.  That's not

   what's disclosed.  Some of these witnesses' statements are six

   pages, and there is one paragraph for these six pages; so you

   wonder what they talked about on the other six pages.

            THE COURT:  I think the redaction has been identified,

   then.  It deals with other cases.

            MR. JONES:  But it's those things that they did in

   those other cases that I'm interested in.

            THE COURT:  I know.  I'm trying to get a workable

   approach to this without, perhaps, having to wait for the

   conclusions and the recommendations part of the Inspector

   General's report, because I presume that that's part of, you

   know -- if their investigation is completed and now they're

   working on conclusions and recommendations, we don't need them.

   What we need is what was developed with respect to these

   allegations.  And I guess what we also need is an evaluation of

   your redactions to see if they're appropriately done.

            MR. JONES:  I would make this offer:  If they will

   take me to a room, I'll come in without a tape-recorder, no



                                                                           204



   pencil, no paper and I'll read them and tell them which ones I

   want and which ones I don't.  And those that I don't are

   resolved; and those that I do, we can discuss it and if we can

   agree, fine.

            THE COURT:  I don't see agreement on this side.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I don't believe that would be

   appropriate.  I think if the Court would like us to first go

   back and review them again, I think that would be appropriate,

   see if we can make any further disclosures.

            We have to coordinate this, as you might imagine, with

   other prosecutors who are handling these same issues in front

   of other judges who are just as interested in this information.

            THE COURT:  That's right.

            MS. WILKINSON:  And we can first try and make further

   disclosures and then, second, if the Court would like,

   submitted in camera for further review.

            THE COURT:  I think that may be necessary ultimately.

            MS. WILKINSON:  But we will start by going back and

   trying to make further disclosures.

            THE COURT:  Yes.  The first thing is for you to review

   to see what more can be revealed, given, hopefully, it's been

   helpful to talk about what I think are the guiding principles

   here.

            MS. WILKINSON:  There are, your Honor.  For example,

   I'm aware of some transcripts of individuals who comment about



                                                                           205



   a variety of cases.  If we can go back and persuade other

   people that that disclosure will be under the protective order

   and even though it talks about other cases, because it's a

   transcribed statement, you know, we want to give it to the

   defense even though we think most of it doesn't belong, we'll

   try and do that.

            THE COURT:  Well, and it's also possible, I suppose,

   to give the information regarding the tests without disclosing

   the particular case.  That's possible.

            MS. WILKINSON:  That's possible, your Honor.  There is

   very little of that type of specific information, just so the

   Court understands:  A particular test was conducted, and it

   wasn't conducted appropriately.  It's more this person

   testified this way, it was beyond his area of expertise or

   that, you know -- that the data does not back up his testimony.

            THE COURT:  Well, that kind of thing is within the

   control of the Court in which that took place.

            I think that the -- it's not a question of what the

   testimony was in a case, it's -- as such.  It's the question of

   what the testimony was based on, the scientific methodology and

   the approach to the testing and the things that led to the

   opinion testimony.

            Now, you know, if somebody is not only incompetent

   because he or she is performing tests for which there is no

   qualification, that's an issue.



                                                                           206



            If the person, just to take an extreme example -- and

   I hope it isn't true, but if a person shows up drunk and does

   these tests, we need to know that, if that's a routine pattern.

   That's the kind of thing.

            So you do a further evaluation of it and we'll come

   back to it, today, tomorrow, or Friday.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Okay.

            MR. WYATT:  Your Honor, if you please, with respect to

   paragraph 13, the issues have been addressed by Mr. Jones and

   Ms. Wilkinson to a certain extent and will be able to be better

   addressed at the deposition of Dr. Whitehurst which has been

   agreed; and we would ask the Court hold that in abeyance.

            THE COURT:  Is there a date set for that?

            MR. WYATT:  I don't believe so, your Honor.  We are

   still negotiating on that and the terms of the deposition, if

   I'm not mistaken.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I'm sorry, your Honor.  I didn't hear

   which one he's holding in abeyance.

            MR. WYATT:  13.

            THE COURT:  13.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Thank you.

            MR. WYATT:  Which is what's set forth in the papers we

   filed.

            Paragraph 14, your Honor, we're requesting information

   concerning evidence which may be offered by the Government at



                                                                           207



   the trial concerning tests of physical, forensic or mental

   examinations on persons; for instance, the defendants.  An

   example to the Court would be fingernail scrapings, hair

   samples, things of that nature which have been taken from our

   client and presumably other people who may be witnesses in this

   case or whose evidence upon which may be presented to the

   Court; and we would ask that those be produced.

            I believe the Government's response is that they have

   provided us with everything to date that has been tested.  I

   believe that's how I would read their response.

            THE COURT:  Well, is that a correct reading?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.  We've provided everything we

   have to date, your Honor.  We have some ongoing forensics

   examinations; and when they're -- when we receive the results,

   we'll provide them to the defense.

            THE COURT:  Why are they still ongoing?

            MS. WILKINSON:  For a variety of reasons.  For

   example, as the attorneys have reviewed the evidence, we've

   asked for additional tests, we've talked to other experts to

   ask for additional tests; that have suggested to us additional

   tests.

            One of our witnesses had a stroke, and so all of the

   handwriting had to be redone.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MS. WILKINSON:  There is not a large volume, but I



                                                                           208



   just want the Court to know there are a few outstanding tests.

            MR. WYATT:  Again, your Honor, our qualification on

   all of these requests is that we have received most of the

   documentation on 18 but not on all 31 or 32 of these experts.

            As to paragraph 15(a), your Honor, I believe that the

   Government is in substantial compliance as of its October 31

   production on those except as to any of the disputes that we

   still have with regard to any errors in the identifications or

   descriptions or sources, but those are issues that were

   addressed by the Court at the morning session.

            Paragraph 15(b), I believe, is satisfied to the extent

   of the 18 but not as to 31 experts.  And we accept the

   Government's representation there and are awaiting the rest,

   and that could be held in abeyance.

            Paragraph (c), we would limit those, your Honor, only

   to those items which they anticipate producing.  And the

   purpose of this particular request is that the laboratory

   reports themselves -- and we've appended -- I believe it's

   Exhibit J to docket entry 1966, a laboratory report -- I think

   it's 85.  That serial number identifies where several

   techniques are identified, but you don't know which one reached

   the conclusion reached.  And our experts tell us that the

   different types of tests used generally would not reach the

   same types of conclusions; so we need to know if negative test

   results came up using one test, positive test results on



                                                                           209



   another, so that we can determine whether those were

   appropriate types of tests and to know whether there is

   inconsistent reporting.

            THE COURT:  Well, are you talking about limiting this

   to where there is at least one positive?  And by "positive," I

   mean productive in the sense that it relates to something that

   may be evidence.

            MR. WYATT:  I believe that that's fair, your Honor,

   because --

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MR. WYATT:  And as to the material that they

   anticipate --

            THE COURT:  So if you ran the test three times and it

   came out negative twice and positive once, you want to know the

   two negatives.

            MR. WYATT:  That's correct, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  And whether there was any change in the

   testing that made the difference.

            MR. WYATT:  That is correct, your Honor.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, can I clarify?  Is this a

   high explosive residue test?

            MR. WYATT:  Your Honor, that would be related to any

   tests conducted of a forensic nature.  I believe that that's

   appropriate --

            THE COURT:  That's going to be used.



                                                                           210



            MR. WYATT:  Right, that's going to be used in court as

   evidence against our client.

            MS. WILKINSON:  All results of all tests, your Honor,

   have been disclosed.  And I go back again to Agent Burmeister.

   He does not report a finding as consistent or inconsistent or

   identified with, unless he has done confirmatory tests.  And

   that's where why he runs a variety of tests and sometimes come

   up -- they look for different things, but when he sees all of

   them positive, he will say, for example, this is an ammonium

   nitrate crystal.

            THE COURT:  But if he has -- usually, these tests are

   done with a presumption of what you're going to find.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I don't think that's true in the case

   for the explosive residue, your Honor.  They extract a sample.

   They don't know whether there is --

            THE COURT:  All right.  Unknown.  And you do a

   qualitative analysis and a quantitative analysis.  If you have

   inconsistent results, are those in the notes?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, they are.

            THE COURT:  And if there is a change in the

   methodology that relates to the difference in the results, is

   that in the notes?

            MS. WILKINSON:  I believe if the agent -- if the

   examiner -- I guess you're saying if they altered the --

            THE COURT:  Yeah.  You run something and it comes out,



                                                                           211



   you know, and then you say, Well, I'm going to try this, and

   you make a modification in the testing procedure and you get a

   different result.  Now, I think that has to be documented.

            MS. WILKINSON:  If it's documented, your Honor, I

   believe it's in the notes.  We're talking in generalities.

   It's my understanding from reviewing Agent Burmeister's notes

   that every single test he did and how he conducted it is in his

   notes.  So if he did any changes on --

            THE COURT:  That ought to be in there.

            MS. WILKINSON:  It ought to be in there, yes, sir.

            THE COURT:  You might confirm with him that that was

   his practice.

            MS. WILKINSON:  All right.

            MR. WYATT:  And, your Honor, the exhibit I gave you --

   I should correct the record -- is Exhibit I to docket entry

   1966; and that is page 4 of lab report serial No. 105, which

   identifies six different techniques used on one particular

   specimen.  But we can't tell which ones, from reading the

   reports, actually proved positive.

            THE COURT:  Well, why don't you make a specific

   written request on that so that it's understandable.

            MR. WYATT:  Your Honor -- we can do that, your Honor,

   but it's applicable almost across the board to the 400 reports.

   It wouldn't be to fingerprints --

            THE COURT:  We're not --



                                                                           212



            MR. WYATT:  -- but it would be to others.

            THE COURT:  Yeah, and they're not using 400 test

   results.

            MR. WYATT:  Correct.

            THE COURT:  So what I'm telling you is it seems to me

   that if you have something that you can't understand from the

   notes that relates to an item that's going to be used in

   evidence and will be testified about, ask a specific question.

            MR. WYATT:  Certainly, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. WYATT:  Paragraph 16 and 17, I believe, can be

   addressed together; and I believe that the Government's

   responses have resolved those issues because they have reported

   that they are giving us all of the laboratory notes and their

   results.

            So that would resolve those.

            Paragraph 18, if I may have just a moment, your Honor,

   is a general catchall; and the same responses apply.  It

   appears that they're giving us all of the information;

   therefore, that issue would be resolved by their response.

            Paragraph 19 is the same, your Honor.

            Paragraph 20 appears to be the same, your Honor.

            Paragraph 21 is one which we do dispute, your Honor;

   and we dispute it to this extent:  There may be some semantics

   difference between their interpretation of a Farfield study and



                                                                           213



   ours, but a Farfield study involves glass breakage at a certain

   distance from ground zero and the distribution of debris over

   one pound in the general area and where they find it.

            The Government has said they produced -- or excuse

   me -- they've not conducted these types of tests; however, in

   the last month we have received a report from one of their

   experts, an L.J.; and in that report, which is attached to

   the -- as one of the items in the cumulative Exhibit G of the

   status report, they specifically reference -- if I may check

   that, your Honor.  That particular expert --

            THE COURT:  Well, let me just ask this question of the

   Government, because maybe this is not a problem.

            The way I read this response is that somebody did,

   indeed, record where debris was found and the distances and so

   forth; right?  You've got some kind of a grid --

            MS. WILKINSON:  Generally, yes.

            THE COURT:  -- about that.  And then the word "study"

   here suggests a test, as opposed to simply a historical

   recording.

            Now, you've provided the historical recording, that

   grid or graph or whatever?

            MS. WILKINSON:  I'm not sure, your Honor, whether we

   have provided the grid that I've seen that shows window

   breakage.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.



                                                                           214



            MS. WILKINSON:  But we will disclose that.  I'll go

   back and check.

            THE COURT:  And location of debris and all of that

   with distances.  I would assume that's part of the

   investigation.

            MS. WILKINSON:  To a certain extent, it is, your

   Honor.  For example, when an agent finds a piece in that 302,

   it's documented.  What they're asking --

            THE COURT:  Hasn't somebody put it all together?

            MS. WILKINSON:  We're only in the process of putting

   it together for those items we're introducing.  As the Court

   might imagine, we're not going to introduce every piece of

   evidence that we recovered at the crime scene at the trial --

            THE COURT:  I guess I'm assuming something that I

   shouldn't assume.  I would have assumed that somebody was going

   to testify with respect to the power of the explosive device,

   at what range debris was thrown and where glass damage

   occurred, and so forth, because that relates to what size

   device you're talking about.

            MS. WILKINSON:  You're right; and generally they're

   going to say the damage went as far as whatever it was, how

   many miles or blocks, and debris was found --

            THE COURT:  And they didn't prepare a grid-type thing

   for that?

            MS. WILKINSON:  I'm just not sure, your Honor.  I



                                                                           215



   don't want to say that if we're not sure, but I will go back

   and make sure.

            MR. WYATT:  The report I'm referring to, L.J.'s

   report, under the section entitled "Charts and Plans"

   specifically says:  I have viewed a chart which showed the

   distribution of those larger components and fragments," etc.,

   and then it goes on and discussed even a second one:  "I have

   seen a plan of the recovered fragments and components of the

   truck."

            We specifically request these which are already

   prepared and have been for some time, obviously, and any others

   which she has described to the Court that may exist and relate

   to glass breakage and/or distribution of fragments and/or

   debris.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I would ask:

            Are you referring to Linda Jones' report?

            MR. WYATT:  I am, yes, ma'am.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Linda Jones is our British expert who

   is doing her independent analysis of the bomb.  She came over

   and saw our work product in process where we have charted out

   some of the pieces, and that was the document I was just

   talking about that we're going to introduce at trial.  But any

   information we have on that, we will disclose to the

   defendants.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Now, then, what I read here is



                                                                           216



   this other relates to ordnance testing where you're testing

   for, I suppose, things like effect on personnel, disabling

   qualities of the device, and things like that, where you're

   talking about actual ordnance.

            MS. WILKINSON:  So we didn't conduct a Farfield study,

   our understanding of it.

            THE COURT:  But you're doing graphs or charts of the

   actual dispersion of the debris and the glass damage.

            MS. WILKINSON:  And when we complete those, we will

   disclose those to the defense.

            THE COURT:  Good.

            MR. JONES:  May I inquire of the Court?  I don't

   understand.  Ms. Wilkinson just said there was no Farfield

   study.  Your Honor just described one, and they said they had

   that.  That's critical.  Is there a Farfield study, if I may

   inquire?

            THE COURT:  What I described was my understanding of

   the Government's response that Farfield studies refers to the

   way in which ordnance is tested.

            MR. WYATT:  To that, your Honor --

            THE COURT:  Not this device.

            MR. WYATT:  Our experts disagree with that analysis.

            THE COURT:  Well --

            MR. WYATT:  That's another issue.  That's for another

   day.



                                                                           217



            THE COURT:  Yeah.

            MR. JONES:  But I think the question is -- and I've

   been told by the experts that it is critical, and I just want

   to be sure I understand that the Government has no grid

   showing, whether it's going to be introduced or not -- there is

   no grid that shows where the debris fragments, parts of the

   building that exploded, cars were found?

            MS. WILKINSON:  I didn't say that, your Honor.  I said

   we do have that and we're in the process of putting it

   together, again, as a trial exhibit.

            THE COURT:  All right.  And that's going to be

   disclosed together with the backup.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.  Correct.

            MR. JONES:  But, your Honor, as an exhibit for trial,

   I understand; but there is no -- this study has not been used

   by the experts to form the opinion that is in the reports?

            MS. WILKINSON:  It's not a study, your Honor.  I think

   that's the problem.

            THE COURT:  That's the word that's the hangup.  I

   think if you're looking simply at charting historically where

   things got found, that's not a study.  A study is a designed

   effort to reproduce some effect.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor is right.  The charting.  The

   experts haven't been furnished a chart of where items were

   found and did not rely on it in their analysis and report of



                                                                           218



   the bomb?

            MS. WILKINSON:  I believe they relied on what we have

   to date, your Honor.  There is -- as I said, there is a grid

   that I'm aware of that shows glass breakage; and they have

   reviewed that, is my understanding.

            They have reviewed 302's and the document that we have

   in draft as to where certain pieces of evidence were found.

   They've reviewed everything that we have.  It depends on the

   expert.  Linda Jones was not with us from the beginning, so

   it's a little bit different; but our other explosives experts

   have reviewed the 302's, the evidence recovery logs, so they

   know where those pieces were found as far as it is, you know,

   necessary for them to come to their conclusions for the reasons

   your Honor already stated.

            MR. JONES:  Thank you.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. WYATT:  May I have a moment, your Honor?

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MR. WYATT:  Your Honor, I apologize.  On paragraph 22

   related to seismic examination, the Government is of the

   opinion that it's not required to produce the data itself,

   although it will give us the 302's.  The data itself may be

   exculpatory in addition to being something that our experts

   would rely upon, because we have reports that there are various

   experts who dispute the findings.  And that is something that



                                                                           219



   if they have in their possession, which the U.S. Geological

   Survey, I believe, would be one of the Government's agencies

   would have, I think we should be entitled to that information

   for our own interpretation, because that is an issue that is

   very much in dispute.

            THE COURT:  Well, there is a difference here between

   seismic data and seismic examinations, analyses and reports.

            Now, seismic data, as I understand it, are those

   little things that go up and down on a graph.  Seismograph, I

   think they call it.

            MR. WYATT:  Correct, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  All right.  That's data.

            Now, the analysis and report is a different issue.

            MR. WYATT:  I would agree with that, your Honor; and

   to that extent we would request to modify our request to

   include the seismic data so that our own experts can render an

   opinion.

            THE COURT:  Make their own opinion.  All right.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I believe we've already

   provided the seismic data to them, those charts.  In fact, I

   recall it's also on the 1A list inventory, so it's available to

   them; but I think I recall -- and I'm now just going from

   memory -- that we provided this months ago, the actual charts;

   and there is someone in Oklahoma who has had a discussion with

   Dr. Holtzer, the person in California who works for the U.S.



                                                                           220



   Geological Survey, about the data.  We're not calling the

   expert, the witness, so he's never done a report for us.

            THE COURT:  I understand.

            MS. WILKINSON:  But any information we have, we've

   disclosed or made available to the defense.

            MR. WYATT:  We accept that representation, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. WYATT:  Paragraph 23 deals with the blueprints of

   the Murrah Building which for obvious reasons are beneficial to

   both parties.

            The issue on this is when we're going to receive them;

   and I recognize they may not have the most recent copy; but on

   May 21 of this year, I had a meeting along with Robert Warren

   of my office with representatives of the prosecution.  They

   asked whether we would accept an older copy.  We said yes,

   pending production of the most recent copy available at the

   time of the explosion.

            We don't have either one, and these are --

            THE COURT:  Well, the response is they have been

   recently obtained and will be provided.

            MS. WILKINSON:  That's correct.  They're in the

   process of being copied, your Honor.  It won't be long.

            THE COURT:  All right.  That should be just a few

   days, then.

            MR. WYATT:  And then finally, paragraph 24 -- maybe I



                                                                           221



   shouldn't say "finally."  There is more than that.

            THE COURT:  There is a 25, too.

            MR. WYATT:  Yes, sir.  I apologize.

            We do agree that the Government has produced many of

   these items, your Honor; but again, it's still only limited to

   18 of the 31 or 32 experts; and we do expect to receive any

   additional reports which are outstanding and lab notes and

   other bases of their opinions.

            I believe that that's resolved by other --

            MS. WILKINSON:  For the record, your Honor, that's

   incorrect.  We've provided written summaries for all of our

   experts, not just for the 18.  The only limitation on 18 are

   for notes.  But we've provided written summaries of testimony

   or the actual reports for every witness, expert witness who has

   completed their examination.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.  Most of that is in that notebook,

   isn't it?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Correct.  And we've supplemented that

   with reports we've received from outside experts recently and

   will continue to do so as we receive those reports.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. WYATT:  We can accept that, and the issue also

   addresses the ATF examination, if there was one; and I

   understand Ms. Wilkinson is going to check with them regarding

   that.



                                                                           222



            Paragraph --

            THE COURT:  Wait a minute.

            MR. WYATT:  I'm sorry, your Honor --

            THE COURT:  Wait a minute.  There is some question

   about that.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I'm not sure what he's referring to

   that I'm going to go back to ATF and check whether that was an

   examination.

            MR. WYATT:  I believe that was referring to those

   photographs.  I believe that Mr. Jones addressed that, and you

   addressed that with the Court.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I thought we said there wasn't an

   examination, it was a mock device, and there is an ATF

   chronology that's been provided to the defense.

            MR. WYATT:  Excuse me, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  These photographs here of the truck.

            MR. WYATT:  Excuse me, your Honor.  If that's the

   representation, we have to accept it.

            THE COURT:  That's been made; and I have accepted it,

   and you will have to accept it.

            MR. WYATT:  Your Honor, may I have just a moment,

   please?

            THE COURT:  Yeah.  That covered 25, didn't it?

            MR. WYATT:  Your Honor, I believe -- and I may be

   mistaken -- that there still are some other expert summaries



                                                                           223



   which may not have been provided; and the only example I can

   think of right now is the Failure Analysis report or summary.

            There may be others, but that's one that comes to

   mind.  And I may be mistaken.

            MS. WILKINSON:  He is mistaken, your Honor.  There is

   two people from Failure Analysis we are considering calling,

   and we have provided summaries for both of those individuals.

            MR. WYATT:  And the entomologist.

            MS. WILKINSON:  He has not completed his examination.

            THE COURT:  Do you know when?

            MS. WILKINSON:  We have contacted all the experts and

   asked them to complete their examinations by December 18 --

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MS. WILKINSON:  -- to the extent that's possible; and

   I believe it will be for all.  We may have one problem with our

   expert in England, because she's actively working on other

   cases for the British Government; but other than that, they

   should all be finished by then.

            MR. WYATT:  Your Honor, I believe that resolves all of

   the issues -- pending in the expert witness motions for

   discovery, that is.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Well, the exculpatory

   evidence -- most of that relates to things that we have to do

   in chambers, nonpublic.  We have the closed-circuit television

   issue for 9:00 in the morning.  I think rather than start up



                                                                           224



   anything else now, we'll just come back at 9:00 in the morning,

   considering the level of my patience here, so . . .

            MR. HARTZLER:  No objection.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, we have two issues I

   believe we could resolve.  I believe they're questions

   Mr. Jones raised this morning.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MS. WILKINSON:  He asked about satellite photographs

   and we checked on the NASA 1A listing, and that is a

   photograph.  It says, "a shuttle photograph."  I don't know

   whether that means it's from the satellite, but it's available

   for the defense.  It's for McPherson, Kansas.  I have the

   picture with me.  It really doesn't show you anything; but

   we'll provide it, if Mr. Jones would like it.

            Mr. Jones, you can see how helpful that is.

            MR. JONES:  This is precisely what I was looking for,

   your Honor.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I think you can see Mr. McVeigh down

   there.

            MR. JONES:  And Mr. Hartzler and I count six agents --

            THE COURT:  What's the other one?

            MS. WILKINSON:  The polygraph information that

   Mr. Woods raised; and we are going to go back out to the field

   offices to collect -- to ensure that we have all the

   information, the questions, the charts and reports; and we



                                                                           225



   understand that in some cases, the polygraphers wrote a 302,

   not in all cases.  We will try and collect all of that

   information and provide it to both defendants.

            THE COURT:  All right.  We'll accept that offer.

            And we'll recess till 9:00 tomorrow morning.

       (Recess at 4:27 p.m.)

<P> In this three-day hearing, lawyers argued over what evidence the prosecution must turn over to the defense. Prosecutors are obliged to provide the defendants any evidence they consider using in a trial as well as any information that might help the defense side. Defendant Timothy McVeigh's attorney, Stephen Jones, asked for details on negotiations between authorities and Michael Fortier, a former associate of McVeigh's who is expected to testify for the government in exchange for a plea agreement. Jones contended that Fortier changed his story as part of deal to avoid trial.</P>

                             PROCEEDINGS

       (In open court at 9:00 a.m.)

            THE COURT:  We're resumed in 96-CR-68, and I think we

   have the same appearances as yesterday.

            MR. HARTZLER:  Yes, your Honor.

            MR. JONES:  Yes, your Honor.

            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  As I indicated yesterday in suggesting the

   order in which we'll proceed in these hearings, we will take up

   the matter of the proposal by the Government for establishing

   criteria for admission to closed-circuit televised proceedings

   pursuant to the statute and also a collateral petition filed

   and designated as 96-X-134 as The Matter of Petition of

   Oklahoma Media Group, and I suggest that since that involves

   counsel representing that petitioner and not parties to the

   case that we take and hear from counsel for the petitioners

   first and then have responses to that from the parties, then go

   to the Government's motion.

            So in that, Mr. Kelley, you're here on behalf of the

   petitioners along with Mr. Minnis?

            MR. KELLEY:  Yes, your Honor.  Mr. Minnis will argue.

            THE COURT:  All right, Mr. Minnis, you may proceed.  I

   take it you received the responses from the parties to the

   petition?

            MR. MINNIS:  Yes, sir.



                                                                           229



            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. MINNIS:  Thank you, very much.  We have asked for,

   that when the broadcast is made to Oklahoma City, that in

   providing access, that preferences be given to a certain

   portion for the media as the representatives of the general

   community.  In response to that motion, if we understand, the

   objections that have been raised by all parties really to the

   motion fall into two categories.  One, that the statute is only

   meant for victims, and victims only.  And in a very direct

   sense, not in an indirect sense.  And second, that the media

   does not qualify for the second prong about inconvenience or

   expense.  We would like to address each one of these in turn.

            First, we would concede that the statute itself was

   motivated almost exclusively by concern for the victims.  But

   we would suggest that the Act itself does not restrict itself

   to victims.  The Act provides that this Court can provide

   access to anyone that the Court determines has a compelling

   interest in being there, and is otherwise unable to attend by

   reason of inconvenience or expense.

            And we would suggest that the media has a compelling

   interest in attending based on its role as a surrogate for the

   general community.  We would quote from Press Enterprise about

   one of the purposes for trials and the openness of trials.

   This openness is what is sometimes described as a community

   therapeutic value.  Criminal acts, especially violent crimes,



                                                                           230



   often provoke public concern, even outrage and hostility.  This

   in turn generates a community urge to retaliate and desire to

   have justice.  Whether this is viewed as retribution or

   otherwise is irrelevant.  When the public is aware that the law

   is being enforced and the criminal justice system is

   functioning, an outlet is provided for these understandable

   reactions and emotions.

            This Court has understandably, for very good legal

   reasons, moved this Court out of the community where the crime

   occurred.  If the broadcast is going to be broadcast back to

   that community, we would suggest that a compelling interest is

   a compelling interest of the general community for these

   therapeutic reasons in the viewing process.

            Second, if the Act is so narrowly interpreted as the

   parties have suggested, only to victims, then we would be

   establishing precedent in this case that's rather strange.  And

   that is this case is an odd case in the sense of the number of

   victims.  We may have hundreds, thousands of victims in this

   case.  But in the normal criminal case, you may have only ten

   or 15.  And if you restrict a closed-circuit broadcast only to

   victims, then in future cases, you may have a situation in

   which you're broadcasting back to five or ten people.  We would

   suggest that that's not a rational interpretation or proper

   construction of the act.

            In meeting the second prong; that is, about the



                                                                           231



   expense of travel and what have you, we would agree with that

   and we would suggest to the Court that there are members of the

   media who can meet that test.  The communities in Oklahoma --

   although some of the major newspapers, the major television

   stations are and may be part of the pool provided access here

   at the criminal location, there are many members of the media

   who cannot afford this expense:  radio, television, and mostly

   also small newspapers.

            There are communities like Edmond just to the north of

   Oklahoma City who have lost many people in the tragedy and who

   have been terribly affected.  Midwest City, Norman, each one of

   these cities has a newspaper who would have a different angle

   and a different message to bring to their community based on

   the trial.  In addition, the presence at the trial would be

   giving an opportunity for these people to observe what takes

   place in a public forum.

            We would suggest also that when you have the

   Government providing this type of a forum, that it should not

   be restricting it just to very limited numbers of people but

   that it serves a very wide and broad purpose.  And that we

   shouldn't be establishing small little classes of people that

   they're the only ones that get to attend certain publicly

   sponsored functions.

            In this case, the attendance will serve very

   compelling interests.  The media as a surrogate, when you have



                                                                           232



   limited seating, is someone that should be granted some

   preferential access if the seating is to be limited.  In

   addition, we would suggest that the access shouldn't in general

   be restricted because you may have -- this trial may last -- I

   don't know -- six months, a year, who knows.  But during that

   period of time, we would suggest that the courtroom or wherever

   the closed-circuit broadcast may be taking place may not always

   be filled and what reason is there possibly for restricting

   access to what is a public trial or at least a broadcast of a

   public trial.  So we would respectfully urge the Court that

   when it enters its order, that it provides some preference for

   the local media in Oklahoma City.  Thank you, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  Let me ask you a couple of questions based

   on the filing that you made here, the written submission.  As I

   understand it, you differ from the parties with respect to

   where the viewing should be in Oklahoma City.  The context here

   of the parties' submission has been to a courtroom.  And you're

   suggesting here, as I understand it, that it need not be a

   courtroom but could be a place with greater seating capacity;

   is that right?

            MR. MINNIS:  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.

            THE COURT:  And the statute doesn't say one way or the

   other.

            MR. MINNIS:  That's correct.

            THE COURT:  You also, as I understand it, have raised



                                                                           233



   the question of the constitutionality of the Act if it's

   interpreted as narrowly as the parties have done.  Because, as

   I understand your position -- and you've, of course, relied

   here in your oral argument on precedent -- is that we -- that

   the televised trial proceedings should be considered in the

   same fashion as the proceeding here in the courtroom.

            MR. MINNIS:  Yes, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  What -- I have difficulty with that part

   of it, the constitutionality of it, and that constitutionality

   has been attacked upon other grounds here, but we were already

   past that.  You know, the trial proceeding is in the courtroom

   in Denver.

            MR. MINNIS:  Yes, sir.

            THE COURT:  And all that we have then transmitted is,

   as you say, an extension of the courtroom, but I'm not sure it

   is an extension of the courtroom.  It's communication, direct

   communication, but it's not the courtroom, as you seem to

   suggest when you say that it could be in some other setting,

   with greater seating.

            MR. MINNIS:  Yes, sir.

            THE COURT:  It's a limited broadcast, really, of the

   trial.  I'm not sure that the, you know, your argument that it

   doesn't have to be in a courtroom and so forth squares with the

   concept that it's a trial proceeding and, therefore, subject to

   constitutional access.



                                                                           234



            MR. MINNIS:  Well, as it was framed -- perhaps we're

   mixing and matching.  As it was framed by the suggestions by

   the United States, it would have taken place in a courtroom and

   it would have had a judge.  As I understand it, that's what

   they've suggested.

            THE COURT:  Judicial officer.

            MR. MINNIS:  Yes.  And if that is so, then that comes

   closer to the paradigm that you suggested.  But I was going to

   suggest that under these circumstances -- which is that we've

   taken the trial out of the community where the crime has been

   committed and we've moved it to another location and then we're

   going to broadcast it back -- that really what we're doing is

   we're serving the same therapeutic value that was discussed in

   Press Enterprise for the local community who is not given the

   opportunity, other than through the national media or through

   the big chains that attend the trial in Denver.

            THE COURT:  Now, would you have -- under the matter of

   inconvenience and expense, would you have applications made by

   the particular media entities showing a financial inability?

            MR. MINNIS:  Yes, sir.  That would meet that prong.

   Each one would have to meet that prong.  Just like I would

   suggest that the same thing would be true of any of the people

   that are going to -- to -- every person, as I understand it,

   has to meet that test that would be given access.

            THE COURT:  All right.  And what you're telling me is



                                                                           235



   there are those there who could meet the test?

            MR. MINNIS:  Yes, sir, I do believe they can.

            THE COURT:  Now, if I were to go with your view that

   because the statute does not require transmission into a

   courtroom, that it could be to some other locale, what would

   you suggest?

            MR. MINNIS:  In terms of --

            THE COURT:  -- the place in Oklahoma City where the

   transmission would go to.  I mean, obviously, if we were to

   attempt to accommodate all who may meet the criteria under the

   statute of having a compelling interest and so forth, you know,

   it's been represented to me here that in the United States

   Attorney's office, they have the names of several thousand.

            MR. MINNIS:  Yes, sir.

            THE COURT:  And I'm concerned in creating some sort of

   a theater or arena type atmosphere for these proceedings then

   to be viewed.  What are you suggesting if it isn't a courtroom?

            MR. MINNIS:  Well, I have not done a survey of the

   available places, but it occurs to me that there are locations

   other than a courtroom where you could have an orderly

   situation where you could view the trial.

            THE COURT:  You mention here a court-martial

   proceeding out at Tinker Air Force Base that apparently was

   broadcast.

            MR. MINNIS:  Yes, sir.  In that case, it was a



                                                                           236



   controversial case having to do with a shootdown of our own

   planes by an AWACS pilot, and there was a lot of national,

   international interest in it.  And what happened, they

   broadcast it on a small little TV in a -- basically, a

   warehouse.  And they had guards outside that searched you and

   they had people inside to make sure that the decorum was

   maintained, but other than they allowed perfect access and

   therefore no circus-like atmosphere.

            THE COURT:  That was done by order of the Court?

            MR. MINNIS:  The Court, I think, did that.

            THE COURT:  Just to accommodate, essentially, the

   great public interest?

            MR. MINNIS:  The great public interest and the fact

   that not everybody could attend the trial.

            THE COURT:  So in a sense, are you saying that the

   media groups who could meet the -- or entities who could meet

   the criteria for inability, inconvenience, and expense are

   surrogates for the victims?

            MR. MINNIS:  The general community as a victim.  Every

   crime has an impact on the community as a whole.  The idea that

   a crime only affects the particular victim is -- I think is not

   supported by the case law.

            THE COURT:  In a very legal sense, the fabric, the

   community of the United States is a victim.

            MR. MINNIS:  That's correct.



                                                                           237



            THE COURT:  That's why the cases are prosecuted in the

   name of the United States.

            MR. MINNIS:  That's correct, exactly.

            THE COURT:  But there would be no limitation, then,

   and what the Government has suggested is that when the Congress

   has used the term "victim" in this statute, they are using it

   in the same sense as in the 1990 Victim Rights and Restitution

   Act.

            MR. MINNIS:  Yes, sir, they did, but in the statute,

   itself, in establishing the criteria, they didn't use the word

   "victim."  They used "compelling interest."  And I think

   that --

            THE COURT:  In the legislative purpose as described in

   the statute, they used "victim."

            MR. MINNIS:  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  As I said, I

   concede right off the bat that the driving force for this act

   was for victims.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.

            MR. MINNIS:  Victims of crimes.  But if you limit it

   just to victims, you're going to have a closed-circuit

   broadcast, I would suggest, to a handful of people which I

   don't think makes any sense, nor is it something that would be

   really the purpose of it.

            THE COURT:  Thank you.

            MR. MINNIS:  Thank you, very much.



                                                                           238



            THE COURT:  Who is going to argue this for the

   Government?  Ms. Behenna?

            MS. BEHENNA:  Yes, your Honor.  I want to first, your

   Honor, address the constitutional issue because I really don't

   think the issue raised by Mr. Minnis and the media group on the

   constitutional level is applicable in this case.  And the Court

   has gone to unprecedented lengths to make sure that the media

   has access to this trial.  I think it's clear from a reading of

   the statute, your Honor, that the intended group that this

   legislation was supposed to provide for -- it says it in its

   heading and it says it numerous times throughout the statute --

   and that is to permit victims of a crime to watch criminal

   proceedings in cases where, you know, venue has been changed to

   a location more than 350 miles from the place where the trial

   was originally set.

            I am concerned, your Honor, if the media is allowed

   access to the closed-circuit TV, it is not the trial, it is not

   what's happening in the well of this courtroom that the media

   is going to be reporting on.  What they're going to be

   reporting on is what the victims are seeing and saying about

   what they view in the closed-circuit TV courtroom in Oklahoma

   City.  That is not their right.

            THE COURT:  They can be talking about the trial, too.

   They will be observing two things:  They will be observing the

   television transmission of the trial, and they will be



                                                                           239



   observing the audience reaction.

            MS. BEHENNA:  But they have a right to observe the

   trial here, your Honor.  There is a press pool.  Information is

   spread out throughout all national, local, and even small press

   in Oklahoma City.  I can pick up numerous papers every time I

   go to Oklahoma City and find articles about what's happened in

   the trial in those papers.  So they have access.  I'm just

   concerned that the primary motivation for being in the

   closed-circuit room with the victims is so they can watch their

   reactions to what's going on and report that.  And that is not

   their right.

            As a matter of fact, I think the U.S. Attorney's

   Office under the Victims Bill of Rights has an obligation to

   protect the dignity and privacy of the victims.  The statute

   kind of aligns with that.  It is very clear that it is supposed

   to be for victims of crime.  Victims of crimes have a right to

   view these proceedings.  We all agree on that.  And they also

   have a right to view that in the dignity and privacy of their

   own group without having media persons watching them and

   reporting on what their reactions are.

            THE COURT:  I suppose there will be those outside of

   the building -- wherever it is that the transmission goes to --

   that do the same thing, to ask them their reactions.

            MS. BEHENNA:  I assume, and there's nothing we can do

   about that, your Honor.



                                                                           240



            THE COURT:  And it's up to them whether to respond or

   not.

            MS. BEHENNA:  Exactly.  I'm saying for the dignity and

   privacy of these victims and to maintain decorum of the

   courtroom proceeding, which is important to all of us, that the

   media should not be allowed access to the closed-circuit TV.

            THE COURT:  You view this, really, as a private

   showing.

            MS. BEHENNA:  Yes, for victims of crime that meet the

   statutory requirements established by Congress.

            THE COURT:  So it's not an extension of the courtroom.

   It is an opportunity for viewing by a limited number of -- by

   people who can qualify under the statutory standard which you

   say includes victim, compelling interest of victims.

            MS. BEHENNA:  Yes, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  I think I understand your position.

            MS. BEHENNA:  Yes, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  For Mr. McVeigh.  All right, Mr. Nigh.

            MR. NIGH:  Thank you, your Honor.  In reference to the

   points raised by the media group, the first one primarily was

   the community therapeutic value of being able to attend the

   proceedings, and I would submit on behalf of Mr. McVeigh that

   that therapeutic value, of course, can be met through the

   reporting of the proceedings that occur here in Denver and not

   necessarily through the proceedings that occur in Oklahoma.  We



                                                                           241



   would view the proceeding as an extension of the courtroom

   designed specifically for the purposes identified by Congress

   for a very limited group.  And I think that the victims are the

   identified group and that the interest doesn't descend beyond

   that, but we would --

            THE COURT:  So you agree that it's really a private

   showing for persons particularly to be identified?

            MR. NIGH:  Yes, your Honor, but I also view it as an

   extension of the courtroom and a --

            THE COURT:  Those are not the same thing, really.  I

   think that the media has an argument if you look at it as

   simply an extension of the courtroom because then we are

   talking about a public forum.  But if we look at it as a very

   limited opportunity for private viewing, then I think we don't

   encounter the constitutional issues that are generated by

   looking at it as a public forum, an extension of a public

   forum.

            MR. NIGH:  I recognize that, and I think that that's

   the problem that's created by the statute.

            THE COURT:  You still think the statute's

   unconstitutional.  I realize that.

            MR. NIGH:  Certainly, that's correct.  But I think

   that the statute puts us in that dilemma, but the statute --

   the way that it's drafted and the legislative history of the

   statute, I think, makes it relatively clear who it was designed



                                                                           242



   to service and to serve.  But in the context of what we're

   doing here, I think it also has to be viewed as a judicial

   proceeding because of the other interests that are at stake and

   because of the other rules that are involved in order to

   maintain its constitutionality.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.

            For Mr. Nichols.

            MR. NEUREITER:  Reid Neureiter for Mr. Nichols, your

   Honor.

            THE COURT:  Good morning.

            MR. NEUREITER:  The Congress, when it created this

   statute, was clearly struggling with the conflict between

   giving access to victims from Oklahoma who could not otherwise

   attend the proceedings and ensuring that the defendants' fair

   trial rights would not be infringed because of excessive

   publicity, principles imposed by Rule 503 which the statute

   overrules to a certain extent.  Thus, the statute allows for

   closed-circuit television transmission to a select group of

   viewers found by the Court to have a compelling interest in

   observing the proceedings while also ensuring that any tapes of

   the broadcast will remain under seal of the Court and ensuring

   that the signal would not be publicly disseminated.

            The press has two constitutional arguments,

   essentially, for why they should be allowed access.  The first

   is the general proposition that wherever public -- the public



                                                                           243



   is allowed on public property, the press should also be allowed

   in.  And the second is that this is like a courtroom and

   anything that happens in a courtroom is public property and,

   therefore, they should be allowed in for that reason.

            Well, the Congress is constitutionally entitled to

   limit public and press access to Government property if the

   limitation is rational and underinclusive; that is to say, the

   Congress can create a limited public forum as long as the

   limitation does not extend beyond the purpose for which the

   forum was created.

            Cases that affirm such limitations are legion.  Cox 

   vs. Louisiana, for example, makes reference to the kinds of

   limits that may be properly placed on demonstrations outside a

   courtroom.

            As the Court said in Houchin vs. KQED, The press has

   no special right of access to prison facilities under the

   constitution.

            Quoting Chief Justice Warren's words from Zummell vs. 

   Rusk, the Court there said, There are few restrictions on

   actions which could not be clothed in the ingenious argument in

   the guise of decreased data flow.  For example, the prohibition

   of unauthorized access to the White House diminishes the

   citizen's opportunities to gather information he might find

   relevant to his opinion of the way the country is being run,

   but that does not make entry into the White House a First



                                                                           244



   Amendment right.  The right to speak and publish does not carry

   with it the unrestrained right to gather information.

            Thus, it is apparent that Congress may

   constitutionally limit public or press access to otherwise

   public property for rational reasons.  An imminently rational

   reason in this case is to provide victims with a remote viewing

   area for the trial without unduly infringing on the defendants'

   fair trial rights.

            Then we get to the second argument; that this is

   somehow an extension of the courtroom.  The press argues that

   because of the qualified First Amendment and common-law rights

   of access, courtrooms are always presumptively open to the

   press.  In citing Craig vs. Harney, they say whatever happens

   in the courtroom is public property.  But fortunately, whenever

   the Supreme Court uses a pithy statement like that, it explains

   what it means by giving reasons.  And there are reasons why.

   The reasons why the public tradition of openness in courtrooms

   are enunciated in the Richmond Newspapers case.  The many

   benefits of the Anglo-American tradition of public trials

   include giving assurance that all the proceedings are being

   conducted fairly to all concerned, to discourage perjury, to

   discourage misconduct of trial participants, to discourage

   decisions based on secret bias or partiality.  And these

   justifications are reiterated in the Press Enterprise case.

   The key point is all these justifications refer to what's



                                                                           245



   happening on this side of the bar --

            THE COURT:  Well, in a sense, though, and this -- here

   I am operating under a congressional mandate to make this

   viewing opportunity available to the persons qualifying under

   the statute.

            MR. NEUREITER:  Yes, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  So I suppose, in a way, there's a public

   interest in making sure I'm doing that.

            MR. NEUREITER:  Yes, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  And that argument hasn't been especially

   made by the media group here, but I suppose you could say that

   they have an interest in seeing that what is being done in the

   receiving room in Oklahoma City is consistent with the statute.

            MR. NEUREITER:  That is true, and that would impose a

   slippery slope that would require every potential aspect of

   this case, including many of the proceedings that go on in

   chambers, also to be open to the public.  Here, however --

            THE COURT:  I'm sure they would join you in saying

   that's true.

            MR. NEUREITER:  The point is, though, that it's a

   qualified First Amendment access.  And there are numerous

   Supreme Court cases that talk about limitations involving the

   fair trial rights of the defendant and that permit some of the

   proceedings to happen back in chambers.  Here, the Congress has

   enunciated specific reasons why this should be a limited area



                                                                           246



   for the sake of the victims, while at the same time ensuring

   that although Rule 53 has been violated to a certain extent in

   our view, it isn't completely violated by having that message

   beamed to everyone simultaneously.  So it isn't a truly

   national broadcast.  This isn't a black or white situation.

            Congress tried to balance the interests at stake,

   taking into account the interests of the victims; and I think

   this is one of those rare situations so far in this case where

   the interests of the victims truly do coincide with the victims

   (sic) of the defendants; and Congress has agreed that those are

   legitimate interests served by narrowly construing the statute

   to allow only those who have been directly affected by the

   blast into the viewing area.  So that's our position, and we

   believe the press should be denied access.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            Well, Mr. Minnis, do you have some rebuttal you wish

   to make?

            MR. MINNIS:  One of the things I think we've lost

   sight of here -- and it's puzzled me when I saw all the

   objections that have been raised -- is what's the great concern

   about more of the public seeing what takes place in a

   courtroom.  After all, what is going to be broadcast is what's

   taking place in the courtroom; and I'm at a loss to understand

   what harm is done by allowing a liberal interpretation of who

   should have been provided access to see what essentially is a



                                                                           247



   public trial.  One of the things that --

            THE COURT:  I don't know that, you know, that the

   case, the issue, should be decided on the basis of harm or

   prejudice.  What is of concern here is that, as you well know,

   Rule 53 is there that prohibits the broadcast of federal

   criminal trials.  Here we have a modification of that for

   purposes of cases where there has been the change of venue, and

   so forth.  And I think that the public policy that is involved

   and has to be a concern to the Court is that that modification

   be kept to a minimum.

            MR. MINNIS:  Yes, your Honor.  I understand that.  But

   I was suggesting that within the parameters that have been

   established here, as I understand Rule 53, one of the

   motivating forces for that was to make sure there is a fair

   trial to all concerned.  And if that's what's underlying that,

   we would suggest a broadcast back to Oklahoma City doesn't have

   the same problems that would be engendered, we would suggest,

   as if you had the trial itself taking place in Oklahoma City.

   Some of those have been mitigated by the moving of the trial.

            THE COURT:  Yeah, but it is not for me to determine

   broad issues of policy.  It is for me to determine what are the

   limits of this statute.

            MR. MINNIS:  Yes, your Honor.  And I think within the

   limits of the statute, there is a compelling interest that's

   being shown by the media and that the Government sponsored



                                                                           248



   events such as this, which is going to be paid for by the

   Government, should not be, as the counsel has admitted now --

   they want a private showing.  I think access certainly can be

   limited when seating is limited, but the idea that the

   Government is going around and sponsoring for special groups

   special showings, I think, is contrary to -- contrary to law.

            Thank you.

            THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, I want to go forward and

   hear, to the extent that there is disagreement on what should

   be the Court's order with respect to the transmission based on

   the Government's motion and the responses that have been made

   to that -- some disagreements have been shown in these papers.

   So perhaps the best way to approach that is to ask for the

   disagreements to be argued first and then for the Government to

   respond to that, unless there's objection, because I think in

   this motion -- I guess it's called a proposal -- the

   Government's position has been made pretty clear.  And that

   includes how a compelling interest should be identified and the

   use of the definitions in the 1990 statute and how applications

   might be made, and so forth.

            So I think it would be, as I say, more efficient to

   start with the differences and hear from counsel for the

   defendants first.

            Mr. Nigh.

            MR. NIGH:  Thank you, your Honor.  The -- I think the



                                                                           249



   first problem that we have with the Government's proposal is

   related to the argument that the proceeding will be an

   extension of the courtroom here and it's related to Rule 615.

   And we are concerned with a mechanism for ensuring that Rule

   615 of the Federal Rules of Evidence is not violated and

   ensuring that people who observe the proceedings are not

   witnesses because of the clear impact that observing the

   proceedings might have upon their testimony.  And we've briefed

   that elsewhere.  So our first concern is a procedure to ensure

   compliance with Rule 615.

            The second issue relates to actually a matter that was

   discussed yesterday in reference to discovery.  We do not

   oppose the Government's proposal concerning identification of

   the victims and people eligible to attend.  But right now that

   is entirely a one-sided proposition in terms of information.

   We do not have access to the information; and as we set forth

   yesterday in the discovery arguments, we believe that we're

   entitled to it.  And I assume that that issue will be briefed

   as well by the Government in reference to the discovery issue.

            THE COURT:  How much are you entitled to?  Names and

   addresses is I thought what you were asking for.

            MR. NIGH:  That's correct, your Honor, but right now

   we don't even have that.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.

            MR. NIGH:  And I think in order to evaluate or at



                                                                           250



   least to be cognizant of what's going on in Oklahoma City,

   we're entitled to that information at a minimum and certainly

   in reference to our view of Rule 615.

            The third difference is that in the Government's

   proposal, there is no provision made for a defense

   representative being present, and that again is related to the

   proceedings being an extension of the courtroom in Denver.  And

   we believe the reason for the importance of the defense

   representative being present is because things might occur

   which the defense is uniquely in a position to evaluate which

   might have an impact upon the proceedings here.

            THE COURT:  For example?

            MR. NIGH:  The presence of a witness perhaps or --

            THE COURT:  Well, there could be, you know, sign-in,

   sign-out.  There could be a log maintained as to who's present.

   I think all that could be accommodated, and I am of the view

   and agree with the Government that there should be a judicial

   officer designated by me there.

            MR. NIGH:  Certainly, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  So that the rules of decorum and so forth

   that this Court would establish would be enforced through that

   person.

            MR. NIGH:  Certainly, your Honor, and that takes care

   of the major concern.

            THE COURT:  Also, I have indicated in my oral ruling



                                                                           251



   on the constitutional objections to this statute that when the

   Congress says under the control of the trial court, I intend to

   have a view of what's going on in that other courtroom, if it

   be a courtroom, which seems to me it makes some sense to match

   the concern about the dignity and the interests of privacy

   interests of the people who have the compelling interest.  But

   I intend to have a view right here of what's going on down

   there.

            MR. NIGH:  Certainly, your Honor.  And that gives us,

   I think, all the reassurance that we need.  I would point out

   that there -- on occasion there have been things that have

   transpired in the auxiliary courtroom here where the audio feed

   goes that were noticed by representatives of the defense but

   perhaps not noticed by other persons.

            THE COURT:  Are you talking about a lawyer when you

   say a representative of the defense?

            MR. NIGH:  I think it would be an investigator, would

   be our proposal.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. NIGH:  Rather than having actually a lawyer attend

   the proceeding there.

            And finally, your Honor, the only other objection we

   have to the Government's proposal is the way that they have

   defined the inconvenience as being persons outside the state of

   Colorado instead of inside the state of Oklahoma.  And I would



                                                                           252



   submit that the statute was designed to accommodate those

   persons who reside in the transferring venue as opposed to

   people who reside outside the receiving venue.

            THE COURT:  I don't know how many people we might be

   talking about.  Obviously from the evidence that was presented

   in the change of venue hearing, the impact was primarily within

   several counties there around Oklahoma City, as I recall that

   evidence.  So I don't know that this is a major problem, but

   logically it strikes me that if someone were, example a family

   member of one of the deceased, and that person lives in Kansas

   or Nebraska or somewhere and could demonstrate that while they

   might have been able to go to trial if it had been held in

   someplace within the Western District of Oklahoma, that they

   couldn't come to Denver.  I mean I think the logic of it is

   there, and I don't see why this should be an issue.  If they

   can demonstrate that, why does it make any difference where

   they live.

            MR. NIGH:  If they can demonstrate that, your Honor, I

   don't think it does make a difference.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. NIGH:  That's the only issues that I see that we

   have disagreement about.

            THE COURT:  Thank you.  Mr. Neureiter, are you going

   to comment on this?

            MR. NEUREITER:  Your Honor, we have really nothing



                                                                           253



   more to add to our written submission unless your Honor has any

   specific questions.  There were very minor differences, some of

   which have been articulated by Mr. Nigh.  One was on the issue

   of what constitutes pecuniary harm.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.

            MR. NEUREITER:  But I think that's adequately

   described in our papers.

            THE COURT:  And, you know, I think it's secondary with

   Mr. Nichols', of course, because now that we have separate

   trials, we're talking about what we're going to do with

   Mr. McVeigh's case.

            MR. NEUREITER:  Yes, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  And we may learn from that.

            MR. NEUREITER:  Yes, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  So I understand.  All right.

            Miss Behenna.

            MS. BEHENNA:  Your Honor, with regard to the Rule 615

   issue and victim witnesses coming in and viewing the

   closed-circuit TV, in the Government's proposal, we propose

   that those victims that qualify under the statute should be

   given some type of photo identification much like the Court has

   suggested in this case.  I think what we can do, your Honor, is

   limit those victim witnesses -- well, they just won't be given

   a photo ID.  If they're not given a photo ID, they won't have

   access.



                                                                           254



            THE COURT:  Easily done.

            MS. BEHENNA:  And we would be willing to work with the

   Court on that in identifying the witnesses that would not be

   able to have a photo ID, so I think that's easily revolved.

            The defense representative, I agree with the Court

   that a judicial officer that will ensure the rights of the

   defendant.  If there's a defense representative, the

   prosecution is going to want a representative.  I see it

   getting out of control.  I have faith in the Court in the

   judicial officer you pick to oversee the closed-circuit TV.  So

   I think there is no need for a defense representative.

            THE COURT:  Or a Government representative.

            MS. BEHENNA:  Absolutely.  In regard to the

   inconvenience of the victim, I think the Court -- I want to

   point out for the record, there are victims in Texas, there are

   family members in Arkansas and Kansas.  And it might have been

   more convenient to come to Oklahoma.  If it's more convenient

   to come to Oklahoma to view the closed-circuit TV, I think they

   should be entitled to do that, so long as they meet the

   qualifications of the statute.

            There is one challenge that Nichols made, and I don't

   know if you want to address that right now, and that's seating

   inside the well.

            THE COURT:  No, as I said, we will have Mr. McVeigh's

   trial done and have the experience of that before we need to



                                                                           255



   address the issues -- that type of issue raised by Mr. Nichols'

   counsel.

            MS. BEHENNA:  Okay.  That leaves the issue of access

   of the names of our victims.

            THE COURT:  Well, you're going to brief that.

            MS. BEHENNA:  We're going to brief that.  I just

   wanted the Court to be aware that we object to any access to

   our names.

            THE COURT:  That's part of the scheduling that we're

   going to do today.

            MS. BEHENNA:  Yes.

            THE COURT:  But I have some questions that weren't

   raised here and they're matters of concern to me.  You know, I

   think that one thing obviously is that we would have to develop

   some form of application.

            MS. BEHENNA:  Yes.

            THE COURT:  So that the necessary information can be

   provided.  And it may be that your -- the data base you have

   could be used, and I'm sure you would use it consistent with

   your obligations under a different statute to notify the

   victims of the opportunity.

            MS. BEHENNA:  Certainly.

            THE COURT:  I mean you have to comply with the Victims

   Rights Act of 1990.  And then it seems to me that the

   applications have to come here.  I'm the one who has to rule on



                                                                           256



   them under the Act.  You agree?

            MS. BEHENNA:  Yes.

            THE COURT:  All right.  And the parties may

   participate in that.  I don't know.  We can deal with that

   later.

            MS. BEHENNA:  Right.

            THE COURT:  But you have proposed -- well, I've

   already identified that the chief judge in the Western District

   of Oklahoma has designated a room in the courthouse there for

   this viewing which is of limited seating capacity.

            MS. BEHENNA:  Right.

            THE COURT:  We can -- there's no objection to

   increasing that capacity with the temporary seating in the

   well.

            MS. BEHENNA:  Right.

            THE COURT:  So whatever the total number is, obviously

   it's going to be less than the number of applicants, I presume.

            MS. BEHENNA:  Yes.

            THE COURT:  Now, you've indicated a first-come,

   first-served approach to that.  That troubles me because one of

   the purposes to be served here of course is to attempt to meet

   some of the needs of persons who are emotionally damaged by

   this.  And it strikes me that if they're in some kind of a --

   you know, having to come to the courthouse down there in

   predawn hours to try and queue up to try to get a seat is



                                                                           257



   actually destructive and counterproductive.  And I'm wondering

   if we could think of some kind of rotating opportunity or

   something like that or whether there should be some priorities.

   You know, we don't know what the demand will be and how it may

   vary throughout the trial proceedings.  There will be some

   days, perhaps, with minimal interest.  Who knows?

            MS. BEHENNA:  Right.

            THE COURT:  But the statute, if I interpret it in the

   fashion that you've suggested which seems to me imminently

   reasonable to use the description in the other statute, the

   1990 act, and also to use the physical, emotional, and

   pecuniary loss, I would think the people who have a pecuniary

   loss only -- and I don't know how many of them there might be,

   but my recollection is some of the businesses in the area were

   interrupted or destroyed --

            MS. BEHENNA:  Absolutely.

            THE COURT:  But it seems to me that those persons have

   a lesser need to view these proceedings than persons who were

   individually maimed or injured and those who lost members of

   their family.

            MS. BEHENNA:  I just --

            THE COURT:  Couldn't we establish some priority there?

            MS. BEHENNA:  Well, I understand the Court's concern,

   and I spent a lot of time thinking about this along with Lynn

   Anderson in the victim witness unit.  We can certainly revisit



                                                                           258



   the issue and try to come up with something.  I'm concerned

   about setting priorities among victims.

            THE COURT:  Well, so am I.  I'm trying to accommodate,

   you know, the supply and demand curves here, which I think are

   going to be a problem.

            MS. BEHENNA:  I just feel uncomfortable saying that

   you have more priority because you had physical injuries as

   opposed to somebody who lost their business.

            THE COURT:  You won't have to say it.  I'll be the one

   who takes the responsibility.

            MS. BEHENNA:  I know.  Maybe that's why we left it out

   of our proposal because we were trying to put the monkey on

   your back.  I'll be happy to sit down with Lynn Anderson and

   some of the other members of the prosecution team and see if we

   can come up with a proposal.  There is sort of a lotto system

   that we have devised for the twelve seats that we have here in

   the courtroom and we might be able to do something like that on

   a rotating basis.

            THE COURT:  I sure want to try to avoid having people

   scramble for seats.

            MS. BEHENNA:  I understand that.

            THE COURT:  That's just not, I think -- as I said,

   that's counterproductive of what the legislative purpose of

   this is.

            MS. BEHENNA:  With that understanding, then, can the



                                                                           259



   Court give us -- I don't know -- just a few days to sit down

   and try to come up with something in writing that we can

   propose to the Court?

            THE COURT:  Sure.

            MS. BEHENNA:  I do have one suggestion that might

   accommodate significant trial days those days where, you know,

   the Government is putting on, you know, significant evidence,

   whatever that might be.  I have talked to Chief Judge Russell,

   and he has agreed to allow us to use his ceremonial courtroom,

   the courtroom where we had the venue hearing.

            THE COURT:  It's got to be one room.  We can't put

   equipment in and move it around.

            MS. BEHENNA:  I thought there might be -- I talked to

   the technical advisers.  They advised me that there might be

   the ability to have the TVs on carts and move around --

            THE COURT:  Whose technical advisers --

            MS. BEHENNA:  The people that I'm talking to.

            THE COURT:  Your technical advisers.

            MS. BEHENNA:  Yes, the expert that I'm consulting

   with.

            THE COURT:  Well, all right, but I have to look at

   that in terms of controlling access to the signal.

            MS. BEHENNA:  Absolutely.

            THE COURT:  I don't know if that's the word.

            MS. BEHENNA:  If what I understand --



                                                                           260



            THE COURT:  The worst thing is somebody pirates the

   signal -- we're all concerned about that -- so that this

   private viewing suddenly becomes a public viewing or, indeed,

   recorded later for viewing by someone viewing.  Those are

   things that we have to protect against.  And the primary thing

   is going to be -- and this is a technical issue, technological

   issue -- whether you can move it from one room to another in

   the middle of the trial.  In the absence of very clear proof

   that you can do that, I'm not inclined to do it.  We use one

   room and one room only.

            MS. BEHENNA:  I understand, and maybe that's something

   we should address in chambers when we're talking about the

   technical aspect and I can advise the Court how that might be

   done so we don't have pirating.  But that might be a way of

   accommodating it on opening, closing, and other significant

   events.  With those considerations, then, your Honor, I will be

   happy --

            THE COURT:  I'm not sure that it's a good thing to

   highlight particular portions of the trial, you know.

            MS. BEHENNA:  That's a consideration, as well.

            THE COURT:  I think for persons to understand the

   proceeding, they need to understand it in its context, the

   entirety of it.

            MS. BEHENNA:  I don't disagree.

            THE COURT:  One of the arguments against televised



                                                                           261



   trials that has been made and the debates about the policy, as

   you well know, is that you take a 30-second segment out of a

   case and that misrepresents what is actually going on in a

   trial.

            MS. BEHENNA:  No doubt.  With those considerations,

   then, we'll get another proposal to the Court --

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MS. BEHENNA:  -- in the next couple days.  Were there

   any other questions about our proposal that I could answer?

            THE COURT:  Not at the moment.

            MS. BEHENNA:  Thank you.

            MR. HARTZLER:  Your Honor, may I ask a point of

   clarification?

            THE COURT:  Yes, Mr. Hartzler.

            MR. HARTZLER:  As you appreciate, I'm sure, we regard

   ourselves as representing all of the victims and in terms of

   making a proposal, we're obviously more than willing to do

   that, but I understood you to be directing us to prioritize

   those that have suffered physical injury or family --

            THE COURT:  No, I'm asking for your view with respect

   to it.  I will determine whether such prioritization will take

   place.

            MR. HARTZLER:  Very well.

            THE COURT:  But I'm not making you responsible for

   that.  That's my responsibility in interpreting this act.  I'd



                                                                           262



   like to have the Government's view of it.  That's all.

            MR. HARTZLER:  Thank you.

            THE COURT:  But you see, I'm drawing a distinction

   here.  While I believe that, as I've already indicated, it is

   appropriate to use the 1990 act as, in pari materia definition

   of victim as to what the legislative purpose of this statute

   is, I do not believe that this statute should be read in

   connection with what the role of the prosecution is under the

   1990 act.

            To make this clear, the transmission is for the Court

   to decide.  And the rules of who will attend and so forth is

   for the Court to decide as a part of this criminal proceeding.

   It is not for the United States Attorney in the Western

   District of Oklahoma or the Department of Justice to decide

   under its obligations under the 1990 act.  Those are two

   different things.

            MR. HARTZLER:  We understand.

            THE COURT:  Okay.  Then I'm going to reflect on this

   and write an opinion on it.  I think it's a matter that

   deserves consideration, careful consideration and also an

   advised ruling rather than attempting to do it from the bench.

   So if you can have whatever else you're going to submit on this

   by next Monday, that will help.  And we'll get a ruling out

   rather soon.

            So these matters are formally under advisement.  Will



                                                                           263



   be as soon as the opportunity for any additional submission.

            I don't know, would you, Mr. Nigh, want to have a

   chance to respond to that?  We're really talking about whether

   the Court should consider the pecuniary loss people different

   from the physical and emotional loss.

            MR. NIGH:  I don't suspect that we will want to

   respond, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. NIGH:  If there's something in the Government's

   brief that we think demands attention, we'll --

            THE COURT:  -- ask for leave to --

            MR. NIGH:  -- opportunity to --

            THE COURT:  So I'll feel free to reflect on the matter

   as soon as next Tuesday.  That doesn't mean that's when the

   ruling will come out.  But, you know, among other things, we're

   talking about something that truly is unprecedented in the

   federal court system, a statute that is a new and different

   attempt by the Congress to accommodate competing interests.

            Now, I think that the next area of discussion

   necessarily will have to be done nonpublic.  There are two

   things really to be addressed.  One is several motions that

   raise concerns which include not only access to classified

   information in the hands of other Government agencies and also

   includes some degree of speculation and conjecture about the

   availability of evidence.  It would be, I think, irresponsible



                                                                           264



   for me to have counsel discuss that in open court where

   misinterpretation could easily happen.

            The other is that I must talk with the lawyers in the

   case very candidly on scheduling matters.  There are a number

   of things that did come up in the course of our hearing

   yesterday and the rulings made that require some additional

   submissions.  We need to set times for that.  And we also are

   going to be discussing the trial date.  So I can't do that

   responsibly in open court, either.

            Recognizing that we have counsel for the media here

   and also many members of the media as well as I'm sure those

   who also could qualify as having a compelling interest in the

   case being in the courtroom, I am always a bit concerned when I

   announce that we're going to do something in chambers, in

   secret and all that, but I hope you will understand the

   importance of some ability to discuss some of these things very

   candidly and openly with counsel and without having them

   broadcast.

            So what I'm going to, unless we have some further

   matters that follow up from yesterday or some -- yes,

   Mr. Woods.

            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may it please the Court.

   Counsel for Mr. Nichols filed a motion requesting the names of

   attendees in the meeting in Oklahoma City, and we can hear that

   tomorrow at your pleasure.



                                                                           265



            THE COURT:  I'd like to defer it right now, and I

   don't know what your interest in, is in the scheduling

   conference that we're about to do.

            MR. WOODS:  We're very interested in that, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  All right.  You may attend it.  And so

   will Mr. Nichols and Mr. McVeigh.

            MR. WOODS:  Secondly, in connection with the request

   yesterday on discovery wherein Mr. Jones made a request for

   copies of tapes of Mr. Nichols, we had responded to that and

   then also requested a modification of Judge Alley's orders

   wherein the Government is recording the conversations and

   providing them to us, but they're going one step further in

   summarizing them in 302's and then distributing them to all the

   agents, all the prosecutors involved in the case, and we don't

   see the need for that.  These are private conversations wherein

   Mr. Nichols is talking to members of his family.  He's trying

   to keep his family in existence --

            THE COURT:  Monitoring Bureau of Prisons' policy

   compared with Department of Justice in its prosecutorial role.

            MR. WOODS:  We understand that the Bureau of Prisons

   has a right to monitor those conversations and keep a recording

   of it.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.

            MR. WOODS:  But like in the Noriega case, when they

   start sharing those tapes with the Government and the



                                                                           266



   Government uses those tapes, we're concerned.  There's a

   privacy interest.

            THE COURT:  I understand.

            MR. WOODS:  That the Government has no interest in,

   there's nothing investigative concerning them.  They're merely

   personal conversations; they're distributing them.

            THE COURT:  I understand what you're saying.  Is this

   disputed?

            MR. HARTZLER:  No, it's not.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. HARTZLER:  There is a matter regarding a subpoena

   for some other tapes.  But I believe we got into this dilemma

   of some sort because we received a request for the tapes --

   there was a request for the tapes many months ago and the order

   was entered.  It will probably come as no surprise to you or

   defense counsel that we'd be pleased not to have to review

   those tapes.

            THE COURT:  Yes.  You know, that's why I said this is

   Bureau of Prisons policy and it's a matter of simply

   maintaining security and not of any investigative interest.

   Shouldn't be --

            MR. WOODS:  But we request the tapes, however.

            THE COURT:  -- to counsel for Mr. Nichols.

            MR. WOODS:  Nichols, yes, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  Well, if they're in agreement with that --



                                                                           267



   I presume they are, or you wouldn't be asking for.  I don't

   have any problem with that, do you, Mr. Hartzler?

            MR. HARTZLER:  It's just the mechanism.  Bureau of

   Prisons tapes that are created for security purposes, I don't

   know what the relevance to defense would be.  It's obviously

   their client speaking, and I'm troubled by the prospect that

   somehow these would find their way into the courtroom.  'Cause,

   I mean our discovery policy --

            THE COURT:  They won't find their way into the

   courtroom unless they're shared with the Government's counsel,

   that's clear.

            MR. HARTZLER:  Could I just have an opportunity to

   discuss with counsel for the Bureau of Prisons.  For our

   purposes, prosecution purposes, obviously the defense receives

   the tapes and listens to them for whatever purposes they have,

   and they're not going to be introduced in the courtroom, that's

   up to them, and it really should be up to them and the Bureau

   of Prisons.  I'd like to have an opportunity to discuss with

   the Bureau of Prisons.

            THE COURT:  It seems to me very reasonable to make the

   change in Judge Alley's order that really accommodates the

   legitimate Government interest with respect to the place in

   which they're held and yet protects the privacy of these

   conversations that are social, for want of a better adjective.

   Okay.



                                                                           268



            MR. WOODS:  Thank you, your Honor.

            MR. HARTZLER:  We'll be able to get back to you within

   24 hours, I'm sure.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. WOODS:  Thank you.

            THE COURT:  Well, what I propose, then, is that we

   meet about ten-thirty.

            Mr. Kelley?

            MR. KELLEY:  Your Honor, I hope you'll permit me just

   to formally object to the determination of a motion in

   chambers.  I believe I have to do that or it might be

   considered waived.

            THE COURT:  Sure.  Your objection is noted.  And

   overruled.  I'll see counsel and also Mr. McVeigh and

   Mr. Nichols at ten-thirty.

            MR. JONES:  In this room, your Honor?

            THE COURT:  No, in the conference room.  Recess.

<P> In this three-day hearing, lawyers argued over what evidence the prosecution must turn over to the defense. Prosecutors are obliged to provide the defendants any evidence they consider using in a trial as well as any information that might help the defense side. Defendant Timothy McVeigh's attorney, Stephen Jones, asked for details on negotiations between authorities and Michael Fortier, a former associate of McVeigh's who is expected to testify for the government in exchange for a plea agreement. Jones contended that Fortier changed his story as part of deal to avoid trial.</P>

       (Volumes IV through VI, pages 269 through 406, are ordered

   sealed by the Court and are not part of the public record.)

       (In open court at 3:35 p.m.)

            THE COURT:  Be seated, please.

            I'm sure that there's some interest and curiosity

   about what has been happening in chambers, and I can only tell



                                                                           409



   you that some of that will be reflected in an order to be

   entered, but that there will be some additional time in

   chambers tomorrow and that what we are doing is working out

   some scheduling and that necessarily has to be something that's

   discussed privately and then announced publicly and will be.

            Now, we do have another motion that needs to be heard

   and will be heard here, and that is what's designated as a

   Defendant McVeigh's narrowed motion to compel production of

   exculpatory evidence.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, may I consult with

   Mr. Jones for one moment?

            THE COURT:  You may.  And there's been a response.

            And, Mr. Woods, is Mr. Nichols joined in part with

   this motion or --

            MR. WOODS:  No.  Your Honor, we had our separate

   motion, and the Court has already heard just those four items.

            THE COURT:  Yes.  All right.  So we have the

   Government's response which, as in the same fashion as with the

   Rule 16, repeated the requests and gave the responses to it.

   And perhaps just as we did with the Rule 16 yesterday, we can

   go to those items and see which of them are still in dispute

   and need rulings.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, Mr. Jones has agreed to --

   graciously agreed to let me stand at the podium this afternoon

   while he sits at the table and we discuss the responses if



                                                                           410



   that's --

            THE COURT:  All right.  Do we want to set up a

   microphone there or --

            MR. JONES:  Well, I don't think I'll have trouble

   being heard, but I'll do whatever you want to do.  If you want

   a microphone for the record, that's fine.

            THE COURT:  I just want you to be heard on the tape, I

   guess.  That is the backup or auxiliary record.

            MR. JONES:  I don't think this is quite what she had

   in mind, your Honor.

            MR. HARTZLER:  It's not what I had in mind.

            THE COURT:  Do we need that microphone?

            COURTROOM DEPUTY:  No, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  All right.  You can go back to your -- to

   your own friendly environs.

            MR. JONES:  My own what?

            THE COURT:  Friendly environs.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, the first item that --

   proceeding in the order in which they are listed in the

   motion -- and I suppose it would be more accurate to

   characterize what I'm going to do is to simply put on the

   record our acceptance or rejection of where we think the

   Government has made a statement.  Most of them, we'll accept

   the representation they have made.  And by "accept," I mean

   that the Government has given us its good faith



                                                                           411



   representations, and, of course, we don't have any way to

   challenge that in the absence of evidence to the contrary.

            The first items were discovery requests which are

   clearly disputed either because we claim the Government has not

   produced in discovery or the Government has failed to make a

   representation as to the completeness of the production or

   there is some timing, and I will dispute that.  And I'll first

   take up the disputes as to the timing of production.  Some of

   these have already been addressed, but just to complete the

   record.

            1A was the name and addresses of all unindicted

   co-conspirators, and I understand the Government's response to

   be that it will provide material impeaching information for

   trial witnesses and that the Government has no obligation to

   characterize.  I assume they are referring to unindicted

   co-conspirators in that impeachment evidence.  I believe that

   in the scheduling, we should address the time when the Court

   will -- or the Government will give us the names of the

   unindicted co-conspirators, if any, and the time for which any

   further impeachment material will be provided.  Other than

   that, I think 1A is resolved.

            THE COURT:  Yes.  And we were, at least for those

   whose statements may be offered in evidence.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, your Honor.  We provided that

   proffer of the co-conspirator statements.  Obviously, we'd have



                                                                           412



   to identify any statements and who made them.

            THE COURT:  So that's one of those things that will be

   incorporated in the scheduling order to be completed tomorrow.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, your Honor.

            MR. JONES:  1B, your Honor, was all criminal

   prosecutions investigating or potential prosecutions that could

   be brought against such witnesses and other types of

   investigations concerning probation for all legal disputes with

   Government and convictions.  The Government says that it will

   produce all criminal records, which I understand to be

   convictions, and rap sheets where available for all witnesses

   intended to be called at trial.  And again, that's the question

   of timing, which I assume will be addressed in the Court's

   order.

            THE COURT:  Right.

            MR. JONES:  1C was any federal or state arrests.  The

   Government has said it will produce any criminal records for

   all witnesses intended to be called at trial, and that also

   will be covered by the Court's timing order.

            THE COURT:  Correct.

            MR. JONES:  1D was any federal or state prison

   records.  The Government has responded -- and if I

   mischaracterize the response, please let me know.  But the

   Government has responded they will disclose so long as related

   to prison records which contain impeachment or exculpatory



                                                                           413



   information.  Otherwise, not required.  We accept the

   Government's representation and that would be subject to the

   Court's timing order.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  1E was information concerning

   hospitalization for psychiatric or emotional disorders.  The

   Government will produce, if they are aware of, for witnesses

   intended to be called at trial.  That is acceptable to the

   defense and subject to the Court's timing order.

            1F is information for hospitalization for alcoholism

   or drug abuse.  The Government, if aware of it, will produce it

   for the witnesses intended to be called at trial and subject to

   the Court's timing schedule.

            1G was all information concerning psychiatric,

   emotional disorders, alcoholism or drug abuse, regardless of

   hospitalization.  The Government's response is that if they are

   aware of it, they will produce the information for witnesses

   intended to be called at trial, again to be included in the

   Court's timing order.

            1H is all information concerning veracity of any such

   person has been submitted to polygraph, sodium pentothal,

   hypnosis, et cetera.  This appears to be resolved.  And the

   Government represents that it has been delivered to us and is

   contained in 1A and 1B inventories.  And there's a question

   Mr. Woods raised which we adopted concerning the completeness



                                                                           414



   of what had been provided, and I understand Ms. Wilkinson is

   making inquiry to be sure that we have everything the FBI has.

   If that is the case, the Government's response is acceptable to

   the defense.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, we are going to make a

   further disclosure on the polygraph information, as I believe I

   represented --

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MS. WILKINSON:  -- earlier.

            THE COURT:  Particularly as to whether there are

   interpretations and summaries.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  1I is consistent or contradictory

   statements of witnesses.  The Government's response is it's

   overbroad and burdensome, but the Government has provided 302's

   and the defense can compare to determine if inconsistent or

   contradictory.  The Government also claims it is overbroad for

   nontestifying witnesses.  It is subject to the Court's

   scheduling order.  The Government's response is acceptable to

   the defense.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  1J is all statements, incident reports,

   302's, et cetera, regarding eyewitness accounts reporting

   Mr. McVeigh and other suspects in locations other than downtown



                                                                           415



   Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995.  The Government's response is

   that as to Mr. McVeigh, the Government has provided 302's.  The

   Government does not know what we mean by "other suspects."

            MS. WILKINSON:  I don't believe that's correct,

   Mr. Jones.  Or, your Honor, we -- I think we stated that we

   provided information as to other suspects.  But to the extent

   the request includes information on other individuals the

   defense considers other suspects, but of which we are unaware,

   of course we can't comply.

            THE COURT:  All right.  So you want to provide

   information on those who are suspects in the Government's view?

            MS. WILKINSON:  We've done that.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.

            MR. JONES:  All right.  K, information of prior

   misconduct or bad acts by witnesses.  The Government will

   provide it to the extent that it is aware of it for witnesses

   intended to be called at trial.  Time to be set in the Court's

   discovery -- scheduling order.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, just to be clear, I

   believe Mr. Jones is generally saying we will.  In many cases,

   we have already disclosed this and will continue to disclose.

            MR. JONES:  Thank you for the clarification.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  L, evidence of physical infirmity which

   affect the ability to perceive or recall, to be aware.  To the



                                                                           416



   extent the Government is aware of it, they have and will

   provide for testifying witnesses, again subject to being

   included in the Court's scheduling orders.

            M, admissions of poor memory or of lack of knowledge

   of any grand jury witness.  To the extent the Government is

   aware of it, they have or will provide for testifying witnesses

   subject to the Court's scheduling order.

            MS. WILKINSON:  The only difference there, your Honor,

   is that -- to the extent the request includes witness' lack of

   knowledge.  I believe the Court addressed that back in December

   that that would not be Brady, some who just didn't know a fact.

            THE COURT:  Right.

            MR. JONES:  N, information concerning reputation.  If

   such person --

            THE COURT:  Well, excuse me.  With this modification:

   That if the person professes a lack of knowledge on one

   occasion but knowledge on another occasion, that's like an

   inconsistent statement.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Of course.  That would be impeachment

   material under Giglio.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  Item N, information concerning reputation

   if such person is questionable for telling the truth.  The

   Government's response is to the extent aware, the Government

   has or will provide for testifying witnesses.  Again, to be



                                                                           417



   included in the Court's scheduling order.

            O has been withdrawn.

            P, contradictory statements or conflicting statements

   concerning involvement of Mr. McVeigh or any associate,

   accomplice or co-conspirator or co-defendant.  The Government's

   response is overbroad and burdensome, but the Government has

   provided 302's.  Defense can compare to determine if

   inconsistent or contradictory.  This is overbroad for

   nontestifying witnesses.  Our response is that in view of the

   Government's representation that all witnesses' statements will

   be provided, we accept the Government's representation, and the

   balance of it would be included in the Court's scheduling

   order.

            Q, evidence inculpating the witness or indicating the

   witness' involvement in the alleged offense or refusal to

   inculpate Mr. McVeigh; for example, the Fortier statements on

   CNN.  The Government's response is the Government has

   disclosed.  And as it becomes aware, it will provide materially

   impeaching material for trial witnesses; i.e., testifying

   witnesses.  Our response is that we previously identified our

   definition of what is materially exculpating material, and the

   Government's response is otherwise acceptable, and the material

   cutoff date would be included in the Court's scheduling order.

            No. 127.  All claims filed for the $2 million reward

   for information leading to the arrest of those involved in the



                                                                           418



   Oklahoma City bombing.  I believe that matter was resolved

   yesterday.

            The next items are disputes as to completeness of

   production.  No. 3, impeachment because of an -- inaccurate or

   misleading information has been resolved by the Government's

   response.

            Items 10, 11, 52, have been withdrawn.

            53 was modified.  Identification of objects germane to

   the Oklahoma City bombing investigation and the collection of

   fingerprints of undisclosed or unidentified individuals or

   suspects in this case has been resolved by the Government's

   response.

            No. 82, identity and statements of informants has been

   resolved by the Government's response.

            Third category, disputes as to evasiveness of

   production.  No. 15 -- and that's our characterization when I

   say "evasiveness of production."

            No. 15 modified, request any evidence that a

   Government bomb expert was present at the scene at the time of

   the explosion.  I believe that that has been resolved by the

   Government's pleadings in which they indicated the presence of

   Special Agent Eberhardt -- I believe he is of the ATF -- who

   was in the federal courthouse.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.  Agent Eberhardt had left the

   Murrah Building shortly before 9:00 to walk over to the federal



                                                                           419



   courthouse to watch an arson trial.

            MR. JONES:  No. 18 which is one that is still, I

   think, disputed.  We asked your Honor in that one for

   Government contacts with civil litigants.  We were particularly

   interested if the Government had contacted the plaintiff in the

   case or her lawyer, Mr. Hayes, in the original civil suit that

   was filed against Mr. McVeigh that -- that was pending in

   Canadian County.

            The Court may recall that late Friday afternoon before

   the depositions were scheduled on Monday, the depositions --

   the civil suit was dismissed.  And we were not notified and we

   had the expense of going to Kansas to take the deposition.  Of

   course, the witnesses did not appear because suit had been

   dismissed.  They were aware of it, we weren't.  And we asked

   the Court to order the Government to disclose to us any

   contacts with the civil litigants that may have led to the

   dismissal of that case.  And the Government says it's beyond

   Brady.

            THE COURT:  Are you pressing that one?

            MR. JONES:  Well, I think it's material, your Honor,

   because it might constitute pressure on the witness to dismiss

   the case or might constitute witness tampering if they had such

   contact.  They may not have had the contact.  Their response

   doesn't say one way or the other, as I recall.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.  The response is in the way of an



                                                                           420



   objection.  Can't you just respond to that no if that's the --

   if that's correct?

            MS. WILKINSON:  We're not aware of any contact, your

   Honor, by Government agents to the civil litigants, but the

   point I think was that under Brady, we didn't see how that was

   exculpatory to Mr. McVeigh.  I'm not sure --

            THE COURT:  If the answer is no, answer it no and we

   can move on without worrying about it.  Arguments as to whether

   it is or is not exculpatory --

            MS. WILKINSON:  Could I have a moment, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  Sure.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I believe that there was a reason I

   gave you a legal response, your Honor; Mr. Ryan did speak with

   the plaintiff's lawyer.

            THE COURT:  I -- I'm trying to remember who the

   plaintiff was.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Mr. Ryan?  Edye Smith.

            MR. JONES:   Brandy Liggons is who I had.

            THE COURT:  I think we're talking about two different

   lawsuits.

            MR. RYAN:  I don't know anything about the Brandy

   Liggons lawsuit.  To my knowledge, I've never spoken to her

   lawyer.  I don't know who her lawyer is.  Didn't know she had a

   lawsuit.

            MR. JONES:  Gaylon Hayes was her lawyer.



                                                                           421



            MR. RYAN:  Excuse me?

            MR. JONES:  Gaylon Hayes was her lawyer.

            MR. RYAN:  That doesn't mean anything to me.  Maybe

   it's faulty because I haven't thought about this.  It's been a

   long time ago.  I was thinking it was Edye Smith that had filed

   a lawsuit over in Canadian County.

            THE COURT:  That's still going, that lawsuit?

            MR. RYAN:  Right.

            THE COURT:  That's the one where there's the motion to

   stay it because of its interference with this prosecution,

   which is one of those things that I've never actually issued an

   order on.  We stayed it, but not with a formal and final order.

   Isn't that the state of the record?

            MR. JONES:  It is.  Well, I wasn't asking about the

   Edye Smith lawsuit.

            THE COURT:  That's not being inquired about.  This is

   an earlier case, isn't it?

            MR. JONES:  It is.  It's the first one.  And --

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, then the prosecution team

   is unaware of any Government contact, but, again, the problem

   with that is to assure the Court and feel comfortable with my

   response, we would need to contact everyone to ask them the

   question.

            THE COURT:  Absent an additional showing, I'm in

   agreement with the response that it's not exculpatory.



                                                                           422



            MR. JONES:  Item 48 was withdrawn.

            Item 95 requested the Government identify terrorism

   experts that it had consulted who had proffered opinions

   concerning the involvement of others.  And by "others," we were

   referring to different -- to use the terminology we adopted

   earlier this morning -- involvement in the bombing and any

   reports related to those opinions.

            The Government's response was it had disclosed all

   statements of individuals interviewed in connection with the

   investigation and then said that an opinion by an expert in

   terrorism or counter-terrorism regarding other's possible

   involvement does not constitute Brady unless there is some

   evidence supporting that opinion, and then the Government said

   that any evidence that could support such an opinion had been

   and would continue to be disclosed to the defense.

            The problem I have with the response -- and again,

   perhaps it's just a semantic one -- is I read the response as

   saying, well, whatever the expert reviewed has been furnished

   to you, but that wasn't what I asked.  What I asked was for the

   identity of experts they had consulted who had given that

   opinion.  I got whatever facts they may have based the opinion

   upon, if, in fact, there were any experts, but I still think I

   am entitled to know who the experts were.  If there's an expert

   who reviewed this evidence and thought there were others

   involved, it seems to me that his identity is clearly



                                                                           423



   exculpatory.

            THE COURT:  Well, the way I read this response,

   though, is they are excluding what amounts to speculation

   without supporting factual information.

            MS. WILKINSON:  That's correct, your Honor.  We have

   not received any written opinion or what I'm aware of or -- the

   prosecution team is aware of, any opinion from expert that

   other individuals were involved.  But what we're trying to make

   sure of is if the director of the FBI consulted with another

   expert and someone gave him an opinion off the cuff on the

   first, second day after the bombing, surely, that would not

   fall under Brady.

            THE COURT:  Well, I'm in agreement to the extent that

   I think the opinion has to be something that amounts to an

   opinion that's supportable and not necessarily admissible in

   evidence, but which constitutes something more than speculation

   or conjecture without identifiers.

            MR. JONES:  I would agree with that, and we weren't

   seeking that.  But --

            THE COURT:  It's not clear that, you know, somebody

   could offer an opinion and say, well, I think that there are

   certain signature qualities to this explosion that suggests an

   identification with a similar explosion in another place and

   country.  I don't -- that, to my mind, is not sufficient

   opinion to be produced under Brady.  I hope that clears it up.



                                                                           424



   That's -- that's the basis for my -- essentially, my agreement

   with the Government's response.

            MR. JONES:  Item No. 112 was a list prepared by

   federal law enforcement authorities of men who fit the John Doe

   description and were known to have been associated with

   Mr. McVeigh.  The Government said basically in its response, We

   have also designated those 302's and inserts that may arguably

   contain exculpatory information regarding John Doe 2 and other

   suspects.  But it was the term "other suspects" -- if I may

   have just a moment, your Honor.  We will withdraw it, your

   Honor.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  136 said identification -- requested --

   I'm sorry.  136 requested identification of all sweeps of the

   Alfred P. Murrah Building for any bombs between April 15 and

   April 22, 1995.  The Government's response was --

            THE COURT:  April 5, not April 15.

            MR. JONES:  I'm sorry.  April 5.  Was that it was

   unaware of any credible evidence suggesting there were specific

   bomb threats to the Murrah Building during the period April 5

   through April 22.  They used the term "credible" several times

   in their response, and our argument is if they have any there,

   to give it to us and we determine the credibility of it.  They

   may have somebody they don't think is credible, but I think

   we're entitled to know the raw data.



                                                                           425



            THE COURT:  Well, the request was for any and all

   information concerning sweeps which I assume means some type of

   investigation for the presence of a bomb.

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.

            THE COURT:  And the answer to that says they have

   disclosed it and will disclose sweeps; then it goes on beyond

   that to talk about any evidence about bomb threats.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, the reason we did that was

   because the defense submitted a specification of materiality to

   justify this request so we were addressing --

            THE COURT:  -- both.

            MS. WILKINSON:  To the extent that they rely on a

   multiple bomb theory or specific bomb threats, although we have

   turned over the general bomb threats, we are not aware of any

   specific bomb threats to the Murrah Building during the time of

   April 5 to the 22nd.

            THE COURT:  So are you withdrawing the limitation of

   credible evidence?

            MS. WILKINSON:  In terms of the alleged sweeps, yes.

   Any information we have in reports or 302's or inserts or any

   alleged sweeps, someone who had said I think, you know, the

   bomb squad went into the building on the 10th, someone who

   doesn't have personal knowledge but they said that, we have

   turned that over.  I would call that -- it's questionable

   whether that's credible, but it's someone who has some reason



                                                                           426



   to believe it.  We've disclosed all that.  The point is if it's

   further relying on these other theories to justify --

            THE COURT:  No, the -- the way I interpret the issue

   here is whether there was, for example, an anonymous telephone

   threat, whether that's credible or not, you've provided it?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.  Any -- any threat to the Murrah

   Building during that time period has been disclosed.

            THE COURT:  Okay.  Then I think that removes the

   problem, doesn't it?

            MR. JONES:  It does.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. JONES:  Item 26, previous or ongoing investigation

   relevant to, 1, mitigation; 2, exculpation or; 3, impeachment,

   with respect to Mr. McVeigh has been resolved by the

   Government's response.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. JONES:  No. 56, psychological examination of

   witnesses is a duplication of an earlier one.  The Government

   will produce it if aware of it subject to the Court's

   scheduling order.  And the Government may have already produced

   it.  Will or have produced it.

            No. 80 modified, all notes regarding Michael and Lori

   Fortier's plea agreements, and that is one that there is strong

   contest over.  Do you wish us to address that now or come back

   when we've gone through the list?



                                                                           427



            THE COURT:  Let's come back to it.  That's No. --

            MR. JONES:  -- 80.

            THE COURT:  -- 80.

            MR. JONES:  No. 85, modified, request video or

   tape-recorded statements by Michael Fortier, television or

   otherwise.  That's been resolved by the Government's response.

            No. 89, information concerning general domestic

   sabotage and terrorism conspiracy.  The Government provided

   threat information on two letters relating to the Murrah

   Building.  As to others, overbroad; and while I think we may

   have some problems with the Government's response.  I really

   think that impacts on the matter discussed in chambers and

   should be reviewed again after the Court has entered the order.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  So if I could just describe that one as

   held in abeyance.

            No. 92, information concerning other federal buildings

   in, quote, Midwest, close quote, targeted or terrorism.  The

   Government's right.  We only repeated an allegation and did not

   request information.  We didn't complete it with a request.  We

   request that information.

            But again, I think perhaps that one should be held in

   abeyance.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. JONES:  No. 94, evidence of conspiracy --



                                                                           428



            THE COURT:  Excuse me.  That was 92; right?

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  No. 94 is modified, evidence of a

   conspiracy against any other federal building housing several

   law enforcement agencies.  The Government's response is it is

   overbroad except as to these defendants.  Government unaware of

   connection between other conspiracies and the Oklahoma bombing.

   We'll accept the Government's response resolves the matter.

            No. 96 is withdrawn.

            No. 97 is violent acts or threats of violent acts by

   domestic or right wing groups.  The Government's response is

   overbroad, but the Government unaware of any connection by

   these troops -- by these groups -- I'm sorry -- to Oklahoma

   bombing.  Resolved by the Government's response.

            103 is withdrawn.

            119, identification of unidentified Iranian informer

   has been resolved by the Government's response.

            No. 120 and 130, withdrawn.

            No. 131, production of the memorandum warning

   identified in the New Jersey Star Ledger.  The Government's

   response was it will submit in camera, and I don't know whether

   they have done that or not.  That is one that is still to be

   resolved.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, we need to discuss that, I



                                                                           429



   believe.  I, I think, disclosed the basic material that's in

   that threat; that it was specific to the conviction of the

   sheik in New York and the other -- his co-conspirators and that

   any information tending to indicate there was any threat said

   Washington, D.C. could be the -- would be the target.

            THE COURT:  Well, is this a marshal service

   communication that was sent to like chief judges?  Or is this

   something different?

            MS. WILKINSON:  It's addressed -- can I get my copy?

            THE COURT:  You may.  I don't think you've submitted

   it in camera.

            MS. WILKINSON:  No, I haven't.

            THE COURT:  Maybe we won't have to.

            MS. WILKINSON:  It is addressed to all the marshals

   across the country, your Honor, and it says at the bottom, This

   information should not be disclosed outside the marshal service

   and the court family.  I believe that's their normal warning

   where it goes down through the marshal's service to the chief

   judge.  Obviously, you're in a better position to know whether

   that's the procedure than I am, but --

            THE COURT:  Sometimes chief judges are in the court

   family.  I --

            MS. WILKINSON:  It's my understanding that's how it

   works and that, often, it is also disseminated to local law

   enforcement, as I said yesterday.



                                                                           430



            MR. JONES:  Well, your Honor, we asked for production

   of that under protective order to the defense.  That memorandum

   was sent out within 30 days before the Oklahoma City bombing.

   It describes a threat to federal property.  Talks about --

            THE COURT:  Well, why don't you go ahead with your

   plan to submit it to me and I'll decide it.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Sure.

            MR. JONES:  That's fair.

            No. 133, reports of immunities or leads regarding

   prior targets of federal buildings in the last two years.  The

   Government's response is overbroad again, but the information

   will be provided for Cary Gagan.  The defendants did not

   restrict its request to Gagan information.  So as I understand

   it, and -- well, perhaps I should let Ms. Wilkinson

   characterize their response.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, as I -- as the Government

   put forth in its brief, we have disclosed all the information

   regarding Mr. Gagan's allegations, but Mr. McVeigh's

   representatives have interviewed Mr. Gagan himself on August 2

   and August 3 -- this is true of many of these -- and had access

   to him and his allegations, but we're not withholding anything

   that we have regarding that information.

            THE COURT:  Is that right, that he has been

   interviewed by representatives of the defense team?

            MR. JONES:  Yes, we interviewed Mr. Gagan, but our



                                                                           431



   request was for any person in the last two years who had been

   given immunity as a result of furnishing leads concerning

   threatened or actual bombing of federal buildings and/or

   terrorism activities against the United States Government.  Our

   point being that if somebody was given immunity for it, that

   would indicate a serious probability of the credibility of the

   information.

            THE COURT:  I'll -- my ruling is that the request is

   overbroad, just as the Government has responded.

            MR. JONES:  No. 134, all information that a Government

   agency notified the Oklahoma City Fire Department of possible

   terrorist activity in Oklahoma City.  That, I believe, was

   resolved yesterday.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.

            MR. JONES:  The same request was in Rule 16.

            137, list of ATF employees absent from the Murrah

   Building on April 19, 1995, before 9:00 a.m.  The Government's

   response was it does not negate guilt or mitigation, but in a

   response the Government filed Friday, it addressed that issue.

            And the Government's response resolves the issue,

   although we dispute that the resident agent fell eight floors

   in the elevator.  We don't believe that's true.

            But that -- nevertheless, he was in the building which

   is what the request --

            THE COURT:  That's the only thing that's relevant.



                                                                           432



            MR. JONES:  139, evidence of prior warning referenced

   in the Oregonian -- that's been resolved by the Government's

   announcement of the submission for 131 and the two letters

   concerning threats which previously have been furnished.  The

   Government represents that's all it has.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Excuse me, your Honor, just to correct

   that.  To be clear, we have made those two disclosures of

   threats, but we continue to review our files and obviously, if

   we discover other threats or new information comes, we'll

   continue to disclose that.  I just wanted to make that clear

   that we're continuing with our obligations.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  One thing we do not have is a 302 of any

   interview with Judge Alley so I assume there wasn't one.

            THE COURT:  You don't have a 302?

            MR. JONES:  Correct.

            THE COURT:  Was --

            MR. JONES:  I don't know that he was interviewed.

            THE COURT:  Was the judge interviewed by an FBI agent

   and a 302 produced?

            MS. WILKINSON:  I don't know, your Honor.  I have to

   go back to the index.  I assume Mr. Jones has looked at the

   index, and if he says he didn't receive the --

            THE COURT:  This is all about something that appeared

   in a newspaper?



                                                                           433



            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, Judge.  What it is, it's the same

   story, I believe, as I told you this threat was -- the threat

   warning from the marshal service on March 15 was given to

   the -- the court family; and I believe after the bombing, Judge

   Alley made mention of the fact that he had received a general

   warning, you know, prior to the bombing.

            MR. JONES:  Well, I don't know that they are the same.

            THE COURT:  I see.  But I mean, this is generated by

   the fact that there was some -- something in this newspaper in

   Oregon?

            MR. JONES:  He was interviewed by the Oregonian on the

   day of the bombing.  He grew up in Oregon, and they called him

   because of the connection.

            THE COURT:  I see.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, could I ask if Mr. Jones

   has interviewed Judge Alley?

            THE COURT:  Do you want to answer that, Mr. Jones?

            MR. JONES:  Well, if you'll consult your index of

   people I've interviewed, no, I haven't interviewed Judge Alley.

   He's interviewed me on a few occasions.

            173 and 174 --

            THE COURT:  Well, have we left that open here?  I'm

   not sure what the resolution of this has been.  You don't have

   an interview report of anybody interviewing Judge Alley about

   this public statement?  Is that the response?



                                                                           434



            MS. WILKINSON:  I don't believe we do, your Honor, but

   I'd have to go back and check our index.  As I said, we're

   working from the same index that we provided to Mr. Jones.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm sure Judge Alley is

   equally available to the defense counsel as he is to the

   Government's counsel.

            MS. WILKINSON:  That was my point.

            THE COURT:  Yes.  Well, I'll make it explicitly for

   you.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Thank you.

            MR. JONES:  173 and 175, withdrawn.

            No. 51, all reports of investigative agencies and/or

   laboratory reports regarding the bombing of the Murrah Federal

   Building, I believe was resolved yesterday.

            No. 62 was a general Brady request, all other

   documents related to mitigation, exculpation or impeachment.

   The Government claimed it has satisfied the allegation, but our

   request is overbroad.  And I believe their response resolves it

   because it is a general Brady request with the limitations

   recognized in those requests.

            No. 177, any information related to notification that

   the Government gave to the miscellaneous law enforcement

   agencies with respect to information to be furnished to comply

   with Brady, Giglio and Rule 16.  What we were seeking for there

   is the production of the Government's letters to the national



                                                                           435



   security agencies and the other agencies.  It's my

   understanding they submitted the letter to the Court, and I --

            THE COURT:  Yeah.  There's a mistake in the response

   in that it refers to 1995.  It should be '96, I think.  And we

   discussed that in the in camera review of certain things, and

   I've commented with respect to my not reviewing that for

   purposes of saying good or bad.  But the rest of the response?

            MR. JONES:  Well, our position is that in view of the

   Court's announcement that it was not ruling or giving an

   opinion on whether the request was satisfactory -- was

   satisfied -- satisfactory or unsatisfactory, then we ask that a

   copy of the letter be furnished to us under the protective

   order so that if it isn't, in our opinion, we can brief the

   issue with the Court.

            THE COURT:  Well, I'm going to deny that request.  My

   position is, as I've stated it before -- and that is that this

   is the responsibility of counsel for the Government to make the

   necessary inquiries and to make the response, and I'm not going

   to monitor it.

            MR. JONES:  Item No. 22, information that Roger Moore

   was not actually robbed.  The Government's response says it has

   no credible information.  They have furnished us certain

   information that would support the theory advanced in No. 22,

   but again, I'm concerned about the adjective "credible."  We

   asked for all information, not just that which they consider to



                                                                           436



   be credible information that he wasn't robbed.  Now, maybe they

   have given us everything.

            THE COURT:  Well, in the discovery material yesterday,

   you're going to provide two things there, I thought.  One is

   whether he was, quote, an informer and another is whether

   there's information about what was taken.

            MS. WILKINSON:  We will provide a list of what we -- I

   think that goes to the overt acts we discussed, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  I know, but it provides more information

   about this same subject.  And I think that, you know, you --

   the credible information again is something where it's your

   evaluation of whether this is sufficiently supportable to be

   material to the defense.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I think we've done both, your Honor.

   We have turned over all information we have on the Roger Moore

   robbery.

            THE COURT:  Credible or not.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.  In fact, I think there was a

   comment in Mr. McVeigh's brief that stated that we had sought

   some other records and that somehow suggested that we didn't

   think that Mr. Moore was robbed.  In fact, it was to

   corroborate the robbery.  But all those records have been

   disclosed to the defense, and we will also honor our promise of

   yesterday to turn over a list of all items that were stolen.

            THE COURT:  That's going to be true of the next item



                                                                           437



   here?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Correct.

            MR. JONES:  Yes.  That was resolved yesterday.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  24, 28, 32, have been withdrawn.

            35, any evidence Michael Fortier used the alias of

   Jimmy Foley.  If I might have just a moment, your Honor?

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, in our copy, part of the

   Government's response was cut off and I can't read it.  Would

   you mind filling that in, what the response was?

            MS. WILKINSON:  We say the Government has disclosed

   and will disclose all material information pertaining to

   Michael Fortier, including information about names used at gun

   shows he attended and elsewhere.

            We are aware from a defense interview -- from defense

   interview statements that Jimmy Foley was a high school

   classmate of Michael Fortier's.  We learned that from reading

   their reports that they provided to us, your Honor.

            MR. JONES:  Well, it doesn't mean he didn't use the

   alias.  I don't think it's responsive to the request.  They --

   I mean, do they have evidence that he used the alias or not?

            MS. WILKINSON:  I don't believe that we do, but we

   have disclosed all information pertaining to Michael Fortier,

   and obviously using an alias would be relevant or impeachment



                                                                           438



   material.

            THE COURT:  So the answer is you don't have any

   information that he used an alias of that -- that alias?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Correct.  I believe the statement that

   Mr. Jones disclosed to us, it was someone who said they had

   heard that.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.  This doesn't exclude the

   possibility he did, but you don't have the information.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Correct.

            THE COURT:  That's your response, as I understand it.

            MS. WILKINSON:  You understand it correctly.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  No. 87, any information concerning the

   1982 and 1987, '88, Alfred P. Murrah Building conspiracies.

   That's dealing with a so-called bombing conspiracy or any

   allegations that James Nichols was conspiring against the

   Alfred P. Murrah Building.  I believe that the Government's

   response that they have given us everything that may relate to

   Mr. James Nichols has resolved it.

            But with respect to the 1982 matter, or '83 matter, if

   the Court will recall, that arose because there was testimony,

   as I understand it, from two witnesses at the Fort Smith

   sedition trial that Richard Snell, along with James Ellison,

   who presently lives at Elohim City, were going to have a rocket

   attack either on the Murrah Building or an office building



                                                                           439



   in -- federal office building in Dallas, Texas.

            The Government's response was to give us a 302 of an

   interview with an assistant United States attorney who

   prosecuted the Fort Smith sedition case and interviewed

   Mr. Ellison, and so we have a 302 of the prosecutor who put

   Mr. Ellison on the witness stand in 1982.

            My question, though, is, there surely is other

   information the Government has because they introduced this

   evidence at the Fort Smith sedition trial, so there must have

   been 302's and grand jury testimony and perhaps even exhibits

   used at the Fort Smith sedition trial to prove that point

   because it was one of the points the Government introduced

   testimony on and we don't have any way to get those Department

   of Justice files.  We can't get 302's of witnesses that

   testified at Fort Smith or exhibits that the Government may

   have used or grand jury testimony in the Fort Smith sedition

   trial.

            THE COURT:  Well, there's a trial record, I presume.

            MS. WILKINSON:  We provided the transcript, your

   Honor, of his testimony in addition to the 302 from the -- the

   assis --

            THE COURT:  The result of that trial was a verdict of

   acquittal, wasn't it?

            MS. WILKINSON:  That's correct.

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.



                                                                           440



            THE COURT:  Well, I -- you know, do you have the

   transcripts of the trial testimony?  It seems to me --

            MR. JONES:  I don't know that we do.  I wasn't aware

   that we do.  Do we have the transcripts?

            MS. WILKINSON:  I believe we provided the transcript.

            MR. JONES:  Is that a 1A?

            THE COURT:  Double check that.  The trial transcripts,

   it seems to me --

            MS. WILKINSON:  It's public record.

            THE COURT:  -- that would be the most pertinent

   information.

            MR. JONES:  If we have them, that should resolve it

   then.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  If not, we'll try to resolve it.

            No. 88, that's a Roger Moore matter, and I think that

   was resolved yesterday.

            No. 104, reports of a dark pickup truck carrying

   suspects.  That was resolved by the Government's response.

            105, reports of a white Oldsmobile or Thunderbird

   which may be a suspected vehicle related to the Alfred P.

   Murrah Federal Building.  Resolved by response.

            No. 121, withdrawn.

            No. 138, I'd like to hold in abeyance for a moment.

            No. 140, any evidence of Arizona license plate LVC646



                                                                           441



   sighted on a vehicle in Oklahoma City.  It's resolved by the

   Government's response.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, we interpreted that

   request to have the license plate properly designated.

            I don't think that's the right number, Mr. Jones, just

   for your information, but we -- I think you have the numbers

   transposed.

            MR. JONES:  All right.  Thank you.

            No. 141 apparently has been resolved by the

   Government's response.

            No. 158 is withdrawn.

            No. 160 is withdrawn.

            161, training devices and inert explosives in the

   Alfred P. Murrah Building was resolved yesterday.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I would like to clarify

   one thing I said yesterday.  I didn't -- I wasn't totally

   informed.  When we were discussing bulk explosives in the

   laboratory and I discussed the chance that a live device could

   be brought into the laboratory, the experts informed me that I

   was wrong, that they would never bring a live device in, that

   they would render it safe at the site -- which makes sense when

   you think about it.  But they would render a device safe and

   take the explosives out and take a sample to send back to the

   lab.  So they don't keep any bulk explosives in the laboratory

   ever.  I think I said yesterday a device may be in evidence and



                                                                           442



   I was wrong.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  No. 25, logs of surveillance of any

   co-conspirators on or before April 19, 1995, has been resolved

   by the Government's response.

            No. 159 and 166 are withdrawn.

            No. 33 is withdrawn.

            No. 36, Jack Alpen statements, resolved by response.

            No. 55, polygraphs and related information, addressed

   and resolved yesterday.

            No. 71, records from the Council Grove storage shed,

   resolved yesterday and by the response.

            No. 73, withdrawn.

            No. 84, any inconsistent statements by Michael or Lori

   Fortier including grand jury testimony.  We have their grand

   jury testimony, but I would like to hold the rest of this and

   come back to the question about the proffer conversations which

   the Court earlier said we could address at the heel of this.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  113, 114, 126, 128, 142, 143, withdrawn.

            145, Inspector General or Government Accounting Office

   investigation of laboratory standards at the FBI lab.  Resolved

   by the Court yesterday.

            149, withdrawn.

            150, withdrawn.



                                                                           443



            86, I don't -- I agree with them.  Mr. Fortier's

   presentencing statements would be in the hands of the probation

   office which is not a branch of the Department of Justice

   unless, of course, the FBI or the Department of Justice got a

   copy of his statement to the probation office, which I

   understand is the usual practice, that if a defendant makes --

            THE COURT:  Well, the control of that information is

   under the authority of the sentencing court, and I think you

   should petition the sentencing court for it.

            THE COURT:

            MR. JONES:  I agree, your Honor, but it's my

   understanding that whatever Mr. Fortier told his probation

   officer, a copy routinely is sent to the Department of Justice

   to comment on it or to the Bureau of Prisons.  But especially

   the Department of Justice.  If I take a client in and he makes

   a statement to the probation office, they routinely send a copy

   of it to the U.S. Attorney to comment on it.  And so therefore,

   if -- if the --

            THE COURT:  Well, in this district, the prosecution

   gets to review the copy.  They don't get to keep it.

            MR. JONES:  Not of the -- all right.

            THE COURT:  They get to review the whole report and

   then comment on it at sentencing hearing or under the procedure

   make objections to it in advance, but they don't get to retain

   a report.



                                                                           444



            MR. JONES:  We'll -- we'll address it to the district

   court.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.  I think that ought to go to the

   sentencing court.  That's the appropriate authority to release

   the information.

            MR. JONES:  118 is withdrawn.

            41, the Ryder truck measurements in comparison to

   Regency Tower video is probably resolved by the Government's

   response, your Honor.  We'll check it.

            No. 63, military records of Mr. McVeigh, Mr. Fortier

   and Mr. Nichols, resolved by the response.

            No. 70, inventory of Boots U-Store-It, resolved by the

   response.

            No. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, withdrawn.

            No. 1, statement of David Irving of the U.S.

   embassies, may we place that at the heel?  That is one that's

   contested.  May we come back to that, your Honor?

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MR. JONES:  2 and 3 are withdrawn.

            4, this would be in the matters that we discussed in

   chambers and would be addressed by the Court's order.

            THE COURT:  To be forthcoming.

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, just to be clear, this is

   not contained in that classified information request.  So we'd



                                                                           445



   have to -- the Court should consider this in addition to that

   motion.

            THE COURT:  Well --

            MS. WILKINSON:  As part of the motion.  Because I

   don't believe this exact request is repeated.  In fact, I know

   it's not in the -- in defendant McVeigh's classified

   information request.

            THE COURT:  Let me review it again.  What -- what

   number are you talking about?

            MS. WILKINSON:  No. 4 and it's got A through N

   subparts.  It lists a variety of terrorist acts.

            MR. WYATT:  Your Honor, that's at page 36 through 38.

            MS. WILKINSON:  But for some reason, it wasn't listed

   in the narrowed --

            THE COURT:  Well, it comes in that same category, so

   we'll look at it.  Number -- well, wait a minute.  I get

   confused with the response number and the request number.

            MS. WILKINSON:  What we tried to do, your Honor, was

   number our responses sequentially so you could go back to them.

            THE COURT:  So it's their No. 4 on page 36, which has

   parts that go over to 37 and your response is number 65.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Correct.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.  All right.  We got it.  We'll

   consider that then in the same category.

            MR. JONES:  5, 6, 7, 9, 10 -- I'm sorry.  Strike 10.



                                                                           446



   And 11.  Well, strike 11.  That's been provided.  So 5, 6, 7,

   and 9 are still pending, but the Government's response on No. 9

   is that these individuals were not investigated as suspects or

   witnesses.

            And 8 has been withdrawn.

            Number 10, I think we should address today, although

   after addressing it, the Court may want to put it as part of

   the other matter.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, could we go through these

   one at a time?  I'm having a hard time following Mr. Jones just

   on these few.

            No. 6, are we including that in the classified

   information category?

            MR. JONES:  Yes.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Okay.

            MR. JONES:  5, 6, 7 in the classified information

   category.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I'm not sure, your Honor, why No. 5

   would fall under the classified information category.  Just

   because the individuals have Middle Eastern ancestry or

   nationality --

            MR. JONES:  I'll withdraw 5.  I agree with you.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.  6 and 7 do relate, although you

   made a response to 7.

            MS. WILKINSON:  We could not always discern why the



                                                                           447



   defense put certain requests in the classified information

   brief and why in the exculpatory, but we understood the Court

   to have requested us to answer each request, and this one had

   not been put into the classified information request.  As we

   said, we're not aware of any warnings.

            THE COURT:  But again, there's a qualifier in there.

   "Credible."

            MR. JONES:  That's my concern because we have

   submitted to the Court --

            THE COURT:  It really does go into the classified

   information matter, I think.  Should be addressed there.  And

   then 9, also?

            MR. JONES:  Yes.

            THE COURT:  Is that right?  9?

            MR. JONES:  Yes.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I'm not sure why these two

   individuals again fall under classified information.  Just

   because their names are of foreign descent, I don't think that

   qualifies them.

            THE COURT:  No.  But the source of the information

   with respect to them might be one of the sources that's being

   -- I'm being asked to structure an order related to the

   approach to that source?

            MS. WILKINSON:  It could, but from their request, it's

   impossible to discern that; and it seems to me that for these



                                                                           448



   two individuals, I mean, we have thousands of individuals who

   have been in --

            THE COURT:  Let me ask you this:  Is your answer to

   response No. 69 inclusive of all of the agencies who might know

   this, have this --

            MS. WILKINSON:  You mean if any agency has ever

   investigated this?  Of course not.  We didn't know these names

   beforehand so we've never asked other agencies whether they

   have investigated --

            THE COURT:  That's what I interpreted your response to

   mean.  You don't know who they are.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, the first one is the

   co-defendant to Ramzi Yousef.  I mean, he's named in the

   indictment and I believe was convicted and the second one, over

   my index here -- I'll notify Ms. Wilkinson.

            THE COURT:  Who they are.  Further identification is

   requested by you; is that right?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, your Honor.

            MR. JONES:  That's reasonable.  No. 10 is, strictly

   speaking, not a CIPA matter, but -- it could be that the Court

   wants to address it there and not address it today.  That was

   the one for application of --

            THE COURT:  Yeah.  Isn't that -- I don't have ready

   familiarity with that act.  Isn't that act those applications

   are made to a special court?



                                                                           449



            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.  To FISA court, your Honor,

   but --

            THE COURT:  And I don't know what the -- that court

   does with respect to the secrecy of those records.

            MS. WILKINSON:  The Government maintains copies of

   those applications, just as we would in a Title 3 wiretap.

            THE COURT:  But are you free to disclose them?

            MS. WILKINSON:  It depends on the nature of the

   criminal proceeding and the relation between the FISA wiretap

   and the criminal proceeding here.  Under Alderman, we've

   already reported that no wiretaps, whether they fall under FISA

   or Title 3, were conducted on these defendants; and we

   understand that to be the -- you know, the extent of -- that we

   have to respond in this case.  That's what we're objecting to,

   revealing whether we had --

            THE COURT:  Okay.  So the Department of Justice has

   records of any such applications having been made to that

   court?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Correct.

            THE COURT:  And there aren't any.

            MS. WILKINSON:  As to these defendants, that's

   correct.

            MR. JONES:  Well, that's my point and I agree with her

   that, generally, we would get the information or should get the

   information if applications were made concerning our clients,



                                                                           450



   but if applications were made to FISA for individuals other

   than these defendants for wiretaps, I think that's a -- meets

   the low threshold showing that there could be different

   suspects or perpetrators.

            THE COURT:  Again, I'm not familiar with what that

   statute requires as compared with Title 3 that we use, but if

   it's anywhere similar, then there has to be a justification

   shown; and it seems to me that the appropriate inquiry here is

   whether the application shows as justification the

   investigation of threats against this building.

            MR. JONES:  That was exactly my point.  If -- if

   the -- the Government made an application for a wiretap order

   against someone else other than these defendants and cited as

   support that wiretap order, the probable cause showing to get

   it, I think that clearly is material to the defense here.

            THE COURT:  If the probable cause relates to this

   event.

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.

            THE COURT:  As compared to just --

            MR. JONES:  Yes.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.  That isn't the way I read the

   request.

            MR. JONES:  I'm sorry.  That's the way we meant it.

   And the Government has never responded that there were no FISA

   applications with respect to this case.  They simply say there



                                                                           451



   are none with respect to these defendants, but if they made one

   concerning other suspects and mentioned this case, then we want

   to know those.

            THE COURT:  Yes.  What about that?  Have you checked

   that?

            MS. WILKINSON:  I'm unaware of that, your Honor.  But

   we will go back and double-check that.  I don't believe there

   were any --

            THE COURT:  I think they are entitled to know the

   answer to that.

            MS. WILKINSON:  So in other words, if the basis of the

   probable cause was that some -- I know the standard is an agent

   of a foreign power, it's different obviously than a Title 3,

   but the same general probable cause is necessary.  If that

   individual were involved with some kind of plan or threat or

   plot to bomb the Murrah Building, obviously, that would be --

            THE COURT:  -- the subject of requiring this

   technique --

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes.  I --

            THE COURT:  -- related to this event.  Yes.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I'm sure that does not exist because

   we would be aware of the underlying information, but we will

   double-check.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  12, 13, 14, 15, withdrawn.



                                                                           452



            16.

            MS. WILKINSON:  I'm sorry.  What happened to No. 11?

            MR. JONES:  Resolved by your response.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Okay.

            MR. JONES:  If I might have just a moment, your Honor.

   This is matters relating to Mr. Strassmeir and I assume should

   be addressed as part of CIPA, although his Immigration Service

   file, I believe, is a 1A item -- I assume any items listed on

   the 1A index concerning him, we can get copies of.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Of course.  Those have always been

   available to the defense.

            MR. JONES:  The rest of it, I suggest be held in

   abeyance pending the Court's order on CIPA.

            THE COURT:  No. 16?

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, just to be clear, we have

   already disclosed materials regarding Mr. Strassmeir,

   interviews.

            THE COURT:  Quite a few of them.

            MS. WILKINSON:  And Mr. Jones has disclosed an

   interview to us that he had.

            MR. JONES:  No. 17, the Court -- or the Government's

   response, it is overbroad, speculative, and beyond the scope of

   Brady.  They say, however, they have and will continue to give

   us all information pertaining to Richard Snell; and if I may



                                                                           453



   inquire, would that include information concerning plans,

   plots, conspiracies or whatever with respect to his execution

   and protest or efforts to avoid it?

            MS. WILKINSON:  No.  Only -- the documents we've

   disclosed on Richard Snell are only to the extent we've

   collected them in connection with this investigation.

            THE COURT:  I've seen them.  You supplied them in the

   appendix.

            MS. WILKINSON:  People who make allegations, we go out

   and check them out, write a 302 and then disclose it to the

   defense.  But in terms of his general involvement or alleged

   involvement in solicitation or encouragement or attempts to

   mark his execution or others in that by violent acts, we have

   not gone out and done an investigation of that general nature,

   and we think that's beyond the scope of Brady.

            THE COURT:  I agree.

            MR. JONES:  18 is withdrawn.

            19 concerning Department of Justice phone call 24

   minutes before the bombing.  Government claims to have

   disclosed the Tolson logbook, which I -- was in the most recent

   discovery.  I don't think we have it yet.

            THE COURT:  Where does this quotation come from?  From

   302's?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, your Honor.

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.



                                                                           454



            THE COURT:  And you've disclosed what you have?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Relative to that.  That's where

   Mr. Jones got it from, is us, from our investigation.

            THE COURT:  Your response is those 302's.  And what is

   that D?  Is that an insert?  D13814?

            MR. WYATT:  Those are 302's, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  I'm sorry.

            MS. WILKINSON:  That's the way the defense writes it.

   We usually just write the 302 with the serial number.  They

   have the D in front of it.

            THE COURT:  That's what you have.

            MS. WILKINSON:  That's what we have.  And any further

   investigation we do, we'll disclose.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. JONES:  Well, the reason I put it on here is that

   I wrote Mr. Hartzler a couple months ago and asked if we could

   interview these agents and he said yes, that he wanted to check

   into it first, and we haven't heard back from him.  So although

   they now have produced the Tolson logbook -- so I don't mean to

   pressure him, press him about it today, but it is still a

   matter outstanding.

            THE COURT:  Well, I don't think, though, that the

   question of interviewing them is the subject of ruling on this

   present motion.

            MR. JONES:  I agree.



                                                                           455



            THE COURT:  All right.  No. 20.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, so as to 19, are we

   resolved, Mr. Jones?  Is it resolved?

            MR. JONES:  I still want to interview them --

            THE COURT:  The motion is resolved.

            MR. JONES:  Right.  The motion is resolved.  Yes.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MS. WILKINSON:  As to exculpatory evidence that we're

   disclosing.

            THE COURT:  This motion is resolved with respect to

   Item 19.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Thank you.

            MR. JONES:  No. 20, any information that federal or

   state law enforcement authorities had suspicion or knowledge of

   a violent terrorist attack to occur in Oklahoma City around

   April 19.  The Government has responded that they have given us

   the two letters and they provided the Star Ledger memo or will

   provide it for in camera review by the Court.  Our problem is

   that we have information that the FTS operators in the Murrah

   Building were specifically warned to be on the lookout for a

   possible threat.  And there's no reference here as to whether

   they have contacted the FTS operators with respect to that

   matter.  And that's our information.  It may be wrong, but we

   have it from a credible source.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, this is the first time



                                                                           456



   we're hearing this that I recall.  Perhaps Mr. Jones has

   written us a letter about it.  I don't recall it.  However --

            THE COURT:  Well, is that what the request --

            MS. WILKINSON:  No.

            MR. JONES:  No.  I think in the specifications or

   elsewhere, we have specifically mentioned the FTS, but I'll

   write them a letter to be sure about it.

            MS. WILKINSON:  But, your Honor, we've disclosed

   anything we have checked in our investigation about threats.

   We are unaware of any threats that -- to Oklahoma City or to

   the Federal Building during that time period, any specific

   threats.  As I said, I believe this is probably related to the

   March warning that went out across the country for everyone to

   heighten their security, and that makes sense that everyone

   would be alerted.

            THE COURT:  Well, I think the question, though, is in

   answering that, does that include a check of these FTS

   operators?

            MR. JONES:  It was --

            MS. WILKINSON:  I don't know what the FTS operators

   are, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  They are the people who handle the long

   distance, among other things, the telephone lines for the

   building.

            MS. WILKINSON:  You're talking about the federal



                                                                           457



   Government operators for FTS?  I thought FTS was a federal line

   that we used to make calls among the agencies.

            THE COURT:  Yeah.  But you can contact operators to

   assist in calling.  At least you used to be able to.  I don't

   use the phone that much anymore.

            MR. WYATT:  I believe the FTS is a division of GSA,

   and we're specifically referencing e-mail that went over the

   wires in the days immediately preceding the bombing.

            THE COURT:  I don't know that e-mail goes FTS.  I

   don't think it does.  I think FTS is strictly telephone.

            MR. JONES:  This was a distribution to them and

   specifically the --

            THE COURT:  Well, you better make your request more

   specific.

            MR. JONES:  All right.  No. 21 has been resolved by

   the Government's response that they don't know who Mr. Robinson

   is.

            1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are general Brady requests,

   your Honor, and the Government has responded accordingly.

            And that completes this review and leaves --

            MS. WILKINSON:  On page 19, No. 80 was the first one

   we left, I believe, unresolved; is that right?

            THE COURT:  No. 80.  I -- I don't know that we'll get

   these resolved in the next 10 or 15 minutes.  We still have

   these items that will warrant some discussion, I take it, and



                                                                           458



   we have the identification motion that we agreed we could hear

   tomorrow.  And we have the additional conference to do.  So

   maybe the best thing -- I was discussing it in the nonpublic

   meeting, timing with that.  Maybe the thing to do is come back

   to this at 9:00 and also the identification issue and get those

   things done and then retire to the conference.  How's that?

            Mr. Woods.

            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may it please the Court.  We

   had that one pending motion asking for a list of attendees at

   the Oklahoma City meeting.

            THE COURT:  Yes.  We'll address that, too.

            MR. WOODS:  Thank you.

            THE COURT:  You'll be prepared to address that or

   whoever.

            MS. WILKINSON:  We will, your Honor, yes.

            THE COURT:  Okay.  We'll do those things at the 9:00

   incoming.  And then whenever those things are done, we'll -- I

   don't want to say retreat.  We will discuss scheduling and see

   where we are.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, we advised the Court yesterday

   that we had a status report which addressed some of the matters

   we discussed in chambers.  Attached to the status report were

   some charts that I believe Ms. Wilkinson had an objection to,

   and so I would like to ask to file this, but ask that it be

   filed under seal until the Court can decide if the charge



                                                                           459



   should be removed.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I believe since it's a

   discovery request -- I mean, it's -- it deals with discovery

   matters, we've been putting those other things under seal.  But

   if the Court wants to take it under advisement and then have us

   address it, we can do that.

            THE COURT:  Well, does the status report include

   editorializing in addition to factual information?

            MR. JONES:  No.  It arose this way:  Yesterday, we had

   the charts and the Court -- the Court got before it at -- at

   the Court's request, I handed the Court the charts, but the

   Court had them, but they are not in the record anyplace.  And

   so I was just trying to put a place -- to put them in the

   record to complete the record, but I'm not necessarily

   suggesting they are public.  I mean, some of this material, I

   think, is public, but I understand the concern about --

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, it has correspondence,

   discovery correspondence between the parties.

            THE COURT:  That comes under the nonpublic criteria.

            MS. WILKINSON:  And the brief, itself, the status

   report does have -- as you might imagine, we disagree on the

   characterization -- does have some editorializing, so we would

   request that it be placed under seal.

            MR. JONES:  I request it be placed under seal.



                                                                           460



            THE COURT:  You said part of it.

            MR. JONES:  I'm sorry.  Well, the status report is no

   different than three or four others that have been filed that

   analyze the delay.

            THE COURT:  File it sealed and we'll decide what needs

   to be opened.

            MR. JONES:  All right.

            THE COURT:  We don't need blowups, though, anyway,

   because demonstrative exhibits are not necessary for these

   proceedings.  So I'll see you at 9:00 in the morning.

            Court's in recess.

<P> In this three-day hearing, lawyers argued over what evidence the prosecution must turn over to the defense. Prosecutors are obliged to provide the defendants any evidence they consider using in a trial as well as any information that might help the defense side. Defendant Timothy McVeigh's attorney, Stephen Jones, asked for details on negotiations between authorities and Michael Fortier, a former associate of McVeigh's who is expected to testify for the government in exchange for a plea agreement. Jones contended that Fortier changed his story as part of deal to avoid trial.</P>

                             PROCEEDINGS

       (In open court at 9:58 a.m.)

            THE COURT:  We are again resumed in 96-CR-68.  It

   would appear that the appearances are the same.

            MR. HARTZLER:  Right, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  And the start of our hearing was delayed

   past the 9 o'clock established time because counsel asked for



                                                                           463



   and I granted the opportunity for them to meet together and

   without me to have free discussion with respect to attempting

   to resolve any of the issues that could be resolved in that

   fashion.  So we're now ready to proceed.

            As we recessed yesterday afternoon, we had gone

   through item by item the matters requested in the motion for

   production filed August 30 as docket entry 1939.  In the course

   of that, several items were reserved for hearing and

   disposition.  So I suggest we take those items up now.

            Mr. Jones.

            MR. JONES:  Thank you, your Honor.

            May it please the Court, I believe that I have

   previously described or characterized the issue of the FBI

   laboratory in terms of our modern culture as being the

   potential Detective Mark Furman issue of this case.  But with

   respect to the Brady motion and particularly the five items

   that are remaining, I think that those can be characterized

   slightly different, and that this relates primarily and most

   importantly, Request No. 80 and 84, to one of those legs that I

   talked about on the first day, and that specifically is the

   testimony to be offered at sometime in the trial of Michael and

   Lori Fortier.

            The requests that are still pending is Request No. 80

   and 84.  And if I may, I'll just read it into the record.  We

   requested any and all notes, reports, minutes, and/or



                                                                           464



   transcripts of the negotiating sessions by and between Michael

   Fortier and his lawyers and Lori Fortier and her lawyers and

   representatives of the United States Government which contain

   language or details of the proffer either by Michael or Lori

   Fortier or the alleged details of factual representations

   together where a copy of immunity agreement or immunity

   extensions or agreements to prosecute or plea bargains extended

   to either Michael or Lori Fortier.

            Request No. 84 requested all prior inconsistent

   statements of Michael Fortier and Lori Fortier together with

   all statements of Michael Fortier and Lori Fortier given to the

   grand jury, the United States Attorney's Office or its

   representative, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the ATF,

   or any other law enforcement, additionally we requested 302s,

   reports, summaries, notes, memoranda, and all statements that

   intend to inculpate Michael and Lori Fortier.

            Now, the Government has given to us pursuant to a

   Court's order the grand jury testimony of both Michael and Lori

   Fortier.  I believe the Government's representation in the

   materials submitted to us is that both of them appeared before

   the grand jury only once, and I believe those dates were

   immediately prior to the return of the indictment, perhaps

   August 9, August 10 of last year.

            In addition, we received in January of this year

   copies of 302's of Michael and Lori Fortier, and we may have



                                                                           465



   received one or two since then.  So it appears, your Honor,

   that we have received the 302's and we have received the grand

   jury testimony.  But there is a gap beginning at sometime

   unknown to us but presumably in May or June, because our

   information comes basically from a very informative article

   that appeared in USA Today written by Kevin Johnson, a copy of

   which was attached to the motion to begin with.

            This article took up approximately a third of a page

   and purports to detail discussions of the negotiating sessions.

   We don't know what happened in those sessions, but we can

   certainly surmise because the last of the 302's and the

   beginning of the grand jury testimony show that during that

   period of time, the story changed considerably.  And we end

   with the last information given on the 302, and then we get the

   grand jury material.

            Well, what happened between the last of the 302's and

   the grand jury material is they reached an agreement.  And

   under the rules, undoubtedly that proceeded with a proffer.

   And what we believe happened is that because this took so long,

   it took a period of many weeks in which joint sessions were

   held with attorney for both of these individuals, that proffers

   were made of what the testimony could do and what we had was a

   give and take.  So in other words, the original proffer of what

   Michael Fortier knew and would testify to increased and got,

   quote, better, close quote, for the Government as the



                                                                           466



   Government's negotiations and his perception of what was his

   best interest also got better.  And the reason we know that is

   because, first of all, human experience teaches us that, but

   secondly because of the long period of time over which these

   negotiations and meetings took place.

            So Mr. Hartzler and his staff met with Mr. McGuire on

   behalf of Mr. Fortier and Mr. Martin on behalf of Mrs. Fortier,

   and they engaged in some horse trading.  And all we have is the

   final product.  And what we want are the statements that were

   made because we don't believe that either Mr. Fortier or

   Mr. McGuire, his agent, came in and on the first day told the

   Government what's in that grand jury testimony.  What we think

   happened is the story changed and got better for the

   Government's standpoint.

            Now, we are dealing with people, at least in Fortier's

   case, who made at least a dozen statements to national

   television networks and to national newspapers concerning his

   lack of involvement, the lack of involvement of Mr. McVeigh,

   and some of those statements are preceded with the word

   honestly, meaning an honest representation of what he was

   telling his interlocutors was true.  He's come 180 degrees now,

   implicating not only himself, but his wife and making

   incriminating statements concerning our client which the

   Government will represent to the jury are truthful.

            In addition to that, the Government has disclosed



                                                                           467



   exculpatory information concerning him that would detract from

   his credibility in front of a jury aside from the statements

   that were already in the public domain.  So we asked the

   Government for that, and we were told that any exculpatory

   information contained in the attorney notes would be provided

   to us.  And we got back a letter related to an alleged drug use

   by the Fortiers.

            But that's not really central to the issue here of

   during these negotiating sessions, how much did Michael

   Fortier's statement evolve and did he change or withdraw those

   statements.  There are no 302's of any of those meetings.  It's

   my understanding there were always FBI agents present, but they

   had writer's cramp and they didn't make any notes of those

   meetings, and we don't have Mr. Hartzler's notes.

            Now, there may be some exception to the production of

   attorney notes in the interview and preparation of a witness

   for trial.  We understand that, that's attorney work product.

   But this is a different type of meeting.  This was a meeting to

   elicit information from a potential defendant in order to

   determine how the Government would respond to a suggested plea

   bargain.  And we simply want to know what he said during those

   sessions because we believe it highly material and highly

   exculpatory.

            THE COURT:  What he said, meaning Mr. Fortier.

            MR. JONES:  Or his agent on his behalf.



                                                                           468



            THE COURT:  Well, there's a big difference, big

   difference.

            MR. JONES:  Well, I understand and appreciate that the

   Court recognizes that difference.  But in terms of this case, I

   wonder if it isn't a distinction without a difference.  If

   Mr. McGuire goes in and makes a proffer and says this is what

   my client would say, there's no attorney/client privilege

   because he's repeating it to others.  There's no attorney work

   product privilege because he's repeating it to others.  And if

   for example he said to them, All my client can tell you is that

   Tim McVeigh once told him X, but if two weeks later he comes in

   and says, My client can tell you that Tim McVeigh said X and Y

   and did A and B, that is a material difference, and

   inconsistency, if you will, from the earlier statement.  And

   that is what we are asking to be produced.

            And I think the dispute we have with the Government

   has been narrowed to the issue, 'cause I think they produced

   everything else, to what transpired in those negotiating

   sessions.  And I'm not asking for what the Government said.

   I'm only asking for what Mr. Fortier and his wife said or was

   said on their behalf with their authorization.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Ms. Wilkinson, do you have any

   response?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, to get right to the point,

   Mr. Jones has Mr. Fortier's statement.  He said himself that he



                                                                           469



   saw Mr. Fortier on television saying one thing and that he read

   the grand jury that was provided and that the statements were

   materially different.  Therefore he has been provided and he

   can use that information to cross-examine Mr. Fortier about how

   he started out saying he was not involved and what he stated to

   the grand jury.

            THE COURT:  Mr. Jones has made an assumption that in

   the course of the negotiations discussion there was a proffer

   and either a proffer made orally and notes taken of it or a

   written proffer made which, you know, I'm not a party to such

   negotiations in any case, no judge is, but is it the fact that

   there was a written proffer at some time?

            MS. WILKINSON:  There was never a written proffer,

   your Honor.

            THE COURT:  Okay.  And so --

            MS. WILKINSON:  And there was no horse trading, as

   Mr. Jones characterized it.  Mr. Fortier's attorney -- perhaps

   I should turn this over to Mr. Hartzler.  I would feel more

   comfortable with him representing exactly what happened.

            THE COURT:  All right, Mr. Hartzler, if you wish to.

            MR. HARTZLER:  What happened was the attorneys came in

   and made a proffer to Government attorneys, the attorneys for

   the Fortiers.

            THE COURT:  An oral proffer.

            MR. HARTZLER:  An oral proffer that I did not witness



                                                                           470



   but was advised that they identified highlights, which of

   course I won't go into here today, highlights of what the

   witnesses could testify to.  Those highlights are revealed in

   the grand jury testimony.  After that initial proffer was made,

   I then took over and met separately with the Fortiers and their

   attorneys with agents and other Government attorneys present,

   and we asked for additional details about those highlights.

   For the most part, those additional details are disclosed in

   the grand jury testimony.

            Horse trading is an unfair characterization of what

   went on.  We listened to what the Fortiers could testify to

   under a proffer agreement which has been disclosed.  They

   provided us with information consistent with what they said in

   the grand jury.

            At the conclusion of our receiving the details from

   them, we told them what information, we told them what plea

   agreement we would except from Michael Fortier, presented that.

   It was accepted.  There was no dickering back and forth.  There

   was certainly no negotiating for additional information or

   additional facts.  And I think that the information that's in

   the grand jury provides not only the highlights that were in

   the proffer but provides much of the detail that was presented

   to us in the additional sessions.

            THE COURT:  Well, was there a time before the grand

   jury some kind of signed statement or adopted statement by



                                                                           471



   either of these witnesses?

            MR. HARTZLER:  No.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, based on that our

   understanding of the Jencks Act, and I think the Court has

   alluded to this, whether witnesses adopted any statements any

   attorneys made would not fall within the scope of the Brady

   request.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  Well, I listened carefully to

   Mr. Hartzler's statement, and what he said was for the most

   part it is disclosed in the grand jury transcripts.  He didn't

   say it's all disclosed.  He said, quote, for the most part,

   close quote.  And then he said, it is, quote, highlighted,

   close quote, in the grand jury.  And most of the details are

   there.

            So by his admission to the Court, there are still

   statements made by Mr. Fortier and presumably Mrs. Fortier that

   have not been disclosed to the defendant.  We ask --

            THE COURT:  I asked specifically about that, and the

   answer was no.  I'm excluding any conversation with counsel in

   which he might have primarily outlined what his client might

   say.  And I'm in disagreement with you with respect to whether

   that is discoverable because I think it not.

            MR. JONES:  I understand the Court's position.  We --



                                                                           472



   but I know the Court will give us this opportunity to make the

   record.  We believe that, to paraphrase Mr. Hartzler, most of

   the highlights of what finally emerged are in the grand jury.

   What we submit occurred was that inconsistencies and

   contradictions were made in Mr. Fortier's behalf by his

   attorney and that the Government simply refused to deal with

   him until it got what it wanted.  And if Mr. Fortier said or

   his attorney on his behalf said, all my client knows about

   Mr. McVeigh is one and two, and then later said, well, he knows

   one, two, three, four, and five, that's the inconsistency.

            If the Court feels that we're not entitled to that, I

   just wanted to make it clear, that's what we're asking for.

   We're asking for those things during the plea session and the

   discussions and negotiations that were contradictory or

   incomplete either between the two Fortiers or what they told

   the grand jury.

            THE COURT:  My ruling is those things requested are

   not statements, and therefore Request No. 80 is denied.

            MR. JONES:  And would that also be the same for 84,

   your Honor?

            THE COURT:  Well, let me be sure.

            MR. JONES:  Page 33 of the Government's response.

            THE COURT:  What is it in the request?

            MR. WYATT:  Paragraph No. --

            MS. WILKINSON:  It's Paragraph No. 84, your Honor,



                                                                           473



   Government response 58, and it's on page 33.

            THE COURT:  I'm asking for what it is in the request

   itself.

            MR. JONES:  Prior -- strike prior.  Inconsistent

   statements made by Michael and Lori Fortier or on their behalf

   through their authorized representatives during the plea

   bargain sessions.

            THE COURT:  The statements have been produced as

   represented by counsel.  So the statements on their behalf or

   conversation about what their statements might be, that's

   denied, yes, 84.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, perhaps I misunderstood.  I

   don't believe we have any statements Mr. Fortier made when he

   met with Mr. Hartzler or the FBI during those sessions.

            THE COURT:  Well, there aren't any before the grand

   jury, as I understand it, from Mr. Hartzler.  The grand jury

   testimony are the statement.  And I asked Mr. Hartzler --

   correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Hartzler -- were there any

   statements from these witnesses before they appeared before the

   grand jury.

            MR. HARTZLER:  I believe you asked if there were any

   written or recorded statements, and my answer was there were

   not.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  I don't mean to belabor it, but there's a



                                                                           474



   difference about Mr. Fortier came in and made an oral

   statement, he didn't sign.

            THE COURT:  And then it would have to be, as it is

   under the Goldberg case, it would have to be adopted by him,

   that somebody took notes and he reviewed the notes and adopted

   it.

            MR. JONES:  Even if it's exculpatory?  Is that the

   Court's ruling?  I just want to be sure so that it's clear in

   case any . . . .

            THE COURT:  Exculpatory of Mr. McVeigh?

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.

            THE COURT:  I don't know.

            MR. JONES:  Or Giglio material.

            THE COURT:  Giglio goes to whether it's an

   inconsistency.  Since it isn't a statement, it isn't going to

   be an inconsistent statement.

            MR. JONES:  If Mr. Fortier said, say, to Mr. Hartzler,

   Mr. McVeigh and I went to Kansas in November and then two days

   later he says, no, we went to Kansas in December, and that's an

   oral statement, he didn't write it down.

            THE COURT:  If Mr. Fortier is a witness at trial, you

   can question him with respect to whether he made any such

   statements, of course.  But we're dealing here with discovery,

   and it's not discoverable under any of the standards to

   discovery, 16, Brady, or whatever.  Excepting unless it led to



                                                                           475



   something that the Government knows about which can come within

   the Government's obligation under the due process principles of

   Brady.  All right.

            So is 89 the next one?

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, I had as the next one 138.

            THE COURT:  Okay.  I think we had reserved 89 and 92,

   which is why I mentioned them, but maybe you don't need them

   now.

            MR. JONES:  Well, let me look at them for a moment.

   Your Honor, I believe those two are related to the CIPA

   matters, and those are going to be discussed in that context.

            THE COURT:  All right.  138.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, I have in my notes that

   Mr. Jones reserved No. 92 which is on page 22 because it wasn't

   styled as a request and he said he would come back and make

   that request.

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MR. JONES:  I'll take that one up out of order, then.

   I was going to address it later, but I can address it now.

            Mr. Wyatt reminds me that yesterday, I said I would

   submit that to them in a letter.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  So I think that does take us to --

            THE COURT:  138.

            MR. JONES:  138 was any and all information concerning



                                                                           476



   dispatch of the bomb squad of the Oklahoma City Police

   Department, Oklahoma City Sheriff's Department, Oklahoma City

   Fire Department, or any other law enforcement agency to the

   downtown Oklahoma City area anytime during the week prior to

   and the morning of April 19, 1995, before 9 a.m.  This request

   includes but is not limited to any information of the report or

   statements of attorney Dan Adonitis, A-D-O-N-I-T-I-S, of a bomb

   squad truck in the vicinity of the Murrah Building at around

   7:30 a.m. on April 19 and reports by federal employees of a

   bomb truck parked near the parking lot of the Murrah Building

   on the morning of April 19, 1995.

            What we are specifically referring to here, your

   Honor, is there are a number of statements which have appeared

   in the press and in certain other material given to us by the

   Government that suggests in the early morning hours of the

   April the 19th, before the bomb exploded that bomb squad

   vehicles of the Oklahoma County sheriff's department were seen

   in the downtown Oklahoma City area and that personnel from

   those offices were seen in and around the Murrah Building.

   Well, perhaps not in the Murrah Building, but around the Murrah

   Building.

            The Government has furnished to us information

   consisting of 302's about responding to this matter in which it

   is suggested that the bomb squad vehicles were, in fact, on the

   streets, but that it was a routine training exercise and



                                                                           477



   unrelated to any prior warning or concern about the bomb.

            Information has come to us that that is not true.  And

   we want to be sure -- because it's extremely important -- that

   we have everything and that the Government has made a

   due-diligence inquiry and investigation concerning this matter

   and that we have all of the material relating to the presence

   of Oklahoma County bomb squad vehicles in the immediate

   downtown Oklahoma City area and, in particular, around the

   Murrah Building or the federal buildings.

            THE COURT:  Well, are you asking for a log or a

   dispatch or something from the police department?

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.  We asked for that.  I think the

   way the request was, any and all information, but that would

   include logs, training manuals --

            THE COURT:  Yeah, not just the federal government's

   information --

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.

            THE COURT:  -- but what they got from the local police

   department.

            MR. JONES:  And we were trying to avoid the issuance

   of a Rule 17C subpoena.

            THE COURT:  Okay, I understand.  All right, Ms.

   Wilkinson.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, we have disclosed

   interviews with the actual members of the bomb squad and any



                                                                           478



   records they provided to us already which document that they

   were, in fact, on a training exercise early that morning and

   left to go out to the range.  And I believe we even have

   documentation from the range showing that they were there at

   around the time of the bombing.  But anything in our

   possession, we will disclose and if we receive further

   information on that -- I don't see that it's exculpatory, but

   we will disclose it nevertheless.

            THE COURT:  Well, has anybody actually checked the

   records of the police department or fire department or whoever

   dispatches them?

            MS. WILKINSON:  I believe, as I said, we have the

   records from the bomb squad itself showing that they were --

   they had a training exercise scheduled and that the vehicles

   were out at that time and then went to the range.

            THE COURT:  And then you have 302's of the interviews

   that you mentioned?

            MS. WILKINSON:  Yes, your Honor.  And I believe all

   those have already been disclosed to the defense.  And if we

   receive a logbook -- I'm just not sure whether the logbook is

   in our possession or not, but I will --

            THE COURT:  -- double-check --

            MS. WILKINSON:  -- double-check and make sure that if

   there is such a thing that we provided to the defense.

            THE COURT:  If they were on a training exercise, I



                                                                           479



   suppose they weren't dispatched; they just went out there.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Sure.

            THE COURT:  Somebody ought to check the dispatch

   record or log or whatever the routine record keeping function

   is.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Again, we would be disclosing this, I

   think, just under our general discovery policy, not as

   exculpatory unless we came across something that contradicted

   it, which we have not seen.

            THE COURT:  Okay.  That is an adequate response.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, one of the items left over was

   No. 41, but I believe that that has been resolved.  The

   Government represents that it has furnished everything to us in

   that respect, and I assume that there are items in the 1A and

   1B, we'll see them again when we go through the inspection that

   we agreed upon day before yesterday.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. JONES:  Item No. 1, your Honor --

            MS. WILKINSON:  Are you referring to page 36 of the

   Government's brief?

            MR. WYATT:  Page 42.

            MR. JONES:  I believe it's page 42.  Well, that's a

   general Brady request, your Honor.

            MR. WYATT:  No, no.

            MR. JONES:  Oh, I'm sorry.  Excuse me.



                                                                           480



            MS. WILKINSON:  I believe, Mr. Jones, if you're

   talking about No. 1, it's on page 36.  We had left that

   unresolved as to David Irving.

            MR. JONES:  It is David Irving.

            MS. WILKINSON:  That's on page 36.

            MR. JONES:  Oh, I see.  Okay.  Paragraph 1.  It's on

   page 36, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. JONES:  We asked for copies of any and all

   statements of David Irving to a U.S. embassy official in

   London.  This arose in the context, your Honor, of a statement

   that Mr. Irving gave us.  Mr. Irving is a British historian and

   writer and may generally be described, at least in some of his

   writings, as a Holocaust revisionist, although he's written a

   number of other books that are universally well regarded and

   don't touch that controversial subject.  This follows an

   article which appeared in Newsweek magazine which purports to

   quote Mr. Irving, and he has confirmed it to me in a statement

   that he sent us, that he made a statement to the United States

   embassy in London to a representative of that embassy in the

   embassy concerning his knowledge of Terry or James Nichols, and

   specifically with certain alleged contributions that one or

   both of them may have made to his defense fund relating to

   lawsuits that had been filed against him because of certain

   political statements that he had made.



                                                                           481



            These matters -- and I'm measuring my words or trying

   to measure my words carefully here -- relate to certain defense

   investigations concerning people in and around Elohim City,

   Mr. Strassmeir, Mr. Mahon and others, so we simply ask for a

   copy of Mr. Irving's statement because the quotation which

   appeared in Newsweek magazine suggested that he had had the

   meeting, that he had made statements about certain

   communication and correspondence that he had had concerning

   moneys that had been sent to him in the pursuit of his

   political interests.  No such statement has been provided to

   us.

            THE COURT:  Well, did he tell you it was a written

   statement?

            MR. JONES:  I inferred from his comments that he went

   in and was interviewed and his statement was taken down.  I

   didn't ask him if it was signed or not.  I don't know whether

   he made a written statement.  I sent him a series of letters,

   and I think his response -- if I can recall it correctly -- was

   that he went to the embassy and made a statement which was

   taken down.  I believe that's the way he characterized it.  And

   purported to describe what was in the statement.

            THE COURT:  All right, Ms. Wilkinson.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, first, it sounds like this

   is information that's already within the custody and control of

   the defense.  But we do not have any statements by David Irving



                                                                           482



   to a U.S. embassy official in London.  We have not specifically

   requested such a statement from the State Department.  Because

   Mr. Jones has told us that the basis of this is that Mr. Irving

   has information that James or Terry Nichols contributed to his

   legal defense fund, and I can't imagine that merely because a

   defendant contributed to someone else's legal defense fund that

   that's somehow exculpatory as to Mr. McVeigh.  So the

   combination, I think, would put it beyond the scope of Brady;

   1, that it doesn't appear to be exculpatory --

            THE COURT:  It may be discoverable on another ground.

            MS. WILKINSON:  If Mr. Jones already has contact with

   Mr. Irving --

            THE COURT:  The question, is though, whether the State

   Department has this record.

            MS. WILKINSON:  We'll be glad to check with the State

   Department, your Honor.  It's no problem.

            THE COURT:  Please do, and report back to counsel.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, there is one other matter

   which is not specifically in the Brady motion but which was

   addressed in an earlier motion, part of which was heard in

   chambers, but I think falls outside the scope of the necessity

   for a closed hearing since it's also been a matter that has

   appeared in the press.

            We made a request for the Government for a production

   of the report given to the ATF or the document given to the ATF



                                                                           483



   by two Israeli bomb experts who came to Oklahoma City

   approximately ten days, two weeks after our client was taken

   into custody.  We have submitted to the Court information that

   they were present and made such a report.  They were there with

   the ATF, and it seems to me that it clearly falls under the

   nature of scientific or laboratory analysis of the improvised

   explosive device.

            As the Court may know, we received one page which was

   attached to another matter.  But we ask the Court to inquire of

   the Government if such a document exists, if they made inquiry

   of all responsible agencies, including specifically the ATF,

   we've even given them the name of the agent that accompanied

   the two Israelis, and we'd like a copy of the Israelis' report,

   particularly since it relates -- the first page makes it clear

   that it is a discussion and description and opinion of the

   nature and size of destruction of the improvised explosive

   device and we are reliably informed that it consisted of a

   minimum of three pages, not one page.

            THE COURT:  All right, Ms. Wilkinson.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Your Honor, we have contacted the ATF.

   The Israeli experts that came over to look at the building came

   over approximately two weeks after the building (sic), and the

   ATF acted only as liaison to let them get into the building,

   into the area and look at.  They were there one or two days --

            THE COURT:  There was dispute in the earlier papers



                                                                           484



   about why they were there.  The Government's position, as I

   recall it, was they were there for purposes of the Israeli

   government, not the United States.

            MS. WILKINSON:  Correct.  They obviously have an

   interest in the -- as I think most governments would -- in

   examining a large bombing crime scene like this because,

   unfortunately, the Israelis have suffered --

            THE COURT:  Well, do they -- does the ATF have a

   report --

            MS. WILKINSON:  No, the ATF does not have a report.

   The Israelis were not acting on behalf of the United States.

   The one-page report that we received which was given to a

   private citizen and then to the mayor of Oklahoma City was

   provided to the defense.  And nothing in that indicates that

   the Israelis said anything about this being -- this bombing

   being conducted by anyone.  They didn't comment on who did it.

   There was some allegation that they commented that a foreign

   powers or Iraqis did that and there's no evidence of that.

            THE COURT:  Was there some recording of some opinion

   that this demonstrated some sort of a signature in --

            MS. WILKINSON:  None.

            THE COURT:  -- the form of the bomb?

            MS. WILKINSON:  No, there was no comment on that.  The

   report was more of a structural analysis of what brought the

   building down, what columns I believe it discussed, but there



                                                                           485



   was no comment about some bomb maker's signature or some other

   person involved.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MR. JONES:  May I respond?

            THE COURT:  Yeah.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, our information is to the

   contrary, and I do not believe the Government has made a

   sufficient search.  There is an agreement between the United

   States and Israel on coordination of terrorist affairs, and no

   less a person than the senior Israeli terrorist adviser to the

   Prime Minister Netanyahu has reported to the defendants through

   an intermediary that this cooperation continues, that three

   people came over, they examined the bomb, and that this was a

   part of an ongoing consultation and that the consultation

   continued and that just recently they had another meeting with

   Mr. Wilcox in the State Department.

            And I ask that the Government contact the State

   Department, the FBI, and the ATF and any other agency that may

   have the complete report because I am led to believe that, in

   fact, there is substantial comment concerning the nature,

   signature of the improvised explosive device pursuant to an

   agreement of cooperation between this Government and Israel.

            THE COURT:  Specifically as to this event?

            MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.  That's part of the

   coordination.



                                                                           486



            THE COURT:  The general coordination, I can

   understand.  I don't see its materiality.

            MR. JONES:  Well, the Israelis are experts in this

   matter.  One of our own experts is an Israeli.

            THE COURT:  I'm not suggesting to the contrary.  But

   obviously there's a broader scope, I would hope, of

   international cooperation than simply relates to the

   investigation of this event.

            MR. JONES:  Your Honor, it is, but I respectfully

   submit it is simply not credible that representatives of a

   foreign government came to this country pursuant to an

   agreement and didn't leave with our government a copy of their

   findings, reports, and conclusions.  Such would be unheard of

   in the international --

            THE COURT:  You have greater familiarity with

   international agreements than I do, apparently.  I'm accepting

   the Government's response.

            What else do we have on this motion?

            MS. WILKINSON:  I believe that's all, your Honor.

            MR. JONES:  I'm informed by Ms. Merritt that the

   matters concerning the two motions that she filed have been

   resolved.

            THE COURT:  The identification?

            MS. MERRITT:  Just the identification, right.

            THE COURT:  All right.



                                                                           487



            MS. MERRITT:  But we do want to present how we

   resolved it to the Court.

            THE COURT:  Go ahead.

            MS. MERRITT:  The motion that we're talking about is

   Defendant McVeigh's motion for production of identification

   discovery pursuant to Rule 16 and Brady.

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MS. MERRITT:  And that consisted of 17 different

   requests that we had made for documents.

            THE COURT:  That was docket entry 1939.

            MS. MERRITT:  Correct.

            THE COURT:  Yes.

            MS. MERRITT:  And those were items that related to

   identification of either Mr. McVeigh or coparticipants, alleged

   coparticipants, misidentification, and suggestive

   identification procedures.  And I would just like to run

   through each one and tell the Court where we are, and I believe

   there won't be anything left to be resolved.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MS. MERRITT:  With respect to No. 1, which was the

   names and addresses of the artists of the composite drawings of

   the suspects, I believe that we have those already.

            So there is nothing else to provide.

            THE COURT:  Fine.

            MS. MERRITT:  With respect --



                                                                           488



            THE COURT:  The motion was filed sometime ago, I

   think.

            MS. MERRITT:  Yes.

            THE COURT:  It was filed August 30.

            MS. MERRITT:  Right.

            THE COURT:  So things have happened since then.

            MS. MERRITT:  That's right.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            MS. MERRITT:  With respect to No. 2 which is the names

   and addresses of all persons who provided descriptions or

   details for the composite drawings, it's my understanding that

   there were two such persons, and we know who they are.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MS. MERRITT:  Item No. 3 was the names and addresses

   of all witnesses who observed the live lineups or photo spreads

   in this case.  And it is my understanding that that information

   is contained in the 302's that we have been provided.

            And the problem before was, as the Court knows, there

   were 24,000 witness statements provided and there was no index

   where we could just find who are the witnesses who observed

   lineups, and it appears that the Government -- my understanding

   is it has -- they started to prepare such a list and then they

   never got completed.  At this point in time we have the 302's

   also, so we are equally capable of searching now and finding it

   and searching the data bases to find all the 302's and their



                                                                           489



   serial numbers.  The Government, I think, is going to turn over

   to us the list that it had as of the time that they stopped

   working on it and we'll just take it over and finish on our

   own.

            MR. MENDELOFF:  Your Honor, if I could make one point

   clear on that.  Is that that list that we're turning over is

   something that's very much a work in progress.  The list that

   we're turning over, we're turning over basically in the spirit

   of your Honor's ruling yesterday with regard to the telephone

   summary.

            THE COURT:  So that there might be work together

   ultimately, but, anyway, you're going to give it where it

   stands now and then the defense can carry it on on their own?

            MR. MENDELOFF:  Exactly.  And because it's a work in

   progress, we can't vouch for its accuracy and completeness, but

   they can have what we have.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you, Mr. Mendeloff.

            MS. MERRITT:  No. 4 is any and all written notes,

   memorandum, or transcripts made of any identification witness

   who viewed the defendant or any other alleged coparticipants.

   It's my understanding that the Government will provide this as

   to any identification witnesses they intend to call at trial.

   And if we then go through that and decide that there's some

   other persons who viewed this stuff who we want to get more

   information about, we'll provide that to the Government and



                                                                           490



   they'll try and find it for us.

            MR. MENDELOFF:  Your Honor, one matter in

   clarification on that.  We had originally agreed early in this

   case to turn over all the witnesses that are going to be

   identification witnesses 60 days before trial, but in the

   interest of pushing the process forward, we're going to produce

   it -- be producing them on January 6 -- I'm sorry --

   December 6, and we've also agreed with the defense, subject to

   your Honor's views on it, that the defense will file a motion,

   any motions to suppress regarding that identification testimony

   by December, I'm sorry, January 21.

            THE COURT:  Well, we'll get into the detailed

   scheduling when we recess here.  Thank you.

            MR. MENDELOFF:  Okay.

            MS. MERRITT:  With respect to item No. 5, the

   statement describing in detail the methods and procedures used

   to identify the defendant, it's my understanding that the

   Government does not have any written statements of the

   procedures that were used in exhibiting these photo

   identification spreads.  However, they -- as to the witnesses

   that they are going to call at trial, they're going to get a

   statement from the agents as to what they did and as to the

   procedure.  If there are any other people that we also want to

   have, find out what the agent said to these people as they were

   being shown photographs, we'll advise the Government and they



                                                                           491



   will inquire of the agents and try and get that for us.

            THE COURT:  The focus is on trial witnesses for that.

            MR. MENDELOFF:  Right.  And that's not exactly

   accurate.  It's possible that the individual 302's for the

   people involved may have recitation of the procedures used.  To

   the extent they don't, we'll provide them, and it's my

   understanding that Ms. Merritt needs that to assess whether or

   not they want to file a motion to suppress as to individual

   identification.

            THE COURT:  So you're going back to the authors of the

   302's?

            MR. MENDELOFF:  Yes, sir.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MS. MERRITT:  That would go as to whether or not any

   of these procedures might have been impermissibly suggestive.

            THE COURT:  I understand.

            MS. MERRITT:  Item No. 6 is the names and addresses of

   all persons who were present when photographs were exhibited or

   audio or videotapes played for identification.  And it's my

   understanding as to the trial witnesses the Government intends

   to call, they're going to provide that to us.

            MR. MENDELOFF:  That's inaccurate.  We don't view the

   existence of other people during the identifications, other

   than the agent who authored the report, as being relevant to

   this issue.



                                                                           492



            THE COURT:  Well, it can be, if there was a discussion

   about it.

            MR. MENDELOFF:  Right.

            THE COURT:  I mean, if something is shown to a person,

   a photograph, drawing, or whatever and there are two or three

   people around and they discuss the, yeah, it looks like, it

   doesn't look like, I think it's relevant.

            MR. MENDELOFF:  We'll provide.

            MS. MERRITT:  Item No. 7 is identity and copies of all

   exhibits shown and audio or videotapes played for the purposes

   of identification in this case.  And it's my understanding as

   to the witnesses that the Government is going to call at trial,

   they're going to provide that.  If there is any others that we

   want or we have questions about, we'll ask them and try to get

   them to us.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MS. MERRITT:  No. 8 is the names and addresses of

   all -- we're withdrawing No. 8.  We're not going to request

   that anymore.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MS. MERRITT:  No. 9 is all copies of all photo spreads

   together with a list of all persons to whom those photo lineups

   were shown and then a list of the 1A, 1B, or 1C number.  As I

   said before, we already have -- well, they're going to provide

   duplicate originals of the photographs that were shown as to



                                                                           493



   the trial witnesses.  And if there is any others that we want

   to see, we'll ask them.

            MR. MENDELOFF:  That's right.  That's correct.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MS. MERRITT:  For No. 10, it's the specific

   photographs used in each and every photographic display.  We

   have been advised as to how many photographic displays there

   were, and again, they're going to be providing the duplicate

   originals for each of them.

            MR. MENDELOFF:  Your Honor, just so the record is

   clear, what we've informed the defense is that there was one

   photo array used in this case and a series of photo spreads; a

   photo spread applicable to Mr. McVeigh, Mr. Nichols, et cetera.

   We're going to provide one copy of each of those, rather than

   50 copies of photo spreads to the extent that there were 50

   different people that looked at the photo spread.

            THE COURT:  But the copy will be -- it's a bit awkward

   to speak of original copies, but it's not going to be Xerox?

            MR. MENDELOFF:  That's right, your Honor.

            MS. MERRITT:  A duplicate original.

            THE COURT:  I have trouble understanding what that is.

            MS. MERRITT:  And in connection with this, it's my

   understanding that no individual photographs were shown to any

   witnesses, and we accept the Government's representation as

   to --



                                                                           494



            MR. MENDELOFF:  That is not right.  There was a photo

   array, I explained last night, but there was a photo array used

   in which a whole series of people were shown in individual

   photos, 15 people in a photo array.

            THE COURT:  Were they shown one at a time?

            MR. MENDELOFF:  They were shown them together, do you

   recognize any of these people.

            THE COURT:  I think that's the distinction that

   counsel was making, not individually.

            MS. MERRITT:  With respect to No. 11 and 12, the date

   and location, time and place, I believe we have those in the

   302's.  If there's any we have questions about, we will ask the

   Government, and they'll clarify it for us.

            THE COURT:  Good.

            MS. MERRITT:  No. 13 is the name and addresses of

   persons who from these photographs or tapes identify the

   defendant and codefendant and participants and I believe that

   this has already been provided in the 302's.

            14 is a summary of comments concerning the

   identification procedure made by any law enforcement officers.

   If these are not in the 302's, they will provide them as to the

   trial witnesses that they intend to call and if we have

   questions about others, we'll ask and they'll inquire as to the

   agents who did it as to whether there were any.

            MR. MENDELOFF:  That's correct, your Honor.



                                                                           495



            MS. MERRITT:  15 is summary of any and all comments

   made by law enforcement officers after the photographic

   procedure, and it's the same as before.  They'll provide it as

   to the trial witnesses.  If we have questions about any others,

   we'll ask them and they'll clarify it for us.

            16 is the names and addresses of persons who were

   unable to identify defendants or known participants.  It's my

   understanding that this is provided in the 302's that we've

   received to date.

            MR. MENDELOFF:  To the extent it's documented, that's

   correct, your Honor.

            MS. MERRITT:  17 is identification witness if they

   didn't identify the defendants, who they did identify.  And

   it's my understanding this is already contained in the 302's

   we've received to date.

            MR. MENDELOFF:  To the extent it's documented in the

   302's.

            THE COURT:  To the extent it's documented.

            MR. MENDELOFF:  That's right.

            MS. MERRITT:  And if we have any questions about

   anybody else, we'll ask them.

            THE COURT:  Thank you.  I appreciate the work counsel

   obviously did in resolving those issues.

            Now, we still have a matter unresolved, and that is

   the motion filed on behalf of Mr. Nichols for disclosure of



                                                                           496



   information concerning Government's group meeting with

   potential witnesses.

            Mr. Woods, you wish to present that?

            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor.  May it please the Court,

   I would like to touch on one matter that Mr. Mendeloff

   mentioned.  He may want to refresh his memory.  I've read 302's

   where individual witnesses were shown one photograph at a time,

   so I'm sure he did not intentionally overlook that.

            THE COURT:  Well, it's not surprising that in taking

   these interviews, they say have you ever seen this person, or

   something like that.

            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  That's what you're referring to, I take

   it.

            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  As opposed to the interview for the

   purpose of in and of itself making a display of photographs or

   drawings?

            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, we are asking for a list of

   the attendees and any written report or record of two meetings

   that occurred in Oklahoma City approximately three weeks ago on

   October 27 and 28.  They came to light because of press

   coverage here in Denver and in Oklahoma City.  I understand



                                                                           497



   that there was a meeting with the victim/witnesses on Sunday

   night, October 27, approximately 200 present.  On Monday night

   approximately 100 present.

            The comments that are reported in the press after this

   meeting cause us some concern of possible violation of Rule

   615, the exclusion of witnesses, and also possible violation of

   the Court's order of June 13 regarding extracurricular

   statements of counsel and the support staff in this case.

            THE COURT:  Extrajudicial I think it says, not

   extracurricular.  Maybe I'm mistaken.

            MR. WOODS:  You're exactly right, your Honor,

   extrajudicial statements.

            MR. JONES:  We'd like to stop the others, too, your

   Honor.

            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, I would like to quote two or

   three of the statements that were reported in quotation marks

   after the meeting.  A Ms. Kathleen Treanor reported that I can

   certainly see how we would have an open-and-shut case, it's

   nice to hear our side of the story.

            And Mr. Daniel DeMoss said that I think the evidence

   they have is really clear-cut, I think they just can't wait to

   get this thing to trial.  Further he said that he heard how

   little it would cost to construct a fertilizer bomb that blew

   up the building, less than $500, in this conference.

            And Mr. Hartzler was then quoted as he came out of the



                                                                           498



   meeting that he said that prosecutors have evidence that has

   not been made public yet.  There's been some information that

   has gotten out, no question about that, but there is evidence

   that the Government will present at trial that has not yet been

   presented publicly.  I think that's definitely the case.

            He then characterized the meeting as stating to that

   extent I think we were able to, I hope, lay to rest some of the

   claims of what I characterize as the wacky theories; that is,

   the defense theories.  These are statements made to the press

   after the meeting there in Oklahoma City.

            We feel that this is a possible violation of the

   Court's extrajudicial statement ruling issued on June 13, '95,

   on page 10, specifically where the Court admonishes all counsel

   not to make any statement as to any opinion as to the guilt or

   innocence of the defendants or as to the merits of the case or

   the quality or quantity of evidence, as to any charge in the

   case.

            Also, on page 9 of the Court's orders, none of the

   lawyers appearing in this case or any persons associated with

   them, including any persons with a supervisory authority over

   them, will release or authorize the release of information or

   opinion about this criminal proceeding which a reasonable

   person would expect to be disseminated by any means of public

   communication if there is a reasonable likelihood that such

   disclosure will interfere with a fair trial of the pending



                                                                           499



   charges or otherwise prejudice the due administration of

   justice.

            The Court issued this order after a number of comments

   and in the press over a period of a year.  And when the parties

   brought it to the attention of the Court, the Court issued this

   order and gave us a stern warning as to trying to minimize the

   publicity in this case so we can pick a jury here in Colorado.

            And we feel that the comments made here and also the

   comment made in this morning's press by one of the prosecutors,

   in The Denver Post, second page, We want to get the evidence

   before a jury and the American public, we want justice to

   prevail and see the defendants sentenced to death, those are

   comments that are not going to help us reach -- find a jury

   that's not been prejudiced or biased in this case.

            And we ask, number one -- back to our motion, we ask

   for the list of attendees so that if some of them testify at

   trial, we can inquire as to whether or not there were group

   meetings of witnesses wherein the evidence was discussed with

   them, because that will affect their testimony.

            And then secondly, we would like a report.  The

   Government rarely has meetings where reports are not compiled,

   and we would like to get the report of that to see if that did

   occur.  The Government has represented to us that we don't

   really understand the Victims Rights and Restitution Act of

   1990 and they have a right to meet with victims.  I understand



                                                                           500



   that fully.  The Act was passed in 1990 when I was a U.S.

   Attorney, and I hired the first victim/witness coordinator and

   implemented the act in the fifth largest office in the country.

   They have probably the best victim/witness coordinator I have

   ever seen and any of the 93 United States Attorney's offices

   would be proud to have.  Ms. Lynn Anderson is doing a super job

   in this case and is helping in the healing and counseling of

   the victims in this case and keeping them advised of the status

   of the case.

            But the Victims Right and Restitution Act does not

   authorize the Government meeting with victims in groups and

   discussing the evidence with them in preparation for their

   testimony.  And so we would respond to their allegation that

   this was merely a meeting pursuant to the Victims Right Act.

   It cannot be used as a cover to go out and hold these group

   meetings, discuss the testimony.  They know from past

   experience that these victims, who the press has great sympathy

   for, will make numerous comments to the press and the press

   will repeat those comments.  The Government knows --

            THE COURT:  What is the language?  I don't have that

   opinion in front of me that I authored.  But something about a

   substantial probability that it will become public.

            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  Is that essentially --

            MR. WOODS:  Yes, if there's reasonable likelihood that



                                                                           501



   such disclosure will interfere with the trial of the pending

   charges or otherwise prejudice the administration of justice.

            THE COURT:  Well, there's something about the

   probability --

            MR. WOODS:  Which a reasonable person would expect to

   be disseminated by any means of public communication.

            THE COURT:  Right.

            MR. WOODS:  And we think that based on the history of

   this case, the Government fully knows and understands and may

   be using it -- although I don't want to attribute that to

   them -- but the Government understand that the victims are

   going to be speaking out publicly and that the press will

   invariably repeat what they state.  So we think that to make

   sure that we can have a fair trial in this case, we ask that

   the comments stop and we ask that we be given a list of the

   attendees for proper cross-examination when they testify at the

   trial, be it the guilt or innocence or the punishment hearing.

            THE COURT:  All right.

            Mr. Hartzler, are you going to respond.

            MR. HARTZLER:  Yes.

            MR. JONES:  Before Mr. Hartzler responds, Mr. Burr

   has, I don't know whether the Court wants to know whether we

   join in or distinguish ourselves.

            THE COURT:  Go ahead, Mr. Burr, and we'll get a

   response from both of you.



                                                                           502



            MR. BURR:  Your Honor, we filed a pleading early this

   morning which you may not have seen.

            THE COURT:  Joining.

            MR. BURR:  We joined in part.  Our concern was also on

   the statements by the victims that were quoted in the newspaper

   and the statements by Mr. Hartzler, Mr. Ryan, and we are

   certainly -- part of what happened here was shortly after this

   reporting.

            Mr. Hartzler had a conversation with Mr. Jones and

   apologized for his comments.  And we accepted that, and we

   acknowledged that in the heat of the moment, at times each of

   us makes things that sometimes we -- make comments that we

   later wish we had not made or made differently.  And our

   concern is not so much with attorney comments, although it

   continues to be a bit of a concern in light of the report this

   morning.

            What is of more concern, I think, is what was passed

   on by the victims, characterizing the evidence in the case and

   characterizing defense strategy or defense questions.  Had the

   attorneys themselves made that, those comments, they would have

   clearly been in violation of the order.  And making them in a

   meeting which was private was probably not inappropriate, but

   making them in a meeting and then knowing that there was press

   outside and not taking any steps to be sure that those comments

   were not passed on to the press is a problem.



                                                                           503



            It raises in our view a need for the Court to consider

   extending the order concerning extrajudicial statements to

   victims, not in a broad way, but in a way that when counsel for

   the Government meets with victims and discusses the evidence in

   the case in a way that could lead to comments that might be

   prejudicial and would be violative of the order, victims should

   be bound by that order as well.  So we would ask that the Court

   consider that small extension of the order regarding

   extrajudicial statements to victims in these very narrow kinds

   of circumstances.

            THE COURT:  How would victims be defined in such an

   order?

            MR. BURR:  Well, I would think, your Honor, they would

   be people who met with counsel for the Government because of

   their duty to meet with victims who then -- who then are privy

   to information the Government passes on about their views of

   the case.

            THE COURT:  Okay.

            Now Mr. Hartzler.

            MR. HARTZLER:  I'm having some difficulty with this

   microphone.  It won't stay up.  So if you don't mind, I'll just

   hold it.

            THE COURT:  All right.  I don't mind if you don't.

            MR. HARTZLER:  We may ask for the court mechanic to

   come and give me some help.



                                                                           504



            THE COURT:  You're assuming such a person exists.  Go

   ahead.

            MR. HARTZLER:  First of all, I accept full

   responsibility for these meetings with the victims and for

   comments that I made after the meeting.  I have one regret

   which was that the meetings were held privately and they were

   informal meetings.  The press was not invited.  And I think

   that had the press been there or frankly a defense

   representative, we might not be having this hearing and we

   might not have had the motions.

            We have routinely exercised caution in our comments to

   the press as well as in our comments to the victims, and we

   certainly did so at this meeting.  Part of the problem that we

   have faced is that the victims, as I'm sure you understand,

   want to know more than we can tell.  And in our meeting with

   them, we explained why it is that we cannot tell more than we

   have.

            Our primary purpose in meeting with them was to advise

   them of your rulings, the suppression ruling in particular, and

   the severance ruling as well and to give them some assurance

   that those rulings did not affect our presentation of evidence,

   that we didn't lose any evidence as a result of the suppression

   ruling, we didn't lose any evidence as a result of the

   severance ruling.

            In addition, we introduced each of ourselves and



                                                                           505



   talked about our background.  And I think that what resulted

   from the meeting was a feeling among the attendees that this

   was a group of well-qualified, confident prosecutors, who were

   anxious, ready to go to trial.  And my impression is that

   people left the meeting feeling good about that and therefore

   feeling good about the Government's case and therefore made

   comments about the strength of the Government's case that were

   not made inside the room.  We did not discuss the evidence with

   the victims.

            We certainly talked about the comments that Ms.

   Wilkinson has made in response so some of the discovery

   motions, and there is no doubt that we pointed out that.  For

   example, the allegation that the Government itself knew before

   the bombing that the building was going to be bombed was

   addressed, but that's been a matter of public record for many,

   many months.  You may have heard the allegation that ATF agents

   were not present in the building, and of course the ATF issued

   a press release soon after the building to detail that there

   were ATF employees in the building, and that's been reiterated

   in one of our recent responses.

            So to the extent that some people left the meeting and

   made comments indicating that we were laying out the evidence,

   it is simply incorrect; and it's for that reason that I regret

   that there wasn't someone there that could have recorded the

   meeting and I think thereby satisfied you that we're not



                                                                           506



   violating the Court's protective order.  We're being cautious

   in our conversations with the victims.  In fact, we explained

   the protective order to the victims and explained for that

   reason we wanted them not to talk about matters to the press,

   that we wouldn't talk about matters to the press.

            We obviously can't control everyone.  And I don't

   think it would be appropriate for your Honor to enter an order

   that would -- might poorly define who is covered by it.  But in

   our meetings with the victims, which I trust you're not going

   to prevent, we will continue to advise them not to make

   comments that might in any way prejudice these defendants.

            There have been exceptions, no doubt, but I think for

   the most part, the victims of this crime have demonstrated

   remarkable strength and maturity, and I'm confident they'll

   continue to do so.

            THE COURT:  Well, did you say wacky theories of the

   defense?

            MR. HARTZLER:  Your Honor, I said -- no, no.  I said

   we had laid to rest some of the wacky theories.  I wasn't

   referring -- I think the context -- I don't recall exactly.

   That's why I called Mr. Jones to apologize to him to say that

   if it in any way demeaned theories of the defenses, that was

   not the point.  The point is there has been a theory -- I don't

   believe it's the defense theory -- that the Government bombed

   its own building.  But it was really the theory based on fact



                                                                           507



   that ATF had some forewarning and the agents weren't there,

   which has been addressed in open court.

            THE COURT:  Was there some kind of record kept of who

   attended?

            MR. HARTZLER:  I believe there was certainly an RSVP

   card that came in and we had name tags made for the victims, so

   I'm confident that we could probably come up with a list

   probably from those cards or otherwise.

            THE COURT:  Now, I don't want to necessarily get

   through this motion, get some disclosing the names and

   addresses of all of the victims, the data base issue, which is

   going to be briefed.  But you have in some papers here put on a

   number of the possible victim/witnesses who may testify to

   victim impact if that becomes relevant.  And the list --

   instead of producing the list in its entirety, as Mr. Woods has

   moved, you can check the list to see if any of those people

   were in attendance.

            MR. HARTZLER:  Certainly.

            MR. WOODS:  It can be produced under seal.  We're not

   concerned with any --

            THE COURT:  I'm just going to require that the

   Government keep the record it has of who attended and be

   prepared to identify whether any persons who are then

   identified as victim/witnesses were at this or these meetings.

            MR. HARTZLER:  Certainly.



                                                                           508



            MR. WOODS:  Thank you.

            THE COURT:  Then with respect to the motion made on

   behalf of Mr. McVeigh to put some kind of restriction on

   comments by the victims, I'm not going to do that.  I think

   they have First Amendment interests here that are somewhat

   different from what a lawyer must do as an officer of the

   court, of course.  And I have some sympathy for the problem

   that the Department of Justice lawyers have in attempting to

   comply with the mandate of the 1990 statute requiring them to

   do certain things for victims and their obligations as

   prosecutors in the courtroom.

            My suggestion to you is -- and, you know, these

   private meetings as such, that's a matter of discretion as to

   whether the people who are actually trying the case do that or

   the victims assistance people do that or whatever -- but I

   must, I think, say that when you make observations to these

   people, you can't consider them to be private.

            I'm not going to require them to withhold, you know,

   comment on it.  And I think you have to therefore -- within the

   language of my memorandum opinion and order which I asked

   Mr. Woods to remind us of, you must consider that those

   conversations in groups like that will have a substantial

   probability of being publicly disseminated, and therefore the

   order applies to what you tell them.

            MR. HARTZLER:  Of course.



                                                                           509



            THE COURT:  And therefore you shouldn't be discussing

   the evidence or except in the most general of terms as you

   would if you walk out here and talk to the press.  So please

   follow that admonition.

            MR. HARTZLER:  We will.

            THE COURT:  All right.  And with respect to Ms.

   Wilkinson's, I don't know this comment, but I suppose that's

   not inconsistent with the notice of intention to seek the death

   penalty.

            MS. WILKINSON:  But I will we careful with my remarks,

   nevertheless, your Honor.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Do we have any other matters?

            MR. JONES:  I don't believe we have any other matters

   publicly, but I think we are prepared now to meet with the

   Court.  And the Court may at the conclusion decide if we may or

   may not need to come in for five or ten minutes.

            THE COURT:  All right.  Well, do you want to do that

   immediately, do you want to break first, what do you want to

   do?  You see how amenable I am when I have sensed a certain

   spirit of cooperation.

            MR. JONES:  Well, you might jeopardize it, though,

   with the breaks.

            THE COURT:  I'm at your pleasure.  If you want to

   retire to chambers immediately, we should do so.

            MR. JONES:  We should probably perhaps take a short



                                                                           510



   break.

            THE COURT:  All right, 20 minutes.

            MR. JONES:  How long did you say?

            THE COURT:  20.  We'll be in recess in open court.  I

   don't know whether we'll return to open court.  I guess it

   depends upon this.  And I'm sure those who are here understand

   the need for us to try to continue this spirit of cooperation

   in private.

            Court's in recess.

ordered separate trials for Oklahoma City bombing defendants Timothy
McVeigh and Terry Nichols. Judge Matsch singled out statements that
Nichols made to FBI agents when he was arrested two days after the
April 19, 1995, bombing as a reason for the need to have separate
trials. "There can be no effective separation of Terry Nichols'
explanations for his conduct from what he reportedly said Timothy

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO 
Chief Judge
Richard P. Matsch

Criminal Action No. 96-CR-68-M


UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

Plaintiff,

v.

TIMOTHY JAMES MCVEIGH and TERRY LYNN NICHOLS,

Defendants.


MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER FOR SEPARATE TRIALS

MATSCH, Chief Judge

The Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, was
destroyed by an explosion on April 19, 1995, killing and injuring many
people. Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols have been joined as
co-defendants in an indictment, containing 11 counts, charging
offenses alleged to be connected together as parts of a common scheme
or plan to bomb that building. This joinder of defendants and offenses
is appropriate under Fed. R. Rim P. 8. Each defendant has moved for
separate trials claiming prejudice under Rule 14, which provides as
follows:


If it appears that a defendant or the government's prejudiced by
joinder of offenses or of defendants in an indictment or information
or by such joinder for trial together, the court may order an election
or separate trials of counts, grant a severance of defendants or
provide whatever other relic! justice requires. In ruling on a motion
by a defendant for severance the court may order the attorney for the
government to deliver to the court for inspection in camera any
statements or confessions made by the defendants which the government
intends to introduce in evidence at the trial.


These motions have been fully beefed and evidence was submitted at a
hearing beginning on October 2, 1996. The parties filed additional
papers under seal because they refer to discovery material and include
attorneys' assessments of that material and statements of their
respective positions in anticipation of a trial. The court has
reviewed the sealed material in camera as permitted under Rule 14 and
finds that the sealing meets the criteria set out in the Memorandum
Opinion and Order on Media Motions issued January 24, 1996. United
States v. McVeigh, 918 F. Supp. 1452 (D. Colo. 1996). While the sealed
material has been helpful to establish context, the factual bases for
the findings and conclusions supporting this order are fully disclosed
in this memorandum opinion.

The most significant sealed documents are FBI reports of statements
made by defendant Terry Nichols to FBI agents during a nine hour
interview an April 21, 1995 at the police station in Herington,
Kansas. These reports (including agent notes in sealed Exhibit 72)
were reviewed during the hearing on Mr. Nichols' motion to suppress
agents' testimony about his interview and the government's motion in
limine for an evidentiary ruling that testimony concerning some of the
statements is admissible against both defendants. This court denied
the Nichols motion to suppress and the prosecution motion in limine in
the Memorandum Opinion and Order on Motions to Suppress Evidence and
Regarding Admissibility of Statements of Terry Lynn Nichols issued
August 14, 1996. United States v. McVeigh, __ F. Supp. __ (C). Colo.
1996), 1996 WL 478771. The most pertinent statements were paraphrased
in the record of that hearing and were described in that opinion.

The Advisory Committee Notes published with Rule 14 when it was
adopted in 1944 observed that it was a restatement of existing law
that severance and other similar relief is entirely in the discretion
of the court. The Advisory Committee Note to the 1966 Amendment
observed: "A defendant may be prejudiced by the admission in evidence
against a co-defendant of a statement or confession made by that
co-defendant. This prejudice cannot be dispelled by cross-examination
if the co-defendant does not take the stand." The Note further
explained the need for in camera inspection of such statements to aid
in determining whether the possible prejudice justifies ordering
separate trials.

The appellate courts have attempted to guide trial courts in opinions
reviewing hint trials of defendants after denial of motions to sever.
These opinions reveal the obvious advantage in hindsight. An appellate
court can measure the extent of any actual prejudice from a joint
trial by analyzing a complete trial record. Ruling on a Rule 14 motion
before trial requires the trial judge to anticipate the evidence and
events of a future trial. The presumed benefits of a Joint trial must
be weighed against the potential for harm to the integrity of the
trial process.

Trials, like all human events, are unpredictable. All of the
participants interact in public process, which, in essence, is an
historical inquiry into past events to determine whether the
prosecution has proved the defendants guilty of the crimes charged
within the rules of evidence and the applicable law. The frailties of
human nature require some constraints on the procedures used to
achieve an acceptable outcome. In some cases, a court may proceed with
a joint trial and take remedial action when actual prejudice occurs.
Even risk of a mistrial or reversible error may be acceptable under
certain circumstances. This is not such a case. The nature and scope
of the charges, the quantity of the evidence and the intensity of the
public interest in all aspects of this criminal proceeding compel
caution and restraint in ruling on these motions. The question they
present is whether separate trials are necessary to provide such
fundamental fairness as will ensure confidence in the outcome of the
trial process.

Each defendant is entitled to a jury's separate and independent
evaluation of the evidence received against him in any trial,
regardless of the number of other persons alleged to have participated
in the crimes charged. When two defendants are tried together, the
court routinely instructs the jury accordingly and requires them to
return separate verdicts. The court commonly cautions the jurors that,
in reality, two cases are being tried simultaneously and their
findings as to one defendant must not control the decision as to the
other defendant. Multiple defendants may be tried together when there
is sufficient common evidence or when there is direct evidence showing
the different. but connecting roles of each defendant. It is more
difficult to conduct a joint trial when the prosecution must rely on
indirect and circumstantial evidence to identify the perpetrators of a
crime When the court believes that such separate consideration is not
reasonably to be expected, separate trials must be ordered.

To obtain a severance under Rule 14, a defendant must show either a
"serious risk" of actual prejudice to a specific protected right or a
likelihood that a jury would be unable to make a reliable decision in
a joint trial. Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 539 (1993);
United States v. Williams, 45 F.3rd 1481, 1484 (10th Cir. 1995). A
showing of potential prejudice is not enough to require separate
trials, recognizing the public interest in economy and expedition in
judicial administration. United States v. Dirden, 38 F. 3d 1131, 1140
(10th Cir. 1994). The policy preference for a joint trial is
particularly strong when a conspiracy is charged. United States v.
Hardwell, 80 F. 3d 1471, 1486 (10th Cir. 1996). This court has
conducted many multiple defendant trials. Prejudice has been avoided
by the use of stipulations as to certain facts and agreed redactions
from exhibits and testimony. See, e.g. United States v. Lane, 883 F.2d
1484,1501 (10th Cir. 1989).

The McVeigh motion for severance centers on expected testimony of FBI
agents about their conversations with Terry Nichols on April 21 and
22, 1995. Government counsel have unequivocally said that they will
use some of these statements as admissions of Terry Nichols even if
that requires severance. The government's position is succinctly
stated in this paragraph in the brief in opposition to the defendants'
motions:


Nichols' statements are, without question, important to the case
against him. The prosecution cannot forego, even upon pain of
severance, Nichols' admissions regarding: (1) his April 16 Oklahoma
City trip; and (2) his purported truck loan to McVeigh on April 18.
The former statements are important both for their truth (showing
Nichols' involvement in what other evidence will prove was the
conspiracy to bomb a federal building) and for their falsity (showing
that Nichols lied about various makers, such as his prior contact with
McVeigh and the reason for his trip). The latter statement is
important primarily for its falsity, because other evidence will show
that Nichols could not have loaned McVeigh his truck at the times and
under the circumstances he claimed. There is, under these
circumstances, no viable option of redaction, and again the
prosecution would urge some forte of severance rather than redaction.


Docket entry 2165 at 39-40.

The government unsuccessfully sought a ruling that three "core
admissions" may be considered as evidence against both defendants
because, in the context of other expected evidence, these particular
statements by Terry Nichols inferentially incriminate him, making them
statements against his penal Interest within the exception to the
hearsay rule in Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(3). In substance, the prosecutors
say Terry Nichols admitted: (1) that Terry Nichols met with Timothy
McVeigh in Oklahoma City and drove him to Junction City, Kansas, on
April 16; (2) that Terry Nichols loaned his truck to Timothy McVeigh
for his use in Junction City, Kansas, on the morning of April 18 and
(3) that Terry Nichols removed items belonging to Timothy McVeigh from
a storage locker in Herington, Kansas, on April 20.

The FBI reports include these statements among many others made during
an interview lasting more than nine hours in the Herington, Kansas
police station on April 21. Government counsel say that they do not
intend to introduce other Nichols' statements that refer to Timothy
McVeigh or that include speculation about the possibility of Mr.
McVeigh's involvement in the bombing. The government's argument that
Terry Nichols' statements should be considered evidence against
Timothy McVeigh was that Terry Nichols connected himself with Timothy
McVeigh in ways which Mr. Nichols must have known would subject him to
criminal liability. The court ruled that while these statements are
admissions as to Terry Nichols, they are hearsay as to Timothy McVeigh
because the prosecution did not show that when he made those
statements Terry Nichols knew that Timothy McVeigh participated in the
bombing of the building. United States v. McVeigh, __ F. Supp. __ (D.
Colo. 1996), 1996 WL 478771. Such knowledge of Mr. McVeigh's guilt
would be the minimum basis for drawing any inference that by
describing these contacts with Timothy McVeigh, Terry Nichols thought
that he was incriminating himself. If these statements of Terry
Nichols are taken as true, they tend to incriminate Timothy McVeigh by
placing him in Oklahoma City on April 16 and in Junction City on April
18, in light of the government's stated intention to attach
significance to his being in those places at those times by other
evidence. Terry Nichols' removal of Timothy McVeigh's property from a
storage locker on April 20 may also be incriminating as to Mr. McVeigh
in the context of other evidence.

The government now argues that even though testimony about Mr.
Nichols' statements is inadmissible hearsay as to Timothy McVeigh, he
will not be prejudiced in a joint trial because a properly instructed
jury should be expected to disregard such testimony when they evaluate
the evidence against Mr. McVeigh. The government also suggests that
some of Terry Nichols' explanatory statements should not be classified
as hearsay because they will not be offered for their truthfulness.
Indeed, to the contrary. the prosecutors say that they will try to
prove, by other evidence, that Terry Nichols' explanations for his
actions on April 16, April 18 and April 20 are false and that he lied
to the FBI to try to avoid his criminal liability. False explanations
of incriminating evidence are probative of a consciousness of guilt.
United States v. Hackett, 638 F.2d 1179, 1186-87 (9th Cir. 1980).

It must now be assumed that Terry Nichols will not testify at a joint
trial. The Fifth Amendment prevents the government from calling him as
a witness and there is nothing to require him to decide about
testifying in his defense before the government concludes its
evidence. Therefore, Timothy McVeigh's lawyers will have no
opportunity to cross-examine Terry Nichols about his statements.
Moreover, because this testimony from FBI agents will not be received
as evidence against Timothy McVeigh, his counsel may not even
cross-examine the agents on what they say that Terry Nichols said. And
the prosecutors suggest that to avoid any incriminating effect on Mr.
McVeigh from any other statements of Terry Nichols, the court must
restrict his lawyers' cross-examination of the agents.

To evaluate Timothy McVeigh's claim of denial of his right of
confrontation, the court must expect that at trial government counsel
will call one or more of the four FBI agents who talked with Terry
Nichols on April 21 and 22, 1995, to testify as to their recollections
of what he said about these "core admissions"; that counsel for Mr.
Nichols will cross-examine them only on the statements included in
their direct testimony; that counsel for defendant McVeigh will not
cross-examine the agent witnesses and that the jury will be instructed
to consider the agents. testimony only for what they think it shows as
to the activities, personal knowledge and state of mind of Terry
Nichols. The prosecutors expect to connect up Terry Nichols'
statements by evidence that these two men joined together at times to
perform acts which resulted in the bombing of the Murrah Building on
April 19, 1995. The government lawyers will ask the jurors to be
selective in their consideration of the FBI testimony about the
Nichols' interview, believing those statements which admit his conduct
fitting into their theory of the case, disbelieving kits apparently
innocent reasons for these actions as fabricated exculpatory
explanations and disregarding all of it in deciding the case against
Timothy McVeigh. The prosecutors will argue that the reason the jury
should disbelieve Terry Nichols' explanations is that other evidence
will show a close relationship between these men for several years;
that both of them, at times, expressed similar views suggesting a
common motivation for the conspiracy charged in count one; and that
each of them did things, together and with other persons, to carry out
a common scheme to destroy the Murrah Building and its occupants.

The lawyers for Terry Nichols can be expected to conduct a vigorous
cross-examination of the FBI agents, perhaps directly challenging the
credibility of their testimony and undoubtedly suggesting that the
meaning of the statements attributed to Mr. Nichols on direct
examination is distorted unless it is considered in the context of the
entire interview and the circumstances under which it was conducted.
They will rely on such cases as Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683
(1986), to assert the right to such cross-examination. Rule 611 gives
the court discretion to permit that inquiry, and denial of it to
protect against prejudice to Timothy McVeigh would, in turn, severely
prejudice Terry Nichols. The court cannot save a joint trial by
sacrificing the interests of one defendant to protect the other.

In their attempt to show that Mr. Nichols' entire story is credible
and totally consistent with his lack of guilt, his lawyers will
probably suggest that any inconsistencies or misstatements were
because Terry Nichols was under intense pressure during the more than
nine hours that he was interrogated by two teams of FBI agents on
April 21 at the police station. While the court has read the agents'
written reports of their conversations with Terry Nichols, it has no
information about what those agents asked him, what they told him
about their suspicions or what they revealed about the investigation.
The court must assume that there was interactive conversation during
the long interview and there is a high probability that the agents
used their skills to keep Mr. Nichols talking to them. These are
subjects appropriate for cross-examination under the rule of
completeness

It is reasonable to anticipate that Mr. Nichols, counsel may attempt
to portray Timothy McVeigh as a participant in the bombing of this
building who duped his friend Terry Nichols into providing unknowing
assistance Included among the statements of Terry Nichols in the
portions of the FBI reports disclosed in the hearing and mentioned in
this court's earlier opinion is this: "I feel upset that I am
involved, in a sense, because of him, and knowing that I am not." That
can be reasonably construed as Mr. Nichols, expression of a belief in
Mr. McVeigh's guilt. Timothy McVeigh's lawyers have no chance to ask
Terry Nichols whether he said these words or what he meant by them

There can be no effective separation of Terry Nichols explanations for
his conduct from what he reportedly said Timothy McVeigh told him For
example, the FBI agents reported that Terry Nichols said that he went
to Oklahoma City on April 16 at Timothy McVeigh's request to get a
television set Mr. McVeigh was resuming to Mr. Nichols from his
ex-wife and son in Las Vegas and that Mr. McVeigh said his car broke
down while he was traveling on his way east to visit his family. To
find that explanation false, as the government requests, the jury has
several choices. They may infer that (1) Terry Nichols lied about what
Timothy McVeigh said, or (2) Timothy McVeigh lied to Terry Nichols
about why he was being asked to go to Oklahoma City, or (3) Terry
Nichols fabricated the entire story. Mr. Nichols' lawyers may be
expected to ask the jury to adopt the second possibility--that any
false parts of Terry Nichols' statements resulted from lies told to
him by Timothy McVeigh. The government may be satisfied with either
the first or second suggestion. Only Timothy McVeigh has an interest
in the third possibility--that all of what Terry Nichols said was
false. He will not be able to advance that suggestion through
cross-examination if the agents' testimony is not considered as
evidence against him. Any effort made by Mr. McVeigh's lawyers to
argue such falsity to the jury would contradict the caution that the
testimony must not be considered as evidence against Timothy McVeigh.


The agents' testimony about the exculpatory statements of Terry
Nichols can only be considered probative of his guilt if they are
accepted as an implied admission of his guilt. That interpretation
requires findings that Mr. McVeigh was a participant in the bombing,
that Terry Nichols knew that Mr. McVeigh was a participant in the
bombing and that Terry Nichols narrated a story interweaving true and
false statements of fact. Without an opportunity to cross-examine
Terry Nichols or the agents. Timothy McVeigh is caught in a dilemma.
There will be evidence that Terry Nichols and Timothy McVeigh were
associated in several ways over a substantial period of time. The
government and counsel for Terry Nichols will disagree about the
credibility and meaning of Mr. Nichols' statements about his conduct
on these three important dates, but they may well agree about the
validity of other evidence linking these two men together in ways that
may sound conspiratorial.

The adversary trial process depends upon cross-examination to
determine the reliability of the testimony of witnesses. A skilled
advocate will put questions which will reveal any failures or
weaknesses in perception, recollection and recounting by the witness,
as well as the effects of any character flaws, bias or prejudice he or
she may have. Distortions, inaccuracies and incompleteness of direct
testimony may also be disclosed as the cross-examiner seeks either to
bring out the whole story, or suggest something quite different from
what was sought to be proved. The indispensable role of
cross-examination is well summarized In the following statement found
In Wigmore:


For two centuries past, the policy of the Anglo-American system of
evidence has been to regard the necessity of testing by
cross-examination as a vital feature of the law. The belief that no
safeguard for testing the value of human statements Is comparable to
that furnished by cross. examination, and the conviction that no
statement (unless by special exception) should be used as testimony
until it has been probed and sublimated by that test, has found
increasing strength in lengthening experience.

Not even the abuses, the mishandlings, and the puerilities which are
so often found associated with cross-examination have availed to
nullify its value. It may be that in more than one sense it takes the
place in our system which torture occupied in the mediaeval system of
the civilians. Nevertheless, it is beyond any doubt the greatest legal
engine ever invented for the discovery of truth. However difficult it
may be for the layman, the scientist, or the foreign jurist to
appreciate this its wonderful power, there has probably never been a
moment's doubt upon this point in the mind of a lawyer of experience.


5 Wigmore, Evidence Sec. 1367 (Chadbourne rev. 1974) (footnote
omitted).

The historic right of crass-examination was incorporated into the
United States Constitution by the Confrontation Clause in the Sixth
Amendment. Denial of that right has often created such loss of
confidence in jury verdicts as to require reversal of convictions.
Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 415 (1965); United States v. Begay, 937
F.2d 515 (10th Cir. 1991).

Timothy McVeigh will be profoundly prejudiced by a joint trial of this
case. His lawyers cannot question Terry Nichols or cross-examine the
FBI agents on what they say Terry Nichols said and they cannot control
the cross-examination by Terry Nichols or follow up on any suggestions
or inferences of guilt of Timothy McVeigh resulting from it. The
latter may have the more severe prejudicial effect if Mr. Nichols'
lawyers implicitly accuse Timothy McVeigh of lying to Terry Nichols.
In short, Timothy McVeigh may be caught in cross-fire.

Traditionally, courts have relied upon fury instructions to separate
the evidence in multi-defendant trials. The efficacy of that practice
to avoid unfairness depends upon the level of confidence one may
reasonably have in the ability of jurors to exercise their individual
and collective discipline to follow such instructions in any
particular case.

In Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S.,123 (1968), the Supreme Court
followed several circuits and state courts in concluding that it was
unrealistic to expect a jury to disregard the confession of a
nontestifying co-defendant incriminating the nondeclarant defendant.
Accordingly, the Court held that the Sixth Amendment right of
confrontation is denied when such evidence is received at a joint
trial. The Bruton rule was narrowed in Richardson v. Marsh. 481 U.S.
200 (1987), where the Court said that if the co- defendant's
confession is redacted to exclude any reference to the existence of
the defendant, an instruction directing the jury to avoid interring
any link to him may be expected to avoid violation of the
Confrontation Clause, even though the hearsay statement may be
incriminating in the context of other properly admitted evidence Id.
at 211. There is no need to review the succeeding cases in the Circuit
Courts questioning the efficacy of such redaction to avoid any
incriminating effect on the nondeclarant defendant when the link-up
strongly suggests that the declarant's admission included the
co-defendant  The difficulties involved were discussed by the Eighth
Circuit Court of Appeals in United States v. Long, 900 F.2d 1270,
1278-80 (8th Cir. 1990). Here there are direct references to Timothy
McVeigh which, if believed, would be very incriminating in the context
of other evidence and which may strongly corroborate some of that
evidence.

The government concedes that deletion of Timothy McVeigh's name from
Terry Nichols' extrajudicial statements is not possible. Such
redaction would destroy any probative value of these statements,
making them irrelevant. They have probative value only because they
connect both defendants. In the Reply Brief of the United States
Regarding Admissibility of Nichols' Statements, government counsel
said. "Nichols core statements were incriminating precisely because,
and for the most part only because, McVeigh too was involved." Docket
entry 1563 at 8. They suggest chain of inference that Terry Nichols
knew that Timothy McVeigh participated in the bombing; Terry Nichols
admitted his association with Timothy McVeigh and acts of assistance
shortly before and after the bombing; Terry Nichols attempted to avoid
implicating himself by giving false neutral explanations for his
admitted conduct: therefore, Terry Nichols admitted that he too was
guilty as a participant in the crime. The persuasive power of that
reasoning depends upon the amount and weight of the evidence against
Timothy McVeigh, which will not be known before trial.

At the court's request, government counsel submitted proposed limiting
instructions. A copy of them is attached as an appendix to this
opinion A pre-trial evaluation of their projected efficacy is one of
the intuitive decisions which a judge must make, based upon his
experience with jury trials. The instruction to be given before the
agents testify directs the jury to consider Mr. Nichols' implied
consciousness of guilt.

You may consider Mr. Nichols' statements to the FBI only as evidence
of his own activities and his personal knowledge and state of mind. I
anticipate that the government may ask you to find that certain of Mr.
Nichols' statements were true but that others were false and that the
alleged falsity suggests a consciousness of guilt on Mr. Nichols'
part. Appendix. As previously discussed, the jury may infer from his
statements that Mr. Nichols believed Timothy McVeigh to be guilty.
That denser Is enhanced by the following language from the proposed
final instruction:

As a matter of law, you may not consider the testimony about Mr.
Nichols' statements to the FBI agents in your deliberations about Mr.
McVeigh. There is one obvious way for you to conduct your
deliberations to make It easier for you to abide by that rule. That is
to deliberate first as to whether the government has proved its case
against Mr. McVeigh beyond a reasonable doubt. In this part of your
deliberations, you could consider evidence admitted against Mr.
McVeigh, but you could not consider in any way the evidence about Mr.
Nichols' statements to the FBI agents Once you conclude your
deliberations as to Mr. McVeigh, you could then consider the charges
against Mr. Nichols. In that pert of your deliberations, and only in
that part, you could consider the evidence of Mr. Nichols' statements
to the FBI agents.

Appendix. The unacceptable risk is that any finding of not guilty as
to Timothy McVeigh would be undermined by a determination that Terry
Nichols confessed his guilty assistance In short, there is an
unacceptable risk that the jury will use Terry Nichols' extrajudicial
statements against Timothy McVeigh in derogation of his Sixth
Amendment right of confrontation and the fundamental fairness
protection of the Due Process Clause in the Fifth Amendment.

Both defendants seek severance on the ground that their defenses are
so antagonistic as to prevent a fair joint teal. The Supreme Court
limited the use of antagonistic defenses as a basis for severance,
holding that there is no per se rule of severance. More than mere
"finger pointing" is required. See Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S.
534, 54041 (1993). In United States v. Dirden, 38 F.3d 1131, 1141
(10th Cir. 1994), the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals instructed that
severance on this ground should be granted only where the defenses are
so antagonistic that they are "mutually exclusive." Thus, only when
exoneration of one defendant requires incrimination of the other is
severance required. That possibility has been shown in the foregoing
discussion of the Bruton problem in this case. Counsel for Timothy
McVeigh have argued that there is reason to believe the reverse of Mr.
Nichols' suggested defense Thus, there will be an effort to suggest
that the whole purpose of Terry Nichols' visit to the Herington police
station was to "frame" his friend Timothy McVeigh.

While the defenses of these two men may not fully meet the mutually
exclusive standard. there will be substantial and significant
differences in the tactical approaches taken by their respective
counsel. At times they will have different positions on evidentiary
objections, and different approaches to the cross-examination of the
government's witnesses and in the presentation of defense witnesses.

The conflict between the defenses of these men is even more apparent
if there is a joint penalty phase heating. Convictions upon one or
more of these charged offenses will generate mutually exclusive
defenses of their lives because each defendant will try to portray the
other as a more culpable perpetrator of the crime. There may be
unavoidable prejudice if the defendants choose to testify against each
other or if only one defendant testifies on his own behalf. Any
efficiencies achieved in a joint liability trial will then be
outweighed by extension of the time necessary for hearing the
mitigating evidence presented by each of the defendants. The increased
time necessary for a joint penalty phase trial may be critical since
the court will no longer have alternate jurors available.

Preference for a joint trial of persons charged with conspiracy and
with aiding and abetting crimes assumes efficiencies resulting in
conservation of resources, reduction in inconveniences to witnesses
and public authorities, avoidance of delays and mitigation of adverse
effects on witnesses and victims Such assumptions must be analyzed for
their validity in any particular case and their value may be
outweighed by the compelling interest in the fairness and finality of
the verdict.

There are efficiencies and advantages in single focused trials. The
time needed for jury selection is significantly reduced: the number of
defense peremptory challenges is halved and only one defense counsel
conducts voir dire questioning. It is easier to apply the rules of
evidence when there is a trial of one defendant. particularly with
regard to the admissibility of statements offered under Rule
801(d)(2); character evidence under Rule 404(a)(1) and proof of
motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge and identity
under Rule 404(b) Given these considerations, it is far from certain
that the time required for two separate trials would, in total, be
substantially greater than the time required for a joint trial.

The prosecutors raise the possibility of inconsistent verdicts in
separate trials as a policy objection to the defense motions.
Inconsistent verdicts are possible whether the defendants are tried
together or separately if the Jury does give separate consideration to
the evidence against each man. The Supreme Court has accepted
different outcomes, even though they may be illogical. because of the
unique role of the jury as fact-finder in criminal cases. United
States v. Powell. 469 U.S. 57 (1984).

The government has expressed some concern that the outcome of a first
trial will make the selection of a jury problematic for the second
defendant to be tried. Surely if a jury can be expected to give
separate consideration to each of two defendants in a joint trial, a
separate Jury in a second single defendant trial should be expected to
follow instructions to disregard the verdict of the first jury or any
of the events at the time of the first trial. The chances of obtaining
fair and impartial juries in two separate trials would certainly be
better than attempting to seat a jury after a mistrial or reversal and
new trial as a result of prejudicial joinder.

The possibility of a joint trial with separate juries has been
considered. Conceptually, that is a convenient solution. Logistically,
it is impracticable. if 6 alternate jurors were seated with each jury,
the courtroom would have to accommodate 36 jurors for most of the
trial. Moreover, the use of two juries would, at best, accommodate
only the Bruton problem of the Nichols' statements.  It would not
relieve the prejudice to each of the defendants from their
antagonistic defenses requiring different tactics and strategies
during the trial proceedings. It is reasonable to anticipate a need
for extensive hearings outside the presence of the jury to consider
conflicting defense objections and requests for cautionary
instructions during the presentation of the evidence, including
arguments about whether both juries can hear particular testimony or
see certain exhibits. The resulting delays would interrupt the rhythm
and flow of the proceedings and risk unforeseeable adverse
consequences.

Upon these findings that the government's intended use of testimony
about statements made by Terry Nichols to FBI agents would deny
Timothy McVeigh his right to confront all witnesses against him under
the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and that a
joint trial of these defendants presents such an unacceptable risk of
prejudice to both of them as to require separate trials, it is now

ORDERED that the defendants' motions for severance are granted to the
extent that the trials of the charges as to each defendant will be
conducted separately, and it is

FURTHER ORDERED that the first named defendant, Timothy McVeigh, will
be tried first, and it is

FURTHER ORDERED that all pre-trial proceedings and motions hearings,
unless otherwise expressly ordered, shall continue to be heard
jointly. Dated: October 25th, 1996

BY THE COURT:

/s/ Richard Matsch, Chief Judge


APPENDIX

LIMITING INSTRUCTION AT TIME OF WITNESS TESTIMONY

This case is really two trials in one. In one case you are asked to
judge whether the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that
Timothy McVeigh is guilty of each of the charges in the indictment. In
the other case you are asked to decide whether the government has
proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Terry Lynn Nichols is guilty of
each of the charges in the indictment. Obviously, both men are here on
trial together, but you must give separate consideration to each of
them just as you would if they were being tried separately.

Thus far, all [most] of the evidence you have heard has been
admissible against both defendants. You may consider that evidence
when you separately consider the proof against each defendant. That is
about to change The next witness will testify about statements Mr.
Nichols allegedly made to the FBI. This witness's testimony is not
admissible against Mr. McVeigh. You must limit consideration of this
witness's testimony to Mr. Nichols.

Under no circumstances may you consider this witness's testimony in
this case against Mr. McVeigh. If Mr. McVeigh were being tried
separately, this evidence could not be offered. A jury at a separate
trial for Mr. McVeigh would not even hear the evidence. You will hear
the evidence of course, but you must totally ignore it when you
consider the evidence against Mr. McVeigh. Indeed, because this
testimony cannot be considered evidence against Mr. McVeigh, his
counsel will not need to crossexamine this next witness.

You may consider Mr. Nichols' statements to the FBI only as evidence
of his own activities and his personal knowledge and state of mind. I
anticipate that the government may ask you to find that certain of Mr.
Nichols' statements were true but that others were false and that the
alleged falsity suggests a consciousness of guilt on Mr. Nichols'
part. Whether or not there is evidence of false statements, whether
any such evidence points to a consciousness of guilt, and the
significance, if any, to be attached to such evidence, are matters
exclusively within the province of the jury as the sole judges of the
facts of this case. I caution you, however, that consciousness of
guilty, if any, is based on personal knowledge and circumstances. Any
testimony concerning a false exculpatory statement by Mr. Nichols is
in no way attributable to Mr. McVeigh and may not be considered by you
in determining whether the government has proven the charges against
Mr. McVeigh beyond a reasonable doubt.

I repeat that under no circumstances are you to consider Mr. Nichols,
FBI statements, whether you find them to be true or false, in your
deliberations against Mr. McVeigh. Consideration of those statements
in the case against Mr. McVeigh would violate not only Mr. McVeigh's
constitutional rights but also your oaths and responsibilities as
jurors. (Footnotes omitted.)

Limiting Instruction At Close of Case

[Repeat the essence of the charge proposed above and add the
following.]

As a matter of law, you may not consider the testimony about Mr.
Nichols' statements to the FBI agents in your deliberations about Mr.
McVeigh. There is one obvious way for you to conduct your
deliberations to make it easier for you to abide by that rule That is
to deliberate first as to whether the government has proved its case
against Mr. McVeigh beyond a reasonable doubt. in this part of your
deliberations, you could consider evidence admitted against Mr.
McVeigh, but you could not consider in any way the evidence about Mr.
Nichols' statements to the FBI agents. Once you conclude your
deliberations as to Mr. McVeigh, you could then consider the charges
against Mr. Nichols In that part of your deliberations, and only in
that part, you could consider the evidence of Mr. Nichols' statements
to the FBI agents.

This is only a suggestion about the order in which you consider the
charges against the defendants; you are free to structure your
deliberations as you think best. But whatever order you decide to use
in considering the charges, you must not rely in any way on the
evidence of Mr. Nichols' statements to the FBI agents in deciding
whether the government has proved the charges against Mr. McVeigh
beyond a reasonable doubt.

                                                                 3







 1   begin with the entry of appearances.



 2            The Government?



 3            MR. HARTZLER:  Good morning, your Honor.



 4            THE COURT:  Mr. Hartzler.



 5            MR. HARTZLER:  Joe Hartzler.  With me at counsel table



 6   is Sean Connelly, Larry Mackey, Pat Ryan, Vicki Behenna, Scott



 7   Mendeloff, and Beth Wilkinson.



 8            For the benefit of the court reporter, we'll probably



 9   be switching seats at the break.



10            THE COURT:  I'm glad to see Mr. Ryan is back after



11   your unfortunate accident.



12            MR. RYAN:  Thank you.



13            THE COURT:  And for the defendant Mr. McVeigh,



14   Mr. Jones?



15            MR. JONES:  May it please the Court, the defendant is



16   present in court; and to my right is Mr. Rob Nigh, Ms. Jeralyn



17   Merritt, Mr. Richard Burr, Mr. Bob Wyatt.



18            THE COURT:  And for Mr. Nichols?  Mr. Tigar?



19            MR. TIGAR:  Michael Tigar.  Terry Nichols is in court.



20   At counsel table are Reid Neureiter, Adam Thurschwell and



21   Ronald Woods.



22            THE COURT:  Thank you.



23            MR. TIGAR:  If your Honor please, pursuant to a



24   stipulation with the Government, the witnesses we intend to



25   tender to the Court are present in the court.  I wanted to make







                                                                 4





1   sure that your Honor had no objection to that practice.  They



2   are expert witnesses, and we thought it would move things along



3   more quickly if they were here in court.



4            THE COURT:  I'm in agreement with that.  So that's



5   acceptable.



6            And we will, because there are witnesses involved,



7   proceed first with the defendants' motions for severance for



8   prejudicial joinder under -- or prejudice under Rule 14.  And



9   Mr. Tigar, are you going to proceed first on that?



10            MR. TIGAR:  Yes, your Honor.  We call Bryan Stevenson.



11            THE COURT:  Mr. Kelley, why are you standing up?



12            MR. TIGAR:  I'm sorry.



13            MR. KELLEY:  I apologize to Mr. Tigar.



14            Your Honor, I'm standing up to ask to be excused until



15   the Court gets to the matter on which the Court has indicated



16   it would hear the media.



17            THE COURT:  Yes.  I -- you're speaking now to which



18   motion by the media?  The unsealing of parts of the record



19   involving the motions for severance?



20            MR. KELLEY:  Yes, sir.  To my understanding, that's



21   the only matter on which the Court is now hearing from the



22   media.



23            THE COURT:  Yes.  On the other matter which will be



24   heard later, you've got my order, I assume, with respect to the



25   submission of amici brief?







                                            5







1            MR. KELLEY:  I do.



2            THE COURT:  Yes.  Well, stay in touch.  We may reach



3   that later today.



4            MR. KELLEY:  I'll be available.



5            THE COURT:  All right.  You're excused then.



6            Go ahead, Mr. Tigar.  I missed your statement about



7   who the witness is.



8            MR. TIGAR:  I'm sorry.  We call Bryan Stevenson.



9            THE COURT:  All right.  If you'll come forward and be



10   sworn, sir.



11            THE COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Raise your right hand.



12       (Bryan Stevenson was sworn by affirmation.)



13            THE COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Please have a seat.



14            Please state your full name for the record and spell



15   your last name.



16            THE WITNESS:  It's Bryan, B-R-Y-A-N, Stevenson,



17   S-T-E-V-E-N-S-O-N.



18                         DIRECT EXAMINATION



19   BY MR. TIGAR:



20   Q.  What do you do for work, Mr. Stevenson?



21   A.  I'm an attorney.



22   Q.  Where did you go to law school, sir?



23   A.  I graduated from Harvard Law School.



24   Q.  In what year?



25   A.  1985.







                                            6



    Bryan Stevenson - Direct



1   Q.  After graduating from Harvard Law School, what kind of work



2   did you do and where?



3   A.  I joined a nonprofit organization in Atlanta, Georgia, now



4   called the Southern Center for Human Rights, and represented



5   death row prisoners and capital defendants in the Deep South.



6   Q.  After you left the Southern Center for Human Rights in



7   Atlanta, what job did you have?



8   A.  I was at the Southern Center in Atlanta for four years, and



9   then I went to Montgomery, Alabama, where I became the director



10   of the Alabama Capital Representation Resource Center.



11   Q.  After the Resource Center closed -- was that 1995 --



12   A.  Yes.



13   Q.  -- what have you been doing?



14   A.  We created a new project called the Equal Justice



15   Initiative of Alabama; and I'm currently the director of that



16   organization, also an organization providing representation to



17   death row prisoners and capital defendants.



18   Q.  How many capital cases have you tried to verdict, sir?



19   A.  At the trial level, I've been involved in nine cases to



20   termination.



21   Q.  And in appellate and post-conviction review, how many cases



22   have you been involved in as counsel?



23   A.  I don't have an exact number, but it's four or five dozen.



24   Q.  And in connection with your work in appellate cases, do you



25   have a practice of interviewing jurors?







                                            7



    Bryan Stevenson - Direct



1   A.  Certainly, in our practice, in post-conviction work -- that



2   is, in state and federal collateral challenges -- we make it a



3   practice to interview jurors in every case.  I have four other



4   lawyers working with me.  We've handled 30 or 40 of those cases



5   in the last five years, so we've interviewed jurors in each of



6   those cases.



7            MR. TIGAR:  Your Honor, we're tendering Mr. Stevenson



8   as an expert on the problems of case management in capital



9   cases.



10            THE COURT:  Any questions or objection?



11            MR. RYAN:  We have no objection to his qualification



12   in that area.  I didn't realize that was what the subject of



13   this hearing was about.  It's a question of whether there



14   should be a severance or not.  I haven't heard anything from



15   this witness that would indicate to me that he's an expert in



16   matters of joinder or severance, either one.



17            THE COURT:  Well, I don't know who is, except for me.



18            MR. TIGAR:  I think I'm looking at the expert that I'm



19   trying to speak to most persuasively, your Honor.



20            THE COURT:  Well, you may proceed.



21            MR. TIGAR:  I want --



22   BY MR. TIGAR:



23   Q.  Well, let me get to it, then.  Mr. Stevenson, do you think



24   that it is possible in a highly publicized case involving



25   allegations of an extremely aggravated crime in which the claim







                                            8



    Bryan Stevenson - Direct



1   is made that the defendants have differing kinds of involvement



2   that the defendants can receive a fair trial when the



3   Government is seeking the death penalty as to both?



4   A.  No.  I think it's problematic in any capital case; and for



5   me, the issue is driven by the unique nature of a capital



6   trial.  I think it's problematic in any case.



7            I think in a highly aggravated case where there is a



8   great deal of pretrial publicity, it becomes impossible; and



9   that deals primarily with the challenge that defense lawyers



10   have in a capital trial to get the jury focused on the



11   defendant, the character of the defendant.  The penalty phase



12   of a capital trial is not just about the circumstances of the



13   crime, where there is some common evidence; but it's also about



14   the character of this defendant, getting the jury focused on



15   whether this particular defendant's life has purpose, has



16   value, even accepting that they were involved in a highly



17   aggravated crime.



18            This challenge, which I think all defense lawyers face



19   in a penalty phase, of trying to get the jury to understand



20   that even though this person may be guilty of a capital crime,



21   there is still some redemptive potential here, there is still



22   some hope here -- it's very difficult.  And when that gets



23   intertwined with somebody else's story and you have to tell the



24   story to get the jury to appreciate that -- when it gets



25   intertwined with somebody else's story, I think it's very







                                            9



    Bryan Stevenson - Direct



1   difficult to provide that defendant with a fair consideration



2   of his or her unique circumstances toward making a judgment



3   about life or death.



4   Q.  Well, I want to start, then, sir -- if we start with the



5   penalty phase or the capital nature of the trial as a given --



6   and let us take as a given that we have jury sentencing under a



7   weighing statute, which -- you've had experience with those



8   kind of situations?



9   A.  That's correct.



10   Q.  Let's look at the phases of the case and talk about some of



11   those practical difficulties.  What are the difficulties that



12   would arise in voir dire?



13   A.  Well, trying a capital case is like trying two cases



14   simultaneously.  And until you've been in the situation of



15   having to think about your mitigation and penalty phase defense



16   at the same time of your guilt phase defense, it's kind of hard



17   to kind of see this stuff.



18            But it starts in voir dire.  In a capital case, there



19   will be death qualification; that is, you'll be engaged in voir 



20   dire where you're asking prospective jurors about their



21   opinions related to the death penalty.  Under federal law, if



22   the juror has a moral or religious opposition to the death



23   penalty and can't consider that, that juror is subject to



24   excusal for cause.



25            The defense lawyer's obligation in this area is not







                                            10



    Bryan Stevenson - Direct



1   only to simply inquire about death qualification but also life



2   qualification; that is Morgan vs. Illinois and the Supreme



3   Court cases hold that a juror cannot serve on a capital trial



4   unless that juror is prepared to also consider a sentence of



5   life imprisonment.  There are a lot of people who believe in an



6   eye for an eye; and their view is if you kill somebody, you



7   must die.  Well, that kind of person under Morgan is not



8   qualified to serve.



9            Talking to the jurors about their ability to even



10   accept that somebody might be guilty of the crime charged but



11   still be able to consider a sentence of life is difficult; and



12   you want to sensitize them to the potential mitigation



13   evidence.  You want to sensitize them to the anticipated story



14   that you're going to tell about your client; and that's very



15   difficult in any case.  It's particularly difficult when your



16   story is again being undermined or intertwined with somebody



17   else's story, and your ability to decide whether a prospective



18   juror can actually respond to the mitigation you expect to



19   present is again very much threatened by a joint trial.



20   Q.  Now, let's move into the presentation of evidence in the



21   guilt phase.  In the guilt phase, is a capital trial different



22   from a trial in which the Government is not seeking the death



23   penalty?  And if so, can you tell us based on your experience



24   how?



25   A.  It is different in that your guilt phase presentation has







                                            11



    Bryan Stevenson - Direct



1   to be aware of the possibility that there could be a penalty



2   phase.  And therefore, what we've learned in our juror



3   interviews in post-conviction work is that jurors are very



4   sensitive about consistent theories.  They resent defendants



5   coming in on an alibi defense and then saying well, we lied to



6   you at the guilt phase, but now let us tell you what really



7   happened at the penalty phase.  And a defense has to work



8   through these very difficult strategic questions about how to



9   present the case in a way where there is still some credibility



10   left at the penalty phase.



11            And so the presentation of the case at the guilt phase



12   has to keep in mind that there is a chance that your verdict --



13   that your judgment is not going to be what you want and that



14   you're still going to have to get these jurors to accept you



15   and believe you when you say my client's life still has some



16   purpose, my client is more than the worst thing he has done;



17   and getting them to understand and go with you when you start



18   talking about how you need them to accept this idea that each



19   of us is more than the worst thing you've ever done:  If you



20   tell a lie, you're not just a liar; if you steal something



21   you're not just a thief; if you kill somebody, you're not just



22   a killer, and we want to talk to you about how my client is



23   more than just a killer.  We want to focus on that before you



24   decide whether their life is worth taking or worth saving.



25            That whole credibility process, that whole strategic







                                            12



    Bryan Stevenson - Direct



1   approach to capital litigation, has to start in the guilt



2   phase.



3   Q.  Is there a difference between a capital trial and a non-



4   capital trial with respect to proposed lesser included



5   offenses -- and I'm looking now and asking you hypothetically,



6   because we're not to get into the facts that are under seal --



7   a case in which the alleged involvement of the defendants is



8   very different?



9   A.  Yes.  Absolutely.  The most strangely appealing defense for



10   many capital defendants involves getting the jury focused on a



11   lesser included theory.  I mean, the whole case law,



12   particularly in my jurisdiction of Alabama, has really emerged



13   to protect this critical function.  Beck vs. Alabama, the case



14   that came out of our state when jurors were precluded from



15   considering lesser included offenses, was such a setback for



16   defense lawyers because they did not have the option of getting



17   jurors focused on some degree of culpability but not the degree



18   that would warrant moving the case into a phase where the



19   defendant -- where the jury would be asked to take the



20   defendant's life.



21            So absolutely, it's a very common defense, it's a very



22   important option for jurors to have in a capital case,



23   particularly where there are co-defendants and disputes about



24   the degree of culpability.



25   Q.  In the Deep South where you have spent your working life,







                                            13



    Bryan Stevenson - Direct



1   is there a working hypothesis about whether capital cases



2   should be tried separately or jointly?



3   A.  Oh, absolutely.



4   Q.  What is that working hypothesis?



5   A.  That hypothesis is that capital cases are tried separately.



6   We have 150 people on death row in my state of Alabama, only



7   two of whom were tried in a joint trial.  They were



8   co-defendants in the same trial.  They did not object to the



9   state's effort to consolidate the trial.



10            I consult on cases all across the Deep South:



11   Mississippi, Georgia, Florida.



12   Q.  How many people on death row in Mississippi?



13   A.  50.  110 in Georgia.  It is absolutely the exception and



14   not the norm that cases would be tried jointly.  In fact, I've



15   never worked -- consulted with lawyers who were forced to take



16   a case in a consolidated way because of precisely these kinds



17   of issues.



18   Q.  Now, moving on to the problems that would arise in the



19   penalty phase of a joint trial, again, in our hypothetically



20   highly publicized, alleged-aggravated-crime, alleged-different-



21   involvement case, what barriers do you see in your experience



22   to a fair jury consideration in a jury sentencing weighing



23   statute jurisdiction such as the federal courts?



24   A.  Well, again, the penalty phase will be about reinforcing



25   for the jury their obligation to consider the character of the







                                            14



    Bryan Stevenson - Direct



1   offender, the life of the offender.



2            We accept that the circumstances of the offense are



3   aggravated, or we wouldn't be at the penalty phase in the first



4   place.  Now the law requires the jurors to do something very



5   difficult, which is to nonetheless consider that despite that



6   aggravated crime, this person could be properly sentenced to



7   life.



8            Well, to get jurors to do that, you really do have to



9   talk to the jurors about this person's life.  It's a life



10   story.  It's a history.



11            You have to be willing to talk in very personal and



12   specific terms about the unique circumstances of this



13   particular defendant so that the jury can consider the fact



14   that despite this aggravated crime, death is not the



15   appropriate punishment.



16            When you're telling that story, it's difficult enough



17   because again, I think the presumption is that we think about



18   punishment in relation to crime, in relation to conduct, not in



19   relation to the individuals at question.  The law gives us the



20   opportunity to force jurors to consider the individual in



21   question, but it's a difficult challenge.



22            When that challenge is confused and compromised and



23   undermined by somebody else's story, I think it becomes very



24   difficult for a jury to do the kind of weighing of mitigating



25   circumstances and aggravating circumstances that the law







                                            15



    Bryan Stevenson - Direct



1   compels.



2   Q.  Would the problem be more difficult when the mitigators



3   that are presented and the aggravators that are presented are



4   different as to the two or more defendants in a joint



5   proceeding?



6   A.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  The -- I think there is a -- what



7   we've experienced in talking to jurors in post-conviction work



8   is a very strong sentiment that there should be consistency



9   among punishment for the same kind of crime; that is, jurors



10   will say we felt like if one did it, the -- both did it, then



11   both should be sentenced similarly.



12            It reflects, in my view, a misunderstanding about the



13   importance of giving individualized sentencing attention to



14   each offender, but it's a very powerful instinct on the part of



15   jurors.  It seems somehow inequitable or unfair to have



16   different sentences for the same conduct.  But that's what the



17   law compels.



18            So yes, it becomes very difficult when the aggravators



19   and the mitigators are different as to particular defendants.



20   It's also very, very difficult in cases involving a great deal



21   of pretrial publicity.  There tends to be sort of a presumption



22   that whoever committed this crime deserves the death penalty.



23   And the more publicized the crime and the more common that



24   presumption, the more widespread that presumption, I think the



25   more difficult it is for jurors to kind of really focus on the







                                            16



    Bryan Stevenson - Direct



1   fact that they alone, the 12 people in that box, are going to



2   be the only people to hear this unique life story, this unique



3   life history about this person, and be forced to consider the



4   character of this offender and the circumstances of this



5   individual before coming to sentencing judgment.



6            It's a very difficult and I think not widely



7   understood challenge that it's hard to get jurors focused and I



8   think doubly hard when two stories are going at once.



9   Q.  In your interviews with jurors in the dozens of cases in



10   which you have talked to them, is there a difference, a broad



11   gauge difference between the focus of jurors who voted for life



12   and the focus of jurors who voted for death?



13   A.  Oh, yes.  I mean, invariably, those jurors who vote for



14   life are jurors who can tell you about the defendant in



15   personal terms, who can talk about circumstances of that



16   defendant's life, who can tell you -- who remember the issues



17   around mental health evidence or emotional evidence, who could



18   talk about the defendant's history of abuse, if that's a part



19   of the case, who could talk about the pressures that defendant



20   was dealing with at the time of the crime.



21            It's interesting because they've remembered those



22   things quite well, and those are the things they talk to you



23   about when you go and interview them.



24            Jurors who come back with death sentences invariably



25   talk about the crime.  They talk about how aggravated the crime







                                            17



    Bryan Stevenson - Direct



1   was, the circumstances of the crime, and usually are very



2   reluctant to say much about the defendant, usually because they



3   don't remember very much.  They haven't been allowed to focus



4   very much on those defendants.  And those are the differences



5   you see between jurors who voted for life and voted for death.



6            MR. TIGAR:  Thank you, very much, Mr. Stevenson.



7            THE COURT:  Mr. Ryan?



8                          CROSS-EXAMINATION



9   BY MR. RYAN:



10   Q.  Good morning, Mr. Stevenson.



11   A.  Good morning.



12   Q.  Would it be fair to say, sir, that you are an outspoken



13   critic of the death penalty?



14   A.  It's no secret that I oppose the death penalty.  I think



15   it's applied unfairly.



16   Q.  And in fact you not only have that belief, but you've



17   spoken about that belief on many, many occasions.



18   A.  Sure.



19   Q.  And you've written about that belief?



20   A.  Yes.



21   Q.  You've been on television about that belief?



22   A.  That's correct.



23   Q.  And you have lectured in various contexts about



24   difficulties that you have with the way capital punishment is



25   imposed in the Deep South?







                                            18



    Bryan Stevenson - Cross



1   A.  That's correct.



2   Q.  You have criticized the racial bias, for example, that you



3   believe exists in the Deep South?



4   A.  That's correct.



5   Q.  You have criticized the manner in which defense counsel are



6   paid and selected?



7   A.  Yes, in some jurisdictions, that's correct.



8   Q.  You have criticized the preparedness, if you will, of



9   defense counsel?



10   A.  Quite often, yes.



11   Q.  Yes.  You have criticized the manner, the speed at which a



12   trial proceeds and the failure of defense counsel to present



13   mitigating evidence and circumstances.



14   A.  Yes.  In some jurisdictions, that's correct.



15   Q.  And in those instances where you've interviewed many jurors



16   and they have not remembered individual facts about the



17   defendant and they voted for death, those were also cases



18   frequently where there was little, if any, mitigating



19   circumstances presented by relatively incompetent defense



20   counsel?



21   A.  In some cases, not in all.



22   Q.  You have criticized the manner in which peremptory



23   challenges are utilized in the Deep South?



24   A.  With reference to racial discrimination, yes.



25   Q.  Yes, sir.







                                            19



    Bryan Stevenson - Cross



1   A.  Uh-huh.



2   Q.  Prosecutors peremptorily challenging all of the black



3   jurors, for example, on a given panel?



4   A.  That's correct.



5   Q.  You have criticized the racial attitudes of defense counsel



6   and judges in various cases; is that correct?



7   A.  Yes.  In evidence -- when there is evidence of racial bias



8   on the part of particular lawyers, prosecutors or defense



9   lawyers, we've made an issue of that.



10   Q.  And the testimony you've given in various habeas



11   proceedings with respect to trial matters or strategies



12   frequently, if not always, involve these kinds of situations



13   that we've been speaking of, where you've had an inadequately



14   prepared defense counsel.  I think in one case you talked about



15   defense counsel who was drunk at trial.



16   A.  That's correct.



17   Q.  Those kinds of problems.



18   A.  It's a range of problems; but inadequate preparation in



19   capital cases in the Deep South is a very big problem that we



20   speak to a great deal.



21   Q.  Now, none of these problems which you have testified to in



22   the past exist in this case, do they?



23   A.  No.  I would presume that these defendants will get very



24   good representation; but I would not frankly suggest that the



25   fairness problems that we encounter in our cases in the Deep







                                            20



    Bryan Stevenson - Cross



1   South are any different here.  Any time you have basically a



2   very publicized crime where there is a great deal of public



3   hostility toward the defendants, there is the risk that an



4   effort will be made to minimize the risk of acquittal or a



5   sentence less than death.  And that's the circumstance that



6   gives rise to unfairness creeping into these proceedings.



7   Q.  But that wasn't my question.  My question was:  Do any of



8   the problems that you have testified to about and in which you



9   have been so vocal about and which you are knowledgeable about



10   that we've just gone over -- none of those exist in this case,



11   do they?  We don't have elected judges here.  We don't have



12   black defendants and white victims.  We don't have drunk -- or



13   don't anticipate that either Mr. Jones or Mr. Tigar or their



14   colleagues will be drunk in court.  They've certainly shown



15   every indication of preparedness at every step of these



16   proceedings, as much as it pains me to compliment them.  Those



17   kinds of problems which you have testified about -- they don't



18   exist here.



19   A.  That's right, Mr. Ryan.  And it's certainly true that many



20   of the problems that I testify about that I confront in my



21   cases are not existing here:  Quality of counsel, perhaps some



22   of the race issues, some of those other issues.  But we also



23   talk about in our cases fairness, making sure that the



24   procedures are not pushed by public desires for a particular



25   judgment, making sure the procedures do not undermine the







                                            21



    Bryan Stevenson - Cross



1   defendant's right to present his or her story free from



2   presumption or bias.



3            I think the risk of unfairness is no different,



4   frankly -- it's a different kind of problem, but it's the same



5   issue, which is making sure that we recognize that defendants



6   are presumed innocent and that they have a fair chance to tell



7   their story in the face of these kinds of aggravated charges.



8   Q.  Do you have any doubt that this court will not try in every



9   way to protect these rights that you're concerned about?



10   A.  Oh, no.  I have great confidence in the Court.  The very



11   nature of this proceeding speaks I think well of the Court's



12   willingness to consider carefully the importance of protecting



13   individual rights in these trials.



14   Q.  And you realize that we are here on the defense motions to



15   sever --



16   A.  I'm sorry.



17   Q.  You realize that we are here today on the defense motions



18   to sever these defendants at trial?



19   A.  That's correct.



20   Q.  Have you ever testified on the subject of joint trials and



21   the need for severance?



22   A.  No.



23   Q.  Have you ever published any articles on this subject?



24   A.  No.



25   Q.  Have you ever filed a severance motion?







                                            22



    Bryan Stevenson - Cross



1   A.  No.



2   Q.  In fact, one of the -- the case at least I associate you



3   most with is the McMillan case.



4   A.  Uh-huh.



5   Q.  You've testified about that case on a number of occasions.



6   A.  That's correct.



7   Q.  That was a case in which you were successful in



8   establishing, following the trial, that the defendant was in



9   fact innocent of the crime?



10   A.  That's correct.



11   Q.  In that case, the -- Mr. McMillan was joined with another



12   defendant, was he not, at the trial?



13   A.  No, not at trial.  They had separate trials.  As I said --



14   Q.  A joint -- it was jointly charged, but the judge severed



15   the cases.



16   A.  That's correct.



17   Q.  And Mr. McMillan nonetheless received the death penalty?



18   A.  That's correct.



19   Q.  You said that you had tried nine capital cases.  Were you



20   the first-chair primary defense counsel in those cases?



21   A.  Yes.



22   Q.  Were these all in Georgia or Alabama, or where?



23   A.  Most were in Alabama.



24   Q.  Have you -- I take it from your testimony that none of



25   these cases involve joint trial where there were joined







                                            23



    Bryan Stevenson - Cross



1   defendants?



2   A.  No.  As I said, that's extremely rare in the Deep South.



3   Q.  Have you ever tried any kind of a case, whether it be



4   capital or otherwise, in which there were joined defendants?



5   A.  At the trial level, no.



6   Q.  Is it fair to say, then, that you really have limited or no



7   trial experience with the types of issues that frequently arise



8   in joint criminal trials, such as Bruton issues and



9   antagonistic defenses?



10   A.  Well, I guess it really depends on what you think are the



11   relevant issues.  We obviously deal with claims of co-defendant



12   testimony in separate trials in the same way that you deal with



13   them in a joint trial; but I have not tried at the trial level



14   a consolidated case with multiple defendants.



15   Q.  I am curious about your testimony -- maybe I didn't



16   understand it correctly -- that you indicated that you felt a



17   jury in a joint trial based on your conversations with jurors,



18   I thought, presumed that the joined defendants would receive



19   the same punishment.  Did I understand your testimony



20   correctly?



21   A.  I guess what I was trying to say is that there is a general



22   presumption which defense lawyer must combat and overcome that



23   many people have -- and jurors are people -- that punishment



24   should be consistent, should be the same, without reference to



25   the fact that Eighth Amendment law, at least in death penalty







                                            24



    Bryan Stevenson - Cross



1   cases, allows a defendant to talk about his or her situation,



2   accepting involvement in a crime that oftentimes is difficult



3   for jurors to get to.



4   Q.  So did I misunderstand that you based that statement of



5   yours on conversations with jurors?



6   A.  Yes.  I mean that's -- that -- I base that on conversations



7   with jurors we've interviewed in post-conviction proceedings



8   but with prospective jurors in voir dire, people who deal with



9   these issues in a variety of contexts.  It's not a difficult



10   sentiment to get out of folks when you talk to them.



11   Q.  But none of these people have ever been faced with the task



12   of assessing capital punishment or sentencing in a joint trial?



13   A.  No.  None of the jurors that we have interviewed were



14   actually jurors in a consolidated trial.  That's correct.



15   Again, it's a very rare event in our jurisdiction.



16   Q.  And as I understand, your primary focus of your testimony



17   is your concern about the jurors giving the Supreme Court's



18   required individualized consideration to joined defendants.



19   A.  Well, I guess it's more than that.  I think it's the



20   jurors' ability to hear the story and then give adequate



21   consideration to that story as it relates to one particular



22   defendant; but it's also the defendant's opportunity to tell



23   that story fairly, to tell that story effectively.  I think



24   it's difficult to tell the story in the best of circumstances



25   when the whole 12 jurors are focused on you.  I think it







                                            25



    Bryan Stevenson - Cross



1   becomes even more difficult when you don't even get that kind



2   of undivided attention and focus and your story is mixed in



3   with somebody else's, the presumption being that a lot of



4   people think you can just rotely apply aggravating



5   circumstances and mitigating circumstances and come to a



6   judgment by going down some kind of queue.



7            I think effective defense lawyers in this area reject



8   that approach and get jurors to try to appreciate that this is



9   about their client, their client's life, their client's



10   history, their client's background, their client's



11   circumstances, the value of that life, the purpose of that



12   life; and that's a very difficult thing to do in any proceeding



13   but I think doubly difficult in a proceeding where it's not



14   about your client's life.



15   Q.  And the better the defense counsel is, the better



16   opportunity for that individualized consideration?



17   A.  No question.



18   Q.  And I take it you know Michael Tigar?



19   A.  Yes.



20   Q.  Did you know him prior to today or yesterday?



21   A.  Not really.  We met -- I know of him.  We've been on the



22   circuit together from time to time.



23   Q.  What does it mean to be on the circuit?



24   A.  I've lectured at training programs where he's also



25   lectured.







                                            26



    Bryan Stevenson - Cross



1   Q.  And you're certainly familiar with his reputation?



2   A.  Absolutely.



3   Q.  I take it you're familiar with the types of cases he has



4   handled in the past?



5   A.  That's correct.



6   Q.  And you're at least generally familiar with his experience



7   in capital litigation?



8   A.  That's correct.



9   Q.  I take it you regard him as extremely competent counsel?



10   A.  Yes.



11   Q.  I take it you take it as a sign of extreme fairness of this



12   court --



13            MR. TIGAR:  Your Honor, I'm willing to stipulate to



14   all of this.



15            MR. RYAN:  Your Honor, I can't tell you how this



16   examination pains me, but nonetheless it is directly relevant



17   to his testimony, and I'd like to continue with it briefly.



18   BY MR. RYAN:



19   Q.  You know him as an exceedingly competent counsel; correct?



20   A.  Yes.



21   Q.  Are you familiar with Mr. Jones' reputation?



22   A.  Generally, yes.



23   Q.  And I take it you would regard him as extremely competent



24   counsel?



25   A.  Yes, I would.







                                            27



    Bryan Stevenson - Cross



1   Q.  And I think -- I take it you would say it speaks very well



2   for the federal system that federal courts have appointed



3   counsel of this quality to represent these two co-defendants?



4   A.  Yes.



5   Q.  Let me back up a second, a moment, to something you said



6   earlier about this feeling that jurors were going to give the



7   same punishment in every case.



8            Have you looked at any actual cases where joint



9   defendants were tried to see what the outcome was?



10   A.  Again, the only joint case we've had in the jurisdiction



11   where I've worked, the defendants were convicted and sentenced



12   to death.



13   Q.  Are you familiar with Gibson vs. State, 555 S.2d 784, 1984,



14   an Alabama case?



15   A.  Not a death case.



16   Q.  One defendant got life and one got less?



17   A.  That's correct.



18   Q.  Joint capital case?



19   A.  Pardon me?



20   Q.  Joint capital case?



21   A.  It did not advance to the penalty phase of a capital



22   proceeding, though.  Neither defendant advanced to the penalty



23   phase of a capital case.



24   Q.  Have you looked at any of the federal cases that have gone



25   to trial to see whether or not there was a difference in







                                            28



    Bryan Stevenson - Cross



1   whether joined defendants were more likely to get the death



2   penalty than life?



3   A.  Not carefully, no.  I'm aware that there have been people



4   who have been sentenced to life in joint proceedings and people



5   who have been sentenced to death in joint proceedings.  That



6   doesn't surprise me.



7   Q.  It does run contra to what you said, though, about a jury



8   wanting to impose identical punishments?



9   A.  No.  I think frankly it depends on the case.  I think in



10   less aggravated cases, you can overcome the problems inherent



11   in a joint trial.  In cases where the defenses are not



12   dissimilar, where both defendants are together and are using



13   the same alibi defense and the same alibi witnesses and whole



14   focus of the trial is about their noninvolvement or some degree



15   of involvement that is equally nonculpable as a capital crime,



16   I think these barriers and burdens can be overcome.  I don't



17   think it's impossible in every case.



18            I think in aggravated cases, though, like this and in



19   cases where the need to make the story at the penalty phase is



20   going to be even more personal because of the highly aggravated



21   nature, it becomes extremely difficult.



22   Q.  Are you aware that the prosecution contends that



23   Mr. McVeigh was the person who delivered the bomb to the Murrah



24   Building that killed 168 people?



25   A.  Yes.







                                            29



    Bryan Stevenson - Cross



1   Q.  And are you aware of the fact that the Nichols defense



2   contends that Mr. Nichols was in Kansas at the time?



3   A.  Yes.



4   Q.  Would you not regard that --



5            MR. TIGAR:  Excuse me, your Honor.  That -- I believe



6   the Government concedes that Mr. Nichols was in Kansas at the



7   time.



8            MR. RYAN:  May I continue, your Honor?  That's not an



9   objection.



10            MR. TIGAR:  I object to the question, your Honor.



11   It -- to the extent it's a hypothetical question, it's



12   unrelated to the evidence --



13            THE COURT:  But it is inappropriate through an



14   objection to ask for a stipulation.  He is using the defense



15   that has been suggested to the Government; correct?



16            MR. TIGAR:  If your Honor please, the Government



17   concedes that Mr. Nichols was in Kansas at the time; therefore,



18   there is no good faith basis for that question.



19            THE COURT:  Well, the objection is overruled.



20   BY MR. RYAN:



21   Q.  The point being, Mr. Stevenson, you would agree that there



22   is a vast difference between the actions of two defendants



23   where one delivers a bomb to the Murrah Building killing 168



24   people and another defendant is in a different state at the



25   time.  That shouldn't be a fact that is confusing to a jury,







                                            30



    Bryan Stevenson - Cross



1   should it?



2   A.  I think it really depends on how -- what the Government's



3   theory is as to why both defendants are equally guilty of the



4   same crime.  I mean I think those facts certainly speak to



5   different approaches; but I don't know that they help the jury



6   necessarily come to different conclusions or to -- about the



7   verdict.



8   Q.  We don't think they do.  My question is:  Do you think that



9   the jury will have any difficulty understanding the differences



10   in the roles between these two defendants on April 19, 1995?



11   A.  In a joint trial?



12   Q.  Yes.



13   A.  I think that in a case where there are different defenses,



14   different theories of defense, disputes among the defendants



15   about the evidence and about their culpability, the burden on



16   the jury grows greater; that is, if both defendants were



17   alleging precisely the same defense, alibi or whatever, then I



18   think it would be less of an issue for the jury.



19            But again, driving -- I mean just so you're clear



20   about my perspective on this, my perspective on this is really



21   driven from the harder question of the penalty phase and the



22   need to develop that in the guilt phase.



23   Q.  All right.  Well, let's talk about that penalty phase for



24   just a brief second.



25   A.  Sure.







                                            31



    Bryan Stevenson - Cross



1   Q.  Do you feel that Mr. Tigar is incapable of demonstrating to



2   the jury the differences between his client and Mr. Jones'



3   client, Mr. McVeigh?



4   A.  I think in a case like this, it would be unfair for



5   Mr. Tigar or the best lawyer in the world to try to get the



6   jury to consider a sentence less than death without an



7   opportunity to talk exclusively about your defendant and the



8   unique circumstances of that defendant as it relates to an



9   appropriate punishment; in this case, arguably less than death.



10   Q.  That was not my question.  The question was:  Do you think



11   Mr. Tigar is incapable of distinguishing his client in the



12   penalty phase from Mr. McVeigh in terms of what mitigating



13   factors apply to Mr. Nichols?



14   A.  I think frankly yes, it would be unfair for any lawyer to



15   have to make that presentation in a joint trial with the



16   charges as aggravated as they are in this case, with the



17   pretrial publicity as it is in this case.  I don't think it's



18   about Mr. Tigar.  I think it's about the nature of the



19   proceeding.  I wouldn't want to be in that situation.  I



20   wouldn't presume to put him or anyone else in that situation.



21   Q.  You don't think that he can, through charts and through



22   testimony of witnesses, talk exclusively about Mr. Nichols?



23   A.  Oh, I have no doubt that he will do those things.



24   Q.  Yes?



25   A.  He will make as good a presentation as he possibly can on







                                            32



    Bryan Stevenson - Cross



1   behalf of Mr. Nichols about his life, his circumstances, etc.



2            The problem won't be, in my opinion, his ability to



3   make the presentation.  It will be the nature of the process.



4   It will be getting the jury focused, if you will, on the unique



5   circumstances of his client and coming to a judgment about his



6   client's life, not anybody else's life, his client.



7   Q.  And based on your practical experiences since you have none



8   in joint trials, you have no reason to think that that will not



9   be successful?



10   A.  Well, I guess my experience is really in generally trying



11   to get jurors to appreciate the need for an individualized



12   sentencing.  It's a problem in any case.  I think it's a double



13   problem in a case that's highly aggravated.  I think if you



14   create this kind of procedural obstacle to making that



15   presentation fairly, you're courting the kind of unfairness



16   that I guess, as you talked about my record in the past, I



17   would be subject to criticize.



18            MR. RYAN:  No further questions.



19            THE COURT:  Any redirect?



20                        REDIRECT EXAMINATION



21   BY MR. TIGAR:



22   Q.  Mr. Stevenson, one last question to clarify it:  Are the



23   problems made more difficult, the problems of individualized



24   consideration, when not only the Government but the



25   co-defendant is attempting to undercut the position that one







                                            33



   Bryan Stevenson - Redirect



1   defense counsel is presenting?



2   A.  Oh, absolutely.  It's almost, in some ways, having to deal



3   with three theories, which I think does add to the burden of



4   the defendant, does make it even more difficult to sensitize



5   the jury to the particular story you're trying to tell with



6   relation to mitigation; and I think given that the crime has



7   some commonality as to both defendants, it adds to the burden



8   of getting the jury to accept, look, we understand that there



9   are common facts about this crime that are related to both



10   defendants, but we now need you to understand that the judgment



11   as to penalty is unique to this individual.  It's about this



12   individual's life and history and circumstances.



13            Yes, I think it's complicated when you have a



14   co-defendant also introducing a theory.  That adds to, frankly,



15   the problems of getting the jury focused.



16            MR. TIGAR:  Thank you very much.



17            I have no further questions.



18            MR. RYAN:  None, your Honor.



19            THE COURT:  Thank you.  You may step down,



20   Mr. Stevenson.



21            MR. TIGAR:  May he be excused, your Honor?



22            THE COURT:  Agreed, Mr. Ryan, that he may be excused?



23            MR. RYAN:  Yes.



24            THE COURT:  You may be excused.



25            MR. WOODS:  Judge Charles Campbell.

9                         DIRECT EXAMINATION



10   BY MR. WOODS:



11   Q.  Judge, where do you live now?



12   A.  In Austin, Texas.



13   Q.  Where did you grow up and go to school?



14   A.  Basically, in Dallas.



15   Q.  Give the Court a brief summary of your educational



16   background.



17   A.  I went to undergraduate school at Southern Methodist



18   University in Dallas and also at the University of Texas at



19   Arlington.  I received a B.A. degree in political science in



20   1966 from the University of Texas at Arlington.  I went to law



21   school at Southern Methodist University, where I received a



22   J.D. degree in 1969.



23            In 1988, I enrolled in an LLM program at the



24   University of Virginia and received an LLM of judicial process



25   from the University of Virginia in 1990.







                                            35



   Charles Campbell - Direct



1   Q.  Would you give the Court the background of your



2   professional experience after law school at SMU?



3   A.  After law school, I started as a young prosecutor in



4   Houston in the grand jury section of the office and progressed



5   from there into the trial sections, the misdemeanor trial



6   section, the felony trial section and --



7   Q.  How many years did you work there in Harris County?



8   A.  Just about three years.



9   Q.  During those three years, which were pre-Furman, there were



10   a lot of murder cases that were capital murder cases.  Did you



11   sit as second chair on any capital murder cases during those



12   years?



13   A.  I sat as second chair on two or three capital murders, yes,



14   sir.



15   Q.  What did you next do after your three years at Harris



16   County district attorney's office?



17   A.  I then went and ran for county attorney of Hill County,



18   which is in Hillsboro, Texas, about, oh, 60 miles south of



19   Dallas, I suppose, and was elected to that post and served four



20   years in that post.



21   Q.  Would you relate to the Court what the jurisdiction of the



22   county attorney is under Texas law?



23   A.  It varies from county to county; but in that particular



24   county, it was to prosecute misdemeanors and also to handle



25   eminent domain and also to represent commissioners in court in







                                            36



   Charles Campbell - Direct



1   all civil matters involving the county.



2   Q.  Did you have an occasion as the county attorney to try



3   capital cases?



4   A.  I did.  The district attorney had not ever tried one, and I



5   had been involved in several in Houston; and so when they came



6   up in Hill County, he asked me if I would take the lead.  And I



7   took the lead for that four years at a salary of $14,000 a year



8   as county attorney.  I took the lead in at least three or four



9   capital cases.



10   Q.  What years were those, sir?



11   A.  That would have been from 1973 -- January 1 of '73 to



12   December 31 of 1976.



13   Q.  During that period, Furman was decided, Texas revised its



14   capital murder statute.  Would you briefly just relate to the



15   Court how Texas narrowed its murder cases to conform with



16   Furman so that not every murder case was a capital murder case?



17   A.  Basically, Texas did two things.  One was to try to create



18   a substantive crime of capital murder; that is, a murder



19   committed in the course of committing some other offense, such



20   as robbery, burglary, kidnapping, something that would, in



21   essence, take a murder case, an ordinary murder case and



22   aggravate it to a capital murder.



23            The second thing that the legislature did was to



24   propose at the punishment phase of a capital murder trial that



25   certain special issues be submitted to the jury to answer and







                                            37



   Charles Campbell - Direct



1   then depending upon the jury's answer to those questions would



2   depend on what the trial judge -- whether the trial judge would



3   sentence the defendant to life or to death.



4   Q.  After the four years as a county attorney occasionally



5   trying capital murder cases, what did you next do, sir?



6   A.  I then ran against the incumbent district attorney, whose



7   capital docket I was handling anyway, and defeated him and



8   began that particular job January 1 of 1977.



9   Q.  And while you were district attorney, did you have an



10   occasion to try any capital cases?



11   A.  I tried three or four, yes, sir.



12   Q.  Did you serve the full four-year term as district attorney?



13   A.  No, I did not.



14   Q.  Would you relate to the Court what you did before your



15   four-year term was up?



16   A.  I was offered a position by Mark White when he was elected



17   Attorney General in 1978 -- in the fall of 1978, to head up his



18   prosecutor's assistance division in Austin when he took office



19   January 1 of '79.  That would have been in the middle of my



20   term.



21            I accepted that position and resigned my position as



22   district attorney of Hill County.



23   Q.  Would you relate briefly to the Court what the nature of



24   your duties were heading up that prosecutor's assistance office



25   for the Attorney General as it relates to capital murder cases.







                                            38



   Charles Campbell - Direct



1   A.  The prosecutor's assistance division was basically



2   comprised of lawyers who had a fair amount of trial experience;



3   and our mission essentially was to go out and help the smaller



4   offices in the state of Texas that didn't have the resources,



5   the manpower, the money from their county commissioners,



6   whatever, to try complicated cases, not just capital cases but



7   official misconduct cases, white collar crime, complex



8   narcotics trafficking cases, things of that nature.



9            But capital cases is one of the things that we focused



10   on because that's where the biggest need was, especially in



11   rural areas where there just weren't the resources.



12   Q.  How many capital cases did you personally try while you



13   were in that position?



14   A.  I believe I personally tried three.



15   Q.  Did you supervise other lawyers in your office who were



16   trying the capital cases?



17   A.  Right.  We had, I think, about eight lawyers total.



18   Q.  Approximately how many cases were you supervising -- murder



19   cases -- during your time in the prosecutor assistance --



20   A.  I would say probably a half a dozen at any given time.



21   Q.  Was there one person in your office that did the majority



22   of the capital murder cases?



23   A.  A lady named Linda Walden, yes.



24   Q.  And did you sit second with her on some of the cases?



25   A.  I sat second with her.  She was fairly experienced, at







                                            39



   Charles Campbell - Direct



1   least insofar as the technical aspects of presenting evidence.



2   She was not as experienced in jury selection as I was; and so I



3   would sit with her to -- more to aid her with jury selection



4   than anything else.



5   Q.  Did she have any particular nickname within the office?



6   A.  "Homicide Hilda."



7   Q.  After serving in that office as prosecutor assistance for



8   the Attorney General, what did you next do, sir?



9   A.  I ran for the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in 1982 and



10   was successful in defeating an incumbent in the Democratic



11   primary and took office January 1 of 1983 in that capacity.



12   Q.  Is that a statewide office?



13   A.  Yes.



14   Q.  Would you relate briefly to the Court what the jurisdiction



15   of the Court of Criminal Appeals is in Texas?



16   A.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is kind of an unusual



17   animal.  I think only Texas and Oklahoma have, among the 50



18   states, courts of last resort that are set apart for criminal



19   cases.



20            The court as its jurisdiction now stands has



21   jurisdiction over all death penalty cases, has original



22   jurisdiction over all death penalty cases in which the death



23   penalty has been assessed.  If the death penalty has not been



24   assessed, the case is going to go to an intermediate court.



25            All non-death penalty cases go through first the 14







                                            40



   Charles Campbell - Direct



1   intermediate courts of appeals in Texas in a direct appeal, and



2   then there is a discretionary review process similar to a writ



3   process in Federal Court to the Texas Court of Criminal



4   Appeals.



5            The Court of Criminal Appeals also has post-conviction



6   writ jurisdiction as well as mandamus prohibition, procedendo



7   jurisdiction.



8   Q.  It is the highest court of jurisdiction in Texas for



9   criminal cases?



10   A.  It is.



11   Q.  It is equal with the Texas Supreme Court?



12   A.  Well, there is debate about that.  It is an equal



13   institution, yes.



14   Q.  Yes, sir.  How many judges sit on that court?



15   A.  Nine.



16   Q.  How many years did you sit on that court, Judge?



17   A.  12 years.



18   Q.  During that 12-year period, how many death penalty cases



19   with a death penalty verdict did you personally review?



20   A.  Several hundred.  I couldn't tell you exactly.



21   Q.  In 1994 when the Republican sweep of Texas took place in a



22   general election, did you lose your position as a result of



23   that sweep?



24   A.  I did indeed.



25   Q.  What have you done since that period of January 1, '95?







                                            41



   Charles Campbell - Direct



1   A.  I have sat as a visiting judge both on the trial bench and



2   the intermediate appellate bench and I also am adjunct



3   professor of law at Baylor Law School.



4   Q.  And during that period of time from January 1, '95, to



5   present, have you sat as the trial judge on capital murder



6   cases?



7   A.  I sat on two; one last year and one that commenced last



8   year and actually finished up January, February of this year.



9   Q.  Before I get to those two cases, let me go back to your



10   term on the Court of Criminal Appeals.



11            Did you have any official or unofficial position there



12   regarding death penalty issues?



13   A.  I did.  In later years, we were getting backlogged in our



14   death penalty cases, pretty seriously backlogged.  With Harris



15   County, which is Houston, trying scores and scores of them, our



16   death row population reached somewhere in excess of 380 and so



17   we had to do something.



18            We went to the legislature, we got an appropriation of



19   money to actually go out and hire four lawyers and train them



20   and have them work on nothing but capital cases until we could



21   get ourselves in a position that we could have some control



22   over our capital docket.  And basically, my responsibility was



23   to hire those people and to train them in the handling of



24   capital cases.



25   Q.  All right.  Judge, as a prosecutor, approximately how many







                                            42



   Charles Campbell - Direct



1   cases did you try -- capital murder cases?



2   A.  Counting first and second chair, probably a dozen.



3   Q.  And then --



4   A.  A few more, maybe.



5   Q.  Then you sat for 12 years reviewing capital cases.



6   A.  Yes, sir.



7   Q.  And now as a trial judge, you have recently sat as the



8   trial judge on two capital murder cases; is that correct?



9   A.  Yes, sir.



10            MR. WOODS:  Your Honor, may it please the Court, we



11   would tender Judge Campbell as an expert in capital murder



12   cases.



13            MR. MACKEY:  No objection, Judge.



14            THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you, Mr. Mackey.



15   BY MR. WOODS:



16   Q.  Mr. Campbell, let me address these two recent cases; but



17   first, let me ask the question:  Is it the practice in the



18   state of Texas, especially in the larger counties and if not



19   the whole state -- is it the practice where you have multiple



20   defendants in a death penalty case -- is it the practice that



21   the prosecutors bring those separately, rather than jointly?



22   A.  Yes.



23   Q.  Is that a pretty much widespread practice, or just barely



24   51 percent of the cases?



25   A.  As far as I know, it's a widespread practice and has been







                                            43



   Charles Campbell - Direct



1   for some time.



2   Q.  In the case starting in -- the one that you tried in Tyler



3   as a trial judge, were there multiple defendants accused of



4   committing the murder?



5   A.  Yes, there were three.



6   Q.  And were they tried jointly?



7   A.  No.



8   Q.  Did the district attorney attempt to try them jointly?



9   A.  I don't believe so.



10   Q.  Was it a crime where all participants participated equally?



11   A.  Pretty much, yes, it was.  It was -- it was unusual in that



12   situation that the participants -- the three defendants pretty



13   much all played the same role, not only in the aggravating



14   factor, which was kidnapping and robbery -- actually, two, but



15   also in the actual killing of the victim.  They each had a



16   weapon, they each were participating in the kidnapping, they



17   each participated in the robbery essentially equally and they



18   each attempted to -- two of them successfully -- to shoot the



19   victim at the same location at the same time; so essentially,



20   their participation in the guilt phase was almost identical.



21   Q.  Had the district attorney attempted to try those three



22   jointly and had a motion for severance been offered by the



23   defense, would you have granted the motion for severance?



24   A.  Yes, I would, but not on the basis of guilt/innocence



25   problems; more on the basis of punishment problems.







                                            44



   Charles Campbell - Direct



1   Q.  Would you explain to the Court why you would have granted a



2   severance on that?



3   A.  There was a fairly vast difference --



4            MR. MACKEY:  I object to the hypothetical question.



5            THE COURT:  Overruled.  You may proceed.



6            THE WITNESS:  Thank you.



7            There was a fairly vast difference in the backgrounds



8   of the three individuals and also in their ages.  And when I



9   say "backgrounds," I'm really talking about family backgrounds



10   and work backgrounds and criminal history backgrounds and that



11   sort of thing.  There was a substantial difference in their



12   backgrounds, and that would have been the reason why I would



13   have -- would have granted a severance regardless of the



14   guilt/innocence phase of the trial.



15   BY MR. WOODS:



16   Q.  Following up on that being the reason why you would have



17   granted severance, why is it more fair, if that's the reason



18   that you're doing that, for an individual -- one individual at



19   a time to go before a punishing jury, a jury that's hearing the



20   punishment stage?



21   A.  Well, I'm afraid I'm going to sound like an echo to -- I



22   don't know if his name is Professor Johnson or Mr. Johnson



23   (sic).  In any event, the witness that testified before I did.



24            The individualized assessment concept that the Supreme



25   Court has written about in a number of cases, going back to







                                            45



   Charles Campbell - Direct



1   Lockett vs. Ohio and Eddings vs. Oklahoma and continuing



2   through California vs. Brown and even Penry vs. Lynaugh -- the



3   individualized assessment, the need to address the personal



4   moral culpability of the defendant in order for a jury to give



5   a reasoned moral response not only to the crime but to the



6   situation of the defendant is what led me to this particular



7   belief.



8   Q.  Would the problem be compounded if you had two or more



9   people in a punishment stage who were each trying to convince



10   the jury that they were less culpable?



11   A.  I think so.  I think it is a problem because I think it's



12   kind of a situation where they're playing against each other,



13   more or less.  They're fighting against one another to put



14   themselves in the best light.



15            And it all depends really on how any of us, including



16   this judge here, interpret the concept of individualized



17   assessment for a defendant's personal moral culpability.



18            I wish I could tell you what the Supreme Court meant



19   by the term "personal moral culpability."  I really don't know;



20   but because they have treated death differently in their case



21   law, it seems like that is a major factor.  And that's



22   especially so when you've got a situation, as I had in Tyler,



23   where although the guilt/innocence evidence is virtually



24   identical on co-defendants, the punishment evidence is going to



25   be substantially different.







                                            46



   Charles Campbell - Direct



1   Q.  You have seen examples where a defendant will put forth



2   mitigation or mitigating evidence concerning age or concerning



3   family background.  Have you seen incidents where that can work



4   both ways:  Age can be considered not only a mitigator but also



5   an aggravator?



6   A.  I've seen it work both ways with my colleagues on the Court



7   of Criminal Appeals as far as trying to decide what's



8   mitigating and what's not, what's mitigating, what's



9   aggravating.



10            Some people, for instance, feel that a 17-year-old



11   should be -- that the age of 17 should be considered a



12   mitigating factor simply because the person is young, he made a



13   mistake, they're of tender age and they shouldn't -- they



14   shouldn't have the same personal moral culpability, the words



15   used by the Supreme Court.



16            Other people feel just the opposite:  That a 17-year-



17   old is not capable of learning from his or her mistakes and



18   will probably go out and do something like this again, whereas



19   a person who is 35 or 40 or 45 years old is less likely to be a



20   problem to society in the future; so even though something that



21   is seemingly as simple as age is not so simple because personal



22   moral culpability is in the eyes of beholder, frankly.



23   Q.  What about another mitigator, such as a family background?



24   Have you seen that work both ways?



25   A.  I think that can work both ways.  If you have -- if you







                                            47



   Charles Campbell - Direct



1   have a good family background, some people -- some jurors would



2   see that as a mitigating factor.  Others, especially in a state



3   as conservative as Texas, would see that as a reason -- as an



4   aggravating factor; that you had every opportunity, every



5   chance in the world, to make something out of yourself:  You



6   came from a good family and you go out and you do something



7   this heinous, they would consider it an aggravating factor



8   rather than a mitigating factor.



9            So yes, I think that it's a very real problem.



10   Q.  Could you foresee a difficulty if there are two defendants



11   in a punishment stage at one time where one defendant puts



12   forth a mitigator and the other defendant then would attack it



13   as not really a mitigator but an aggravator?



14   A.  Well, that's what I was talking about a while ago; that



15   essentially they end up playing against each other as to what's



16   mitigating and what's aggravating, and the whole thing gets



17   lost.  It's like breaking three eggs to make an omelet:  Once



18   you stir the eggs up with a whisk, it's awfully difficult then



19   to separate the yolk from the white.



20            And I think that's basically what can occur in a



21   situation like you just described.



22   Q.  Are you using that analogy as in the guilt or innocence



23   stage, where they're instructed on law of parties or aiding and



24   abetting and the conspiracy law and then when you get to the



25   punishment stage, they've got to be uninstructed as to that and







                                            48



   Charles Campbell - Direct



1   instructed that you've got to be considering these people



2   individually?



3   A.  I think it can really occur at both stages.



4   Q.  Now, as a trial judge and also as a prosecutor, you've



5   observed trial judges issuing limiting instructions to juries



6   as to what to consider and what not to consider.  Do you feel



7   that limiting instructions can effectively control that issue



8   in a capital punishment hearing where we've got two or more



9   defendants?



10   A.  To a certain extent, it can.  I think juries -- it's like



11   during the course of a voir dire, a juror will tell you that



12   although he expects a defendant to testify that if he's



13   instructed that he can't consider that that he will not



14   consider that and he will be instructed about that during the



15   course of the trial.  And I think that it's fairly accurate to



16   say that jurors, for the most part, follow instructions that



17   judges give them.  If they didn't, we'd be in a real mess.



18            On the other hand, juries are human beings, like all



19   of us.  So when you tell them not to consider something, they



20   will try very hard.  In fact, they'll tell you during voir dire



21   that they will try very hard.  It's unusual to have a juror who



22   will actually say, I will unhesitatingly follow the law, if you



23   give it to me, because you're the judge and I'm not.



24            Human emotions generally take over in the jury room,



25   where none of us are allowed, nor should we be; and I think --







                                            49



   Charles Campbell - Direct



1   you know, the limiting instruction, I'm sure, has some effect.



2   How much effect, I really don't know.  I couldn't measure it



3   quantitatively.



4   Q.  Is there a strong presumption of jurors to believe that



5   birds of a feather flock together and that's very difficult to



6   dislodge?



7   A.  I think that's a problem that you fight any time that you



8   have multiple defendants, whether it be a capital case or a



9   non-capital case.



10   Q.  Is it more exacerbated in a capital case?



11   A.  I think it is, especially the more heinous the crime,



12   because I think that the jury tends to want to find at least



13   one person who is going to be assessed a death penalty simply



14   because the crime is so heinous that someone out of this group



15   must be punished by having their life taken.  And that --



16   therein can create a problem.



17   Q.  And if there are two or more jurors (sic) there in the



18   penalty stage, they're trying to convince the jury to take the



19   other person and not them?  Is that correct?



20   A.  Yes.  That's right.



21   Q.  Have you ever tried a capital murder case as a defense



22   lawyer, Judge?



23   A.  No.



24            MR. WOODS:  Thank you.  We pass the witness.



25            THE COURT:  All right.  Mr. Mackey?

1                          CROSS-EXAMINATION



2   BY MR. MACKEY:



3   Q.  Judge Russell (sic), good morning.  Do you recall speaking



4   to me on Monday afternoon?



5   A.  I spoke to several people in a conference room.  I don't



6   remember who all I did talk to.  I'm sure I did.



7   Q.  Judge Russell, you lost --



8   A.  Campbell.  I'm sorry.



9   Q.  Excuse me.



10   A.  It's all right.



11   Q.  Judge Campbell.



12   A.  Maybe if I had run as Judge Russell, I would have won.



13   Q.  Mr. Stevenson might want to get into this discussion here



14   briefly, too.



15            Judge Campbell, I'm sorry.



16            A couple years ago, you lost election for the



17   appellate court?



18   A.  Yes, I did.



19   Q.  Tell me, then, what position you currently hold.



20   A.  Under the Texas law, Texas Government Code, judges are



21   allowed to certify to the chief justice of the Texas Supreme



22   Court that they're willing to sit as visiting judges and



23   basically pledge in writing that they will not appear in any



24   court within a two-year period of time as an advocate for a



25   client.







                                            51



    Charles Campbell - Cross



1   Q.  Since that time, have you been a full-time trial court



2   judge?



3   A.  Trial and appellate.  I've done both.  Probably -- it's



4   been about 60/40.  About 60 percent trial and about 40 percent



5   appellate.



6   Q.  Tell Judge Matsch, please, how many juries you have seated



7   as a trial court judge.



8   A.  How many juries I've seated?



9   Q.  Yes, your Honor.



10   A.  I don't have an exact number, but in the last two years,



11   probably a dozen or so.  10 to 12.



12   Q.  Two of those have been capital cases?



13   A.  Yes, sir.



14   Q.  Going back in time to your experience as a prosecutor, do



15   you recall outlining that for Mr. Woods?



16   A.  Yes.



17   Q.  And you detailed for us experience totaling 12 or more



18   capital cases that you personally have tried?



19   A.  Yes, sir.



20   Q.  Mr. Woods didn't ask and you didn't mention that some of



21   those cases were multiple defendant cases, were they not?



22   A.  I believe one was.  I believe one case was, yes, sir.



23   Q.  Have you gone back to research --



24   A.  No, sir, I haven't.



25   Q.  -- those cases?







                                            52



    Charles Campbell - Cross



1   A.  No, sir.



2   Q.  Do you recall telling me on Monday, it was three?



3   A.  No, sir, I don't; but I may have.



4   Q.  In any event, as a prosecutor, at some point in time, you



5   elected to charge jointly in the same case multiple capital



6   defendants?



7   A.  Yes, sir.



8   Q.  The widespread practice you've described in Texas, then,



9   was that also your practice during the time you were a



10   prosecutor?



11   A.  Prior to the Penry decision, it was, yes, sir.



12   Q.  And you were on the bench in the Court of Appeals in Texas



13   when the Penry decision was announced?



14   A.  In 1989, yes, sir, I sure was.



15   Q.  Judge Campbell, have you looked at the sentencing results



16   in cases in Texas involving capital defendants and compared the



17   differences between life and death verdicts between joint and



18   single defendant trials?



19   A.  You mean numerically?  I'm not sure what you mean.



20   Q.  Yes, your Honor.



21   A.  No, I have not.



22   Q.  Okay.  Reviewing hundreds of capital cases --



23   A.  Yes, sir.



24   Q.  -- have you observed any trend where it is more likely that



25   a defendant joined at trial in the capital case gets death, as







                                            53



    Charles Campbell - Cross



1   opposed to a single case?



2   A.  I have not seen that many that were joined in the first



3   place.  I'm sure that there is a handful out there.  Of the



4   hundreds that I considered over a period of 12 years, I'm sure



5   that there were -- there is a handful out there; but how many,



6   I do not know.



7            The vast majority of them were tried individually,



8   separately.



9   Q.  How many opinions have you written or authored concerning



10   issues about motions for severance?



11   A.  I have no idea.



12   Q.  How many --



13   A.  A lot.  Many.



14   Q.  And how many have you reviewed in capital cases?



15   A.  Personally?



16   Q.  Yes.



17   A.  Again, it would be in the hundreds.



18   Q.  As you have become acquainted with the law on severance in



19   Texas court --



20   A.  Yes, sir.



21   Q.  -- Judge Campbell, would you agree that it is a



22   fact-specific analysis?



23   A.  That is a fact-specific analysis?  I'm not sure I



24   understand what you mean by "fact-specific analysis" as applied



25   to severance.







                                            54



    Charles Campbell - Cross



1   Q.  The issue addressed to the trial court, Judge Campbell, is



2   one that requires a balancing of various factors?



3   A.  Oh, yes.  Yes.



4   Q.  What have you done, Judge Campbell, to become familiar with



5   the facts or factors in this particular prosecution?



6   A.  Very little.  Read hurriedly through a portion of the



7   motions for severance.



8   Q.  Did you read the Defendant Nichols' motion for severance?



9   A.  Yes.



10   Q.  Did you --



11   A.  Not the entire motion.  I read pretty much the part that



12   pertains to the punishment phase.



13   Q.  Did you read any portion of the motion and exhibits of



14   Defendant McVeigh?



15   A.  Not any of the exhibits, no.



16   Q.  Did you read any portion of the motion?



17   A.  Yes.



18   Q.  Did you read any portion of the Government's response?



19   A.  I believe I read the Government's entire response, yes,



20   sir.  I think I read that on the plane yesterday afternoon, as



21   a matter of fact.



22   Q.  In the course of that review, Judge Campbell, did you



23   identify certain factors that might be addressed if you had the



24   same decision facing you in this case?



25   A.  I identified some factors in the federal death penalty







                                            55



    Charles Campbell - Cross



1   statute that I looked at that seemed to take care of some of



2   the problems that Texas had in its previous statute.



3   Q.  You would agree that a legitimate factor in the decision



4   whether to sever is the cost of two trials; correct?



5   A.  I think it's a legitimate factor.  I would not weigh it in



6   as a very heavy factor in a death penalty case.



7   Q.  But it ought to be in the equation?



8   A.  Probably should, yes, sir.  I mean I don't believe that you



9   can ever treat taxpayers' money like it's play money, is what



10   I'm trying to say; but on the other hand, the Supreme Court



11   itself has said that death is different, and that means that



12   perhaps it's not as important in the equation in a death



13   penalty case as it would be in a non-death penalty case.



14   Q.  You would agree, Judge Campbell, that the risk of tainting



15   the jury pool by attempting to select a second jury after a



16   first highly publicized trial is a factor to weigh?



17   A.  It would be a factor, yes, sir.



18   Q.  In your experience, Judge Campbell, have you had any case



19   as highly publicized as this one?



20   A.  Not nationwide publicity, no.  Statewide publicity, yes.



21   Q.  Judge Campbell, would you also agree that it's a legitimate



22   factor to concern yourself with the risks of inconsistent



23   verdicts?



24   A.  Inconsistent verdicts in what sense?



25   Q.  Two juries presented with the same set of facts reaching







                                            56



    Charles Campbell - Cross



1   starkly different results.



2   A.  I would find it unusual at least as to the punishment phase



3   of a capital trial that you would have the same set of facts as



4   to any two defendants.  I would not think that would be a great



5   consideration because I just don't think that you've got any



6   two people in this world that are similarly situated for the



7   punishment phase, at least of a capital trial.



8   Q.  You agree there is a risk of inconsistent verdicts when the



9   same case is presented to two different juries?



10   A.  There could be insofar as the guilt phase is concerned.



11   Much less so as far as the punishment phase is concerned.



12   Q.  As you weigh the various factors in that decision, would



13   you take into account the number of defendants in that



14   potential joint trial?



15   A.  You mean two as opposed to twelve?



16   Q.  Is the number itself relevant in your analysis?



17   A.  Logistically, I would think so, yes, sir.



18   Q.  When you test it against the risk of juror confusion, would



19   you agree there is less risk if there is two defendants as



20   opposed to a greater number?



21   A.  Juror confusion about what?



22   Q.  About the individual characteristics of each defendant,



23   about their role in the crime.



24   A.  No, I wouldn't think that that would be a particularly



25   important thing to -- for a judge to consider.







                                            57



    Charles Campbell - Cross



1   Q.  Are you familiar with the federal death penalty statute?



2   A.  Barely.  I read it in the last two days.



3   Q.  In preparation for your testimony today?



4   A.  Just basically -- yeah, basically to look at it and to try



5   to glean how it compared to the Texas statute.



6   Q.  Incidentally, Judge Campbell, when were you first asked to



7   become a witness in this proceeding?



8   A.  Monday.  Monday of this week.



9   Q.  Was that by Counsel Ron Woods?



10   A.  It was actually by the gentleman that used for work for me,



11   Mr. Neureiter.



12   Q.  In any event, you've known Mr. Woods for a number of years



13   from Houston?



14   A.  Oh, yes.  Yes.



15   Q.  Based even on your cursory review of the federal statute,



16   you did not find any prohibition against joint defendant



17   capital cases, did you?



18   A.  Oh, no, sir.



19   Q.  Can you tell this Judge any Supreme Court case that



20   prohibits under the Eighth Amendment joint capital trials?



21   A.  I certainly can't do that, because there isn't one.



22   Q.  You read Buchanan?



23   A.  Pardon me?



24   Q.  Have you read Buchanan?



25   A.  I read Buchanan in a different context.







                                            58



    Charles Campbell - Cross



1   Q.  But you and I would agree there is no Supreme Court opinion



2   that prohibits jointly tried capital defendants in Federal



3   Court?



4   A.  There is no Supreme Court opinion that has addressed the



5   specific issue that you're talking about; that's correct.



6   Q.  And in the hundreds of opinions that you've authored in the



7   Texas Court of Appeals, have you ever expressed the opinion



8   that the Eighth Circuit -- or excuse me -- the Eighth Amendment



9   prohibits joint capital trials?



10   A.  No.  I don't think the issue ever came up, actually.



11   Q.  Is that your opinion today?



12   A.  That it would be a problem?



13   Q.  That the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution



14   prohibits per se --



15   A.  The punishment phase, yes, sir.



16   Q.  That's your opinion?



17   A.  Yes, sir.



18   Q.  And what case or cases do you rely on most in asserting



19   that opinion?



20   A.  Lockett, Eddings, California vs. Brown, Penry vs. Lynaugh,



21   Franklin vs. Lynaugh.



22   Q.  Judge Campbell, you told the Court that the single most



23   important issue in the penalty phase is that the jury give



24   individualized consideration; correct?



25   A.  That's what the Supreme Court seems to think.  I don't know







                                            59



    Charles Campbell - Cross



1   that it really matters what I think, but I suppose that I would



2   have to agree with the Supreme Court.  It makes sense that



3   individualized assessment of one's personal moral culpability



4   is an extremely important factor, if not the most important



5   factor in a capital case.  At least at the punishment phase.



6   Q.  And it's within the trial court's power to tell the jury



7   that that's their duty, is it not?



8   A.  That what is their duty?



9   Q.  That they must, when they decide life or death questions,



10   give individualized consideration to the defendants.



11   A.  Certainly.  Certainly that's in the judge's discretion.



12   Q.  And such an instruction in your view would be valuable?



13   A.  It would be valuable.  Whether it would be a cure-all, I



14   think, is real problematic.  It would certainly be valuable.



15   Q.  Judge Campbell, did you have a chance before taking the



16   stand to review your opinion in Martinez vs. State of Texas,



17   cited at 899 SW.2d 655?



18   A.  I'm not sure.  I know Mr. Neureiter handed me something and



19   I read it, but I don't remember if it was Martinez or not.



20   Q.  That's the only opinion I gave him to provide to you.  Did



21   you have a chance to read it?



22   A.  Yes.  I read through it, yes, sir.



23   Q.  Do you remember the facts in that case, Judge Campbell,



24   involved two defendants who were charged in separate cases?



25   Correct?







                                            60



    Charles Campbell - Cross



1   A.  I believe they were tried separately, were they not?



2   Q.  One was a principal charged with committing --



3   A.  I don't really remember the facts, to be honest with you.



4   And I don't think the facts were set out at all in whatever I



5   looked at.  What I looked at was about three pages of analysis,



6   the specific point of error, as I recall.  And I'll be honest



7   with you:  I do not remember the facts from Martinez.



8            MR. WOODS:  May it please the Court, if he's going to



9   question him about the details of the case, we ask that the



10   Judge be provided with the two-and-a-half-page case.



11            THE COURT:  Is that agreeable to you?



12            MR. MACKEY:  Sure.  I can provide it to him.



13            THE COURT:  All right.  Hand the opinion to the Judge.



14   BY MR. MACKEY:



15   Q.  Judge Campbell, I direct your attention to page 2 of the



16   opinion.



17   A.  All right.



18   Q.  Do you see in the left-hand column the recitation of the



19   charge in that particular case?



20   A.  Yes.  Are you talking about the application paragraph?



21   Q.  Footnote 13.



22   A.  Or the abstract -- pardon me?



23   Q.  Footnote 13, second page, upper left-hand column.



24   A.  All right.



25            Yes, I see it.







                                            61



    Charles Campbell - Cross



1   Q.  Do you recall after reviewing that that there was a



2   defendant charged with a triple murder?



3   A.  I do not.



4   Q.  Is that what it says?



5   A.  I'll take your word for it, but I do not remember the facts



6   of the case.



7   Q.  Looking at that particular language, does it read to



8   describe --



9   A.  Yes.



10   Q.  -- a defendant charged with a triple murder?



11   A.  Yes, it does.



12   Q.  And that defendant's name was Miguel -- help me out.



13   A.  Miguel Angel Martinez.



14   Q.  No, no.  The principal defendant.



15   A.  Pardon me?



16   Q.  The --



17   A.  Miguel Angel Venegas.



18   Q.  Thank you.  Venegas was the killer, according to the



19   charge?



20   A.  Yes.



21   Q.  Triple murder using an axe and knife; correct?



22   A.  Yes.



23   Q.  And in that same charge, a second defendant was charged



24   simply as an aider and abettor; is that correct?



25   A.  Correct.







                                            62



    Charles Campbell - Cross



1   Q.  That would be Mr. Martinez?



2   A.  Uh-huh.



3   Q.  Mr. Martinez went to trial alone, did he not?



4   A.  Yes, he it did.



5   Q.  And he was convicted?



6   A.  Yes, sir.



7   Q.  And sentenced to death?



8   A.  Yes, sir.



9   Q.  And in the guilt phase, the trial court gave the Texas law



10   parties instruction?



11   A.  Yes.



12   Q.  Which essentially means the conduct of the other can be



13   held against Mr. Martinez; correct?



14   A.  That's the loose interpretation of it, but correct.



15   Basically correct, yes, sir.



16   Q.  Loose but accurate?



17   A.  Basically correct, yes, sir.



18   Q.  So at the trial phase, the jury had to -- in fact were



19   permitted to review the conduct of someone other than



20   Mr. Martinez; correct?



21   A.  Yes.



22   Q.  He was convicted of murder, first degree, and the case



23   moved to the penalty phase; correct?



24   A.  Correct.



25   Q.  What did the trial judge do then, Judge Cce is a converse parties

charge.  That's what



11   the defendant wanted.  That's what the judge wouldn't give him.



12            Instead, the judge gave this short instruction which



13   basically says essentially the same thing that the antiparties



14   charge would have said in much fewer words.



15   Q.  Which is why you and the rest of the members of the court



16   affirmed that conviction and the death sentence?



1   6   Campbell.



7   A.  "You are further instructed that in answering the issue



8   submitted to you, you will confine yourselves in answering the



9   following issues to the conduct of the defendant standing



10   alone."



11   Q.  So at the guilt phase, the trial judge says you can look at



12   all the conduct.  In the penalty phase, he instructed the jury



13   consider the conduct of this defendant alone; correct?



14   A.  Yes.



15   Q.  And that was the issue that faced you and the other members



16   of this en banc opinion?



17   A.  Well, not exactly.  The defendant actually had requested an



18   antiparties charge and the judge wouldn't give it.  And that



19   was the point of error.



20   Q.  You wrote this opinion?



21   A.  Yes, sir.



22   Q.  And what you said was that the instruction he gave was



23   entirely correct --



24   A.  I don't think we said it was entirely correct.  I think we



25   said that an antiparties charge, which I understand to be a







                                            64



    Charles Campbell - Cross



1   converse parties charge, or in laymen's terms, a flip-flop



2   charge, is what he was really wanting; and the judge didn't



3   give a flip-flop charge.  He basically just said you can't --



4   you've got to consider the actions of the defendant standing



5   alone.  In other words, he didn't give a converse charge.  A



6   converse parties charge, in other words.



7   Q.  Whatever --



8   A.  Which would say, You cannot consider him as a party, and



9   then proceed to define the Texas law of parties so that what



10   you have in essence is a converse parties charge.  That's what



11   the defendant wanted.  That's what the judge wouldn't give him.



12            Instead, the judge gave this short instruction which



13   basically says essentially the same thing that the antiparties



14   charge would have said in much fewer words.



15   Q.  Which is why you and the rest of the members of the court



16   affirmed that conviction and the death sentence?



17   A.  Basically on the idea that it was -- that it substantially



18   complied with the idea that it was an antiparties instruction,



19   yes, sir.



20   Q.  You were satisfied, Judge Campbell, then that a jury, first



21   being given facts about the conduct of a second defendant,



22   could keep that separate as they weighed the question --



23   A.  That was not the issue before me in that case.  The issue



24   before me is if that instruction was a sufficient instruction.



25   Q.  You affirmed the death penalty?

    Charles Campbell - Cross



1   A.  Yes, sir.



2            MR. MACKEY:  Thank you.  Nothing else.



3            THE WITNESS:  Sure.



4            THE COURT:  Mr. Woods, do you have some follow-up?



5            MR. WOODS:  Just one question, your Honor.



6                        REDIRECT EXAMINATION



7   BY MR. WOODS:



8   Q.  Judge Campbell, in that case, the defendant was being tried



9   separately, was he not?



10   A.  Yes, that's correct.



11   Q.  And the instruction was that the jury is to consider in the



12   punishment stage just this individual.  But at the guilt stage,



13   they had to consider both; right?



14   A.  That's correct.



15            MR. WOODS:  Thank you.  That's what we're hoping for



16   here.



17            Thank you.  No further questions, your Honor.



18            THE COURT:  Are you excusing the witness, I take it?



19            MR. WOODS:  Yes, your Honor, we would ask him to be



20   excused.



21            THE COURT:  Mr. Mackey?



22            MR. MACKEY:  Yes.



23            THE COURT:  Judge, you may step down and are excused.



24            We'll take our morning recess at this time.  20



25   minutes.

12                         DIRECT EXAMINATION



13   BY MR. THURSCHWELL:



14   Q.  Mr. Wymore, how are you currently employed?



15   A.  I'm the chief deputy public defender for the state of



16   Colorado.



17   Q.  And how long have you been chief deputy public defender?



18   A.  14 years.



19   Q.  What -- briefly, what are your responsibilities in that



20   position?



21   A.  I'm the lead counsel on death penalty cases.  I supervise,



22   I instruct on death penalty litigation.  Primarily, I'm the



23   chief trial deputy, one of them.  There's two of us in death



24   penalty.  I assist in administrative matters.  I teach on a lot



25   of other things, instructing in trial tactics, litigation.







                                            67



     David Wymore - Direct



1   Q.  Is that a state-wide position?



2   A.  Yeah.



3   Q.  How many capital cases have you handled?  Let me revise



4   that.  How many capital defendants have you represented during



5   your career?



6   A.  A rough estimate, 30 to 35, 40.  Capital defendants.



7   People who have had the threat of the death penalty attached to



8   them one way or the other, either by formal filing or some sort



9   of the threat of the death penalty.



10   Q.  And of those, how many did you try to verdict?



11   A.  Five.  One of them was hung.  One of them was a hung trial.



12   One of them actually hung himself so --



13   Q.  That's unfortunate for him.  How many capital cases have



14   been tried to verdict in the state of Colorado to your



15   knowledge since -- during the past fourteen years?



16   A.  Well, in the past 14 years, I would use 1979 as a line of



17   demarcation because it -- certain things happened in terms of



18   structuring the penalty, but my -- my number is 35 trials.  38



19   defendants.



20   Q.  All right.  And are you generally familiar with the facts



21   and proceedings in those trials?



22   A.  Yes.  In a sliding scale.  Obviously, the cases I've tried



23   myself, I'm more familiar with.  The ones by my office, less



24   familiar with.  And then as it goes down to private counsel.



25   Generally, yes.







                                            68



     David Wymore - Direct



1   Q.  Have you tried any joint capital trials?



2   A.  Yes, I have.



3   Q.  How many?



4   A.  Joint capital trials?  One.



5   Q.  How many have been tried in the state of Colorado, to your



6   knowledge?



7   A.  Two since '79.



8   Q.  How many jurors in your estimate have you voir dired in



9   capital cases?



10   A.  As death litigation, publicity, those issues?



11   Q.  Yes.  All of the issues that one would voir dire in a



12   capital case.



13   A.  Over 1,000.  Perhaps 1,500.



14   Q.  Are there -- in your knowledge -- to your knowledge, are



15   there any attorneys either for the prosecution or the defense



16   who have tried more death penalty cases in the state of



17   Colorado than you?



18   A.  More?  No.  Not since '79.



19   Q.  Have you taught or lectured in the area of capital



20   litigation?



21   A.  Yes, I have.



22   Q.  And when would that been?



23   A.  Over the course of the last 14 years, I sometimes go and do



24   presentations at bar associations for various criminal defense



25   bars in other states.  I'm also on the faculty of the NAACP,







                                            69



     David Wymore - Direct



1   LDF Airlie conference which I consider to be the most



2   prestigious organization dealing with capital litigation.  I've



3   given presentations at Life in the Balance, which is another



4   national organization that gets a group of attorneys, capital



5   defendants -- capital defense attorneys and give them



6   presentations there.



7   Q.  Have you ever tried a case in federal court?



8   A.  No.



9   Q.  Are you familiar with the federal capital sentences?



10   A.  To the extent that I've reviewed it, yes.  Not to the



11   extent that I've actually had to work through it, but I've read



12   it.



13   Q.  And could you describe the similarities between the



14   Colorado sentencing -- death penalty sentencing scheme and the



15   federal scheme?



16   A.  Yes.  Generally, it's a -- they are the same thing.  It's a



17   jury decision as opposed to a judge decision.  It's a



18   bifurcated trial where you have the guilt phase -- what we call



19   the guilt phase first.  You have the penalty phase second.



20   It's a weighing statute where the jurors are going to weigh



21   mitigation versus aggravation, certain guidelines that are



22   built into the statute.  There's some burdens of proof that are



23   attached.  There are some statutory aggravating factors.



24   There's some statutory mitigating factors, some open-ended



25   mitigation, and it appears to be a one vote for life or







                                            70



     David Wymore - Direct



1   unanimous for death statute, also, Federal, same as state.



2   Q.  Are there any particularly relevant differences?



3   A.  There is one from the point of view of the defense that I



4   think is interesting and somewhat makes it different is that



5   there's a burden of proof attached to mitigating factors in the



6   federal statute.  Preponderance of the evidence as to



7   mitigation.  In the Colorado statute, what we have is the fact



8   of mitigation where mitigation carries no burden.  It just



9   simply -- if there's a suggestion of mitigation, a juror can



10   find it to exist and then attach whatever weight it wants in



11   the determination; whereas, here, you have mitigation by



12   statute with an attached burden of proof which gives it a



13   burden of persuasion.  You've got to carry the burden to



14   establish the mitigating factor.  You don't in Colorado.



15            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Your Honor, we would tender



16   Mr. Wymore as an expert in the conduct of bifurcated capital



17   trials.



18            MR. MACKEY:  No objection.



19            THE COURT:  All right.  You may proceed.



20   BY MR. THURSCHWELL:



21   Q.  Mr. Wymore, in your opinion, given the same two defendants



22   and all other things being equal, is a joint trial of two



23   capitally charged defendants likely to be as fair as a joint



24   trial of two noncapital defendants?



25   A.  No.







                                            71



     David Wymore - Direct



1   Q.  Okay.  Now, I -- without re-covering ground already



2   covered, I want to take you through the trial process and have



3   you explain to me on the basis of examples and hypotheticals



4   why you hold that opinion.



5   A.  Okay.



6   Q.  And I'd like to start with jury selection.



7   A.  All right.



8   Q.  You heard Mr. Stevenson testify about life qualification of



9   jurors.



10   A.  Yes.



11   Q.  Could you -- life qualification is the process by which the



12   Court is assured that a particular juror is capable of



13   rendering a life verdict in an appropriate case; is that



14   accurate?



15   A.  Yes.  Yes, essentially.



16   Q.  Could you briefly give us an example of how a life



17   qualification voir dire would work.



18   A.  Well, okay.  It comes primarily after death qualification.



19   I mean, the series of questions begin as to what they feel



20   about the death penalty, and the juror may come up with an



21   answer of whether or not he believes in it or doesn't believe



22   in it or for or against, things like that.  Primarily what the



23   defense -- what you're interested in under Morgan vs. Illinois



24   and Wainwright vs. Witt, taking those two principles together,



25   is not only is the juror death-qualified, could he render a







                                            72



     David Wymore - Direct



1   death verdict in an appropriate case, but could he also render



2   a life verdict if the burden of proof or the situation calls



3   for a life verdict.



4            As you go through and start to have to deal with



5   qualifying or understanding if a juror is a life juror -- he



6   may be mitigation-impaired for your case but otherwise a good



7   juror in another case -- it's important to try and understand



8   whether or not that particular juror can listen to mitigation



9   in your case.



10   Q.  Let me stop you there and ask you:  What do you mean by



11   mitigation-impaired?



12   A.  Mitigation is -- is a rough concept for jurors.  It's a



13   rough concept for them to get a grip on, and half -- half the



14   time in voir dire you spend trying to explain to them what it



15   is.  It's one of the first questions they ask.  Mitigation-



16   impaired is that although -- mitigation could be a number of



17   things.  It comes from -- the definition from Black's Law 



18   Dictionary, I think, is about fairness and mercy factors given



19   for life as opposed to for death is a simple way of putting it.



20            If your mitigation -- let's take age, and that's an



21   example the judge was using.  If your mitigation is that you're



22   old or -- older -- I'm starting to call myself that now.  If



23   you're 45, 46 years old, you've led a good life and you have a



24   good background, is that a mitigating factor if it's put forth?



25   It is mitigation under the -- under all the concepts of the







                                            73



     David Wymore - Direct



1   Eighth Amendment and the way it's been determined.  However, 17



2   is also a mitigating factor, too.



3            However, if the juror is impaired from believing or



4   cannot consider your theme of mitigation, whatever it may be --



5   it could be drugs.  I didn't take them, I did take them.  If



6   it's drugs and they think that it's an aggravating factor,



7   they're mitigation-impaired from considering a mitigating



8   factor in terms of giving you a life verdict.



9   Q.  So would it be accurate to say that if a juror who -- who



10   cannot consider age, older age as a mitigating factor for your



11   client who is -- has that age, that that has -- as to your



12   client, that juror is mitigation-impaired?



13   A.  I'd challenge him under Wainwright vs. Witt.



14   Q.  And that -- and if you could show successfully under



15   Wainwright vs. Witt, he was essentially impaired from



16   considering that as mitigation, that person would not sit as a



17   life qualified juror?



18   A.  I'd challenge them for cause.  It would up to the judge to



19   determine whether or not it was a sustainable challenge or not,



20   but I'd challenge them for cause and leave it for the appeal



21   court if I'm -- if he's on.



22   Q.  Mr. Wymore, how does this concept of mitigation impairment



23   complicate the joint capital voir dire proceeding?



24   A.  The way it -- the way it complicates a joint capital trial



25   is this:  If you have -- it's pretty simple.  If you have two







                                            74



     David Wymore - Direct



1   competing mitigation theories, say one is age and say one is --



2   one guy is older, one guy is younger; one guy has a history of



3   drugs and alcohol, one guy does not; one defense attorney -- or



4   one party, party A, is going to be saying that the juror is



5   saying, well, I find drugs to be -- lack of drugs is -- would



6   be or the use of drugs is an aggravating factor essentially for



7   me.  I can't consider it as mitigation.



8            That may be consistent with A's theory of mitigation.



9   However, B cannot live with that because he may have drugs and



10   alcohol in his background that is going to be put forward as



11   mitigation and under the law have the right to have it



12   considered as mitigation, but that juror would be not a juror



13   that could listen to that mitigation package or that mitigating



14   factor.  You would have a challenge from one and an objection



15   from the other.  A would object to the challenge of B.



16   Q.  Mr. Wymore, why isn't that a problem that can be solved by



17   judicial instructions; for example, a judicial instruction to



18   each juror that they must seriously and carefully consider all



19   mitigating factors put forth as to each defendant individually?



20   A.  I think you can always instruct as to anything.  The



21   problem is is it a realistic aspect that the juror is going to



22   respond to it.  I think that's unrealistic on a juror to try



23   and understand two things that are connected both emotionally



24   and from their own inherent moralistic assessment of whether a



25   person should live or die.







                                            75



     David Wymore - Direct



1            Take the example of the person who does not believe in



2   drugs or alcohol.  He's not going to connect, just simply



3   doesn't believe that alcohol and drugs can be a mitigating



4   factor.  You're basically going to be telling that juror, reset



5   your emotional and -- reset your emotional situation back to



6   zero and reset your -- your inherent moralistic compass back to



7   zero and do this again, whether you've already emotionally



8   attached to a mitigation such as drugs or alcohol and child



9   abuse and everything else.  It's just simply unrealistic.  I



10   don't believe they can do it.



11   Q.  Let me pose another situation for you.  Take the -- as a



12   hypothetical, the example of two joined capital defendants



13   against one whom there is evidence of racial prejudice on his



14   part and against the other, there is no such evidence.  One



15   racially prejudiced -- there's evidence of racial prejudice,



16   one there is not.  Does that pose any special problems in a



17   capital proceeding?



18   A.  That would explode the problems.



19   Q.  And how so?



20   A.  Well, the situation is this:  What you know inherently and



21   intuitively as a criminal defense lawyer and I think as a



22   person in the judicial system as well as from the studies, is



23   that jurors -- that, basically, there's a skewing of the jury



24   that begins to go on immediately upon death qualification.  If



25   you don't believe in the death penalty, you're out of the case.







                                            76



     David Wymore - Direct



1   So it begins to skew as it goes on.  And so the pile seems to



2   get a little smaller and a little more twisted off to one part.



3   Q.  When you're talking about skewing, you're talking about



4   skewing towards a willingness to impose the death penalty?



5   A.  Well, you're skewing it basically out of a fair cross-



6   section of the jury.  I mean, people who are not against -- who



7   are not for the death penalty are left out of the pile



8   immediately, and then you start taking them off the other back



9   end.



10            What happens is in -- intuitively in what I've seen



11   from my practice is that people who are -- who succeed in



12   making it into the eligible death pool, been qualified as a



13   death juror, that are of racial minority, black, Hispanic,



14   women, or other minority aspect where they have a minority



15   sense about them, that not that many -- you start losing a good



16   deal of them as you go on into death qualification.



17            Now you have them in the pool, the ones that have



18   survived that can consider a life or death sentence at the



19   time.  Well, they can consider a death sentence.  Let's take it



20   there.  Then those jurors inherently are more sympathetic, in



21   my opinion, to hearing mitigation after they have convicted



22   somebody of first-degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt of a



23   heinous crime.  Those are jurors you want to protect and to



24   save and to have as part of the pool that's eligible to go in



25   and hear the case.







                                            77



     David Wymore - Direct



1            If you have two defendants -- and the example you gave



2   me, you have A and you have B.  If there's going to be evidence



3   of racial motive, bias, something else directed against A, A



4   cannot live with those jurors that are traditionally and just



5   inherently more able to hear the mitigation package of B.  A



6   may begin to challenge the jurors on legitimate cause



7   challenges, your Honor -- such as I could envision the



8   challenge such as this:  Your Honor, I'm challenging Juror A --



9   or Juror No. 12, who happens to be a black person, on the basis



10   that my mitigation package is that I was a racist and that I



11   was raised to be a racist.  I was raised in a situation that



12   might cause me to be a racist and I behaved that way, so,



13   therefore, I'm challenging because he will not listen to my



14   mitigation package, as a racist.



15            That, to -- the dilemma then becomes if the court



16   entertains that and allows that to be a sustained challenge for



17   cause.  Because if the person says, if you bring forward to me



18   a person who's a racist, I will not listen to whatever else may



19   be in their life.  Co-defendant B, they say wait a minute,



20   where is my juror going?  Where is my part of my jury going?



21   Because one co-defendant's jury in mitigation is not



22   necessarily another co-defendant's jury in mitigation.  The



23   choices become three- or four-fold.



24   Q.  Let me stop you there.  If you're Defendant B, the one



25   against who there is no racial prejudice evidenced -- if you're







                                            78



     David Wymore - Direct



1   his attorney, what do you do at the point where Defendant A's



2   attorney moves to strike the minority juror?



3   A.  Well, you know -- I mean, just in this hypothetical, you



4   can challenge, you could object to the entire pool.  You could



5   move to have the entire pool stricken.  You could move for



6   severance.  You could definitely start beginning raising the



7   Batson challenge because the basis of the challenge is race



8   based even though it may be a legitimate cause base challenge.



9            Depending on whether the prosecutor is choosing to



10   join in on the challenge or not, you begin and it begins to



11   unfold.  I mean, that's the issue of Batson.  That's the issue



12   of race in jury selections and complications as it goes into



13   death qualification.  You challenge.



14   Q.  So the judge will be confronted with a Batson challenge as



15   to each of the minority jurors is at least likely in a case



16   involving two co-defendants?



17   A.  In the hypothetical, B would have to make those challenges.



18   As to Co-defendant A and -- and whether or not the prosecution



19   joins in it or not, it just complicates it.



20   Q.  Okay.  Now, let me move on to the guilt phase.



21   A.  All right.



22   Q.  You heard, I think, Mr. Stevenson testify that one of the



23   concerns in the guilt phase in a capital trial is the need for



24   consistent theories between the guilt phase and penalty phase



25   of that trial in order to convince ultimately the jury that







                                            79



     David Wymore - Direct



1   your client should live.  Do you agree with that?



2   A.  Yes.  Inherently -- you're talking about your own case?



3   Q.  That's correct.



4   A.  One defendant.



5   Q.  One defendant?



6   A.  Yes.  Absolutely.



7   Q.  Okay.  Is -- is part of that problem the -- the fact that



8   evidence entered in the guilt phase can and will be used by the



9   jury in considering whether the defendant should live or die in



10   the penalty phase?



11   A.  Absolutely.  From the very minute you begin picking a jury



12   in a capital case, you're picking the jury with the assumption



13   that you may or will end up in the penalty phase.  If you're a



14   competent, effective defense attorney, you have to believe



15   you're going to be there.  So it affects the entire way you



16   select jurors, the questions you ask during voir dire, your --



17   your evidence that you present and how you -- how you present



18   your evidence within the guilt phase.



19   Q.  Staying with the guilt phase for the moment, isn't it



20   possible -- is it possible for a judge, by sufficiently



21   specific instructions, to cure any of that spillover prejudice



22   if I can call it that, or spillover evidence or prejudice



23   between the guilt phase evidence and the penalty phase evidence



24   by sufficiently adequate instructions?



25   A.  I don't believe so.







                                            80



     David Wymore - Direct



1   Q.  Okay.



2   A.  Not in all aspects, no.



3   Q.  Could you give us an example to illustrate the problem.



4   A.  All right.  Back to A and B.  Say, the prosecution calls a



5   witness for the limited purpose of introducing evidence against



6   Co-defendant B.  And it's going to be similar transaction



7   evidence, or we call it a 404(b) or some other bad act that may



8   be connected to motive or something else.  The prosecution will



9   get up and begin to tell the -- in a limiting instruction to



10   the jury, please only consider this against the Co-defendant B



11   and do not consider it in terms of credibility, do not consider



12   it in terms of character.  It can be concerned with the



13   credibility of W, but not in terms of character.  You can't



14   show propensity to violence.



15            B -- or A at this point in time may take advantage of



16   Witness W for the purposes of, number one, solidifying their



17   position within the trial as less culpable or their state of



18   mind.  They may attack the witness totally unrelated to the



19   B -- to the limited purposes evidence but to begin develop



20   state of mind evidence such as you knew this man, too, you've



21   indicated to the prosecution you knew him.  Isn't he bad?



22   Doesn't he take drugs?  Were you afraid?  Weren't you fearful?



23   And by connecting that way, you're saying, I was, too.



24            For your purpose of state of mind right at that point,



25   there's cross-instruction.  You're telling the jury don't







                                            81



     David Wymore - Direct



1   consider his propensity or his character on this crime.



2   However, as it goes to A, his character is relevant to A's



3   state of mind.  Then as it transposes over -- the jury is going



4   to resolve the issue in the guilt phase.  They are going to



5   come to a conclusion, he's bad or he's not bad or he's a liar



6   or he's not a liar or somebody is bad or not, just given that



7   one instance of character versus limited instruction.



8            It goes into the guilt phase -- it goes into the



9   penalty phase.  Right.  Then the instruction at that point in



10   time is you can't essentially say disregard everything you've



11   already resolved.  And now bad character can be mitigation for



12   A, but it can't be used to kill or give the death penalty to B.



13   It's a complicated package of instructions.



14   Q.  Let me stop you there.  Let me back up.



15   A.  It's a little complicated.



16   Q.  That's why I want to -- why couldn't that evidence be used



17   as -- explain your last statement.



18   A.  It's your mitigation.  It's A's mitigation.  It's A's



19   mitigation within posturing of relative culpability.  I mean,



20   as you look at the mitigators in the federal statute, you have



21   equal culpability, which means if you're less culpable, it's



22   even a better mitigator.  You have minor participant.  In the



23   reality of death litigation, you want to be less culpable.



24   Q.  So now A -- A will -- in the penalty phase will ask the



25   jury to consider that witness provided by W of -- of B's bad







                                            82



     David Wymore - Direct



1   character as demonstration that A is less -- was less culpable?



2   A.  Correct.  Minor participant.



3   Q.  Under a form of duress, on the one hand?



4   A.  Yes.



5   Q.  And on the other hand, the jury is not allowed to consider



6   that evidence of bad character for purposes of aggravating --



7   well, give me the other half.



8   A.  Since it's mitigation for A, it can't be aggravation for B



9   within the same trial with the same two jurors.  It's just



10   constitutionally infirm.  It's -- it's not a designated



11   aggravating factor by the prosecution that A was fearful of B



12   and that B was a person who had a mental illness, deranged



13   mind, drugs, everything else caused him to be fearful.  That's



14   not an aggravating factor that's to be presented either in its



15   nonstatutory or aggravated package to the jury as a reason to



16   give B the death penalty.  However, do I believe the jury is



17   going to use that one way or the other, yes.  Probably use it



18   adverse to B.



19   Q.  Let me give you another example that faces every defendant



20   in a capital or noncapital case -- it raises this problem --



21   and ask you to comment on that.  Does the defendant -- is the



22   defendant's decision to testify or not, is that affected



23   specifically in a joint capital proceeding in a way that would



24   be different in either a joint proceeding or a solo capital



25   proceeding?







                                            83



     David Wymore - Direct



1   A.  Absolutely.



2   Q.  And what are the factors there?



3   A.  Just in a single trial, the presentation your client gives



4   in front of the jury in the guilt phase can either essentially



5   give him life or give him death in the penalty phase.  How he



6   comes off, whether he's telling the full truth, if that person



7   delivers on the factual basis wrong, hesitant, doesn't answer



8   the questions well, and -- and in terms of cross-examination,



9   you know, just the entire thing.  It affects the penalty phase



10   because the jury judges you as a human being.  They are making



11   a judgment of you.  Am I going to convict you, am I going to



12   give you the death penalty.  They are constantly aware that the



13   second phase exists, so it affects you.



14   Q.  Okay.  In a -- specifically in a joint capital trial, how



15   will that --



16   A.  Specifically, in a joint capital trial, it's -- it's very



17   complex.  First of all, advising your client as to the basis or



18   expansion of cross-examination because you have an opposing



19   defendant who wants to posture themselves always as better than



20   you and less culpable than you, perhaps more helpful than you,



21   more cooperative than you, and it becomes this entire playout.



22   You have a hard time --



23   Q.  Let me stop you there.



24   A.  Okay.



25   Q.  All those issues you've just raised, more helpful than you,







                                            84



     David Wymore - Direct



1   more cooperative than you, less culpable than you, are those



2   relevant to the guilt phase determination?



3   A.  Absolutely.  I --



4   Q.  For the penalty phase?



5   A.  They are both.  If you testify in your trial as a



6   defendant, you're basically saying I didn't do it, I'm not



7   culpable, or I did it under some sort of infirmity, therefore



8   less culpable or I was a minor participant, less culpable, or I



9   was under duress, less culpable.  By taking the stand, you're



10   taking the position of relative culpability, okay.  Does that



11   make sense?



12   Q.  Yes, it does.



13   A.  Okay.



14   Q.  Does there -- does a problem arise of cross-examination of



15   a co-defendant?



16   A.  Yes.



17   Q.  How does that -- what happens there?



18   A.  Well, because -- because of that standard posturing, the



19   posturing that's going to take -- the necessary posturing



20   say -- and I'll use the example of not my defendant taking the



21   stand but the co-defendant or the opposing defendant taking the



22   stand.  The mitigating factors that are going -- that are



23   enumerated under the statute are equal culpability, minor



24   participation, duress, and it's basically posturing.



25            If the co-defendant is going to take the stand, I







                                            85



     David Wymore - Direct



1   would want to cross-examine him as to those issues that go to



2   the mitigation phase because I cannot allow him to succeed in



3   retaining or succeeding in having that posture of I didn't do



4   it, you caused me to do it, he caused me to do it, I was under



5   duress, all these other things that come out about my client,



6   state of mind, why he reacted, the reverse.  So therefore, I



7   have to cross-examine him, especially with the carryover effect



8   of guilt evidence into the penalty phase.



9            If the court protects him in cross-examination and



10   doesn't allow me to go into the issue of mitigation, the



11   evidence is going to be carried over into the penalty phase,



12   the impression.



13   Q.  Let me stop you there.  Couldn't -- can't you call him or



14   cross-examine him in the penalty phase?



15   A.  Not as far as I think you may have a Fifth Amendment right



16   in there.



17   Q.  Okay.  So he's got a right not to -- to be called again or



18   to testify?



19   A.  Right.  The issues may be different.  I don't know -- I've



20   never seen it happen where I, as a defense counsel, were able



21   to call up the defendant or a co-defendant to testify in the



22   joint penalty phase to give forward testimony whatsoever.  In



23   fact, in my case, I was blocked from doing that.  And -- and so



24   the problem is that you -- as you begin to cross-examine,



25   you're not limited or the co-defendant may not be limited in







                                            86



     David Wymore - Direct



1   the same parameters as the state is in terms of bringing out



2   certain things.



3            What may be important to you or your posture within



4   the penalty phase may be minor incidences of crime that have



5   some sort of effect upon your client's state of mind of why he



6   did or didn't do that that are not otherwise admissible.  So



7   the state may be limited in their cross-examination, but it



8   would be -- it would be tactically devastating to you if you



9   were because you weren't able to either attack and diminish or



10   remove that or put yourself into the better posture as it goes



11   into the penalty phase.



12   Q.  So you're forced as a co-defendant to cross-examine on



13   issues that have penalty phase relevance even -- even if they



14   are of marginal or no guilt phase relevance because of the



15   impact of the co-defendant's testimony at the penalty phase?



16   A.  Absolutely.  You're competing -- you're -- there's direct



17   competition between opposing defendants to be viewed better.



18   It's the reality of -- of death penalty litigation.  It's a



19   reality of jury sentence.  You've got to be less culpable, less



20   morally culpable than the co-defendant.  You cannot allow him



21   to live and be up there as a good person that was taken to the



22   cleaners by your guy.



23   Q.  Mr. Wymore, let's move on to the penalty phase.



24   A.  Okay.



25   Q.  Mr. Stevenson testified that he believed that there is --







                                            87



     David Wymore - Direct



1   would be difficulty in getting the jury to focus on the



2   individual defendant in a joint capital penalty phase.  Do you



3   agree with that assessment?



4   A.  Yeah, I do.



5   Q.  Okay.  And Judge Campbell testified that there is a problem



6   in a joint capital penalty phase of using mitigating evidence



7   against -- on behalf of one defendant as de facto aggravating



8   evidence against the other.  Is that your experience?



9   A.  Yes.  It happens even -- it happens even in single trials



10   where you're attempting to get an individualized determination.



11   The battle to keep mitigation from being aggravating and the



12   pains that are taken to make sure that the jury is clear that



13   that cannot be in a single trial is difficult.  In a



14   co-defendant trial, it's a racehorse.



15   Q.  Can you give us an example, using, for example, the --



16   using the calling of a witness, of a mitigating witness on



17   behalf of one defendant who testifies on direct only to



18   mitigating evidence about that calling defendant, how that --



19   the cross-examination of that witness might turn around the --



20   that evidence to act as an aggravator against the defendant.



21   A.  Certainly.  There's a lot of other problems that go along



22   with whether you're allowed to be in part of the other person's



23   mitigation case or whether or not you have a right to talk or



24   confront those problems not even dealing with those.



25            Say under the hypothetical, you call the defendant's







                                            88



     David Wymore - Direct



1   mother to establish that the defendant that -- that she loved



2   him, standard, typical mitigation evidence.  That he was there



3   for her, he was always good to the siblings, he had perhaps



4   some rough bumps but generally good character evidence.  Okay.



5   Co-defendant counsel, on seeing that as becoming the mitigating



6   factor of good family background and that your evidence is



7   establishing that by a preponderance of the evidence is now



8   losing potentially the jury in terms of what is mitigating.



9   Because you're in contention and if you're the co-defendant and



10   you don't have that mitigating factor, you have drug abuse,



11   maybe you even have intersexual abuse where you were abused and



12   became an abuser yourself in many different ways.  The



13   cross-examination by the co-defendant of the mother would be,



14   well, he had -- just like the judge was talking.  Didn't he



15   have a nice life?  Well, you didn't -- you weren't abusing him,



16   you weren't drinking, you weren't doing all this, you were



17   doing that.  You would set it off.  Where now, the mother is up



18   there testifying in -- and totally hard situation.  There's no



19   real program for witnesses to be mitigation witnesses.  And now



20   she's under attack in comparison to the co-defendant, and it's



21   necessarily he's going to have to do it because he wants to win



22   what is mitigating.



23   Q.  And fair to say that the result of that cross-examination



24   might very well be the nullification of that mitigating



25   evidence against the original defendant?







                                            89



     David Wymore - Direct



1   A.  Yes.  And what it is, is it becomes more of a -- of a -- of



2   a sideshow as to what is mitigating as opposed to what is the



3   burden of aggravation versus mitigation in the individualized



4   determination.  The co-defendants have to wage the battle in



5   the jurors' hearts and minds because you're asking for an



6   emotional connection to your mitigation case and then an



7   assessment from their own inherent moralistic values as to



8   whether or not you deserve to live or not.



9            So you now become in a contest as to really what is



10   mitigating.  And when the jurors are asking here -- and it also



11   plays to the advantage of the prosecution.  You heard it.  You



12   heard that was mitigating.  They will tell you two things at



13   the same time.  I mean, I can see myself doing it and I can see



14   it being heard in the argument.  Really, are any of these



15   mitigating?  The juror, after watching this display of attack



16   and parry and strike all the way through is going to say no,



17   there really is no mitigating.  There's only aggravation.



18   That's what we call nullification of mitigation.



19   Q.  And again, cannot that problem be solved by sufficient



20   judicial instructions?



21   A.  It's -- I do not believe in a realistic sense because you



22   ask for an emotional attachment.  You have jurors on your --



23   you need jurors who can hear your mitigation and the -- and



24   you're attempting to strike a semblance of mercy from them.



25   You're attempting to tell them yes, I have -- my client has







                                            90



     David Wymore - Direct



1   done a horrible thing.  And -- but your question is do you



2   decide that he dies and I want to tell you what his walk of



3   life is.  When you have two competing people with that, I mean,



4   you're basically showing -- or trying to attach and my



5   experience shows me that -- that jurors do attach emotionally.



6   Q.  Do they take their job seriously?



7   A.  Absolutely.



8   Q.  Are they trying as hard as they can to follow the judge's



9   instructions?



10   A.  Totally.  They do.  But here's the situation:  Say you go



11   second.  Say you're in seriatum --



12   Q.  Seriatum penalty phase?



13   A.  Right, in seriatum penalty phases where the -- the initial



14   co-defendant has gone through and already made the attachment



15   and received a life verdict from the person.  You're going to



16   ask that jury to reset their emotional clock back to zero.  You



17   can instruct, please reset your emotional clock back to zero.



18   The reality is not there.  They have made the bond and the



19   connection.  And you're going to tell them to reset their



20   inherent moral dial back to zero.  And it's just an unrealistic



21   burden on the jury.  It has nothing to do with the lawyers and



22   their ability.  It has nothing to do with instructions.  It has



23   to do with what is the realistic expectation of the jury to do



24   that.



25            I think that if you listen to all the testimony and







                                            91



     David Wymore - Direct



1   understand what jurors are telling you, that is a trying



2   experience to do, one, because it's a person's life in their



3   hands.  So to ask them to come back and go through it again,



4   whether it's in conjunction with the two of them or one or



5   together or one after the other, it's a very unrealistic and



6   demanding and unfair burden on the juror.



7   Q.  Mr. Wymore, in your opinion and based on your experience,



8   do you believe that a capital defendant can get truly



9   individualized consideration in a joint capital penalty phase?



10   A.  No, I do not believe he can get it.



11            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Pass the witness.



12            THE COURT:  Mr. Mackey.



13                          CROSS-EXAMINATION



14   BY MR. MACKEY:



15   Q.  Mr. Wymore, help me out.  I understood your testimony at



16   the beginning to say that federal law, like Colorado law, is a



17   jury decision death penalty statute.  Did you say that?



18   A.  My understanding is that a jury makes a decision as to life



19   or death.



20   Q.  And is that the current law in Colorado?



21   A.  No.



22   Q.  So the law you've been describing in your testimony is a



23   law that's since been amended?



24   A.  Yes.  July of last year.



25   Q.  Capital offense in Colorado, now that decision rests with a







                                            92



      David Wymore - Cross



1   three-judge panel?



2   A.  Three-judge panel, one vote for life.



3   Q.  You told the judge that in your comparison of the Colorado



4   and federal death penalty statutes, one difference jumped out



5   at you.



6   A.  Yeah.



7   Q.  Do you recall that?  That being the burden of proof as to



8   the proof of a mitigating circumstance?



9   A.  That's correct.



10   Q.  Do you remember in the federal statute that only one of the



11   twelve jurors need be convinced by a preponderance of the



12   existence of the mitigating circumstance?



13   A.  Are you -- are you talking nonunanimous -- nonunanimous



14   finding of mitigation?



15   Q.  Do you remember that provision in the federal death



16   penalty?



17   A.  I think it's in there, but I'm not going to tell you I'm an



18   absolute word expert on the federal statute.  Okay.



19   Q.  Okay.  That will be probably my last question.



20   A.  If that's in there, and what the discussion is that -- you



21   don't have to be in unanimity as to whether a mitigating factor



22   exists.  That, I believe, is in there.  And that's similar to



23   what Colorado was.



24   Q.  This case, Mr. Wymore, you know concerns two defendants



25   charged with the same 11 counts, currently charged together?







                                            93



      David Wymore - Cross



1   A.  I didn't know there were 11 counts.



2   Q.  And you have been describing to the Court what you from



3   your experience would describe as a parade of horribles if



4   those two defendants were thrust to trial together?



5   A.  I think they are realistic horribles, yes.



6   Q.  That "horrible" is a good characterization?



7   A.  Well, I mean, if you --



8            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Object to the characterization.



9            THE COURT:  All right.  I -- I don't know what



10   "horrible" means.



11            MR. MACKEY:  I withdraw.



12   BY MR. MACKEY:



13   Q.  Mr. Wymore, you have in your capital litigation experience



14   had one joint trial; correct?



15   A.  Yeah.  The last one in Colorado.



16   Q.  The Borrego case?



17   A.  Borrego-Lucero.



18   Q.  Yes.  Now more than nine years old?



19   A.  Yes.



20   Q.  The law has changed, has it not, Mr. Wymore?



21   A.  Which way?



22   Q.  In the area of capital litigation.



23   A.  In what manner?



24   Q.  Have there been other opinions from the United States



25   Supreme Court concerning selection of the jury and other







                                            94



      David Wymore - Cross



1   matters?



2   A.  Yes.



3   Q.  Mr. Wymore, many crimes are committed by more than one



4   person; true?



5   A.  That's true.



6   Q.  And your description is that in a single trial, somehow,



7   those difficulties can be avoided?



8   A.  In a single death penalty trial, yes.



9   Q.  Would it not be possible, Mr. Wymore, in a single death



10   penalty trial for the very same list of problems to occur?



11   A.  Hypothetically, yes.  But not necessarily to the magnitude



12   that they are going to exist, because they are not going to



13   have the problems of carrying joint instruction into the



14   guilt -- into the penalty phase.  So I mean yes and no.  Sure.



15   Q.  If you as defense counsel represented a single defendant in



16   a case generated by multiple defendant participation, two



17   people involved in the same murder, would you not in your



18   presentation first at the voir dire, throughout the guilt and



19   at the penalty attempt to shift blame to that second adjunct



20   defendant?



21   A.  If it called for that, yeah.  I mean, if that was the



22   defense.  Of course.



23   Q.  So finger pointing and comparison would go on in a single



24   trial; correct?



25   A.  You don't have the other finger pointing back in a single

      David Wymore - Cross



1   trial.  So you've got one whole half of it missing.  You're



2   basically pointing the finger and you're not getting it back.



3   Q.  You would seek, would you not, to call witnesses that would



4   demonstrate, for example, that your client was less culpable?



5   A.  Absolutely.



6   Q.  Mr. Wymore, your experience has been exclusively



7   representing criminal defendants; correct?



8   A.  Yes.  I'm a public defender.



9   Q.  Never been a prosecutor?



10   A.  No, I haven't.



11   Q.  Not set as a judge?



12   A.  No, I haven't.



13   Q.  And you ended your testimony by telling the Court that in



14   your view and in your experience, it would be impossible for a



15   fair trial to occur with more than one capital defendant.



16   A.  I believe so, yes.  Due to the concept of individualized



17   determination as to death or life.



18   Q.  Would that opinion, Mr. Wymore, contrast with the fact that



19   in the last five years, six federal judges have permitted just



20   such an event?



21   A.  Would it contrast with that?  It would contrast with that.



22            MR. MACKEY:  Thank you, Mr. Wymore.



23            THE COURT:  Anything else of the witness,



24   Mr. Thurschwell?

    David Wymore - Redirect



1   BY MR. THURSCHWELL:



2   Q.  In a single capital trial, Mr. Wymore, who -- what party



3   would be trying to destroy the capital defendant's mitigation



4   case?



5   A.  Well, the prosecution because its burden of proof has an



6   interest.  The opposing defendant has a great interest.



7   Q.  Well, in a solo single --



8   A.  Single.  Only the prosecution.



9   Q.  And in a joint capital trial?



10   A.  You're going to get it from two sides.



11            MR. THURSCHWELL:  No further questions.



12            MR. MACKEY:  None, your Honor.



13            THE COURT:  Are you excusing the witness?



14            MR. THURSCHWELL:  We excuse the witness.



15            THE COURT:  Agreed?



16            MR. MACKEY:  Yes.



17            THE COURT:  Mr. Wymore, you may step down.  You're



18   excused.  Thank you.



19            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Your Honor, we call Dr. Edward



20   Bronson.



21            THE COURT:  All right.  If you'll come forward,



22   please.



23            MR. THURSCHWELL:  With the Court's permission, I would



24   like to approach the witness and add exhibits there for use by



25   the witness.







                                            97







1            THE COURT:  All right.  The clerk will do it.



2            COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Please stand and raise your right



3   hand.



4       (Edward Bronson was sworn.)



5            COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Please be seated.  Please state



6   your full name and spell your last name for the record.



7            THE WITNESS:  Edward J. Bronson, B-r-o-n-s-o-n.  I'm



8   ready.



9                         DIRECT EXAMINATION



10   BY MR. THURSCHWELL:



11   Q.  Dr. Bronson, you were qualified as an expert before this



12   court before, have you not?



13   A.  Yes.



14   Q.  And that was as you were qualified for your expertise in



15   the application of social science techniques to legal issues



16   involved in selecting a jury?



17   A.  Yes.  I think that's a fair general characterization.



18   Q.  What is your current occupation?



19   A.  I'm still a college professor.



20   Q.  And where would that be?



21   A.  California State University at Chico, California.



22   Q.  Okay.  Would you please take a look at what's been marked



23   as Nichols' Exhibit D on the desk before you.



24   A.  Yes.



25   Q.  Could you tell the Court what that is.







                                            98



    Edward Bronson - Direct



1   A.  That's my curriculum vitae.



2   Q.  Okay.  And is this -- does this accurately represent your



3   employment, publications and accomplishments?



4   A.  Of relevant background, yes.



5   Q.  Okay.



6            MR. THURSCHWELL:  We would move the admission of



7   Exhibit D.



8            MR. CONNELLY:  No objection.



9            THE COURT:  All right.  D is received.



10   BY MR. THURSCHWELL:



11   Q.  Dr. Bronson, you have performed -- or sorry, you are



12   familiar with the literature -- relevant literature relating to



13   social psychological research on issues as they relate to



14   criminal trials; is that true?



15   A.  Yes.  But that's a pretty broad question.  I -- general



16   familiarity is about the most I claim.



17   Q.  Let me narrow it.  Are you familiar with the literature on



18   the ability of jurors to follow judicial instructions?



19   A.  Yes.



20   Q.  Okay.  Are you familiar with the literature related to the



21   severance of defendants and charges?



22   A.  Yes.



23   Q.  Okay.  Have you testified as an expert on issues relating



24   to social psychological research and their application to



25   jury-related issues?







                                            99



    Edward Bronson - Direct



1   A.  Yes.



2   Q.  About how many occasions have you testified?



3   A.  Well, if it's all of those things, perhaps 150 times or



4   something like that.



5   Q.  Have you testified as an expert on the severance of



6   defendants?



7   A.  Yes.



8   Q.  And when was the last time you testified as an expert in



9   that area?



10   A.  I think within the last few weeks.  Perhaps three or four



11   weeks.



12   Q.  Would you -- would you tell the Court the nature of that



13   case, please.



14   A.  Well, it was a -- a federal hearing involving several



15   defendants, four of whom were charged with the death penalty,



16   others charged with a whole range of other offenses.  And the



17   issue was -- there were several issues:  The severance of the



18   capitally charged defendants, the severance of the capitally



19   charged defendants from the noncapitally charged defendants,



20   and severance of other defendants from each other.



21   Q.  What -- are you -- do you know the result of the federal --



22   the capital defendants' motions for severance in that case?



23   A.  Yes.



24   Q.  What was that result?



25   A.  The judge did sever the capital defendants.







                                            100



    Edward Bronson - Direct



1   Q.  Each of them -- severed them together or each of them



2   individually in their own trial?



3   A.  They were all severed.



4   Q.  Individually?



5   A.  Yes.



6   Q.  Have you performed research on the issue of the severance



7   of defendants in joint capital penalty phases?



8   A.  Yes, I have.



9   Q.  I'm -- how many studies have you performed?



10   A.  Well, two major ones and then one rather limited study and



11   there's an ongoing study, but two that are in -- fairly



12   significant studies.



13   Q.  Have those two been published or presented?



14   A.  Yes.



15   Q.  Are you -- and you're familiar with the other literature on



16   this subject?  Of severance of defendants generally?



17   A.  Well, unfortunately, at the time I first got into this



18   field, there -- there wasn't any literature at all.  There are



19   related issues that have been explored by social scientists.



20   But at least to the best of my knowledge, there still aren't



21   any co-defendant studies, much less those that focus, as mine



22   do, on severance of co-defendants at the penalty phase of



23   capital trials.



24            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Your Honor, we would tender



25   Dr. Bronson on the aspect of effect of joinder of capital







                                            101



    Edward Bronson - Direct



1   defendants in a penalty phase.



2            MR. CONNELLY:  No objection.



3            THE COURT:  You may proceed.



4   BY MR. THURSCHWELL:



5   Q.  Dr. Bronson, let's talk about the two completed studies you



6   mentioned.  What was your methodology in -- well, let me back



7   up.  Was your methodology the same in both studies?



8   A.  Virtually identical.



9   Q.  Okay.  Could you describe to the Court that methodology.



10   A.  What I did was to -- in both of the studies, so I can



11   perhaps speak generically here.  I took the general scenario of



12   the case, each of which as it would happen involving three



13   co-defendants, all capitally charged.  I presented, at least as



14   written summaries of cases go, a fairly extensive factual



15   description of the guilt phase with instructions from the court



16   and -- and told my -- the people who participated in the study



17   that their jury -- that the jury in the case had unanimously



18   agreed that the defendants were guilty and then, given the



19   nature of California law, required to get to the penalty phase;



20   that the jury had also found them guilty of -- of what we call



21   special circumstances and we were now entering the -- the



22   penalty phase of the trial.



23            Then in order to test, which is the crucial



24   question -- in order to test as best I could the difference



25   between a joint penalty phase and a severed penalty phase, I







                                            102



    Edward Bronson - Direct



1   then divided up my respondents.  And perhaps I should clarify



2   who my respondents were.



3   Q.  By "respondents," you mean the individuals who answered the



4   questionnaire --



5   A.  That's right.



6   Q.  -- that formed the underlying data for your results?



7   A.  Yes.  They were a mix.  Approximately 35 percent or so jury



8   pool members.  The other group were undergraduate students.



9   One set of students at Fresno State University, the other at my



10   university, Chico State University.



11   Q.  Judge -- I'm sorry.  Dr. Bronson, let me stop you there and



12   ask you:  Why did you use both jury pool members and students?



13   A.  Well, that's -- that's a fair question.  Most of what we



14   know in social science, in social psychology comes from the



15   study of students.  Students are the typical respondents in



16   various studies for two very practical, earthy reasons.  First



17   of all, they are a captive audience.  Second of all, the price



18   is right.  That is, you can do a study with limited resources.



19   But there are always questions arise, some of them very



20   appropriate, some of them less so about whether students -- any



21   results that you obtain from a social science study using



22   students can tell us anything about people who aren't students.



23            It may well be that given students' lack of exposure



24   to the real world, their relative youth, that they are -- they



25   tend to be an age cohort and many other factors, it's very --







                                            103



    Edward Bronson - Direct



1   at least problematic about whether you can make that



2   projection.



3            Indeed, in the first study I ever did on juries when I



4   was still in graduate school here in Colorado, I was able to



5   use jury pool members given to me by jury commissioners to do



6   my studies, and I did it because I felt that there would be



7   some concern as to whether results obtained by testing students



8   would be viewed on as meaningful -- and being able to draw



9   general conclusions.



10            So in this case, I thought that -- it was much more



11   difficult to do the interviews of jurors.  And the way that I



12   got them was to get -- in both counties that I did my



13   experiments with, the jury commissioners furnished me very



14   gratuitously with the -- actually labels with the names and



15   addresses of jury pool members that had been selected for jury



16   duty in the one case in Fresno County and the other case in



17   Butte County so that I could paste those labels onto envelopes



18   and mail them, my questionnaires, with an appropriate cover



19   letter.



20            To get a big sample size was -- would have been



21   difficult to get -- the larger your sample size, the better



22   your -- the statistical power of whatever survey results you



23   get.  So I supplemented that actually with over half of the



24   respondents by using students.  But then I was able to separate



25   out the two groups, to look at students and how they dealt with







                                            104



    Edward Bronson - Direct



1   the experiment and to look at how people who were jurors or at



2   least who were in the jury pool and to see if what jurors did



3   was more or less equivalent to what students did.



4   Q.  And we'll come back to your -- the total results in a



5   moment; but preliminarily, did -- what were the results of that



6   study?  Did the jurors' correspond to the students' results?



7   A.  They were very close.  In one of the counties, I think it



8   was the Fresno study, the absolute levels of support for the



9   death penalty were, as one might expect, a bit lower among



10   students than among jurors, but that wasn't of particular



11   importance to me.  What I cared about was the difference



12   between those respondents who looked at the case in a joined



13   scenario versus those who looked at it in a severance scenario.



14   And in -- in that element, the students and the jurors were



15   virtually the same.



16   Q.  Okay.  And I interrupted you.  You were just -- you were



17   describing questionnaires and saying you had sent them both to



18   a set of jurors and a set of students.  Please proceed.  What



19   did you do with the results of those specific questionnaires?



20   A.  Well, it wasn't very complicated at that stage.  I had



21   asked certain questions.  The -- the most crucial question



22   was -- on the questionnaire, the survey instrument was to ask



23   them to vote after they had been given a reasonable



24   instruction.



25            I should say also in terms of methodology that I did







                                            105



    Edward Bronson - Direct



1   at least certain minimal steps to try and make my sample more



2   or less reflective of what an actual jury pool would be like.



3   Now, it -- for the jury pool members themselves, that was not



4   very difficult except that I added one further basis of



5   inclusion or exclusion, which was a simple death qualification



6   question.  It -- it was sort of a Witherspoon-type test, simply



7   asking them if they would always vote for the death penalty or



8   they would never vote for the death penalty or if they thought



9   the death penalty was appropriate in some cases, but not all.



10   And only those who were -- evidenced some open-mindedness on



11   that question by saying they thought the death penalty was



12   appropriate in some but not all cases were they included in the



13   analysis.



14            In addition, with respect to students, I had two



15   additional problems.  One was I didn't want anybody under 18,



16   for understandable reasons, so I excluded the few people in --



17   just a handful of college students who were not 18.  And then I



18   also wanted to exclude noncitizens to, as best I could, mirror



19   one of the important qualifications for -- for jury duty.  So



20   with those exclusions, then I analyzed the data as to the rest



21   of them.



22            You had asked me what it was that I analyzed.  The



23   first thing was I took a look at their penalty decisions.  They



24   were asked to then vote for life or -- and under California



25   law, it's life without the possibility of parole or death.







                                            106



    Edward Bronson - Direct



1   Those were the only two choices and are the only two choices



2   that you have in a penalty phase in California.  Then I asked



3   them to explain why it was they had chosen that particular



4   decision, what factors had influenced them.  We can look at the



5   exact language if you like, but I think that's a fair



6   characterization.



7            And of course, some of them had a joint trial in both



8   of the experiments where they were asked to decide on life or



9   death for all three defendants.  Others were given, for each of



10   the other defendants, a separate scenario where they had the



11   same guilt phase, all the same evidence about guilt, but they



12   only heard the aggravation and mitigation that -- at least the



13   penalty portion of that that was presented during the penalty



14   phase and then asked to vote only on one defendant.



15   Q.  Dr. Bronson, could you -- did your questionnaire address



16   the reasons that the individuals voted for or against the death



17   penalty?



18   A.  Yes.  That was an open-ended question where I simply asked



19   people perhaps read what it -- what it said.



20   Q.  But since you're reading, are you reading from Exhibit E?



21   A.  This is Exhibit E.



22   Q.  Okay.  Could you identify for the Court what Nichols'



23   Exhibit E is.



24   A.  That is -- that is a set of questionnaires --



25   Q.  Is that the -- is that -- are those the individual







                                            107



    Edward Bronson - Direct



1   questionnaires?



2   A.  Yes.  These are the -- these are the individual



3   questionnaires that were mailed -- this is only the -- the



4   juror questionnaire.  It's virtually identical to -- I think



5   maybe the only difference is that on the student questionnaire,



6   there was the citizenship question.  It's possible there's



7   another word or two, but it was virtually identical.  Also, the



8   students didn't have a cover letter explaining the purpose.



9   But this is the -- the actual questionnaire.



10   Q.  And before you go on, just to clean this up, in Nichols'



11   Exhibit F, is that the cover letter that you sent to the



12   members of the jury pool with the joint scenario that you --



13   questionnaire that you referred to?



14   A.  Yes.  Apparently, that is the -- so while I didn't look at



15   E carefully, I'm assuming that that's the -- the three severed



16   questionnaires and that F is the cover letter and joined



17   scenario, the composite version of the case that was sent.



18   Q.  Okay.



19            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Judge, we would move Exhibits E and



20   F.



21            MR. CONNELLY:  No objection.



22            THE COURT:  They are received.



23   BY MR. THURSCHWELL:



24   Q.  Okay.  You were about -- you were about to read from



25   Exhibit E the open-ended question regarding the basis for the







                                            108



    Edward Bronson - Direct



1   jurors' or mock jurors' verdict?



2   A.  Yes.  It is simply what are some of the reasons you



3   considered in making your decision.  In other words, first,



4   they choose between death penalty and -- or life imprisonment



5   without possibility of parole.  They check one or the other of



6   those alternatives.  And then they are asked what are some of



7   the reasons you considered in making your decision.  Jurors



8   with a joint scenario were asked that three times.  Jurors in



9   the severed versions had only one.



10   Q.  Did you analyze those results, as well?



11   A.  Yes.  I used a content analysis that is systematic review,



12   looking at -- I focused on just one issue in -- in looking at



13   that, the extent to which those who explained their verdicts



14   gave as it affected social history.  In other words, did they



15   talk about those qualities which you've heard the other



16   witnesses talk about this morning?



17   Q.  The individual defendants' background and --



18   A.  Yes.



19   Q.  -- life experiences.



20   A.  All those things.  Bad childhood, their age and maturity,



21   other -- their prior record, history of violence and things



22   like that that would affect the case.  These were fairly



23   different cases.  So the kinds of materials that were brought



24   in did obviously differ.



25   Q.  Okay.  Dr. Bronson, I want to turn now to the results of







                                            109



    Edward Bronson - Direct



1   your two studies, the Fresno study and the Butte study, and



2   directing your attention to what's been marked as Nichols'



3   Exhibit G.  Is this document a summary of some of the results



4   from those two studies?



5   A.  Yes, most of the results.



6            MR. THURSCHWELL:  We would move the admission of



7   Nichols' Exhibit G.



8            MR. CONNELLY:  No objection.



9            THE COURT:  Received.



10   BY MR. THURSCHWELL:



11   Q.  Turning first to page 1 of Exhibit G, Dr. Bronson, what do



12   the data represented in these tables represent?



13   A.  Well, the first part of this exhibit, which includes both 1



14   and 2 -- pages 1 and 2, simply look at a comparison of the



15   results from these two studies as to death penalty versus life



16   imprisonment, doing some comparisons between the joined



17   scenario and the severed scenario to see if that appears to



18   make some difference in how these respondents dealt with life



19   versus death in these two cases.



20   Q.  And what did your -- in laymen's language, what did your



21   results show with respect to the relationship between whether a



22   defendant was joined or severed and whether that defendant



23   received the death penalty?



24   A.  At least in the facts of these two cases, there was a very



25   large difference and from social scientists' point of view,







                                            110



    Edward Bronson - Direct



1   statistically significant difference, I think, in -- in all but



2   maybe one or two cases where it was marginally statistically



3   significant, but in most situations, highly statistically



4   significant difference between defendants -- the same



5   defendants judged in a severed condition as compared with a



6   joined condition and in the direction that without exception,



7   those defendants whose case was considered separately -- that



8   is, in the severed version -- were significantly less likely to



9   get the death penalty than those who were judged in a joined



10   scenario.



11   Q.  And was that statistically significant difference



12   registered whether you looked at the verdicts in the aggregate



13   or looked at individually named defendants?



14   A.  Well, both because clearly, an aggregate difference, if you



15   say that there are -- you've got five people and their average



16   income is $200,000, it makes a lot of difference if you have



17   one millionaire and the others are all homeless.  You really



18   don't get a fair sense of what these people are like.  So it is



19   important not to look simply at the overall, but at the



20   underlying data because it could be unfair to average it



21   together.  So I did both.  And those -- page 1 has the results



22   in the aggregate, and then page 2 takes each of the defendants



23   separately and looks at them.



24   Q.  Referring to Nichols' Exhibit G --



25   A.  Yes.

    Edward Bronson - Direct



1   Q.  -- turning to page 3, which is titled, Lumping Effects,



2   could you explain to the Court what a -- what you mean by



3   "lumping effects"?



4   A.  Well, it's the job of a good social scientist to give



5   elegant phrases to things, so I came up with "lumping effects"



6   here.  By that, I mean the tendency in any process, but here of



7   those evaluating life versus death in a -- in a penalty phase



8   of a capital trial, their ability to separate out the



9   defendants, to judge them individually, to judge the defendants



10   on what appear to be independent criteria.



11            Obviously, if there's only one defendant, by



12   definition, that is, relatively speaking, going to be an



13   independent judgment.  You may look out at the world out there



14   and compare this defendant with others, but at least in the



15   given trial, you've only got one defendant that you are looking



16   at.  And indeed, in California, it's improper to -- to allow



17   the defense, for example, to bring in what happened to a



18   co-defendant.



19   Q.  Turning your attention specifically to Table 5 on page 3,



20   how do you measure lumping effect?  That's --



21   A.  Well, I just used a fairly straightforward statistical



22   technique.  It's almost maybe too high-powered to call it



23   statistical.  It's a very simple little thing.  If you want to



24   know -- as in my case, to what extent are you likely to get or



25   should you get, if each of these events was independent, would







                                            112



    Edward Bronson - Direct



1   you get all three verdicts the same, all death, all life or a



2   combination of all three together.



3            If you want to know that kind of question, it's like



4   flipping coins.  If you want to know what are the chances that



5   you're going to flip with a fair coin three heads in a row,



6   then the technique, you multiply one-half times one-half times



7   one-half.  You would expect to get all three heads one time in



8   eight.  You would expect to get either all heads or all tails



9   twice that often.  That is one-fourth of the time.  That --



10   that means that they are independent, that the coin doesn't



11   have any memory, that they are operating separately.



12            So I did the same thing here and the -- the -- the



13   basis of determining what the likelihood is was based on what



14   my jurors -- and I use that to mean -- obviously, I'm not



15   talking about real jurors, but my respondents in this



16   experiment, to what extent they voted for death or life for an



17   individual defendant.  If they voted -- if it were like a coin



18   and in each -- each time one-half, then for each of the three



19   defendants, then I would expect that one-eighth of the time



20   they would always vote for heads, if you want to call that life



21   in the old Roman tradition, and that one-eighth of the time



22   they would all vote for death.  But I had real numbers because



23   I knew what my jurors had done in the severed condition.  And



24   that's shown on page 2 where I can look at each defendant



25   separately and see to what extent they voted for life and what







                                            113



    Edward Bronson - Direct



1   extent they voted for death.



2            So, for example, in Fresno, looking at Table 2, 60.8



3   percent voted for death for defendant Ricardo.  62.9 -- no.



4   I'm -- yes.  62.9 voted for death for this Defendant Juan.  And



5   60.8 voted for Carlos.  They were pretty close.  In the Butte



6   County experiment, they were different.  It doesn't matter.



7   You take whatever set of numbers you get.  You multiply them



8   together, and that gives me the expectation that it would be



9   all death.  And in this case, it was 9.6 percent.



10   Q.  23.3 -- I think it's --



11   A.  I'm sorry.  In Fresno, it's 23.3.



12   Q.  Okay.  Now, what -- what does -- what were your conclusions



13   regarding the lumping effect of the joined capital penalty



14   phase versus the severed penalty phase?



15   A.  Well, as you see, what I found was that whereas the -- the



16   expected number of all three defendants getting death was 23.3,



17   on the scenarios that the respondents had, that actually



18   happened 61.1 percent of the time.  In other words, about three



19   times what -- what one would expect if these were independent



20   decisions was actually happening.



21            Now, if you got a coin that was coming up heads that



22   often, you might suspect that there was something wrong with



23   the coin, especially if you did it often enough as I did here;



24   that in fact, they were not independent; that there was



25   something else going on.







                                            114



    Edward Bronson - Direct



1            Furthermore, when you added the percentage who were



2   expected to vote for life to that, you found that all three



3   voting for all three defendants getting life or all defendants



4   getting death was 29 percent.  It actually happened about



5   76 percent.  Once again, about three times as often.  That



6   suggests to me that there is some process going on here.



7            In both scenarios, which were quite different, where



8   the levels of -- of culpability both in the crime and in their



9   background was -- was different, in the one situation and where



10   involvement in the crime was -- was different, ages were



11   different.  In the other one, there still -- in both of these



12   cases, about three times the expected level of all three



13   defendants getting the same verdict.



14            Now, of course, that doesn't mean that they sometimes



15   didn't get separate verdicts.  It just means that there is an



16   inordinate pressure for -- in my experience, at least based on



17   these experiments, for juries to intertwine their -- their



18   decisions, to consider relative culpability and things of that



19   sort.



20   Q.  Dr. Bronson, how do social scientists account for something



21   like these lumping effects?



22   A.  Well, I don't know about social scientists generally.  I



23   can talk about some of the things that -- that seem to me to be



24   responsible.  You -- you can get generalization.  That is



25   stereotyping, birds of a feather type of -- of thinking.  Guilt







                                            115



    Edward Bronson - Direct



1   by association.  Making it very difficult to disentangle



2   what -- what one defendant did from another.  At least making



3   it more difficult.  I'm not suggesting that this is some sort



4   of automatic process or that all defendants will be found --



5   sentenced in the same way, either to life or death.  Only that



6   there are pressures that I would sus -- would -- I think are



7   probably unacceptable in a -- in capital case penalty decision



8   making in that direction.



9   Q.  Let me stop you there.  Might personal characteristics of



10   the defendants be among the factors that would tend to make



11   jurors lump them together?



12   A.  Yes.  And -- and the -- the problem with a -- a joint trial



13   is that it tends to reaffirm -- that is, to make concrete those



14   associations.  Such as a conspiracy, for example.  Here they



15   are sitting together.  That makes it less abstract than the --



16   the general charges or even evidence and contributes to that.



17   Qualities that they may share, whether it's their race, gang



18   membership, any one of a number of other qualities will -- will



19   go in the same direction.  If they are all perhaps the same age



20   are other factors that may tend to -- using that not-so-elegant



21   term, to lump them together.



22   Q.  Might -- might political perspective be among those



23   factors?



24   A.  Well, certainly.  To the extent that -- that we attribute



25   certain qualities to people who share a political perspective,







                                            116



    Edward Bronson - Direct



1   what some social scientists have called a master identity that



2   may override other qualities of people.  The best example of



3   that, of course, the one we're most familiar with would be race



4   where there's a tendency to think that all people with a



5   certain racial background or ethnic background tend to have



6   more in common than people who are members of that group



7   believe is the case.



8   Q.  Dr. Bronson, let's talk briefly about your findings on



9   social history, the background of a defendant and so on that



10   you described earlier on pages 4, 5 and 6 of Exhibit G.



11            On Exhibit -- on page 4, Table 6, it's titled



12   Percentage of Fresno Respondents Mentioning Defendants' Social



13   History.  Could you describe for us the findings in these two



14   tables, Table 6 and 7.



15   A.  Yes.  I had been exposed to the same sort of understanding



16   of the importance of social history in capital defense that the



17   defendant -- the witnesses who testified this morning



18   expressed, and so I thought it was important to see if that



19   was -- was a factor.  So what I found was that, as you can see



20   in Table 6, that my respondents were far more likely to say



21   something about social history in the severed version than they



22   were in the joined.  By that I mean they say something he



23   suffered as a child or he's young enough to change or some



24   other quality, that his parents didn't give him a good start or



25   whatever it is that -- that might be considered.







                                            117



    Edward Bronson - Direct



1            And as you can see in -- it's about twice as -- as



2   often.  In fact, when you combine the three cases, in about



3   44 percent of the severed scenarios, social history was



4   mentioned as compared with about half that, 23 percent, in the



5   composite scenario.  And as you can see below, these results



6   are all highly statistically significant, meaning that this is



7   not just some random relationship.  This is something that's



8   real.



9   Q.  I'm -- now, turning to page 5 --



10   A.  And by the way, I was just talking about Fresno there.



11   Just quickly saying there that it's true with respect to Butte



12   County, as well.



13   Q.  A similar strong correlation between mention of social



14   history and severed scenario for the defendant was -- was shown



15   in the Butte study, also?



16   A.  Yes.  That doesn't necessarily show that that's helpful.



17   It sort of expresses a notion that at least from what defense



18   attorneys believe, that that factor was more often considered



19   or written down as a factor in the decision by -- in severed



20   conditions than in joined.



21   Q.  Well, let's -- let's find out what -- what your findings



22   were on the -- whether -- the mention of social history was



23   helpful, to use your word, for the capital defendant.  And



24   turning your attention to page 5, Tables 8 and 9, could you



25   explain to the Court what these tables represent.







                                            118



    Edward Bronson - Direct



1   A.  Yes.  This -- this is showing -- dividing up into death



2   penalty verdicts and life verdicts.  LWOP is the phrase we use



3   in California for life without possibility of parole.  Among



4   those who noted social history, 63.3 percent gave death penalty



5   verdicts.  Among those who did not note social history, 72.9



6   percent gave death verdicts, a difference of 10 or 11 percent,



7   a difference that was statistically significant, and 10 or



8   11 percent, that's -- in baseball terms, that's 100 percent --



9   100 points higher batting average which maybe we can relate to



10   in Denver.  And in a jury, it's a little over one person per



11   jury.



12   Q.  Okay.  All right then.  Now, let's turn finally to page 6



13   and Tables 10 and 11 titled Impact on Fresno Respondents in the



14   first table -- Impact on Fresno Respondents of Defendants'



15   Social History Composite versus Severed Scenarios.  What do



16   these tables demonstrate?  What are they meant to -- to show?



17   A.  Well, while we've talked about social history in general,



18   whether in a severed or -- or joined trial, here I'm breaking



19   out the way social history was used at -- and comparing served



20   versus composite scenarios or joined trials to see if a joined



21   scenario affects the extent to which that will also affect the



22   ultimate decision in life versus death, which would seem



23   logical in view of other things we've said.  So as we look at



24   the defendants --



25   Q.  Let me just stop you there to clarify.  So what this table







                                            119



    Edward Bronson - Direct



1   demonstrates is the effect of joinder on the relationship



2   between the respondents' mentioning of social history and their



3   decision whether or not to give death?  Is that fair?



4   A.  Yes.



5   Q.  Okay.



6   A.  And what we see is -- if we look at the defendants, you're



7   looking at Ricardo first.  The -- in the composite scenario of



8   those voting for life who noted social history -- they did



9   both -- what we find is that 33-1/3 percent gave that decision



10   for him.  In the severed scenario, it went to almost a half.



11   48.6 percent.  That is, the severed scenario provided extra



12   force to the use of social history and the finding of a life



13   verdict.  The only one where that wasn't true in the Fresno



14   case is Defendant Juan.



15   Q.  Let me stop you there just to clarify for the record.  For



16   Juan, underneath where the -- the table where it indicates



17   whether the results were statistically significant, there's an



18   indication of NS where the others have a P, probability



19   indicated.  Does that NS mean not statistically significant?



20   A.  Yes.  There was no significance there, but I think it's



21   important to explain it because, to me, it adds validity to



22   everything else, which seems strange in view of the fact that



23   the results don't support my hypothesis, because with all the



24   other defendants, the -- the severed scenario and the use of



25   social history seems to lead to -- to life.







                                            120



    Edward Bronson - Direct



1            But the key thing is that in the Fresno scenario, two



2   of the defendants were young.  One was perhaps 19, the other in



3   his early twenties.  Juan, however, was 30-some-odd.  34 or



4   something like that.  But given the way I coded the data, if



5   somebody mentions the age of the defendant, then I use that as



6   a -- an element of the use of social history.  But clearly,



7   people who talked about Juan's age in this case meant that it



8   was, at least in their own mind, whatever the law might have



9   allowed was aggravating.  It didn't lead to life.  It led to



10   death.



11   Q.  So this is -- to use Judge Campbell's words, this is an



12   example -- age in your scenario was an example of a factor that



13   could be used either as a mitigator or aggravator depending on



14   the jury's perspective?



15   A.  That's right, but more than that, this shows the comparison



16   because I think what he was suggesting was that somebody might



17   want to take the fact that somebody was 21 and use it as an



18   aggravator.  I think that is a little unusual.  Ordinarily,



19   youth is a -- a mitigator and in fact, at least in my state, it



20   would be -- it is used that way, but let's not belabor that.



21   But here, they are using the -- the greater maturity, the older



22   age, the relative greater moral development or expected moral



23   development as an aggravator.  So in that limited circumstance,



24   social history is not helpful, but it really confirms the



25   hypothesis rather than undercuts it.







                                            121

20                    DIRECT EXAMINATION CONTINUED



21            THE COURT:  Please be seated.



22   BY MR. THURSCHWELL:



23   Q.  Dr. Bronson, based on your research and knowledge, is it



24   your view that a capital defendant joined with other capital



25   defendants in a penalty phase hearing has a greater likelihood







                                                                 125



                         Edward Bronson - Direct



 1   of receiving a death penalty than the very same defendant who



 2   was tried in a severed penalty phase hearing?



 3   A.  Yes.



 4   Q.  Is it your opinion that a capital defendant joined in a



 5   joint penalty phase hearing will receive -- has a greater



 6   chance to be lumped with other co-defendants and therefore has



 7   a lesser chance of receiving the individualized consideration



 8   that the Supreme Court requires?



 9   A.  Yes.



10   Q.  Is it your opinion based on your research and knowledge



11   that a juror considering a joined capital defendant in a



12   penalty phase hearing is less likely to use that capital



13   defendant's social history in considering whether or not to



14   render a death verdict?



15   A.  Yes.



16   Q.  And based on your answers in particular to the last two



17   questions along with your research, knowledge and experience,



18   is it your opinion that a joined -- the verdict in a joined



19   capital penalty phase hearing is likely to be less reliable



20   than a verdict for a particular defendant in a severed penalty



21   phase hearing?



22   A.  Yes.



23            MR. THURSCHWELL:  No further questions.



24            THE COURT:  Mr. Connelly.



25                          CROSS-EXAMINATION







                                                                 126



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   BY MR. CONNELLY:



 2   Q.  Good afternoon, Dr. Bronson.



 3   A.  Hello again.



 4   Q.  I believe we first met back in Oklahoma City when you



 5   testified in the venue hearing; is that right?



 6   A.  That's right.



 7   Q.  Most of your career, apart from teaching at Chico State,



 8   has been spent trying to lend social science support to the



 9   cause of capital criminal defendants; is that right?



10   A.  It doubt it has had that effect.  I suppose we could differ



11   with the implications of the question; but I'm not going to



12   fight that -- you.



13   Q.  And you're personally opposed as a matter of personal



14   decision to the death penalty.



15   A.  That's correct.



16   Q.  And you have never testified on behalf of the prosecution



17   on any issue in a capital proceeding; is that correct?



18   A.  In a capital proceeding?  I've had murder cases, but I



19   don't think any of them were capital.



20   Q.  So you've never testified on behalf of the prosecution on



21   any issue in a capital proceeding.



22   A.  No, but I'm willing.



23   Q.  We'll get to that later.  Let's talk later.



24            You spent many years of your professional life,



25   especially the early years here in Colorado, trying to







                                                                 127



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   establish death-qualified juries were more conviction prone and



 2   hence unfair to the defense?



 3   A.  Well, when you say "trying to establish," if we could maybe



 4   characterize it a little more even-handedly.  I began that with



 5   a hunch that indeed it may be true in response to the



 6   Witherspoon decision that death-qualified juries are unfair;



 7   and then the research spoke for itself.



 8            But to say that I began to try and show that, it



 9   really isn't quite fair.



10   Q.  Okay.  Your work, in any event, in the form of attitude



11   studies was before the U.S. Supreme Court in Lockhart vs. 



12   McCree; is that correct?



13   A.  That's correct.



14   Q.  And in fact the Supreme Court summarily rejected your work



15   as unworthy of consideration; is that correct?



16   A.  No, they didn't do that.  In fact, the Chief Justice



17   assumed for purposes of the decision that the work showed what



18   it said it did.  I don't think he really believed that, but



19   that's what he said.



20            And then he said even if that's true, it wasn't enough



21   to make the death-qualified jury unconstitutional.



22   Q.  So the Supreme Court did not summarily reject your work as



23   unworthy of consideration?



24   A.  I don't think that's what they said.



25   Q.  Okay.  Professor, have you written a chapter in a book







                                                                 128



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   called Jury Work on the death penalty?



 2   A.  On death qualification.  I think that's what you're



 3   referring to.



 4   Q.  Is the overall chapter entitled -- Chapter 23, "Death



 5   Penalty"?



 6   A.  If that's what the title says, but it's not a general



 7   chapter on the death penalty.



 8            MR. CONNELLY:  Maybe I should mark this.  We've got



 9   No. 11.



10            THE COURTROOM DEPUTY:  What do you want it marked?



11            MR. CONNELLY:  11.  Government 11.



12            THE WITNESS:  Thank you.



13   BY MR. CONNELLY:



14   Q.  Professor, does that look familiar to you?



15   A.  Yes.  As you see, it's on death qualification.



16   Q.  And the overall Chapter 23 is entitled "Death Penalty"; is



17   that correct?



18   A.  Yes.



19   Q.  Could you flip to page 23.70 on that.  It's actually the



20   second page of the excerpt.



21   A.  Just the second page?



22            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Judge, I'm going to object to this



23   as -- on the basis that the Supreme Court opinion in Lockhart 



24   vs. McCree speaks for itself.



25            THE COURT:  I didn't know we were looking at a Supreme







                                                                 129



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   Court opinion.  I thought we were looking at a chapter authored



 2   by the witness.



 3            MR. CONNELLY:  That's correct, your Honor.



 4            THE COURT:  All right.



 5   BY MR. CONNELLY:



 6   Q.  Under the subheading A, could you read that first



 7   paragraph?  It's two sentences, I believe, and it's discussing



 8   the Lockhart opinion; isn't that right?



 9   A.  Yes.



10   Q.  Could you read aloud those first two?



11   A.  Yes.  That's exactly what they said:  "The court in



12   Lockhart started with 15 studies that had been introduced into



13   evidence and concluded that only one study was worthy of



14   consideration.  The attitude studies were summarily rejected."



15   Q.  And that was your words; is that not correct?



16            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Objection, your Honor.  If what's



17   trying to be established here is in fact that the Supreme Court



18   summarily rejected --



19            THE COURT:  No.  I think what's being established or



20   attempted to be established is what this witness said about the



21   Lockhart opinion at an earlier time.  Is that right?



22            MR. CONNELLY:  That is correct, your Honor.



23            THE COURT:  Okay.



24            THE WITNESS:  Yes.



25   BY MR. CONNELLY:







                                                                 130



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   Q.  Okay.  So your position as written in that work is that the



 2   Supreme Court summarily rejected your work as unworthy of



 3   consideration?



 4   A.  Well, they -- that's what the conclusion is; but that



 5   isn't, I think, accurate characterization.  In other words,



 6   attitude studies are different from conviction-prone studies.



 7   And what the court said was that a study testing attitude,



 8   which is what I did, pro prosecution attitudes in some of those



 9   early studies, did not prove the case in terms of conviction



10   proneness, so that it didn't address the question that was



11   directly before the court.



12            In that sense, this is true.



13   Q.  So is it true, or not, as you wrote in there -- is it your



14   opinion as you wrote in there, or not, that the Supreme Court



15   summarily rejected your attitude study as unworthy of



16   consideration?  Is that what you wrote?



17   A.  On the question of whether the death penalty -- the



18   death-qualified jury was unconstitutional.  To that extent, it



19   is true.  They were not irrelevant in terms of what they



20   purported to be.



21   Q.  Did the court's opinion in Lockhart -- and you've read



22   Lockhart; is that correct?



23   A.  It's been awhile, but yes.



24   Q.  Did the court's opinion in Lockhart speak more generally to



25   the uses and value of social science studies in evaluating the







                                                                 131



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   impact of jury decision-making in actual cases?



 2   A.  I'm sure it did.  I don't remember the exact language.  I



 3   think the court was somewhat skeptical of the value of such



 4   work.



 5   Q.  And is it a fact, Professor -- do you recall the court



 6   writing at page 171 of volume 476 that all three of the new



 7   studies were based on the responses of individuals randomly



 8   selected from some segment of the population but who were not



 9   actual jurors sworn under oath to apply the law to the facts of



10   an actual case involving the fate of an actual criminal



11   defendant?  Is that right?  Do you recall that?



12   A.  That seems consistent with the general approach, yes.  I



13   don't remember the exact words.



14   Q.  Do you recall the court writing that it had serious doubts



15   about the value of these study predicting the behavior of



16   actual jurors?



17   A.  If you're reading from the opinion, of course, I'm sure



18   it's accurate.



19   Q.  You recall that as the thrust of the court's opinion?



20   A.  The thrust, I do recall, yes.



21   Q.  I'd like to move on to the severance issue.  You talked a



22   lot, I think, in your direct examination and in your affidavit



23   about the Fresno and Butte County studies; is that correct?



24   A.  That's correct.



25   Q.  But actually, the first study that you did of capital







                                                                 132



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   co-defendants, severance, was in a San Diego case called Ayala;



 2   is that correct?



 3   A.  That's correct.



 4   Q.  And isn't it true, Professor, that your survey in that case



 5   showed, contrary to your testimony today, that respondents



 6   could make an individualized judgment in a capital sentencing



 7   proceeding as long as they were given the facts to



 8   individualize among defendants?



 9   A.  My testimony to that?  That would not have been what that



10   research tended to show.  It showed some tendency -- I think I



11   better just explain.  I don't remember exactly what I



12   testified, but let --



13   Q.  I guess if you could and the question:  Do you recall the



14   testimony showing that respondents could individualize in a



15   joint penalty proceeding?  Do you recall testifying to that



16   effect in that Ayala case?



17   A.  I would say the same thing today.  It's not precluded.



18   It's just interfered with.  It's made more difficult.  That's



19   all.



20   Q.  Didn't your study in Ayala show that the respondents, in



21   fact, did individualize as to the penalty phase?



22   A.  Well, I'd have to answer in the same way.  What I found was



23   a tendency for -- that case involved two brothers -- a tendency



24   to cross-attribute qualities of one defendant to the other;



25   that it muddled their decision-making.  They said things like







                                                                 133



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   as part of that little study that a -- they agreed with the



 2   notion that an older brother can influence a younger brother



 3   and that that would affect the way the younger brother would



 4   behave.  They had difficulty with that.  But that didn't mean,



 5   of course, that they were disabled from considering them, at



 6   least to some extent, as separate.



 7   Q.  The problem you identified in that case was that it was two



 8   brothers who happened to be of a minority race.  Those were the



 9   two key factors in your testimony there; right?



10   A.  That's right.



11   Q.  And your testimony there said that they could not



12   individualize as to the guilt phase but they could



13   individualize as to the penalty phase.  Was that not your



14   testimony?



15   A.  Yes, but I have to tell you that the study that I did



16   there, I would be the first to confess was a very limited study



17   done on the eve of the hearing with -- in a very, very



18   difficult way, using survey research, because it was the only



19   way that we could deal with it and where it was almost



20   impossible to present respondents with a scenario of the trial



21   over the phone in a way that would be useful.  So we had little



22   bits and pieces of attempts to try and get at this problem; and



23   it was very, I think, unsatisfactory.



24   Q.  You didn't tell the San Diego court in that case that your



25   study was flawed, did you?







                                                                 134



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   A.  Oh, it was pretty clear that it was a very limited study.



 2   The most powerful evidence in that case was not my study at



 3   all.  It was the testimony of attorneys who had tried joined



 4   defendants in capital cases.



 5   Q.  Well, if you could look again at Exhibit 11.  That, again,



 6   is your own work in the death penalty book.  Is that not



 7   correct?



 8   A.  This is Chapter 23, yes.



 9   Q.  23.  And Chapter 23.05 talks about severance motions when



10   the co-defendants are related; is that right?



11   A.  Well, if this is mine, I would not have written that part



12   of it.  Let's see.



13            This is chapter -- didn't I write chapter 22 in this



14   book, not 23?  I don't think I even wrote 23.



15   Q.  Okay.



16   A.  I wrote the one that preceded it.



17   Q.  Okay.  Could you look on your rsum.  Your CV is, I



18   believe, Exhibit A.



19   A.  I hope it says 22.



20   Q.  See Exhibit A.  I think it's on page 2, the



21   next-to-the-last entry on that page.



22            THE COURT:  Exhibit A, did you say?



23            MR. CONNELLY:  I think it's Exhibit A.



24            THE COURT:  No.  D.



25            MR. CONNELLY:  D.  I'm sorry.  His CV, in any event.







                                                                 135



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1            THE COURT:  Yes.



 2            THE WITNESS:  Chapter 23.  It sure says that.



 3   BY MR. CONNELLY:



 4   Q.  So that is, in fact, your writing, or at least it purports



 5   to be, under your CV?



 6   A.  That's right.  But the part that I dealt with would have



 7   been the portion that was the critique of the -- the decision



 8   in Lockhart.  That was my responsibility.  I'm a joint -- I



 9   wasn't just a joint author.  I had an editor who took the



10   earlier materials and used them; but my major job was -- well,



11   it would be -- I wish I could help you more.



12            I don't know if this is updated since I wrote -- this



13   is one of those notebook-type publications that's reissued, and



14   I would have to know -- I do the -- oh, here it is.  1992



15   edition.



16            Well, I hate to sound so confused.



17   BY MR. CONNELLY:



18   Q.  In any event, I guess Section 23.05 deals with your



19   testimony and expert opinion in the San Diego case?



20   A.  That's correct.  I apologize for that.  It's just whether I



21   wrote this.



22   Q.  But it deals with your testimony and the social science



23   testimony presented in the San Diego case?



24   A.  Yes.



25   Q.  And it doesn't say if it's flawed.  It says that's a model







                                                                 136



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   for obtaining defense severance motions, does it not?



 2   A.  My study was?



 3   Q.  Yes.  Isn't it put in that chapter as a model for defense



 4   lawyers on how to gain severance?



 5   A.  It would not have been by me.  The portion -- the portion



 6   that was the model was the use of attorneys to talk about their



 7   experience with related defendants in capital cases.



 8            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Judge, I'm not finding where it says



 9   that this was a model.



10   BY MR. CONNELLY:



11   Q.  If you look, Professor Bronson, at page 23.83, subsection



12   B, it talks about expert witnesses who testified based on a



13   survey designed by the national jury project, and footnote 87



14   identifies you as the -- one of the witnesses who testified.



15   Is that not right?



16   A.  Yes.  And I'm clear I didn't write this.  I would never



17   have referred to myself that way as J.D., Ph.D.  That came from



18   an article that was written by a woman with the National Jury



19   Project who publishes this volume, Lois Heeney; and she did



20   write such an article; but I had no part of it.



21   Q.  But in any event --



22            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Object to the characterization of



23   "model."  I don't think the word appears here.



24            MR. CONNELLY:  Your Honor, the word "model" does not



25   appear.  It was not meant to be a verbatim quote.  The point is







                                                                 137



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   it was set out in the book as a way --



 2            THE COURT:  "Modeled" is your word.



 3            MR. CONNELLY:  That is my word.  I do not want to



 4   suggest that that word appears in the book.

 6   Q.  But that was set out in that chapter to illustrate for



 7   defense lawyers how social science testimony was successfully



 8   used to obtain severance?



 9   A.  Yes.



10   Q.  And nowhere in that chapter does it talk about the survey



11   and the testimony being flawed?



12   A.  No, but I didn't write it.  I don't want to claim that I



13   said that.  In fact, I've said quite the opposite.



14   Q.  It's part of a chapter that you claim that you authored --



15            THE COURT:  I think we've been on this long enough.



16   BY MR. CONNELLY:



17   Q.  In that San Diego case, Professor Bronson -- and this is



18   something else we've been on, but I just wanted to confirm:  Is



19   it true, or not, that your testimony showed that the



20   respondents did, in fact, individualize as to the penalty phase



21   decision?



22   A.  I'm sure they did, but I don't have any direct



23   recollection.  I haven't looked at that research.  That must



24   have been done on a -- back in the 80's, and I haven't looked



25   at it since.  I did not think it was great research then and I







                                                                 138



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   certainly don't now.



 2   Q.  So you would agree, though, that these -- it showed they



 3   could individualize?



 4   A.  As I say, I don't remember.  I'm sure it did to some



 5   extent; but that's not the real issue.  The real issue is



 6   whether they can individualize as much in a joint situation as



 7   they can in a severed one.



 8   Q.  And you didn't attempt to explore that in your San Diego



 9   study?



10   A.  I think we did compare.  As I say, I haven't really looked



11   at that research or dealt with it.  I suppose I ought to go



12   back and read it, but I haven't for so long.



13   Q.  Okay.  If I would, Professor, let me show you your



14   testimony to refresh your recollection in the Ayala case.



15   A.  I'd be happy to.



16            MR. CONNELLY:  I'd like to mark that as Exhibit 12.



17   BY MR. CONNELLY:



18   Q.  If you would -- oh, you don't have that so you can't turn



19   to the page.



20            Turn to page 1246, if you would, please.



21   A.  Yes.



22   Q.  Could you read the first two questions and answers to



23   yourself to -- and ask if that refreshes your recollection.



24   A.  Yes.  That says exactly what you said.  Did you want me to



25   read it?







                                                                 139



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   Q.  Well, if you just read it to refresh your recollection for



 2   now.



 3   A.  Yes.



 4   Q.  And based on that, do you recall that your survey showed



 5   that -- in fact, at the penalty phase, your survey showed that



 6   individuals can individualize if they are given some basis for



 7   individualizing the decisions at a penalty phase?



 8   A.  Yes.



 9   Q.  So after doing your San Diego survey, which showed that the



10   defendants -- or respondents could individualize at a penalty



11   phase, when is the next time you did one of these surveys in a



12   particular case?



13   A.  Well, I did a much more serious survey, what, two years ago



14   or so, in the -- what's called the Butte County study that was



15   dealing with the case in San Jose.



16   Q.  So in between the San Diego survey that showed they could



17   individualize and the Butte County survey, you didn't do



18   anymore specific research on this issue?



19   A.  That's correct.



20   Q.  Nonetheless, even though you just had done a San Diego



21   survey showing they could individualize, you began your Butte



22   County with the hypothesis -- is your word -- that jurors could



23   not individualize; isn't that correct?



24   A.  That's right.



25   Q.  Let me ask about your survey methodology in this Butte







                                                                 140



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   County and I guess Fresno County survey.  They're both similar;



 2   is that right?



 3   A.  Almost identical.



 4   Q.  And two-thirds of the respondents in both those surveys



 5   were college students?



 6   A.  Yes.  I can look up the exact number, but it's something



 7   like that.



 8   Q.  Roughly two-thirds.  And the Butte study was administered



 9   to your own Chico State students; is that correct?



10   A.  A few were my own students.  Others were students at Chico



11   State but not mine.  Most of them were not mine.



12   Q.  And the Fresno survey was administered to Fresno State



13   College students?



14   A.  That's right.



15   Q.  And these students were basically asked to fill out the



16   survey forms before class; is that right?



17   A.  Generally in class.



18   Q.  In class?



19   A.  But not necessarily.



20   Q.  How long does a college class typically run these days?



21   How long is your college class at Chico State?



22   A.  50 minutes.



23   Q.  And how much time were students given in that class to fill



24   out the surveys?



25   A.  I think it took 15 to 20 minutes.  In that general area.







                                                                 141



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   Q.  So basically, it would be the beginning part of class and



 2   then they would get into whatever the class subject matter was?



 3   A.  Typically, that was the situation.



 4   Q.  And did you give four versions of this survey to each of



 5   the classes?



 6   A.  Yes.



 7   Q.  One of the surveys being a composite survey or joint



 8   scenario of all three defendants?



 9   A.  Yes.  I would interleaf them to see that each class had a



10   fairly -- you wouldn't give one class like an engineering class



11   one version and then give a social science class another



12   version; so each of the classes got fairly equal division of



13   the various scenarios.



14   Q.  One out of every four students in a class would get the



15   joint scenario, for example?



16   A.  Yes.



17   Q.  The next one would get defendant A and then defendant B and



18   then defendant C?



19   A.  That's correct.



20   Q.  And then the fifth student would get the joint version?



21   A.  Exactly.



22   Q.  But you didn't allot any more time for students that got



23   the joint scenario; is that right?  It was all done around the



24   same time?



25   A.  Well, yeah; but it was governed by the longest completion







                                                                 142



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   time; that is, the faculty member, if the faculty member gave



 2   it in class, which a large percentage did, would wait until



 3   everybody was finished.  Some allowed them to take them home



 4   overnight and fill them out and bring them back the next day.



 5   Q.  Well, what if a faculty member wanted to get on with his



 6   class, say, in Fresno State and somebody said, I'm not done.



 7   Do you have any indication whether or not he said, Well, keep



 8   going and you can just skip class, or what happened?



 9   A.  In talking to the faculty member who administered it, I



10   talked about length of time and whether there were problems,



11   things of that sort.  That, at least to the best of my



12   knowledge, didn't happen.  It didn't happen in any



13   administrations that I did myself.



14   Q.  So all the students, regardless of what scenario they got,



15   were basically given the same roughly 15 minutes to do it; is



16   that right?



17   A.  Well, that isn't exact -- they'd all be given essentially



18   the same time.  That is governed by however long it took



19   students to finish them.



20   Q.  And isn't it a fact that your composite Fresno survey, for



21   example, contained almost twice as many words, over 4,000, than



22   the individual survey scenarios?



23   A.  That is correct, so that the students who had the



24   individual ones would, almost without exception, finish first.



25   Q.  Are you aware of that personally, or how many of these







                                                                 143



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   surveys did you administer?



 2   A.  I was there for no more than perhaps three or four; and all



 3   at Chico State, not at Fresno.



 4   Q.  So you have no idea exactly what transpired in the



 5   classroom personally at Fresno State?



 6   A.  Well, except in discussing it with the faculty member who



 7   is in charge of them, who agreed to do it.



 8   Q.  Did just one faculty member at Fresno State hand out the



 9   surveys?



10   A.  Yes.



11            Oh, but he handed them out sometimes to some of his



12   colleagues.  He didn't administer them all, but they went



13   through him.  He administered a large percentage of them, as I



14   did; but he did not do it exclusively.



15   Q.  And the students with the composite survey were not only



16   asked to read twice as many words but also to render three



17   times as many decisions; is that right?



18   A.  Approximately.  That's probably -- that's true.



19   Q.  One of the factors that could lead to what you've called



20   lumping, I believe, is juror confusion; is that right?



21   A.  That's a possibility.



22   Q.  And that's particularly -- lumping is particularly likely



23   in your view as well when defendants are members of a minority



24   group; is that right?



25   A.  That's correct.







                                                                 144



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   Q.  And your survey fostered confusion in the Fresno case,



 2   didn't it?



 3   A.  Well, if it did, it didn't do so any more than in the Butte



 4   County case, where there were no minorities.



 5   Q.  Okay.  Well, in the Fresno case, you used three Hispanic



 6   defendants; is that right?



 7   A.  That's right.



 8   Q.  And two of them had the same last name, Alvarez.  Is that



 9   right?



10   A.  That's right.



11   Q.  And all three of the members were -- all three of the



12   fictitious defendants were members of the same gang?



13   A.  That's right.



14   Q.  And the individual respondents saw no real distinction



15   among the three defendants.  Each of them were sentenced to



16   death in individual cases about 60 percent of the time; is that



17   right?



18   A.  That's correct.



19   Q.  I'm interested in your mathematical computations, I think



20   in the charts you presented, whereby you extrapolated



21   conclusions and that your respondents were three times more



22   likely to vote for death in a joint scenario than in severed



23   cases; is that right?



24   A.  For all three defendants?



25   Q.  Right.







                                                                 145



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   A.  Yes.



 2   Q.  In the Fresno study?



 3   A.  But also in the Butte study --



 4   Q.  Right.



 5   A.  -- where there was no name confusion.  They were Abel,



 6   Baker, and Charlie.



 7   Q.  And in Exhibit G, Table 1, for example, I look at that --



 8   and I wish you would as well, if you have it in front of you.



 9   A.  Yes.



10   Q.  Table 1, first table on Exhibit G:  That shows that



11   defendants had a 77 percent chance, 77.8 percent chance of



12   getting death in a joint scenario; is that right?



13   A.  That's right.



14   Q.  And a 61 percent chance with severed?



15   A.  That's right.



16   Q.  You've extrapolated from those numbers, however, to find



17   that it's three times more likely that they would get death in



18   a joint case?



19   A.  No.  That's not true.  I mean those numbers, of course, are



20   part of the computation in an indirect way, but that's not



21   where I get that number from.



22   Q.  Well, if you look at Exhibit G, Table 5.  That's on page 3.



23   A.  Yes.



24   Q.  I thought your testimony was that in a joint scenario the



25   defendants were three times more likely to be sentenced to







                                                                 146



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   death.



 2   A.  No.  That's not what I said at all.  What I said was



 3   this -- and it is certainly confusing, so maybe I do need to



 4   explain it.  What I said was this:  In a joined trial, you can



 5   get a variety of results.  You could get death, death, death;



 6   you could get death, death, life; you could get life, life,



 7   death.  Those are all possibilities.



 8            Suppose you get death, death, death, for all three



 9   defendants.  Is the likelihood of getting that -- and that's



10   the only thing we're talking about.  That's the lumping I'm



11   talking about -- is that greater than statistical chance would



12   suggest?  And -- what I said was it was three times more likely



13   that all three defendants would get death -- death, death,



14   death -- than one would expect from the likelihood of what



15   respondents ordinarily decided was the appropriate penalty and



16   that the same thing to a lesser extent was true with all three



17   getting life.



18            In other words -- and I'm not sure if I've clarified



19   it.  It isn't just -- it isn't that they're three times more



20   likely to get death.  It's all three will get the same death



21   judgment is three times more likely than one would expect from



22   in severed versions those defendants got the -- in other words,



23   let's compare it this way:  If you had three severed trials,



24   Defendants A, B, C, and what are the chances that A will get



25   death in a severed trial, B will get death in a severed trial







                                                                 147



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   and C will get severed death?  What are the chances that will



 2   happen?  In severed trials, all three will get death.



 3            The calculation was in Butte that it was 9.6 percent



 4   of the time.  I don't know if you need me to explain where that



 5   comes from.  In other words, about 10 percent of the time in



 6   three severed trials all three will get death.



 7            But if you join those three together in the same



 8   trial, what did I find happened?  And I found that in fact all



 9   three got death 36.9 percent of the time.  It was much more



10   likely that all three would get that same death sentence when



11   they were joined.  That's what my calculation has to do with.



12   Q.  And you said it was like flipping coins; that you were



13   just -- if they were really independent, there would be no



14   relationship between one death verdict and another?



15   A.  That's correct.  If they're individualizing, to do that is



16   totally possible, I suppose; but this was pretty dramatic as



17   the extent to which all three got the same death sentence.  And



18   they also got life more often; so to that extent, it would be



19   helpful, I guess, from a defense perspective.



20   Q.  If I could, I'd like to give you a brief hypothetical that



21   I'll try to keep simple, maybe match a little of your studies.



22   Assume that you had three defendants named Abel, Baker and



23   Charlie.



24   A.  All right.



25   Q.  And that they were three triplets.







                                                                 148



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   A.  Three what?



 2   Q.  Triplets.  They're identical triplets.



 3   A.  Okay.



 4   Q.  And that they had an identical role in the crime; that each



 5   of them raped and murdered somebody and in fact even shared the



 6   same murder weapon, which I think is what happened in your



 7   Butte case; is that right?



 8   A.  It's true, but that's one of the few points of real



 9   identity in that case.  Yes.  They were not related.



10   Q.  And assume that they had identical social backgrounds; that



11   each of them suffered the same sexual abuse, for example, in



12   their childhood.



13   A.  Okay.



14   Q.  And that is exactly what happened in your Fresno study;



15   right?  Each of the defendant's mitigation evidence showed that



16   they suffered similar sexual abuse by foster parents or an



17   older brother or a counselor; is that right?



18   A.  That was Butte, wasn't it?



19   Q.  Yes.



20   A.  Yes.  I think you said Fresno.



21   Q.  Okay.  Well, I thought -- I thought it was Fresno.  Didn't



22   they each suffer sexual abuse in Fresno?



23   A.  I know -- I'm pretty sure they did in Butte.  Fresno,



24   maybe.  If you've looked at it more recently than I -- there



25   were certainly parallels.







                                                                 149



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   Q.  So basically assume that the defendants had the exact,



 2   almost identical roles in the offense and very similar



 3   mitigation evidence.



 4   A.  Yes.



 5   Q.  And that you gave three individual scenarios; and as to



 6   Abel, he was sentenced to death 50 percent of the time; Baker,



 7   50 percent of the time; Charlie, 50 percent of the time.



 8   A.  Yes.



 9   Q.  And in a joint scenario, the respondents sentenced all



10   three defendants to death 50 percent of the time.



11   A.  That's right.



12   Q.  Would your flipping-coins example lead you to conclude that



13   the jury in the joint scenario was three times more likely to



14   sentence all three defendants to death than they would in



15   individual scenarios?



16   A.  That works out right.  In other words, if the -- if that's



17   happening, one would expect that what you would find would be



18   that all three defendants in the joined scenario would get



19   death 50 percent times 50 percent times 50 percent, or 1/8 of



20   the time, all three getting exactly the same penalty.



21   Q.  So that survey result would lead you to conclude that they



22   were three times more likely, these identical triplets, to get



23   death joined than severed?



24   A.  If 50 percent of the time the three defendants all got



25   death?







                                                                 150



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   Q.  Uh-huh.



 2   A.  Yes.



 3   Q.  I'm interested:  Your three surveys in the San Diego,



 4   Butte, and Fresno cases are really the only ones -- social



 5   science studies -- to address the issue of co-defendant



 6   severance?



 7   A.  To address it directly, that's true.



 8   Q.  Would you agree in the field of social science



 9   ground-breaking studies such as this are viewed with more



10   interest than studies which simply replow old terrain?



11   A.  They may, if it's an interesting topic or if it invites or



12   makes possible further research.  This is a difficult area to



13   study; and I've always been surprised that there was as little



14   research as there is, but that's probably because it is so



15   difficult to study.



16   Q.  And if a study has merit, it typically is published in a



17   social science journal; is that right?



18   A.  It's submitted if it's interesting, yeah.



19   Q.  To get published in a prestigious journal, a study must



20   undergo some form of peer review?  Is that right?



21   A.  Uh-huh.



22   Q.  Have any of your co-defendant severance studies been



23   published in a peer review journal?



24   A.  I haven't submitted it, though think I should.



25   Q.  In fact, the only place that your studies have been







                                                                 151



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   published is in Forum?



 2   A.  And the monograph series at the university.



 3   Q.  Which is sort of on file at the Chico State library?



 4   A.  And available, yes.



 5   Q.  And Forum is a magazine put out by California defense



 6   lawyers?



 7   A.  Yes.



 8   Q.  And prosecutors aren't allowed to subscribe to it; is that



 9   right?



10   A.  I don't know.  I'm sure you have availability of it.  I



11   don't know what the rules of publication are.  I would hope



12   that it's readily available.  It's certainly be offered enough



13   in cases that it is no mystery.



14   Q.  Would you be surprised if I told you that somebody called



15   today and asked to subscribe and they were told if you're a



16   prosecutor you're not allowed to subscribe?



17   A.  Well, subscription is one thing.  Reading it is quite



18   another.  It's indexed in the indexed legal periodicals.



19   That's how I first came across it.  And presumably it is in



20   most libraries.  I assume it's in law libraries and similar



21   places.



22            I think what it means is that maybe you can't be a



23   member of the California Public Defenders' Association, but I'm



24   not even sure about that.



25   Q.  Let me move on quickly to your opinions in this case, if I







                                                                 152



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   could.  Your affidavit stresses that you don't -- do not think



 2   that severance of co-defendants is required in every capital



 3   case; is that right?



 4   A.  That's right.



 5   Q.  Instead you suggest that it's only the special case with



 6   unusual circumstances in which severance is required even in a



 7   capital case?



 8   A.  Yes.



 9   Q.  I'd like to ask you if you would to give me hypothetically



10   a capital case in which two defendants could fairly be tried in



11   a joint penalty phase.



12   A.  It's difficult (1) because the more I work with it, the



13   more complicated it becomes for me.  On the one hand, for



14   example, if their penalty phases are different, advocating a



15   different theory of mitigation -- we talked about this morning



16   of competing theories.  One has an unblemished record as a



17   young person.  The other has a sorry childhood.  And in effect,



18   you're asking the jury to choose.  Obviously, that poses



19   difficulties.



20            On the other hand, if they have the same kind of



21   background, then -- then you get what is sometimes called



22   "dilution of mitigation," the notion that the first time a jury



23   hears a theory of "please save my life because I had a very



24   terrible childhood," the jury might be a little willing to



25   accept that, to feel special sympathy.







                                                                 153



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1            But when you go back again and ask that same jury to



 2   also save the life of the second defendant, then it might be



 3   more difficult.  And so you've diluted the mitigation theory



 4   that the defense offers.



 5            So my initial thoughts on that have gotten more



 6   complex; and so I guess my answer is that I have more



 7   difficulty with considering the myriad number of potential



 8   issues that complicate joinder in capital cases, because as I



 9   look at more and more of these cases where there are mutual



10   affiliations, confusion, etc., etc., relationships and so on, I



11   find fewer and fewer situations where I'm comfortable with



12   saying that joinder is okay.



13            Obviously, I would be inconsistent with the law if I



14   were to say that there ought to be some per se rule for joinder



15   in capital cases.  I don't think that's true, but it is surely



16   true that I have difficulty once I consider all the facts of



17   whether there are problems in a particular case.



18   Q.  So the short answer is if we want to hire you as a



19   prosecution expert some day, you can't tell me the case in



20   which you'd be willing to testify on behalf of the prosecution.



21   A.  It's really that I haven't thought about it.  The only



22   facts that I've been confronted with by and large have been



23   facts that seem to speak in favor of -- of severance.  But



24   maybe I do need to think more about -- think about what facts



25   that I haven't dealt with yet would not constitute a -- a







                                                                 154



                          Edward Bronson - Cross



 1   strong case for severance.



 2            And it's certainly true, and I don't want to back off



 3   of this, because it would be inconsistent with what I found and



 4   what I've seen:  Surely the fact that it's a capital case makes



 5   it a much stronger candidate for severance than anything else.



 6   And I've never dealt with any noncapital severances except in



 7   the case, for example, of some of those in New Mexico, where



 8   there were noncapital defendants joined with capital defendants



 9   and there were also issues of the severance of the noncapital



10   defendants.



11            MR. CONNELLY:  Thank you, Professor.



12            THE COURT:  Do you have any follow-up questions?



13            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Your Honor, we have no follow-up



14   questions, and the witness is excused.



15            THE COURT:  All right.  Agreeing to be excused?



16            MR. CONNELLY:  Yes, your Honor.



17            THE COURT:  You may step down.  You are excused.



18            THE WITNESS:  I want to give --



19            MR. THURSCHWELL:  There is a matter of three exhibits



20   that were attached as exhibits to our moving papers which we



21   have not moved in, the declaration of Dr. Bronson, the rsum



22   Bryan Stevenson, and the rsum of David Wymore.  At the



23   Court's pleasure, we could move them into evidence now, or we



24   could leave them as simply attached to the motion.



25            THE COURT:  Let's leave them as attached to the







                                                                 155







 1   motion, if there is no objection to that procedure.



 2            MR. RYAN:  No objection.



 3            THE COURT:  Do you have any further witnesses?



 4            MR. TIGAR:  We have no further witnesses on the



 5   severance motion, your Honor.



 6            THE COURT:  Mr. Jones, are you offering any witnesses?



 7            MR. JONES:  We are not, your Honor.



 8            THE COURT:  All right.  The Government have any



 9   witnesses on the motion?



10            MR. RYAN:  Yes, your Honor, we.  Have three witnesses.



11   The first one is Dr. Reid Hastie.



12            THE COURT:  If you'll come forward to be sworn.



13            MR. RYAN:  Your Honor, we've marked as Government's



14   Exhibit 10 Dr. Hastie's curriculum vitae, which Ms. Behenna is



15   handing to the court clerk.



16            THE COURT:  Please raise your right hand.



17       (Reid Hastie was sworn by affirmation.)



18            THE COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Please have a seat.



19            MR. TIGAR:  Your Honor, I just received Dr. Hastie's



20   rsum last night; and so I would ask that at the conclusion of



21   his direct, if we could take the daily break, I have somebody



22   ready to talk to me on the telephone to help me get prepared to



23   cross-examine him.



24            THE COURT:  All right.  Well, do you have any



25   objection -- 10, you said, was the rsum?







                                                                 156







 1            MR. RYAN:  Yes, your Honor.



 2            THE COURT:  -- to the admission of 10 so we don't have



 3   to go through it?



 4            MR. TIGAR:  No.  I have no objection to the admission



 5   of it.  It's just that I have not had a chance to talk to



 6   somebody about all of this lengthy publication list so I can



 7   ask halfway intelligent questions.



 8            THE COURT:  You want to have the recess before you



 9   cross-examine.  That's the question?



10            MR. TIGAR:  Yes.



11            THE COURT:  All right.



12                         DIRECT EXAMINATION



13   BY MR. RYAN:



14   Q.  Please state your full name.



15   A.  Reid Hastie, R-E-I-D, H-A-S-T-I-E.



16   Q.  And your occupation?



17   A.  I'm a professor of psychology at the University of



18   Colorado.



19   Q.  I take it you and your family live in Boulder, Colorado?



20   A.  Yes.



21   Q.  We have given his Honor a copy of your CV, and I'm not



22   going to go through all of the items.  I do want to touch upon



23   a couple of things, however, in your CV.  You have, have you



24   not, served on the boards of professional journals?



25   A.  Yes.







                                                                 157



                           Reid Hastie - Direct



 1   Q.  And what journals are those?



 2   A.  I'm afraid I'd have to look at the CV.  I actually updated



 3   the CV this morning, and I'm on some new editorial boards:



 4   Journal of Consumer Psychology; Journal of Experimental



 5   Psychology, Learning, Memory and Cognition; Journal of



 6   Experimental Psychology, General; Journal of Experimental



 7   Social Psychology; Journal of Personality and Social



 8   Psychology; Law and Society Review; Memory; Memory and



 9   Cognition; Organizational Behavior and Human Decision



10   Processes; Psychological Review; The Psychonomic Bulletin and



11   Review, and Social Cognition.



12   Q.  And what is your role as a member of the board of these



13   professional journals?



14   A.  The thing that I spend most of my time on is reading papers



15   and reviews of papers that have been submitted for publication



16   and making decisions about whether to publish them in the



17   journal.  Probably I misspoke.  An equal amount of time is



18   spent reviewing the papers myself directly and advising other



19   editors about their publishability, acceptability.



20   Q.  Thank you.  Have you, yourself, conducted research in the



21   field of psychology?



22   A.  Yes.



23   Q.  And into what areas have you conducted research?  Or to



24   shorten this a bit, let me ask you:  What has been the primary



25   focus of your research and writing over the past 24 years?







                                                                 158



                           Reid Hastie - Direct



 1   A.  I would say jury and juror decision-making.



 2   Q.  Have you ever conducted a study that attempted to measure



 3   whether or not a capital defendant was more likely to get the



 4   death penalty if -- in a joined trial as opposed to a severed



 5   trial?



 6   A.  No, I have not.



 7   Q.  Do you know of anyone who has?



 8   A.  I guess Dr. Bronson is the only one I know of.



 9   Q.  Have you attempted to research the literature to see if



10   there was other writings or research available?



11   A.  Yes.  I wouldn't commit to having absolutely thoroughly



12   researched it because I was called on this issue only at the



13   end of last week, but I've certainly taken a look through the



14   standard databases and reference books.  I found nothing else.



15   Q.  You, yourself, have published many articles, have you not,



16   though, in the area of jury decision-making?



17   A.  Yes.



18   Q.  In a variety of journals all as set forth in your



19   curriculum vitae?



20   A.  I'm sorry.  I missed --



21   Q.  In a variety of journals all as set forth in your



22   curriculum vitae?



23   A.  Yes, they're all cited in the curriculum vitae.



24   Q.  After Dr. Bronson was identified by the Nichols team as a



25   potential witness in this case, you were contacted last week by







                                                                 159



                           Reid Hastie - Direct



 1   the prosecution, Mr. Sean Connelly, to consult with the United



 2   States regarding this issue of severance.



 3   A.  Yes.



 4   Q.  And what were you asked to undertake?



 5   A.  I was asked to read the briefs that had been submitted by



 6   the various defense attorneys and the prosecution on this issue



 7   of severance; and included in that, of course, was



 8   Dr. Bronson's affidavit.  And that's -- and I was asked to



 9   evaluate specifically Dr. Bronson's research quality and his



10   conclusions.



11            And then was asked the more general question of did I



12   know of other research that would yield conclusions -- social



13   science research that would yield conclusions on the issues of



14   severance.



15   Q.  And have you undertaken that work?



16   A.  Yes.



17   Q.  And are you prepared to testify today with respect to your



18   analysis of Dr. Bronson's work?



19   A.  Yes.



20   Q.  Would you explain the -- what is meant by the term



21   "experimenter expectancy"?



22   A.  Yes.  It's a term that was introduced in the 1960's by a



23   researcher named Robert Rosenthal, and it's a summary label for



24   the biases that can sometimes occur when an experimenter



25   deliberately or inadvertently designs research that is biassed







                                                                 160



                           Reid Hastie - Direct



 1   to produce conclusions that the researcher assumes are true or



 2   expects to be true before they conduct the research.



 3   Q.  Prior to consulting with the United States in this matter,



 4   were you aware of Dr. Bronson's attitudes with respect to the



 5   death penalty?



 6   A.  Yes.  I wouldn't say I was well acquainted with them; but I



 7   was involved in another hearing with Dr. Bronson, and I heard



 8   his testimony and I guess I have a view that he repeated



 9   earlier today about his opposition to the death penalty.



10   Q.  And you're aware through his testimony today that he



11   testifies in a variety of contexts with respect to death



12   penalty issues?



13   A.  Yes.



14   Q.  In your opinion, is experimenter's expectancy a factor in



15   your evaluation of Dr. Bronson's study?



16   A.  Yes.  It's a consideration raised by my examination of his



17   affidavit.



18   Q.  Could you explain that to the Court?



19   A.  Well, there is one definite signal of Dr. Bronson's



20   expectancy, and it's a bit of a technical signal that I think



21   almost any expert reading the affidavit would note.  He follows



22   a procedure to establish whether or not his results are



23   statistically significant or reliable called a "one-tailed



24   significance test procedure."



25            This is not a weird or totally unusual procedure, but







                                                                 161



                           Reid Hastie - Direct



 1   it is certainly uncommon and unconventional and nonstandard.



 2   Several of the textbooks of statistics for behavioral



 3   scientists identify it as a procedure that is never, if -- or



 4   virtually ever justified.



 5            When the more, let's say, liberal textbooks discuss



 6   the conditions under which you might use a one-tailed test, the



 7   justification that is allowed is if before you conduct your



 8   experiment, you have a definite expectancy that result in only



 9   one direction or a no result is likely to occur, then the one-



10   tailed significance test procedure is warranted.  Otherwise, if



11   you are, if you will, more conservative or open-minded about



12   the results you expect might be produced by your research, you



13   would do the much more common standard two-tailed test.



14            And when I read Dr. Bronson's affidavit, I was



15   actually surprised to discover that throughout it, he followed



16   the one-tailed test procedure, so that the hypothesis, the



17   statistical hypothesis he was testing, was only whether the



18   joined groups would be more likely to convict or more likely to



19   confuse than the severed groups.  So by the choice of that



20   test, if he was an ethical researcher who follows the rules in



21   our statistics books, he is asserting to any social scientist



22   who read it that the result he is expecting and the result he



23   is testing for is either a no result or a result in the



24   direction of this -- you could call it "expectation" that he



25   stated on the stand earlier when he was cross-examined that the







                                                                 162



                           Reid Hastie - Direct



 1   joined defendants would be convicted at a higher rate and



 2   confused more often.



 3   Q.  Dr. Hastie, have you had an opportunity to examine the --



 4   to the extent that you can -- the materials Dr. Bronson used



 5   and the questionnaires that he used in connection with his



 6   Fresno and Butte studies?



 7   A.  Yes.



 8   Q.  And do you have a judgment that you could share with the



 9   Court as to the realism of these materials and procedures that



10   Dr. Bronson used in his experiments?



11   A.  Considering the spectrum of social science research on



12   juror decision-making, mock juror decision-making, I would say



13   that they are towards the low -- low fidelity end of realism



14   for social science studies of juror decisions.



15   Q.  Why is that?



16   A.  Well, there are a list of conditions.  I think most of them



17   came out in his testimony, so I will try to telegraph the list.



18   First of all, there was relatively little control over his



19   subjects' behavior.  The questionnaires were made to them to



20   fill out, ad lib at home, and then return at will, or handed to



21   them in classrooms where they were not carefully supervised as



22   to time and attentiveness to the task.  So it was a relatively,



23   we would say, low controlled experiment.



24            Second, there were no obvious incentives aside from



25   the desire to be a volunteer, the desire to cooperate, and







                                                                 163



                           Reid Hastie - Direct



 1   possibly the desire to have a vehicle to express a personal



 2   attitude about the legal system, to motivate subjects to



 3   perform the task.  Presumably, again, if the study was



 4   conducted ethically in the classrooms, the students were given



 5   the choice of participating or not.  That's a fundamental rule



 6   of all of our professional societies; that you can't coerce



 7   subjects into performing the task.



 8            And obviously, as I think it's clear from



 9   Dr. Bronson's testimony, there was no money incentive, no



10   authority figure, or other pressure to comply.



11            Similarly, as Dr. Bronson noted in some remarks and



12   especially in the affidavit with reference to research that has



13   studied jurors' capacity to comply with instructions from a



14   judge, this study is about as low pressure or low fidelity with



15   reference to the force with which the judicial instructions are



16   presented to the subjects.  I believe in the questionnaires



17   there was maybe 150 words at most out of 4,000 that were the



18   judge's instructions; and, of course, they were written in the



19   middle of this quite lengthy -- well, fairly lengthy for a



20   15-minute period questionnaire; so it was very low on the issue



21   of was there a motivation or a pressure to comply with



22   instructions from in this case the reigning judicial authority.



23            A fourth condition that has been referred to is that,



24   in my judgment, the materials are inadvertently or deliberately



25   designed to produce very high levels of confusability of the







                                                                 164



                           Reid Hastie - Direct



 1   defendants.  The defendants were identified by proper names,



 2   sometimes by the same proper name and sometimes by what were



 3   obviously nonsense fictional proper names, Abel, Baker, and



 4   Charlie.  It's actually a total coincidence in this case, but I



 5   would say I'm the national authority on the issue of what makes



 6   people individuate other people.



 7            I would say the lead article ever written in



 8   psychology -- this surprises me; it occurred to me today when



 9   we were sitting here -- is the 1974 paper with John Anderson in



10   which we compare the individuating facts of proper names versus



11   other kinds of descriptions.  And among other things we



12   discovered that if you included a photograph, even in an



13   artificial laboratory study, it multiplied the individuate --



14   individualization of the persons being judged.  These were not



15   legal judgments; these were other inferential judgments.



16            So what Bronson inadvertently did was produce the



17   worst conditions, given research that I've conducted on



18   independent individuation of persons to produce unconfusable or



19   individuated people.  And that was consistent in both of his



20   experimental studies.



21   Q.  Do you recall what the names were of the hypothetical



22   defendants in the Fresno study?



23   A.  Alvarez, Alvarez, and Ricardo, I believe.



24   Q.  Three Hispanics, two of which had the same last name?



25   A.  Yes.







                                                                 165



                           Reid Hastie - Direct



 1   Q.  And in the Butte study it was Abel, Baker, and Charlie?



 2   A.  Right.



 3   Q.  Was -- do you have any criticism in the manner in which the



 4   questions were posed to the subjects in Dr. Bronson's study?



 5   A.  Okay.  Well, this is really a two-part answer.  First of



 6   all, I would say it's a standard conclusion in survey



 7   methodology that when you want well motivated or complete or



 8   precise answers from subjects, whenever possible, you present



 9   them with alternatives.  We might call it a multiple choice



10   survey question and answer and ask them to choose among them.



11            But much of the -- I guess I would say all of the data



12   that Dr. Bronson used to draw conclusions about the lack of



13   attention to mitigating circumstances and so forth is taken



14   from responses to open-ended questions, which, in survey



15   approaches, are -- it's virtually an axiom of the field, a form



16   of question that will be likelier to elicit incomplete



17   responses.



18            So the first problem is -- and I could suggest



19   alternative forms of designing this questionnaire, but the



20   first problem is just the sole reliance on an open-ended



21   question to identify what factors subjects related to, to make



22   their judgments.



23            The second problem derives from the comparison between



24   joined and severed conditions, and it's already been



25   highlighted in the cross-exam.







                                                                 166



                           Reid Hastie - Direct



 1            We have subjects who are not very highly motivated, I



 2   would bet, to perform the task.  They're killing 15 minutes



 3   before class starts, or they're responding to a mail



 4   questionnaire, under what circumstances we don't know, talking



 5   to other people, watching television.  All of those are likely,



 6   I suspect, for some respondents.



 7            And we have one group of the subjects, the joined



 8   subjects, reading twice as much or one and a half to twice as



 9   much, very dense material, and then answering three times as



10   many open-ended questions, the questions that I've already said



11   are known to under-sample people's responses.



12            So what we have is a situation that's designed with



13   the combination of open-ended question and higher workload for



14   the joined subjects, is a situation where the joined subjects



15   are, under any principle of psychology or economics, going to



16   respond less fully and less completely.  They would have to



17   write three times as much, for example, to be as specific as



18   the severed respondents.



19            And I guess a lot of the responses in those conditions



20   that I believe Dr. Bronson interpreted as examples of confusion



21   or lack of individuation are very likely to result from



22   something else that's well known in survey research, and that's



23   known as the general sociolinguistic principle of responding



24   informatively and nonredundantly.  So, in fact, if a respondent



25   in the joined condition really did have similar reasons to







                                                                 167



                           Reid Hastie - Direct



 1   apply or choose a penalty for two of the subjects, it's very



 2   likely they would respond by leaving the second one blank or



 3   using ditto marks or some other telegraphic remark just because



 4   of -- you might call it norms of everyday communication.



 5   Q.  One of Dr. Bronson's conclusions in his affidavit was that



 6   jurors in joint proceedings tend to ignore or underweigh



 7   mitigating circumstances.  Do you have a judgment about his



 8   conclusion in that area?



 9   A.  Yes, I do.



10   Q.  What is that?



11   A.  I'm not persuaded that his conclusion is reliable or



12   general.



13   Q.  What is the foundation for your judgment?



14   A.  Well, I've actually just commented on some of the reasons:



15   The fact that the open-ended questions is -- especially when



16   the question has to be answered three times in the joined



17   condition, are -- you don't have to be a social scientist to



18   figure this out -- are biassed to produce incomplete answers,



19   answers that don't express all of the actual considerations



20   that were thought about when the decision was made.



21            Another comment is that the way that someone would



22   establish whether a factor like a mitigating factor that might



23   be mentioned in the penalty phase was relied on or not, the



24   convincing way to study whether that factor is relied on or not



25   relied on or has an effect, is to manipulate its presence.  And







                                                                 168



                           Reid Hastie - Direct



 1   in fact, many of the studies that Dr. Bronson cited in his



 2   affidavit and alluded to in court are studies of just that:



 3   The extent to which a mock juror relies on or does not rely on



 4   testimony that they're instructed not to attend to by a judge.



 5            And I'd say almost all of those experiments -- perhaps



 6   there is one exception -- included that manipulation in order



 7   to answer exactly that question:  Was the testimony that was



 8   stricken or limited actually ignored, or not?



 9            And the way to test that is to manipulate whether it's



10   present; and if it's present, you can compare it to the control



11   group where it wasn't present and see if it actually had an



12   effect.



13            In these studies, Dr. Bronson didn't try to study that



14   question; and I don't think his research gives an answer to the



15   question of whether the mitigating information is weighted more



16   heavily or less heavily in any particular groups of his



17   subjects.



18   Q.  Do you recall in Dr. Bronson's testimony that he draws the



19   conclusion that if the defendants are tried jointly, there is



20   more likelihood that they'll receive the death penalty?  And he



21   does that by multiplying the percentage of each individual



22   defendant by the percentage of the second defendant by the



23   percentage of the third defendant and reaches an overall



24   percentage of what one would expect if the three defendants



25   were tried separately, what the odds are that each of them







                                                                 169



                           Reid Hastie - Direct



 1   would get the death penalty?



 2   A.  Well, I need to clarify.  There is one effect in his



 3   results and that is in the joined condition, there is a higher



 4   probability for a subject in the joined condition to give the



 5   death penalty to one of the fictional defendants as compared to



 6   the severed condition.  That's one effect.



 7            The other effect that you're referring to, actually,



 8   involves comparing those effects; and it's the issue that was



 9   referred to in cross-examination when Mr. Connelly questioned



10   him about the hypothetical triplets; and that's the extent to



11   which the mock jurors' judgment will individuate the



12   defendants, the extent to which the judgments appear to be



13   dependent on one another, at least statistically.



14            I actually think that Dr. Bronson's results and



15   possibly -- although I really think we need a higher level



16   probability theorist.  I've had quite a few courses in



17   probability theory, and this is a very complex calculation that



18   he does.  It's deceptively simple, and I'm not sure I fully



19   understand it.



20            But I'll accept at least conditionally that it



21   actually makes the point that there is a dependency in



22   judgments.  What I think is puzzling about that is that there



23   are different kinds of dependencies; some dependencies that



24   would be legally illegitimate: for example, if the mock juror



25   said whenever the defendant is Hispanic, I'm going to give them







                                                                 170



                           Reid Hastie - Direct



 1   the death penalty, and in fact, I have three Hispanics here, so



 2   I'm going to go death penalty, death penalty, death penalty



 3   down the line because they're Hispanic.



 4            Or it would be illegitimate if the mock juror or the



 5   juror got confused about the defendants and remembered that all



 6   three of the defendants were sexually abused or were similar in



 7   age when they weren't.  So those would be illegitimate



 8   dependencies.



 9            But it seems to me there would be a lot of legitimate



10   dependencies, and that's what the triplets question, I think,



11   was designed to get at.  For example, I might believe that the



12   crime should be weighted not exclusively but more than the



13   mitigating circumstances.  And in Dr. Bronson's materials, the



14   criminal acts were virtually identical.  And so that would



15   produce a dependency, in my judgment, for these three



16   defendants; a reasonable, I think justifiable dependency.



17            Similarly, I might have a dependency that went the



18   other way.  I might have a very low personal appetite for the



19   death penalty.  I might not be a nullifier, but I might take a



20   very, very high level of conviction or threshold to produce the



21   death penalty.  And then for almost any triplet of



22   defendants -- certainly, for the defendants in these example



23   materials with the vast number of mitigating circumstances -- I



24   would come in with highly correlated or dependent judgments.



25            I can illustrate this point -- I'm probably going on







                                                                 171



                           Reid Hastie - Direct



 1   too long, but I think it's an interesting argument -- with



 2   another hypothetical.



 3            Suppose we ran Dr. Bronson's joined condition so that



 4   we have one mock juror making all three judgments, but we run



 5   it over a nine-year period; so in the first administration, our



 6   mock juror hears the information and judges the first



 7   defendant.  Then three years later, we go back and we have the



 8   same mock juror joined in this hypothetical make the second



 9   judgment.  And then three years later, we go back and get the



10   third judgment.  I would expect there is a correlation within a



11   juror of those judgments but not a silly or an illegitimate



12   correlation.  They would have a habit of weighting the factors



13   the same way that I would assume for this example would persist



14   over nine years; they would have a level or a threshold for



15   administering or saying yes to the death penalty and those



16   would be consistent, I'm assuming, for the example; and they



17   would produce interdependencies in the judgments.



18            And in my hypothetical, I think confusability is an



19   unlikely possibility with the three-year interval.  I think



20   some of the other carryover effects or contamination effects



21   lumping-together effects would be very unlikely with that



22   interval, but I think we'd still get correlations in the



23   judgment.



24            So I'm not quite sure why the finding of a correlation



25   is necessarily a devastating problem.  I'm sure I spent too







                                                                 172



                           Reid Hastie - Direct



 1   long on that example, but I've been struggling with the logic



 2   of it for a few hours.



 3   Q.  To what extent would you as a social scientist be willing



 4   to rely on Dr. Bronson's experimentations and his conclusions



 5   regarding the jointly tried capital defendants?



 6   A.  Well, I regret to say that I don't believe that these



 7   studies provide a substantial basis to draw any conclusions



 8   about what would happen if the McVeigh/Nichols defendants were



 9   joined or severed.



10   Q.  I'd like to ask you a few questions about the term



11   "external validity."  Would you explain to the Court what that



12   term means?



13   A.  It's another sort of background term in psychological



14   research, and Dr. Bronson uses it himself several places in the



15   affidavit.



16            It refers in my vocabulary to the -- if you have a



17   finding in one setting -- and let's take the experimental



18   setting -- so if we've got a conclusion that we believe is a



19   valid, correct conclusion about our experiment, to what other



20   situations can we generalize that conclusion?  To what external



21   situations does the result that we're sure is correct in our



22   original situation applicable?  And that's what external



23   validity refers to.



24   Q.  So even if we were willing for the sake of argument to



25   accept Dr. Bronson's conclusions were validly drawn based on







                                                                 173



                           Reid Hastie - Direct



 1   valid methodology and valid experiments, do you think that



 2   those studies would have any external validity to the facts of



 3   this case?



 4   A.  Emphasizing that it's hypothetical as to whether the



 5   original results are valid, reliable, I would say that the



 6   external validity with reference to the Nichols/McVeigh



 7   situation is extremely weak, perhaps -- well, extremely weak.



 8   Q.  Did you -- I think Dr. Bronson indicated that he had never



 9   attempted to publish any of his work except in this criminal



10   defense publication in California.



11            Based on your experience in serving on all of these



12   various editorial boards for the professional journals that you



13   testified to earlier, would a manuscript such as Dr. Bronson's



14   be publishable in a recognized peer review refereed



15   professional journal?



16   A.  If it was the same article or was an article based closely



17   on the affidavit, I would say the probability is extremely low



18   for any of the 50 or so journals that I've worked for or



19   reviewed for.



20   Q.  Why is that?



21   A.  Well --



22   Q.  I don't want you to repeat everything.  If it's a



23   repetition of what you've already told the Court, then just say



24   so; or if there are some additional reasons, please identify



25   them.







                                                                 174



                           Reid Hastie - Direct



 1   A.  It's essentially the reasons I've mentioned before with a



 2   further comment that the -- one of the critical editorial



 3   functions of these relatively conservative scientific journals



 4   is that they're, again, fairly conservative on what conclusions



 5   the author is allowed to draw beyond the data.  And so I'd add



 6   a little speech about how I believe Dr. Bronson has gone very



 7   far beyond what his data implies in the conclusions in the



 8   paper.  So both with reference to the quality of the research



 9   and the logic with which he's drawn conclusions, I think the



10   paper would have a great deal of trouble.



11   Q.  We've talked about Dr. Bronson's studies and the fact that



12   you believe those are an insubstantial basis to draw



13   conclusions.  I'd now like to turn to the more general subject



14   of behavioral science literature and ask you if there is any



15   behavioral science literature that impacts on this question of



16   joinder.



17   A.  Well, Dr. Bronson is absolutely correct that at least he



18   and I don't know of any studies aside from his that look at the



19   specific mechanism or issue of joinder or severance of



20   defendants at trial in the empirical social science literature.



21            There are related literatures, and Dr. Bronson and the



22   defense attorneys in their brief have cited them.  The closest



23   literatures, I would say, are literatures of research about



24   joinder of charges for a single defendant and then literature



25   on the effects on a juror of making repeated judgments in







                                                                 175



                           Reid Hastie - Direct



 1   completely separate trials of different trials with different



 2   charges.  And then there is the literature that is also, I'd



 3   say, relevant on mock jurors and jurors' willingness and



 4   capacity to comply with instructions to limit the use of



 5   evidence or to disregard evidence.



 6   Q.  Without asking you to review all of that literature, let me



 7   ask a general question:  Is it possible to draw conclusions



 8   from this body of behavioral literature as to what impact



 9   joinder will have on capital sentencing and the jury's ability



10   to give individualized consideration to each defendant?



11   A.  I have to say that the literature yields a lot of



12   conflicting implications.  My reading of it is extremely



13   different than the summary in the defense briefs; that, for



14   example, the literature is unanimous in finding jurors'



15   capacity in regard to following instructions to disregard



16   evidence -- is severely limited.



17            My reading of the literature -- and it included quite



18   a different collection of citations, but it also included some



19   that the defense cited -- found a much more mixed picture, not



20   a unanimous picture at all.



21            In almost half of the studies on the issue of capacity



22   to comply with the instruction to disregard or limit from the



23   same journals as the other studies, the result was that,



24   apparently, the mock jurors could comply.



25            My own research -- and I guess it's one reason I stay







                                                                 176



                           Reid Hastie - Direct



 1   in the business that I'm in -- has found that jurors and juries



 2   are conscientious and, if anything, lenient in their decisions



 3   with regard to defendants.



 4            I also think that in these situations, the possibility



 5   of confusion or failure to independently individuate in a



 6   realistic trial or in the trial that's going to occur here is



 7   of extremely low magnitude and, in my view, almost



 8   discountable.



 9            So speaking very generally, I think there are



10   tentative conclusions from a thorough balanced review of the



11   literature; and my tentative -- well, I have a tentative



12   conclusion.



13   Q.  What is your tentative conclusion?



14   A.  It's -- I guess my best judgment is that the issues of



15   independent individuation, confusion and failure to comply with



16   the judge's instructions at both the guilt and the penalty



17   phase with reference to limiting use of the testimony that I've



18   been told is or has been foregrounded in the briefs and the



19   issues that are -- could possibly arrive at the penalty phase



20   when the defendants need to be independently individuated are



21   not a major threat in this trial.



22            MR. RYAN:  That's all I have, your Honor.  I'll pass



23   the witness.



24            MR. TIGAR:  I don't need a recess, your Honor, unless



25   you plan to take it at this time.







                                                                 177



                           Reid Hastie - Direct



 1            THE COURT:  No.  Let's go ahead.



 2                          CROSS-EXAMINATION



 3   BY MR. TIGAR:



 4   Q.  Dr. Hastie, you were retained when, sir?



 5   A.  I believe it was Wednesday, last week.



 6   Q.  Do you know how long the motions for severance have been on



 7   file?



 8   A.  I didn't notice.  I have the cover sheets.  The earliest



 9   date might be 9-4-96.  Is that correct?



10   Q.  Whatever it shows.  You were not asked to do any study,



11   were you, of the risk of juror confusion in this case?



12   A.  No empirical studies, no.



13   Q.  Did you read the federal death penalty sentencing statute?



14   A.  No, I have not.



15   Q.  Are you aware that individual jurors in federal death



16   penalty cases may decide each for themselves what is or is not



17   a mitigating factor?



18   A.  No.



19   Q.  Do you know what the role of federal jurors is in weighing



20   aggravating versus mitigating factors?



21   A.  Not specifically, no.



22   Q.  Have you ever consulted in a case involving jury sentencing



23   in which jurors were to apply a weighing-type statute at the



24   penalty phase?



25   A.  I was involved in the hearings that followed Grigsby and







                                                                 178



                           Reid Hastie - Cross



 1   then Lockhart and McCree, I guess it became; and I believe



 2   those were issues there, although I did not review literature



 3   or testify on that decision.



 4   Q.  Let's talk about Lockhart vs. McCree.  You were a witness,



 5   were you not, sir?



 6   A.  Yes.



 7   Q.  I ask you to imagine that there are 100 jurors summoned to



 8   try a case.  I ask you to imagine that 50 of them are death



 9   qualified and 50 of them are not death qualified; and yet in



10   all other respects, they say that they are able to follow the



11   court's instructions and thus they are not subject to any



12   challenge for cause.



13            Do we have the facts?



14   A.  Yes.



15   Q.  Do you expect a difference in the decisional processes



16   employed or the results you would expect from the first group



17   of 50 as opposed to the second group of 50?



18            MR. RYAN:  Your Honor, I object.  That's a question



19   that goes to the death qualification of jurors.  That question



20   has been answered by the United States Supreme Court and is not



21   an issue in this severance hearing.



22            THE COURT:  Overruled.



23   BY MR. TIGAR:



24   Q.  Sir . . .



25   A.  Nothing that I know about tells me that the general process







                                                                 179



                           Reid Hastie - Cross



 1   by which the death qualified and eliminated jurors, the



 2   excluded jurors, would be any different.



 3   Q.  Conclusion in Lockhart about the jurors -- the death



 4   qualified jurors?



 5   A.  That the outcome of their decision processes would be



 6   different and that juries would be less representative; that



 7   the two groups were different in significant cognizable



 8   fashions from one another.



 9   Q.  Now, I don't want to ask about the Lockhart question.  You



10   said that you concluded the outcome would be different; right?



11   A.  Right.



12   Q.  Now, I have asked you to assume that these are jurors, all



13   of whom, each group of 50, swear that they are willing to



14   follow the court's instructions; and yet you say outcomes,



15   you'd expect to be different.  Right?



16   A.  Yes.  The verdicts.



17   Q.  The verdicts.  Now, in your testimony on direct



18   examination, you talked about one of the alleged flaws of the



19   Bronson study being that the -- had three people are joined and



20   the respondents were asked to judge three people seriatim, 1,



21   2, and 3, that there was a risk of what, the ditto effect,



22   would you call it?



23   A.  What I was referring to was the manner in which they would



24   report the reasons for their decision.



25   Q.  All right.







                                                                 180



                           Reid Hastie - Cross



 1   A.  I didn't -- I'm sure I didn't say that their decision was a



 2   ditto or a Xerox of another decision but that when they were



 3   asked open-ended questions about the reasons for their



 4   decisions, they would be likely and especially likely if they



 5   had to make the judgment repeatedly, to report to Bronson that



 6   they did it -- that the same reason applied.



 7   Q.  And one reason for that is that they are relatively



 8   unsupervised; right?



 9   A.  That's right.



10   Q.  Now, you know that jurors deliberate in a room without



11   supervision; correct?



12   A.  Uh-huh.  That's right.



13   Q.  Indeed, that's one of the troubles with jury research, is



14   that you can't go in there and be with them while they're



15   talking to each other; correct?



16   A.  Problems, I don't know.  It's a fact.



17   Q.  Well, you know Harry Kalven and Hans Zeisel's book, The 



18   American Jury, don't you?



19   A.  Yes.



20   Q.  And you recall in the early stages of that research that



21   there was great scandal because they started to put some



22   microphones in some jury rooms that was found out about and



23   they couldn't do it anymore?



24   A.  Right.



25   Q.  So you're aware of the difficulties they recount in chapter







                                                                 181



                           Reid Hastie - Cross



 1   1 of that book; correct?



 2   A.  Correct.



 3   Q.  Now, in a long capital trial, how long would you expect a



 4   penalty phase to take?  Could it take three or four weeks?



 5   A.  Boy, I'm not the person to tell you about how long it will



 6   take in various kinds of capital trials.



 7   Q.  Could -- well, could you imagine it taking three or four



 8   weeks?



 9   A.  Yes.



10   Q.  Now, when it's all done and during those three or four



11   weeks, thousands of words are spoken; correct?



12   A.  Yes.



13   Q.  At the end of it, the judge gives some instructions;



14   correct?



15   A.  Yes.



16   Q.  Isn't the fact, sir, that the ratio of the judge's



17   instructions to the words the jurors have heard is about the



18   same as the 150 to 4,000 ratio in the Bronson study?



19   A.  Yes, that's quite plausible.



20   Q.  And isn't it also the case as we've just found out that



21   jurors do go in and deliberate often for days at a time without



22   judicial interference or interruption; correct?



23   A.  Yes, that's correct.



24   Q.  Now, is it reasonable, therefore, without doing any



25   research -- is it reasonable to think that jurors having gone







                                                                 182



                           Reid Hastie - Cross



 1   through an arduous process of listening to testimony about two



 2   individual lives that are very different would -- having gone



 3   through the decisional process of deciding that one person is



 4   to live or die would be tired or exhausted by the deliberative



 5   process that led to their decision that one of the two people



 6   they're supposed to talk about was to live or die?  Wouldn't



 7   you expect that?



 8   A.  I'm sure they'll be tired.



 9   Q.  And would you therefore expect that after they're tired,



10   after having heard these four weeks and then the judge's



11   additional instructions and being in a room without any



12   supervision that the second person whose life they are to hold



13   in their hands to decide whether he is going to live or die



14   would get somewhat less consideration in some way than the



15   first person as to whom they had made a decision?



16   A.  I honestly am not sure which way it would go.



17   Q.  Well, if you're not sure which way it would go and if the



18   lives of these people were in your keeping, what would you



19   counsel a wise person to do: to try them separately or try them



20   together and take the risk of the unknown?  What would you



21   counsel him?



22   A.  With no reason to believe it would go one way or the



23   other --



24   Q.  Yes, sir.



25   A.  -- and a firm belief that the jurors are conscientious and







                                                                 183



                           Reid Hastie - Cross



 1   in a situation that demands their attention by orders of



 2   magnitude more than the subjects' attention was demanded in



 3   Mr. Bronson's studies, I really don't have a strong opinion



 4   about whether it would be good or bad, more just, less just,



 5   more accurate, less accurate, to join them or sever them.



 6   Q.  Let me ask you, then, sir, about some of the research that



 7   you have done about juror attitudes.  You know Dr. Loftus,



 8   don't you?



 9   A.  Yes.



10   Q.  Elizabeth Loftus?



11   A.  Yes.



12   Q.  In fact, you authored an article with her in 1978; correct?



13   A.  Yes.



14   Q.  That's at the top of page 3.



15            Now, you're aware, sir, that sometimes we exclude from



16   jury consideration eyewitness identifications by people that



17   are willing to point to the defendant in court and say he's the



18   one; correct?



19   A.  Yes, that's correct.



20   Q.  And we do that sometimes because the person has made a



21   prior identification under unreliable circumstances; correct?



22   A.  Yes, that's right.



23   Q.  And in those cases, we don't have faith, do we, in the



24   judge's instructions to a jury to consider all of the factors



25   of the earlier identification and to make up their mind?  We







                                                                 184



                           Reid Hastie - Cross



 1   just decide as a matter that we're not going to even let the



 2   jurors hear about it.  Right?  That's what happens; right?



 3   A.  Yes, that's right.



 4   Q.  And as a social scientist, you think that's good, don't



 5   you?  That's the right thing for judges to do?



 6   A.  Boy, I don't think there is a simple answer in the general.



 7   If you want my opinion about whether it would improve the



 8   jurors' performance as a fact-finder in a specific case -- I'm



 9   really not being evasive.  I need to see the circumstances of



10   that case.



11   Q.  Well, let me just ask you this, because it's only related



12   to this "jurors' following instructions" question.  You



13   concluded in your article, didn't you, that initial questioning



14   can so taint an eyewitness identification as to make it



15   unreliable; correct?



16   A.  Yes, I did.



17   Q.  Now, in addition to that, sir, you're aware that sometimes



18   judges change venue in cases; correct?



19   A.  Yes.



20   Q.  And that has to do with a lack of confidence, doesn't it,



21   at least in part, that jurors can be trusted when they say I



22   can put out of my mind what I've read in the media; correct?



23   A.  Yes, that's right.



24   Q.  You've also in the literature talked about something called



25   "The Story."  Is that right?







                                                                 185



                           Reid Hastie - Cross



 1   A.  Yes.  That's right.



 2   Q.  Well, what do you mean by "The Story"?



 3   A.  I'll try to keep it really brief.



 4   Q.  Yeah.



 5   A.  My general theory about the typical juror's decision



 6   process is that he or she spends most of the time during the



 7   guilt judgment phase -- and if I had thought about it harder,



 8   probably during the penalty phase, but the phase I've studied



 9   is the guilt phase -- trying to construct a story that they



10   believe that summarizes the facts that they think are credible



11   and that is internally coherent.  And once they've constructed



12   that story, they use it to make further inferences; for



13   example, whether the defendant is guilty of a crime that the



14   judge describes to them.



15   Q.  And that -- that notion of "The Story "-- that's -- that's



16   a theory of human cognition, isn't it?



17   A.  Perhaps that general; but in this example, it's a theory of



18   how the typical juror makes a decision in a civil or a criminal



19   case.



20   Q.  And do you attribute that theory that you've told us about,



21   "The Story," in part to the gestalt theories?



22   A.  Well, no, but that's beside the point.  It's a kind of



23   gestalt theory, but it doesn't derive in any simple way from



24   the historical tradition of gestalt psychology.  But I don't



25   think --







                                                                 186



                           Reid Hastie - Cross



 1   Q.  Doctor, I'm not going to try to follow you down that road



 2   even if you wanted to go there.



 3            Let's come back to the story.  When jurors read about



 4   aggravated crime that's had a lot of publicity, they're likely



 5   to come to court with a story partly formed, aren't they?



 6   A.  Yes.  That's one possible effect of pretrial publicity, for



 7   example.



 8   Q.  And there sure has been pretrial publicity in this case,



 9   hasn't there, sir?



10   A.  Yes.



11   Q.  In fact, before you ever heard about you were going to be a



12   witness in this case, you had some views about it, didn't you?



13   A.  Well, I'm virtually out of contact with any media.  I've



14   never seen a report of this case on television.  In fact, I've



15   never read a newspaper article about the case.



16   Q.  Then you're an exception.  I'll go on to something else.



17   A.  I'm unusual.



18   Q.  So our average juror who has read a lot comes with a kind



19   of a story?



20   A.  Yes.



21   Q.  Now, in the guilt phase of a trial, jurors are trying to



22   make sense of an event that happened in the historic past; is



23   that correct?



24   A.  That's the way I describe it.



25   Q.  And if the alleged participation of two people in the







                                                                 187



                           Reid Hastie - Cross



 1   historic past is very, very different, jurors can have trouble



 2   keeping it all as a part of one story; correct?



 3   A.  Yes, indeed.



 4   Q.  Now, now we move into a penalty phase.  At the penalty



 5   phase, isn't it the case, sir, that where the jury has



 6   sentencing power under a weighing statute, that it is



 7   absolutely essential for there to be two stories?



 8   A.  Yes.



 9   Q.  Now, it wouldn't be so difficult if there were two stories



10   if the judge were doing the sentencing, would it?



11   A.  Well, I don't know about that.



12   Q.  Okay.  Well, then I'll leave that one alone because we're



13   just dealing with jurors here.



14            Now, I suppose that I could ask you, since you've



15   wanted to -- you told us about Dr. Bronson's bias:  Do you have



16   a bias that you come to with respect to the death penalty?



17   A.  You mean my attitude pro or con?



18   Q.  Yes, sir.  You don't have to tell us if you don't want to,



19   but if you think it's relevant in the same way you thought



20   Dr. Bronson's view was relevant, then please share it with us,



21   so we'll know.



22   A.  Well, I haven't worried -- I have worried about my



23   attitudes coloring my evaluation of, for example, Dr. Bronson's



24   work or the literature in this -- with reference to this



25   testimony.  And I just don't see an influence from my attitudes







                                                                 188



                           Reid Hastie - Cross



 1   about the death penalty.



 2            I am not strongly opposed to the death penalty.  If I



 3   were allowed to vote to rescind it, I would.



 4            I think it's uncivilized and that it has some very bad



 5   by-products, but I also see some positive factors to it; so I'm



 6   not strongly opposed to it.  I could serve on a death-qualified



 7   jury.



 8   Q.  And if you were serving on a death-qualified jury with all



 9   of your training in human cognition, you would want to make



10   very sure that you were able to hear each nuance, each aspect



11   of the story of each defendant whose life would be in your



12   hands.  Isn't that right?



13   A.  Yes.



14            MR. TIGAR:  I have nothing further.



15            MR. RYAN:  One question.



16            THE COURT:  All right, Mr. Ryan.



17            MR. RYAN:  It will take me longer to get to the podium



18   than the question will take.



19            THE COURT:  Well, you can ask it from there, if you



20   want.



21                        REDIRECT EXAMINATION



22   BY MR. RYAN:



23   Q.  Mr. Tigar asked you about your writings and theorization



24   with respect to "The Story" theory.  Based on your knowledge of



25   this case from the reading of the severance papers, do you have







                                                                 189



                          Reid Hastie - Redirect



 1   an opinion as to whether or not in a joint trial a jury, a



 2   single jury, can give individualized consideration to



 3   Mr. Nichols and to Mr. McVeigh?



 4   A.  Yes, I do.



 5            MR. RYAN:  No further questions.



 6            MR. TIGAR:  I'm sorry.  I didn't hear the answer, your



 7   Honor.



 8            THE COURT:  Yes, I do.



 9            THE WITNESS:  Yes, I do; and I think that it can.



10            THE COURT:  Well, you weren't asked beyond "Yes, I



11   do."



12            MR. TIGAR:  Nothing further, your Honor.



13            THE COURT:  All right.  Witness excused?



14            MR. RYAN:  Yes, your Honor.



15            THE COURT:  You may step down.  You're excused.



16            We can take the recess now.  We'll take 20 minutes.



17       (Recess at 3:05 p.m.)



18       (Reconvened at 3:24 p.m.)



19            THE COURT:  Please be seated.  Mr. Ryan, your next



20   witness?



21            MR. RYAN:  Your Honor, before I call our next witness,



22   I felt that I had asked Dr. Hastie the question of whether or



23   not he, in fact, had an opinion with respect to the jury's



24   ability to give individualized attention.  He said he had an



25   opinion, and he later told the Court that he felt it could







                                                                 190







 1   receive individualized attention under the facts of this case.



 2   I don't know -- I don't think I know -- in fact, I know the



 3   question was not directly put to him as your Honor pointed out.



 4   I've asked Mr. Tigar to let the record reflect that is, in



 5   fact, his opinion.  Mr. Tigar has graciously agreed, so I would



 6   like the Court to take note of that.



 7            MR. TIGAR:  Yes, your Honor, we've agreed the answer



 8   can stand as he gave it the second time.



 9            THE COURT:  Okay.



10            MR. RYAN:  The Government's next witness, your Honor,



11   is Andrew Coat.



12            THE COURT:  Please come forward to be sworn.



13       (Andrew Coat was sworn by affirmation.)



14            COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Please be seated.  Please state



15   your full name for the record and spell your last name.

19   Q.  Mr. Coat, what is your occupation?



20   A.  I'm an attorney.



21   Q.  Your present employment?



22   A.  I'm currently the dean of the law school at the University



23   of Oklahoma.



24   Q.  Mr. Coat, I would like to -- I've given the Court as



25   Exhibit 13 -- which we would move its admission -- a copy of







                                                                 191

 2            MR. RYAN:  May I inquire if there's any objection?



 3            MR. TIGAR:  No objection, your Honor.



 4            THE COURT:  All right.  13 is received.



 5   BY MR. RYAN:



 6   Q.  I would like to go over very quickly if I might -- could



 7   you briefly outline for his Honor your education.



 8   A.  I graduated from the University of Oklahoma in history and



 9   government in 1957.  I spent three years as an officer in the



10   United States Navy, returned to the law school in 1960, and



11   graduated in 1963 from the University of Oklahoma College of



12   Law.



13   Q.  In terms of honors, you were Phi Beta Kappa?



14   A.  I was.



15   Q.  You were also selected as the outstanding law graduate of



16   the University of Oklahoma?



17   A.  That is so.



18   Q.  After graduating from law school, where did you go to work?



19   A.  I began practice with the firm of Crowe & Dunlevy in



20   Oklahoma City, limiting my practice really to litigation



21   primarily, some appellate work.



22   Q.  Now, you and I have a common affiliation with Crowe &



23   Dunlevy, do we not?



24   A.  Well, we were both there.  We were law partners over the



25   years -- for a number of years at different times.







                                                                 192



                           Andrew Coat - Direct



 1   Q.  We tried to be law partners?



 2   A.  Well, that's true.  It was kind of touch and go.  For the



 3   record, I guess Mr. Ryan came to the firm when I was a partner



 4   and he was an associate.  He was there for a little time, and



 5   then I left to become a district attorney of Oklahoma County.



 6   When I came back, Pat left.  In more recent times, there was



 7   talk of him coming back to the firm, and so I left.



 8   Q.  I've given that more thought every day.



 9            Could you advise his Honor with respect to your



10   activities with respect to the bar associations and



11   professional organizations.



12   A.  Well, I have been somewhat active in the bar association



13   over the years.  I served as the president of the Young Lawyers



14   Conference, and I served as president of the Oklahoma County



15   Bar Association and then some years ago was president of the



16   Oklahoma State Bar Association.



17   Q.  Do you remember -- are you a fellow in the American College



18   of Trial Lawyers?



19   A.  I am a fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers, and



20   I'm currently the president elect of the college.



21   Q.  Of the national college?



22   A.  Yes.



23   Q.  How long did you serve as district attorney in Oklahoma



24   County?



25   A.  Four years, from 19 -- June of 1976 to June of 1980.







                                                                 193



                           Andrew Coat - Direct



 1   Q.  You've also been mayor of Oklahoma City?



 2   A.  I did.  Served as mayor of Oklahoma City from 1983 to 1987.



 3   Q.  And you have returned -- following your stint in politics,



 4   you returned to Crowe & Dunlevy in 1980?



 5   A.  I did.  Came back in '80 and been there until the early



 6   part of this year.



 7   Q.  With respect -- are you affiliated in any way with respect



 8   to the International Academy of Trial Lawyers?



 9   A.  Yes.  I'm a fellow of the International Academy and also



10   the American Board of Trial Advocates.



11   Q.  In fact, you were the charter president of that



12   organization in Oklahoma, were you not?



13   A.  I was.



14   Q.  You've been an active trial lawyer for the past 33 years?



15   A.  That is so.



16   Q.  And could you tell his Honor approximately how many jury



17   trials you have tried.



18   A.  I have never really made a count.  I've never really made a



19   count, but I would guess it to be somewhere in the 300 range of



20   jury cases and probably another 100 or so of trials to the



21   bench.



22   Q.  And what percentage of these cases involved multiple



23   plaintiffs or defendants?



24   A.  Well, quite a number of them.  I would guess in some form



25   or another, half of them involved multiple defendants or







                                                                 194



                           Andrew Coat - Direct



 1   sometimes multiple plaintiffs, depending on which side.  I did



 2   work on both sides.  I both did civil and defense -- and I did



 3   defense work and plaintiff's work on the civil side of the



 4   docket, and I did both prosecution for four years and then



 5   quite a bit of defense, criminal defense work at other times.



 6   Q.  Approximately how many criminal cases have you tried for



 7   the prosecution?



 8   A.  Oh, total, I would guess somewhere in the range of 10 or 12



 9   a year for the years that I was district attorney.



10   Q.  I'm sorry.  What did you say?



11   A.  10 to 12 a year for the four years I was district attorney.



12   It would be around 50, I would suppose.



13   Q.  Approximately how many criminal cases have you tried for



14   the defense?



15   A.  Oh, probably an equal number over the years, something like



16   that.



17   Q.  With the percentages that you gave us a moment ago --



18   approximately half the cases you've tried involved multiple



19   parties -- would that also be true of the criminal cases in



20   which you were involved?



21   A.  Yes.  Probably not -- not quite as large a percentage



22   there.  Probably 40 percent or 30 percent of the -- of the



23   criminal cases were joint defendants or we were prosecuting



24   defendants jointly.  Probably a somewhat larger percentage were



25   individuals, but there were certainly a large representation of







                                                                 195



                           Andrew Coat - Direct



 1   joint defendant cases.



 2   Q.  How many capital cases have you tried, Mr. Coat?



 3   A.  I -- I would estimate about 14, perhaps.  Something like



 4   that.



 5   Q.  And how many of those cases that you and your office tried



 6   were capital cases?



 7   A.  Well, those were capital cases.



 8   Q.  I'm -- excuse me.  I didn't mean capital cases.  I mean



 9   joint capital cases.



10   A.  I think there were only three of those that were joint --



11   joint cases.



12   Q.  And what -- do you recall the results of those?



13   A.  I think in one case, there was a double death sentence, I



14   think in one case there was a double life sentence, and I think



15   in one there was a life sentence and a lesser-included offense.



16   Sort of a mixed bag.



17   Q.  Following the 14 capital trials that -- that you have



18   conducted, have you had an opportunity and, in fact,



19   interviewed the jurors in these capital cases?



20   A.  We did.  I did in almost every case.  We were permitted to



21   under our practice there in state court in Oklahoma.  I did it.



22   Not only in those cases but in most cases we tried, we were



23   able to visit with and talk to jurors.  Not every juror,



24   obviously, but some jurors and usually several jurors from each



25   case to get their feelings about the presentation, about things







                                                                 196



                           Andrew Coat - Direct



 1   that they under -- sort of gain their -- my understanding of



 2   their understanding of the various aspects of the case and



 3   to -- we did it for the purpose of improving our skills as



 4   prosecutors and try and be sure that our -- the prosecutors



 5   that worked for me that were -- were doing the best job they



 6   could.



 7   Q.  And did you do that in the single defendant case -- capital



 8   cases as well as the three capital -- joint capital cases



 9   you've spoken of?



10   A.  Yes.



11   Q.  Can you draw any conclusions with respect to following your



12   interviews with these capital jurors as to their ability to



13   recall details of the case or to separate the facts with



14   respect to various defendants?



15   A.  I was always very favorably impressed with the intensity



16   with which the juries concentrated on the various aspects of



17   our cases and their ability to recall sometimes even two and



18   three weeks later the facts and circumstances that were -- that



19   came through the evidence that was presented to them from



20   the -- from the witness chairs.  I thought they had good



21   ability to recall it, and obviously, they -- they cared very



22   much about trying to reach the right result.  And consequently,



23   they really did listen and pay attention and try to remember



24   and -- and try to reach the right result.



25   Q.  Did they frequently express to you the importance of the







                                                                 197



                           Andrew Coat - Direct



 1   decision that they had undertaken regarding deciding whether or



 2   not a capital defendant should live or die?



 3   A.  Yes.  In my view, the -- the obvious most difficult



 4   decision any juror is called upon to make is the death penalty



 5   decision.  And you could tell that they truly in many cases



 6   agonized over that decision.  And that if there was a good --



 7   good reason -- they could find some good reason not to -- to



 8   invoke the death penalty, quite often, they did not or at least



 9   some of them did not.  And that was tantamount to the whole



10   jury not invoking the death penalty.



11            They really, again -- I feel like jurors in all cases



12   really try to do the right thing, but obviously that is



13   heightened to some degree in death penalty cases.  They live



14   and die with their verdict and they live and die with the



15   testimony that is there and they carry it with them even years



16   afterwards.



17   Q.  Did you get calls at night from capital defendants --



18   excuse me -- capital jurors?



19   A.  Yeah.  Not, obviously, during the trial, but sometimes



20   later, people would call me up and -- and ask to talk about,



21   you know -- mostly they want me to hear them.  It wasn't they



22   were really trying to get anything from me as much as -- they



23   were retrying the case in their mind and they were -- they were



24   wanting to discuss it with -- something that was still living



25   with them.







                                                                 198



                           Andrew Coat - Direct



 1   Q.  Following the -- their decision, did they come to your



 2   office?



 3   A.  Most -- occasionally, although mostly it would be the



 4   hallway.  Our jurors were there for, like, three weeks for a



 5   jury term.  And so if they tried the case in the first few days



 6   of the term, quite often, they would stop me in the hall later



 7   and -- and/or visit with me about the case and talk about it.



 8   And again, mostly, it was a matter of their telling me, you



 9   know, what they remembered about it and what was important to



10   them and that -- that sort of thing.



11   Q.  Did you hear the testimony of Dr. Bronson?



12   A.  Yes.  I did.



13   Q.  Did you hear him describe the 15 minutes in which students



14   and other citizens filled out a -- read a questionnaire and



15   filled it out with respect to whether they would give the death



16   penalty?



17   A.  Yes, I heard that.



18   Q.  How do you think -- how realistic do you think that type of



19   experiment is when compared to real-life capital cases?



20   A.  Well, of course, I just heard about it for the first time



21   today, but it did occur to me that the thing that I found from



22   jurors, that in talking, and the thing that seemed to me



23   obvious was that when they sit in a courtroom for three or four



24   weeks or five weeks and they look at the defendants, they



25   really become people to them.







                                                                 199



                           Andrew Coat - Direct



 1            And it seemed to me that the flaw in that study was



 2   that it does disregard to some degree the -- the human elements



 3   of the people identifying with and seeing a person there that



 4   they are trying for a heinous crime and they -- they are there



 5   with them and they see them walk and talk and laugh and they



 6   become a real person.  And I think that -- I think it's a good



 7   thing about the system because it makes it that much more



 8   difficult to assess the death penalty.



 9            But I think it seems to me that reading some papers



10   off a script somewhere and -- and trying to compare that to the



11   process of sitting there, hearing able counsel extol the



12   virtues or talk about the mitigation of a person and seeing



13   that person in their real persona and -- and being exposed to



14   them for a long period of time is such a substantially



15   different thing that I don't know how you could credit the



16   other very much.



17   Q.  Are you familiar with Stephen Jones?



18   A.  Yes, sir.



19   Q.  And again, this line of questioning will cause me great



20   pain, but I'll do it nonetheless.  Would you regard Mr. Jones



21   as a very competent trial counsel?



22   A.  I do indeed.  I had the privilege of trying a case against



23   Mr. Jones some years ago, and we handled two or three other



24   things together.  And that was a -- quite a number of years



25   ago.  He just continued to grow in stature.  I think he is







                                                                 200



                           Andrew Coat - Direct



 1   clearly one of the finest, if not the finest criminal defense



 2   lawyer in Oklahoma, certainly a gifted advocate, able lawyer,



 3   and certainly one who will do a great job in defending any



 4   client that he undertakes to represent.



 5   Q.  Do you know Mr. Tigar?



 6   A.  I do.  By reputation mostly.  And -- although I have been



 7   in situations -- a litigation situation which he was involved



 8   some years ago, I -- I argued a case in the Tenth Circuit right



 9   behind him arising out of a similar fact situation in Oklahoma



10   City.  And again, he is nationally known as an extremely able



11   and -- and brilliant trial lawyer and, again, a gifted advocate



12   and, certainly, one who would be a formidable opponent.  I



13   don't think that Judge Russell, if he made the appointments,



14   did the Government any favor by selection of counsel in this



15   case.



16   Q.  Do you have an opinion as to whether Mr. Jones and



17   Mr. Tigar are capable of differentiating the proof for the



18   benefit of the jury against their client from the proof against



19   the other in a joint trial?



20   A.  I wish all the questions I had to answer were as easy as



21   that one.  I have no question at all that those gentlemen will



22   clearly differentiate themselves and their clients from each



23   other in the minds of the jurors, the spectators, the judge, or



24   anybody else that's in the vicinity; that they will indeed do a



25   remarkable job of representing their clients as I think all







                                                                 201



                           Andrew Coat - Direct



 1   people can already see through the early stages of this trial.



 2   And I don't think there will be any question there will be any



 3   confusion in anybody's mind about the clients or the lawyers in



 4   this case.



 5   Q.  Did you -- have you also interviewed noncapital juries with



 6   respect to their ability in joint cases, joint trials, to



 7   differentiate the evidence as to each defendant?



 8   A.  Yes, I think "interview" is probably too strong a word.  I



 9   have talked with them, and, of course, I have seen their



10   reactions and been in so many of those cases.  And juries



11   invariably, I think, judge each person on their own merits and



12   clearly differentiate between defendants and the people accused



13   of crimes.  They quite often convict some defendants and turn



14   some away, acquit some.  They -- they quite often have various



15   judgments in terms of severity of the punishment as between



16   defendants in the same case.  I -- it just goes on all the



17   time.  I've never seen situations where I felt the juries did



18   not make a differentiation, if one was properly deserved, as



19   between joint defendants.



20   Q.  In this case, as you're aware, an argument is being made by



21   the defense that in a joint trial where there is a capital



22   sentencing hearing, there's a greater chance of a death



23   sentence than if the trial were severed and the defendants were



24   tried separately.  Do you agree with that hypothesis?



25   A.  No, I don't.  I think that the -- the jury in this case







                                                                 202



                           Andrew Coat - Direct



 1   could very -- and would weigh each of the people involved here



 2   on their own circumstances based on the evidence they hear.  I



 3   think they would be -- would listen carefully to counsel and to



 4   the witnesses if they choose to testify, and I think they can



 5   make individual distinctions and determinations.  I don't know



 6   of any reason to believe that they are more apt to give both



 7   the death penalty or one the death penalty or both life than



 8   they would be if they were tried separately.



 9   Q.  Prior to your coming to court today, did you ask to look at



10   some information with respect to capital sentencing in



11   federal -- in the capital federal cases?



12   A.  Yes, I did.



13   Q.  Did you also ask to look at some information that the



14   attorney general from Oklahoma could provide with respect to



15   joint capital trials?



16   A.  Yes.  In both cases, I was curious to see if there was any



17   pattern, and so I asked your office to file -- look at the



18   joint -- joint tried capital cases in federal courts and the



19   joint tried capital cases in Oklahoma, which is where I know



20   something about jurors.  And that information was provided to



21   me.



22   Q.  And were the results -- after looking at that data, federal



23   data and the Oklahoma data, did you draw any conclusions with



24   respect to whether, in fact, there was a pattern?



25            MR. TIGAR:  Excuse me, your Honor.  I object to the







                                                                 203



                           Andrew Coat - Direct



 1   witness opining about a study which -- in which he didn't



 2   participate, didn't have anything to do with.  All he did was



 3   read it, and he's going to tell us about it.



 4            THE COURT:  I didn't understand it to be based on a



 5   study but simply reported data.  Is that right?



 6            MR. RYAN:  That's right.



 7            THE COURT:  Do you have --



 8            MR. RYAN:  It's just simply the cap -- results of



 9   capital cases in federal court and Oklahoma.  Do they show --



10            THE COURT:  Well, you said both federal and state, I



11   thought.



12            MR. RYAN:  Federal and Oklahoma, your Honor.



13            THE COURT:  Oh, all right.



14   BY MR. RYAN:



15   Q.  And did you see any pattern with respect to whether the



16   defendants -- it was a march to death, if you will, as the



17   defense has insisted upon in this case?



18   A.  No.  From the information furnished to me, I could not



19   discern any pattern.  There were a number of cases jointly



20   tried.  In those cases, there would be some in which both the



21   defendants got -- or two defendants, they both got death.



22   There were some in which both got life.  There were quite a



23   number in which some got the death penalty and some -- and some



24   joint defendants did not and in some, when we get life and



25   something even less than that.







                                                                 204



                           Andrew Coat - Direct



 1            Both of the federal cases that I saw, I -- my



 2   recollection is that there were, like, 15 and there were six



 3   death penalties and nine not death penalties of jointly



 4   acquired -- jointly tried defendants.  And in Oklahoma, some



 5   such to the same numbers.  And there was no pattern that I



 6   could see one way or the other.  It seemed to me it was pretty



 7   clear that jurors decided the issues based on the evidence of



 8   the case and the -- and the circumstances surrounding each



 9   defendant.



10   Q.  So in a larger scale, that information simply mirrored



11   your -- the results of the three cases that you were involved



12   with?



13   A.  Mine were split out, and I think it's sort of -- confirmed



14   what I -- I think had believed all along, that jurors can do a



15   good job if properly handled by the trial judge and properly



16   presented the -- the case properly presented to them in making



17   individual determinations.  I think that they really would try



18   to do that and they will be able to do that.



19            MR. RYAN:  Thank you, Mr. Coat.  No further questions,



20   your Honor.



21            THE COURT:  Mr. Tigar.



22                          CROSS-EXAMINATION



23   BY MR. TIGAR:



24   Q.  Dean Coat, my name is Michael Tigar, sir.



25   A.  Yes, sir.







                                                                 205



                           Andrew Coat - Cross



 1   Q.  We did meet in the Tenth Circuit when it sat in this



 2   building and you represented Dr. Sisney and I represented



 3   Mr. Anthony?



 4   A.  You have a very good memory.  That's right.



 5   Q.  We were on opposite sides then.



 6            When is --



 7   A.  I didn't remember that.  I remembered we were there.  I



 8   didn't remember which side we were.



 9   Q.  You said your client was a victim of my client so --



10   A.  I'm sure it was.



11   Q.  When's the first time that you had any knowledge or



12   involvement about the -- this case?  Were you asked to be on a



13   list of lawyers?



14   A.  I don't know that I was asked to be on the list of lawyers.



15   I was asked -- Judge Russell did ask me to -- to consider being



16   involved in the defense of the case, if that's what you mean.



17   Q.  Yes.  Which -- did he tell who he wanted -- who he had in



18   mind for you to represent?



19   A.  Yes.  I think Mr. McVeigh.



20   Q.  And did you refuse?



21   A.  I -- he called me on a Friday afternoon -- I got home and



22   my wife said Judge Russell wanted to hear from me either at his



23   home or his office, so I knew that there was something unusual



24   afoot.  And he did offer me that opportunity.  And I thought



25   about it all weekend and, for a number of reasons, decided that







                                                                 206



                           Andrew Coat - Cross



 1   it would not be the best thing to do, and I declined.



 2   Q.  And in fact, your firm, Crowe & Dunlevy, has represented



 3   victims or victims' estates; is that correct?



 4   A.  That's right.  That's so.  And -- and for another -- a



 5   number of other reasons, I felt like it was inappropriate for



 6   me to do that.



 7   Q.  Is there some reason why you thought it was appropriate for



 8   you to appear as a witness for the prosecution in this case, an



 9   expert, having declined to serve as counsel for the defense?



10   A.  I think so.  It seems to me those things are entirely



11   unrelated, frankly, as to whether the trial should be severed



12   or not or whether I had personal reasons not to take the



13   defense case.



14   Q.  Now, you were district attorney of Oklahoma County from



15   1976 to 1980; correct?



16   A.  Yes, sir.  That's correct.



17   Q.  Thereafter, you were mayor of Oklahoma City; right?



18   A.  I was some years later, yes.



19   Q.  And you know of personally a number of people who were



20   touched by the events of April --



21   A.  I do.



22   Q.  -- '95?



23   A.  I did, yes.



24   Q.  And you feel for them, don't you, sir?



25   A.  Very much.







                                                                 207



                           Andrew Coat - Cross



 1   Q.  You want to see justice done, don't you, sir?



 2   A.  I do.



 3   Q.  Now, in 1976, that was an important year in the Supreme



 4   Court's decision-making in capital cases, wasn't it, sir?



 5   A.  It was, indeed.



 6   Q.  Because the court upheld a number of state statutes that



 7   had reinstituted the death penalty after Furman; correct?



 8   A.  That's correct.



 9   Q.  But, in fact, sir, the Eddings vs. Oklahoma hadn't been



10   decided by the time you left office, had it, sir?



11   A.  That's right.



12   Q.  And Eddings was the case in which the Supreme Court told us



13   some very important things about the treatment of mitigating



14   evidence and the breadth that was to be given to the defense;



15   is that right, sir?



16   A.  That's right.



17   Q.  All of your capital cases are pre-Eddings capital cases;



18   right?



19   A.  That is true.



20   Q.  Now, you said you tried approximately 14 capital cases?



21   A.  I think so.  Something like that.



22   Q.  And what was the quickest verdict you ever had in a capital



23   case?



24   A.  A matter of -- a number of hours.  Three, four, five hours.



25   Q.  What's the quickest verdict you've ever had in any case?







                                                                 208



                           Andrew Coat - Cross



 1   A.  I've had some where they hardly left the box, but -- both



 2   for and against, I might add.



 3   Q.  So certainly, under 15 or 20 minutes?



 4   A.  Yeah.  We had some very short ones, yes, sir.



 5   Q.  In other words, in the real world, it sometimes happens



 6   that verdicts are just as quick as Dr. Bronson's hypothetical



 7   verdicts; right, sir?



 8   A.  I would think so.



 9   Q.  Now, the last time you ever spoke to a juror about how they



10   dealt with the evidence in a capital case was in what year,



11   sir?



12   A.  Oh, it would have been '79 or '80.



13   Q.  So prior to Eddings against Oklahoma?



14   A.  Absolutely.



15   Q.  And prior to Penry vs. Lynaugh, obviously?



16   A.  That is so.



17   Q.  You believe, sir, don't you, that sometimes evidence can be



18   so prejudicial that even a judge's cautionary instruction is



19   not enough to keep the jurors from making improper use of it?



20   A.  I suppose there are some circumstances like that.



21   Q.  Well, in fact, sir, wouldn't you have said that the



22   deposition of Mr. Kohley in Marsee vs. United States Tobacco 



23   Company was a -- something in which it should have been



24   excluded, should be -- was properly excluded from the jury's



25   consideration?  In fact -- excuse me.  Just a minute.  Let me







                                                                 209



                           Andrew Coat - Cross



 1   finish my question.  Because the jury was likely to give it



 2   greater weight than it was due?



 3   A.  We were certainly concerned about it.



 4   Q.  Well, you got Judge Russell to say that, didn't you?



 5   A.  Yes, sir.



 6   Q.  And you got the Tenth Circuit to affirm it, didn't you,



 7   sir?



 8   A.  Absolutely.



 9   Q.  So there's one example in which jury instructions are to no



10   avail; correct?



11   A.  I wouldn't say they were to no avail.  We were successful



12   in getting the evidence excluded.  We were glad we did.  We



13   thought it should have been excluded.  I'm not certain that the



14   effect would have been with the proper precautionary



15   instruction; but you're certainly right, we did get it



16   excluded.



17   Q.  And have you ever tried a case or been involved in a case



18   in which a jury is considering a capital sentence under a jury



19   sentencing weighing statute?



20   A.  Well, ours were like that.  I mean, we had a -- an original



21   trial, a guilt phase, and then a -- then a sentencing phase in



22   which any kind of evidence would -- could come in about the



23   defendant.  So we did have those two-stage proceedings.  We had



24   it in not only capital cases but a number of other cases.  So



25   to that degree, yes.  They all were.







                                                                 210



                           Andrew Coat - Cross



 1   Q.  But again, you're talking about that period before the



 2   Supreme Court made it clear to the State of Oklahoma what was



 3   and was not the scope of a mitigating evidence; right?



 4   A.  Well, except that the fact is that our judges would let



 5   almost anything in in mitigation that the defense wanted to



 6   offer.  I mean, I don't think that anybody -- I don't recall



 7   any objections to any evidence coming in, and I don't recall



 8   any circumstances where everything, psychological workups on



 9   the person accused, family matters, that sort of thing, all



10   came into evidence, which is, I think, pretty much like what



11   you would expect to find today.



12   Q.  In the -- you said the Oklahoma statute.  Is each



13   individual juror able to decide what is and is not mitigating



14   and that becomes mitigation for that juror?



15   A.  I think that's the fact.



16   Q.  I didn't ask if it was fact.  I asked whether the statute



17   resembles the federal statute.



18   A.  It may have been a little more restrictive at that time,



19   but it was still an open question as to what mitigation was.



20   Q.  Now, in your discussion with Mr. Ryan, you were careful to



21   say some nice things about me and Mr. Jones.  Do you think that



22   capable lawyers who have antagonistic defenses are capable of



23   trying to pin the blame on the co-defendant?  Is that one of



24   the things that capable lawyers can do?



25   A.  They certainly do that some, yes.







                                                                 211



                           Andrew Coat - Cross



 1   Q.  And do you think that capable lawyers are capable of taking



 2   what a co-defendant's lawyer has done and use it to turn it



 3   against that co-defendant?



 4   A.  Well, I mean it works both ways.  You have both lawyers who



 5   are very good lawyers doing both the prosecuting and defending



 6   in that sense; and they can, certainly.



 7   Q.  And just -- when you were a prosecutor and you saw two



 8   defense lawyers representing co-defendants starting to cut each



 9   other up, didn't you just smile inwardly?



10   A.  I hope it was inwardly.



11            MR. TIGAR:  No further questions.



12            THE COURT:  Mr. Ryan, do you?



13            MR. RYAN:  Nothing further, your Honor.



14            THE COURT:  All right.  You may step down.  And you're



15   excusing the witness, I trust.



16            MR. RYAN:  Yes, your Honor.



17            THE COURT:  All right.



18            MR. RYAN:  Yes, your Honor.



19            THE COURT:  Mr. Mackey?



20            MR. MACKEY:  Thank you, your Honor.  Call Robert



21   Grant.



22            THE COURT:  All right.  If you will come forward to be



23   sworn.



24       (Robert Grant was sworn.)



25            COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Please be seated.







                                                                 212







 1            Please state your full name and spell your last name



 2   for the record.



 3            THE WITNESS:  My name is Robert Grant, G-r-a-n-t.



 4                         DIRECT EXAMINATION



 5   BY MR. MACKEY:



 6   Q.  Mr. Grant, tell the Court where you reside.



 7   A.  I live in Brighton, Colorado.



 8   Q.  And how long in Colorado?



 9   A.  I've been in Colorado since 1973.



10   Q.  Would you outline for the Court your educational



11   background.



12   A.  I grew up in the East, in Connecticut, went through schools



13   there.  Started at the University of Rochester in the mid --



14   '60s.  Decided that's not really what I wanted to do.  Joined



15   the Army.  Spent a few years in the Army, including a tour of



16   duty in Vietnam.  Came back to Connecticut.  Matriculated at



17   the University of Connecticut, graduated there in 1973 with a



18   B.A. in political science.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa.  Came



19   from Connecticut to the University of Colorado.  Went to law



20   school at CU.  Graduated in 1976.



21   Q.  And during the past 20 years, then, have you practiced law



22   in this state?



23   A.  I have.



24   Q.  Where?



25   A.  I have -- in January of 1977, I joined the staff of the







                                                                 213



                          Robert Grant - Direct



 1   district attorney's office in Adams County.  Brighton is the



 2   county seat of Adams County.  Adams County is just to the north



 3   and extends to the east of Denver.  I have practiced as



 4   prosecutor since then.  Prior to that, while I was in school, I



 5   was an intern with the law firm of Leonard Chesler for all



 6   three years of my -- of my law school career and the first two



 7   months of my legal career.



 8   Q.  Have you held different positions with the Adams County



 9   district attorney's office over those some 20 years?



10   A.  I have.  I started as a deputy district attorney, worked in



11   just about every phase of the prosecution business.  As a



12   deputy, I worked traffic misdemeanor and juvenile cases.  Then



13   became a chief trial deputy in the felony division.  Became



14   assistant district attorney in 1983 and was elected as district



15   attorney for my first term in 1992.  I am up for reelection



16   this November for my second term.



17   Q.  You are currently, then, the district attorney for the 17th



18   Judicial District?



19   A.  I am, sir.



20   Q.  Mr. Grant, over those 20-some years, have you had occasion



21   to supervise, participate in, or otherwise become familiar with



22   prosecution of homicide cases in Adams County?



23   A.  I have.



24   Q.  Could you outline that experience, please.



25   A.  I think I tried my first homicide case -- it was a 1979







                                                                 214



                          Robert Grant - Direct



 1   case, probably tried in 1980.  Since then, I've personally



 2   tried 17 or 18 first-degree murder cases.  As a chief trial



 3   deputy, beginning in 1980 or '81, I had supervisory



 4   responsibility for those homicide cases in my division.  And



 5   then as an assistant district attorney from 1983 on and as



 6   D.A., all of the homicide trials would have been under my



 7   supervision.



 8   Q.  Since 1980, have you supervised approximately 200 homicide



 9   cases in that judicial district?



10   A.  Yeah.  That's an estimate.  Based on about -- we get



11   anywhere from 12 to 15 a year in Adams County.



12   Q.  And have you served as assigned counsel to six cases in



13   which the death penalty was declared?



14   A.  That's correct.



15   Q.  Could you tell the Court what you mean by "assigned as



16   counsel" in those cases.



17   A.  I was assigned -- generally assigned myself as lead counsel



18   in those cases with the concurrence of the district attorney at



19   that time.  Two cases were actually tried.  The other four were



20   not, for various reasons.



21   Q.  And what two capital cases or death penalty cases have you



22   tried in Adams County to death-qualified jurors?



23   A.  In 1987 I tried the case of People vs. Gary Lee Davis.  His



24   case is currently pending before the Tenth Circuit Court of



25   Appeals.  And in 1993, I tried the case of People vs. Robert 







                                                                 215



                          Robert Grant - Direct



 1   Harlan, which is just beginning its sojourn through the



 2   appellate courts.



 3   Q.  Each of those cases involved a single defendant at trial?



 4   A.  That's correct.  The Davis case, there were two defendants



 5   originally charged.  However, the death penalty was sought



 6   against only one of them, and they were tried separately.



 7   Q.  Do you currently hold any positions with the Colorado



 8   District Attorneys Council?



 9   A.  Yes, I do.  I've been with the District Attorneys Council



10   since 1983.  I am the president-elect of the District Attorneys



11   Council, will take office next October.  I'm also a member of



12   the legislative committee and have been for a number of years



13   and am chairman of the capital litigation committee of the



14   Colorado District Attorneys Council and have been for a number



15   of years.



16   Q.  And are you a member of the Association of Government



17   Attorneys engaged in capital litigation?



18   A.  That's correct.  That's a national association that has an



19   annual seminar somewhere in the United States.



20   Q.  Over the years, have you been invited, Mr. Grant, to



21   testify before the Colorado legislature concerning the death



22   penalty in this state?



23   A.  I have.  And I tried to count the number of times and I



24   couldn't.  It's six or seven, around that.  I've been involved



25   with legislation in the death penalty area in Colorado since







                                                                 216



                          Robert Grant - Direct



 1   about 1986.



 2   Q.  And similarly, have you offered the prosecution



 3   perspective, if you will, on capital litigation in this state,



 4   either to college courses or to other prosecuting bodies?



 5   A.  I have.  I speak regularly and have spoken regularly at the



 6   annual District Attorneys Council conference, which is a



 7   three-day conference held every year.  The subject generally



 8   has been involving the death penalty.  I have been on numerous



 9   panels and debates around this state at various college and



10   school functions.  I also am invited annually to give a



11   different perspective to Mr. David Lane's class at the



12   University of Denver School of Law regarding capital



13   litigation.



14   Q.  And have you made it your practice over the years to follow



15   capital litigation in the state even when your office or



16   your -- your judicial district was not involved?



17   A.  I have, particularly with my role as -- as chairman of the



18   capital litigation committee and on the legislative committee



19   of the CDAC.



20   Q.  Based on that experience as a whole, then, do you feel



21   qualified to render opinions about capital litigation in this



22   state?



23   A.  I do.



24            MR. MACKEY:  We tender the witness as so qualified.



25            MR. TIGAR:  No objection, your Honor.







                                                                 217



                          Robert Grant - Direct



 1            THE COURT:  All right.  You may proceed.



 2   BY MR. MACKEY:



 3   Q.  Mr. Grant, you were in court earlier today when Mr. Wymore



 4   testified?



 5   A.  I was.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Wymore and I were



 6   classmates at the University of Colorado law school.



 7   Q.  And with that in mind, because it's the end of the day and



 8   I don't want to duplicate, could you give the Court an overview



 9   of the application the Colorado death penalty statute as it



10   existed at the time juries made that decision.



11   A.  Certainly.  In brief, your Honor, the -- the statute in



12   Colorado involves four steps and a four-step deliberation



13   process.  That's been a hallmark of the -- the statute for many



14   years.  The qualification, obviously, is that a jury has to



15   find guilt as to a class-one felony, first-degree murder,



16   before the capital stage is invoked.



17            The first step is that the jury must find beyond a



18   reasonable doubt whether at least one aggravating factor as



19   listed in the statute exists.  If they find one or more



20   aggravating factors, then they are to consider the existence of



21   mitigation.  The difference between the state statute here and



22   the federal statute is that there is no burden of proof with



23   respect to mitigation.  It's simply a burden of persuasion to



24   the extent that they find it exists or doesn't exist.  How they



25   weigh it is up to them.







                                                                 218



                          Robert Grant - Direct



 1            The third stage is then to weigh the aggravation that



 2   they have found beyond a reasonable doubt against any



 3   mitigation that they are considering and make a determination



 4   as to whether or not the mitigation outweighs that aggravation.



 5            The fourth and final step is given that weighing



 6   consideration, do they believe that the death penalty is the



 7   appropriate penalty under all the circumstances of this case.



 8            THE COURT:  And is there a requirement that the



 9   mitigating factor be found out to whatever level unanimously?



10            THE WITNESS:  No, your Honor.  There is no -- no such



11   requirement.



12            THE COURT:  Okay.



13            THE WITNESS:  Each juror is allowed to consideration



14   mitigation in their own individual consideration.



15   BY MR. MACKEY:



16   Q.  In your judgment, Mr. Grant, are there any other material



17   differences between the Colorado death penalty statute again as



18   one supplied by the jury and current federal statute?



19   A.  Sure.  There -- there are -- some of the aggravators are



20   different.  Some of the mitigators are different.  There is



21   the -- both of them are similar in that it's open-ended



22   mitigation.  Anything that the court considers to be mitigation



23   is allowed in as relevant.



24            The certification upon the finding of a verdict was



25   interesting.  That is not part of the Colorado statute.







                                                                 219



                          Robert Grant - Direct



 1   Certification having to do with the fact that the verdict was



 2   not rendered in a racially-biased or gender-biased,



 3   religious-biased means.  I don't think that there are any other



 4   major differences, sir.



 5   Q.  Mr. Grant, in your practice, have you -- would you say that



 6   Colorado courts, trial courts routinely provide an



 7   individualized instruction to a Colorado death-qualified jury



 8   before giving that decision to them?



 9   A.  Yes.  It's -- that's been my experience.  There is not a



10   stock instruction.  In fact, the State of Colorado does not



11   have stock jury instructions with respect to the death penalty.



12   I also sit on the Criminal Jury Instructions committee.  And



13   although we have debated that for a number of years, we



14   essentially gave up because of the -- the makeup of the



15   committee was not able to agree.  And then, of course, last



16   year, the legislature took that decision from jurors.



17            But that lack of stock instruction has not really



18   affected the practice.  Colorado, the statutory scheme requires



19   that the decision be made based on the facts of the crime and



20   the individual characteristics of the defendant, character,



21   background and history, given that tendered instructions from



22   defense counsel are routinely given, individualizing that



23   decision.



24   Q.  Just to bring the record complete to present, could you



25   tell the Court what the current version of the Colorado death







                                                                 220



                          Robert Grant - Direct



 1   penalty statute provides?



 2   A.  As of last year, the legislature changed the statute to



 3   allow for judicial sentencing.  The statute is the same in all



 4   other respects except that a three-judge panel now will make



 5   the death penalty after a verdict of guilt is rendered on a



 6   first-degree murder charge.



 7            That panel will be chosen randomly in a -- the chief



 8   justice of the Supreme Court has set out different regions from



 9   which the judges will be chosen, and the two other judges in



10   addition to the trial judge will sit and listen to the penalty



11   phase and render a decision.  That decision, if it's to be



12   death, must be unanimous.  If one of the three judges votes for



13   life, then the sentence is life.



14   Q.  But the four steps that you identified earlier would be as



15   applicable to the three-judge panel as to the twelve-member



16   jury panel previously?



17   A.  That's correct.  I kind of envision it as a jury of three.



18   There haven't been any cases tried under that system yet.



19   Q.  Mr. Grant, prior to your testimony today, did I ask you to



20   reconstruct an accurate history of death penalty jury trials in



21   the state of Colorado?



22   A.  Yes, sir.



23   Q.  Did you endeavor to do so, you and your staff?



24   A.  Yes, I did.



25   Q.  Would you describe to the Court just briefly what steps you







                                                                 221



                          Robert Grant - Direct



 1   undertook to ensure its completeness.



 2   A.  Sure.  Many of the cases I was familiar with, Judge, from



 3   having talked to a number of prosecutors and being a



 4   participant for as long as I have been.  In those cases that I



 5   did not know the particular answers to the questions that



 6   Mr. Mackey asked me, I made contact, either myself or my



 7   assistant district attorney, Stephen Bernard -- made contact



 8   with the individual jurisdictions.  We also did make contact



 9   with each judicial district in the state of Colorado to



10   ascertain whether there were any other cases that we were not



11   aware of.  And that was the basis for preparing the charts.



12   Q.  Did you, in fact, compile your research into a summary



13   exhibit?



14   A.  I did.



15   Q.  Do you find one before you marked Government Exhibit No. 7?



16   A.  I do.



17   Q.  Directing your attention, Mr. Grant, to Exhibit No. 7.  Is



18   that one entitled Results of All Death Penalty Hearing Jury



19   Verdicts in Colorado by District and Trial Site?



20   A.  I have that, sir.



21   Q.  Could you tell the Judge what information is meant to be



22   captured on Exhibit No. 7.



23   A.  Your Honor, the headings kind of speak for themselves.



24   This represents all of the jury verdicts in the state of



25   Colorado from 1979, which is when the post-Furman statute was







                                                                 222



                          Robert Grant - Direct



 1   enacted, through 1996.  The total at the bottom is a



 2   compilation of each judicial district that has had a tried case



 3   to the death-qualified jury.  And then the second column is



 4   those who were, in fact, convicted of capital crimes,



 5   eliminating those that were convicted less than first-degree



 6   murder.  The third is the life verdicts returned, and the



 7   fourth is the death verdicts returned.



 8   Q.  Incidentally, Mr. Grant, how many counties are there in the



 9   state of Colorado?



10   A.  63, I believe.



11   Q.  How are they organized in terms of judicial districts?



12   A.  There are 22 judicial districts in the state of Colorado.



13   There are some judicial districts that are single counties.



14   The majority of them are multiple counties.



15   Q.  Based on your research and as reflected in Exhibit 7, did



16   you find that some nine or less than half of those judicial



17   districts have seated death-qualified juries in that time



18   period?



19   A.  That's correct.  From my research, this is all of the



20   judicial districts that have ever tried capital cases to a



21   death-qualified jury.



22   Q.  Between 1979 and last year?



23   A.  And 1996; correct.



24   Q.  Thank you.  For the record, what was the total number of



25   defendants tried by death-qualified juries in the state of







                                                                 223



                          Robert Grant - Direct



 1   Colorado during that time?



 2   A.  38.



 3   Q.  And the number of defendants who proceeded to the death



 4   penalty hearing?



 5   A.  27.



 6   Q.  And the number of life verdicts by jury?



 7   A.  19.



 8   Q.  And the number of death verdicts by jury?



 9   A.  Eight.



10   Q.  Let me turn your attention, Mr. Grant, to Government



11   Exhibit 8.  Do you have that before you?



12   A.  I do.



13   Q.  Does the information reflected on No. 8 correspond with



14   that set forth in No. 7?



15   A.  That's correct.  Exhibit 8 is a -- a more detailed listing



16   that goes through the last names of each of the defendants that



17   were tried before death-qualified juries in each of the



18   judicial districts and then those that received life verdicts



19   and those that received death verdicts.  At the end of Exhibit



20   8, the nine footnotes correspond to numbered note -- notations



21   in the exhibit itself, explaining some irregularities, if you



22   will, about -- or some important points about those particular



23   cases.



24   Q.  You've attempted by footnote in Exhibit No. 8 to offer



25   certain material history about the particular case or more?







                                                                 224



                          Robert Grant - Direct



 1   A.  That's correct.



 2   Q.  In your survey, did you identify the number of cases in the



 3   Colorado modern death penalty history that had more than one



 4   defendant facing the death penalty in the same trial?



 5   A.  That's correct.



 6   Q.  And how many such cases?



 7   A.  That were actually tried together, there have only been



 8   two.



 9   Q.  And how many such cases were there where more than one



10   defendant faced an announced or declared death penalty in



11   Colorado?



12   A.  As far as I could determine, there were five.



13   Q.  What were the two cases that proceeded to trial in Colorado



14   where more than one defendant faced the death penalty?



15   A.  In 1981, Edgar Durre and James Manners were tried together



16   in Weld County.  That's in Greeley.  And in 1987, Mr. Borrego



17   and Mr. Lucero were tried together in Jefferson County.  That's



18   the case that Mr. Wymore represented Mr. Borrego.



19   Q.  And is additional information about each of those joint



20   trials set forth in Government Exhibit 6?



21   A.  That's correct.



22   Q.  Is that accurate information as it relates to those two



23   cases?



24   A.  That is.



25   Q.  What were the results in those two jointly tried cases in







                                                                 225



                          Robert Grant - Direct



 1   the state of Colorado?



 2   A.  All of the defendants were sentenced to life.  There is



 3   somewhat of a -- an errata with respect to Mr. Durre.  An



 4   interesting case.  And I've set forth the Colorado Supreme



 5   Court citation to that case.  Mr. Durre, when he was tried, the



 6   jury was asked to return a verdict on a verdict form that



 7   indicated that they were to say whether or not there was



 8   sufficient mitigation to outweigh aggravation and, therefore,



 9   justify a life sentence.  The jury foreman signed that verdict



10   form no.  However, when that jury verdict was rendered in



11   court, the jury foreman also passed a note to the judge that



12   said there -- there is not unanimity in the jury with respect



13   to the penalty of death.  Seven of the juror members would



14   agree with the court if the court were to sentence Mr. Durre to



15   death.  Five of the jury members would not impose the death



16   penalty.



17            The judge in that case regarding -- or disregarded



18   that note to the extent of sentencing and sentenced Mr. Durre



19   to death.  That death sentence was overturned by the Colorado



20   Supreme Court in the 1984 decision noted here.  So it's listed



21   here as a life sentence.  And in fact, since it was not a



22   unanimous death verdict under Colorado law at the time, it's



23   fairly obvious that it could not have been a death sentence



24   upheld.



25   Q.  So neither of the two Colorado juries that faced joint







                                                                 226



                          Robert Grant - Direct



 1   death penalty defendant trials rendered unanimous votes of



 2   death on any of the four defendants?



 3   A.  No.  They both gave life sentences, including the -- for



 4   the defendant that Mr. Wymore represented.



 5            MR. MACKEY:  Your Honor, I would move into admission



 6   Government Exhibits 6 and 7 and 8.



 7            MR. TIGAR:  No objection, your Honor.



 8            THE COURT:  They are received.



 9   BY MR. MACKEY:



10   Q.  Mr. Grant, perhaps for reasons similar to Mr. Coat's



11   description earlier, have you made it a practice over the years



12   to talk to jurors that have tried -- heard trials involving



13   death penalty cases?



14   A.  I have.  And I've been warned against it numerous times,



15   but I never heeded those warnings.  I've talked to jurors in my



16   entire prosecution practice.



17   Q.  Can you quantify for the Court what background you have



18   with regard to that practice?



19   A.  With respect to death penalty jurors, I've talked to, I



20   would say, anywhere from two dozen to 25 to 30 individual



21   jurors.  Some in groups.  Some individually.  The Gary Davis



22   jury was somewhat unique in that they had a reunion that they



23   invited me to the year after the verdict was rendered.  I spent



24   some time talking with them there and had previously.  I've



25   also talked to jurors in other jurisdictions about cases that







                                                                 227



                          Robert Grant - Direct



 1   were tried in other jurisdictions that were of interest to me,



 2   particularly involving changes in legislation.



 3   Q.  Without being specific at this point, have jurors in those



 4   sessions described to you in their own way, their own words,



 5   what it's been like to sit in judgment of another individual?



 6   A.  Yes.  And I've particularly asked those kinds of questions.



 7   One of the things that a district attorney does in making a



 8   decision whether to seek the death penalty is determine the



 9   likelihood of such a verdict.  I also felt it was important to



10   talk to people that had been in that situation after they



11   deliberated to make future judgments about the likelihood of



12   verdicts.



13   Q.  Mr. Grant, have you formed an opinion about the sense of



14   responsibility Colorado potential jurors carry to the task of



15   deciding life and death verdicts?



16   A.  I have.



17   Q.  Is that based at least in part on your experience of



18   interviewing those jurors?



19   A.  It is.



20   Q.  And your study of the Colorado death penalty history?



21   A.  It is.



22   Q.  And your own practice in trying those cases?



23   A.  It is.  Specifically within that last regard with respect



24   to jury:  In questioning jurors in Colorado and in the cases



25   that I've been involved with, it's an individual voir dire







                                                                 228



                          Robert Grant - Direct



 1   situation that has taken place over a period of many, many



 2   days.  And talking to jurors in that setting also gives you a



 3   good flavor for their degree of attentiveness.



 4   Q.  Would you tell Judge Matsch at this time, Mr. Grant, what



 5   that opinion is and the basis for it.



 6   A.  Your Honor, it's my belief and opinion that jurors in this



 7   case or in this state that I've been in contact with are



 8   extremely conscientious.  I have been impressed repeatedly by



 9   the gravity of the decision-making process that they related to



10   me.  Many of them have expressed the opinion that it's the most



11   monumental decision they have ever made, including getting



12   married, buying houses and things like that.  They have all



13   reflected a degree of focus and concentration and severity of



14   judgment that is unique, at least in my experience, with



15   respect to any kind of group dynamics.  It's -- it really



16   stands out.



17   Q.  Mr. Grant, after 20 years of serving the people of Adams



18   County, have you come to recognize more than one school of



19   thought among prosecutors about the relative tactical



20   advantages or disadvantages of multiple defendant death penalty



21   cases?



22   A.  I have.  That's fair.



23   Q.  And what are those two schools of thought as you observed



24   them?



25   A.  Well, to -- to the extent that jurors may combine thoughts







                                                                 229



                          Robert Grant - Direct



 1   about multiple defendants, I am of the school of thought that



 2   believes that -- that jurors do not want to impose the death



 3   penalty.  They start with an inherent bias against the death



 4   penalty which, you know, is -- is very basic, very



 5   foundational.  Killing is wrong.  That's what we believe as



 6   human beings.  They start with that bias.  They are looking for



 7   reasons not to impose that penalty as opposed to the other side



 8   where they're, you know, blood-thirsty, blood dripping off



 9   their teeth kind of folks.  That is not my view of them.



10            In that regard, the one school of thought is that a --



11   a defendant with a lesser degree of culpability, a lesser



12   degree of involvement, a more regular or more seemingly



13   appropriate upbringing, that feeling might tend to bleed over



14   into one with the opposite background.  And if death is not



15   going to impose on that lesser culpable defendant, then the



16   likelihood is it would not be imposed on the more culpable



17   defendant.



18            There is, of course, the other school of thought that



19   would go the other way.  I think the third school of thought



20   has been expressed here today as well, and that is that jurors



21   can and will make individual determinations without bleeding



22   over into each circumstance.



23   Q.  These theories and schools of thought as you've described



24   them condense in your experience to a single confidence that



25   juries that have that duty will follow the court's instructions







                                                                 230



                          Robert Grant - Direct



 1   and give individualized consideration to the defendants?



 2   A.  I'm convinced of that.  I -- my own experience with the



 3   Davis case underlines that for me.  In the Davis case, Gary



 4   Davis was charged and -- and we, in fact, sought the death



 5   penalty against Gary.  And his wife, Becky Davis, was charged



 6   with first-degree murder and the same basic crimes, but we did



 7   not seek the death penalty against her.



 8            She was tried first.  In her trial, of course, the



 9   defense was Gary did it all.  Gary made me do it.  She was



10   convicted, sentenced to life.  In his trial, that defense was



11   reversed.  And the -- the consideration at the penalty phase



12   was very heavily weighted against if Becky Davis didn't get the



13   death penalty, then Gary shouldn't, either.



14            In speaking with the jurors in both of those cases and



15   specifically in Gary Davis's case, they said, well, wait a



16   minute, we had to look at Gary Davis's situation and



17   circumstances separate and, in fact, did that to the degree



18   that -- that they separated out Becky's actions -- what they



19   knew about Becky's background, and her testimony was admitted



20   at his trial and Gary's actions and Gary's background.  I was



21   impressed with that.



22   Q.  Mr. Grant, did you hear earlier today Mr. Wymore's



23   testimony where he used the phrase "mitigation-impaired"?



24   A.  Yeah.  I did.



25   Q.  Could you summarize for the Judge what you understood







                                                                 231



                          Robert Grant - Direct



 1   Mr. Wymore to mean on that point.



 2   A.  Well, my understanding, not only from his testimony but



 3   from having tried cases against the public defenders and



 4   talking to others who have, is that their theory is that a -- a



 5   person is disqualified from juror service if they will not give



 6   appropriate weight to whatever mitigation fact they are



 7   presented.  I think he used age.  Alcohol has been used before.



 8   And the theory is we can challenge for cause -- the defense can



 9   challenge for cause a juror who says, well, okay, I'll listen



10   to your testimony about alcohol, but that's not going to make a



11   difference to me.  To my knowledge, that theory has not been



12   accepted by any appellate court in the state of Colorado.



13            Obviously, the jury selection standard is the same as



14   the federal standard, the Wainwright and Witt standard.  And



15   that has to do with their ability to -- to render a verdict in



16   accordance with the law and whether or not that ability is



17   substantially impaired.  It doesn't have to do with whether or



18   not they give any weight to a particular mitigator or a



19   particular aggravator.



20   Q.  Certainly, Mr. Grant, did you hear Mr. Stevenson testify



21   earlier in the day about the presumption of death in highly



22   publicized cases with very aggravated circumstances of crime?



23   A.  Sure.



24   Q.  And did you apply that notion against your own experience



25   here in the state of Colorado?







                                                                 232



                          Robert Grant - Direct



 1   A.  I did.  As I listened to him testify, I thought immediately



 2   of three cases that -- that would mitigate against that



 3   assertion.  One here in Denver, the James King case, which was



 4   a -- a very highly publicized case, and the tenure of the



 5   publicity was very heavily weighted against Mr. King's guilt.



 6   Mr. King was acquitted even though he killed four security



 7   guards, allegedly, during a bank holdup.



 8            Two other cases that come to mind involved the death



 9   of -- of law enforcement officers, one the Templeman case out



10   of Colorado Springs in 1984 where a state patrol officer was



11   killed, and the other, the Marvin Walker case in Adams County



12   in 1988 where a -- a police officer -- a policewoman in Aurora



13   was killed.  In both cases, both of which were highly



14   publicized, sensationalized, if you will, in the state of



15   Colorado -- in both of those cases, the jury returned verdicts



16   of first-degree murder against the defendants and rendered



17   penalty decisions for life as opposed to death.  That seems to



18   me to be fairly contrary to what was testified to earlier by



19   Mr. Stevenson.



20            MR. MACKEY:  I have nothing else, your Honor.



21            THE COURT:  Mr. Tigar?



22                          CROSS-EXAMINATION



23   BY MR. TIGAR:



24   Q.  Mr. Grant, please, my name is Michael Tigar.  I represent



25   Mr. Nichols.







                                                                 233



                           Robert Grant - Cross



 1   A.  Good afternoon, Mr. Tigar.



 2   Q.  Good afternoon.  The three cases that you just told us



 3   about, those were individual trials; is that right, sir?



 4   A.  That's correct.



 5   Q.  And when you talked about that Harlan case, that was one



 6   you prosecuted up in Adams County; correct?



 7   A.  Yes, sir.



 8   Q.  And you got a death verdict?



 9   A.  Yes, sir.



10   Q.  How many days of voir dire did you have for just that one



11   defendant?



12   A.  I think it was 10 or 11.



13   Q.  More than two weeks; correct?



14   A.  Yes.  I believe it went into the third week.  There was --



15   I think we had a day in there where the court gave us the



16   opportunity to review questionnaires that wasn't actual voir 



17   dire, but we had a day to review the questionnaires before we



18   went into individual voir dire.



19   Q.  And was that voir dire all conducted by the lawyers or



20   mostly conducted by the lawyers?



21   A.  It depended on how the judge felt that day.  It was mostly



22   conducted by the lawyers, yes, sir.



23   Q.  You mentioned "mitigation-impaired."  Are you familiar with



24   the case Mr. Wymore mentioned, Morgan vs. Illinois?



25   A.  Yes, certainly.







                                                                 234



                           Robert Grant - Cross



 1   Q.  And you just disagree with his reading of it?



 2   A.  I do.  And I'm not aware of any Colorado case law that



 3   upholds it.



 4   Q.  Now I'd like to ask you about that Davis case.



 5   A.  Yes, sir.



 6   Q.  You tried -- you charged Mr. Davis and Mrs. Davis; correct?



 7   A.  I did.



 8   Q.  And Mrs. Davis moved for severance on the grounds of



 9   antagonistic defenses, disparity of proof, and different



10   decisions with respect to who was going to take the stand and



11   who not; correct?



12   A.  I looked at that severance motion when I faxed it down to



13   your office the other day.  I believe that's all of the



14   grounds.  It was a fairly brief motion.  But yeah, I think



15   you've covered them.



16   Q.  And did you consent to that motion?



17   A.  I made argument against some of the points, but didn't



18   argue strenuously against the motion.  Some of the things that



19   were said, I couldn't sit back and admit to so I -- I made some



20   argument, but the motion was granted essentially without very



21   much objection.  That's true.



22   Q.  Well, looking at the case of Mrs. -- now, Mrs. Davis was



23   the one that said she was lesser involved; correct?



24   A.  Actually, both of them did eventually, but, yes, at her



25   trial, she did, yes, sir.







                                                                 235



                           Robert Grant - Cross



 1   Q.  And you agreed with her to the extent that you did not seek



 2   a death penalty on her; is that right?



 3   A.  I did not seek the death penalty on her, but there were a



 4   lot of different reasons for that.  That being one of them.



 5   The available evidence at the time of the trial, yes, sir.



 6   Q.  And you -- as a prosecutor, you understand there's no joy



 7   in getting a death verdict, is there, sir?



 8   A.  I would agree with that.



 9   Q.  There's no joy on the part of jurors in returning one, is



10   there, sir?



11   A.  I would agree with that.



12   Q.  Your job as the prosecutor in Adams County is to get



13   verdicts that are just and then hold onto them on appeal;



14   correct?



15   A.  That's one of them, yes, sir.



16   Q.  And can you just share with us as you were thinking about;



17   are you going to stand in front of a judge in Adams County and



18   you're going to be real strong opposing Mrs. Davis's motion,



19   not so strong, were you thinking about is trying to work real



20   hard to get just one trial here worth the hassle I might face



21   on appeal?  Is that something that ran through your mind?



22   A.  I -- I suspect it probably did.  I don't latch onto that as



23   a major reason.  I suspect that's something that was a matter



24   of consideration, yes, sir.



25   Q.  Well, you believe that the death penalty is a deterrent to







                                                                 236



                           Robert Grant - Cross



 1   willful murder, do you not, sir?



 2   A.  I believe that.



 3   Q.  And its deterrent effect is seen when trials are held that



 4   command the respect of appellate courts; correct?



 5   A.  That's one facet, yes, sir.



 6   Q.  Now, you also told us, sir, that juries don't sentence



 7   anymore in Colorado; is that right?



 8   A.  That's correct under the current statute.  That -- of



 9   course, there hasn't been a case tried to the three judge panel



10   yet.



11   Q.  Now, the three judge panel, that was a Senate bill; is that



12   right?  Was that SB-54?  Have I got that wrong?



13   A.  I don't know.  It went through -- it went through both



14   houses and was signed by the Governor.  I'm not sure whether it



15   originated in the Senate or the house.



16   Q.  But you and Mr. Ritter and Mr. Suthers went up there and



17   testified for it; is that right?



18   A.  We did, yes, sir.



19   Q.  And why do you think that jurors in Colorado were not the



20   best people to be sentencing people in these capital cases?



21   A.  I don't think I'd agree with that statement, Mr. Tigar.



22   Q.  I'm sorry.  I -- I withdraw it because it assumes something



23   that I just don't know.



24            Tell us why you were in favor of Senate Bill 54 that



25   would have substituted the three-judge panel for juries.







                                                                 237



                           Robert Grant - Cross



 1   A.  There -- there were a number of reasons.  I actually was



 2   not a proponent of the change.  One of the reasons that I



 3   thought it was appropriate was consistency and I believe that



 4   was the thrust of my testimony before the legislative hearing



 5   and I think I told the legislative hearing that they should not



 6   vote for this bill in the expectation that it would increase



 7   the number of residents of Colorado's death row.  But rather,



 8   they should be impressed with the fact that judges make



 9   sentencing decisions on a regular basis and that if they were



10   seeking consistency in capital sentencing, that that would be a



11   by-product of judicial sentencing.



12   Q.  Did you have in mind any cases that had been tried in Adams



13   County, although perhaps by prosecutors from Arapahoe County,



14   that informed your judgment on that?



15   A.  I am certain that you're talking about the Allen Thomas



16   case and one of the -- one of the backgrounds to this



17   legislation had to do with our consideration of trying to pass



18   a nonunanimous verdict statute in the State of Colorado.



19   Q.  What happened in the Thomas case was that -- well, you tell



20   me.  Why didn't you get a death there?



21   A.  Actually, I was hoping to be able to try the Thomas case



22   myself and --



23   Q.  Why didn't they get a death there?



24   A.  The case was tried by the Arapahoe County district



25   attorney's office and in speaking with jurors after the case,







                                                                 238



                           Robert Grant - Cross



 1   the jury was essentially hung, 11 to 1, in favor of death with



 2   one juror who declined to participate in the deliberation



 3   process from the beginning.



 4   Q.  And you thought that that was not a good thing to have



 5   happened; correct?



 6   A.  I thought it was inappropriate that the jury felt that they



 7   could not even deliberate together as a whole but rather that



 8   one of them removed them -- themselves from the deliberation



 9   process.



10   Q.  So that's a juror who did not obey the judge's instructions



11   to deliberate; correct?



12   A.  In fact, I didn't agree with the judge's instructions,



13   either, Mr. Tigar, and the judge's instructions and comments



14   during the voir dire led the jurors to believe that they did



15   not have to deliberate.  That they did not have to take part in



16   any discussions in the jury room.  So in fact, that juror felt



17   that she was following the judge's instructions.



18   Q.  But that was just a misunderstanding then?



19   A.  I -- in my view, it was an error of law.



20   Q.  The Congress of the United States has said that with



21   respect to what is or is not a mitigating factor, each



22   individual juror is sovereign in the penalty process; isn't



23   that right?



24   A.  I haven't read those words, Mr. Tigar, but I agree with the



25   concept that jurors are allowed to give whatever weight







                                                                 239



                           Robert Grant - Cross



 1   individually they ascribe to particular mitigation.



 2   Q.  So under the law as passed by the Congress of the United



 3   States, each individual juror, as you understand it, can say I



 4   find X and Y and Z to be mitigating and I'm going to use that



 5   even if no other juror agrees that that's mitigating; is that



 6   right?



 7   A.  I believe that's correct.



 8   Q.  And if that juror holds onto that view under the statute as



 9   passed by the Congress of the United States, then that would



10   prevent unanimity with respect to death; is that correct?



11   A.  In that scenario, it would.



12   Q.  And that, of course, is the system -- that's something like



13   the system that used to exist in Colorado; correct?



14   A.  It very much is in terms of individual jurors being able to



15   give what weight they particularly ascribe to mitigation as



16   long as they participate in the deliberative process.



17   Q.  And that system that the Congress of the United States has



18   instituted does increase the risk of inconsistency as compared



19   to a system where judges alone sentence; isn't that right?



20   A.  Increase the risk of inconsistency -- I guess I'm not so



21   sure I would talk about risk of inconsistency.  I would say



22   that judges who make sentencing decisions on a daily basis are



23   more likely to be consistent in those sentencing decisions over



24   time than jurors who are recruited to make that decision once.



25   Q.  Let me put it in the context of Colorado then, sir.  The







                                                                 240



                           Robert Grant - Cross



 1   cold -- the old Colorado system that you were opposed to was



 2   more likely to create inconsistent results in death cases than



 3   the -- the new system where judges are doing it; isn't that



 4   correct?



 5   A.  Well, first of all, I was not opposed to the old Colorado



 6   system.  In fact, over my career, with due respect, I've always



 7   had more luck with jurors than with judges.  I think, again,



 8   judicial sentencing is more likely to be consistent given



 9   similar facts over time than juror sentencing.



10   Q.  And the federal courts have chosen jury sentencing;



11   correct?



12   A.  As did the Colorado courts for 100 years of its history.



13   Q.  Until you argued the legislature into changing it?



14   A.  I was one of those folks, that's true.



15            MR. TIGAR:  Nothing further.



16            MR. MACKEY:  Nothing, your Honor.  Thank you.



17            THE COURT:  You may step down, Mr. Grant.  I take it



18   he's excused.



19            MR. MACKEY:  Please, your Honor.



20            THE COURT:  You're excused.



21            THE WITNESS:  Thank you, sir.



22            MR. MACKEY:  Your Honor, we have no other witnesses.



23   We would move into admission certain other exhibits tendered to



24   the defense --



25            THE COURT:  All right.







                                                                 241







 1            MR. MACKEY:  -- I believe without objection with one



 2   exception.  Government Exhibit Number 1 being an affidavit of



 3   Ann Roberts that attaches the results of her search on federal



 4   capital sentencing set forth in Exhibits 2, 3, 4, and 5.



 5            THE COURT:  Yes.  Those being attachments 1, 2, 3, and



 6   4; right?



 7            MR. MACKEY:  Yes, your Honor.



 8            THE COURT:  And you filed this on -- yesterday?



 9            MR. MACKEY:  Yes, we did.



10            THE COURT:  Okay.



11            MR. THURSCHWELL:  No objection to those exhibits, your



12   Honor.



13            THE COURT:  All right.  They are received then as a



14   part of -- and the affidavit of Ms. Roberts.



15            MR. THURSCHWELL:  That's correct.



16            THE COURT:  All right.  Which is simply foundational



17   for the exhibits.



18            MR. MACKEY:  Precisely, your Honor.  In addition, we



19   move to admit Government Exhibit No. 9, that being a multi-page



20   declaration of Joseph Hoffman and would consent to the requests



21   of defense to supplement Mr. Hoffman's presentation with one



22   article referenced in his C.V.



23            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Your Honor, pursuant to Federal Rule



24   of Evidence 806, this article is somewhat inconsistent with



25   some of the assertions made in the affidavit itself.  It's







                                                                 242







 1   authored by the same individual.  It's admissible on that



 2   grounds.  With that objection, we would offer that.



 3            THE COURT:  So that's agreed to.



 4            MR. MACKEY:  It is, your Honor.



 5            THE COURT:  Where is the --



 6            MR. THURSCHWELL:  Your Honor, I thought we had brought



 7   it with us today.  We did not.  With the Court's indulgence, we



 8   can bring it tomorrow.  First thing tomorrow morning.



 9            THE COURT:  All right.



10            MR. MACKEY:  And in addition, and finally, your Honor,



11   offer the declaration of Dane Gillette, tendered this afternoon



12   to defense, setting forth that lawyer's research concerning the



13   results in California's death penalty cases.



14            THE COURT:  I don't think I've seen that.  Is that



15   submitted?



16            MR. TIGAR:  Shall I stand here or at the lectern?



17            THE COURT:  It'll be easier at the lectern for



18   everyone to hear.



19            MR. TIGAR:  Thank you.  Your Honor, this document was



20   faxed to the Government today and tendered to us after lunch.



21   I have -- it purports to contain research conducted on a



22   somewhat informal basis by a senior assistant attorney general.



23   I would --



24            THE COURT:  Do you want to look at it overnight?



25            MR. TIGAR:  I'd like to look at it overnight before I







                                                                 243







 1   take a position.  Maybe we can consent to it.  We'd like to



 2   look at it.



 3            THE COURT:  All right.



 4            MR. MACKEY:  I apologize for the late delay.



 5            THE COURT:  All right.  We'll take it up first thing



 6   in the morning.



 7            MR. MACKEY:  That will be all the exhibits we'd offer



 8   at this time, your Honor.



 9            THE COURT:  Any rebuttal type witnesses here?



10            MR. TIGAR:  No, your Honor.  We're -- we're quitting



11   as promised.



12            THE COURT:  All right.  Well, the evidentiary record



13   with respect to these motions then is complete.  And I propose



14   to argue -- hear argument on them first thing in the morning.



15            I don't see Mr. Kelley here.  We didn't notify him



16   that we might have 20 minutes left to consider his motion to



17   unseal.  So by the time we get him notice and get here, I think



18   it'll be 5:00, so I would propose that we recess.



19   Mr. Hartzler?



20            MR. HARTZLER:  One brief matter regarding scheduling.



21            THE COURT:  Yes.



22            MR. HARTZLER:  I understood we would hear evidence on



23   the severance motion at the conclusion of our meeting.



24   Mr. Tigar indicated that he would like to call witnesses on the



25   Nichols motion regarding the conditions of confinement.  He has







                                                                 244







 1   two witnesses that he's proposing.  It is not clear to us why



 2   those witnesses would be necessary.  One of them is the warden



 3   and the warden has plans to be out of town both tomorrow and



 4   Friday.  So I'm -- I would invite the Court to solicit from



 5   Mr. Tigar some indication as to what information we need and if



 6   truly we need testimony, then possibly reach a stipulation or



 7   something.



 8            THE COURT:  What was -- can you advise us on that?



 9            MR. TIGAR:  Yes, your Honor.  And I would like the



10   courtesy of when I'm told Government counsel witnesses would be



11   there and an objection is to be made that they are not going to



12   be here, that I be told about it beforehand.



13            MR. HARTZLER:  To that extent, I apologize, but I



14   didn't know until we contacted the witness.  So I mean, we were



15   told yesterday afternoon.  I apologize for not communicating it



16   to Mr. Tigar.  But this is obviously late notice.  These



17   motions have been on file for some time.



18            THE COURT:  Let's not go back and forth on that.  He's



19   not available.



20            MR. TIGAR:  Your Honor, in connection -- he's in



21   Aspen, your Honor.  The motion has -- their reply that they



22   filed yesterday had Warden Perrill's affidavit connected to it.



23   And Mr. May has relied upon for things that Warden Perrill



24   wants to tell the Court.  What's happening here, your Honor, is



25   that in a capital case in which prison discipline can be







                                                                 245







 1   admissible in the punishment phase of the -- of the trial -- if



 2   we ever get there -- things are being done at the prison that



 3   are, in our view, improper.  Warden Perrill says things in that



 4   affidavit that are flatly not true with respect to his



 5   involvement on Mr. Nichols' ongoing discussions with the prison



 6   about getting an adequate diet.  This is a situation in which



 7   Mr. Nichols has blown the whistle on a Government contractor



 8   who has been cheating the prison and being punished for it.  I



 9   think that Warden Perrill ought to be in here to explain this



10   because I don't think he's leveled with the Court.



11            Mr. May has also had conversations directly with



12   Mr. Nichols, has been involved in this kangaroo court



13   discipline out there and we think that he has some explaining



14   to do.  Sooner or later, Mr. May, who is the man who we have to



15   deal with every single day, your Honor, to see Mr. Nichols and



16   prepare this case, is going to have to account for somebody --



17   to somebody about the behavior.  We don't intend to harass



18   these witnesses, but we do think there are some questions that



19   they should be required to answer.



20            THE COURT:  Well, there are two things involved here,



21   then, as I understand it.  One is whether this Court should be



22   taking any action with respect to any remedy now.  The other is



23   whether the disciplinary record, if there be a disciplinary



24   record, should be admissible at some time in the penalty



25   hearing if there be one.  Those are two different --







                                                                 246







 1            MR. TIGAR:  Those are two different issues.  With



 2   respect to the Court's taking action, the only basis upon which



 3   the Government says this Court should not take action is the



 4   citation of an irrelevant portion of the Prisoner's Litigation



 5   Reform Act of 1996, which imposes administrative exhaustion



 6   requirements on civil suits not on motions made in criminal



 7   cases.  Other than that, I'm prepared to argue the -- the law.



 8   I could do it first thing in the morning to show your Honor



 9   there's a motion to be heard here.



10            THE COURT:  But I'm asking whether the warden's



11   testimony is necessary for this question of whether some



12   remedial action is appropriate.



13            MR. TIGAR:  Yes, your Honor, it is because the warden



14   has in his affidavit incorrectly characterized negotiations



15   that preceded Mr. Nichols coming to Colorado, incorrectly



16   characterized the punitive nature of the restriction of the



17   access of these two defendants to commissary rights,



18   incorrectly characterized the way in which Mr. Nichols has been



19   exercising his commissary rights, in --



20            THE COURT:  Well, you're in disagreement with his



21   declaration.



22            MR. TIGAR:  I'm sorry, your Honor.  I'm getting



23   carried away.  But those are the matters in which I'd



24   interrogate him.



25            THE COURT:  I don't know that I've read the







                                                                 247







 1   declaration.  It was filed yesterday and that -- that motion



 2   was down on my schedule later.  He's not available at all on



 3   Friday?



 4            MR. HARTZLER:  I could find out and report to the



 5   Court tomorrow morning.



 6            MR. TIGAR:  It's not a long ways to Aspen if there's



 7   no snow on the Pass, your Honor.



 8            THE COURT:  Well, find out what his schedule is and



 9   whether it's possible for him to be here Friday.



10            MR. HARTZLER:  I will.  Thank you.



11            THE COURT:  Thank you.  Back on the schedule then with



12   this additional matter of an exhibit, we'll be prepared for



13   argument on the motions at 9:00 in the morning.



14            MR. JONES:  Your Honor.



15            THE COURT:  Mr. Jones, we haven't heard from you all



16   day.



17            MR. JONES:  You were almost lucky, your Honor.  But



18   I'll be brief.  In our meetings with the Court from time to



19   time and in comments that have been made in Court, it occurs to



20   me that at some time, the Court may want to hear from counsel



21   for all parties with respect to the issues concerning the



22   composition of the jury, the amount of voir dire, whether the



23   jury will be anonymous, all those types of issues and



24   sequestered --



25            THE COURT:  Yes.







                                                                 248







 1            MR. JONES:  -- and I simply would take the opportunity



 2   to ask if the Court would think about that, about setting a



 3   schedule by which the matters would be presented to the Court



 4   in advocacy form through the appropriate written motions.



 5            THE COURT:  Well, it's not something that has escaped



 6   my attention that these things will be necessary, but I think



 7   this question of severance has an influence on those



 8   questions -- those issues.  Certainly.  But I will hear the --



 9   those matters in open court and in an adversarial procedure



10   because I'm sure there will be some disagreements.



11            All right.  9:00 in the morning.



12            (Recess at 4:44 p.m.)
