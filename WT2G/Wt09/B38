LASER SURGERY REMOVES TATTOOS, AGE SPOTS<P>

</CENTER></B><P>

Everyone has done something and then later regretted it.  In many instances, you can't change what was done.  Now, with a procedure at Dean Medical Center, if you've ever gotten a tattoo and later regretted it, you can have it removed without the sacrifice of scarring your skin.<P>

<P>

In the past, tattoos were removed by excision or with a carbon dioxide system that would burn through the skin and destroy all tissue in the laser's path.  Consequently, the patient's tattoo would be removed, but a scar was left behind.  The new system at Dean uses a laser beam that is selectively absorbed by the colors in the tattoo.  Because only the tattoo absorbs the laser's energy, there is minimal risk of scarring the skin.<P>

<P>

The laser, technically called a Q-Switched Neodymium:  YAG (Yttrium Aluminum Garnet) Laser, sends out very intense, brief bursts of light. The tattoo pigment then absorbs the light and is exploded into fragments.  Macrophage or scavenger cells carry away the fragments that are left from the tattoo.<P>

<P>

The laser uses two wavelengths, green or infrared, depending on the color of the tattoo.  Liver spots and other flat, brown lesions on the skin can also be removed using the YAG laser.<P>

<P>

Although the treatment uses very intense bursts of light, Dermatologist Robert McDonald, M.D., says most patients don't find it very painful.  &quot;The laser treatment feels like a snapping rubber band on your skin.  Some patients use an anesthetic ointment or a local anesthetic, while others tolerate the treatment without any anesthetic.&quot;<P>

<P>

Each treatment for tattoos last approximately 15 minutes, and depending on the depth and number of dyes used in the tattoo, Dermatologist Robert Glinert, M.D., says three to six treatments are needed.   &quot;The professional dyes are more stable so more treatments are needed to remove the tattoo.&quot;<P>

<P>

After treatment, there's bruising that lasts approximately one week.  To help heal the treated area, patients are encouraged to use an antibiotic ointment.  To allow the area to heal, Drs. Glinert and McDonald recommend separating treatments by six weeks.<P>

Using the YAG laser to remove tattoos is a new concept that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration just a month before Dean received the equipment.  In fact, Dean is the first medical center in Wisconsin to use this particular laser.<P>

<P>

The procedure truly is for anyone who wants to have a tattoo or brown spot removed from their skin.  &quot;I had a patient who was 65 and had the tattoo ever since he was in the military but decided to have it removed because his wife was tired of it,&quot; Dr. McDonald says.  Another patient, he says &quot;had the tattoo applied just two weeks before her first treatment.  Anyone can benefit.&quot;<P>

<P>

<I>
Cost for tattoo and lesion removal using the laser is approximately $300 per treatment, depending on size and is not routinely covered by insurance.</I>  <I>
For more information about tattoo or lesion removal, call Dean's Department of Dermatology, 608-252-8101.</I><P>

Second Thoughts About Your Tattoo?<P>

</B></I>A few days after Lori had two tattoos applied, she decided it wasn't something she wanted to have for the rest of her life.  &quot;It was tacky and I was embarrassed about it.  The artist was going to make it really small and it turned out so big.  I knew I wanted it removed,&quot; says Lori.<P>

<P>

Lori, who lives in Monroe, started calling all the medical facilities in the area.  &quot;I called everywhere and Dean was the only place that could remove the tattoo without scarring,&quot; she says.<P>

<P>

A few weeks later she had an appointment with Dean Dermatologist Dr. Robert McDonald to have her tattoos removed using the Q-Switched Neodymium: YAG Laser.  &quot;Dr. McDonald explained the whole procedure to me so there weren't any surprises,&quot; says Lori.<P>

<P>

The only thing Lori was surprised about was how quickly the tattoos were removed.  &quot;I thought it would take a lot more time.&quot;  Even with having two tattoos removed, each appointment was only about fifteen minutes.&quot;  Three treatments were enough to completely remove Lori's tattoos.<P>

<P>

&quot;I was really scared about the procedure before I went in, but after he started, it wasn't that bad.  By the last treatment, it didn't hurt al all.&quot;<P>

<P>

<B>
<I>
More Than Just Tattoo Removal<P>

</B></I>Susan went to her dermatologist appointment with hands that made her feel ten years older than her actual age.  When she left the clinic, her hands were on the way to looking ten years younger.<P>

<P>

Susan was one of Dermatologist Dr. Robert Glinert's first patients to have brown spots removed using the Q-Switched Neodymium: YAG Laser.  She says with only two treatments, her right hand is free of some of the biggest and darkest brown spots.<P>

<P>

Although Susan admits she was a bit nervous before her appointment, she says the anticipation was much worse than the actual procedure.  &quot;It was virtually painless.  When the laser touched my skin, it felt like a little pinch.  I'm sure it would have been more painful to have a shot to numb the area.&quot;<P>

<P>

Susan had two appointments that each lasted about ten minutes.  &quot;Those two appointments removed the worst of the brown spots on my right hand. <P>

Some day, I'd like to get all the spots on both my hands removed.&quot;<P>

<P>

&quot;I would recommend it to anybody.  It was painless and all I had to do was put salve on the small scabs that remained after the procedure.  I don't know why everyone wouldn't want to try it.  It's a really neat thing.&quot;<P>

<h2>Thyroid Disease</h2>
<B>
Running on empty<P>

</B>Leading the fast-paced lives most of us do, it's not uncommon to sometimes feel physically and mentally drained. But, for more than eight million Americans, that feeling may be the result of a treatable thyroid disease. Because the signs of an overactive or underactive thyroid gland are often unclear, more than half of the patients with the disorders don't even know they're ill. If not treated, however, thyroid diseases can have a substantial impact on the patient's health and lifestyle.<P>

<P>

<I>
The thyroid gland's role<P>

</I>Part of the endocrine system, which regulates the body's hormone production, the thyroid gland plays an essential role. Covering the windpipe, this butterfly-shaped gland produces thyroid hormones that contribute significantly to normal growth and metabolism. The most common conditions occur when the gland is underactive, producing too little thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism); or overactive, manufacturing too much hormone (hyperthyroidism).<P>

<P>

<I>
Hypothyroidism<P>

</I>Affecting six to seven million American men and women, hypothyroidism is most common in women, especially in their 50s and 60s.  According to Endocrinologist Paul Reber, D.O., the most common cause of the condition is Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This autoimmune disorder, for some unknown reason, identifies the thyroid gland as a foreign body.  Seeking to protect itself, the immune system launches an attack against the thyroid, producing antibodies that begin to destroy the gland.  Weakened, the thyroid begins producing less hormone, draining the patient's energy.<P>

<P>

Often mimicking signs of the natural aging process, or other medical conditions, Dr. Reber says hypothyroidism can be hard for patients to recognize. Symptoms they may experience include:
<ul type=disc>
<lh></lh>

<LI>
Fatigue

<LI>
Decreased memory and concentration

<LI>
Weight gain despite a decreased appetite Hoarse voice

<LI>
Dry skin, hair and brittle nails

<LI>
Constipation

<LI>
Irregular menstrual cycle -- more frequent, or longer, heavier periods Slowed heart rate

<LI>
Puffiness around the eyes

<LI>
Swelling in the ankles

<LI>
Intolerance to cold
</ul>
<P>

If left untreated, Dr. Reber says the primary consequence patients suffer is reduced quality of life.  &quot;Everything in the body just slows down,&quot; he says. &quot;Occasionally, in extremely rare cases, it can also lead to congestive heart problems, or even coma.&quot;<P>

The primary objective in treating hypothyroidism is to bring thyroid hormone up to the level of a normal, healthy gland.  To do this, patients are generally given a daily synthetic hormone medication called levothyroxine sodium. Because the pill is derived directly from human thyroid, Dr. Reber says there are usually no side affects. &quot;Once the correct dosage is established, it's just a matter of testing the blood once a year to ensure that the thyroid hormone level is normal,&quot; he says.<P>

<P>

<I>
Hyperthyroidism<P>

</I>Although hypothyroidism is far more prevalent, Dr. Reber explains that an overly active thyroid (hyperthyroidism) can have more serious health consequences.  If left untreated, it can lead to osteoporosis (the bone deteriorating disease, most common in women), and heart rhythm disturbances. <P>

<P>

Affecting almost one million Americans, hyperthyroidism is also most common in women, particularly in their 30s and 40s. Like Hashimoto's disease, hyperthyroidism can be an autoimmune disease. However, when this occurs in an overactive thyroid, the immune system's attack on the gland causes it to produce too much thyroid hormone. The most common form of this condition is Graves' disease, from which former First Lady Barbara Bush suffers.<P>

<P>

Common symptoms of hyperthyroidism include:
<ul type=disc>
<lh></lh>

<LI>
Mood swings/nervousness/irritability Fatigue

<LI>
Heart palpitations

<LI>
Weight loss despite an increase in appetite Increased perspiration

<LI>
Heat intolerance

<LI>
Frequent bowel movements

<LI>
Muscle weakness/tremors

<LI>
Mental disturbances

<LI>
Irregular menstrual periods

<LI>
Sleep disturbances

<LI>
Enlarged thyroid (goiter)

<LI>
Vision problems or eye irritation
</ul>
<P>

Treating an overactive thyroid is a complex process that requires long-term maintenance.  To reduce the amount of thyroid hormone the gland produces, patients are generally given the choice of antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy, or radioactive iodine treatment to reduce the gland's size and activity.  Very young patients with Grave's disease and older patients with diseased thyroid glands are often treated with thyroid surgery.<P>

<P>

<I>
Detecting an abnormal thyroid gland<P>

</I>Dr. Reber suggests that patients experiencing any symptoms or  having a family history for thyroid problems should be tested for thyroid disease.  A routine thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test, taken from a blood sample, indicates if thyroid hormones are being produced above or below normal levels.  Patients with other autoimmune diseases, like juvenile onset diabetes, should be screened regularly, since they are especially susceptible to thyroid imbalances and other autoimmune diseases.<P>

<P>

Dr. Reber cautions that the TSH test probably isn't necessary for everyone who feels fatigued.  &quot;Most people probably feel they could use more energy,&quot; he says. But if they have any of the symptoms, or a family history, a screening may be worthwhile.  &quot;In previous screenings with which I've been involved, about 10 percent of patients with even a few symptoms have had thyroid disease.&quot;<P>

<B>
A BURNING PROBLEM: ULCERS, HEARTBURN AND GASTRITIS<P>

</CENTER></B><P>

Many people have probably experienced it...a sharp pain underneath the breastbone wakes them up in the middle of the night.  Or maybe a burning sensation between meals is becoming annoying.  If it happens often enough, many people come to the conclusion that they have an ulcer.  But according to Dean Gastroenterologist John Hamilton, M.D., only 1-2 percent of Americans suffer from ulcers.  He says it's more likely these stomach problems are heartburn or gastritis (acid indigestion).<P>

<P>

According to Dr. Hamilton, since there is little symptomatic difference between acid indigestion and ulcers, physicians usually treat the stomach problem as acid indigestion with an antacid or a drug that lowers the acid content in the stomach.  &quot;If symptoms persist or reoccur we will schedule an upper GI or an endoscopy,&quot; says Dr. Hamilton.  An upper GI is where a patient swallows barium and then the stomach is x-rayed.  An endoscopy is a minimally-invasive procedure that uses an instrument with a small camera and a video monitor to view what is occurring in the internal organs.  &quot;The advantage of an endoscopy is you can actually see the lining and detect more subtle changes of gastritis and can also do biopsies in search of bacteria.&quot;<P>

<P>

Heartburn, the most common stomach ailment, occurs when acid in the stomach regurgitates into the esophagus due to the malfunction of a valve located between the stomach and esophagus.  Although Hamilton says heartburn isn't life-threatening, some people suffer from chronic heartburn.  &quot;It's very important for chronic sufferers to realize that weight loss, reduced alcohol consumption, and a lower-fat diet will help the valve work better,&quot; he says.<P>

<P>

Another common stomach ailment is acid indigestion.  Acid indigestion occurs when the heavy mucous lining of the stomach is broken down irritating the wall of the stomach.  Although it's believed by many people spicy foods eat away at the stomach's lining, Dr. Hamilton disagrees.  &quot;Spicy foods don't thin out the lining, but the lining is sensitive to those foods,&quot; he says.  The real culprits, he says, are aspirin and other over-the-counter analgesics/anti-inflammatories that thin out the stomach's protective layer.  Stress, alcohol and tobacco also add to the destruction of the lining.  However, Hamilton says, &quot;the grand majority of the acid indigestion problems we see is induced by other medications.&quot;<P>

<P>

&quot;If patients are able to stop using medications that contain aspirin, that's the first thing we suggest.  Unfortunately, there are many people that need to take pain relievers or aspirin for joint problems or heart conditions,&quot; says Dr. Hamilton.  If that's the case, a medication that can be used in conjunction with the pain reliever or aspirin is prescribed to relieve gastritis.<P>

<P>

Peptic ulcers-both gastric (stomach) and duodenal (small intestine)-occur when the lining of the stomach is broken down so far that acids eat a hole in the lining.  Although spicy foods and excess stomach acid triggered by stress have long been blamed for the problem, it's now being widely-researched that a bacteria, Helicobacter pylori, thriving in patients' stomachs may be causing the gastrological pain.  And if that's the case, an antibiotic could put an end to many people's ulcers.  In fact, a New England Journal of Medicine study found that 92 percent of patients with Helicobacter pylori were free of ulcers after using antibiotics.  A year later, only four of the 92 percent on antibiotics had a recurring ulcer.<P>

<P>

For anyone with symptomatic problems, Dr. Hamilton suggests trying over-the-counter medications like Mylanta, Maalox and Tums.  Be aware, however, that medications based in magnesium (anything beginning with the letter `m') can lead to diarrhea and those based in aluminum may be a little weak and could lead to constipation.  Calcium carbonates like Tums, he says, will probably only make you feel better temporarily.  If problems persist, see your personal physician.<P>

<h2>Breast Biopsy</h2>
<B>
Breast Biopsy Made Better<P>

</B>It's a scenario many women fear. Your routine mammogram shows an abnormality in your breast. Your physician tells you a biopsy is needed to find out if the abnormality is benign or malignant. A traditional surgical biopsy, although very accurate, requires an incision in the breast. Now, with the introduction of stereotactic-guided core biopsy, women whose mammogram reveals a suspicious abnormality have a new option.<P>

<P>

According to Radiologist Michael Cullenward, M.D., stereotactic-guided core biopsy is quicker, easier on the patient and costs less than traditional surgical biopsy. "This procedure is handled on an outpatient basis. There is no reason for the patient to go to the hospital and there is no general anesthesia required," he says. "But the most important thing, especially from the woman's point of view, is that the sample we obtain is reliable, giving women the answer they need."<P>

<P>

One of the reasons this new procedure is so attractive is because of the number of women having traditional surgical biopsies performed--one out of 50 mammograms show an abnormality that requires further examination. Of those that need biopsy, about 70 percent end up being benign. But Surgeon James Gutenberger, M.D., feels women have to go through too much to find out that result. "There's too much normal breast tissue being lost," says Dr. Gutenberger. "Using the new equipment, we remove very little tissue."<P>

<P>

The new equipment used is a stereotactic localization device that allows radiologists to view a mass spotted on a mammogram. "Digital X-rays are taken from two different angles, allowing exact identification of the area that requires a biopsy," says Dr. Cullenward. Multiple areas that need to be sampled are then plotted in three dimensions on a computer monitor. Using the computer, the radiologist then aligns the needle in the proper location in the woman's breast and tissue is extracted using an automated biopsy device.<P>

<P>

According to Dr. Cullenward, one of the biggest advantages of stereotactic biopsy over traditional surgical biopsy is the condition in which the breast is left. "When you have a surgical biopsy, the scarring that occurs changes future mammograms and makes them more difficult to interpret," he says. "Whenever the body heals itself, it never ends up looking like it did when it started." By using the stereotactic method, there is much less internal tissue damage, minimizing scarring in the breast and making future mammographic detection easier. And cosmetically, there's no significant scar formation on the skin. <P>

<P>

But that's not to say all biopsies will now be done using the stereotactic method. There are some abnormalities that are better handled with a surgical biopsy. "Stereotactic core biopsies are best used with women who have a mammographic abnormality that is more likely to be benign, but you want to confirm that assumption without going through a traditional surgical procedure," says Dr. Gutenberger.<P>

<P>

According to Surgical Nurse Teri Hetzel, R.N., women experience less discomfort following the stereotactic biopsy than women having the traditional breast biopsy procedure. "There have been a few women who have had both procedures and they've told me how much happier they are after the new procedure," says Hetzel. <P>

<P>

That shouldn't be surprising. Most women take off two days of work for surgical biopsy--one for the procedure itself and one for recovery. But with the stereotactic method, most women only need a few hours away from work. "I think the most discomfort I've heard about from patients undergoing stereotactic biopsy is having to lie in one place for an hour," she says. "We try to make them as comfortable as possible for that hour." In fact, during the procedure, that's Teri's sole responsibility--to concentrate on the needs of the patient.<P>

<P>

Dean Medical Center female patients aren't the only ones happy to see this new procedure available to them. Dr. Gutenberger is also pleased to be able to offer this new technique to the many women who require a closer look at suspicious breast tissue. "I'm very excited to be offering this new technology," he says. "From our end, it requires a lot of teamwork between the primary care physician, the radiologist and the surgeon. But, in the end, when you have good teamwork, the patient will profit."<P>

<h3><A name="a0">WHAT IS MENOPAUSE?</A></h3>
<blockquote>
<P>
<I> &quot;I wasn't sure what to expect with menopause,
although I certainly looked forward to not having my period any
more.  I have to admit, I'm concerned about how my body will change.
 My mother never talked about menopause.  She says her mother
never did either, probably because then it was linked to old age
and poor health.  Now, you hear about it all the time.  The 'baby
boom' generation is making menopause a big issue because of their
sheer numbers, and because they'll live with it much longer than
their grandmothers did.  Back then, menopause did come near the
end of life.  now I'm going through it, but I feel like I still
have my whole life ahead of me </I> .&quot;
<BR>
 
<P>
 More than one third of the women in the United States,
about 36 million, have been through menopause.  With a life expectancy
of about 81 years, a 50 year-old woman can expect to live more
than one-third of her life after menopause.  Scientific research
is just beginning to address some of the unanswered questions
about these years and about the poorly understood biology of menopause.
<BR>
 
<P>
 Menopause is the point in a woman's life when menstruation
stops permanently, signifying the end of her ability to have children.
 Known as the &quot;change of life,&quot; menopause is the last
stage of a gradual biological process in which the ovaries reduce
their production of female sex hormones -- a process which begins
about three to five years before the final menstrual period.
This transitional phase is called the climacteric, or perimenopause.
 Menopause is considered complete when a woman has been without
periods for one year.  On average, this occurs around age 50 but
like the beginning of menstruation in adolescence, timing varies
from person to person.  Cigarette smokers tend to reach menopause
earlier than non-smokers.<BR>
<BR>
 
<P>
<a name="a1">
<b><font size=2><FONT SIZE="+1">H</FONT>OW <FONT SIZE="+1">D</FONT>OES <FONT SIZE="+1">I</FONT>T <FONT SIZE="+1">H</FONT>APPEN<FONT SIZE="+1">?</FONT>
</b></font>
<br>
The ovaries contain structures
called follicles that hold the egg cells.  You are born with about
500,000 egg cells and by puberty there are about 75,000 left.
 Only about 400 to 500 ever mature fully to be released during
the menstrual cycle.  The rest degenerate over the years.  During
the reproductive years, a gland in the brain generates hormones
that cause a new egg to be released from its follicle each month.
 The follicle then produces the sex hormones estrogen and progesterone,
which thicken the lining of the uterus.  This enriched lining
is prepared to receive and nourish a fertilized egg which could
develop into a baby.  If fertilization does not occur, estrogen
and progesterone levels drop, the lining of the uterus breaks
down, and menstruation occurs.<BR>
 
<P>
 For unknown reasons, the ovaries begin to decline
in hormone production during the mid-thirties.  In the late forties,
the process accelerates and hormones fluctuate more, causing irregular
menstrual cycles and unpredictable episodes of heavy bleeding.
 By the early to mid-fifties, periods finally end altogether.
 However, estrogen production does not completely stop.  The ovaries
decrease their output significantly, but still may produce a small
amount.  Also, some estrogen is produced in fat cells with help
from the adrenal glands (near the kidney).<BR>
 
<P>
 Progesterone, the other female hormone, works during
the second half of the menstrual cycle to create a lining in the
uterus as a viable home for an egg, and to shed the lining if
the egg is not fertilized.  If you skip a period, your body may
not be making enough progesterone to break down the uterine lining.
 However, your estrogen levels may remain high even though you
are not menstruating.<BR>
 
<P>
 At menopause, hormone levels don't always decline
uniformly.  They alternately rise and fall again.  Changing ovarian
hormone levels affect the other glands in the body, which together
make up the endocrine system.  The endocrine system controls growth,
metabolism and reproduction.  This system must constantly readjust
itself to work effectively.  Ovarian hormones also affect all
other tissues, including the breasts, vagina, bones, blood vessels,
gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, and skin.<BR>
<BR>

<br>
Premenopausal women who
have both their ovaries removed surgically experience an abrupt
menopause.  They may be hit harder by menopausal symptoms than
are those who experience it naturally.  Their hot flashes may
be more severe, more frequent, and last longer.  They may have
a greater risk of heart disease and osteoporosis.  When only one
ovary is removed, menopause usually occurs naturally.  When the
uterus is removed (hysterectomy) and the ovaries remain, menstrual
periods stop but other menopausal symptoms (if any) usually occur
at the same age that they would naturally.  However, some women
who have a hysterectomy may experience menopausal symptoms at
a younger age, possibly due to a decreased blood supply to the
ovaries as a result of surgery.<BR>
 
<P>
<I> &quot;I had hot flashes, but they were fairly
mild.  Sometimes at night I'd suddenly start to sweat and have
to throw all the covers off.  But they never lasted long and I
could usually get right back to sleep.  During the day, I noticed
they tended to come whenever I had a big decision to make or when
I felt a little tense.  But they only lasted about two years.
 I feel blessed.  I've had no other problems.&quot;<BR>

<h3>WHAT TO EXPECT</h3>
<blockquote>
 Menopause is an individualized experience.  Some
women notice little difference in their bodies or moods, while
others find the change extremely bothersome and disruptive.  Estrogen
and progesterone affect virtually all tissues in the body, but
everyone is influenced by them differently.<BR>
<BR>
<a name="b1">
<font size=2><B><FONT SIZE="+1">H</FONT>OT <FONT SIZE="+1">F</FONT>LASHES</B></font>
<br>
Hot flashes, or flushes,
are the most common symptoms of menopause, affecting more than
60% of menopausal women in the United States.  A hot flash is
a sudden sensation of intense heat in the upper part or all of
the body.  The face and neck may become flushed, with red blotches
appearing on the chests, back, and arms.  This is often followed
by profuse sweating and then cold shivering as body temperature
readjusts.  A hot flash can last a few moments or 30 minutes or
longer.<BR>
 
<P>
 Hot flashes occur sporadically and often start several
years before other signs of menopause.  They gradually decline
in frequency and intensity as you age.  Eighty percent of all
women with hot flashes have them for 2 years or less, while a
small percentage have them for more than 5 years.  Hot flashes
can happen at any time.  They can be as mild as a light blush,
or severe enough to wake you from a deep sleep.  Some women even
develop insomnia.  Others have experienced that caffeine, alcohol,
hot drinks, spice foods, and stressful or frightening events can
sometimes trigger a hot flash.  However, avoiding these triggers
will not necessarily prevent all episodes.<BR>
 
<P>
 Hot flashes appear to be a direct result of decreasing
estrogen levels.  If there is no estrogen, your glands release
other hormones that dilate blood vessels and destabilize body
temperature.  Hormone therapy relieves the discomfort of hot flashes
in most cases.  Some women claim that vitamin E offers minor relief,
although there has never been a study to confirm it.  Aside from
hormone therapy, which is not for everyone, here are some suggestions
for coping with hot flashes:<BR>
 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Dress in layers so you can remove them at the first sign of a flash.</LI>
<LI>Drink a glass of cold water or juice at the onset of a flash.</LI>
<LI>At night, keep a thermos of ice water or an ice pack by your bed.</LI>
<LI>Use cotton sheets, lingerie and clothing to let your skin &quot;breathe&quot;.</LI>
</UL>

<br>
 With advancing age, the walls of the vagina become
thinner, dryer, less elastic and more vulnerable to infection.
 These changes can make sexual intercourse uncomfortable or painful.
 Most women find it helpful to lubricate the vagina.  Water-soluble
lubricants are preferable, as they help reduce the chance of infection.
 Try to avoid petroleum jelly; many women are allergic, and it
damages condoms.  Be sure to see your gynecologist if problems
persist.<BR>
 
<P>
 Tissues in the urinary tract also change with age,
sometimes leaving women more susceptible to involuntary loss of
urine (incontinence), particularly if certain chronic illnesses
or urinary infections are also present.  Exercise, coughing, laughing,
lifting heavy objects or similar movements that put pressure on
the bladder may cause small amounts of urine to leak.  Lack of
regular physical exercise may contribute to this condition.  It
is important to know, however, that incontinence is not a normal
part of aging, to be masked by using adult diapers.  Rather, it
is usually a treatable condition that warrants medical evaluation.
<BR>
 
<P>
 Within four or five years after the final menstrual
period, there is an increased chance of vaginal and urinary tract
infections.  If symptoms such as painful or overly frequent urination
occur, consult your physician.  Infections are easily treated
with antibiotics, but often tend to recur.  To help prevent these
infections, urinate before and after intercourse, be sure your
bladder is not full for long periods, drink plenty of fluids,
and keep your genital area clean.  Douching is not thought to
be effective in preventing infection.<BR>

<br>
 A popular myth pictures the menopausal woman shifting
from raging, angry moods into depressive, doleful slumps with
no apparent reason or warning.  However, a study by psychologists
at the University of Pittsburgh suggests that menopause does not
cause unpredictable mood swings, depression, or even stress in
most women.<BR>
 
<P>
 In fact, it may even improve mental health for some.
 This gives further support to the idea that menopause is not
necessarily a negative experience.  The Pittsburgh study looked
at three different groups of women:  menstruating, menopausal
with no treatment, and menopausal on hormone therapy.  The study
showed that the menopausal women suffered no more anxiety, depression,
anger, nervousness or feelings of stress than the group of menstruating
women in the same age range.<BR>
 
<P>
 The Pittsburgh findings are supported by a New England
Research Institute study which found that menopausal women were
no more depressed than the general population:  about 10% are
occasionally depressed and 5% are persistently depressed.<BR>
 
<P>
 Studies also have indicated that many cases of depression
relate more to life stresses or &quot;mid-life crises&quot; than
to menopause.  Such stresses include:  an alteration in family
roles, as when your children are grown and move out of the house,
no longer &quot;needing&quot; mom; a changing social support network,
which may happen after a divorce if you no longer socialize with
friends you met through your husband; interpersonal losses, as
when a parent, spouse or other close relative dies; and your own
aging and the beginning of physical illness.  People have very
different responses to stress and crisis.  Your best friend's
response may be negative, leaving her open to emotional distress
and depression, while yours is positive, resulting in achievement
of your goals.  For many women, this stage of life can actually
be a period of enormous freedom.<BR>
<BR>

<br>
 For some women, but by no means all, menopause brings
a decrease in sexual activity.  Reduced hormone levels cause subtle
changes in the genital tissues and are thought to be linked also
to a decline in sexual interest.  Lower estrogen levels decrease
the blood supply to the vagina and the nerves and glands surrounding
it.  This makes delicate tissues thinner, drier, and less able
to produce secretions to comfortably lubricate before and during
intercourse.  Avoiding sex is not necessary, however, estrogen
creams and oral estrogen can restore secretions and tissue elasticity.
 Water-soluble lubricants can also help.<BR>
 
<P>
 While changes in hormone production are cited as
the major reason for changes in sexual behavior, many other interpersonal,
psychological, and cultural factors can come into play.  For instance,
a Swedish study found that many women use menopause as an excuse
to stop sex completely after years of disinterest.  Many physicians,
however, question if declining interest is the cause or the result
of less frequent intercourse.<BR>
 
<P>
 Some women actually feel liberated after menopause
and report an increased interest in sex.  They feel relieved that
the children are out of the house and pregnancy is no longer a
worry.<BR>
 
<P>
 For women in perimenopause, birth control is a confusing
issue.  Physicians advise all women who have menstruated, even
if irregularly, within the past year to continue using birth control.
 Unfortunately, contraceptive options are limited.  Hormone-based
oral and implantable contraceptives are risky in older women who
smoke.  However, these methods are not contraindicated in non-smokers.
 Only a few brands of IUDs are on the market.  The other options
are barrier methods -- diaphragms, condoms, and sponges -- or
methods requiring surgery such as tubal ligation for women, and
vasectomy for the male partner.<BR>
<BR>

<br>
 Some men go through their own set of doubts in middle
age.  They too, often report a decline in sexual activity after
age 50.  It may take more time to reach ejaculation, or they may
not be able to reach it at all.  Many fear they will fail sexually
as they get older.  Remember, at any age sexual problems can arise
if there are doubts about performance.  If both partners are well
informed about normal genital changes, each can be more understanding
and make allowances rather than unmeetable demands.  Open, candid
communication between partners is important to ensure a successful
sex life well into your seventies and eighties.<BR>
 
<P>
 For most women, natural menopause is not a major
crisis and does not influence their opinion of their general health. 
<P>
<I> &quot;In a society that places so much value on
youth and beauty, it's not much fun to think about menopause.
 But when you get there, you find it doesn't really make that
much difference; you concentrate on how you feel about yourself,
not on how you think others see you.  I continue trying to improve
myself, to keep learning and keep active.  It's not your age that
counts, it's how you handle it.&quot;<BR>

<h3>LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF ESTROGEN DEFICIENCY</h3>
<blockquote>
<P>
<a name="c1">
<font size=2><B><FONT SIZE="+1">O</FONT>STEOPOROSIS </B></font>
<br>
 One of the most important health issues for middle-aged
women is the threat of osteoporosis. It is a condition in which
bones become thin, fragile, and highly prone to fracture.  Numerous
studies over the past 10 years have linked estrogen insufficiency
to this gradual, yet debilitating disease.  In fact, osteoporosis
is more closely related to menopause than to a woman's chronological
age.<BR>
 
<P>
 Bones are not inert.  They are made up of healthy,
living tissue which continuously performs two processes:  breakdown
and formation of new bone tissue.  The two are closely linked.
 If breakdown exceeds formation, bone tissue is lost and bones
become thin and brittle.  Gradually and without discomfort, bone
loss leads to a weakened skeleton incapable of supporting normal
daily activities.<BR>
 
<P>
 Each year about 500,000 American women all fracture
a vertebrae, the bones that make up the spine, and about 300,000
will fracture a hip.  Nationwide, treatment for osteoporotic fractures
costs up to $10 billion per year, with hip fractures the most
expensive.  Vertebral fractures lead to curvature of the spine,
loss of height, and pain.  A severe hip fracture is painful and
recovery may involve a long period of bed rest.  Between 12 and
20 percent of those who suffer a hip fracture do not survive the
six months after the fracture.  At least half of those who do
survive require help in performing daily living activities, and
15 to 25 percent will need to enter a long-term care facility.
 Older patients are rarely given the chance for full rehabilitation
after a fall.  However, with adequate time and care provided in
rehabilitation, many people can regain their independence and
return to their previous activities.<BR>
 
<P>
 For osteoporosis, researchers believe that an &quot;ounce
of prevention is worth a pound of cure&quot;.  The condition of
an older woman's skeleton depends on two things:  the peak amount
of bone attained before menopause and the rate of the bone loss
thereafter.  Hereditary factors are important in determining peak
bone mass.  For instance, studies show that black women attain
a greater spinal mass and therefore have fewer osteoporotic fractures
than white women.  Other factors that help increase bone mass
include adequate intake of dietary calcium and vitamin D, exposure
to sunlight, and physical exercise.  These elements also help
slow the rate of bone loss.  Certain other physiological stresses
can quicken bone loss, such as pregnancy, nursing, and immobility.
 The biggest culprit in the process of bone loss is estrogen deficiency.
 Bone loss quickens during perimenopause, the transitional phase
when estrogen levels drop significantly.<BR>
 
<P>
 Physicians believe the best strategy for osteoporosis
is prevention.  Building up your reserves of bone before you start
to lose it during periomenopause helps bank against future losses.
 The most effective therapy against osteoporosis available today
for postmenopausal women is estrogen.  Remarkably, estrogen saves
more bone tissue than even very large daily doses of calcium.
 Estrogen is not a panacea, however, while it is a boon for the
bones, its impact on the other areas of the body must be considered.

 Most people picture an older, overweight man when
they think of a likely candidate for cardiovascular disease (CVD).
 But men are only half the story.  Heart disease is the number
one killer of American women and is responsible for half of all
the deaths of women over the age of 50.  Ironically, in past years,
women were rarely included in clinical heart studies, but finally
physicians have realized that it is as much a woman's disease
as a man's.<BR>
 
<P>
 CVDs are disorders of the heart and circulatory system.
 They include thickening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) that
serve the heart and limbs, high blood pressure, angina, and stroke.
 For reasons unknown, estrogen helps protect women against CVD
during the childbearing years.  This is true even when they have
the same risk factors as men, including smoking, high blood cholesterol
levels, and a family history of heart disease.  But the protection
is temporary.  After menopause, the incidence of CVD increases,
with each passing year posing a greater risk.  The good news,
though, is that CVD can be prevented or at least reduced by early
recognition, life style changes and, many physicians believe,
hormone replacement therapy.<BR>
 
<P>
 Menopause brings changes in the level of fats in
a woman's blood.  These fats, called lipids, are used as a source
of fuel for all cells.  The amount of lipids per unit of blood
determines a person's cholesterol count.  There are two components
of cholesterol:  high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, which
is associated with a beneficial, cleansing effect in the bloodstream,
and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which encourages
fat to accumulate on the walls of arteries and eventually clog
them.  To remember the difference, think of the &quot;H&quot;
in HDL as the healthy cholesterol, and the &quot;L&quot; in LDL
as lethal.  LDL cholesterol appears to increase while HDL decreases
in postmenopausal women as a direct result of estrogen deficiency.
 Elevated LDL and total cholesterol can lead to stroke, heart
attack, and death.<BR>

<br>
 To combat the symptoms associated with falling estrogen
levels, physicians have turned to hormone replacement therapy
(HRT).  HRT is the administration of the female hormones estrogen
and progesterone.  Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) refers to
administration of estrogen alone.  The hormones are usually given
in pill form, or skin patches, though sometimes vaginal creams
(just estrogen) are used.  ERT is thought to help prevent the
devastating effects of heart disease and osteoporosis, conditions
that are often difficult and expensive to treat once they appear.
 There is not enough existing data for physicians to suggest that
HRT is the right choice for all women.  Several large studies
are currently attempting to resolve the questions, though it will
take several more years to reach any definitive answers.<BR>
 
<P>
 In the 1940s when estrogen was first offered to menopausal
women, it was given alone and in high doses.  Today, after 50
years of trial and error, it is well known that estrogen stimulates
growth of the inner lining of the uterus (endometrium) that sheds
during menstruation.  This growth may continue uncontrollably,
resulting in cancer.  Today, physicians typically prescribe a
lower dose of estrogen, in combination with synthetic progesterone,
to counteract estrogen's effect on the uterus.  Progestin reduces
the risk of cancer by causing monthly shedding of the endometrium.
 The obvious drawback to this approach is that menopausal women
resume monthly bleeding.  Once menopause arrives, most women enjoy
the freedom of life without a period.  Many are reluctant to begin
their cycles again.  In addition, there are other unpleasant side
effects of progestin which often discourage women from continuing
HRT.  These include breast tenderness, bloating, abdominal cramping,
anxiety, irritability, and depression.  By giving smaller doses
of progestin daily in combination with estrogen most of these
side effects including bleeding can be eliminated.<BR>

 Estrogen therapy is the most successful method of
combating osteoporosis.  As previously discussed, estrogen halts
bone loss but cannot necessarily rebuild bone.  Long-term estrogen
use (10 or more years) may be required to prevent postmenopausal
bone loss.  Why estrogen helps protect the skeleton is still unclear.
 We do know that estrogen helps bones absorb the calcium they
need to stay strong.  It also helps conserve the calcium stored
in the bones by encouraging other cells to use dietary calcium
more efficiently.  For instance, muscles require calcium to contract.
 If there is not enough calcium circulating in the blood for muscles
to use, calcium is &quot;borrowed&quot; from the bone.  Calcium
is also needed for blood clotting, sending nerve impulses, and
secreting various hormones.  Prolonged borrowing from bone calcium
for these processes speeds bone loss.  That's why it's important
to consume adequate amounts of calcium in your diet.<BR>
<BR>

<br>
 The majority of past clinical studies have shown
that women who take estrogen substantially reduce their risk of
developing and dying from heart disease.  One or two studies demonstrate
conflicting evidence, but they are far outnumbered by the positive
reports.  Results from a recent study showed that after 15 years
of estrogen replacement, risk of death by CVD was reduced by almost
50% and overall deaths were reduced by 40%.  Some researchers
credit this reduction to oral estrogen's ability to maintain HDL
and LDL at their healthier, premenopausal levels, through its
interaction with proteins in the liver.  Others believe it is
estrogen's direct effect on the blood vessels themselves (through
receptors on the vessel walls) which creates this benefit.  In
the latter case, both oral estrogen and the skin patch would be
effective.  Studies are underway to determine which mechanism
contributes most to a healthy heart.<BR>
 
<P>
 Clearly, estrogen appears to benefit women at high
risk for heart disease.  The high risk group includes women with
a strong family history of CVD, those with high blood pressure,
smokers, and obese women.  One study observed fewer cardiovascular
deaths among estrogen users compared to non-users.  Women whose
ovaries had been surgically removed had the greatest reduction
of risk.  The same study also confirmed, as expected, the link
between smoking, obesity and cardiovascular disease.<BR>
 
<P>
 At any time of life, women who smoke are much more
likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke than women who
do not smoke, but after menopause, a smoker's risk climbs dramatically.
 Low estrogen levels and smoking are separate risk factors for
CVD.  When the two are combined, the risk is much higher than
either one alone.  Smoking also raises your risks for some types
of cancer and for chronic lung disease, such as emphysema.  Fortunately,
quitting smoking -- at any age -- can cut the risk of disease
almost immediately.  Studies have shown that when older people
quit, they increase their life expectancy.  Their risk of heart
disease goes down, their lungs function better, and blood circulation
improves.  So quitting smoking, whether before, during or after
menopause, can have a definite impact on both the length and quality
of your life.<BR>
 
<P>
 Should women be treated with a drug to prevent a
disease they might never get (osteoporosis, heart disease)?  Some
people will be placed at higher risk, while others will benefit.
 Each woman should make a decision about HRT based on her own
family history and life experiences.<BR>
 
<P>
<I> &quot;To me, exercise is the key to staying healthy.
 Some of these ladies have been coming to this class for ten years.
 I think that really says a lot.  Do you think they'd get up at
7:00 a.m. to jump around if it didn't make them feel better?&quot;
<BR>
 </I>
<P>
 Many women who have quit smoking say they found support
in group counseling sessions.  Local chapters of the American
Cancer Society and the American Heart Association are good places
to start looking for a smoking cessation group.  Nicotine gum
and nicotine patches prescribed by a physician may also help.
<BR>
 
<P>
 While we know that HRT users have a decreased risk
of CVD, it is not clear how or if women with preexisting heart
disease can benefit.  Because uncertainty exists, some of these
women may be advised by their physicians not to take estrogen.
 Researchers hope to further investigate non-hormonal methods
of preventing heart disease such as weight reduction or control,
exercise, smoking cessation, and dietary modification.  According
to a 5-year study reported in 1988, weight gain (a common occurrence
among many menopausal women) significantly raises blood pressure,
total and LDL cholesterol, and fat levels.  Together, these make
up a dangerous recipe for heart disease.  Several other studies
also noted that moderate alcohol consumption, about one drink
per day, had a protective effect on the heart.  Physicians advise
caution in this area, however, as excess alcohol can increase
risks for other serious problems such as brain hemorrhaging, liver
disease, and certain types of cancer.<BR>
 
<P>
 While cardiovascular benefits associated with oral
estrogen are fairly well-known, there is surprisingly little information
on the cardiovascular effects of progestin combined with estrogen.
 Some studies suggest that progestins counteract the favorable
HDL and LDL effects achieved by estrogen alone, while other studies
show no such effect.  This remains just one more gray area where
questions outnumber reliable answers.<BR>

 As discussed previously, there is evidence that in
women with an intact uterus, estrogen may provoke growth of the
tissues lining the uterus and increase the risk of uterine cancer.
 Also of great concern is the influence of estrogen on breast
cancer.  Researchers believe that the longer your lifetime exposure
to naturally occurring estrogen, the greater your risk of breast
cancer.  It has not been proven, however that estrogen administered
at menopause has the same effect.  There is disagreement on the
many trials conducted to date because of wide variations in the
populations studied and the doses, timing, and types of estrogen
used.  A recent analysis of previous studies suggests that low-dose
estrogen taken on a short-term basis (10 years or less) does not
pose an increased risk of breast cancer.  Long-term use (more
than 10 years) at a high dose may significantly increase the risk.
 By how much is still a matter of heated debate.  At the very
most, researchers think long-term use could possibly increase
the risk of getting breast cancer by 30%.  This means that incidence
would rise from 10 women per 10,000 each year to 13 women per
10,000 each year.  To reach any consensus, however, more women
need to be monitored for an extended period of time.  The fear
of cancer is one of the most common reasons that women are unwilling
to use HRT.  Interestingly, actual death rates for breast cancer
have not risen at all.  This is probably because estrogen users
have more frequent medical visits and obtain more preventive care
including yearly mammograms.<BR>
 
<P>
 While no one can determine who will eventually develop
breast cancer, there are certain risk factors you should be aware
of when considering HRT.  A family history of breast cancer (sister
or mother) is probably the most important risk factor of all.
 You may also be at an increased risk if:  you menstruated before
age 12; delayed motherhood until later in life; have a late menopause
(after age 50).  Also, the older you are, the higher the risk.
 Most physicians believe that if you are not in a high risk category
for breast or endometrial cancer, the benefits of HRT far outweigh
the risks.  However, for some women, the side effects of therapy
make it impossible to use.  This is a personal decision to be
made by each woman with help from her physician.<BR>
 
<P>
 Research shows that most women are concerned more
with quality of life than quantity of life.  They give higher
priority to the short-term effects of hormone therapy (relief
from hot flashes and vaginal dryness) than to long-term concerns
(preventing osteoporosis).<BR>

 Physicians usually caution women not to use HRT if

you in this category.<BR>

<h3>KEEPING HEALTHY</h3>
 </B>
<blockquote>
<P>
Good nutrition and regular
physical exercise are thought to improve overall health.  Some
physicians feel these factors can also affect menopause.  Although
these areas have not been well studied in women, anecdotal evidence
is strongly in favor of eating well and exercising to help lower
risks for CVD and osteoporosis.<BR>
<BR>
 
<P>
<a name="e1">
<font size=2><B><FONT SIZE="+1">N</FONT>UTRITION</B></font>
<br>
 While everyone agrees that a well-balanced diet is
important for good health, there is still much to be learned about
what constitutes &quot;well-balanced&quot;.  We do know that variety
in the diet helps ensure a better mix of essential nutrients.
<BR>
 
<P>
 Nutritional requirements vary from person to person
and change with age.  For instance, the Recommended Dietary Allowance
(RDA) for calcium as determined by the National Research Council
is 800 mgs per day for a healthy man.  A healthy premenopausal
woman should have more, about 1,000 to 1,200 mgs per day.  The
Council suggests that a postmenopausal woman consume 1,200 to
1,500 mgs per day to help avoid bone loss.  Foods high in calcium
include milk, yogurt, cheese and other dairy products; oysters,
sardines and canned salmon with bones; and dark-green leafy vegetables
like spinach and broccoli.  If you are lactose intolerant, acidophilus
milk is more digestible.  Vitamin D is also very important for
calcium absorption and bone formation.  A 1992 study showed that
women with postmenopausal osteoporosis who took vitamin D for
three years significantly reduced the occurrence of new spinal
fractures.  However, the issue is still controversial.  High doses
of vitamin D can cause kidney stones, constipation, or abdominal
pain, particularly in women with existing kidney problems.  Other
nutritional guidelines by the National Research Council include:
<BR>
 
<P>
<ul>
<li>Choose
foods low in fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol.  Fats contain
more calories (9 calories per gram) than either carbohydrates
or protein (each have only 4 calories per gram).  Fat intake should
be less than 30 percent of daily calories.<BR>
 
<P>
<li>Eat
fruits, vegetables, and whole grain cereal products, especially
those high in vitamin C and carotene.  These include oranges,
grapefruit, carrots, winter squash, tomatoes, broccoli, cauliflower,
and green leafy vegetables.  These foods are good sources of vitamins
and minerals and the major sources of dietary fiber.  Fiber helps
maintain bowel mobility and may reduce the risk of colon cancer.
 Young and older people alike are encouraged to consume 20 to
30 grams of fiber per day.<BR>
 
<P>
<li>Eat
very little salt-cured and smoked foods such as sausages, smoked
fish and ham, bacon, bologna, and hot dogs.  High blood pressure,
which may become more serious with heavy salt intake, is more
of a risk as you age.<BR>
 
<P>
<li>Avoid
food and drinks containing processed sugar.  Sugar contains empty
calories which may substitute for nutritious food and can add
excess body weight.<BR>
</ul>
<P>
 For people who can't eat an adequate diet, supplements
may be necessary.  A dietitian should tailor these to meet your
individual nutritional needs.  Using supplements without supervision
can be risky because large doses of some vitamins may have serious
side effects.  Vitamins A and D in large doses can be particularly
dangerous.<BR>
 
<P>
 As you age, your body requires less energy because
of a decline in physical activity and a loss of lean body mass.
 Raising your activity level will increase your need for energy
and help you avoid gaining weight.  Weight gain often occurs in
menopausal women, possibly due in part to declining estrogen.
 In animal studies, scientists found that estrogen is important
in regulating weight gain.  Animals with their ovaries surgically
removed gained weight, even if they were fed the same diet as
the animals with intact ovaries.  They also found that progesterone
counteracts the effect of estrogen.  The higher their progesterone
levels, the more the animals ate.<BR>
 
<P>
<a name="e2">
<font size=2><B><FONT SIZE="+1">E</FONT>XERCISE</B></font>
<br>
 Exercise is extremely important throughout a woman's
lifetime and particularly as she gets older.  Regular exercise
benefits the heart and bones, helps regulate weight, and contributes
to a sense of overall well-being and improvement in mood.  If
you are physically inactive you are far more prone to coronary
heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, and osteoporosis.
 Sedentary women may also suffer more from chronic back pain,
stiffness, and insomnia.  They often have poor circulation, weak
muscles, shortness of breath, and loss of bone mass.  Depression
can also be a problem.  Women who regularly walk, jog, swim, bike,
dance, or perform some other aerobic activity can more easily
circumvent these problems and also achieve higher HDL cholesterol
levels.  Studies show that women performing aerobic activity or
muscle-strength training reduced mortality from CVD and cancer.
<BR>
 
<P>
 Just like muscles, bones adhere to the &quot;use
it or lose it&quot; rule; they diminish in size and strength with
disuse.  It has been known for more than 100 years that weight-bearing
exercise (walking, running) will help increase bone mass.  Exercise
stimulates the cells responsible for generating new bone to work
overtime.  In the past 20 years, studies have shown that bone
tissue lost from lack of use can be rebuilt with weight-bearing
activity.  Studies of athletes show they have greater bone mass
compared to non-athletes at the sites related to their sport.
 In postmenopausal women, moderate exercise preserves bone mass
in the spine helping reduce the risk of fractures.<BR>
 
<P>
 Exercise is also thought to have a positive effect
on mood.  During exercise, hormones called endorphins are released
in the brain.  They are 'feel good' hormones involved in the body's
positive response to stress.  The mood-heightening effect can
last for several hours, according to some endocrinologists.  Consult
your physician before starting a rigorous exercise program.  She
or he will help you decide which types of exercises are best for
you.  An exercise program should start slowly and build up to
more strenuous activities.  Women who already have osteoporosis
of the spine should be careful about exercise that jolts or puts
weight on the back, as it could cause a fracture.<BR>

<h3>ONGOING/FUTURE RESEARCH </h3>
<blockquote>
<P>
 To gather more data to help women make a well-informed
decision regarding hormone therapy, researchers at the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin
Interventions Trial (PEPI) in 1989.  With 127 women enrolled at
each of seven medical centers, PEPI will address the short-term
safety and efficacy of various methods of HRT.  The study will
compare women who take estrogen by itself to those who take it
with different types of progestin.  It will also examine the effects
of both cyclical and continuous progestin on cardiovascular risk
factors, blood clotting factors, metabolism, uterine changes,
bone mass, and general quality of life.<BR>
 
<P>
 To date most large-scale studies have not fully reported
on normal body changes as women move from pre- to post-menopause.
 This lack of data has been one problem in assessing the value
of HRT.  Without knowing what &quot;normal&quot; is, scientists
have difficulty judging the effect of a particular treatment.
 Another problem with past studies is the &quot;healthy user effect.&quot;
 In many trials preceding PEPI, the HRT users studied had freely
chosen to begin treatment, with advice from their physicians.
 In general, most physicians discourage women with a preexisting
illness or long family history of breast cancer from taking HRT.
 This factor could skew study results to appear that nonusers
became ill or died more frequently simply because they failed
to take estrogen.  Only by randomly assigning study participants
to the treatment can this bias be overcome.<BR>
 
<P>
 Another NIH study begun in 1992, is the Women's Health
Initiative, a multicenter trial involving 70,000 postmenopausal
women ages 50 to 79.  The study will assess the long-term benefits
and risk of hormone therapy as it relates to cardiovascular disease,
osteoporosis, and breast and uterine cancer.  It will also help
determine the effects of calcium supplementation, dietary changes,
and exercise on women in this age group.  Some of the specific
questions to be addressed by the Women's Health Initiative include: 
<P>
<ol>
<li> How long is estrogen effective for each system
of the body (skeletal, cardiovascular, nervous, endocrine)?<BR>
<li> What is the best dose and route of administration of estrogen
and progestin to prevent side effects yet maintain efficacy?<BR>
<li> How long is estrogen safe to take?<BR>
<li> Does estrogen act the same way in older women as in younger
women?<BR>
<li> Are there effective alternatives to HRT? 
</ol>
<P>
 Clearly, no one has all the answers about menopause.
 Medical research is beginning to give us more accurate information,
but some myths and negative attitudes persist.  Women are challenging
old stereotypes, learning about what is happening in their bodies,
and taking responsibility for their health.  <BR>

<h2>Urinary Stress Incontinence</h2>
<B>
Minimally Invasive Surgery Ends Urinary Stress Incontinence<P>

</B>Women have been living with urinary stress incontinence for years. It's an embarrassing problem that can keep women from aerobics,  jogging or just walking for long periods of time. Some women are afraid to even laugh for fear it will cause leakage. But with the introduction of a laparoscopic version of the traditional surgical alternative, more women are talking about their incontinence and ways to stop the problem. <P>

<P>

According to Gynecologist Joseph Fok, M.D., the laparoscopic method of bladder neck suspension not only corrects the problem with as much success as the traditional more-invasive procedure, but requires a shorter hospital stay, allows for a quicker recover and causes less post-operative pain. "It really is the best of both worlds," says Dr. Fok. "You get the surgery with the highest success rate with less time in the hospital and less time for recovery."<P>

<P>

For many women, the problem with urinary stress incontinence occurs as a result of childbearing. While carrying a baby, the pelvic tissue stretches, weakening the pelvic floor that supports the bladder. The bladder, in turn, is unable to control urination, causing women to leak urine when sneezing, laughing, coughing or exercising. <P>

<P>

"It comes to a point where the incontinence starts to control your life," says Dr. Fok. "I've seen women who don't want to even go out for a walk because they're afraid it will cause leaking." <P>

<P>

To correct the problem, a laparoscope (a flexible tube linked to a miniaturized video camera) is inserted into the patient's abdominal area. The camera allows a view of the internal organs. The view of the internal organs is projected onto a video screen. By viewing the procedure on the screen, and with the help of other special surgical tools, the surgeons (it's a two-surgeon procedure) are able to suture the bladder neck to ligaments of the pubic bone, suspending it off the bladder floor. All this is done with just a few tiny incisions, instead of the larger incisions of the traditional procedure. <P>

<P>

Although laparoscopic bladder neck suspension is very successful, Dr. Fok says the surgery is not for everyone. "We aren't promoting this for every woman who has incontinence," he says. "Before we'll recommend surgery, we want to be sure that the incontinence is inhibiting a patient's lifestyle." He'll also encourage the patient to try other alternatives, like pelvic exercise and medication, before moving ahead with surgery.<P>

<P>

But if it appears the problem is severe enough and alternatives aren't successful, women undergoing laparoscopic bladder neck suspension can usually be up and walking a day after surgery and back to normal activity in a couple weeks. And with the chance of embarrassing leakage gone, "normal activity" could have a whole new definition--including things like running, aerobics and lots of laughing. <P>

<P>

<I>
Alternatives to Surgery<P>

</I>Although laparoscopic surgery for incontinence is about 95 percent effective, there are other alternatives to try before heading to surgery. Using biofeedback, patients at Physical and Rehab Therapy in Janesville (an Affiliate of Riverview Clinic), are able to see on a monitor when their pelvic floor muscles are relaxed or contracted. It literally trains patients to think about the use of the specific muscles that control urination.<P>

<P>

"You can flex your bicep and see and feel the reaction but the pelvic floor muscles are very difficult to explain or show," says Val Craig, Physical Therapy Assistant. "Through biofeedback, we're able to provide a visual example of muscle activity."<P>

<P>

In addition to the use of biofeedback, Craig teaches Kegel exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. These exercises are also a popular treatment for pregnant women who are suffering from incontinence due to pressure on the bladder. <P>

<P>

Ironically, Craig also uses biofeedback and the exercises to train the pelvic floor muscles to relax. "There are times when women can't relax enough to go to the bathroom, keeping them from completely voiding," says Craig. As a result, these women have to go to the bathroom very often. "In these cases, we simply use biofeedback to train them to relax the muscles."

<h1>The Vigoro Story</h1>
</center>
Vigoro's roots in the Canadian plant nutrition business run very deep:  In
fact, all the way back to 1902. From the very beginning, the company has
developed an excellent reputation for top quality products designed to meet
individual market needs.<br>
<br>
Many of these products were true innovations that contributed much to the
good health of today's lawn and garden industry in Canada.
For example, in 1924 when Vigoro was known as Swift Canada Co., it launched
Canada's first home lawn and garden fertilizer containing micronutrients
for a fully balanced plant diet.<br>
<br>
In 1954, Vigoro launched the first non-burning lawn fertilizer with a slow
release nitrogen formulation that gave homeowners
a healthier lawn with fewer fertilizer applications. It was a great step
forward - and the rest of the industry soon followed.<br>
<br>
1968 marked another milestone for Vigoro, with the introduction of IBDU
(isobutylidene diurea) controlled-release nitrogen. 25 years later, this
product is still unmatched in its ability to deliver uniform release of
nutrients over an extended period of time.<br>
<br>
Over the years, one product has come to symbolize Vigoro's image of top
quality plant nutrition more than any other: Pink Vigoro. Recognized forty
years ago as the quality leader in garden fertilizers, "Pink" still enjoys
the same reputation today.<br>
<br>
Over the years, the Vigoro product line has expanded to include a full
range of consumer products to meet the needs of a growing home and garden
market.<Br>

<em>Dear Fellow Gardener,</em><br>
<br>
Vigoro Canada has published a print edition of the Gardener's Report since spring of 1994.<br>
<br>
Various editions have included articles on how to care for all kinds of plant life ... from lawns to vegetables, flower gardens, indoor plants and more. Many of these articles have been written by myself and the staff here at Vigoro in response to customer questions about the use of our products. (By the way, if you're not familar with Vigoro, we are a manufacturer of high quality, "Made-in-Canada" fertilizers for lawn and garden use ... including controlled release lawn foods, organic fertilizers, garden foods and water solubles.)<br>
<br>
The spring of 1996 marks the first time we have published the Vigoro Gardener's Report "online" on the World Wide Web. We hope you find the format useful and informative.<br>
<br>
Our goal is to help our customers get outstanding results when they grow with Vigoro products.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions, or comments on the Gardener's Report (positive or negative) please drop us an e-mail note.<br>
<Br>
We plan to expand our net site in the coming months, and are very interested to hear your views on what we might offer here.<br>
<br>
Thank you for visiting Vigoro Canada's homepage.<br>
<br>
Yours truly,<br>

<h1>Tips on starting plants 
from seed</h1>
<h2>For many people, it's the preferred way <br>
to begin a garden.</h2>
<img src="plantng.gif">
</center>
<br>
If you only draw  on local resources of bedding and potted plants,
you're likely missing a huge variety of plant types ... beautiful,
healthy flowers and vegetables that are often only available as
seed.<br>
<br>
Many veteran gardeners prefer to grow from seed, for a number of
reasons:<br>
<br>
<img src="greenball.gif"> A bigger variety of plants to choose from.<br>
<br>
<img src="greenball.gif"> Much lower costs, so you can fill a larger area of garden on a
budget.<br>
<br>
<img src="greenball.gif"> Start gardening earlier in the spring.<br>
<br>
<img src="greenball.gif"> A greater sense of accomplishment.<Br>
<br>
<img src="greenball.gif"> Just plain fun.<br>
<br>
Gardeners who grow from seed also maintain their plants are
healthier and hardier.<br>
<br>
Your local garden center will likely have a broad selection of
seeds in stock. They can help you choose the types best suited for
your growing conditions, and 
usually have good information available on growing from seeds.<br>
<br>
Here's a brief "how to" guide to get you started:<Br>
<br>
<b>Supplies:</b><br>
<br>
Pick up a supply of growing trays and mini-pots at your garden
center. Make sure they're the kind that allow good drainage. Also
get some sterilized potting soil - important to prevent seedlings
being attacked by soil-borne disease or fungus.<br>
<br>
<b>Planting:</b><br>
<br>
Depending on the type of plant, start seeds 4 to 8 weeks before the
last frost if you plan to move them outdoors. If you plan to keep
your plants inside, start anytime. <br>
<br>
Nearly-fill each compartment of your tray/mini-pots with sterilized
soil. Sprinkle a few seeds into each compartment/pot and cover with
a little soil. Water well and cover each tray/pot with clear
plastic. Store in a warm place. <br>
<br>
Once the seedlings have appeared, uncover them and move to a sunny
spot, turning trays/pots 
regularly.<br>
<br>
Transfer to larger pots when the seedlings are 3 to 4 inches tall.<br>
<br>
<b>Moving seedlings into the garden</b><br>
<br>
Two weeks before you're ready to transplant, "harden" your new
seedlings by taking them outdoors for a few hours each day. <br>
<br>
It's a good idea to prepare your garden soil a couple of weeks
ahead of planting, too. Tilling the soil early will fool weeds into
germinating early, and you can then pull them to reduce competition
with your seedlings. When there is no longer any risk of frost,
take the seedlings out of the pots and plant them into the garden.<br>
<br>
Water regularly (but don't over water) and feed with a high 
quality fertilizer like PINK Vigoro or Instant Vigoro Water Soluble
Plant Starter 10-52-10. <br>
<br>
Perennials started from seed will usually re-grow larger the
following spring, and spread rapidly if conditions favour their
growth. You can also try harvesting seeds from your annual plants
and vegetables (except for hybrid varieties) for replanting the
following year. Dry the seeds slowly, and store them in a cool, dry
place over winter. Then repeat the same planting steps outlined
earlier.<br>
<br>
Give seeds a try this spring. It's a great way to increase your
gardening satisfaction ... and a good activity for children, too!

</CENTER>
<br>
Do you have a crabgrass problem in your lawn? You'll recognize the
symptoms in the fall, especially if you've noticed patches of coarse purple grasses in
your lawn.<br>
<br>
Crabgrass can spread particularly quickly around the edges of the<br>
lawn, and along driveways and paths. The problem is most prevalent
in Ontario.<br>
<br>
It's an ugly grass weed that invades weaker areas of the lawn, and
gradually takes over, creating thin, off-colour patches that detract from the lawn's
overall appearance. In late spring the plants are a light, lime
green colour with wide, short blades. If such plants appear in the
lawn as soon as the snow disappears, they are not crabgrass, and
wont' be controlled by a crabgrass preventer.<br>
<br>
<b>A healthy lawn: The best defense.</b><br>
<br>
A lush, healthy lawn provides its own best defense against
crabgrass, because it allows few areas for the weed seeds to
germinate and establish new plants. Regular fertilization is the key to a healthy lawn ... making sure the grass gets the complete nutrition it needs to fight weed competition and resist stress from winter drought or other environmental conditions.<br>
<br>
A typical "four-step" lawn 
fertilization program might look like this:<br>
<br>
<b>1. Early Spring,</b> either with a 
regular lawn fertilizer or a 
fertilizer with crabgrass control blended in.<br>
<br>
<b>2. Early summer,</b> regular fertilizer or "weed & feed" to control
broadleaf weeds.<br>
<br>
<b>3. Late summer,</b> regular fertilizer or a combination feeding/insect
control if lawn pests are suspected. <br>
<br>
<b>4. Fall fertilizer,</b> a special blend to fight winter stress and
encourage fast spring green-up. (This may be the most 
important, but often overlooked lawn feeding.<br>
<br>
Be sure to use high quality, "controlled-release" fertilizers: They provide consistent feeding over several weeks, without risk of burning the lawn.<br>
<br>
<b>Crabgrass control strategies</b><br>
<br>
Crabgrass is an annual grass weed that must re-establish itself
from seed each spring. This is the secret to effective crabgrass 
control ... getting the preventer onto the soil early enough
(before May 15) to keep new seeds from germinating.<br>
<br>
The easiest way to apply a 
crabgrass preventer is to spread it on with your early spring
fertilizer application, around the time the forsythia blooms. Mow
the lawn once before applying the 
preventer, so it can easily get down to the soil surface.<br>
<br>
Vigoro makes a crabgrass 
preventer/fertilizer blend that works very well, controlling the
germinating seeds while it greens up the lawn. They also offer an
alternative granular crabgrass control without fertilizer, in case
you've already applied fertilizer separately. The control
ingredient (chlorthal) only affects crabgrass, and not other weeds
or most grasses. Avoid spreading crabgrass preventers  on newly
seeded lawns, bentgrass lawns or vegetable
 gardens. The soil must be left undisturbed after application to
allow the grass to work on the ungerminated seeds.
Be sure to read the product label carefully and wear protective
clothing.<br>

<title>The "Environmentally Friendly" Lawn</title>

<h1>The "Environmentally Friendly" Lawn</h1>
<h2>Organic or conventional fertilizer?</h2>
<img src="lawn.jpg">
</center>
<br>
A well-maintained lawn acts like a giant air filter, constantly
removing pollutants and carbon dioxide, and replenishing the oxygen
supply.<br>
<br>
A lawn is a valuable addition to every home environment, regardless
of its size. Today, most homeowners want to keep their lawn looking
green and healthy so it adds beauty to the house and enjoyment to
the family.<br>
<br>
( Also, a lush green lawn makes a better air filter than one that
is allowed to run wild.) At the same time, people are 
increasingly aware of the environmental aspects of lawn care. For
many, natural or "organic" options seem to be the way to go.
There is a lot of confusion in the lawn and garden market about
exactly what is meant by the terms "Natural" or "Organic". In fact,
some products that are positioned as organic can actually be more harmful to the
environment than "conventional" products.<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at lawn feeding from the plant's point of view.
All plants require 3 major nutrients - nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potash (K) - to survive. These 3 elements, often referred to as "chemical" 
fertilizers, are actually produced from elements found in nature...
they're refined from minerals mined from the ground. All 
fertilizers- conventional or organic- must contain some form of
these three nutrients for healthy plant growth. On a bag of
fertilizer, the percentage of each element is represented by a
number. For example, 24-4-8 lawn fertilizer contains 24% 
nitrogen, 4% phosphorus and 8% potash as active ingredients. On the
extreme "organic" side, cattle manure for example contains less
than 1% each of N,P and K and may contain a lot of weed seeds. It
is good for the lawn or garden, but more useful for building up
organic matter in the soil. It is unlikely to be able to supply
enough food for healthy plant growth. Higher quality natural
fertilizers deliver N,P and K in the form of unprocessed or
homogenous ingredients, such as blood or bone meal. They 
typically have lower N,P and K numbers than conventional 
fertilizers, but can provide a balanced diet to meet plant 
nutritional requirements.<br>
<br>
Nitrogen promotes healthy green foliage, phosphorus develops strong
roots and plentiful fruit or flowers, while potash improves overall
plant hardiness and disease resistance. The plant takes up only as much of these
elements as it needs. Any excess amount can be leached away into
the environment - whether the source is conventional or organic -
so it's just as important not to overfeed as it is to underfeed.<br>
<br>
This is where high quality "conventional" fertilizers can sometimes offer an advantage. They would appear to pose more of a risk because they contain much
higher quantities of N,P and K. But in fact, in a high quality
fertilizer the nutrients are designed to be released slowly, giving
plants only the food they need, over an extended period of time.
This reduces the risk of elements leaching into groundwater, and has the added benefit of
reducing the number of applications you need to make over the growing season.<br>
<br>
The key to maintaining a healthy, environmentally 
friendly lawn is in feeding it just the right amount of nutrients
for healthy growth, without overfeeding. You can achieve this with
either "all-natural" or "conventional" fertilizers.<br>

<title>The Burning Question:</title>
</header>
<body bgcolor="FFFFFF">
<body>
<center><img src="vigsmall.gif"><hr>
<h1>The Burning Question: </h1>
<h2>Why is it important to use a fertilizer spreader?</h2>
<img src="spread2.gif">
</center>
<br>
Occasionally a garden center will get a call from an unhappy
customer. They bought a bag of lawn fertilizer, spread it on the
lawn, and found to their dismay that some patches of the lawn were
burned, while other areas grew faster and taller than the rest.<br>
<br>
Experience has taught us that there's usually  one common element
in these mishaps: a proper lawn fertilizer spreader was not used.
Some people will have spread the fertilizer on carefully by hand:
this is especially not a good idea when using weed & feed or
insecticide formulations, where contact with the skin should be
avoided. Others might have employed a home-made device like a
coffee-can shaker. The result is usually patchy, inconsistent
growth, often with burned areas.<br>
<br>
To get a consistent, healthy lawn growth, you need precise
fertilizer application with consistent overlays, no missed areas, and no over-fertilized spots. Nothing beats a good quality lawn fertilizer spreader for this
task.<br>
<br>
Every bag of high quality lawn 
fertilizer should carry detailed instructions to help you get top 
results from its application, using a spreader. Here are some of
the key points:<br>
<br>
1. Measure the lawn area to be covered by multiplying the length of
the lawn x the width, in meters (approx. one normal walking
stride). Subtract the area of any buildings, driveway, etc, to get
the total number of square meters (m2) you need to apply fertilizer
on.<br>
<br> 
2. Buy the number of fertilizer bags you need to cover your lawn
area (coverage is usually listed on the front of the bag in square
feet or metres). Most lawn and garden centers will also rent you a
fertilizer spreader for a very reasonable charge.<br>
<br>
3. Adjust the spreader settings as per instructions on the back of
the bag. (While you're there, read the rest of the label, too!)
Fill the spreader away from the lawn.<br>
<br>
4. Apply the fertilizer in a criss-cross pattern, spreading one
half the total in each direction. Avoid misses or overlaps, and
shut off the spreader when turning corners or stopping. If any is
spilled, remove it or spread it with a broom and water heavily.<br>
<br>
<b>Lawn fertilizer quality does make a difference.</b><br>
<br>
Many homeowners find the task of choosing a lawn fertilizer a bit
intimidating. The numbers can be confusing... do you need a 
7-7-7 or a 24-4-8? Are controlled release nutrients really worth
the extra cost? <br>
<br>
The answers become easier to grasp when you look at fertilizers
from a lawn's point of view. The nutrient that contributes most to
green growth is nitrogen... and since lawns are mostly green, they
need a lot of it. On a bag of fertilizer, the nitrogen content is
represented by the first number (the other two represent phosphorus
and potassium content). A 7-7-7 formulation does not contain enough
nitrogen to support healthy turf growth over a long period of time.
However, increasing the content of "regular" nitrogen would
increase the risk of burning the lawn. That's why "controlled-
release nitrogen" was developed. Controlled-release nitrogen
sources like Vigoro's IBDU spread the nutrient release precisely
over a 10-12 week period, regardless of temperature or moisture
fluctuations. A higher content of "controlled-release" nitrogen
will ensure consistent feeding over a longer period of time and
virtually eliminate the risk of burning.

<h1>Controlled-Release Nitrogen</h1>
<h2>Lasting re-leaf for a tired, thinning lawn.</h2>
<img src="golden.gif">
</center>
<br>
How's your lawn shaping up this spring? thick, lush and green... or
maybe it's starting to show its age, and getting a little thin on
top?<br>
<br> 
Many lawns go through this process, becoming a little more sparse
each year, (except maybe for weeds), until eventually someone
decides to re-seed, or re-sod.<br>
<br>
There are many reasons why a lawn might fade away over time,
including insect damage, competition from weeds, poor soil, traffic, drought or too much
shade. Each of these can create stress for the lawn, and removal of
the problem will usually help our turf recover, at least to some
extent.<br>
<br>
A healthy lawn is its own best defense. Lawns that are thick and
lush are more able to fight off the effects of stress, compete with
weeds for valuable nutrients, and come out ahead. And the best way
to ensure a healthy lawn is with a good feeding program, plus water
as needed. Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium are essential for
good turf nutrition. A shortage of any nutrient can be a severely
limiting factor for the lawn.<br>
<br>
<b>Nitrogen</b> promotes lush green growth, which is exactly what you want
in a lawn.<br>
<br>
<b>Phosphorus</b> stimulates root formation and provides energy for the
plant.<br>
<br>
<b>Potassium</b> strengthens the plant tissue and increases resistance to
diseases.<br>
<br>
Just as important though, is the <U>kind</U> of nitrogen in the bag.
Regular nitrogen can release too quickly, burn the plant, and leach
away in the ground water in a matter of days. For a healthy, dark
green and consistent lawn, you need <b>Controlled Release Nitrogen.</b> It
is the key to maintaining your lawn in top condition, year after
year, and a key ingredient in top quality lawn foods.<br>
<br>
Vigoro's IBDU&reg;  is the best controlled release nitrogen you can
buy. Developed for use on golf courses, IBDU releases nitrogen
slowly and consistently over a 10-12 week period... regardless of
warm or cool, wet or dry conditions. Other brands contain "slow-
release" nitrogen which may vary the release depending on the
environment, and usually feed for only 6-8 weeks.<br>
<br>
With Golden Vigoro lawn fertilizers,  you can  provide constant
feeding year-round with 3 or 4 applications, including weed or pest
controls if needed. Here's an example:<br>
<br>
1. Early Spring (April-May):
Golden Vigoro 24-4-8 Lawn Fertilizer. Switch to Crabgrass Preventer
plus Fertilizer 20-4-8 if crabgrass is a problem.<br>
<br>
2. Early Summer (June-July):
Golden Vigoro 24-4-8 Weed & Feed to control tough broadleaf weeds
as it feeds the lawn. If weeds are not a problem, use regular
Golden Vigoro 24-4-8.<br>
<br>
3. Late Summer (Aug-Sept):
Golden Vigoro Insect Control plus Fertilizer 12-6-3, to control
white grubs, chinch bugs and other pests. Again, substitute with
regular Golden Vigoro 24-4-8 if bugs are not a problem.<br>
<br>
4. Fall(Oct-Nov):
Golden Vigoro Fall Fertilizer 12-2-12. This is one of the most
important feedings to help your lawn fight stress and stay in top
shape for the following spring. The nitrogen content is lower here
because the green growth is dormant over winter... but the IBDU
stays in the soil along with other nutrients, ready for spring
growth.<br>
<br>
This program is a sure way to give lasting "re-leaf" to a tired
lawn. Be sure to read the label before applying these fertilizers,
handle carefully and follow all directions.

<title>Ten steps to a great lawn.</title>
</header>

<h1>Ten steps to a great lawn.</h1>
<h2>A simple, "preventative maintenance" lawn care plan will keep your
lawn in top shape all year 'round.</h2>
<img src="forget.gif">
</center>
<br>
Just follow these 10 easy steps to keep your lawn at its best:<br>
<br>
<b>1. Start with a good soil preparation.</b> If you're starting a new
lawn, you'll never regret the investment you make now in improving
the soil, Grass grows best in a well-drained blend of topsoil, sand
and organic matter 
several inches deep. Remove any hard packed snow patches and rake
out old thatch to allow the grass to "breathe". Top up with
peatmoss, manure or topsoil.<br>
<br>
<b>2. Seed if necessary.</b> As with fertilizer, 
buying quality grass seed pays off in a thicker lawn. Use a good
quality mixture to patch bare spots, or spread overall late in fall
or early spring. Rake lightly to ensure the seed 
contacts the soil, apply a starter fertilizer and water as
necessary to keep the lawn from drying out.<br>
<br>
<b>3. Control crabgrass.</b> (Mainly in Ontario) 
In early spring, apply a Crabgrass Preventer, with or without
fertilizer, to control crabgrass as it starts to germinate.<br>
<br>
<b>4. Control broadleaf weeds.</b>Weeds like dandelion, 
plantain, chickweed and others compete with grass for soil
nutrients... and they usually win. Use a Weed & Feed fertilizer
when weeds are actively growing to solve the problem.<br>
<br>
<b>5. Water... but only if needed.</b> Don't be afraid to let the top
surface of the soil dry out... this will encourage deep-rooted
stress-tolerant grass.<br>
<br>
<b>6. Control insects.</b> White grubs, chinch bugs, leather jackets,
ants, wireworms and any common insects could destroy your lawn if
conditions favour them. Try this; cut out both ends of a coffee
tin, sink it half way into the lawn, and fill with water. If
several insects make their way to the surface, apply a fertilizer
such as Golden Vigoro with insect control.<br>
<br>
<b>7. Use the correct mower height.</b> In dry summer weather, let the
lawn grow out a bit, and then cut with the lawn mower set up
higher. In the fall, cut shorter again to avoid 
giving disease a place to develop in the foliage.<br>
<br>
<b>8. If you don't need to control weeds or insects, don't.</b>
Application of a regular lawn fertilizer like Golden Vigoro 24-4-8 
every 10 to 12 weeks is all you need to keep your lawn healthy.<br>
<br>
<b>9. Rake leaves so the grass can breathe.</b> Chopped up, they make a
great mulch for gardens.<br>
<br>
<b>10. Don't forget to feed in the fall.</b> It's one of the most
important feedings. For 
strengthening turf over the winter, use a fertilizer with less
nitrogen than a spring fertilizer, but higher potash levels. The
nitrogen stays put under the snow cover, ready for a quick start in
the spring.

<title>Annual Bedding Plants:</title>

<h1>Annual Bedding Plants:</h1>
<h2>Colourful, hard-working wonders.</h2>
<img src="annuals.jpg">
</center>
<br>
If perennial plants are the long distance runners in a garden,
annuals are the sprinters. They may not have the long-term
endurance, but for the season you have them, they sure make up for
it with big, brilliant long-lasting blooms.<br>
<br>
Whether you want to create a complete annual bed from scratch, or
fill in some bare spots in the perennial garden, annuals are always
up to the task. All you have to do is drop  in to your local garden
center, load up a cart, drive home and start 
planting ... right?<br>
<br>
Well, it can be that easy, especially if you're just plugging some
holes in an established garden or filling a container. But for
truly spectacular results on a complete annual garden it's best to
work  out a  plan in advance. <br>
<br>
Decide what kind of effect you want to achieve with your garden...
warm or cool colours, variations on a single colour, or a vibrant
mix of shapes, sizes and colours. You'll also want to choose plants
that are best suited to the growing conditions you have. <br>
<br>
Gardening books are a good source of information to help you choose
suitable plants in the colours you want. <br>
<br>
Most bedding plants are also tagged with information about their
growth requirements... whether they need full sun, partial shade or
full shade, and what kind of soil conditions they like. Few plants
will thrive if their new environment is quite different than the
tag outlines.<br>
<br>
When you do head out to pick up your plants, here are a few tips to
help you make sure you get full value for your budget.<br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="greenball.gif"><b>Buy the healthiest plants you can find,</b> with deep green colour
and compact, bushy growth.<br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="greenball.gif"><b>Choose plants that haven't begun to bloom yet.</b> Plants with
unopened buds will establish faster.<br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="greenball.gif"><b>Avoid stressed plants.</b> Bargain-priced plants displayed on a hot
sidewalk or parking lot can suffer from wilt or damaged roots that
will inhibit their growth.<br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="greenball.gif"><b>Watch for signs of insect or
 disease damage:</b> If you see them, don't buy. Buying from a
reputable grower or garden center is your best assurance of good
quality bedding plants. <br>
<br>
When you get your annuals home, keep them in a cool, lightly shaded
area and keep them watered until you're ready to plant, so the
tender roots and shoots don't dry out too quickly.<br>
<br>
It's also a good idea to work your garden soil up one or two weeks
ahead of time. This will fool weeds into thinking it's time to
start growing... then you can go out and pull them, before they can
compete with your new bedding plants for valuable nutrients.<br>
<br>
It's also good exercise, gets you in the gardening mood, and
reduces some of the workload on planting day. Get any nearby
children involved!<br>
<br>
When you're ready to start planting, space the seedlings out in the
garden, allowing enough room for each plant to reach its full size.
Place each plant in its own hole or dig a trench for a row of
seedlings. Place the plants in carefully, fill around the roots,
press to firm soil, and water in well.<br>
<br>
Regular watering and feeding with a quality fertilizer like
Canagro's new Flowering Annual Bedding Plant Fertilizer or PINK
Vigoro will keep them in top condition.

<h1>Perennials: For a Garden<br>
That Keeps on Giving</h1>
<img src="perennia.gif">
</center>
<br>
In the "disposable" 1980's, 
annuals were the thing. You just had to plunk down your money in
the spring, dig the plants into your garden and presto - instant
gratification.<br>
<br>
Now, perennial flowers - the kind that re-appears and bloom year
after year, are regaining their traditional popularity among
gardeners ... And for a lot of good reasons. (In fact, they've
never lost any appeal among dedicated gardeners).<br>
<br>
While annuals offer a bright splash in the garden, they come with
a sense of, well ... 
impermanence. The 90's have brought a return to basic values - and
although perennials usually cost more at the garden center, they
reward the gardener with season after season of often 
subtle beauty. Then too, they often multiply, providing new stocks
for expanded gardens, or for trading with other gardeners.<br>
<br>
One of the most vital ingredients for a successful perennial bed is
your garden plan. <br>
<br>
Before you rush out to buy a trunkload of perennials, draw out a
plan of your garden place that:  <br>
<br>
(A) identifies what plants you'll obtain that are suitable for your
growing conditions. (amount of shade, soil conditions, etc.)  <br>
<br>
(B)  Places these plants in a pleasing composition (informal areas
usually work best) with larger and taller plant generally in the
back, and smaller and lower plants in the front.  <br>
<br>
(C)  Distributes plants according to colour and blooming time, so
their display will be pleasing for a longer period of time. Don't
let these steps intimidate you -you'll have lots of time to "fine-
tune" your plan in future seasons. And don't hesitate to ask your
garden center for help.<br>
<br>
There are a great number of perennial plants available today - so
take your plan to the garden center when you visit. It will help
you keep your quantities, and your budget, under control. Remember
too it's important to resist the temptation to shoe-horn plants
into the garden too tightly ... they need room to grow properly,
and air-space to minimize disease problems. Check the tags to be
sure you allow for all their potential. Here, too, any mistakes can
usually be corrected later. Most perennials can be dug up, divided
and moved later with few problems.<br>
<br>
The next step is to prepare the soil. Dig and turn the soil over to
a depth of at least a foot ... even deeper is better. If the soil
is compacted  or sandy, also dig in  some topsoil, compost or well-
rotted manure to improve the soil texture. <br>
<br>
Because soil pH (acid or alkaline) levels are important for plant
selection, a soil test is also a good idea. This early preparation
can make a tremendous difference in the size and quality of your
garden plants later on. <br>
<br>
An overcast day is ideal for planting, because there's less risk of
the plant's tender roots and shoots drying out. Keep the root ball
well watered in any case, and protect the plant from harsh sunlight
until you're ready to put it in the ground. Dig a hole a little
larger than the root ball, and carefully remove the plant from
plastic pots. For peat pots, slit the pot in several places to
allow the roots to exit, and tear off the upper rim. Place the
plant in the hole, fill and firm soil around the top. Water in
well, and feed regularly with a high quality fertilizer like PINK
Vigoro.

<h1>Gardening in Cyberspace</h1>
<h2>Now you can exercise your green thumb on the 
keyboard as well as in the garden.</h2>
<img src="cybrgard.gif">
</center>
<br>
It seems everywhere you turn these days, someone is talking about
their latest experience on the internet.... and gardeners are no
exception.<br>
<br>
Many people enjoy gardening because it keeps them in touch with
down-to-earth values (and away from today's fast-pace technological
change). However, a growing number of green thumbs have been
tapping the keyboards lately, too.<br>
<br>
The world wide web is a great source of gardening information for
those prepared to go looking for it. You'll find people helping
each other solve gardening problems from half way around the world,
and from just across town, without leaving the comfort of their
armchairs. And all for the cost of a local call, regardless of the
distances involved.<br>
<br>
Several companies offer a range of gardening-related services over
'the net', too. There are direct-to-home catalogue shopping
locations for seed, plants and garden tools, helpful technical
advice, and bulletin boards where gardeners can post notes about
problems, products and proven techniques. Some not-so-proven
ones,too. You can even take a virtual picture tour of gardens
around the world, or plan a garden-visiting vacation on-line.
If you're already hooked up, here are a few notable home pages you
might want to visit: (Keep in mind, web sites are constantly
changing, updating and disappearing, so this list may not be
current). Or, just type Gardening into your search engine and
browse through the dozens of sites displayed.<br>

<h1>Got a shady area?</h1>
<h2>Why not plant a Wildflower Garden?</h2>
<img src="perwild.gif">
</center>
<br>
Wildflowers may be the perfect answer to a shady problem on your
lot. They thrive on 
conditions that defeat many other types of flowers. And you may be
surprised to find that many of the perennial plants available
through garden centers are actually "tame" wildflowers, nearly
identical to their cousins growing in natural areas. Columbine,
Jacob's ladder, Creeping or blue Phlox, Bleeding Heart and
Solomon's seal are just a few examples. You'll find they blend
beautifully in a shady setting along with woodland favourites like
Jack-in-the-pulpit, Foam flower, Trout lily and a wide range of
ferns.<br>
<br>
Don't be tempted to rush  out, spade in hand, and dig plants out of
the wilds, though. (Besides being illegal in many areas, it's
unfriendly to wild plants and the environment).<br>
<br>
Many nurseries and garden 
centers have special wildflower sections, and they can advise you
on which plants will naturalize well in you garden conditions.<br>
<br>
When choosing and preparing a site for your wildflower garden, keep
in mind the kind of natural habitat these plants prefer: moist,
humus-rich soil in an area that has lightly dappled shade in the
springtime when they're flowering, and more shade cover in late
spring and summer to keep the habitat from drying out. Like most
other plants, wildflowers will not survive  in a very dark,
compacted area.<br>
<br>
Spend some tine preparing a good deep bed with plenty of compost
and mulch mixed in, then plant in an informal pattern - wildflowers
look best in groups as they would appear in the wild.<br>
<br>
Your new garden  will fill  out faster, bloom more abundantly and
withstand stress better if you feed it regularly with a fertilizer
like Canagro Naturalizing Wildflower & Herb Garden Food, available
at your Vigoro dealer. This top quality organic blend contains all
the nutrients needed by wildflowers for healthy growth. And don't
forget water, so the soil doesn't dry out too deeply.<br>
<br>
Given the right growing 
environment, wildflowers soon spread ... and you'll be rewarded
with bright splashes of colour, crisp white blooms and cool, rich
greens to enjoy for years to come.<br>
<br>
<b>How to keep wildlife from 
turning your new garden 
into a salad bar.</b><br>
<br>
It's not surprising that animals, birds and insects are attracted
to   the garden environment with all it has to offer. And many
gardeners enjoy the increased level of wildlife activity a new
garden brings. But how do you keep these creatures from dining out
too heavily on your flowers and foliage?<br>
<br>
Many perennials are naturally resistant to insects and animals:  Due
to their taste or poisonous nature, wildlife will avoid them.    Here
are some examples:<br>
<br>
<b>Resistant to deer & 
other animals:</b><br>
<br>
Astilbe, bleeding heart, columbine, daffodil, foxglove, iris,
periwinkle, lavender, lungwort, sunflower<br>
<br>
<b>Resistant to insects:</b><br>
<br>
Marigolds <br>
<br>
<b>Other controls:</b><br>
<br>
There are some quite effective "natural" animal repellents on the
market that are worth trying. (Some gardeners sprinkle blood meal
around to deter deer. While we can't vouch for it's effectiveness
as a repellent, it will at least improve soil fertility). <br>
<br>
Try insecticidal soap for insects. As a general rule, use more
organic controls first ... then more 
powerful insecticides if necessary.

<title>The Water Garden:</title>

<body bgcolor="FFFFFF">

<h1>The Water Garden:</h1>
<h2>Add some depth to your background retreat</h2>
<img src="waterlil.jpg">
</center>
<br>
Picture the scene: Lush aquatic plants, rocks, water lily blooms,
a small waterfall, the occasional orange flash of a fish just under
the surface. In the background, the soothing music of water, 
gurgling and trickling among the stones.<br>
<br>
Now put the picture in your own backyard, and yourself in the 
picture - it's easier than you might think.<br>
<br>
Water gardens are becoming tremendously popular in Canadian
gardens, and it's easy to see why. They're beautiful, restful and
very  rewarding for the gardener. Because of their popularity, you
can find many more specialized sources for water garden plants,
supplies and installation than you could a few years ago.<br>
<br>
When it comes to planning and installing a water garden you have a
lot of options between the two extremes - having a landscape
contractor do it all for you, or making it an entirely "do-it-
yourself" project. Here too, your local garden supply center can
likely help. Many now have a water garden area set aside, with
plans, pool liners, pumps, plants and other elements  in stock.
Don't hesitate to ask for their advice.<br>
<br>
As with any other type of garden, it's important to start with a
plan. Pay special attention to how the garden will fit into your
overall landscape. You want to be sure you can appreciate your
water garden to its fullest, enjoying various viewpoints and nearby
sitting areas. A natural slope can be used to advantage  with
multiple levels and water falls. <br>
<br>
Experiment by laying out the pool areas with rope or garden hose.
If you plan to stock the pond with fish, you'll either have to make
a pool at least 3 feet deep in cold areas to allow for ice, or
bring the fish inside to a tank over winter. If you have raccoons
in the neighbourhood, you might want to forget the fish.<br>
<br>
Once you've determined the size of the pool(s), visit your garden
center to check out available liner sizes - either flat sheeting
that can be contoured to fit your 
excavation, or pre-moulded containers. You'll also want to look at
pumps and filters to keep the water moving aerated and clean ... an
important factor for healthy plant and pond life. Once you've
selected your liner, you're ready to start digging. Careful
installation will help avoid headaches later on, so take your time.
When your 
garden is fully installed and 
operable, you're ready for the plants.<br>
<br>
Water garden plants come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes,
from lilies that grow entirely in the water, to marsh-loving plants
that will thrive at water's edge. Start with a few plants, and add
more as your garden settles in. Many plants can be left in their
containers, so they're easier to move or bring indoors if required.
Don't add fish or other pond life until the water has settled after
planting.<br>
<br>
It's just as important to feed the plants in your water garden as
it is to feed the fish - you just don't have to do it as often.
Vigoro makes a new water garden plant food that's perfect for the
job ... just place the required number of briquettes in the plant
pots, and forget about them for the rest of the season. They
release nutrients slowly and safely, without risk to pond life,
filters or equipment. Ask for Vigoro Water Garden Briquettes.

<h1>Could your garden pass a soil test?</h1>
<img src="soilsetl.gif">
</center>
<br>
How well do you know your soil? It's an important question for the
health of the plants in and around your house. Good soil does more
than provide a foundation for roots to grab on to. Well-structured
soil lets the roots breathe easily, provides the right amount of
nutrients and water to the plant, and has the right pH balance for
the kind of plants you're trying to grow.<br>
<br>
Poor soil can inhibit plant growth in a number of ways. If it has
too high a clay content, it will compact easily, drain poorly,
prevent air from getting to the roots, and dry into hard clumps. If
it's too sandy, it will drain too quickly, erode easily and have
difficulty holding nutrients for the plants to use. Good soil
strikes a balance between these two extremes. When you pick up a
handful, it feels moist and loose without falling through your
fingers, has a fresh, clean smell, and a rich dark colour.<br>
<br>
To find out what your soil structure is like, stir a handful into
a clear glass of water and let it sit for several hours, until the
water clears. The coarse, heavier sand particles will eventually
settle to the bottom, with silt layering the top. The finer clay
particles will eventually settle on top, and some humus (organic
matter) will likely float on top of the clear water. Looking at the
side of the glass, you can tell what your soil is primarily made
of.<br>
<br>
If it's mostly sand, digging in lots of high-organic topsoil and
peat moss will improve it a great deal.If it's mostly silt and
clay, it will benefit from the addition of washed sand to help it
drain and aerate well.<br>
<br>
All soils will benefit from liberal applications of compost. Work
the soil by turning it over and mixing it well to a depth of at
least one foot, before planting.<br>
<br>
<b>SOIL pH LEVELS</b><br>
<br>
Acidity or alkalinity in the soil is measured by pH values,  on a
scale of 1 (most acid) to 14 (most alkaline) with a level of 7
considered "neutral" Each level is ten times more or less than the
next, ie. 5 is a ten times more acidic than 6 and 100 x more
acidic than 7. A pH level of 8 is ten times more alkaline than 7,
and so on.<br>
<br>
The pH level influences the availability of nutrients for you
plants, and the type of plants you can grow. For example, azaleas
and rhododendrons like a lot of iron, a micronutrient that becomes
less available to plants as soil alkalinity increases. These plants
prefer a more acid soil, where iron is freely available... other
wise, their leaves become yellow between the veins. Unavailability
of many other nutrients can have widely ranging, but equally
damaging effects.<br>
<br>
Most plants will grow well in a pH range of 6.5 to 7.2, where
nutrients are readily available to them and this is a good area to
strive for. But to start, it helps to know what your present soil
pH value is.<br>
<br>
You can buy a simple, inexpensive soil test kit from your garden
center, or ask them for local resources for testing soil samples.<br>
<br>
Alkaline soils can be neutralized by adding peat moss, or small
amounts of Vigoro Aluminum Sulphate. Acid soils can be neutralized
by adding Canagro Dolomitic Limestone. Be sure to read the label
and change the soil pH slowly and carefully, to ensure you don't
upset the balance too far in the opposite direction. Compost will
also help neutralize soil pH and add nutrients at the same time.<br>
<br>
<b>SOIL NUTRIENTS</b><br>
<br>
All plants need a good balance of the major nutrients, Nitrogen,
Phosphorus and Potash, as well as minor or "micro" nutrients such
as magnesium, copper, iron, calcium, manganese and many others in
minute quantities. You can test your soil for the presence of these
nutrients, and add those that are needed in the form of fertilizer.
They will quickly become available to the plants (providing your
soil pH is fairly neutral) and promote healthy growth. Regardless
of pH level, the absence of any key nutrient can cause growth
problems. Using a good quality general purpose fertilizer like PINK
Vigoro will help to ensure plants get the balanced nutrition they
need.

<h1>Dark Secrets:</h1>
<h2>Shedding some light on gardening in the shade.</h2>
<img src="shadeg.gif">
</center>
<br>
Shade presents its own set of 
challenges for the gardener... but if you consider it an
opportunity rather than a liability, you can create beautiful
landscaping effects. Shade gardens are particularly inviting in the
heat of summer, providing a cool respite from the sun. And while
shade gardens are known for their rich greens, they also provide
colourful options as well.<br>
<br>
The first step to building a 
successful shade garden is to 
determine the type of shade you have. This is an important factor
in choosing plants that will thrive. Plants that do well in shade
usually have more chlorophyll than plants adapted to the sun.
They're more sensitive to light and too much sunlight will burn
them or turn leaves yellow.<br>
<br>
There are four broad categories of shade that are used as
landscaping industry standards. These include:<br>
<br>
<b>1. <u>Dappled Shade</u></b>, the brightest category. This is the type of light
shade caused by  moving shadows from open trees.<br>
<br>
<b>2. <u>Open Shade</u></b> is found on the north side of buildings, fences, etc.
where direct sunlight is blocked, but indirect light is bounced
into the shadow areas.<br>
<br>
<b>3. <u>Medium Shade</u></b> is also found on northern exposures, but light is
further prevented from reaching the area by trees, foliage and
branches. Lawns in areas like this will be more sparse than in
brighter areas.<br>
<br>
<b>4. Dense Shade</u></b> presents the biggest challenge for growth, and
limits plant selection options. It is found in north-facing areas
shielded by  high walls on the sides or under a dense canopy of
trees.<br>
<br>
Make a note of where these shade types fall around your home before
planning the garden. You may be able to increase light levels in
some areas by pruning foliage to allow more light through, or by
painting walls or fences a lighter colour to reflect more light on
to shaded areas.<br>
<br>
Once you've determined the shade levels around your home, your
garden center can help you select plants that are adapted to each
area. There are many options for all but the deepest shade. Here
are just a few:<br>
<br>
<b>Plant: Rhododendron, Azalea<br>
Description:</b> Evergreen shrub with attractive, waxy leaves. Red,
pink, white flowers bloom spring to mid-summer.<br>
<b>Preferred Environment</b><br>
Dappled shade, moist, acid soil. Plant with plenty of well-watered
peat moss around the root ball.<br>
<br>
<b>Plant: Impatiens<br>
Description:</b> Annual flowering plant with white, pink, red, orange
or magenta flowers and attractive foliage.<br>
<b>Preferred Environment</b><br>
Light to dense shade, moist soil. Also ideal for containers.<br>
<br>
<b>Plant: Hosta<br>
Description:</b> Large, broad leaves, on clusters of many stems,
sometimes variegated. White to lilac blooms mid-summer to fall.<br>
<b>Preferred Environment</b><br>
Light to dense shade, rich well-drained soil.<br>
<br>
<b>Plant: Tuberous Begonia<br>
Description:</b> Showy flowers in white, yellow,  pink, orange and red,
with large dark green or red-green leaves.<br>
<b>Preferred Environment</b><br>
Light shade in moist, well-drained  soil. Must be brought indoors
to survive over winter.<br>
<br>
<b>Plant: Wildflower-type perennials:</b><br> lily-of-the-valley, columbine,
jacob's ladder, trillium, purple violets, bloodroot, dog-violet,
hepatica, ferns, etc.<br>
<b>Description:</b> A wide range of colourful flowers in early spring,
changing to lush green foliage as trees leaf out.<br>
<b>Preferred Environment</b><br>
Light to dappled shade in springtime, to deep shade in summer. Use
only those types cultivated for sale in garden centers, not dug up
in the wild<br>
<br>
There are many more types of shade-loving or shade-tolerant plants
available... and the results can be quite spectacular.<br>
<br>
Most shade plantings will benefit from the addition of compost, and
be sure to fertilize regularly. Use any good quality all-purpose
fertilizer such as PINK Vigoro, or Canagro organic Perennial or
Wildflower fertilizer.

<title>Pruning: Clip your way to a better plantscape.</title>

<h1>Pruning: Clip your way to <br>
a better plantscape.</h1>
<IMG SRC="shears.gif">
</center>
<br>
Are you one of those people who shy away from pruning, whether it's
a houseplant, a rosebush, or a tree? Think you might hurt the
plant? Stop worrying.<br>
<br>
Most plants appreciate some type of pruning now and then.  They'll
not only survive, but thrive as a result of it.<br>
<br>
Pruning should be used to remove dead, insect-infested or diseased
parts, and branches that cross, rub together or appear structurally
weak. It can improve the overall look of a plant, allow better air
circulation and light access, and restore a good balance between
root and top growth (either can be pruned).<br>
<br>
<b>Here are a few guidelines for pruning:</b><br>
<br>
1. Choose plants carefully with regard to their mature size. It's
not good practice to keep a tree or shrub trimmed far under its
natural size.<br>
<br>
2. With young trees, remove limbs gradually over the course of
several years as the tree grows.<br>
<br>
3. Prune less on evergreen trees with needles, as they don't regrow
as well as hardwoods.<br>
<br>
4. Avoid pruning during periods of active growth if possible.
Spring-flowering plants should be pruned immediately after
flowering.<br>
<br>
5. Use sharp tools that leave clean cuts. It's a good idea to dip
them in alcohol between cuttings to reduce the risk of transferring
diseases from one plant to another. <br>
<br>
6. Cut just above a bud, on an angle, with the lower part of the
cut opposite the bud, and facing the center of the tree (see
illustration).<br>
<br>
7. To allow more light to reach the foliage, you can prune some
branches all the way up the main stem... especially those that
angle up sharply, are damaged or cross over other branches.<br>
<br>
8. Potbound plants will benefit from root pruning and replanting.
Trim an inch (or more for large plants) off the entire surface of
the rootball with a sharp knife.<br>
<br>
9. Spring is generally the best time to prune. Check with your
gardening center if you're unsure about a particular type of plant.<br>
<br>
<b>The pruner's toolbox:</b><br>
<br>
As with most tasks, a good set of  tools, kept in well-maintained
and sharp condition, can really make your pruning jobs a lot
easier. Here are a selection of tools to consider if you don't
already have them:<br>
<br>
<em>Pruning shears</em> are an essential garden tool. Resembling pliers or
a pair of short, heavy duty scissors, these are ideal for cutting
branches or stems up to finger-width. The curved-bypass design is
probably most useful all-around.<br>
<br>
<em>Loppers</em> are heavier-duty, long handled cutters that are ideal for
branches from 2-4cm (3/4-11/2") thick. Look for sturdy handles that
provide lots of leverage and a curved-bypass blade design.<br>
<br>
<em>A pruning saw</em> is useful to have for larger branches. A folding type
is fine for smaller jobs. A duplex saw, with coarse teeth on one
side of the blade for heavy cutting, and fine teeth on the other
side, is another option.<br>
<br>
For taller trees, a <em>long-reach pole saw and lopper</em> allows cutting
of overhead branches without the use of a ladder.

<h1>Flower, Herb & Vegetable 
Container Gardening: </h1>
<h2>A great alternative for the spatially challenged</h2>
<img src="hanging.jpg">
</center>
<br>
If you have a green thumb but you're short on space to 
exercise it, container gardening might be the answer.<br>
<br>
You can grow just about 
anything in containers, indoors or out. Vegetables, flowering
plants, herbs, small shrubs or houseplants can be grown 
separately or combined for a unique visual effect.<br>
<br>
The same rules apply as for "regular" gardening:<br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="greenball.gif"> Start with a good soil mixture.<br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="greenball.gif"> Allow for drainage, and be sure not to overwater.<br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="greenball.gif"> Choose plants suited to the light available.<br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="greenball.gif"> Feed regularly.<br>
<br>
Vigoro makes an excellent controlled-release fertilizer called
Vigoro Flowering Container and Hanging basket food 14-12-14. Just
sprinkle the required amount on the soil... it feeds for the entire
season.<br>
<br>
<b>A fresh herb garden to tempt the palate</b><br>
<bR>
Fresh-picked herbs can make a delicious difference in the salads
you make and the foods you cook ... and they make a great addition
to the garden, too. They offer a treat to the senses - sight,
taste, smell, touch - that is unrivaled by other plant types.
There's nothing like the fresh fragrance that greets you when you
step outside near a collection of herb plants.<br>
<br>
Growing herbs successfully is not difficult ... in fact, they'll
fit in just about anywhere as long as they get adequate 
sunshine - most require at least 6 hours a day.<br>
<br>
You can plan a special garden just for herbs, or blend them in with
other plants in a vegetable, perennial or rose garden. Or plant
them in containers kept handy to the kitchen where you can snip a
sprig or two just as you need it ... herbs thrive on frequent
pruning. (In fact, they prefer it.)<br>
<br>
Soil for herbs should be well-prepared and well-drained, and
slightly acidic for best results. Blend in Vigoro  Naturalizing
Wildflower and Herb Food when planting, and use as a topdress when
additional feeding is required. <br>
<br>
Your enjoyment of the herb 
garden doesn't have to end with the growing season. Many gardeners
dry and store herbs for future use - it's easy enough to be worth
the effort - especially when you taste the results. It's best to
harvest the plants on cool cloudy days. Cut them cleanly and place
them in cool water to avoid wilting.<br>
<br>
The secret to maintaining all the delicious taste and fragrance of
your herbs is in the drying process. Whether you hang bunches    by
their stems, or lay them out on screens, it's 
important to keep the foliage loose, allowing good air 
circulation. The ideal drying location will be warm (not hot), dark
and well ventilated  to avoid the risk of mildew.<br>
<br>
When the herbs are dry but before they become brittle, move them
into glass or 
crockery containers, label them to avoid confusion, and date them.
Depending on the plant, they'll last from 6 months to 
3 years or more.

<title>How to attract beneficial critters into the garden</title>

<h1>How to attract beneficial<br> 
critters into the garden</h1>
<h2>Mother Nature and some old-fashioned ideas <br>
can often get the job done</h2>
<img src="gard3.gif">
</center>
<br>
The garden offers tremendous appeal to the taste buds of all kinds
of pests. Tender roots, shoots and leaves are found there that just
aren't available to pests in the "wilds". When you think about it,
you can't blame insects and other critters for viewing your garden
efforts as just so much meal preparation. But you can stop them.<br>
<br>
Of course, there are many chemical controls available on the
market, most of them developed in the last 50 years in the interest
of increased agricultural production. But many gardeners prefer to
use these only as a last resort, or not at all. In fact, today most
farmers are using fewer chemicals than they did 10 years ago, and
are reverting back to more organic control methods, and a technique
called "Integrated Pest Management".<br>
<br>
That's a technical-sounding name for a technique that has been used
by growers for more than a century. What it means is that the
farmer takes advantage of the presence of beneficial "predators" to
control harmful ones ... and avoids the  use of pest-control
techniques which might harm the beneficial ones when they're
present.<br>
<br>
A wide range of creatures, from birds to bats, snakes to spiders,
toads, insects and other wildlife can all play an important role in
reducing pest damage in the lawn or garden.<br>
<br>
So the best place to start your pest control program is by
encouraging these predators (or at least as many as you can stand)
to take up residence in your garden. Here are a few tips on how to
do that:<br>
<br>
Birds feed on a wide variety of insects and worms in the garden -
even in winter they reduce levels of over wintering insects and
their eggs found  on the bark of trees and shrubs. Put up lots of
birdhouses to attract different species. Make sure you put out feed
all winter. You can also include favoured trees and shrubs in the
landscape to improve the habitat for birds.<br>
<br>
Beneficial Insects such as spiders, ladybugs and bees are very
beneficial to the garden. Avoid using chemical pesticides to
control harmful insects when there are substantial populations of 
these in  the garden.<br>
<br>
Physical Controls such as traps, guards and hand picking can work
well to reduce garden pest levels. A cardboard tube pushed into the
earth around the stem will foil cutworms. Snails, slugs and large
caterpillars can be removed by hand and dropped into a can of soap
and water. Diatomaceous earth, available at garden centers is
another natural pest preventer. Sprinkled on  the soil around your
plants, its sharp grit cuts into the tender bodies of slugs or
insects, killing them or at least re-routing them away from the
garden. Sticky yellow paper traps are effective against white flies.<br>
<br>
If any or all of the above fail to slow the spread of damage in
your garden, chemical sprays may be the only answer. Some of these
present relatively low risks to the user and the environment
compared to others. Ask your lawn and garden retailer for a
recommendation on these - (take along a sample of the damaged
plants) and don't forget to read the label before using any
pesticide. Pest Resistant Plants are another option to reduce
damage in the garden. And don't forget that the first line of
defense against pests or diseases is a healthy plant. You have
organic options here, too: Canagro All-Natural Organic Fertilizers
are guaranteed to give pure growing satisfaction.

<title>A Guide to Ground Covers</title>
</header>

<H1>A Guide to Ground Covers</h1>
<h2>An attractive option to turf, and a solution for areas <br>
where nothing else grows well.</h2>
<img src="gard1.gif">
</center>
<br>
Sometimes, despite all your best efforts, you just can't get grass
to grow in some areas. Maybe it's time to give ground covers a try.<br>
<br>
Once established, low-growing perennial plants such as periwinkle,
ivy, stonecrop, thyme, pachysandra and cotoneaster can provide a
lush, natural-looking alternative to turf, and eventually require
very little maintenance. They're great in shady areas, around trees
and on hillsides where lawns can be virtually impossible to 
maintain, although most are not tolerant to heavy traffic.<br>
<br>
Ground covers are usually more costly to install than grass, so
it's worth making the extra effort to choose the best types for you
area and create a good growing environment for them.<br>
<br>
Your garden center can give you advice on these. Usually ground
covers look best when planted in larger, informal groups. Some
types can be planted near each other without fighting for
territory, while others can't. In many cases, lawns and
groundcovers can complement each other nicely... especially when
the planting  areas  for each are well chosen with regard to
overall shapes, varying soil conditions, light levels, etc. Putting
a detailed garden plan down on paper will help the planning process
a great deal... helping to avoid problems and improve the use of
your plantscaping budget, too.<br>
<br>
If the groundcovers are going into an area where some traffic is
likely to occur, give some consideration to laying down a pathway
of interlocking bricks, flagstones or other material. the path can
be informal, following  the natural contours of your landscape, or
in a symetrical, straight-line design with borders to complement a
formal garden style. If you're uncertain about which style is best
for your lot, ask your garden centre if a landscape specialist
could stop by your home and provide some recommendations.<br>
<br>
While low maintenance is a long-term benefit of most ground covers,
expect to spend the first 2 or 3 years helping the new plantings
fight off 
competition from weeds, until they  fill in. You'll have to weed by
hand, as commercial herbicides would generally harm the ground
cover as well as the weeds. Mulching around individual groundcover
plants can also help keep weed competition down for the first 2 or
3 years, while giving your plants an opportunity to spread through
root and shoot development.<br>
<br>
You should feed new plantings with a high phosphorus fertilizer
like Vigoro Plant Starter until the roots become established, then
switch to a high nitrogen formulation which encourages green growth
(Vigoro Tree and Shrub Fertilizer or Instant Vigoro 30-10-10
Evergreen, Cedar and Shrub Food will work just  fine).<br>
<br>
Give ground covers a try this year. Down the road, you'll be
rewarded by rich, healthy greens, sprinkled with blue (periwinkle),
white (pachysandra, cotoneaster, lily-of-the-valley), pink
(creeping phlox, stonecrop) and other colourful flowers in the
spring. Summer will bring cool, shade-dappled sweeps of varying 
greens. Some, like cotoneaster get red or white berries later in
the season... and many are evergreen, providing year-round
enjoyment. <br>
<br>
Whatever kind of ground cover you choose... the result is worth
waiting  for. Your extra effort in the early years will be rewarded
with a long-lasting, low maintenance landscape that might be the
envy of the neighbourhood.

<h1>Organic growing: An old idea,<br>
 but a good one</h1>
<h2>Today's gardener has many options<br>
 to help mother nature</h2>
<img src="gard2.gif">
</center>
<br>
Many of the new materials we have available to us as gardeners are
the result of advances made in the field of agriculture. In the
past 100 years, the world's 
farmers have been faced with the challenge of feeding a growing
global population, at the same time as urban development has
reduced the amount of land available for growing crops.<br>
<br>
To meet the challenge, farmers had to find a way to get more food
out of fewer acres. They've succeeded, by using technology to its
fullest. Tractors replaced horses, and machinery and chemicals
replaced a great deal of backbreaking labour. Many of these
advances were also adopted by home gardeners.<br>
<br>
<b>A look at growing things... before  20th century 
technology</b><br>
<br>
In 1881, an Ontario Agricultural Commission reviewed some of the
methods farmers were using to improve crop yields. Even back then,
growers knew they had to keep replenishing the nutrients in the
soil, or crop yields and quality would 
eventually dwindle.<br>
<br>
Many farmers were looking at ways to use manure more 
effectively. Some of the more innovative farmers  were even
experimenting with natural resources such as gypsum, bone dust and
phosphates, which all showed promising yield-
enhancing ability.<br>
<br>
Issues such as chemical residue in produce, ground water 
contamination and soil depletion were a long way in the future.<br>
<br>
<b>A lot changed in just 100 years... but a lot remains the same</b><br>
<br>
Now, many farmers and gardeners are taking a step back, and 
re-examining early growing practices. Some are willing to trade a
little yield for a different kind of crop quality; one that's also
good for the health of the consumer, the soil and the environment.<br>
<br>
<b>Growing organically, without  losing what we've learned</b><br>
<br>
Modern agriculture has brought many scientific advances that are of
tremendous value, even for organic growing. For example, we can now
predict quite accurately which nutrients various plants will need
in order to maintain healthy growth. The primary ones are <b><em>Nitrogen</em></b>
which encourages green plant growth, <b><em>Phosphorus</em></b> which is used by
plants to produce strong roots and boosts flower, fruit and
vegetable production, and <b><em>Potassium</em></b> which increases overall plant
strength, disease resistance and hardiness. Other minor 
nutrients (like iron, magnesium, zinc and copper) are also
important for balanced growth; a shortage of just one essential
nutrient can severely restrict plant growth.<br>
<br>
A simple soil test tells how much of these nutrients is available
in the garden soil. It's then just a matter of adding any extra 
nutrients required to maintain healthy, balanced plant growth.
Often, these  needs can be met with organic fertilizers.<br>
<br>
<b>Today's organic fertilizer choices</b><br>
<br>
When many gardeners think of organic fertilizers, they think of
<b><em>manure</em></b>. But while manure is very good for improving soil texture
and organic content, it often lacks the essential nutrients plants
need.<br>
<br>
<b><em>Compost</em></b> is excellent for 
improving the organic content of the soil, and contributes valuable
nutrients. Use compost as much as you can.<br>
<br>
Excellent quality <b><em>organic 
fertilizers</em></b> are also available from many lawn and garden centers.
The Canagro line is one example: It offers natural ingredients like
bone meal, gypsum, kelp meal, and blood meal that have been proven
to meet the nutritional needs of growing plants.<br>
<br>
Don't overlook <b><em>"conventional"  fertilizers</em></b> in your search for
organic plant nutrition. Some of these, such as the Golden Vigoro
line, are formulated in an organic base, and contain higher levels
of Nitrogen needed by growing lawns. Avoid brands that contain high
levels of rock filler or sewage sludge.

<h1>Rock Gardens</h1>
<h2>Take a few tips from mother nature.</h2>
<img src="rockg.gif">
</center>
<br>
The rock garden can make a beautiful anchor for a landscape plan,
or enhance the effect of a backyard water 
garden. The best rock gardens are the most natural looking ones. If
you can, take the time to see how Mother Nature places rocks around
a stream bed or rocky landscape:<br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="greenball.gif"> Larger rocks are on lower levels<br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="greenball.gif">There are rocks of many 
different sizes, but usually with a similar texture and colour. <br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="greenball.gif"> Rocks lying on the earth are usually sitting on their most stable
side, with a good 
portion buried in the ground.<br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="greenball.gif"> The rocks are placed in 
random groupings, large and small, with a few sitting alone.
They're not evenly spaced.<br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="greenball.gif"> Plants are clustered among the rocks informally.<br>
<br>
Try to design your own rock 
garden to follow these examples, or ask you garden center for
assistance (Many even sell and install rocks). On steeply sloping
areas, you may want to consider terracing; breaking the garden into
two or more levels with stone retaining walls that will prevent
erosion and allow the use of some trailing plants, or even a multi-
level waterfall.<br>
<br>
Move the rocks around until they "feel right" and look as if they
had been there a while. Dig them in a bit. If you want, place some
flat rocks into the soil to use as steps or platforms to garden
from. And of course, leave space here and there for plants. <br>
<br>
Make sure the soil bed is in good shape around the rocks when
you've finished positioning them. You should have several inches
depth of good, well-drained loamy soil. If in doubt, dig in some
high-organic topsoil, compost, peat moss or well-rotted manure. You
want to avoid having to add to the soil levels after you've
finished most of the planting.<br>
<br>
When you're ready to install plants, use nature's example again.
Use small groupings with more than one of each type of plant. Use
contrasting plants that look good together. It's a good idea to
plan your garden out on paper, noting the relative height of the
plants you plan to buy, where they fit and what the light
availability is. Take the plan along to your garden centre...
you'll be able to choose plants with more confidence, get an
opinion from garden center staff if you need it, and you should be
able to save money by passing up plants that aren't a good fit.<br>
<br>
Consider some ornamental grasses mixed with perennial flowers,
annuals or wildflowers. Low-growing mosses and ground covers
usually look good growing among rocks, and many will thrive growing
in small holes or crevices. Avoid vines or creepers that might
completely obscure the rocks, unless you're prepared to do some
regular pruning.<br>
<br>
Once established, most rock gardens require little maintenance...
just move a plant now and then if it outgrows its neighbours, or
install some annuals to fill a space until the surrounding
perennials mature.<br>
<br>
Regular feeding with a top quality organic-based garden fertilizer
like PINK Vigoro will help keep the rock garden plants in top
condition, year after year.

<title>The Vegetable Garden</title>
</header>
<body bgcolor="FFFFFF">
<body>
<center><img src="vigsmall.gif"><hr>
<h1>The Vegetable Garden</h1>
<h2>The right plan leads to more good tastes,<br>
less food waste.</h2>
<img src="veg.gif">
</center>
<br>
Home grown produce just seems to taste better... and there's a
reason. Corn, beans, peas, tomatoes and other vegetables taste best
when they're fresh-picked. Store-bought 
vegetables often have to be picked days ahead of when they appear
on the produce shelves, and sometimes that means they're picked a
little greener, and allowed to "ripen" in transit. With your own 
vegetable garden, you can pick them when they're at the peak of
perfection. Yum!<br>
<br>
The best vegetable gardens start with two solid foundations: good
soil and a good plan.<br>
<br>
Your soil can be improved by ensuring there is good drainage, and
lots of organic matter present. Compost is one of the best soil
improvers you can possibly find. If you're not already composting,
start soon. It,s a great use for food scraps (except for meats and
dairy products) and an ideal way to "recycle" leaves, grass
clippings and garden vegetation. If you don't have compost, try
mixing some peat moss or well-rotted manure into the garden.<br>
<br>
Take the time to measure your garden area, and draw it out on
paper. That way, when you're at the garden center, standing in
front of the seed packet 
display, you won't be tempted to pick and choose like you would at
the salad bar. This approach is a recipe for 
frustration.<br>
<br>
<b>Here are a few things to 
consider when laying out your garden:</b><br>
<br>
1. Relate choices and number of plants to timing. A dozen heads of
lettuce may not sound like a lot, but it is if they're all ready on
the same day. If you need more, consider earlier and a later-
maturing varieties. You could also plant the same 
variety at one or two-week intervals. Just make sure they will have
time to mature before frost is likely.<br>
<br>
2. Plant vegetables your family will enjoy eating. (ie. you can
probably get Junior to weed the peas more easily than the turnips,
if you're making the 
garden a family project).<br>
<br>
3. Make sure you allow enough room for each type of vegetable to
get the light it needs, and grow to the full size. Once the risk of
spring frost has passed, you can  plant seeds or transplant
directly into the 
garden. Or if you prefer, you can start them indoors in containers
and then transplant.<br>
<br>
Once the soil has warmed up (later in the spring) it's a good idea
to mulch around the plants to conserve moisture and 
prevent weed growth. Use straw, sawdust, leaves, bark or manure.
Another option is to lay plastic film or paper on the ground, and
poke holes through it for your vegetable plants.<br>
<br>
Once the garden is established, it will benefit from regular
weeding, watering and feeding. Use a good quality fertilizer like
PINK Vigoro, Instant Vigoro Water-soluble Vegetable Food or Vigoro
Granular Vegetable Food.<br>
<br>
You'll have to keep a constant watch for all kinds of pests, too.
All kinds of critters, from rabbits to insects will want to help
you enjoy the garden. Fences will keep out the larger types, while
a variety of options are available for insects. If you can, control
insects by picking them off by hand or use a mild insecticidal
soap. More toxic insecticides should be avoided wherever 
possible on food crops. If you do use them, follow label directions
carefully.<br>
<br>
Good luck with your vegetable garden this year. And if you do have
good luck... bon appetit!

<B>The Goal of the End User</B>
<p>
The goal of all end users is the maintenance of a safe, clear
surface for people and vehicles.
<P>
This may be expanded to include the effects on concrete,
vegetation, metal surfaces, and the persons who must apply the
ice melter. While products are available which address every concern,
fiscal limitations may ultimately force the end user to prioritize
them.
<P>
A critical step in the maintenance of a safe surface is a
plan for ice melter application and snow removal. The plan should
be formulated prior to the first snow fall, addressing pedestrian
and vehicle safety, concrete and vegetation damage, worker safety,
corrosion, and any other critical issues.
<P>
<B>Snow removal and surface maintenance plans are discussed
in detail in</B> <I>The Snow Removal Plan. </I>Practical planning
usually involves a combination of a granular ice melter and the
physical removal of ice, snow, or slush. For example. a typical
situation involves a thick, compressed layer of ice or snow. The
use of any ice melter to completely dissolve the layer is not
only cost prohibitive, it may also prove environmentally damaging.
Instead. a granular ice melter should be applied to penetrate
the layer in order to break the bond between the ice and pavement.
Once this is accomplished, the remaining ice and snow can easily
be removed by physical means.

A common question from end users is, &quot;We just had a snow
storm and I want to know; how much ice melter I should put down?&quot;
<P>
The table above lists general application strategies which achieve
the best results.
<P>
This is not easily answered because application rates depends
on many factors, the most important of which is the type of precipitation.
Manufacturers are responsible for recommending application rates 
that are effective for a variety of conditions.
<P>
Unfortunately, application rates are sometimes used for marketing
purposes and not to achieve the best results. Statements like,
&quot;My ice melter only requires half as much as my competitors
so it lasts twice as long,&quot; are common even though following
the recommended rate may not effectively melt ice. Be wary of
manufacturers who promote application rates that do not yield effective
results. Their application instructions may contradict marketing
claims.
<P>
<I>Pre-applications</I>
<P>
Spreading ice melter before precipitation begins maximizes a deicer's
effectiveness by starting the melting process early and preventing
the formation of an ice-to-surface bond.
<P>
Preventing the bond formation can significantly simplify shoveling
or plowing. However, if large accumulations are expected and shoveling
or plowing does not occur, pre-application may cause a brine to
form under the snow pack which can refreeze and is difficult to
remove.
<center>
<h1>Planning Ahead</h1>
<img src="plan.gif">
</center>
Plans for snow plowing and the maintenance of clear surfaces should
be part of a complete winter maintenance program. Here are some
general guidelines.
<P>
Prior to snow fall, set the boundaries in which snow removal operations
will occur, marking all curbs, light fixtures, landscaped areas,
fences railings, etc. In addition, list priorities for snow removal,
focusing first on walkways, driveways and parking areas for the
safety of pedestrians.
<P>
Designate the amount of snowfall necessary before removal should
begin. Determine snow removal guidelines, plowing direction and
areas for snow piling.
<P>
To maximize effectiveness and prevent ice-surface bonding, apply
ice melter prior to precipitation. This will facilitate easy removal
by plowing or other means.
<P>
When snowfall occurs during evening hours or overnight, indicate
by what time all parking lots should be cleared. If the snowfall
exceeds the predetermined accumulation point, set follow-up removal
to take place within eight hours or prior to a set time. Upon
completion of work, all areas should be plowed to specification,
usually no more than one-half inch of snow should be remaining.
Ice melter should be reapplied to all surfaces to melt remaining
ice and snow, provide immediate traction and prevent refreezing.

<title>Common Ice Melter Ingredients</title>
</header>
<body bgcolor="FFFFFF">
<center><img src="vigsmall.gif"><img src="coldfact.gif"><hr>
<h1>Common Ice Melter Ingredients</h1>
</center>
<b>Introduction</b>
<P>
Most ice melting products can be categorized as pure or blended.
Pure products are comprised of a single ingredient, simple blends
are made from a combination of ingredients. Even though they contain
multiple ingredients, simple blends will typically only perform
as well as their primary component. For instance, simple blends
comprised of 90% rock salt will perform similar to straight rock
salt. The exception is a true manufactured ice melter that combines
multiple ingredients on the same granule. When done correctly,
true synergy occurs and performance can be significantly enhanced.
<P>
The following is an analysis of common ice melter ingredients.
<P>
<b><I>Rock Salt (NaCl, Salt, Halite)</I></b>
<br>
Rock salt is mined from deposits throughout the world and is considered
a commodity product. Salt has an effective melting temperature
that ranges between 5&#186;F to 10&#186;F and can damage vegetation
in concentrated form. Salt crystals vary in appearance according
to the source. For instance, road control salt may have dark crystals,
up to a 1&quot; in diameter and frequently contains impurities
such as rocks or shale. Fines, at the other end of the size spectrum,
approach the size of table salt.
<P>
<b><I>Calcium Chloride (MgCl2)</I></b>
<br>
Many end users prefer calcium chloride because it works quickly
while others avoid it because of its side effects. Calcium chloride
can be derived from calcium carbonate and hydrochloric acid or
dried from calcium chloride brine in the form of prills or flakes.
<P>
Calcium chloride attracts moisture (hygroscopic) and releases
heat (exothermic) as it undergoes a chemical reaction. Its reactive
nature allows calcium chloride to effectively melt to -25&#186;F,
but can also seriously effect human health, concrete, carpets,
and vegetation. In fact, calcium chloride material safety data
sheets often require the use of masks, gloves and goggles.
<P>
Calcium chloride can also leave a clear, greasy residue that is
difficult to remove and can increase surface slipperiness, attract
dirt, stain, or attack floor finishes. It tends to refreeze quickly
and may require frequent applications. In addition, its hygroscopic
nature may cause it to liquefy, clump or harden during storage.
<P>
<b><I>Potassium Chloride (KCl) Potash </I></b>
<br>
Potassium chloride is a
common plant nutrient used to promote plant hardiness and disease
resistance. It commonly takes the form of red or white granules.
The red grade comes from traditional shaft mines and gets it s
color from iron oxide (rust) contamination. The white grade is
solution mined which yields a refined pure white crystal. Potassium
chloride has an effective melting temperature of 15&#186;F, making
pure potassium chloride impractical unless used in conjunction
with other ingredients.
<P>
For more information, about the effects of granule size on melting,
see <I>The Importance of Particle Size.</I>
<p>
<b><I>Urea</I></b>
<br>
Urea, derived from atmospheric nitrogen gas, is a common fertilizer
nutrient that promotes deep green foliage color. In its pure form
urea is completely non-corrosive making it a good choice for use
around the metals and exotic alloys of electrical substations
and airplanes. In fact, the F.A.A. requires that urea meet strict
contamination regulations before being approved to use at airports.
However, the urea marketed most frequently as an ice melter is
considered an agricultural grade is not suitable for use in corrosion
sensitive environments. Urea is effective above 20&#186;F.
<P>
<b><I>Magnesium Chloride (MgCI2)</I></b>
<br>
Magnesium chloride can be manufactured or extracted from naturally
occurring brines like the Great Salt Lake and Dead Sea. Trace
amounts can also be found in salt deposits. Magnesium chloride
attracts moisture (hygroscopic) and releases heat (exothermic)
as it undergoes a chemical reaction. Its reactive nature allows
magnesium chloride to effectively melt at low temperatures but
can also affect human health, concrete, carpets, and vegetation.
In fact, magnesium chloride material safety data sheets often
require the use of masks, gloves and goggles.
<P>
Magnesium chloride can also leave a clear, greasy residue that
is difficult to remove, can increase surface slipperiness, attract
dirt, stain, or attack floor finishes. It tends to refreeze quickly
and may require frequent applications. In addition, its hygroscopic
nature may cause it to liquefy, clump or harden during storage.
<P>
<b><I>Ammonium Sulphate</I>
<I>([NH4]2SO4)</I></b>
<br>
Ammonium sulphate is a fertilizer ingredient that is infrequently
used in ice melter. It comes in a prill form and is effective
to 20&#186;F.
<P>
Ammonium Sulphate will attack concrete and is not recommended
for use on concrete surfaces. It is also hygroscopic and can clump
or harden as it absorbs moisture.
<P>
<b><I>Calcium Magnesium Acetate (CMA)  </i></b>
<br>
CMA was developed as an environmentally responsible alternative
to road salt. It is the safest of all ice melters in regards to
vegetation, concrete, water tables, and end users. CMA is non-corrosive,
biodegradable and can effectively prevent the formation of ice-surface
bonds when applied prior to precipitation. Research even suggests
that CMA's coating action reduces the risk of moisture penetration
and surface damage. CMA's expense, more than 30 times that of
rock salt, and its melting temperature of 15&#186;F have limited
its practical use.
<P>
Pure CMA is applied in critical areas where corrosion, vegetation,
or water contamination is a primary concern. When blended with
other ingredients, CMA can significantly reduce the risk of corrosion
and surface damage. In fact, government tests have found that
a minimum of 20% CMA can reduce corrosion and concrete damage
by as much as 80%. But caution is advised when purchasing CMA
blends that claim CMA's benefits but only use <U><I>trace</I></U>
amounts.
<p>
<b><I>MG-104 (Alpha Methyl Glucoside)</I></B>
<br>
MG-104 is a corn by-product that is most effective when combined
with other ingredients. When formulated properly, MG-104 can provide
a catalytic affect that speeds melting, lowers effective melting
temperature, and assists in the extension of freeze-thaw cycles
(surface damage).
<P>
<b><I>Potassium Acetate</I></b>
<br>
Potassium acetate is a biodegradable liquid deicer whose concentration
can be varied. It is commonly applied with bulk sprayers and tanker
trucks and is primarily used for airports. It has also been used
as a prewetting agent for sand and salt. Because potassium acetate
is corrosive it is often mixed with a corrosion inhibitor.
<P>
<b><I>Ethylene Glycol</I></b>
<br>
Ethylene glycol is a liquid deicer of varying concentration. It
is commonly mixed with liquid urea and applied using bulk sprayers
and tanker trucks applied primarily at airports. It is non-corrosive
but poses environmental hazards, especially to grass, animals
and water tables.
<P>
<b><I>Corrosion Inhibitors</I></b>
<br>
While ice melters containing chlorides may be effective and economical,
they will also corrode metal surfaces. Some manufacturers have
added corrosion inhibitors with limited success.
<P>
Failure to effectively prevent corrosion is mainly due to the
way products are produced. In a blended product, for instance,
ingredients are separated when applied to a surface. Because inhibitors
have no significant melting action, they may not dissolve into
the brine solution where corrosion occurs.
<P>
End users are cautioned when reviewing inhibitor claims based
on standard corrosion tests. The results may not be achievable
outside a lab. To assure complete corrosion prevention, FM approved
urea or pure CMA should be used.
<P>
<b><I>Simple Blends</I></b>
<br>
Because many of today's ice melters are not comprised of just
one ingredient, it is worth discussing ways in which products
are produced. As the name implies, products that are simply blended
contain granules of different ingredients in the same bag. End
users can be misled into believing they are buying a manufactured
product with multiple ingredients on one granule. They also frequently
assume they are receiving a balance of ingredients when, in fact,
most products contain more than 95% rock salt.
<P>
The unfortunate reality is that most blends are formulated for
maximum manufacturer's profits and not performance. The end user
must be wary of unscrupulous manufacturers with false performance
claims. If a simple blend is comprised of more than 90% of a single
ingredient, its performance is dictated by that ingredient. It
is unrealistic to believe that trace amounts of secondary ingredients
will significantly affect performance.

<title>Cold Facts History</title>
</header>
<body bgcolor="FFFFFF">
<center><img src="vigsmall.gif"><img src="coldfact.gif"><hr>
<h1>Cold Facts History</h1>
</center>
The history of the ice melter industry parallels the popularity
of the automobile. As cars and trucks became the center of leisure and
commerce, the maintaining of safe road ways gained importance. Municipalities
responded to winter conditions by spreading sand on roadways for increased
traction.
<P>
In many instances sand alone was not effective, leading to the
combining of sand and rock salt. This too met with limited success until eventually,
straight rock salt became the ice melter industry. Soon other ingredients
with melting properties began to gain popularity, offering more choices to
professionals and consumers. In the 1980's, new safety regulations, liability risks
and complex environmental issues contributed to rapid changes in the industry.
<P>
Demand for better performance began to drive research into value-added
products utilizing better ingredients and improved manufacturing
techniques. Today the ice melter market is being bombarded with
an avalanche of new brands. While almost all claim to be value-added,
most are copies of existing products or simple re-mixes of commodity
ingredients with no discernible performance improvements. The increased
competition, has also driven manufacturers to exaggerate claims
and product features resulting in new levels of consumer confusion
and mistrust that may only be corrected by voluntary industry
standards or forced government regulations.
<P>
This manual addresses these and other issues important to professionals
and consumers by:
<P>
1) exploring aspects of performance and
<P>
2) discussing individual ingredients.
<P>
It is designed as a reference with easy to understand sections
that may be used individually or collectively. You may find it
useful to first skim the outline, referring to detailed explanations
when needed.

<h1>Lawn Care Products</h1>
</center>
<br>
When it comes to keeping a lawn in top shape, you just can't beat the
Golden Vigoro line of quality lawn fertilizers. Each formulation contains
only top quality ingredients, scientifically blended to meet specific lawn
requirements during the growing season.<br>
<br>
But there's one nutritional element that sets the Golden Vigoro line apart
from all others:  <b>IBDU controlled-release nitrogen.</b><br>
<br>
Quite simply, no other product can deliver Nitrogen to the lawn in a more
controlled, long-lasting form. The unique character of IBDU nitrogen is
due to the fact that its release is based on hydrolysis:  water is the key
element that triggers nitrogen release. However, IBDU is 1000 times less
soluble than normal nitrogen sources - so regardless of the amount of water
present, IBDU delivers consistent feeding over a 10 to 12 week period. Even
compared to other slow-release nitrogen sources such as Sulphur Coated
Urea, IBDU delivers more consistent, longer lasting nutrition. The result
is an even, healthy looking lawn, with very low risk of excess nitrogen
leaching prematurely out of the lawn into ground water systems.<br>
<br>
All Golden Vigoro Lawn Fertilizers (except 0-0-0 Crabgrass Preventer) are
formulated with a natural organic base. And the uniform particle size makes
spreading easy and accurate. Golden Vigoro Lawn Fertilizers with IBDU:

<h1>All-Organic Natural Products</h1>
</center>
In 1993, Vigoro acquired the Canagro line of high quality organic
fertilizers. Developed in response to consumer demand for an "all-natural"
alternative in lawn and garden nutrition, Canagro products quickly became
Canada's leader in natural fertilizers. The line includes a range of true
organic substances that are homogenous (not blended) and designed to
deliver results in many growing situations.<br>
<br>
<b>Canagro Nature's Fertilizer 8-4-4</b><br>
An all-natural premium slow-release nitrogen fertilizer, 8-4-4 is excellent
for lawns and vegetable gardens. It will provide for good initial growth
and meet long-term plant
nutritional requirements. Available in 8kg and 18kg bags.<br>
<br>
<b>Canagro Nature's Fertilizer 5-4-7</b><br>
A premium all-natural fertilizer for flowers and vegetables, 5-4-7 can also
be used on lawns. Its high magnesium content helps neutralize acidity and
has been proven effective in preventing tree die-back. Available in 1, 2, 8
and 18kg sizes.<br>
<br>
<b>Canagro Tree and Lawn Fertilizer 4-4-8</b><br>
A dual-purpose fall lawn fertilizer and tree/shrub fertilizer, this bone
and blood meal-based organic product has a high potash component to help
plants stay healthy through high-stress conditions. Available in 2, 8 and
18kg sizes.<br>
<br>
<b>Canagro Bonemeal 2-14-0</b><br>
Long recognized as an excellent fertilizer, the natural phosphorous in
bonemeal is especially good for bulbs, roses, evergreens and shrubs. As it
promotes strong root development, bonemeal is also recommended for starting
new plants. Canagro bonemeal is of exceptionally high quality. The bone is
steamed to remove excess fat and meat protein which could damage plants.
Then the bone is reduced to powder and pelletized, so it is in a form
readily available to the plant. Available in 2, 4, 8 and 18kg sizes.<br>
<br>
<b>Canagro Bone and Bloodmeal 7-11-0</b><br>
An excellent source of nitrogen and phosphorous for flowers, bulbs,
vegetables and shrubs. Available in 1, 2, 4, 8 and 18kg sizes.<br>
<br>
<b>Canagro Bloodmeal 12-0-0</b><br>
Bloodmeal is a completely natural slow-release source of nitrogen. It is
excellent for use on leafy and green vegetables such as lettuce and corn,
and can be applied throughout the growing period. Available in 1.5kg box.<br>
<br>
<b>Canagro Soil Conditioners</b><br>
<EM>Canagro Gypsum provides</EM> calcium and sulfur to the soil. It also helps break
up clays and removes harmful salts from the soil. Available in 8 and 18kg
sizes.<br>
<br>
<EM>Canagro Dolomitic Limestone</EM> provides calcium and magnesium to the soil and
is best known for it's ability to "sweeten" acid soils. Unlike some
"chipped" limestone products, Canagro Limestone is ground to a very fine
powder, then made into a granulated form which is easy to handle and
readily available to plants. Helps improve soil structure. Available in 2,
8 and 18kg sizes.<br>
<br>
<b>Canagro Specialty Fertilizers</b><br>
<em>Canagro Compost Aid 5-2-3</em> helps to enhance both the composting process and provides balanced nutrition to the finished product. It is all natural and contains many mircronutrients, as well as gypsum which is a natural odour controller. Available in 1 kg.<br>
<br>
<em>Canagro Kelpmeal</em> is a high quality natural source of many micro-nutrients. Its high organic matter content improves soil structure. Available in 2kg carton.<br>
<br>
<em>Canagro Rose Food 5-3-8</em> provides balanced nutrition for all types of roses. All ingredients are natural to provide for optimum health, vigour and colour. Available in 2kg.<br>

<br>
<b>Instant Vigoro Tomato Vegetable Food 18-18-21</b><br>

<br>
<b>Instant Vigoro All-Purpose Fertilizer 20-20-20</b><br>

<h1>L'histoire Vigoro</h1>
</center>
<P>
Vigoro a fait ses d&eacute;buts dans le domaine de la nutrition
des plantes au Canada, il y a d&eacute;j&agrave; bien des ann&eacute;es.
Au fait, c'&eacute;tait en 1902. D&egrave;s le tout d&eacute;but,
la compagnie jouissait d'une excellente r&eacute;putation pour
ses produits de premi&egrave;re qualit&eacute;, con&ccedil;us
pour les besoins individuels du march&eacute;.
<P>
Plusieurs de ces produits furent de vraies innovations qui contribu&egrave;rent
de fa&ccedil;on importante au march&eacute; de soin de pelouse
et de jardin d'aujourd'hui au Canada.
<P>
Par exemple, en 1924, quand Vigoro &eacute;tait connu sous le
nom de Swift Canada Co., il lan&ccedil;a le premier engrais pour
pelouse et jardin &agrave; usage domestique au Canada, avec oligo-&eacute;l&eacute;ments
pour un r&eacute;gime de nutrition des plantes tout &agrave; fait
&eacute;quilibr&eacute;.
<P>
En 1954, Vigoro lan&ccedil;a le premier engrais pour pelouse &agrave;
effet non-br&ucirc;lant...une formulation d'azote &agrave; lib&eacute;ration
lente; le r&eacute;sultat, une pelouse plus saine avec moins d'applications
d'engrais. Ceci marqua un pas en avant et le reste de l'industrie
suivit de tr&egrave;s pr&egrave;s.
<P>
1968 a marqu&eacute; un autre &eacute;v&eacute;nement principal
pour Vigoro, avec l'introduction de l'agent IBDU&#174; (l'isobutylid&egrave;ne
diurea) l'azote &agrave; lib&eacute;ration contr&ocirc;l&eacute;e.
25 ans apr&egrave;s son introduction, ce produit est toujours
sans &eacute;gal quand il s'agit d'offrir une lib&eacute;ration
uniforme d'&eacute;l&eacute;ments nutritifs durant une p&eacute;riode
de temps prolong&eacute;e.
<P>
Au cours des ann&eacute;es, un seul produit symbolisa l'image
de nutrition des plantes de qualit&eacute; sup&eacute;rieure avant
tout autre: Vigoro Ros&eacute;. Reconnu, il y a 40 ans, en tant
que l'engrais de jardin dominant, &quot;Ros&eacute;&quot; conna&icirc;t
toujours cette m&ecirc;me r&eacute;putation aujourd'hui.
<P>
Au cours des ann&eacute;es, la ligne de produits s'est d&eacute;velopp&eacute;e
pour comprendre une gamme compl&egrave;te de produits de consommation
con&ccedil;us pour les besoins d'un march&eacute; de jardinage
en voie de d&eacute;veloppement.<br>

Winter time presents a number of hazards  
including walking on icy sidewalks,       
spinning tire wheels on slippery driveways
or climbing icy steps. Vigoro has the answer to         
reducing these safety risks...Vigoro Ice Melter and     
Traction Aid.                                           
<p>

traction along with potassium chloride    
to melt icy patches. Vigoro Ice Melter

<title>The Melting Process</title>
</header>
<body bgcolor="FFFFFF">
<center><img src="vigsmall.gif"><img src="coldfact.gif"><hr>
<h1>The Melting Process</h1>
</center>
<P>
<img src="melt1.gif" align="left"> A granular ice melter begins to form a brine solution upon contact
with ice or snow. The brine solution, through continued dissolving of ice and snow,
drives the melting process. The ability of the brine to effectively
melt ice and snow is limited by its concentration (the amount
of ice melter dissolved in the brine).
<P>
<img src="melt2.gif" align="left"> It is the presence of dissolved materials that lowers, or depresses,
the temperature at which the solution will freeze.  Generally,
the greater the concentration of dissolved materials, the lower
the freezing point. When ice melter is initially spread, it forms
a strong, concentrated brine solution.
<P>
<img src="melt3.gif" align="left"> As melting continues, the brine becomes dilute, the
concentration decreases, and the brine may likely refreeze.
<P>
 Consider pure water, which freezes at 32&#186;F or O&#186;C.
 Ocean water, conversely, with a concentration of 2% salt freezes
at 27&#186;F or -3&#186;C. If the air temperature is 29&#186;F,
-2&#186;C, a glass of sea water will not freeze. If fresh water
is added it will dilute the solution and refreezing will begin.
The same process occurs as an ice melter dissolves a layer of
ice.
<P>
 Some ice melters use exothermic ingredients that release heat
as they chemically react with water. The release of heat assists
in the initial formation of the brine solution especially at lower
temperatures. However, it does very little direct melting and
is not long lasting. The most important melting factor continues
to be the maintaining of a brine solution and not the release
of heat.
<P>
 In addition, exothermic materials tend to require high brine
concentrations to keep from refreezing. Ingredients like calcium
and magnesium chlorides can dramatically lose effectiveness as
they become dilute. When this happens, additional material may
be required in order to prevent the brine solution from refreezing.
<P>
<center><img src="tempcurv.gif"></center>
<p>
 The above chart shows how temperature and concentration determine
when a brine will refreeze. It is important to note that the use
of different ingredients affect solutions differently. At a concentration
of 10%, one product may have a refreeze point of -2&#186;F while
another will refreeze at 7&#186;F. The ability of any ingredient
to prevent a brine solution from freezing determines its effectiveness
as an ice melter.

<h1>Effective Melting Temperature</h1>
<img src="hot.gif">
</center>
<P>
 The <I>Effective Melting Temperature </I>is commonly used
to compare different ice melting products. The effective melting
temperature defines the lowest point at which an ice melter will
<I>realistically </I>melt.
<P>
 A true effective melting temperature should be derived from
independent testing that accounts for performance under a variety
of conditions. Discussions on the following pages address
the major factors (ice thickness, humidity, type of ice, granule
size, etc.) that influence the effective melting temperature.
With so many variables and a lack of testing standards, it
is easy to see how a manufacturer can publish unproven or even
misleading claims.
<P>
 For example. a manufacturer of a urea product claims an effective
melting temperature down to -50&#186; F, well below the industry
accepted range of 20&#186; F to 25&#186;F.
<P>
 In another example, a large calcium chloride producer even
claims that they manufacture the only product to melt effectively
below 2O&#186;F!
<P>
 With so many conflicting claims, buyers must rely on common
sense and past experience to avoid unscrupulous manufacturers.
Asking questions about product composition can quickly dispel
misleading claims.<p>
<center><img src="ingred.gif"></center>
<p>
For example, a manufacturer producing a simple blend with
a high               concentration of sodium chloride should not
claim performance much better than that of salt.

<title>Melting Speed and Ended Melting</title>
</header>
<body bgcolor="FFFFFF">
<center><img src="vigsmall.gif"><img src="coldfact.gif"><hr>
<h1>Melting Speed and Ended Melting</h1>
</center>
Melting speed or rate of melting and extended melting are two
criteria used to compare ice melter performance. The rate of melting
is limited by the environmental conditions and the nature of the
ingredients used. For example, ingredients that chemically react
with moisture tend to melt quickly. However, falling temperatures
reduce the melting speed of all ingredients. If temperatures drop
low enough, the melting action ceases almost completely and the
ice melter is ineffective. This threshold is referred to as <I>the
Effective Melting Temperature.</I>
<pre>
        <img src="meltcurv.gif">                <img src="lifecurv.gif">
</Pre>
Often, compounds are classified as having extended melting based
on their ability to continue melting/resist refreezing. As a general
rule, ice melters that start melting quickly tend to stop melting
quickly and often require frequent applications to prevent refreezing.
Those that provide a steady, prolonged melting action effectively
de-ice larger volumes and tend to be more economical.
<P>
Some manufacturers claim that their products offer the benefits
of both quick starting and steady melting. A check of the ingredients
and manufacturing technique used will suggest how effective the
ice melter is at achieving both.
<P>
Typically, products will only perform as well as their primary
ingredient. Simple blends consisting of two or more types of ingredients
in the same bag will not perform as well as multiple ingredients
on the same granule.
<P>

extended melting see <a href="mprocess.html"><I>The Melting Process, The Importance of
Particle Size,</a></I> and <a href="humid.html"><I>The Effects of Temperature and Humidity.</I></a>

</pre>
Most end users assume when they purchase an ice melter, that they
are buying a quality product made from quality ingredients. This
is not always the case. When ingredients come from a mine, they
are separated by size ranging from table salt to marbles. Manufactured
granules like calcium chloride can range from large prills (spheres)
to shavings or flakes. To achieve a consistent appearance and
performance, raw materials must be properly sized and purified.
Cutting corners by accepting improperly sized and off-spec materials
results in decreased performance.
<P>
Size and the amount of surface area directly impact the melting
process. Smaller granules and flakes have greater total surface
area resulting in more contact with ice or snow compared to larger
granules. This allows small granules to melt quickly. But, as
seen in the illustration above, small granules may completely
dissolve before they penetrate an ice layer. This results
<P>
in the formation of brine on top of ice which could refreeze,
creating an even slicker and more dangerous surface.
<P>
Larger particles have less surface area and a comparatively slower
melting action. They will penetrate an ice layer, but may not
completely dissolve or effectively form an underlying brine layer.
The result is unused materials that reduces melting efficiency
and increases costs.
<P>
The most effective and efficient ice melters use consistent and
medium sized granules. This size allows the granules to bore through
the surface, while maximizing the formation of brine. The result
is the breaking of the ice-to-surface bond which allows for easy
removal of remaining ice.

<center><img src="vigsmall.gif"><img src="coldfact.gif"><hr>
<h1>Effects of Temperature and Humidity</h1>
</center>
<img src="humid.gif" align="left">
<I>Temperature </I>is a measure of energy commonly expressed as
surface temperature, air temperature, and wind chill. The presence
or absence of energy greatly affects the melting process. Ice
melters are more effective at higher temperatures. As the temperature,
or energy levels fall, the effectiveness of an ice melter decreases.
<P>
For instance, an end user will see quicker results when spreading
rock salt at 25&#186;F than at O&#186;F.
<P>
Some ice melters use exothermic ingredients that release heat
as they chemically react with water.  While the release of heat
can assist in the initial formation of brine it does very little
direct melting and is not long lasting. Additionally, exothermic
materials tend to refreeze quickly, requiring more frequent applications
to maintain effectiveness.
<P>
<I>Humidity, </I>or the level of moisture in the air, tends to
decrease as temperatures fall. This is why winter is associated
with very cold dry air that dries skin and chaps lips. Precipitation
is directly related to the amount of moisture in the air which
is why snow tends to fall above 20&#186;F to 25&#186;F.
<P>
As temperatures fall, humidity decreases making ice and snow much
less likely to form. For this reason, products that melt at extremely
low temperatures may offer no real advantage over those that melt
at somewhat higher temperatures.
<P>
Humidity can also affect ice melter integrity. Exothermic ingredients,
like calcium and magnesium chlorides, are also hygroscopic or
moisture absorbing. Products
formulated with these ingredients can absorb moisture when exposed
to humid air or even through packaging. Inventories should be
frequently checked for caking, clumping, or complete hardening.
Care should also be taken when choosing where to store hygroscopic
materials as they may liquefy, seeping through packaging and staining
carpets or concrete surfaces.

<title>Effects on Vegetation</title>
</header>
<body bgcolor="FFFFFF">
<center><img src="vigsmall.gif"><img src="coldfact.gif"><hr>
<h1>Effects on Vegetation</h1>
</center>
<b>Causes of Damage to Vegetation:</b>
<br>
All ice melters that contain chlorides release ions as they form
brine solutions. Salt for instance, releases a ratio of one sodium
ion (Na+) to one chloride ion (Cl-). Calcium chloride releases
one calcium ion for every two chloride ions. Plants vary in sensitivity
to these salts. For instance, plants that grow near oceans can
tolerate high concentrations of sodium and chloride ions. Other
plants are very intolerant to these ions and can't survive when
high concentrations are present.
<P>
Damage to grass, trees, and shrubs is expensive and usually not
apparent until spring. The two common types of damage result from
direct and indirect contact.
<P>
<b>Direct Contact:</b>
<I>Application directly onto plant tissue, drainage on roots and
leaves, or contact from over spray.</I>
<Center><img src="vegetat.gif"></center>
<P>
<b>Indirect Damage:</b>
<I>The build-up of ingredients change soil conditions and prevents
plants from functioning properly.</I>
<center><img src="compact.gif"></center>
<P>
<B>Direct contact</B> from over application commonly results from
shoveling ice melter-laden snow onto a narrow strip of vegetation.
The excessive concentration of ice melters in such a small area
will kill vegetation, leaving a strip of dead grass along sidewalks
or parking lots. Changing snow removal procedures and dispersing
snow over a wide area can alleviate the problem. Direct contact
can also result from overspray or improper drainage of an ice
melter laden brine solution. Drainage problems can be corrected
by directing liquid away from vegetation or raising plant beds.
Overspray from fast moving vehicles or high winds can be reduced
with speed controls and snow fences.
<P>
<B>Indirect damage</B>, resulting from a build-up of ice melter
ingredients in the soil, is longer lasting and more difficult
to remedy. The build-up can prevent existing plants from absorbing
water and other required nutrients, while prohibiting new plant
growth. High sodium concentrations can harden soil, leaving a
layer impermeable to water. While calcium, magnesium, and potassium
ions are necessary for plant vigor, excess amounts will also result
in plant damage.
<p>
<b>Avoiding Damage to Vegetation:</b>
<br>
To avoid vegetation damage, use an ice melter made from a balance
of ingredients in conjunction with plants that are tolerant of
ice melters. Using a balanced ice melter reduces the risk of excessive
concentrations of any single ingredient. Similar logic says calcium
and magnesium chlorides pose a greater risk than potassium and
sodium chlorides because they release twice the number of damaging
chloride ions. Nurseries can recommend tolerant plant species
along with advice from a county horticultural agent, city maintenance
department, and other professionals who are familiar with salt
related vegetation damage.
<P>
The end user should always intelligently apply ice melters. Remember,
over application of any ice melter, or fertilizer for that matter,
can damage vegetation. Read labels carefully to avoid unscrupulous
manufacturers who claim their products won't harm vegetation then
instruct the user to avoid any contact with vegetation. While
any ice melter can lead to vegetation damage, the best products
will not cause harm unless misapplied or used under extreme conditions
<P>
<b>Additional precautions:</b>
<br>
<img src="blueball.gif"> Choose an ice melter with a high degree of safety to vegetation.

<title>Effects on Concrete and Other Surfaces</title>

<h1>Effects on Concrete and Other Surfaces</h1>
</center>
<B>Causes of Concrete Damage</B>
<br>
A common misconception is that all ice melters eat away at concrete
surfaces. In actuality, only three common ice melter ingredients
can chemically attack concrete: ammonium sulfate, magnesium chloride
and concentrated calcium chloride. What most end users don't realize
is that the majority of surface damage, results from a natural
process called the freeze-thaw cycle.
<P>
<I>The Freeze/Thaw Cycle</I>
<p>
<pre>
<img src="thaw1.gif" align="left">
The freeze-thaw cycle involves moisture seeping
into the cracks and surface pores which
then freeze.


<img src="thaw2.gif" align="left">
As the moisture changes to ice, it expands
which puts stress on surfaces.




<img src="thaw3.gif" align="left">
Weak pavements may not withstand the stress
resulting in cracking, scaling, or spalling.




</pre>
To better understand the freeze-thaw cycle, consider a filled
water bottle which has been sealed and placed in a freezer. As
the water inside the bottle freezes, it expands. The expansion
causes a build up of pressure which will eventually cause the
bottle to crack or explode. It should be noted that the freeze-thaw
cycle occurs naturally but is greatly accelerated by the use of
ice melters. For instance, at 25&#186;F snow and ice would not
naturally melt. But using an ice melter generates moisture which
can perpetuate the freeze-thaw cycle at temperatures colder than
32&#186;F (O&#186;C).
<P>
In addition to increasing the number of freeze-thaw cycles, the
presence of ice melter brine also increases the expansion rate
compared to water alone. Plain water expands approximately 9%
as it changes from liquid to ice. With the addition of dissolved
ice melter, the expansion rate can increase as high as 18%. The
greater the expansion rate, the greater the potential for damage.
<P>
Lastly, a lesser known cause of surface damage is the corrosion
of imbedded metal rebar. Many ice melters increase corrosion compared
to water. Corroding metal rebar will expand and eventually damage
the concrete in the process.
<P>
For more information about the effects of ice melters on corrosion
of metal, see <I>Corrosion and the Effects on Metal Surfaces.</I>
<p>
<b>Avoiding Damage</b>
<br>
The only surface made to withstand the stress of freeze-thaw cycles
is properly air-entrained concrete for cold weather climates as
recommended by the Portland Cement Association and the American
Concrete Institute. Concrete design criteria defined by these
groups are widely accepted and often referred to by municipalities
and contractors. If poured properly, the resulting concrete has
a network of tiny air pockets that allow for the expansion of
freezing moisture.
<P>
New concrete less than one year old, brick, masonry, stone, unsealed
asphalt, precast concrete, concrete with exposed aggregate are
particularly vulnerable to freeze-thaw cycles. For these surfaces,
the end user may wish to consider using a pure traction aid rather
than an ice melter. However, if the maintenance of a clear sidewalk
or driveway is critical, the end user must weigh the risk of surface
damage against the potential liability.
<P>
Recommendations for reducing the risk of surface damage:
<br>
<img src="blueball.gif"> Avoid ice melters that will chemically attack concrete.
<br>
<img src="blueball.gif"> Use an ice melter with extended refreezing protection capabilities.
<br>
<img src="blueball.gif"> Remove slush and water from melting ice and snow before refreezing
occurs.
<br>
<img src="blueball.gif"> Do not use ice melters on weak or damaged surfaces (non air-entrained).
<br>
<img src="blueball.gif"> Apply a commercial strength sealer prior to precipitation.

<title>Corrosion and the Effects on Metal Surfaces</title>
</header>
<body bgcolor="FFFFFF">
<center><img src="vigsmall.gif"><img src="coldfact.gif"><hr>
<h1>Corrosion and the Effects<br> on Metal Surfaces</h1>
</center>
Corrosion occurs when chemicals react with and break down the
structure of metal. In the case of steel, oxygen from water reacts
with iron in the steel to form ferrous oxide or rust. Almost all
ice melters act as a catalyst, increasing the reaction rate and
thus the rate of corrosion.
<pre>
                                Applications
                     Affecting Iron and Steel Structures

        <img src="bridge.gif">                <img src="heli.gif">
              Bridges                           Helipads

        <img src="parking.gif">                <img src="railroad.gif">
         Parking Structures                    Railroads
</pre>
<P>
Two deicing ingredients, calcium magnesium acetate (CMA) and pure
urea will not accelerate corrosion. In fact, there is mounting
evidence that CMA may even inhibit corrosion or reverse the effects
of prior ice melter use. These two ingredients are the only granular
compounds that are approved for use on airports where corrosion
is a principal concern. However, their use is limited by their
effective melting temperature and cost.
<P>
A standard corrosion test can be conducted by submersing a weighted
metal bar into a solution of water and dissolved ice melter. After
a period of time, the metal bar is removed, dried, and weighed.
If corrosion has occurred, the metal bar will have experienced
a loss of weight.
<P>
While this method is a generally accepted corrosion test, it is
not a realistic model for ice melter applications. Real world
conditions don't compare to a controlled lab environment and the
corrosion tests often fail to accurately model what is happening
to exposed metal or imbedded metal supports.
<P>
In an effort to reduce corrosion while maintaining economy, manufacturers
have attempted to add corrosion inhibiting agents to standard
deicing ingredients. However, these products typically blend ingredients,
which limits their ability to prevent corrosion. In blended products,
ingredients are separated when spread across a surface. Inhibitors
without any melting action will not dissolve into the brine where
corrosion occurs.
<P>
For further information on non-corrosive ingredients and inhibitors,
see <a href="ingred.html"><I>Urea, Calcium, Magnesium Acetate, and Corrosion
Inhibitors.</I></a>

<title>Ice Melter Residuals and Surface/Carpet Damage</title>
</header>
<body bgcolor="FFFFFF">
<center><img src="vigsmall.gif"><img src="coldfact.gif"><hr>
<h1>Ice Melter Residuals and<br> Surface/Carpet Damage</h1>
</center>
Depending upon the amount and type of ingredients applied, an
ice melter may leave a residue. While residues are most common
to sidewalks and parking lots, the tracking of ice melters indoors
can result in residues on all types of floors and carpets.
<P>
When sodium or potassium chlorides are applied, they dissolve
into melted snow to form a brine solution. If the concentration
is great enough and the water evaporates, a dry, white residue
may be left. Potassium and sodium residues are water soluble and
typically easy to remove. 
<P>
Calcium chloride can leave a clear, greasy residue whether tracked
in wet or dry. Besides staining, this residue can increase surface
slipperiness, attract dirt, attack finished surfaces, and may
require chemical solvents to remove.
<P>
<center>
<img src="floor.gif"><br>
<b>Floor finishes can be marred by ice melter residue.</b>
</center>
<P>
Additionally ice melter use can strip some floor finishes. Ingredients
vary in their reaction on floor finishes - with calcium chloride
being the most severe. Neutralizing agents and floor conditioners
can be used to remove residues and maintain the floor's finish.

<P>
Carpets are also vulnerable to ice melter residue. Hygroscopic
ingredients like calcium and magnesium chlorides can break down
leaving a residue that attracts dirt, causes stains, and is difficult
to remove.
<P>
<center>
<img src="chair.gif"><br>
<b>Carpet can be stained by residue from calcium chloride ice melters.</b>
</center>
<P>
Shampooing with special cleaning agents may be required. Potassium
and sodium chloride granules, when tracked onto carpets, tend
to dry out and can be easily removed by vacuuming. Because calcium
and magnesium chlorides tend to leave a greasy residue, they are
often mixed with sand for increased traction. Products comprised
of pure traction aids are also available. These, however, can
not melt ice, and can scuff polished surfaces.

<h1>Quelques conseils au sujet des semences</h1>
<img src="plantng.gif">
</center>
<br>
Pour plusieurs jardiniers, c'est la m&eacute;thode de jardinage
pr&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute;e.
<P>
Si vous vous fiez seulement aux ressources locales pour vous procurer
vos plantes en pot et &agrave; massif, vous ne profitez sans doute
pas d'une grande vari&eacute;t&eacute; de plantes... de superbes
fleurs saines et des l&eacute;gumes souvent disponibles seulement
en semence.
<P>
Plusieurs jardiniers avertis pr&eacute;f&egrave;rent les semences
pour plusieurs raisons:
<P>
<img src="greenball.gif"> Un choix plus vari&eacute; de plantes
<P>
<img src="greenball.gif"> Un co&ucirc;t bien inf&eacute;rieur, alors vous pouvez
obtenir beaucoup plus de plants sans trop d&eacute;bourser
<P>
<img src="greenball.gif"> La saison du jardinage d&eacute;bute plus t&ocirc;t 
<P>
<img src="greenball.gif"> Un meilleur sentiment de satisfaction
<P>
<img src="greenball.gif"> C'est amusant.
<P>
Les jardiniers qui utilisent des semences maintiennent que leurs
plantes sont plus saines et hardies.
<P>
Il existe plusieurs excellentes sources canadiennes pour obtenir
des semences, y compris les vendeurs par correspondance r&eacute;put&eacute;s
et bien s&ucirc;r, votre centre-jardin. Ces magasins offrent habituellement
de tr&egrave;s bons conseils au sujet de la croissance des semences.
<P>
Voici un court aper&ccedil;u pour vous aider &agrave; commencer:
<P>
<B>Les fournitures:</B>
<P>
Procurez-vous un approvisionnement de plateaux de culture et de
petits pots chez votre centre-jardin. Assurez-vous qu'ils permettent
un bon drainage. Procurez-vous aussi de la terre de rempotage
st&eacute;rilis&eacute;e, afin d'emp&ecirc;cher que les semis
soient atteints de maladies transmises du sol ou de champignons
du sol.
<P>
<B>La plantation:</B>
<P>
Selon la vari&eacute;t&eacute; de plantes, plantez les semences
4 &agrave; 8 semaines pr&eacute;c&eacute;dant le dernier gel,
si vous projetez les transplanter &agrave; l'ext&eacute;rieur.
Si vous projetez garder vos plantes &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur,
vous pouvez planter n'importe quand. 
<P>
Remplissez chaque compartiment du plateau/pot presqu'au bord avec
de la terre de rempotage st&eacute;rilis&eacute;e. Saupoudrez
quelques graines dans chaque alv&eacute;ole/pot et couvrez de
terre. Arrosez suffisamment et couvrez chaque plateau/pot d'une
pellicule en plastique transparent. Placez les contenants dans
un endroit chaud. 
<P>
D&egrave;s l'apparition des semis, retirez la pellicule en plastique
et placez-les dans un endroit ensoleill&eacute;, en s'assurant
de tourner les plateaux/pots r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement. 
<P>
Transplantez dans des pots plus gros lorsqu'ils atteindront 8
&agrave; 
<P>
10 cm de hauteur.
<P>
<B>La transplantation dans le jardin</B>
<P>
Deux semaines pr&eacute;c&eacute;dant la transplantation, placez
vos semis &agrave; l'ext&eacute;rieur pour quelques heures chaque
jour afin de les endurcir. 
<P>
Il est conseill&eacute; d'ameublir le sol une &agrave; deux semaines
avant la plantation. De cette fa&ccedil;on, les mauvaises herbes
commenceront &agrave; cro&icirc;tre et vous pourrez sarcler avant
de planter.
<P>
Quand il n'y a plus de risque de gel, transplantez-les dans le
jardin. Arrosez r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement (mais pas trop) et
fertilisez avec un engrais de bonne qualit&eacute;, tel que l'Engrais
PINK Vigoro ou l'Engrais de d&eacute;part soluble &agrave; l'eau
Instant Vigoro 10-52-10.
<P>
Les plantes vivaces cultiv&eacute;es &agrave; partir de semences
seront g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement plus large le printemps suivant
et tapisseront rapidement le jardin, pourvu que les conditions
soient favorables &agrave; leur croissance. Vous pourrez aussi
r&eacute;colter les semences de vos plantes vivaces et de vos
l&eacute;gumes (sauf pour les vari&eacute;t&eacute;s hybrides)
et les planter l'ann&eacute;e suivante. Faites s&eacute;cher les
semences lentement et placez-les dans un endroit frais et sec
durant l'hiver. R&eacute;p&eacute;tez les m&ecirc;mes &eacute;tapes
de plantation d&eacute;crites ci-dessus. 
<P>
Ce printemps, tentez votre chance avec les semences. C'est une
bonne fa&ccedil;on d'augmenter votre plaisir du jardinage... et
un bon passe-temps pour les enfants aussi!

<h1>Un intervention pr&eacute;coce est n&eacute;cessaire pour enrayer le probleme de digitaire.</h1>
<h2>(en Ontario seulement)</h2>
<img src="grass.gif">
</center>
<P>
Utilisez des moyens de d&eacute;sherbage pr&eacute;coces avant
que ces mauvaises herbes commencent &agrave; cro&icirc;tre au
printemps.
<P>
Avez-vous un PROBL&Egrave;ME avec la digitaire sur votre pelouse?
Vous pourrez le constater &agrave; l'automne, surtout si vous
apercevez des parcelles d'herbes mauves grossi&egrave;res sur
la pelouse.
<P>
La digitaire peut se propager tr&egrave;s vite autour des bordures
de la pelouse, le long des all&eacute;es d'acc&egrave;s au garage
et des sentiers. Ce PROBL&Egrave;ME cause des ennuis s&eacute;rieux
surtout en Ontario.
<P>
La digitaire poss&egrave;de l'apparence d'une herbe grossi&egrave;re
et elle envahie la pelouse faible pour enfin lui donner une apparence
clairsem&eacute;e et d&eacute;color&eacute;e. Au printemps, la
digitaire est verte p&acirc;le avec des limbes larges et courts.
<P>
Si vous apercevez une telle plante sur votre pelouse aussit&ocirc;t
que la neige dispara&icirc;t, ce n'est pas de la digitaire et
un destructeur de digitaire ne pourra pas l'enrayer.
<P>
<B>Une pelouse saine:</B>
<P>
<B>Le meilleur moyen de d&eacute;fense.</B>
<P>
Une pelouse saine et exub&eacute;rante est le meilleur moyen de
d&eacute;fense conte la digitaire, car il existe moins d'endroits
pour que les semences puissent germer et cro&icirc;tre. Des fertilisations
r&eacute;guli&egrave;res repr&eacute;sentent la meilleure fa&ccedil;on
d'obtenir une pelouse saine... en assurant la pr&eacute;sence
de tous les &eacute;l&eacute;ments nutritifs n&eacute;cessaires
pour lutter contre les mauvaises herbes et r&eacute;sister au
stress de l'hiver et des autres conditions &eacute;cologiques.
<P>
Voici le r&eacute;gime de fertilisation pour la pelouse &agrave;
&quot;quatre &eacute;tapes! que nous vous conseillons:
<P>
<B>1. Au d&eacute;but du printemps:</B> Fertiliser avec un engrais
pour la pelouse r&eacute;gulier ou un engrais avec un destructeur
de digitaire.
<P>
<B>2. Au d&eacute;but de l'&eacute;t&eacute;:</B> Fertiliser avec
un engrais r&eacute;gulier ou un engrais herbicide pour enrayer
les dicotyl&eacute;dones.
<P>
<B>3. &Agrave; la fin de l'&eacute;t&eacute;:</B> Fertiliser avec
un engrais r&eacute;gulier ou un m&eacute;lange d'engrais insecticide
pour enrayer les insectes sur la pelouse.
<P>
<B>4. Engrais d'automne:</B> Utiliser une formulation sp&eacute;ciale
con&ccedil;ue pour aider la pelouse &agrave; r&eacute;sister au
stress de l'hiver et encourager un verdissement rapide le printemps
suivant. (C'est peut-&ecirc;tre la fertilisation la plus importante,
mais souvent la plus n&eacute;glig&eacute;e.)
<P>
Assurez-vous d'utiliser un engrais &quot;&agrave; lib&eacute;ration
contr&ocirc;l&eacute;e&quot; de bonne qualit&eacute;. Ces engrais
offrent une fertilisation uniforme pendant plusieurs semaines
sans risque de br&ucirc;lure.
<P>
<B>Les strat&eacute;gies pour enrayer la digitaire</B>
<P>
La digitaire est une mauvaise herbe gramin&eacute;e <U>annuelle</U>
qui doit cro&icirc;tre &agrave; partir de semences &agrave; chaque
printemps. C'est le secret d'un r&eacute;gime efficace contre
la digitaire... &eacute;pandre l'herbicide sur le sol suffisamment
t&ocirc;t (avant le 15 mai) pour emp&ecirc;cher la germination
de ces semences.
<P>
La m&eacute;thode de proc&eacute;der la plus facile est celle
d'&eacute;pandre l'herbicide contre la digitaire avec l'engrais
du printemps, vers la p&eacute;riode de floraison de la forsythie.
Il est conseill&eacute; de tondre le gazon une fois avant d'&eacute;pandre
l'herbicide, pour faciliter la p&eacute;n&eacute;tration dans
le sol.
<P>
Vigoro fabrique un m&eacute;lange d'herbicide et d'engrais id&eacute;al
pour enrayer la germination des semences de digitaire, tout en
fertilisant la pelouse. Il fabrique aussi un herbicide granul&eacute;
sans engrais, dans l'&eacute;ventualit&eacute; que vous ayez d&eacute;j&agrave;
fait l'application d'un engrais. L'herbicide (chlorthal) enraye
seulement la digitaire et pas les autres mauvaises herbes et gramin&eacute;es.
Il est contre-indiqu&eacute; d'utiliser un herbicide contre la
digitaire sur les pelouses nouvellement ensemenc&eacute;es, les
pelouses agrostides et les jardins potagers. Le sol ne doit pas
&ecirc;tre d&eacute;rang&eacute; apr&egrave;s l'application afin
de permettre &agrave; l'herbicide de se rendre &agrave; la surface
du sol.
<P>
Veuillez lire attentivement l'&eacute;tiquette de produit et porter
des v&ecirc;tements de protection.

<h1>La pelouse &quot;&eacute;cologique&quot;.</h1>
<h2>Engrais organique ou engrais classique?</h2>
<img src="lawn.jpg">
</center>
<P>
Une pelouse bien soign&eacute;e agit comme un filtre g&eacute;ant,
en &eacute;liminant constamment les mati&egrave;res polluantes
et les gaz carboniques et en  r&eacute;approvisionnant l'alimentation
d'oxyg&egrave;ne.
<P>
Un parterre est un atout pr&eacute;cieux pour chaque maison, quelque
soit sa taille. Aujourd'hui, la plupart des propri&eacute;taires
de maison veulent maintenir une pelouse verte et saine afin de
rehausser l'apparence de la maison et d'offrir de la jouissance
&agrave; la famille. (De plus, une pelouse verte et exub&eacute;rante
fonctionne comme un meilleur filtre &agrave; air qu'une pelouse
mal soign&eacute;e). En m&ecirc;me temps, les gens sont beaucoup
plus consciencieux de l'aspect environnemental d'une pelouse soign&eacute;e.
Et plusieurs optent pour les choix naturels ou &quot;organiques&quot;.
<P>
Il existe beaucoup de confusion dans le march&eacute; des produits
de jardin et de pelouse, au sujet de la signification des termes
&quot;naturels&quot; ou &quot;organiques&quot;. De fait, quelques
produits appel&eacute;s &quot;organiques&quot; peuvent causer
plus d'ennuis &agrave; l'environnement que les produits &quot;classiques&quot;.
<P>
&Eacute;tudions un peu la fertilisation de la pelouse au point
de vue de la plante. Toutes les plantes exigent 3 &eacute;l&eacute;ments
nutritifs - l'azote (N), le phosphore (P) et la potasse (K), pour
survivre. Ces 3 &eacute;l&eacute;ments, souvent appel&eacute;s
engrais &quot;chimiques&quot; sont fabriqu&eacute;s &agrave; partir
d'&eacute;l&eacute;ments retrouv&eacute;s dans la nature. Ce sont
des min&eacute;raux raffin&eacute;s. Tous les engrais classiques
ou organiques doivent comprendre une certaine quantit&eacute;
de ces trois &eacute;l&eacute;ments nutritifs pour encourager
une croissance saine. La quantit&eacute; de chacun de ces &eacute;l&eacute;ments
est indiqu&eacute;e sur le sac d'engrais, en pourcentage. Par
exemple, l'engrais 24-4-8 contient 24% d'azote, 4% de phosphore
et 8% de potasse, en poids. Chez les produits organiques, le fumier
de vache, par exemple, contient moins que 1% d'azote, de phosphore
et de potasse (N-P-K) et peut contenir beaucoup d'herbe folle.
Ce produit est bon pour la pelouse ou le jardin, mais beaucoup
plus utile pour ajouter de la mati&egrave;re organique dans le
sol. Il est peu probable qu'il soit capable de fournir suffisamment
d'engrais pour une croissance saine des plantes. Les engrais naturels
de qualit&eacute; sup&eacute;rieure contiennent de l'azote, du
phosphore et de la potasse (N-P-K) sous forme d'ingr&eacute;dients
&agrave; l'&eacute;tat brut ou homog&egrave;nes, tels que la farine
de sang ou la farine d'os. Ils sont plus faibles en teneur d'azote,
de phosphore et de potasse que les engrais classiques, mais ils
offrent tout de m&ecirc;me un r&eacute;gime &eacute;quilibr&eacute;
pour les besoins nutritifs des plantes.
<P>
L'azote encourage un feuillage sain et vert, le phosphore encourage
un syst&egrave;me racinaire hardi et une abondance de fruits ou
de fleurs, tandis que la potasse am&eacute;liore la rusticit&eacute;
des plantes et la r&eacute;sistance aux maladies. La plante utilise
seulement la quantit&eacute; n&eacute;cessaire. L'exc&egrave;s
peut &ecirc;tre lessiv&eacute; dans l'environnement - que la source
soit classique ou organique - alors il est important de ne pas
suralimenter, ni d'offrir une sous-alimentation. 
<P>
Voici la raison pour laquelle les engrais &quot;classiques&quot;
de qualit&eacute;  peuvent parfois offrir un avantage. On croirait
qu'ils causent plus de danger avec leur teneur plus &eacute;lev&eacute;e
d'azote, de phosphore et de potasse (N-P-K). Mais quand il s'agit
d'engrais de haute qualit&eacute;, leurs &eacute;l&eacute;ments
nutritifs sont lib&eacute;r&eacute;s lentement, pour offrir seulement
la quantit&eacute; n&eacute;cessaire d'engrais durant une p&eacute;riode
de temps prolong&eacute;e. Ceci r&eacute;duit le risque de lessivage
dans les eaux souterraines et offre l'avantage de r&eacute;duire
le nombre d'applications n&eacute;cessaires durant la saison de
croissance.
<P>
La fertilisation avec la quantit&eacute; exacte d'&eacute;l&eacute;ments
nutritifs pour une croissance saine sans suralimenter est l'&eacute;l&eacute;ment-cl&eacute;
pour obtenir une pelouse saine et &eacute;cologique.  Ceci peut
se faire avec les engrais organiques &quot;naturels&quot; ou les
engrais &quot;classiques&quot;.

<h1>La question d'actualit&eacute;: </h1>
<h2>Pourquoi est-il important d'utiliser<br>
 un distributeur d'engrais?</h2>
<img src="spread2.gif">
</center>
<P>
Parfois, un client nous mentionne qu'un engrais pour pelouse n'a
pas donn&eacute; satisfaction comme il se doit. Ils ont achet&eacute;
un sac d'engrais et ils ont fait l'application sur la pelouse.
Par la suite, ils ont d&eacute;couvert un probl&egrave;me consternant.
Le probl&egrave;me &eacute;tait une croissance in&eacute;gale
de la pelouse ou des plaques &quot;br&ucirc;l&eacute;es&quot;.

<P>
L'exp&eacute;rience nous a enseign&eacute; qu'il existe g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement
un &eacute;l&eacute;ment commun lorsque ce probl&egrave;me se
manifeste. Le client n'a pas utilis&eacute; un distributeur d'engrais
convenable. Certaines personnes font une application manuelle
bien minutieuse. Ceci est &agrave; &eacute;viter lors de l'emploi
des formulations d'engrais herbicide ou insecticide, lorsque le
contact cutan&eacute; est contre-indiqu&eacute;. D'autres personnes
utilisent peut-&ecirc;tre un dispositif de fabrication maison,
tel qu'un saupoudroir m&eacute;tallique. Le r&eacute;sultat est
souvent une croissance de pelouse irr&eacute;guli&egrave;re, in&eacute;gale
et beaucoup d'endroits br&ucirc;l&eacute;s. 
<P>
Afin d'obtenir une croissance uniforme et saine de la pelouse,
il vous faut une application pr&eacute;cise d'engrais avec des
superpositions &eacute;gales, sans endroits oubli&eacute;s ou
suralimentation d'engrais. Rien n'&eacute;gale un distributeur
d'engrais de bonne qualit&eacute; pour entreprendre cette t&acirc;che.

<P>
Chaque sac d'engrais de bonne qualit&eacute; devrait comprendre
des instructions d'application d&eacute;taill&eacute;es afin d'assurer
les meilleurs r&eacute;sultats en utilisant un distributeur d'engrais.
Voici quelques points cl&eacute;s:
<P>
1. Mesurez la pelouse &agrave; traiter en m&egrave;tres, en calculant
la longueur multipli&eacute;e par la largeur du terrain (approximativement
un pas normal). Soustrayez la superficie de tous les &eacute;difices,
l'all&eacute;e d'entr&eacute;e, etc. pour obtenir la superficie
en m&egrave;tres carr&eacute;s (m&#178;) de pelouse &agrave; traiter
avec de l'engrais. (Consultez le sch&eacute;ma).
<P>
2. Achetez la quantit&eacute; n&eacute;cessaire de sacs d'engrais
pour couvrir la superficie de la pelouse (la superficie est g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement
indiqu&eacute;e sur le devant du sac en m&#178;). La plupart des
centres-jardins vous loueront aussi un distributeur d'engrais
&agrave; un prix raisonnable.
<P>
3. R&eacute;glez le distributeur d'engrais selon les directives
indiqu&eacute;es sur le dos du sac. (Prenez aussi le temps de
bien lire toutes les directives additionnelles!) Ne remplissez
pas le distributeur d'engrais sur le gazon en cas d'un renversement.
<P>
4. &Eacute;pandez l'engrais de fa&ccedil;on entrecrois&eacute;e
(consultez le sch&eacute;ma), en utilisant la moiti&eacute; de
la dose d'emploi dans chaque direction. &Eacute;vitez de manquer
des endroits ou d'&eacute;pandre &agrave; nouveau aux endroits
d&eacute;j&agrave; trait&eacute;s et fermez le distributeur d'engrais
durant les arr&ecirc;ts et en tournant les coins. En cas d'un
renversement, nettoyez &agrave; l'aide d'un balai et arrosez abondamment.
<P>
<B>Un engrais de bonne qualit&eacute; <U>favorise</U> vraiment
la pelouse.</B>
<P>
Plusieurs jardiniers particuliers trouvent la t&acirc;che de choisir
un engrais de pelouse bien difficile. Les num&eacute;ros peuvent
porter &agrave; confusion... est-ce qu'il me faut une formulation
7-7-7 ou 24-4-8? Est-ce que les &eacute;l&eacute;ments nutritifs
&agrave; lib&eacute;ration contr&ocirc;l&eacute;e justifient vraiment
le co&ucirc;t suppl&eacute;mentaire?
<P>
Il s'agit simplement de conna&icirc;tre les &eacute;l&eacute;ments
nutritifs dont votre pelouse exige. L'&eacute;l&eacute;ment nutritif
qui influence la croissance verte plus que tout autre est l'azote...
et parce que la pelouse est verte, elle exige beaucoup d'azote.
Le premier num&eacute;ro sur le sac d'engrais repr&eacute;sente
la concentration d'azote (les autres repr&eacute;sentent le phosphore
et la potasse). Une formulation 7-7-7 ne contient pas suffisamment
d'azote pour assurer une croissance saine de la pelouse pendant
une p&eacute;riode de temps prolong&eacute;e. Toutefois, si vous
augmentez la concentration d'azote r&eacute;gulier, vous risquez
de br&ucirc;ler la pelouse. Voil&agrave; la raison pour laquelle
l'azote &agrave; lib&eacute;ration contr&ocirc;l&eacute;e fut
d&eacute;velopp&eacute;. Les sources d'azote &agrave; lib&eacute;ration
contr&ocirc;l&eacute;e, telles que l'azote IBDU de Vigoro, lib&egrave;rent
l'azote de fa&ccedil;on pr&eacute;cise pendant 10 &agrave; 12
semaines, ind&eacute;pendamment de la temp&eacute;rature ou des
fluctuations d'humidit&eacute;. Une teneur plus &eacute;lev&eacute;e
d'azote &agrave; lib&eacute;ration contr&ocirc;l&eacute;e assure
une fertilisation r&eacute;guli&egrave;re pendant une plus longue
p&eacute;riode de temps et &eacute;limine pratiquement tous les
risques de br&ucirc;lure.

<h1>L'azote &agrave; lib&eacute;ration contr&ocirc;l&eacute;e</h1>
<h2>Un rem&egrave;de continuel pour la pelouse faible et &eacute;claircie.</h2>
<img src="golden.gif">
</center>
<P>
Quelle est l'apparence de votre pelouse, ce printemps?
<P>
Grasse, exub&eacute;rante et verte? ... ou peut-&ecirc;tre a-t-elle
une apparence faible et &eacute;claircie? 
<P>
Plusieurs pelouses souffrent de ces sympt&ocirc;mes, en devenant
un peu plus clairsem&eacute;es &agrave; chaque ann&eacute;e (ce
n'est malgr&eacute; pas le cas pour les mauvaises herbes), jusqu'&agrave;
ce que quelqu'un d&eacute;cide de ressemer ou d'engazonner. 
<P>
Il existe plusieurs raisons pour qu'une pelouse devienne clairsem&eacute;e
au fil du temps, y compris le ravage caus&eacute; par les insectes,
les mauvaises herbes, les mauvaises conditions p&eacute;dologiques,
le trafic, la s&eacute;cheresse et l'ombre dense. Tous ces probl&egrave;mes
peuvent nuire &agrave; la pelouse, mais en les enrayant, la pelouse
a de bonnes chances de se r&eacute;tablir, du moins dans une certaine
mesure.
<P>
Le meilleur moyen de d&eacute;fense est d'avoir une pelouse saine.
Les pelouses grasses et exub&eacute;rantes r&eacute;sistent mieux
au stress et emp&ecirc;chent les mauvaises herbes de d&eacute;rober
la pelouse de ses &eacute;l&eacute;ments nutritifs indispensables.
Par cons&eacute;quent, ces pelouses s'en tirent vainqueurs. Le
meilleur moyen d'encourager une pelouse saine est d'&eacute;tablir
un r&eacute;gime solide de fertilisation et d'arroser au besoin.
L'azote, le phosphore et la potasse sont essentiels pour une bonne
fertilisation de la pelouse. Une p&eacute;nurie d'un de ces &eacute;l&eacute;ments
nutritifs pourrait nuire s&eacute;v&egrave;rement &agrave; la
pelouse.
<P>
<B>L'azote</B> favorise une croissance verte et exub&eacute;rante,
exactement ce dont vous voulez pour votre pelouse.
<P>
<B>Le phosphore</B> encourage la rhizog&eacute;n&egrave;se et
fortifie la plante.
<P>
<B>La potasse</B> fortifie le tissu de la plante et augmente la
r&eacute;sistance aux maladies.
<P>
Mais le <U>genre</U> d'azote qui se trouve dans le sac est &eacute;galement
un facteur important. L'azote r&eacute;gulier peut se lib&eacute;rer
trop rapidement, br&ucirc;ler la plante et se lessiver dans les
eaux souterraines en quelques jours. Pour une pelouse saine, verte
et uniforme, il vous faut un <B>azote &agrave; lib&eacute;ration
contr&ocirc;l&eacute;e</B>. C'est l'&eacute;l&eacute;ment cl&eacute;
pour assurer une pelouse en parfaite condition, d'ann&eacute;e
en ann&eacute;e et l'ingr&eacute;dient cl&eacute; d'un engrais
pour pelouse de bonne qualit&eacute;.
<P>
L'azote &agrave; lib&eacute;ration contr&ocirc;l&eacute;e IBDU&#174;
de Vigoro est sans doute le meilleur sur le march&eacute;. Con&ccedil;u
pour l'usage sur les terrains de golf, l'agent IBDU&#174; lib&egrave;re
l'azote lentement et uniform&eacute;ment pendant une p&eacute;riode
de 10 &agrave; 12 semaines... quelles que soient les conditions
m&eacute;t&eacute;orologiques ou la temp&eacute;rature. Les marques
de la concurrence contiennent de l'azote &agrave; &quot;lib&eacute;ration
lente&quot; et cette lib&eacute;ration d'azote peut parfois &ecirc;tre
influenc&eacute;e par l'environnement. De plus, ces engrais fertilisent
g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement pendant seulement 6 &agrave; 8 semaines.
<P>
Les Engrais pour pelouse Golden Vigoro offrent une fertilisation
continuelle toute l'ann&eacute;e avec seulement 4 applications,
y compris les applications de produit herbicide ou insecticide,
selon le besoin. Voici un exemple:
<P>
1. Au d&eacute;but du printemps (avril-mai):
<P>
Engrais pour pelouse Golden Vigoro 24-4-8
<P>
Substituez pour l'Engrais avec destructeur de digitaire 20-4-8
si le digitaire est un probl&egrave;me.  
<P>
2. Au d&eacute;but de l'&eacute;t&eacute; (juin-juillet):
<P>
Engrais herbicide Golden Vigoro 24-4-8 pour enrayer les dicotyl&eacute;dones
tenaces, tout en fertilisant la pelouse.
<P>
Si les mauvaises herbes ne causent pas d'ennuis &agrave; la pelouse,
utilisez l'Engrais Golden Vigoro 24-4-8.
<P>
3. &Agrave; la fin de l'&eacute;t&eacute; (ao&ucirc;t-septembre):
<P>
Engrais insecticide Golden Vigoro 12-6-3 pour enrayer les scarab&eacute;es,
les punaises des c&eacute;r&eacute;ales (punaises chinchs) et
plusieurs autres insectes.
<P>
Substituez &agrave; nouveau pour l'Engrais Golden Vigoro 24-4-8
si les insectes ne ravagent pas votre pelouse.
<P>
4. &Agrave; l'automne (octobre-novembre):
<P>
Engrais d'automne Golden Vigoro 12-2-12. 
<P>
C'est une des fertilisations les plus importantes pour aider votre
pelouse contre le stress et maintenir une apparence saine, le
printemps suivant. Sa teneur en azote est plus faible &agrave;
l'automne, car la croissance verte est en p&eacute;riode de dormance
durant l'hiver... mais l'agent IBDU&#174;, ainsi que les oligo-&eacute;l&eacute;ments
demeurent dans le sol pour &ecirc;tre lib&eacute;r&eacute;s d&egrave;s
le d&eacute;but de la croissance au printemps.
<P>
Ce r&eacute;gime repr&eacute;sente un rem&egrave;de continuel
pour la pelouse faible et &eacute;claircie. Veuillez bien lire
l'&eacute;tiquette avant d'&eacute;pandre ces engrais. Manipulez
avec soin et suivez toutes les directives.

 une pelouse superbe</h1>
<h2>Un r&eacute;gime simple &quot;d'entretien pr&eacute;ventif&quot;
pour la pelouse assurera une pelouse en parfait &eacute;tat toute
l'ann&eacute;e. </h2>
<img src="forget.gif">
</center>
<P>
Vous n'avez qu'&agrave; suivre ces 10 &eacute;tapes simples pour
maintenir votre pelouse en parfait &eacute;tat:
<P>
<B>1.D&eacute;buter avec une bonne pr&eacute;paration du sol.</B>
Si vous commencez &agrave; faire cro&icirc;tre une pelouse, vous
ne regretterez jamais l'investissement que vous ferez maintenant
pour am&eacute;liorer le sol. Plusieurs pouces de profondeur de
couche arable bien &eacute;goutt&eacute;e, de sable et de mati&egrave;res
organiques assureront le meilleur milieu de croissance pour le
gazon. Pour les pelouses d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;tablies, enlevez
toutes les parcelles de neige endurcies et raclez le chaume afin
&quot;d'a&eacute;rer&quot; le gazon. Si vous le d&eacute;sirez,
vous pouvez &eacute;tendre de la tourbe-mousse, du fumier ou de
la terre v&eacute;g&eacute;tale.
<P>
<B>2. Semer, s'il est n&eacute;cessaire.</B> Tout comme avec l'engrais,les
semences de gazon de qualit&eacute; encouragent une pelouse plus
grasse. Utilisez un m&eacute;lange de bonne qualit&eacute; pour
remplir les endroits nus, ou &eacute;tendez partout &agrave; la
fin de l'automne ou au d&eacute;but du printemps, pour encourager
une nouvelle croissance. Raclez l&eacute;g&egrave;rement afin
de m&eacute;langer les graines et la terre, appliquez un engrais
de d&eacute;part et arrosez selon le besoin afin d'emp&ecirc;cher
l'ass&egrave;chement de la pelouse.
<P>
<B>3. Contr&ocirc;ler la digitaire.</B> Au d&eacute;but de printemps,
faites une application de destructeur de digitaire avec ou sans
engrais, pour contr&ocirc;ler la digitaire pendant qu'elle commence
&agrave; germer.
<P>
<B>4. Contr&ocirc;ler les dicotyl&eacute;dones.</B> Les mauvaises
herbes, telles que les pissenlits, le plantain, le mouron des
oiseaux et les autres envahissent la pelouse et &eacute;puisent
les &eacute;l&eacute;ments nutritifs du sol ... et g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement,
elles r&eacute;ussissent. Une application d'engrais herbicide
lorsque les mauvaises herbes sont en pleine croissance r&eacute;sout
le probl&egrave;me.
<P>
<B>5. Arroser ... mais seulement au besoin.</B> N'h&eacute;sitez
pas de permettre un dess&egrave;chement de la terre de surface
... ceci encouragera un gazon &agrave; racines profondes et une
tol&eacute;rance au stress.
<P>
<B>6. Contr&ocirc;ler les insectes.</B> Les scarab&eacute;es,
les punaises chinchs, les larves de tipule, les fourmis et les
larves de taupin, ainsi que tous les insectes repr&eacute;sentent
une menace s&eacute;rieuse &agrave; la pelouse et peuvent la d&eacute;truire
si les conditions sont favorables. Afin de d&eacute;terminer si
ce probl&egrave;me vous menace, coupez les deux extr&eacute;mit&eacute;s
d'une bo&icirc;te en fer-blanc de caf&eacute;, enfoncez-la jusqu'&agrave;
la moiti&eacute; dans la pelouse et remplissez-la d'eau. Si plusieurs
insectes remontent &agrave; la surface, faites une application
d'Engrais Insecticide Golden Vigoro.
<P>
<B>7. Bien ajuster les lamelles de la tondeuse.</B> Durant les
temps secs de l'&eacute;t&eacute;, il est conseill&eacute; de
laisser le gazon cro&icirc;tre un peu, ensuite de le tondre plus
long, en ajustant les lamelles de la tondeuse. &Agrave; l'automne,
tondre le gazon plus court, afin d'emp&ecirc;cher les maladies
de se propager.
<P>
<B>8. Si vous n'avez pas &agrave; contr&ocirc;ler les mauvaises
herbes ou les insectes, alors ne le faites pas.</B> Tout ce que
votre pelouse exigera alors sera une application d'Engrais pour
Pelouse Golden Vigoro 
<P>
24-4-8, &agrave; toutes les 10 &agrave; 12 semaines, pour maintenir
une pelouse saine.
<P>
<B>9. Racler les feuilles afin d'a&eacute;rer votre gazon.</B>
Les feuilles broy&eacute;es offrent un excellent paillis pour
le jardin.
<P>
<B>10. N'oubliez pas de fertiliser &agrave; l'automne.</B> C'est
une des plus importantes fertilisations. Afin de fortifier le
gazon pour survivre l'hiver, il vous faut une formulation avec
une teneur d'azote moins &eacute;lev&eacute;e que l'engrais du
printemps, mais avec une teneur plus &eacute;lev&eacute;e de potasse.
L'azote est inalt&eacute;r&eacute; sous la neige et agit rapidement
au printemps.

<h1>Plantes annuelles &agrave; massif</h1>
<h2>Des merveilles color&eacute;es et hardies.</h2>
<img src="annuals.jpg">
</center>
<P>
Si l'on compare les plantes aux courses, les plantes vivaces sont
comparables aux coureurs de fond, tandis que les plantes annuelles
sont comparables aux coureurs de vitesse. Les plantes annuelles
n'ont pas l'endurance &agrave; long terme des plantes vivaces,
mais pour la saison actuelle, leurs grosses fleurs brillantes
et durables en valent la peine.
<P>
Que vous cr&eacute;iez un jardin de fleurs annuelles ou remplissiez
des espaces d&eacute;nud&eacute;s dans le jardin de plantes vivaces,
les plantes annuelles rel&egrave;vent toujours le d&eacute;fi.
Vous n'avez qu'&agrave; vous rendre chez votre centre-jardin de
votre localit&eacute;, remplir le chariot, retourner &agrave;
la maison et planter... N'est-ce pas?
<P>
Et bien, c'est parfois aussi simple que cela, surtout si vous
ne faites que remplir des espaces vides dans un jardin d&eacute;j&agrave;
&eacute;tablie ou si vous remplissez un contenant. Mais pour obtenir
des r&eacute;sultats vraiment spectaculaires dans un jardin compos&eacute;
compl&egrave;tement de fleurs annuelles, il est pr&eacute;f&eacute;rable
d'&eacute;tablir un plan d'am&eacute;nagement de jardin.
<P>
Vous devez tout d'abord d&eacute;cider de l'effet que vous voulez
cr&eacute;er dans votre jardin... des tons frais ou chauds, des
variations d'une seule couleur ou un m&eacute;lange vif de formes
et de couleurs. Vous devez aussi choisir les plantes id&eacute;ales
pour vos conditions de croissance.
<P>
Les livres de jardinage offrent une bonne source de renseignements
pour vous aider &agrave; choisir les plantes id&eacute;ales et
les couleurs d&eacute;sir&eacute;es.
<P>
La plupart des plantes &agrave; massif sont munies d'une &eacute;tiquette
contenant les renseignements de croissance, c'est &agrave; dire
les exigences de lumi&egrave;re solaire, soit un plein soleil,
un ombrage l&eacute;ger ou dense et les conditions de sol pr&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute;es.
Peu de plantes survivent si leur nouveau milieu diff&egrave;re
beaucoup des exigences sur l'&eacute;tiquette. 
<P>
Voici quelques conseils pour obtenir une valeur maximale pour
votre argent lorsque vous ach&egrave;terez vos plantes.
<P>
<B><img src="greenball.gif"> Achetez les plantes les plus saines offertes</B> avec
une couleur      verte exub&eacute;rante, un port buissonnant
et une apparence tr&egrave;s        rameuse.
<P>
<B><img src="greenball.gif"> Choisissez des plantes qui n'ont pas d&eacute;j&agrave;
commenc&eacute; &agrave; fleurir.    </B>  Les plantes avec des
bourgeons ferm&eacute;s s'&eacute;tablissent plus           rapidement.
<P>
<B><img src="greenball.gif"> &Eacute;viter les plantes ayant souffert de stress.</B>
Les plantes &agrave; prix    aubaine provenant des vendeurs ambulants
peuvent souffrir de       pr&eacute;fanage ou de dommage au syst&egrave;me
racinaire et ceci pourra nuire    &agrave; leur croissance.
<P>
<B><img src="greenball.gif"> M&eacute;fiez-vous des sympt&ocirc;mes de ravage caus&eacute;
par les insectes et les    maladies.</B> Si vous apercevez l'un
ou l'autre, ne les achetez pas.
<P>
  Pour obtenir des plantes de premi&egrave;re qualit&eacute;,
fiez-vous aux        producteurs et aux centres-jardins r&eacute;put&eacute;s.

<P>
Lorsque vous transporterez vos plantes annuelles &agrave; la maison,
placez-les dans un endroit frais avec un ombrage l&eacute;ger
et arrosez-les souvent jusqu'au moment de la plantation pour &eacute;viter
que les racines et les tiges d&eacute;licates deviennent trop
s&egrave;ches.
<P>
Il est aussi conseill&eacute; d'ameublir le sol une &agrave; deux
semaines avant la plantation. De cette fa&ccedil;on, les mauvaises
herbes commenceront &agrave; cro&icirc;tre et vous pourrez sarcler
avant la plantation.
<P>
En plus d'&ecirc;tre un bon exercice, cela vous donnera go&ucirc;t
au jardinage plus t&ocirc;t en saison et &eacute;liminera une
bonne partie du travail lors de la journ&eacute;e de la plantation.
Impliquez aussi les enfants!
<P>
Lorsque vous serez pr&ecirc;ts &agrave; planter, espacez les semis
sur le sol et allouez suffisamment d'espace pour la croissance
&agrave; maturit&eacute;. Placez chaque plante dans son propre
trou de plantation ou creusez une tranch&eacute;e et plantez en
lignes. Placez les plantes soigneusement dans le trou, remplissez le trou de terre, entassez le sol et arrosez abondamment.
<P>
Proc&eacute;dez ensuite &agrave; un r&eacute;gime d'arrosage et
de fertilisation r&eacute;gulier avec l'Engrais pour plantes annuelles
&agrave; massif Canagro ou PINK Vigoro pour encourager des plantes
saines.

<TITLE>Les fleurs vivaces: pour un jardin &agrave; floraison continue.</title>

</header>
<body bgcolor="FFFFFF">
<center><img src="vigsmall.gif"><hr>
<h1>Les fleurs vivaces: pour un jardin &agrave; floraison continue.</h1>
<img src="perennia.gif">
</center>
<P>
Lors des ann&eacute;es 1980, soit la p&eacute;riode de la mentalit&eacute;
&quot;jetable&quot;, les fleurs annuelles &eacute;taient bien
en vogue. Vous n'aviez qu'&agrave; d&eacute;bourser de grosses
sommes d'argent au printemps, planter le fleurs dans le jardin
et voil&agrave;, vous aviez une satisfaction instantan&eacute;e.
<P>
Maintenant, les fleurs vivaces, c'est &agrave; dire les fleurs
qui croissent et fleurissent d'ann&eacute;e en ann&eacute;e, retrouvent
leur popularit&eacute; parmi les jardiniers... et pour de bonnes
raisons. (En fait, elles n'ont jamais perdu de leur cr&eacute;dit
parmi les jardiniers avertis).
<P>
Bien que les fleurs annuelles offrent une palette de couleurs
brillantes au jardin, elles demeurent tout de m&ecirc;me d'une
nature &eacute;ph&eacute;m&egrave;res. Les ann&eacute;es '90 nous
ram&egrave;nent aux valeurs de base et m&ecirc;me si les fleurs
vivaces co&ucirc;tent un peu plus cher dans les centres-jardins,
elles r&eacute;compensent le jardinier avec leur beaut&eacute;
subtile de saison en saison. De plus, elles se multiplient et
vous permettent de transplanter ses nouvelles pousses dans des
jardins additionnels ou de les &eacute;changer avec d'autres jardiniers.
<P>
Un des &eacute;l&eacute;ments indispensables pour cr&eacute;er
un jardin de fleurs vivaces de fi&egrave;re allure est votre plan
d'am&eacute;nagement de jardin. 
<P>
Avant de vous pr&eacute;cipiter au centre-jardin pour acheter
un plein chariot de plantes vivaces, nous vous conseillons de
dresser un plan d'am&eacute;nagement de jardin, en vous assurant
de bien suivre les &eacute;tapes suivantes: 
<P>
A) Identifier la vari&eacute;t&eacute; de plantes souhaitables
pour vos conditions de croissance (la quantit&eacute; d'ombre,
la condition du sol, etc...) 
<P>
B) Am&eacute;nager ces plantes de fa&ccedil;on attrayante (les
endroits naturels donnent toujours de meilleurs r&eacute;sultats)
en pla&ccedil;ant les plantes plus larges et hautes vers l'arri&egrave;re
et les plantes plus petites et basses vers l'avant.
<P>
C) Disposer les plantes selon leur couleur et leur p&eacute;riode
de floraison afin de donner un meilleur coup d'oeil pendant une
longue p&eacute;riode de temps.
<P>
Ne vous laissez pas intimider par ces &eacute;tapes - vous aurez
beaucoup de temps pour am&eacute;liorer votre plan plus tard.
Et n'h&eacute;sitez pas d'obtenir des conseils chez votre centre-jardin.
<P>
Il existe un tr&egrave;s grand nombre de fleurs vivaces de nos
jours, alors apportez votre plan d'am&eacute;nagement de jardin
chez votre centre-jardin. Il servira de guide utile pour &eacute;tablir
la quantit&eacute; n&eacute;cessaire de plantes et pour votre
gestion budg&eacute;taire. Et souvenez-vous qu'il est important
de r&eacute;sister &agrave; la tentation de planter les nouvelles
plantes trop proches l'une de l'autre... car elles exigent de
l'espace pour cro&icirc;tre et de l'air pour emp&ecirc;cher les
maladies. Alors consultez les &eacute;tiquettes de produit et
allouez l'espace n&eacute;cessaire pour obtenir le meilleur rendement.
Toute erreur commise durant cette &eacute;tape peut &ecirc;tre
corrig&eacute;e plus tard. La plupart des plantes vivaces peuvent
&ecirc;tre divis&eacute;es et transplant&eacute;es plus tard,
sans causer trop d'ennuis.
<P>
La prochaine &eacute;tape est la pr&eacute;paration du sol. Vous
devez ameublir le sol jusqu'&agrave; une profondeur minimale de
30cm... et davantage si possible. Si le sol est compact&eacute;
ou sablonneux, ajoutez un peu de terre v&eacute;g&eacute;tale,
de compost ou de fumier m&ucirc;r pour am&eacute;liorer sa texture.
<P>
Et parce que le niveau de pH du sol est important (acide ou alcalin)
pour la s&eacute;lection des plantes, il est conseill&eacute;
de proc&eacute;der &agrave; une analyse du sol. Ces &eacute;tapes
peuvent grandement influencer la taille et la qualit&eacute; de
vos plantes plus tard.
<P>
Il est pr&eacute;f&eacute;rable de planter lorsque les conditions
sont plus fra&icirc;ches et le ciel est couvert afin de r&eacute;duire
le stress et le pr&eacute;fanage caus&eacute;s par la chaleur
et la s&eacute;cheresse.
<P>
Assurez-vous que la motte de la plante demeure bien humect&eacute;e
et que les plantes soient plac&eacute;es &agrave; l'abri de la
lumi&egrave;re solaire directe jusqu'au moment de la plantation.
Creusez un trou l&eacute;g&egrave;rement plus gros que la motte
et retirez d&eacute;licatement la plante de son sachet de plastique.
Pour les plantes en pot de tourbe, vous n'avez qu'&agrave; fendre
le pot plusieurs fois afin de permettre aux racines de s'&eacute;chapper
et retirer la bordure sup&eacute;rieure. Placez la plante dans
le trou, remplissez de terre et entassez le sol autour de la tige.
Arrosez abondamment et fertilisez r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement
avec un engrais de bonne qualit&eacute;, tel que l'engrais PINK
Vigoro.

<h1>Vous avez un coin ombrag&eacute;?</h1>
<h2>Pourquoi ne pas cr&eacute;er un jardin de fleurs sauvages?</h2>
<img src="perwild.gif">
</center>
<P>
Les fleurs sauvages peuvent peut-&ecirc;tre r&eacute;pondre &agrave;
votre probl&egrave;me dans les endroits ombrag&eacute;s. Elles
r&eacute;ussissent dans des conditions plus ou moins favorables
pour la plupart des fleurs. Et vous serez m&ecirc;me &eacute;tonn&eacute;
de trouver plusieurs plantes vivaces chez votre centre-jardin
qui sont classifi&eacute;es comme fleurs sauvages cultiv&eacute;es,
presqu'identiques aux fleurs sauvages qui croissent dans les milieux
naturels. L'ancolie de Skinner, de smilax herbac&eacute;, le phlox
stolonif&egrave;re ou le phlox divariqu&eacute;, le coeur-saignant
et le sceau-de-Salomon en sont des exemples. Elles s'adaptent
bien dans des endroits ombrag&eacute;s avec les plantes de terrain
bois&eacute;, telles que l'aris&eacute;ma &agrave; trois feuilles,
la tiarelle &agrave; une feuille, l'&eacute;rythrone d'Am&eacute;rique
et plusieurs vari&eacute;t&eacute;s de foug&egrave;res.
<P>
R&eacute;sistez &agrave; la tentation de transplanter des plantes
sauvages (en plus d'&ecirc;tre ill&eacute;gal dans plusieurs endroits,
ce n'est pas &eacute;cologique).
<P>
Plusieurs p&eacute;pini&egrave;res et centres-jardins ont des
endroits r&eacute;serv&eacute;s aux fleurs sauvages et ils peuvent
vous conseiller sur les plantes qui pourront cro&icirc;tre &agrave;
l'&eacute;tat sauvage dans votre condition de sol.
<P>
Lorsque vous choisirez et pr&eacute;parerez l'endroit pour votre
jardin de fleurs sauvages, songez au milieu naturel pr&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute;
de ces plantes: c'est &agrave; dire un sol compos&eacute; de terreau
riche dans un endroit pommel&eacute; d'ombre au printemps durant
la floraison et encore plus ombrag&eacute; &agrave; la fin du
printemps et &agrave; l'&eacute;t&eacute; pour emp&ecirc;cher
la s&eacute;cheresse. Tout comme la plupart des plantes, les fleurs
sauvages ne survivront pas dans un endroit tr&egrave;s sombre
et compact.
<P>
Prenez le temps de bien pr&eacute;parer le sol avec beaucoup de
compost et de paillis et plantez de fa&ccedil;on irr&eacute;guli&egrave;re
car les fleurs sauvages offrent un meilleur coup d'oeil lorsqu'elles
sont plant&eacute;es en groupe tout comme &agrave; l'&eacute;tat
naturel.
<P>
Votre jardin aura un meilleur rendement, fleurira davantage et
r&eacute;sistera mieux &agrave; la s&eacute;cheresse avec des
fertilisations r&eacute;guli&egrave;res d'Engrais pour jardin
de fleurs sauvages et d'herboriculture de Canagro, disponible
chez votre d&eacute;positaire Vigoro. Ce m&eacute;lange organique
de haute qualit&eacute; contient tous les &eacute;l&eacute;ments
nutritifs dont les fleurs sauvages exigent pour une croissance
saine. Et n'oubliez pas d'arroser pour emp&ecirc;cher l'ass&egrave;chement
du sol. 
<P>
Avec le bon milieu de croissance, les fleurs sauvages tapisseront
votre jardin et vous donneront beaucoup de satisfaction avec leur
palette de couleurs brillantes, leurs fleurs blanches ondul&eacute;es
et leurs plantes vertes riches et fra&icirc;ches pendant des ann&eacute;es.
<P>
<B>COMMENT EMP&Ecirc;CHER LA FAUNE DE SE NOURRIR DANS VOTRE JARDIN?</B>
<P>
Il n'est pas surprenant que les animaux, les oiseaux et les insectes
soient attir&eacute;s par les jardins. Et plusieurs jardiniers
aiment bien l'augmentation de migration de la faune caus&eacute;
par un jardin. Mais comment emp&ecirc;cher ces cr&eacute;atures
de se nourrir des fleurs et du feuillage dans votre jardin?
<P>
Plusieurs plantes vivaces sont r&eacute;fractaires &agrave; l'&eacute;gard
des insectes et des animaux. &Agrave; cause de leur go&ucirc;t
ou leur propri&eacute;t&eacute; toxique, la faune les &eacute;vite.
Voici quelques exemples:
<P>
<B>R&Eacute;FRACTAIRE &Agrave; L'&Eacute;GARD DES CHEVREUILS ET
D'AUTRES ANIMAUX:</B>
<P>
L'astilbe, le coeurs-saignant, l'ancolie, le narcisse, le raisin
d'Am&eacute;rique, l'iris, la pervenche, la lavande, le mertensia
panicul&eacute; et le tournesol.
<P>
<B>R&Eacute;FRACTAIRE &Agrave; L'&Eacute;GARD DES INSECTES:</B>
<P>
Le tag&egrave;te 
<P>
<B>D'AUTRES MOYENS DE R&Eacute;PRESSION:</B>
<P>
Il existe plusieurs r&eacute;pulsifs &quot;naturels&quot; sur
le march&eacute; qui valent la peine d'&ecirc;tre essay&eacute;s.
(Quelques jardiniers saupoudrent de la farine de sang pour tenir
les chevreuils &agrave; l'&eacute;cart. Malgr&eacute; que nous
ne pouvons pas garantir son efficacit&eacute; en tant que r&eacute;pulsif,
nous vous assurerons que c'est un engrais formidable pour am&eacute;liorer
le sol). 
<P>
Essayez un savon insecticide pour enrayer les insectes. En r&egrave;gle
g&eacute;n&eacute;rale, utilisez des moyens plus organiques pour
commencer, ensuite des insecticides puissants selon le besoin.

<TITLE>Les bassins de plantes aquatiques:</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor="FFFFFF">
<center><img src="vigsmall.gif"><hr>
<h1>Les bassins de plantes aquatiques:</h1>
<h2>pour offrir un effet paysager &agrave; votre arri&egrave;re-cour.</h2>
<img src="waterlil.jpg">
</center>
<P>
Imaginez un peu l'effet suivant: des plantes aquatiques et exub&eacute;rantes,
des rochers, des lis des &eacute;tangs, des cascatelles, un &eacute;clair
de couleur orange sous l'eau, peut-&ecirc;tre est-ce un poisson,
et pour musique de fond, le ruissellement et le gargouillement
de l'eau contre les rochers. 
<P>
Maintenant, imaginez-vous parmi cette sc&egrave;ne dans votre
arri&egrave;re-cour. C'est plus simple que vous le croyez.
<P>
Les bassins de plantes aquatiques deviennent de plus en plus populaires
chez les jardiniers canadiens, et il est facile de comprendre
la raison. Ces bassins sont superbes, reposants et apportent beaucoup
de satisfaction au jardinier. &Agrave; cause de leur popularit&eacute;,
il existe aujourd'hui beaucoup plus d'endroits qui vendent des
plantes aquatiques, des fournitures pour bassins et offrent m&ecirc;me
le service d'installation.
<P>
Quand il s'agit d'&eacute;tablir un plan d'am&eacute;nagement
d'un bassin de plantes aquatiques et de l'installer, il existe
d'innombrables options, telles que l'installation fait par un
paysagiste ou de cr&eacute;er un projet &agrave; faire soim&ecirc;me.
Votre centre-jardin pourra vous aider. Plusieurs d'entre-eux ont
d&eacute;j&agrave; am&eacute;nag&eacute; des bassins de plantes
aquatiques dans leur salle d'exposition, comprenant des plans
d'am&eacute;nagement, des toiles pour bassins, des pompes, des
plantes et davantage en main. N'h&eacute;sitez pas de demander
des renseignements.
<P>
Tout comme les autres types de jardins, il est important d'&eacute;tablir
un plan d'am&eacute;nagement. Pr&eacute;occupez-vous surtout de
la fa&ccedil;on dont le bassin s'agencera avec l'ensemble de votre
parterre. Vous voulez surtout pouvoir jouir de votre bassin de
plantes aquatiques et de ses diff&eacute;rents aspects en disposant
des si&egrave;ges &agrave; proximit&eacute;. Vous pouvez profiter
pleinement d'une pente naturelle en y am&eacute;nageant une multitude
de niveaux et de chutes.
<P>
Faites l'exp&eacute;rience en fabriquant un croquis du bassin
de taille r&eacute;elle &agrave; l'aide d'une corde ou d'un boyau
d'arrosage. Si vous planifiez ajouter des poissons, vous allez
devoir am&eacute;nager un bassin d'une profondeur minimale de
1 m&egrave;tre dans les climats froids pour permettre un espace
suffisant pour la formation de la glace, sinon vous allez devoir
d&eacute;m&eacute;nager les poissons &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur
durant l'hiver. Si vous avez des ennuis avec les ratons laveurs
dans votre voisinage, il serait pr&eacute;f&eacute;rable d'&eacute;viter
les poissons.
<P>
Aussit&ocirc;t que vous d&eacute;terminerez la taille du bassin,
rendez-vous chez votre centre-jardin pour v&eacute;rifier la disponibilit&eacute;
des tailles de toile de bassin. Vous pourrez choisir entre une
toile plate qui &eacute;pousera la forme du trou creus&eacute;
ou un bassin pr&eacute;-moul&eacute;. Il vous faudra aussi des
pompes et filtres pour maintenir la circulation, l'a&eacute;ration
et la propret&eacute; de l'eau, un facteur important pour favoriser
la croissance saine des plantes et la vie aquatique.
<P>
Une fois que vous aurez choisi votre toile, vous pourrez commencer
&agrave; creuser. Une installation pr&eacute;cise &eacute;vitera
des ennuis plus tard, alors prenez votre temps. Une fois que votre
bassin est am&eacute;nag&eacute; et en &eacute;tat de fonctionnement,
vous &ecirc;tes pr&ecirc;t pour les plantes.
<P>
Il existe une grande vari&eacute;t&eacute; de plantes aquatiques
de toutes formes et tailles, &agrave; partir des lis qui croissent
enti&egrave;rement dans l'eau, aux plantes des marais qui croissent
au bord de l'eau. Commencez avec quelques plantes et ajoutez-en
&agrave; fur et &agrave; mesure que votre jardin s'&eacute;tablisse.
Plusieurs plantes peuvent &ecirc;tre laiss&eacute;es dans leur
contenant, ce qui facilite leur d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement &agrave;
l'int&eacute;rieur en cas de besoin. N'ajoutez pas de poissons
ou d'autre vie aquatique suivant la plantation jusqu'&agrave;
ce que l'eau devienne s&eacute;dentaire.
<P>
Il est &eacute;galement important de nourrir les plantes et les
poissons dans votre bassin, cependant vous n'avez pas &agrave;
le faire aussi souvent. Vigoro vous offre un tout nouvel engrais
pour bassin de plantes aquatiques qui est id&eacute;al. Simplement
plonger la quantit&eacute; n&eacute;cessaire de briquettes dans
les contenants de plantes aquatiques et le tour est jou&eacute;
pour la saison enti&egrave;re. Elles lib&egrave;rent des &eacute;l&eacute;ments
nutritifs lentement, sans causer d'ennuis &agrave; la vie aquatique,
aux filtres ou &agrave; l'&eacute;quipement. Exigez les Briquettes
pour bassin de plantes aquatiques Vigoro.

<TITLE>L'analyse du sol de votre jardin</title>
</HEAD>
</header>
<body bgcolor="FFFFFF">

<h1>L'analyse du sol de votre jardin</h1>
<img src="soilsetl.gif">
</center>
<p>
Connaissez-vous bien la concentration en &eacute;l&eacute;ments
nutritifs du sol de votre jardin? C'est une question importante
pour la sant&eacute; des plantes d'ext&eacute;rieur et d'int&eacute;rieur.
Un sol riche en &eacute;l&eacute;ments nutritifs offre beaucoup
plus qu'un milieu favorable pour l'enracinement. Un sol bien structur&eacute;
favorise la respiration des racines, offre le bon &eacute;quilibre
d'&eacute;l&eacute;ments nutritifs et d'eau &agrave; la plante
et poss&egrave;de la bonne mesure de pH pour toutes les vari&eacute;t&eacute;s
de plante de votre jardin.
<P>
Un sol pauvre en &eacute;l&eacute;ments nutritifs emp&ecirc;che
la croissance de la plante de plusieurs fa&ccedil;ons. S'il est
trop riche en argile, il devient trop tenace et compact, nuit
au drainage, emp&ecirc;che l'air de se rendre aux racines et s'agglom&egrave;re.
Par contre, si le sol est trop sablonneux, il perd son eau, s'&eacute;rode
facilement et ne retient pas les &eacute;l&eacute;ments nutritifs
n&eacute;cessaires pour l'assimilation par la plante. Il vous
faut donc un sol &eacute;quilibr&eacute; pour &eacute;viter ces
deux extr&ecirc;mes. Dans votre main, le sol doit avoir une consistance
humide et meuble, sans glisser entre vos doigts. De plus, il doit
poss&eacute;der une odeur propre et fra&icirc;che et une couleur
riche et fonc&eacute;e.
<P>
Pour conna&icirc;tre la structure de votre sol, m&eacute;langez
une poign&eacute;e de terre dans un verre transparent contenant
de l'eau et attendez plusieurs heures jusqu'&agrave; ce que l'eau
redevienne limpide. Les particules grossi&egrave;res de sable
se d&eacute;poseront au fond du verre avec des couches de limon
par dessus. Les particules plus fines d'argile se d&eacute;poseront
enfin par dessus  et l'humus (mati&egrave;re organique) flottera
sans doute &agrave; la surface de l'eau claire. Vous pourrez alors
d&eacute;terminer la composition de votre sol avec une vue de
c&ocirc;t&eacute;.
<P>
S'il est compos&eacute; principalement de sable, vous pourrez
am&eacute;liorer votre sol consid&eacute;rablement en y ajoutant
de la terre v&eacute;g&eacute;tale organique et de la mousse de
tourbe. S'il est compos&eacute; principalement de limon et d'argile,
l'addition de sable lav&eacute; am&eacute;liorera consid&eacute;rablement
le drainage et l'a&eacute;ration.
<P>
Tous les types de sol b&eacute;n&eacute;ficieront d'une application
g&eacute;n&eacute;reuse de compost. Bien incorporer la mati&egrave;re
dans le sol jusqu'&agrave; une profondeur de 15cm &agrave; 20cm
avant la plantation.
<P>
<B>LES NIVEAUX DE pH DU SOL</B>
<P>
L'acidit&eacute; ou l'alcalinit&eacute; du sol est mesur&eacute;e
par les valeurs du pH sur une &eacute;chelle de 1 (tr&egrave;s
acide) &agrave; 14 (tr&egrave;s alcalin). Une &eacute;chelle de
7 est consid&eacute;r&eacute;e &quot;neutre&quot;. Chaque niveau
est dix fois sup&eacute;rieure ou inf&eacute;rieure au prochain,
par ex: 5 est dix fois plus acide que 6 et 100 x plus acide que
7. Un niveau de pH de 8 est dix fois plus alcalin que 7 et ainsi
de suite.
<P>
Le niveau de pH du sol influence la disponibilit&eacute; d'&eacute;l&eacute;ments
nutritifs pour les plantes et la vari&eacute;t&eacute; de plantes
que vous cultivez. Par exemple, les azal&eacute;es et les rhododendrons
exigent beaucoup de fer, un oligo-&eacute;l&eacute;ment qui devient
r&eacute;duit quand le niveau d'alcalinit&eacute; du sol augmente.
Ces plantes pr&eacute;f&egrave;rent un sol plus acide, riche en
fer... autrement leurs feuilles deviennent jaunes entre les veines.
D'autres oligo-&eacute;l&eacute;ments en p&eacute;nurie peuvent
&eacute;galement causer une multitude d'effets n&eacute;fastes.
<P>
La plupart des plantes croissent mieux si le niveau de pH est
d'une valeur de 6.5 &agrave; 7.2, car les &eacute;l&eacute;ments
nutritifs sont facilement assimilables et c'est le niveau de pH
pr&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute; des plantes. Mais vous devez conna&icirc;tre
tout d'abord le niveau actuel de pH du sol.
<P>
Vous pouvez vous procurer une trousse d'analyse du sol &agrave;
un prix tr&egrave;s raisonnable chez votre centre-jardin ou informez
vous aupr&egrave;s d'eux pour une liste des ressources locales
qui effectuent des analyses d'&eacute;chantillon de sol. 
<P>
Le sol alcalin peut &ecirc;tre neutralis&eacute; en y ajoutant
de la mousse de tourbe ou une petite quantit&eacute; de Sulfate
d'aluminium de Vigoro. Le sol acide peut &ecirc;tre neutralis&eacute;
en y ajoutant  du Calcaire dolomitique de Vigoro. Lisez bien l'&eacute;tiquette
et changez le niveau de pH du sol lentement et soigneusement pour
ne pas trop influencer l'&eacute;quilibre dans l'autre direction.
Le compost neutralise aussi le pH du sol et y ajoute des &eacute;l&eacute;ments
nutritifs en m&ecirc;me temps.
<P>
<B>LES &Eacute;L&Eacute;MENTS NUTRITIFS DU SOL</B>
<P>
Toutes les plantes exigent un bon &eacute;quilibre d'engrais ternaire:
l'azote, le phosphore et la potasse, ainsi que des oligo-&eacute;l&eacute;ments
en quantit&eacute; minuscule, tels que le magn&eacute;sium, le
cuivre, le fer, le calcium,la mangan&egrave;se et plusieurs autres.
Faites une analyse du sol pour conna&icirc;tre le niveau de ces
&eacute;l&eacute;ments nutritifs et pour y ajouter ceux qui sont
en p&eacute;nurie, sous forme d'engrais. Ils seront assimil&eacute;s
par la plante sans tarder (pourvu que le niveau de pH du sol est
suffisamment neutre) et encourageront une croissance saine. Quel
que soit le niveau de pH du sol, l'absence d'un &eacute;l&eacute;ment
nutritif cl&eacute; peut nuire &agrave; la croissance. En utilisant
un engrais tout usage de bonne qualit&eacute;, tel que l'Engrais
PINK Vigoro, vous encouragez une fertilisation ad&eacute;quate
n&eacute;cessaire &agrave; la plante.

<TITLE>Le jardin d'ombre:</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor="FFFFFF">
<center><img src="vigsmall.gif"><hr>
<h1>Le jardin d'ombre: </h1>
<h2>Un secret bien gard&eacute;.</h2>
<img src="shadeg.gif">
</center>
<P>
L'ombre repr&eacute;sente un obstacle pour le jardinier... mais
si vous abordez le sujet comme une opportunit&eacute; au lieu
d'une &eacute;preuve, vous pourrez cr&eacute;er de superbes effets
paysagers. Les jardins d'ombre sont particuli&egrave;rement invitants
durant les mois chauds de l'&eacute;t&eacute;, car ils offrent
un refuge du soleil. Tandis que les jardins d'ombre sont connus
pour leur palette de couleurs vertes riches, ils offrent aussi
bien d'autres options de couleurs.
<P>
Pour cr&eacute;er un jardin d'ombre &agrave; succ&egrave;s, vous
devez tout d'abord d&eacute;terminer le genre d'ombre &agrave;
l'emplacement choisi. C'est une &eacute;tape importante pour la
s&eacute;lection et la croissance de vos plantes. Les plantes
d'ombre sont g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement plus riches en chlorophylle
que les plantes adapt&eacute;es au soleil. Elles sont plus sensibles
&agrave; la lumi&egrave;re et trop de lumi&egrave;re solaire pourrait
les br&ucirc;ler ou jaunir leur feuillage.
<P>
Il existe quatre cat&eacute;gories d'ombre utilis&eacute;es comme
norme dans l'industrie de l'am&eacute;nagement paysager. Elle
sont: 
<P>
1. <U>L'ombre pommel&eacute;e</U>, la cat&eacute;gorie la plus
claire. C'est l'ombre l&eacute;g&egrave;re caus&eacute;e par le
mouvement des arbres.
<P>
2. <U>L'ombre l&eacute;g&egrave;re</U> se trouve sur le versant
nord des &eacute;difices, des cl&ocirc;tures, etc., o&ugrave;
la lumi&egrave;re solaire directe est obstru&eacute;e mais le
rayonnement indirect rebondit dans les endroits ombrag&eacute;s.

<P>
3. <U>L'ombre moyenne</U> se trouve aussi sur le versant nord,
par contre la lumi&egrave;re solaire est obstru&eacute;e davantage
par les arbres, le feuillage et les branches. Les pelouses situ&eacute;es
dans ces endroits seront plus clairsem&eacute;es que les pelouses
situ&eacute;es dans des endroits plus ensoleill&eacute;s.
<P>
4. <U>L'ombre dense</U> repr&eacute;sente le plus gros d&eacute;fi
pour la croissance et limite la s&eacute;lection des plantes.
Elle se trouve soit au versant nord des endroits abrit&eacute;s
par des murs &eacute;lev&eacute;s, soit sur les c&ocirc;t&eacute;s
ou sous le couvert d'arbres.
<P>
Notez les diff&eacute;rentes cat&eacute;gories d'ombre autour
de votre maison avant la plantation du jardin. Vous pourrez peut-&ecirc;tre
augmenter l'intensit&eacute; de lumi&egrave;re solaire &agrave;
certains endroits en taillant le feuillage ou en peinturant un
mur ou une cl&ocirc;ture d'une teinte plus p&acirc;le afin de
permettre une meilleure r&eacute;flectance lumineuse aux endroits
ombrag&eacute;s.
<P>
Une fois que vous aurez d&eacute;termin&eacute; les cat&eacute;gories
d'ombre autour de votre maison, votre centre-jardin pourra vous
aider &agrave; choisir les plantes id&eacute;ales pour chaque
endroit. Il existe plusieurs choix pour toutes les cat&eacute;gories
d'ombre, sauf l'ombre dense. En voici quelques unes:
<P>
 
<P>
<B>Vari&eacute;t&eacute; de plante</B>
<P>

<B>Endroits pr&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute;s</B>
<P>
Ombre pommel&eacute;e, sol humide et acide.
<P>
Ajoutez une quantit&eacute; g&eacute;n&eacute;reuse de tourbe

<B>Endroits pr&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute;s</B>
<P>
Ombre pommel&eacute;e &agrave; l&eacute;g&egrave;re au printemps
et ombre dense &agrave; l'&eacute;t&eacute;.
<P>
Utilisez seulement les vari&eacute;t&eacute;s cultiv&eacute;es
dans les centres-jardins et non celles cueillies dans les champs.
<P>
Il existe plusieurs autres vari&eacute;t&eacute;s de plantes d'ombre...
et le r&eacute;sultat final se promet d'&ecirc;tre spectaculaire.

<P>
La plupart des plantes d'ombre b&eacute;n&eacute;ficieront d'une
application de compost. Assurez-vous aussi de bien fertiliser
r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement avec n'importe quel engrais tout usage
de bonne qualit&eacute;, tel que l'Engrais PINK Vigoro, l'Engrais
nature pour plantes vivaces ou l'Engrais pour jardin de fleurs
sauvages de Canagro.

<TITLE>L'&eacute;lagage: taillez votre jardin pour am&eacute;liorer son aspect ornemental</title>

<h1>L'&eacute;lagage: taillez votre jardin pour am&eacute;liorer son aspect ornemental</h1>
<img src="shears.gif">
</center>
<P>
&Ecirc;tes-vous parmi ceux qui n'aiment pas l'&eacute;lagage,
qu'il s'agisse d'une plante d'int&eacute;rieur, d'un rosier ou
d'un arbre? Ne vous inqui&eacute;tez pas.
<P>
La plupart des plantes appr&eacute;cient un &eacute;lagage de
temps &agrave; autre. En plus de survivre &agrave; l'op&eacute;ration,
elles en b&eacute;n&eacute;ficieront aussi.
<P>
L'&eacute;lagage sert &agrave; enlever les parties mortes, les
branches infest&eacute;es par les insectes ou les maladies, ainsi
que les branches entrecrois&eacute;es ou ayant une apparence faible.
L'&eacute;lagage am&eacute;liore l'aspect ornemental de la plante,
la circulation d'air, l'acc&egrave;s de lumi&egrave;re et recr&eacute;e
un bon &eacute;quilibre entre la croissance des racines et de
la partie &eacute;pig&eacute;e. (Une ou l'autre peut &ecirc;tre
&eacute;lagu&eacute;e).
<P>
<B>Voici quelques conseils pour l'&eacute;lagage:</B>
<P>
1. Choisissez les plantes avec soin, en prenant en consid&eacute;ration
leur taille naturelle arriv&eacute;e &agrave; maturit&eacute;.
Il est contre-indiqu&eacute; d'&eacute;laguer un arbre ou un arbuste
&agrave; une taille bien inf&eacute;rieure &agrave; sa taille
naturelle.
<P>
2. L'&eacute;branchage des jeunes arbres devrait se faire graduellement
au cours de plusieurs ann&eacute;es de croissance.
<P>
3. &Eacute;laguez plus l&eacute;g&egrave;rement les sempervirents
ayant des feuilles en forme d'aiguilles, car elles ne repoussent
pas aussi bien que les feuilles des arbres feuillus.
<P>
4. &Eacute;vitez si possible d'&eacute;laguer durant les p&eacute;riodes
de croissance active. Les plantes qui fleurissent au printemps
devraient &ecirc;tre &eacute;lagu&eacute;es imm&eacute;diatement
suivant la floraison.
<P>
5. Utilisez des instruments bien aiguis&eacute;s pour assurer
une coupe rase. Il est conseill&eacute; de faire tremper les outils
de jardinage dans de l'alcool entre les op&eacute;rations d'&eacute;lagage
pour &eacute;viter la propagation des maladies d'une plante &agrave;
une autre.
<P>
6. Faites une coupe losange directement au dessus du bourgeon,
en vous assurant  que la partie inf&eacute;rieure de la coupe
soit &agrave; un angle oppos&eacute; au bourgeon et fait face
au centre de l'arbre. (Voir l'illustration.)
<P>
7. Afin de permettre plus de lumi&egrave;re sur le feuillage,
vous pouvez &eacute;laguer quelques branches sur toute la longueur
de la tige principale... surtout les branches qui croissent directement
vers le haut, ainsi que celles qui sont endommag&eacute;es ou
entrecrois&eacute;es.
<P>
8. Les plantes en conteneur b&eacute;n&eacute;ficieront d'une
taille des racines et une transplantation. Taillez 2.5cm (ou davantage
pour les plantes de grande taille) sur la surface enti&egrave;re
de la motte &agrave; l'aide d'un couteau bien aiguis&eacute;.
<P>
9. Il est g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement pr&eacute;f&eacute;rable
d'&eacute;laguer au printemps. Consultez votre centre-jardin si
vous &ecirc;tes incertains de la p&eacute;riode propice pour une
vari&eacute;t&eacute; de plante particuli&egrave;re.
<P>
<B>La bo&icirc;te &agrave; outils de l'&eacute;lagueur:</B>
<P>
Tout comme il en est le cas avec la plupart des t&acirc;ches,
les outils appropri&eacute;s, bien soign&eacute;s et aiguis&eacute;s
peuvent faciliter grandement la t&acirc;che d'&eacute;lagage.
Voici une s&eacute;lection d'outils dont vous voudrez peut-&ecirc;tre
vous procurer si vous ne les avez pas d&eacute;j&agrave;:
<P>
<I>Des s&eacute;cateurs</I> sont des outils de jardinage essentiels.
Ils ressemblent &agrave; des pinces ou des petits ciseaux robustes.
Ils sont id&eacute;aux pour tailler les branches ou les tiges
de la dimension d'un doigt. Sa conception &agrave; deux lames
frottantes, arqu&eacute;es en bec de perroquet pour enserrer les
branches &agrave; couper, repr&eacute;sente sa caract&eacute;ristique
la plus utile.
<P>
<I>Un &eacute;brancheur (s&eacute;cateur &agrave; haie)</I> ressemble
&agrave; de tr&egrave;s forts s&eacute;cateurs &agrave; longues
manches. Un outil id&eacute;al pour couper les branches de 2cm
&agrave; 4cm (&#190;&quot; &agrave; 1&#189;&quot;) d'&eacute;paisseur.
Recherchez les styles &agrave; manches robustes pour offrir une
bonne multiplication de force et des lames incurv&eacute;es.
<P>
<I>Une scie &agrave; &eacute;laguer</I> est utile pour les branches
plus grosses. Le mod&egrave;le pliant est id&eacute;al pour les
plus petites t&acirc;ches. Une scie &agrave; deux tranchants avec
des dents robustes &agrave; une extr&eacute;mit&eacute; de la
lame pour les grands travaux et des dents plus fines &agrave;
l'autre extr&eacute;mit&eacute; repr&eacute;sente une autre option.
<P>
Pour les grands arbres, <I>une scie &agrave; &eacute;laguer de
longue port&eacute;e</I> permet de couper les branches sup&eacute;rieures
d'un arbre sans l'aide d'une &eacute;chelle.

<TITLE>La culture de fleurs, d'herbes et de l&eacute;gumes en conteneur: une alternative pour les petits espaces.</title>

<h1>La culture de fleurs, d'herbes et<br> de l&eacute;gumes en conteneur:
une<br> alternative pour les petits espaces.</h1>
<h2>Une alternative formidable pour<br> ceux qui manquent d'espace</h2>
<img src="hanging.jpg">
</center>
<P>
Si vous avez le pouce vert mais vous manquez d'espace, la culture
en conteneur peut r&eacute;pondre &agrave; vos besoins.
<P>
Vous pouvez cultiver presque toutes les vari&eacute;t&eacute;s
de plantes dans des conteneurs, soit &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur
ou &agrave; l'ext&eacute;rieur. Les l&eacute;gumes, les plantes
&agrave; fleur, les herbes, les arbustes ou les plantes d'int&eacute;rieur
peuvent &ecirc;tre cultiv&eacute;s s&eacute;par&eacute;ment ou
ensemble pour cr&eacute;er un aspect visuel unique.
<P>
Les m&ecirc;mes r&egrave;gles fondamentales s'appliquent &agrave;
tous les types de jardinage:
<P>
<img src="greenball.gif"> D&eacute;butez avec de la terre de rempotage de bonne qualit&eacute;.
<P>
<img src="greenball.gif"> Allouez un drainage ad&eacute;quat et surtout &eacute;vitez
un arrosage excessif.
<P>
<img src="greenball.gif"> Choisissez des plantes qui conviennent &agrave; l'intensit&eacute;
de lumi&egrave;re disponible.
<P>
<img src="greenball.gif"> Fertilisez r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement.
<P>
Vigoro fabrique un excellent engrais &agrave; lib&eacute;ration
contr&ocirc;l&eacute;e, l'Engrais pour jardini&egrave;re et corbeille
suspendue 14-12-14. Vous n'avez qu'&agrave; saupoudrer la quantit&eacute;
requise sur le sol pour une fertilisation qui durera de 10 &agrave;
12 semaines.
<P>
<B>Un jardin d'herboriculture pour aiguiser l'app&eacute;tit.</B>
<P>
Les herbes fra&icirc;ches offrent une nuance d&eacute;licieuse
aux salades et aux aliments que vous pr&eacute;parez. De plus,
ce sont des ajouts int&eacute;ressants dans le jardin. Elles taquinent
les sens: la vue, le go&ucirc;ter, l'odorat, et le toucher de
fa&ccedil;on non surpass&eacute;e. Rien n'&eacute;gale la fragrance
fra&icirc;che qui vous accueille quand vous vous trouvez &agrave;
proximit&eacute; d'une s&eacute;lection d'herbes.
<P>
L'herboriculture n'est pas difficile car ces plantes s'adaptent
presque n'importe o&ugrave;, pourvu que l'endroit soit bien ensoleill&eacute;.
La plupart des herbes exigent un minimum de 6 heures de soleil
par jour.
<P>
Vous pouvez am&eacute;nager un jardin uniquement d'herbes ou vous
pouvez incorporer les herbes avec d'autres plantes dans un jardin
potager, vivace ou de roses. Ou bien, plantez-les dans des petits
contenants dans la cuisine o&ugrave; vous pourrez tailler la quantit&eacute;
voulue. La taille fr&eacute;quente favorise les herbes. (De fait,
elles pr&eacute;f&egrave;rent &ecirc;tre taill&eacute;es fr&eacute;quemment).
<P>
Le sol d'un jardin d'herboriculture doit &ecirc;tre bien pr&eacute;par&eacute;,
drain&eacute; et l&eacute;g&egrave;rement acide pour assurer les
meilleurs r&eacute;sultats. Incorporez l'Engrais de fleurs sauvages
et d'herboriculture Vigoro lors de la plantation, ensuite &eacute;pandez
une quantit&eacute; additionnelle en surface.
<P>
Vous pouvez jouir d'un jardin d'herboriculture en toute saison.

<P>
Plusieurs jardiniers font s&eacute;cher les herbes et les entreposent
pour la consommation future. C'est si facile que &ccedil;a en
vaut la peine, surtout quand vous go&ucirc;terez aux r&eacute;sultats.
Il est pr&eacute;f&eacute;rable de r&eacute;colter les herbes
durant les temps frais et ennuag&eacute;s. Faites une coupe rase
et plongez les herbes dans l'eau froide pour emp&ecirc;cher le
pr&eacute;fanage.
<P>
Le secret pour pr&eacute;server le go&ucirc;t d&eacute;licieux
et la fragrance se trouve dans la m&eacute;thode de s&eacute;chage.
Que vous les suspendiez en botte ou que vous les &eacute;tendiez
sur un s&eacute;choir pour fines herbes, il est important que
les feuilles ne soient pas tass&eacute;es afin de permettre une
bonne circulation d'air. L'endroit de s&eacute;chage id&eacute;al
est un milieu ti&egrave;de (pas chaud), sombre et bien ventil&eacute;
pour &eacute;viter le risque de moisissure.
<P>
Quand les herbes sont s&eacute;ch&eacute;es, mais avant qu'elles
ne deviennent cassantes, placez-les dans des contenants en verre
ou en argile, &eacute;tiquetez-les pour &eacute;viter la confusion
et datez-les. Elles dureront de 6 mois &agrave; 3 ans ou plus,
selon la vari&eacute;t&eacute; de plante.

<TITLE>Comment attirer les pr&eacute;dateurs utiles dans le jardin</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor="FFFFFF">
<center><img src="vigsmall.gif"><hr>
<h1>Comment attirer les pr&eacute;dateurs<br> utiles dans le jardin</h1>
<h2>Il suffit de Dame Nature, des pr&eacute;dateurs utiles<br>
 et quelques recettes d'autrefois et le tour est jou&eacute;!</h2>
<img src="gard3.gif">
</center>
<P>
Le jardin offre une s&eacute;duction immense &agrave; plusieurs
insectes de tous les genres. Les racines d&eacute;licates, les
tiges et le feuillage de votre jardin ne sont pas disponibles
aux insectes dans un milieu naturel, tel que les champs. &Agrave; bien y songer, c'est la
raison pour laquelle les insectes sont attir&eacute;s vers votre
jardin. Il repr&eacute;sente un repas succulent. Vous pouvez par
contre leur emp&ecirc;cher l'acc&egrave;s.
<P>
Bien s&ucirc;r, il existe plusieurs produits chimiques sur le
march&eacute;. La plupart d'entre eux furent d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s
durant les derniers 50 ans dans l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t d'une meilleure
production agricole. Mais plusieurs jardiniers pr&eacute;f&egrave;rent
ne pas utiliser ces produits, sauf en dernier recours, et parfois
pas du tout.
<P>
De fait, la plupart des agriculteurs utilisent moins de produits
chimiques aujourd'hui qu'il y a 10 ans. Ils retournent m&ecirc;me
aux m&eacute;thodes de r&eacute;pression plus organiques et une
technique nomm&eacute;e &quot;la lutte int&eacute;gr&eacute;e
contre les ennemis des cultures&quot;.
<P>
C'est un nom technique pour signifier une m&eacute;thode utilis&eacute;e
par les agriculteurs pendant plus d'un si&egrave;cle. Cela signifie
tout simplement que les agriculteurs profitent des &quot;pr&eacute;dateurs&quot;
utiles pour enrayer les &quot;pr&eacute;dateurs&quot; nuisibles...
&eacute;vitant ainsi l'emploi des produits antiparasitaires qui
peuvent &ecirc;tre nocifs envers les pr&eacute;dateurs utiles.
<P>
Plusieurs cr&eacute;atures, telles que les oiseaux, les chauves-souries,
les serpents, les araign&eacute;es, les crapauds, les insectes
utiles et d'autres esp&egrave;ces de la faune peuvent tous jouer
un r&ocirc;le important dans la lutte int&eacute;gr&eacute;e contre
les ennemis des cultures sur la pelouse et dans le jardin.
<P>
Alors, la meilleure fa&ccedil;on de d&eacute;buter votre r&eacute;gime
de lutte int&eacute;gr&eacute;e contre les ennemis des cultures
est d'encourager la pr&eacute;sence des pr&eacute;dateurs utiles
(du moins, autant que vous pouvez tol&eacute;rer) dans votre jardin.
Voici comment s'y prendre:
<P>
Les oiseaux se nourrissent d'une grande quantit&eacute; d'insectes
et de vers dans votre jardin. M&ecirc;me durant l'hiver, ils r&eacute;duisent
la quantit&eacute; de larve hivernante et d'oeufs d'hiver qui
se trouvent sur l'&eacute;corce des arbres et des arbustes. Installez
plusieurs maisons d'oiseaux afin d'attirer plusieurs esp&egrave;ces.
N'oubliez surtout pas de nourrir les oiseaux durant l'hiver. Vous
pouvez aussi ajouter des arbres et des arbustes pr&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute;s
au paysage pour am&eacute;liorer l'habitat des oiseaux.
<P>
Les insectes utiles, tels que les araign&eacute;es, les coccinelles
et les abeilles sont tr&egrave;s b&eacute;n&eacute;fiques pour
le jardin. &Eacute;vitez d'utiliser des insecticides chimiques
pour enrayer les insectes nuisibles en pr&eacute;sence d'une population
imposante d'insectes utiles dans votre jardin.
<P>
Les m&eacute;thodes manuelles, telles que les pi&egrave;ges, les
dispositifs protecteurs et la cueillette manuelle repr&eacute;sentent
tous de bons moyens pour r&eacute;duire le nombre d'insectes nuisibles.
Un tube en carton enfouie sous la terre autour de la tige &eacute;loignera
les vers gris. Les escargots, les limaces et les chenilles peuvent
&ecirc;tre enlev&eacute;s &agrave; la main et plac&eacute;s dans
une bo&icirc;te m&eacute;tallique remplie d'eau savonneuse. La
terre de diatom&eacute;es disponible chez votre centre-jardin
est une autre m&eacute;thode &eacute;cologique pour enrayer les
insectes nuisibles. Saupoudrez sur le sol autour des plantes et
ses particules abrasives couperont le corps tendre des limaces
ou des insectes, pour enfin les d&eacute;truire ou du moins les
chasser de votre jardin. Des pi&egrave;ges collants de papier
adh&eacute;sif jaune sont efficaces pour attraper les mouches
blanches (aleurodes).
<P>
Des pulv&eacute;risations chimiques seront peut-&ecirc;tre n&eacute;cessaires
si l'une ou toutes les m&eacute;thodes mentionn&eacute;es ci-dessus
&eacute;chouent. Quelques uns de ces produits sont moins nocifs
envers l'utilisateur et l'environnement que d'autres. Consultez
votre centre-jardin pour des conseils &agrave; cet effet. (Apportez
un &eacute;chantillon de la plante infect&eacute;e.) N'oubliez
surtout pas de bien lire l'&eacute;tiquette avant d'utiliser des
produits antiparasitaires. Les plantes r&eacute;sistantes offrent
une autre solution pour r&eacute;duire le dommage dans votre jardin.
Et n'oubliez surtout pas qu'une plante saine r&eacute;siste beaucoup
mieux aux insectes et aux maladies. Il existe des choix organiques:
les Engrais natures &quot;All Natural&quot; de Canagro vous donnerons
pleine satisfaction.

<TITLE>Guide &agrave; l'intention des plantes de couverture</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor="FFFFFF">
<center><img src="vigsmall.gif"><hr>
<h1>Guide &agrave; l'intention des <br>plantes de couverture</h1>
<h2>Un bon substitut pour la pelouse et une solution id&eacute;ale
pour les endroits o&ugrave; la croissance est difficile.</h2>
<img src="gard1.gif">
</center>
<P>
Parfois, malgr&eacute; tous nos efforts, nous ne pouvons pas faire
cro&icirc;tre du gazon &agrave; certains endroits. Peut-&ecirc;tre
est-il le temps d'essayer les plantes de couverture.
<P>
Une fois &eacute;tablie, ces plantes &agrave; v&eacute;g&eacute;tation
basse vivace, telles que la pervenche, le lierre, l'Orpin &acirc;cre,
le thym, la Pachysandre et le coton&eacute;astre peuvent offrir
d'excellents substituts &agrave; la pelouse, ainsi qu'une allure
exub&eacute;rante et naturelle et &eacute;ventuellement, elles
exigent tr&egrave;s peu d'entretien. Elles sont id&eacute;ales
pour les endroits ombrag&eacute;s, autour des arbres et sur les
collines, o&ugrave; il est difficile de maintenir une belle pelouse
par contre, elles ne tol&egrave;rent pas bien le trafic dense.
<P>
Les plantes de couverture sont souvent plus co&ucirc;teuses que
la pelouse, alors assurez-vous de choisir la vari&eacute;t&eacute;
la mieux adapt&eacute;e &agrave; votre emplacement et de cr&eacute;er
un environnement sain pour leurs exigences de croissance.
<P>
Votre centre-jardin pourra vous conseiller &agrave; ce sujet.
G&eacute;n&eacute;ralement, les plantes de couverture offrent
une meilleure apparence si elles sont plant&eacute;es en grande
quantit&eacute; et de fa&ccedil;on irr&eacute;guli&egrave;re.
Certaines vari&eacute;t&eacute;s peuvent &ecirc;tre plant&eacute;es
&agrave; proximit&eacute; l'une de l'autre, tandis que d'autres
ne peuvent pas.
<P>
Dans plusieurs cas, la pelouse et les plantes de couverture se
complimentent bien... surtout lorsque les endroits de plantation
sont bien choisis pour chacune, c'est &agrave; dire la forme g&eacute;n&eacute;rale
du jardin, les diff&eacute;rentes conditions de sol, la quantit&eacute;
de lumi&egrave;re solaire, etc... Un bon plan d'am&eacute;nagement
r&eacute;dig&eacute; sur papier facilitera &eacute;norm&eacute;ment
la t&acirc;che... &eacute;vitera les probl&egrave;mes et aidera
aussi votre budget.
<P>
Si vous plantez des plantes de couverture dans des endroits o&ugrave;
il y a du trafic, songez &agrave; installer un sentier de pav&eacute;
autobloquant, des dalles ou autres. Le sentier pourrait avoir
une allure informelle, longeant les contours naturels du paysage
ou une allure sym&eacute;trique, avec une conception en ligne
droite et des bordures pour complimenter le jardin g&eacute;om&eacute;trique.
Si vous ne savez pas quel style vous convient mieux, informez-vous
aupr&egrave;s de votre centre-jardin &agrave; savoir s'il offre
les services d'un sp&eacute;cialiste en embellissement paysager.
Ces sp&eacute;cialistes se rendent &agrave; votre domicile pour
vous donner des conseils. 
<P>
M&ecirc;me si les plantes de couverture exigent &eacute;ventuellement
tr&egrave;s peu d'entretien une fois qu'elles sonnant &eacute;tablies,
vous devrez tout de m&ecirc;me passer les 2 &agrave; 3 premi&egrave;res
ann&eacute;es &agrave; aider les plantes &agrave; survivre, sans
succomber &agrave; un &eacute;touffement par les mauvaises herbes
et ce, jusqu'&agrave; ce qu'elles puissent tapisser compl&egrave;tement
le jardin. Vous allez devoir sarcler manuellement, car g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement
les herbicides commerciaux endommagent autant les plantes de couverture
que les mauvaises herbes. Vous pouvez aussi emp&ecirc;cher les
mauvaises herbes d'envahir votre jardin pendant les premi&egrave;res
2 &agrave; 3 ann&eacute;es avec des applications de paillis autour
des nouvelles plantes de couverture et ceci permettra aussi la
croissance de racines et des rameaux.
<P>
Fertilisez ces nouvelles plantes avec un engrais riche en phosphore,
tel que l'Engrais de d&eacute;part Vigoro jusqu'&agrave; ce que
vous obteniez un enracinement solide, ensuite utilisez une formulation
riche en azote pour encourager la croissance verte (l'Engrais
pour pelouse 24-4-8 Golden Vigoro, l'Engrais Evergreen Instant
Vigoro 30-10-10 ou l'Engrais pour c&egrave;dres et arbustes sont
tous id&eacute;aux).
<P>
Cette ann&eacute;e, tentez votre chance avec les plantes de couverture.
Dans quelques ann&eacute;es, vous jouirez d'un jardin exub&eacute;rant
et vert, parsem&eacute; de fleurs bleues (pervenche), blanches
(Pachysandre, coton&eacute;astre, muguet), roses (phlox stolonif&egrave;re,
Orpin &acirc;cre), ainsi que bien d'autres fleurs color&eacute;es
au printemps. Durant l'&eacute;t&eacute;, le jardin sera couvert
de taches de couleurs fra&icirc;ches et de tons verts variants.
Quelques unes, comme le coton&eacute;astre produisent des baies
rouges ou blanches plus tard en saison... tandis que d'autres
vari&eacute;t&eacute;s sont persistantes, pour une belle allure
toute l'ann&eacute;e. 
<P>
Quelle que soit la vari&eacute;t&eacute; choisie... les r&eacute;sultats
valent la peine d'attendre. Vos efforts suppl&eacute;mentaires
durant les premi&egrave;res ann&eacute;es vous r&eacute;compenseront
avec un paysage de longue dur&eacute;e, exigeant tr&egrave;s peu
d'entretien. Vous serez peut-&ecirc;tre m&ecirc;me l'orgueil du
voisinage!

<h1>L'horticulture biologique:</h1>
<h2>une id&eacute;e pas d'aujord'hui,<br>
mais qui a tout de m&ecirc;me du m&eacute;rite ...</h2> 
<img src="gard2.gif">
</center>
<p>
Le jardinier d'aujourd'hui poss&egrave;de un vaste choix de mat&eacute;riaux
et de produits pour l'aider &agrave; embellir ce dont la nature
lui offre.
<P>
Plusieurs mat&eacute;riaux nouveaux disponibles aux jardiniers
d'aujourd'hui sont le r&eacute;sultat de progr&egrave;s dans le
domaine de l'agriculture. Depuis les derniers 100 ans, les cultivateurs
font face &agrave; un besoin de devoir nourrir un nombre croissant
de gens pendant que l'expansion urbaine r&eacute;duit la quantit&eacute;
de terre agricole. 
<P>
Ils ont pu relever le d&eacute;fi, en obtenant des meilleurs rendements
avec moins de terre ... soit en utilisant la technologie &agrave;
son maximum. Les tracteurs ont remplac&eacute; les chevaux, alors
que la machinerie et les produits chimiques ont remplac&eacute;
beaucoup de travaux &agrave; se casser les reins. Plusieurs de
ces d&eacute;couvertes furent adopt&eacute;es par les jardiniers
particuliers.
<P>
<B>Un aper&ccedil;u de l'art de cultiver avant la technologie
du 20i&egrave;me si&egrave;cle</B>
<P>
En 1881, une commission agricole de l'Ontario a &eacute;tudi&eacute;
certaines m&eacute;thodes agricoles utilis&eacute;es pour am&eacute;liorer
le rendement des cultures. M&ecirc;me &agrave; cette &eacute;poque,
les cultivateurs savaient qu'ils devaient am&eacute;liorer le
rendement des cultures. Et ils savaient aussi qu'ils devaient
remettre de quoi dans le sol afin de ne pas l'&eacute;puiser et
de ne pas diminuer le rendement et la qualit&eacute; des cultures.
<P>
Plusieurs cultivateurs ont &eacute;tudi&eacute; diff&eacute;rentes
m&eacute;thodes plus efficaces d'utiliser le fumier. Et les cultivateurs
plus innovateurs ont proc&eacute;d&eacute; &agrave; des exp&eacute;riences
avec les ressources naturelles, telles que le gypse, la poussi&egrave;re
d'os et les phosphates, ayant tous d'excellents pouvoirs pour
am&eacute;liorer le rendement.
<P>
Les pr&eacute;occupations, telles que les r&eacute;sidus chimiques
dans les produits alimentaires et la d&eacute;gradation seraient
des probl&egrave;mes de l'avenir. 
<P>
<B>Il y a eu beaucoup de changement en un peu plus de 100 ans,
mais plusieurs m&eacute;thodes demeurent toujours inchang&eacute;es.</B>
<P>
Maintenant, plusieurs cultivateurs et jardiniers retournent aux
habitudes de nos ant&eacute;c&eacute;dents afin d'&eacute;tudier
&agrave; nouveau quelques unes de ces anciennes pratiques. Quelques
uns sont pr&ecirc;ts &agrave; r&eacute;duire le rendement afin
d'obtenir une culture de meilleure qualit&eacute; pour la sant&eacute;
du consommateur, pour le bien-&ecirc;tre du sol et pour l'environnement.
<P>
<B>L'horticulture biologique: tout en observant ce dont on a appris</B>
<P>
L'agriculture moderne nous offre d'&eacute;normes progr&egrave;s
scientifiques pr&eacute;cieux, m&ecirc;me dans le domaine de l'horticulture
biologique. Par exemple, nous pouvons pr&eacute;voir avec pr&eacute;cision
les besoins nutritifs de diverses plantes afin d'encourager une
croissance saine. Les &eacute;l&eacute;ments nutritifs cl&eacute;s
sont <I><B>l'azote</B></I>, pour encourager une croissance verte,
<I><B>le phosphore</B></I>, pour encourager un syst&egrave;me
racinaire hardi et un bon rendement de fleurs, de fruits et de
l&eacute;gumes et <I><B>la potasse</B></I>, pour fortifier la
plante et encourager la r&eacute;sistance et la rusticit&eacute;.
Les oligo-&eacute;l&eacute;ments (tels que le fer, le magn&eacute;sium,
le zinc et le cuivre) occupent aussi un r&ocirc;le important pour
favoriser une croissance &eacute;quilibr&eacute;e; une p&eacute;nurie
d'un de ces oligo-&eacute;l&eacute;ments pourrait nuire s&eacute;rieusement
&agrave; la croissance de la plante.
<P>
Une analyse du sol d&eacute;montre la quantit&eacute; d'&eacute;l&eacute;ments
nutritifs pr&eacute;sente dans le sol. Ensuite, il suffit seulement
d'ajouter les &eacute;l&eacute;ments nutritifs en p&eacute;nurie
afin de maintenir une croissance saine et &eacute;quilibr&eacute;e.
Souvent, les engrais organiques ou biologiques r&eacute;pondent
&agrave; ces besoins d'&eacute;l&eacute;ments nutritifs.
<P>
<B>Le choix des engrais organiques/biologiques d'aujourd'hui</B>
<P>
Lorsque la plupart des jardiniers entendent le terme engrais organique
ou engrais biologique, ils songent au fumier. Tandis que le fumier
est une excellente m&eacute;thode pour am&eacute;liorer la texture
du sol et sa teneur en mati&egrave;res organiques, sa teneur en
&eacute;l&eacute;ments nutritifs essentiels est toutefois souvent
insuffisante pour les exigences de la plante.
<P>
Le compost est une excellente fa&ccedil;on d'am&eacute;liorer
la teneur en mati&egrave;res organiques du sol et offre des &eacute;l&eacute;ments
nutritifs importants. Utiliser autant de compost que possible.
<P>
<I>Les engrais organiques ou biologiques</I> de haute qualit&eacute;
sont disponibles chez plusieurs centres-jardins. La ligne de produits
Canagro est un exemple. Ces produits sont compos&eacute;s d'ingr&eacute;dients
naturels, tels que la farine d'os, le gypse, la farine de varech
et la farine de sang, tous &eacute;prouv&eacute;s pour encourager
la croissance de la plante.
<P>
Mais n'oubliez surtout pas les <I>&quot;engrais classiques&quot;</I>
lorsque vous recherchez des mati&egrave;res organiques pour vos
plantes. Quelques uns, tels que les engrais Golden Vigoro, sont
formul&eacute;s avec une base organique et contiennent un niveau
d'azote plus &eacute;lev&eacute; pour les exigences particuli&egrave;res
de la pelouse. &Eacute;viter les engrais qui contiennent des agents
de remplissage, tels que la pierre ou la boue d'&eacute;puration.

<TITLE>Les jardins de rocaille</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor="FFFFFF">
<center><img src="vigsmall.gif"><hr>
<h1>Les jardins de rocaille</h1>
<h2>Prenez avantage des exemples<br> que vous offre Dame Nature.</h2>
<img src="rockg.gif">
</center>
<P>
Un jardin de rocaille peut cr&eacute;er un ancrage splendide pour
votre plan d'am&eacute;nagement paysager ou accentuer l'aspect
visuel d'un bassin de plantes aquatiques. Les plus jolis jardins
de rocaille sont ceux qui offrent une allure naturelle. Si le
temps vous le permet, remarquez comment les roches sont plac&eacute;es
autour d'un cours d'eau ou d'un terrain rocheux:
<P>
<img src="greenball.gif"> Les grosses roches sont plac&eacute;es au niveau inf&eacute;rieure.
<P>
<img src="greenball.gif"> Il existe plusieurs grosseurs de roches ayant la m&ecirc;me
texture et couleur.
<P>
<img src="greenball.gif"> Les roches qui reposent sur le sol sont g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement
plac&eacute;es avec le c&ocirc;t&eacute; plus stable vers le bas
et une bonne portion enterr&eacute;e dans le sol.
<P>
<img src="greenball.gif"> Les roches sont plac&eacute;es en groupe au hasard, petites
et grosses ensemble, tandis que d'autres sont solitaires. Elles
ne sont pas espac&eacute;es &eacute;galement.
<P>
<img src="greenball.gif"> Les plantes sont plac&eacute;es en grappe parmi les roches de
fa&ccedil;on informelle.
<P>
Tentez d'am&eacute;nager votre jardin en suivant ces exemples
ou consultez votre centre-jardin pour de l'aide. (Plusieurs d'entre-eux
vendent et installent les roches.) Sur les pentes fortes, vous
devriez peut-&ecirc;tre songer &agrave; un am&eacute;nagement
en terrasses successives, en cr&eacute;ant deux banquettes ou
plus avec des murs de sout&egrave;nement en pierres pour emp&ecirc;cher
l'&eacute;rosion et permettre l'emploi de quelques plantes sarmenteuses
ou peut-&ecirc;tre une chute d'eau &agrave; niveaux multiples.

<P>
D&eacute;placez les roches dans le jardin jusqu'&agrave; ce que
l'allure vous plaise et qu'elles offrent l'apparence d'avoir &eacute;t&eacute;
&agrave; cet endroit depuis un temps. Enfoncez-les un peu dans
le sol. Vous pouvez aussi placer des roches plates sur le sol
pour servir de marches d'escalier ou de palier pour le jardinage.
Et bien s&ucirc;r, laissez un peu d'espace ici et l&agrave; pour
les plantes.
<P>
Assurez-vous d'avoir un sol en bonne condition pour la plantation
avant m&ecirc;me de d&eacute;m&eacute;nager les roches pour ne
pas avoir &agrave; ajouter de la terre par la suite. Votre sol
devrait &ecirc;tre compos&eacute; d'une bonne profondeur de terre
limoneuse bien drain&eacute;e. Si vous &ecirc;tes incertains de
la texture du sol, ajoutez de la terre v&eacute;g&eacute;tale
organique, du compost, de la mousse de tourbe ou du fumier m&ucirc;r.
Vous ne voulez pas devoir ajouter de la terre apr&egrave;s la
plantation du jardin.
<P>
Utilisez les exemples de Dame Nature encore une fois pour l'am&eacute;nagement
des plantes. Am&eacute;nagez ensemble des grappes de plantes vari&eacute;es.
Am&eacute;nagez des plantes contrastantes qui s'agencent bien
ensemble. C'est une bonne id&eacute;e d'&eacute;tablir un plan
d'am&eacute;nagement sur papier, en notant la hauteur des plantes
lorsqu'elles atteindront leur maturit&eacute;, leur emplacement
dans le jardin et la disponibilit&eacute; de lumi&egrave;re solaire.
Apportez ce plan avec vous au centre-jardin... vous pourrez alors
choisir vos plantes avec plus de confiance et obtenir des conseils
pratiques du personnel de vente s'il est n&eacute;cessaire et
&eacute;conomiser de l'argent en &eacute;vitant d'acheter les
plantes qui ne conviennent pas.
<P>
Songez aussi &agrave; planter des gramin&eacute;es ornementales
ou des plantes de couverture parsem&eacute;es de fleurs vivaces,
annuelles ou sauvages. Les v&eacute;g&eacute;tations basses, telles
que la mousse et les plantes de couvertures offrent une belle
allure parmi les roches et croissent bien dans les petites crevasses.
&Eacute;vitez les plantes sarmenteuses et les plantes rampantes,
car elles peuvent enti&egrave;rement cacher les roches, &agrave;
moins que vous vous pr&eacute;pariez &agrave; un sarclage r&eacute;gulier.
<P>
Une fois &eacute;tablie, la plupart des jardins de rocaille exigent
tr&egrave;s peu d'entretien... vous n'avez qu'&agrave; repiquer
quelques plantes de temps &agrave; autre si elles deviennent trop
grosses ou planter des fleurs annuelles pour remplir quelques
endroits jusqu'&agrave; ce que les fleurs vivaces croissent &agrave;
maturit&eacute;.
<P>
Un r&eacute;gime r&eacute;gulier de fertilisation avec un engrais
de haute qualit&eacute; &agrave; base organique, tel que l'Engrais
PINK Vigoro vous aidera &agrave; maintenir un jardin de rocaille
en parfaite condition, d'ann&eacute;e en ann&eacute;e.

<TITLE>Le jardin potager</title>

<h1>Le jardin potager</h1>
<h2>Un bon plan d&egrave;s le d&eacute;part assurera une production
de l&eacute;gumes succulents et moins de perte.</h2>
<img src="veg.gif">
</center>
<P>
Les fruits et les l&eacute;gumes frais ont toujours meilleur go&ucirc;t...
et pour de bonnes raisons. Le ma&iuml;s, les haricots, les pois,
les tomates et les autres l&eacute;gumes ont meilleur go&ucirc;t
quand ils sont cueillis directement du jardin. Les l&eacute;gumes
de l'&eacute;picerie sont souvent cueillis bien &agrave; l'avance
et parfois avant qu'ils soient m&ucirc;rs, pour leur permettre
de m&ucirc;rir en cours de route. En ayant votre propre jardin
potager, vous pourrez cueillir vos l&eacute;gumes quand ils seront
juste &agrave; point! Quel d&eacute;lice!
<P>
Afin d'obtenir le meilleur jardin potager possible, vous devez
d&eacute;buter avec deux &eacute;tapes primordiales: un sol de
bonne qualit&eacute; et un bon plan d'am&eacute;nagement. 
<P>
Votre sol peut &ecirc;tre am&eacute;lior&eacute; avec un bon drainage
et la pr&eacute;sence d'une grande quantit&eacute; de mati&egrave;re
organique. Le compost repr&eacute;sente un des meilleurs moyens
pour am&eacute;liorer le sol. Si vous n'avez pas d&eacute;j&agrave;
commencer le compostage, ne tardez pas &agrave; le faire. C'est
une fa&ccedil;on formidable de se d&eacute;barrasser des ordures
(sauf la viande et les produits laitiers) et une m&eacute;thode
id&eacute;ale de &quot;recycler&quot; les feuilles, les tontes
de gazon et les d&eacute;bris v&eacute;g&eacute;taux. Si vous
ne poss&eacute;dez pas une composti&egrave;re, vous pouvez ajouter
de la mousse de tourbe ou du fumier m&ucirc;r dans le jardin.
<P>
Prenez le temps de bien mesurer l'emplacement de votre jardin
potager et dressez un plan d'am&eacute;nagement de jardin sur
papier. De cette fa&ccedil;on, vous serez en meilleure mesure
de choisir les semences appropri&eacute;es lors de votre visite
au centre-jardin, et vous vous &eacute;viterez des maux de t&ecirc;te.
<P>
<B>Voici quelques conseils lors du dressage de votre plan d'am&eacute;nagement
de jardin:</B>
<P>
1. Songez bien aux choix et &agrave; la quantit&eacute; de plantes
par rapport &agrave; leur p&eacute;riode de r&eacute;colte. Une
douzaine de pommes de laitue ne vous semble peut-&ecirc;tre pas
exag&eacute;r&eacute;e, mais si elles sont toutes pr&ecirc;tes
pour la r&eacute;colte le m&ecirc;me jour, vous en aurez trop.
Si vous voulez une grande quantit&eacute;, songez plut&ocirc;t
&agrave; des vari&eacute;t&eacute;s qui poss&egrave;dent des p&eacute;riodes
de maturit&eacute; variantes. Vous pouvez aussi semer la m&ecirc;me
vari&eacute;t&eacute; &agrave; des intervalles de 1 &agrave; 2
semaines. Assurez-vous simplement que les plantes atteignent leur
maturit&eacute; avant le gel.
<P>
2. Semez les l&eacute;gumes que votre famille aime manger. (Vos
enfants pourraient peut-&ecirc;tre faire le sarclage du jardin,
et par cons&eacute;quent, apprendre &agrave; aimer les pois et
le navet...!)
<P>
3. Allouez suffisamment d'espace pour permettre la p&eacute;n&eacute;tration
de lumi&egrave;re pour une croissance &agrave; maturit&eacute;.
Apr&egrave;s le risque des gel&eacute;s du printemps, vous pourrez
semer ou repiquer vos l&eacute;gumes dans votre jardin. Par contre,
si vous pr&eacute;f&eacute;rez, vous pouvez toujours commencer
vos semis &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur dans des petits conteneurs
et les transplanter dans le jardin au moment propice.
<P>
Aussit&ocirc;t que le temps se r&eacute;chauffe (&agrave; la fin
du printemps), il est pr&eacute;f&eacute;rable d'ajouter du paillis
autour des plantes pour conserver l'humidit&eacute; et enrayer
la croissance des mauvaises herbes. Vous pouvez utiliser de la
paille, du bran de scie, des feuilles, de l'&eacute;corce ou du
fumier. Si vous pr&eacute;f&eacute;rez une autre option, vous
pouvez &eacute;tendre un film plastique ou papier sur le sol et
percer des petits trous pour les plants de l&eacute;gumes.
<P>
Un jardin potager &eacute;tabli exige des sarclages, des arrosages
et des fertilisations r&eacute;guliers. Utilisez un engrais de
bonne qualit&eacute;, tel que l'Engrais PINK Vigoro, l'Engrais
pour l&eacute;gumes soluble &agrave; l'eau Instant Vigoro ou l'Engrais
granul&eacute; pour l&eacute;gumes Vigoro.
<P>
Observez continuellement le jardin pour le risque d'infestation
des ennemis des cultures. Toutes sortes de b&ecirc;tes seront
tent&eacute;es par votre jardin, &agrave; partir des lapins jusqu'aux
insectes. Les cl&ocirc;tures emp&ecirc;cheront l'acc&egrave;s
aux b&ecirc;tes plus grosses, tandis qu'il existe plusieurs options
pour enrayer les insectes. Dans la mesure du possible, ma&icirc;trisez
les insectes en les enlevant &agrave; la main ou en utilisant
un savon insecticide doux. &Eacute;vitez l'usage des insecticides
plus puissants sur les cultures vivri&egrave;res. Si par contre,
vous choisissez de les utiliser, veuillez suivre avec soin les
informations sur l'&eacute;tiquette.
<P>
Bonne chance avec votre jardin potager, cette ann&eacute;e. Et
bon app&eacute;tit!

<center><img src="vigsmall.gif"><hr>
<h1>Un projet de pomme de terre pour les &quot;bouts de choux&quot;.</h1>
</center>
<p>
Voici un projet de jardinage int&eacute;rieur id&eacute;al pour
les enfants:
<P>
Trouvez une pomme de terre avec un d&eacute;veloppement de germes.
(Si vous laissez une pomme de terre dans un endroit chaud, obscure
et humide, vous accomplirez ceci). Coupez la pomme de terre en
morceaux, chacun ayant un &quot;germe&quot;.
<P>
Rassemblez un sac de terre de rempotage, un bocal d'engrais Instant
Vigoro 20-20-20, et quelques petits pots. (Pour ces derniers,
des verres &agrave; boire en plastique sont id&eacute;als.)
<P>
Votre enfant pourra alors remplir les pots jusqu'au 2/3 de terre
de rempotage et planter le germe &agrave; une profondeur d'environ
2.5cm, avec le germe face au dessus. M&eacute;langez l'engrais
Instant Vigoro selon le mode d'emploi, et arrosez la terre de
rempotage abondamment. 
<P>
Placez les plantes &agrave; proximit&eacute; d'une fen&ecirc;tre
faisant face au nord ou sous une &quot;lampe horticole&quot;,
et attendez que les semis bourgeonnent. Lorsque les plantes auront
atteint quelques centim&egrave;tres de hauteur, transplantez-les
dans des pots d&eacute;coratifs plus gros. 
<P>
Lorsque les plantes auront atteint leur maturit&eacute;, vous
trouverez quelques petites pommes de terre d&eacute;licieuses
sous la terre ... et vos petits jardiniers seront tr&egrave;s
fiers d'eux-m&ecirc;mes.
<P>
Voici les ingr&eacute;dients n&eacute;cessaires pour ce projet
de &quot;pommes de terre&quot;. 
<P>
<B>LUMI&Egrave;RE:</B> 
<P>
De 4 &agrave; 6 heures de lumi&egrave;re intense &agrave; tous
les jours, mais       pas la lumi&egrave;re solaire directe, assureront
de bons r&eacute;sultats.
<P>
<B>ENGRAIS</B>: 
<P>
La fertilisation avec un engrais soluble &agrave; l'eau de bonne
qualit&eacute;, tel que l'engrais Instant Vigoro fournira un r&eacute;gime
&eacute;quilibr&eacute; aux plantes, avec tr&egrave;s peu de risque
de &quot;br&ucirc;lure&quot;. Fertiliser &agrave; toutes les 2
semaines durant la p&eacute;riode de croissance.
<P>
<B>EAU</B>:
<P>
La terre ne devrait jamais devenir compl&egrave;tement s&egrave;che,
ni constamment satur&eacute;e d'eau. Quand la terre est presque
s&egrave;che, mais avant le point de fl&eacute;trissure, arroser
jusqu'&agrave; ce que la terre devienne compl&egrave;tement satur&eacute;e
d'eau.

<h1>Durant l'hiver, vous pouvez<br> jardiner &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur</h1>
</center>
<P>
Quelques conseils au sujet des plantes d'int&eacute;rieur et un
projet de pomme de terre pour les &quot;bouts de choux&quot;.
<P>
Vous avez d&eacute;j&agrave; pr&eacute;par&eacute; votre jardin
pour l'hiver; c'est &agrave; dire taill&eacute; les branches d'arbres
et les plantes vivaces, enlev&eacute; les feuilles mortes, plant&eacute;
des bulbes, recouvert le jardin de paillis, enlev&eacute; &agrave;
nouveau d'autres feuilles mortes, fertilis&eacute; la pelouse
&agrave; l'aide d'un engrais d'automne et rang&eacute; vos outils
de jardinage.
<P>
Si vous avez toujours le go&ucirc;t de jardiner apr&egrave;s tous
ces travaux, (soyez sans crainte, il existe des milliers de canadiens
qui partagent votre amour du jardinage) il existe plusieurs autres
projets de jardinage que vous pourrez entreprendre &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur.
<P>
Par contre, tout comme certains jardiniers, il existe plusieurs
plantes qui exigent une p&eacute;riode de repos durant l'hiver
avant qu'elles puissent cro&icirc;tre de nouveau. Ces plantes
perdent souvent leurs feuilles &agrave; l'automne. Afin d'encourager
le repos, arr&ecirc;tez de les fertiliser afin de permettre un
ass&egrave;chement du sol, ensuite arrosez l&eacute;g&egrave;rement
pour emp&ecirc;cher un dess&egrave;chement complet du sol. S'il
est toutefois possible, placez les plantes &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur
dans un endroit frais. Ce repos ne nuira pas &agrave; la plupart
des plantes, en fait elles en b&eacute;n&eacute;ficieront.
<P>
Lorsque la croissance de nouvelles feuilles reprendra, arrosez
r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement et fertilisez &agrave; l'aide d'un
engrais soluble &agrave; l'eau, tel que l'Engrais Instant Vigoro
20-20-20.
<P>
C'est le moment id&eacute;al de transplanter les plantes dans
des pots plus gros si vous constatez un feutrage radiculaire,
mais seulement si les racines se heurtent compl&egrave;tement
aux parois du conteneur. Par contre, si les racines poss&egrave;dent
trop d'espace de croissance, les feuilles et les fleurs en souffriront.
<P>
M&eacute;fiez-vous aussi du dommage que les insectes peuvent causer
aux plantes d'int&eacute;rieur, surtout les plantes que vous avez
d&eacute;m&eacute;nag&eacute; de l'ext&eacute;rieur apr&egrave;s
la saison de croissance estivale. Souvent un savon insecticide
doux enrayera ces insectes nuisibles. Toutefois, si vous &ecirc;tes
incertains, consultez votre centre-jardin.

<h1>Le Plan d'am&eacute;nagement de jardin:</h1>
<h2>Un projet d'hiver tr&egrave;s valable.</h2>
<img src="gplant.gif">
</center>
<P>
Voil&agrave; la meilleure fa&ccedil;on d'obtenir un jardin superbe.
<P>
&Ecirc;tes-vous parmi ceux qui sont toujours impatients de se
rendre au centre-jardin, &agrave; la recherche de plantes chaque
printemps? Le genre de personne qui &quot;remplit le chariot et
proc&egrave;de &agrave; la plantation sans avoir &eacute;tabli
un plan d'am&eacute;nagement de jardin?&quot;
<P>
Vous n'&ecirc;tes pas le seul, tout comme vous avez pu le constater
d'apr&egrave;s les autres clients que vous rencontrez ici. Mais
vous avez pu aussi constater que ce genre de jardinage peut causer
des ennuis. Certaines plantes ne croissent pas n&eacute;cessairement
comme vous le croyez ... ou elles deviennent trop grosses, trop
vite. Ou bien, vous obtenez beaucoup de fleurs dans un endroit,
ensuite tr&egrave;s peu durant le restant de la saison.
<P>
Il existe une solution &agrave; ces probl&egrave;mes: il s'agit
de dresser un PLAN D'AM&Eacute;NAGEMENT DE VOTRE JARDIN, et c'est
la meilleure fa&ccedil;on d'assurer un jardin qui vous procurera
beaucoup de jouissance. Les mois d'hiver repr&eacute;sentent le
moment id&eacute;al pour songer &agrave; l'allure que vous d&eacute;sirez
cr&eacute;er dans votre jardin l'&eacute;t&eacute; prochain et
pour &eacute;tablir votre plan d'am&eacute;nagement. Un bon plan
d'am&eacute;nagement de jardin d&eacute;bute avec quelques informations-cl&eacute;s,
et &agrave; partir de ceci, le plan est &eacute;labor&eacute;.
Voici ce que vous devez conna&icirc;tre avant de choisir vos plantes:
<P>
<B>Quelle est la condition du sol?</B>
<P>
Le sol doit-il &ecirc;tre am&eacute;lior&eacute; avant de faire
cro&icirc;tre certaines      plantes? Si vous &ecirc;tes incertains,
effectuez une analyse du sol.
<P>
<B>Quelle quantit&eacute; de lumi&egrave;re obtiendra votre jardin?</B>
<P>
La quantit&eacute; de lumi&egrave;re varie aux diff&eacute;rents
endroits autour de     votre maison. Vous pourrez alors tirer
avantage de ces             renseignements lors de la s&eacute;lection
des plantes.
<P>
<B>Quel effet recherchez-vous dans votre jardin?</B>
<P>
D&eacute;sirez-vous une plate-bande qui encadre la pelouse? Une
myriade   de couleurs toute l'ann&eacute;e longeant l'all&eacute;e
pour pi&eacute;tons? Un        jardin r&eacute;gulier ou paysager?
Des plantes basses ou hautes?
<P>
<B>Quel niveau de soins d'entretien d&eacute;sirez-vous?</B>
<P>
Voulez-vous un jardin de plantes vivaces qui n'exigera       
     &eacute;ventuellement aucun entretien ou un jardin qui, &agrave;
chaque          printemps, donne place &agrave; quelques nouvelles
plantes annuelles      vari&eacute;es?
<P>
La meilleure fa&ccedil;on de proc&eacute;der est de bien mesurer
tous les espaces et de r&eacute;diger un croquis de votre (vos)
jardin(s), pr&eacute;f&eacute;rablement sur une feuille de papier
quadrill&eacute;. Ajoutez des notes &agrave; ce croquis, au sujet
des endroits ensoleill&eacute;s et ombrag&eacute;s, humides ou
secs, et si le sol est sablonneux, limoneux ou argileux. 
<P>
Les livres et les revues repr&eacute;sentent une merveilleuse
source d'id&eacute;es &agrave; ce stage.
<P>
Maintenant que vous poss&eacute;dez une id&eacute;e approximative
du genre de jardin que vous voulez, le temps est id&eacute;al
pour obtenir l'aide du personnel averti chez votre centre-jardin.
Apportez votre croquis ainsi que vos notes pour pouvoir expliquer
vos id&eacute;es d&egrave;s le d&eacute;but de votre visite. La
quantit&eacute; de renseignements pratiques qu'ils pourront partager
avec vous, pour am&eacute;liorer votre plan, vous &eacute;tonnera.
<P>
Sur le plan, diviser chaque jardin en petits endroits qui contiennent
5 &agrave; 6 esp&egrave;ces v&eacute;g&eacute;tales et commencer
&agrave; inscrire vos choix. G&eacute;n&eacute;ralement, les plantes
plus grosses et plus hautes sont plac&eacute;es &agrave; l'arri&egrave;re
et les plantes plus petites, &agrave; l'avant. &Eacute;vitez de
surcharger afin de permettre suffisamment d'espace pour la croissance
de chaque plante. Placez les plantes ayant la m&ecirc;me exigence
de croissance ensemble et tentez de placer les plantes afin d'obtenir
une floraison &agrave; diff&eacute;rents endroits, du printemps
&agrave; l'automne.
<P>
Une fois que votre plan est compl&eacute;t&eacute;, dressez une
liste du genre et du nombre de plantes exig&eacute;es. Maintenant,
place &agrave; la partie amusante ... l'achat et la plantation
de votre jardin.
<P>
Votre plan n'a pas besoin d'&ecirc;tre la d&eacute;cision ou l'allure
finale de votre jardin. Vous pourrez toujours repiquer et r&eacute;am&eacute;nager
les plantes pour rehausser l'apparence dans le futur ou quand
les plantes devront &ecirc;tre divis&eacute;es. Et vous trouverez
toujours vos visites chez votre centre-jardin b&eacute;n&eacute;fiques
durant les diff&eacute;rents temps de la saison pour observer
la p&eacute;riode de floraison de diverses plantes... et pour
ajouter une plante ici et l&agrave; dans votre jardin, si vous
le d&eacute;sirez. 
<P>
Une fois que votre jardin est am&eacute;nag&eacute;, il vous sera
peut-&ecirc;tre utile de conserver un journal ou une photo des
changements que vous planifiez pour l'ann&eacute;e suivante.

<TITLE>Le sel d'hiver contitue une menace potentielle pour la pelouse et le jardin</title>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor="FFFFFF">
<center><img src="vigsmall.gif"><hr>
<h1>Le sel d'hiver contitue une menace potentielle pour la pelouse et le jardin</h1>
</center>
<P>
Par contre, il existe des moyens pour diminuer les ennuis.
<P>
L'arriv&eacute;e de la neige et de la glace entra&icirc;ne une
autre incidence environnementale nuisible: le sel.
<P>
Chaque hiver, les &eacute;quipes d'entretien routier et les municipalit&eacute;s
utilisent des tonnes de ce min&eacute;ral agressif sur les rues,
les parcs de stationnement et les trottoirs. La plupart des gens
reconnaissent le sel comme &eacute;tant un probl&egrave;me nuisible.
Par contre, m&ecirc;me si ce min&eacute;ral endommage les voitures,
il offre un &eacute;l&eacute;ment de s&eacute;curit&eacute; routi&egrave;re
pour tous ceux qui doivent naviguer les rues et les trottoirs
glac&eacute;s durant l'hiver, en faisant fondre l'accumulation
de glace.
<P>
De plus, plusieurs propri&eacute;taires utilisent du sel sur les
all&eacute;es pour pi&eacute;tons, les marches d'escalier et les
all&eacute;es d'acc&egrave;s au garage afin d'am&eacute;liorer
la traction.
<P>
<B>Les effets du sel sur l'environnement</B>
<P>
Le sel repr&eacute;sente plusieurs incidences nuisibles autour
de la maison. Sur le b&eacute;ton, l'eau de fonte de la neige
peut p&eacute;n&eacute;trer les crevasses superficielles, ensuite
regeler et s'expanser pour enfin endommager la surface.
<P>
Les incidences sur le sol et les plantes sont encore plus nuisibles.
Le chlorure de calcium, un produit chimique couramment utilis&eacute;
pour fabriquer des fondants, poss&egrave;de des propri&eacute;t&eacute;s
hygroscopiques. Lorsque ce produit est &eacute;pandu sur la pelouse
ou la v&eacute;g&eacute;tation, il absorbe l'humidit&eacute; de
la plante et la d&eacute;shydrate jusqu'&agrave; ce qu'elle soit
br&ucirc;l&eacute;e.
<P>
L'accumulation de sel dans le sol peut cr&eacute;er un risque
de toxicit&eacute; pour les racines des plantes et des effets
n&eacute;fastes &agrave; long terme.
<P>
<B>Des alternatives &eacute;cologiques</B>
<P>
Les propri&eacute;taires pr&eacute;occup&eacute;s par les effets
du sel peuvent se r&eacute;jouir car il existe de nouvelles options.
Ces produits &eacute;liminent non seulement les risques environnementaux,
mais ils att&eacute;nuent mieux la glace. 
<P>
Les fondants de bonne qualit&eacute;, tels que le Fondant &agrave;
glace Safe Step ou le Fondant &agrave; glace de Vigoro, utilisent
un m&eacute;lange d'ingr&eacute;dients qui pr&eacute;viennent
mieux l'accumulation de glace et offrent une meilleure traction
&agrave; des temp&eacute;ratures en bas de 
<P>
-20&#176;C que les produits de sel gemme. 
<P>
Ils att&eacute;nuent et pr&eacute;viennent l'accumulation de glace
pour des p&eacute;riodes de temps plus longues, permettent moins
de cycle de gel-d&eacute;gel et r&eacute;duisent le dommage du
b&eacute;ton.
<P>
Et ils sont plus &eacute;cologiques pour la pelouse, les arbustes
et les autres plantes que le chlorure de calcium. De fait, quelques
uns poss&egrave;dent m&ecirc;me des &eacute;l&eacute;ments nutritifs
b&eacute;n&eacute;fiques pour les plantes, tels que l'azote et
la potasse.
<P>
Ces fondants offrent aussi d'autres avantages. Ils sont moins
nuisibles sur les planchers et les tapis car ils ne laissent aucun
r&eacute;sidu huileux ou salissant. Ils poss&egrave;dent une meilleure
long&eacute;vit&eacute; d'entreposage lorsqu'ils sont entrepos&eacute;s
dans des endroits humides tels que les garages parce qu'ils ne
se d&eacute;composent pas et n'absorbent pas l'humidit&eacute;.
Et ils sont plus s&eacute;curitaires &agrave; manipuler que le
sel et ne n&eacute;cessitent pas le port de gants protecteurs
ou de lunettes de protection.
<P>
Dans la plupart des cas, ces avantages n&eacute;cessitent un prix
plus &eacute;lev&eacute;. Ces nouveaux fondants co&ucirc;tent
plus chers que les produits &agrave; base de sel. Par contre,
plusieurs &eacute;tablissements, municipalit&eacute;s et entreprises
qui les utilisent pr&eacute;tendent que le co&ucirc;t est moindre
parce que ces produits causent moins de dommage environnemental
et offrent une traction de plus longue dur&eacute;e.
<P>
Utilisez ces fondants &eacute;cologiques et d'autres m&eacute;thodes
de protection contre l'hiver tels que les paraneiges pour prot&eacute;ger
les arbustes, ainsi que le paillis et la fertilisation d'automne
pour aider les plantes et la pelouse &agrave; mieux hiverner.
Vous constaterez que ces produits de protection vous offrirons
un meilleur environnement le printemps suivant.

<h1>Produits pour soins de la pelouse</h1>
</center>
<br>
Quand il s'agit de bien soigner la pelouse, la ligne d'engrais
pour pelouse de qualit&eacute; Vigoro est imbattable. Chaque formulation
est con&ccedil;ue seulement d'ingr&eacute;dients de premi&egrave;re
qualit&eacute;, scientifiquement m&eacute;lang&eacute;s pour les
besoins particuliers de la pelouse durant la saison de croissance.
<P>
Toutefois, il existe un &eacute;l&eacute;ment nutritif qui distingue
Golden Vigoro parmi tout autre; l'agent IBDU&#174;, l'azote &agrave;
lib&eacute;ration contr&ocirc;l&eacute;e. Tout simplement, aucun
autre produit peut fournir de l'azote &agrave; la pelouse d'une
fa&ccedil;on plus contr&ocirc;l&eacute;e et pour une aussi longue
dur&eacute;e. La caract&eacute;ristique unique de l'azote IBDU&#174;
est due au fait que la lib&eacute;ration est bas&eacute;e sur
l'hydrolyse: l'eau est l'&eacute;l&eacute;ment-cl&eacute; qui
d&eacute;clenche la lib&eacute;ration d'azote. Toutefois, l'agent
IBDU est 1000 fois moins soluble que les sources d'azote habituelles,
alors quelque soit le volume d'eau pr&eacute;sent, l'agent IBDU
fournit une alimentation uniforme durant une p&eacute;riode de

<TITLE>Achieving Competition in the Liberalised Telecommunications Market</TITLE>
<BODY bgcolor=#FFFFFF>
<center><IMG SRC=telecom.gif>
<h1>Achieving Competition in<br>the Liberalised Telecommunications Market<br>Executive Summary</h1>
<HR size=3>
</center>

<OL><LI>The liberalisation of the fixed telephone network in July 1995 marked a turning point in the development of the telecommunications market. It was the most important evidence of the Government's commitment to competition rather than monopoly provision as the best way forward for the industry and Hong Kong.
<p><LI>The issue of three new Fixed Telecommunications Network Service (FTNS) licences  is, however, very much a beginning.  Unlike the deregulation of the telecommunications industry in other countries, deregulation of the fixed network has not been accompanied by liberalisation of the international telecommunications market, which is only due to take place in 2006.
<p><LI>The Consumer Council welcomes what has been achieved to date - the liberalisation of the FTNS market and development of a competitive retail market for the provision of mobile, Internet, and other value-added services; and the establishment of the Office of the Telecommunications Authority (OFTA). 
<p><LI>We believe that competition will: bring about productive and allocative efficiency; increase consumer choice;  reduce prices; and improve quality.
<p><LI>At this early stage of liberalisation, the dominant fixed network operator still accounts for 99% of basic telephone services and 88% of outgoing  international calls<I>(Note 1)</I>.  </OL>
</ol>

<B>Objectives of the study</B>
<p><ol start=6><li>Telecommunications services are a major utility in Hong Kong.  In view of the major changes undergone by the industry, this study aims to:
<OL TYPE=a><LI>examine competition issues arising from the transformation in the local Fixed Telecommunications Network Services (FTNS) market as the monopoly provider gives way to multiple suppliers; 
<LI>identify barriers to competition; and
<LI>make recommendations to promote effective competition and maximise benefits to consumers.</OL>  
<p><li>The study focuses on the need to maintain momentum in the opening up of the fixed network market, and on ways to promote competition in international retail tariffs given the continuing monopoly on the processing of incoming and outgoing international traffic.  
</ol>

<B>The FTNS market</B>
<p><OL start=8><P><LI>A local fixed network, which is a 'public switching telecommunications network' (PSTN) connecting to almost all residential and business premises,  is by far the most important part of the infrastructure for most forms of telecommunications services.  The cellular network, which has established a strong market presence in recent years, serves as a complement to, rather than a direct substitute for, a fixed network.  It remains to be seen whether Personal Communication Services (PCS) will be in direct competition with FTNS.
<P><LI>Consumers and service providers have to have access to a PSTN in order to receive and provide services (or usage) through the network.
<P><LI>Before liberalisation, all consumers and service providers had to rely on only one network owned by Hong Kong Telephone Co Ltd (HKTC) and pay HKTC an access fee (Appendix 1).  The fees include:
<p><OL TYPE=a><LI>Local tariffs<br>Currently, consumers pay $65 per residential line and $98 per business line.  This includes access and free usage of basic voice services.   As part of a package of tariff reforms, the Government introduced limits or 'price caps' on the amount by which HKTC can increase local tariffs, while requiring international tariffs to decrease by a certain percentage within a prescribed period<I>(Note 2)</I>.
<LI>Interconnection charges<br>Value-added service (VAS) providers, e.g. mobile operators, pay an interconnection charge (or access charge) of 9 cents per minute.  This allows them to provide services to consumers on HKTC's network.
<LI>Delivery fees<br>The international carrier, Hong Kong Telecom International Ltd (HKTI), must have access to the HKTC network in order to deliver international calls from and to consumers.  The access charge paid by HKTI is often referred to as the delivery fee, which is determined on a revenue-sharing basis.</OL>

<P><li>Following liberalisation, three new operators, Hutchison Communications Limited (HCL), New T&T Hong Kong Limited (NT&T) and New World Telephone Company Limited (NWT) have begun building an alternative network to compete with one another and HKTC for local customers, contracts with service providers and for the delivery of international calls (Appendix 2).  They also compete in the provision of value-added services.
<P><li>In order to fulfil their licence conditions, the three new FTNS operators are obliged to build a trunk network by 29 December 1996. They are currently negotiating with the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) company to  build a network along the MTR lines.  With new technologies such as fibre optics, the cost of building a network is much reduced and the installation causes much less disturbance than was previously the case.  Nevertheless, the new network will take some time to roll out and will not provide full coverage throughout the territory.  The new FTNS operators have to rely on interconnection with HKTC's network to provide services to their customers, for which they pay HKTC interconnection charges.  Therefore interconnection between the FTNS operators is an important issue at this early stage of liberalisation.
<P><li>There is no  legal reason why competition for local fixed network services  cannot be introduced, bringing with it  more choice for consumers.  However, for commercial reasons, the FTNS operators have concentrated on other activities  e.g. international and value-added services,  which are more profitable.
<P><li>In this competition study, the Consumer Council looks at barriers that may prevent the development of competition in certain markets.  We take as our guiding principle the requirement for:
<OL TYPE=a><LI>increased efficiency;
<LI>non-discriminatory practice;
<LI>disclosure and transparency of information;
<LI>air and reasonable tariffs and interconnection charges;
<LI>an equitable arrangement for the provision of universal service; and
<LI>reasonable regulatory safeguards.</OL>
</OL>

<B>Challenges for new entrants to the FTNS Market</B>
<p><ol start=15><li>The new entrants have to overcome significant market and structural barriers in order to offer a viable fixed network service.  The key challenges facing new entrants to the FTNS market are:
<OL TYPE=a><LI>the competitive advantage of the incumbent in the control of the existing network; and
<LI>organisational integration between related companies of the incumbent in different telecommunications markets. </OL>
</ol>

<B>Competitive advantages</B>
<p><ol start=16><li>KTC has inherited obvious advantages: comprehensive network coverage, economies of scale and large customer base. 
<p><li>The near universal coverage of the network gives HKTC control of gateways between networks for which it can make interconnection charges.  Ownership of gateways also allows HKTC to determine the capacity passing through a particular line or network.
<p><li>In terms of building a network, new entrants may have difficulties in finding suitable sites for local exchanges particularly in developed areas.  The incumbent by contrast, already has sites on which to accommodate its local exchanges, most of which are leased through private treaty grants from the Government.  In these circumstances, <I>the Consumer Council supports</I> the Government policy to facilitate sharing of land for local exchanges equitably between operators.  <I>The Council recommends</I> that the Government, in consultation with industry, continues to monitor the FTNS operators' discussions on the sharing of facilities so that the agreement reached to facilitate an equitable access to sites for local exchange among all parties.
<p><li>In terms of building a customer base, it is important that consumers are able to change operator without having to change telephone numbers (number portability).  The Consumer Council commends OFTA's role in introducing number portability to the liberalisation process.  To increase its convenience to consumers, number portability should be delivered in an efficient manner, and there should be no discriminatory and preferential treatment. New operators, nevertheless, have to offer something extra, for example, reduced charges or value added services, in order to persuade consumers to go to the trouble of changing operator. Although their ability to reduce costs is constrained by the tariff structure inherited from the single supplier period, new entrants are striving to reduce costs through improved efficiency.
</ol>

<B>Organisational integration</B>

<p><ol start=20><li>HKTC competes with the new FTNS operators in the provision of services, but is also a major supplier of essential network facilities to the new entrants and information and value-added service providers.
<p><li>As part of an international conglomerate dealing in various spheres of telecommunications business, e.g. infrastructure provision, international and domestic telephone services, HKTC inevitably enjoys an advantage over the new FTNS operators.  The Telecommunications Authority (TA), who is the Director General of OFTA,  has already required HKT  to divide its functions and maintain separate accounts for each of its companies in accordance with the TA's Accounting Manual.  The affiliate companies must deal with each other at arm's-length.  In practice, HKTC still enjoys a competitive advantage from the close connection with other HKT affiliates, especially in the sharing of information, product development research, and the provision of  network facilities essential for the distribution of services to customers.
<p><li><I>The Consumer Council suggests</I> that the TA requires reasonable disclosure of the accounts of HKT and its affiliate companies to enable the public to have a more informed view.  
<p><li><I>The Consumer Council also sees a need</I> for the TA to exercise its power to facilitate the sharing of information, e.g. network technology plans for interconnection, provided that the information is not commercially sensitive. The TA should also ensure that services, particularly in areas where a telecommunications conglomerate has monopoly or near-monopoly power, are available to all licensees on a non-discriminatory basis, i.e. that there should be no discriminatory or preferential treatment in the price, quality, availability and efficiency of the services offered by any telecommunications operators to their affiliates or other companies.
</ol>

<B>Factors affecting the development of competition</B>
<p><ol start=24><li>The extent of competition also depends very much on the arrangements in the following areas:-
<OL TYPE=a><LI>tariff structure for local and international calls;
<LI>universal service obligation;
<LI>interconnection arrangements.</OL>
</ol>

<B>The tariff structure</B>
<p><ol start=25><li>The Consumer Council has been informed by Hongkong Telecom and the Government, local tariffs are artificially set below cost and are subsidised from international revenue.  The new FTNS operators regard the local tariffs  as too low to provide an incentive to compete in the market.  Nevertheless, certain operators have provided basic services for businesses at a lower price than that charged by HKTC.
<p><li>This raises the following two questions: (a) what is the basis on which the subsidy from international to local services is calculated; and (b) is there a need to remove such a subsidy in order to bring both local and international tariffs closer to costs (a process described as tariff rebalancing).
</ol>

<B>Extent of subsidy</B>
<p><ol start=27><li>The amount of cross-subsidy, often referred to as the "access deficit", is the shortfall between the revenue collected from local tariffs and the expenses incurred by HKTC in providing a basic service and fulfilling its universal service obligation (paras 30-34 below refer). The amount of subsidy, however, is unknown to the public. <I>The Consumer Council therefore recommends</I> that OFTA should ensure the amount of access deficit including the methodology used in allocating fixed and common costs to different services offered by HKTC and its depreciation policies, is publicly available.  This will enable the public to understand how much of the international revenue transferred to HKTC has been used to cross-subsidise local basic telephone services.
</ol>

<B>Tariff rebalancing</B>
<p><ol start=28><li>Assuming there is a subsidy, we have to consider whether, as a matter of policy, Hong Kong should proceed with tariff rebalancing.  If so, when and how.
<p><li>In a fully liberalised market, charges for international and local calls would be determined by market forces, and consumers as a whole would derive long-term benefit from the lower prices of telephone calls due to competition. However, Hong Kong's case is unique in that deregulation of the telecommunications market did not extend to international telecommunications. For consumers, tariff rebalancing means that as the subsidy, if any, is removed, local tariffs may be increased, while international tariffs reduced. The full benefit to consumers from tariff rebalancing will be realised only when full and fair competition comes into play. However, the liberalised FTNS market is still in the early stages of development and will take some time to bring about competition. 
<p><li><I>The Consumer Council maintains</I> that consumer interests must be protected and that, in the present situation where there is no clear and concrete information indicating how consumers may benefit, tariff rebalancing should remain as a long-term objective, phased in along with the realisation of effective competition in the market.
</ol>

<B>Restructuring of local tariffs</B>
<p><ol start=31><li>Restructuring of local tariffs is another issue of critical concern to the consumer.  The Council is conducting its own analysis of possible options, but needs more cost and price information to make a full assessment of the financial and social implications for consumers. The Government will shortly be issuing a consultation paper on various alternative structures of local tariffs.  The Consumer Council will provide its views once it has such further information.  
</ol>

<B>Universal Service Obligation (USO)</B>
<p><ol start=32><li>Under the current arrangement, HKTC has an obligation to provide a basic telephone service (access and voice usage) to all who request it.  HKTC charges these customers a uniform rate for telephone installation and flat monthly rental, even if HKTC incurs a loss in doing so.  This is known as the universal service obligation.  The new entrants, who do not carry such an obligation, have to contribute by paying  HKTC an amount known as the Access Deficit Contribution (ADC), which now stands at 35.8 cents per minute of international call<I>(Note 3)</I>.
<p><li>The amount of ADC not only includes the actual cost of universal service but also a share of the cross-subsidisation from international revenue to HKTC for keeping its local tariffs at a low level. Even though OFTA is committed to replace ADC with a Universal Service Contribution (USC) after the current ADC expires on 31 July 1996, there is an obvious need to separate and reveal the amount of two elements: cross-subsidies and the cost of the USO. 
<p><li><I>The Consumer Council recommends</I> that an independent Universal Service Fund should be established and managed by OFTA, with every FTNS operator contributing an equitable share.   OFTA should also explore other means of allowing the operators to share the Universal Service Obligation, in order to give the new entrants some incentive to provide basic services to consumers.  For example, OFTA can identify some "uneconomic areas" and invite all FTNS operator to bid by stating the amount of subsidy they would require from the Universal Service Fund for providing this service.
<p><li><I>The Consumer Council also recommends</I> that OFTA should separate clearly the cost of universal service provision from the cross-subsidisation from international revenue to HKTC.  OFTA should examine other pricing methods for the calculation of universal service costs, for example, the Long-run Average Incremental Costs (LRAICs) method (used in Australia and the U.K) or other alternative methods.  The calculation should take into account the separate costs for the provision of access and usage.
<p><li>There is also a question as to how the cost of the USO should be shared. Currently the main source of Universal Service funds is international revenue.  In view of the growing revenue generated from information and value-added services which also make use of the network, a new and equitable funding arrangement needs to be found.  <I>The Consumer Council therefore recommends</I> that OFTA expands the source of universal funding to include the growing number of value-added services.
</ol>

<B>Interconnection arrangements</B>
<p><B>Customer interconnection</B>
<p><ol start=37><li>Interconnection between customers and FTNS operators is vital if consumers are to have access to the services offered by the operator of their choice.  There may be some consumers who cannot be directly connected to new operators because (a) the new FTNS operators will take a number of years to roll out their services; and (b) there is no room for the new FTNS operators to install cabling inside  their existing office building or residential block.  In that case operators will have to continue to rely on interconnection via the existing cable or 'local loop' owned by HKTC.  Access to the local loop (known as 'type II interconnection'), and the terms on which it is available are therefore of crucial importance in ensuring fair competition and consumer access in the near future. The development of new technology such as cordless access systems, may reduce the need for type II interconnection in the long term.
<p><li><I>The Consumer Council recommends</I> that HKTC should allow new entrants to interconnect with its local loop at a price (Type II Interconnection).  Interconnection being such a critical issue in competition, OFTA should have the power to determine as necessary such that this price must be set at a reasonable level, in the consumer's interest, and that it will enhance the competitiveness of the new entrants and also encourage investment in network infrastructure. <I>The Consumer Council recommends</I> that Guidelines<I>(Note 4)</I> for new buildings, requiring developers to provide ducts and reasonable space for telecommunications facilities and to allow non-exclusive free access by all network operators, should be given statutory force through amending the Telecommunication Ordinance or the Buildings Ordinance. The TA should also discuss with the Building Authority, relevant Government departments, the professional institutions and Real Estates Developers' Associations design details to be stipulated in the law and to exclude floor space reserved for such telecommunications facilities from the plot ratio of building projects.<I>(Note 5)</I>
<p><li><I>The Consumer Council also recommends</I> that the TA should take measures to increase public awareness of provisions for non-discriminatory access and publicise its powers to deal with complaints about denial of access to operators by owners' corporations or by a conglomerate giving favourable treatment to its associate telecommunication companies.
</ol>

<B>Network interconnection</B>
<p><ol start=40><li>Interconnection or access charges constitute a major portion of the operating costs of the new FTNS operators, information and value-added service providers.  Hence, their competitive edge and commercial viability  are very sensitive to the level of charges.  These charges are also of public interest, as consumers ultimately have to bear the cost.
<p><li>The Government's policy is to allow terms and conditions of interconnection to be determined by commercial agreement.  If agreement cannot be reached, or the TA considers the terms and conditions reached to be anti-competitive and against the public interest, the TA has the power to determine the terms and conditions itself.<I>(Note 6)</I>
<p><li>Currently all service providers e.g. FTNS, PMRS and Internet operators<I>(Note 7)</I>, pay a 9 cents per minute charge to access HKTC's network for incoming and outgoing traffic.  This amount was determined by the TA and appears to have been based on the charge for a multiple-to-multiple point of voice message interconnection such as that applied to mobile operators.  <I>The Consumer Council asks the TA to consider</I>, at an appropriate review point, whether the simpler one-to-multiple point of electrical data interconnection by FTNS and  Internet providers to the HKTC network should be charged on the same basis.
<p><li>When the terms and conditions are determined by the TA, as in the case of the 9 cents per minute charge discusses above, or delivery fees received by the local operators in carrying international calls, the public can find out about the charges and the rationale behind them. However, terms and conditions reached under commercial negotiation are not disclosed to the public, even though some of the terms may be of public concern.  <I>The Consumer Council therefore suggests</I> that the TA  makes the terms and conditions of interconnection between FTNS operators and between FTNS operators and HKTI available for public consumption, provided that the information disclosed is not commercially sensitive.
</ol>

<B>International telecommunications</B>
<p><ol start=44><li>Hong Kong's case is unique in that liberalisation of the telecommunications market did not extend to international telecommunications.  The international call market will not be fully open to competition until 2006, when HKTI's exclusive franchise is due to expire.  HKTI relies on the FTNS operators and PMRS network to deliver the calls to and from consumers.  
<p><li>Competition has been developing at the retail level with call-back services, in particular, opening new avenues of competition.  While HKTC delivers most incoming calls, its share of the outgoing call market has fallen to 88%, with other FTNS and PMRS operators accounting for 7% and call-back operators 5% of the market share. Thus consumers have some choice and lower tariffs for international calls.  
<p><li>New operators' ability to reduce tariffs is constrained by the amount of delivery fee they receive from HKTI on a revenue-sharing basis and the Access Deficit Contribution (ADC).  The delivery fee is the per minute revenue share received by local operators. The rest of the revenue share goes to HKTI covering its operating costs, profits and net payments to overseas operators for delivering international calls.  And the amount of net payment to overseas operators depends on the settlement rates (the 'accounting rates'), which are the result of HKTI's bilateral negotiations with its overseas counterparts.
<p><li>In the remaining ten years of HKTI's exclusive franchise, the Consumer Council believes that it is important for the Government to make strenuous efforts to safeguard consumer welfare.  The Consumer Council welcomes the move undertaken by the TA to clearly define the coverage of HKTI's exclusive franchise and to examine whether International Simple Resale (ISR) is consistent with HKTI's franchise. 
<p><li>To protect public interests in HKTI's bilateral negotiations with overseas operators over accounting rates, <I>the Consumer Council sees a need</I> for closer liaison between Government and HKTI. In the event that OFTA finds the accounting rates negotiated not to be in the public interest of Hong Kong, OFTA should ask HKTI to explain.
</ol>

<B>Ensuring consumer welfare</B>
<p><ol start=49><li>A more competitive market does not automatically guarantee to deliver all the benefits the consumer should enjoy, and regulatory safeguards will be needed to ensure a universal service of acceptable quality to all customers.
</ol>

<B>Achieving affordability and accessibility</B>
<p><ol start=50><li>The study supports the Government's declared policy on universal service to enable consumers anywhere in the territory to receive basic and emergency services within a reasonable period of time.  In view of rapid technological advances, <I>the Consumer Council recommends</I> that OFTA reviews and expands as necessary, the definition of services which can be regarded as basic.  In particular, the needs of consumers for whom the telephone is a lifeline, should be given special consideration,  as telephone services have become a major utility. This Council welcomes Government's move to set aside $50M to install telephone for families under the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance Scheme.<I>(Note 8)</I>
</ol>

<B>Ensuring quality for consumers</B>
<p><ol start=51><li>While liberalisation of the fixed network provides consumer choice, the Consumer Council believes that certain regulatory measures and oversight will be necessary to enhance the quality of basic services.  The Consumer Council welcomes the FTNS licence condition requiring FTNS operators to have a customer charter.  <I>The Consumer Council recommends</I> that operators should be obliged to publish such a charter on a regular basis In addition, <I>the Consumer Council recommends</I> that OFTA reviews the operators' performance targets from a consumer perspective and formulates a standard reporting format for all operators.  Automatic compensation schemes, and proper publicity for them, should be encouraged wherever possible.
</ol>

<B>Regulatory safeguards against anti-competitive practices</B>
<p><ol start=52><li>The Consumer Council commends the competition provisions in the FTNS licences, setting out the ground rules for fair competition. Other telecommunications service operators, e.g. HKTI, have no similar provisions in their franchise/licences.
<p><li>The provisions are broad and liable to subjective determination by the TA.  This is not dissimilar with the U.K. telecommunications regulator. In addition to being a regulator, the TA has taken on the role of  arbiter on competition matters. As Hong Kong does not have an independent, general competition agency, the possibility remains that the regulator might be caught between having to enforce anti-competition provisions and preserving the well-being of the industry. 
<p><li>ar as sanctions against breaches of the competitive provisions are concerned, the Consumer Council sees certain limitations in the provisions.  For example, the current financial penalties (a maximum amount of $20,000 for the first occasion, $50,000 for the second occasion, and $100,000 for any subsequent occasion) are limited.  The ultimate sanction - revocation of licence - may not be practicable.
<p><li><I>The Consumer Council recommends</I> that competition provisions should also be applied to international service and other telecommunications service operators, and enshrined in the proposed comprehensive telecommunications legislation.  <I>The Council also recommends</I> that the penalties for breaches of the competition provisions are set at levels where they act as an effective deterrent; and in appropriate circumstances, that third parties be given the right to seek redress for breach of these provisions. 
<p><li>The study reveals the advantage to the TA, the telecommunications industry and third parties, in having a general competition agency in Hong Kong  to complement and underpin the current industry-specific competition provisions.  Justification for introducing such an agency will be examined in detail in the Council's main report on Competition Policy.
</ol>

<B>Policy development responsibilities</B>
<p><ol start=57><li>Recognising the convergence of broadcasting, telecommunications and communication technology, <I>the Consumer Council reaffirms</I> its earlier recommendation for integration of policy development responsibility for these areas under a Secretary for Broadcasting, Telecommunications  and Communications Technology.<I>(Note 9)</I>
<p><li>Under the proposal, the regulatory role of OFTA, headed by the TA should remain unchanged in order to implement the Government's telecommunications policy.  At present, GIC makes regulations which OFTA then implements.  It is important that OFTA retains responsibility for dealing with issues affecting the development of effective competition in the industry, e.g. interconnection arrangements, in the initial period of liberalisation.
<p><li>In order to keep abreast with technological advances and changing market structure, <I>the Consumer Council sees the need for</I> comprehensive telecommunications legislation providing clear guidance for market players.  <I>The Consumer Council recommends</I> that the Government should, in its proposed comprehensive Telecommunications Ordinance, clearly define the TA's responsibilities and ensure that the TA has sufficient power to carry out its responsibilities.  At present, the TA seeks representation from the industry and members of the public before making its determination on competition and technical matters and publishes its determination for public consumption.  It is advisable to include such consultative procedures in the legislation and ensure TA's determinations are made available to the public. 
<p><li>We note that OFTA has already set up advisory committees on specific issues. In line with general government administrative and legislative procedures and to provide checks and balances, <I>the Consumer Council recommends</I> that the Government consider setting up an Advisory Board to tender advice to TA on key telecommunications issues.
</ol>

<p><b>The Consumer Council believes that the Government's primary responsibility is to ensure a consistent, long term policy which fosters a fair, open, and progressive environment conducive to investment, competition and development in the telecommunications industry as well as providing an effective legislative and regulatory framework to facilitate the same.  This is the best guarantee for consumers. </b>

<TITLE>Ensuring Competition in the Dynamic Television Broadcasting Market</TITLE>
<BODY bgcolor=#FFFFFF>
<center><IMG SRC=bcast.gif>
<h1>Ensuring Competition in the<br>Dynamic Television Broadcasting Market<br>Executive Summary</h1>
<HR size=3>
</center>
<p>Competition is needed in broadcasting as in other sectors. It will increase choice for consumers and improve Hong Kong's competitiveness.  An environment in which competition can flourish will bring overall economic and community benefits.

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>This study aims to analyse competition within this industry, to see how fair conditions are for competitors in the broadcasting market, identify barriers to competition and ways in which competition can be enhanced for the benefit of the industry while protecting consumer interests.
<p>As the choice available to Hong Kong's consumers through their TV sets now and in future are ultimately affected by broadcasting policy and the regulatory framework, these have become an inevitable part of our study.

<h3>An environment of rapid change</h3>
<p>A series of technological breakthroughs has brought dramatic changes to the broadcasting industry in recent years.  In particular, the number of channels available has multiplied with the transmission of signals by satellite and cable.
<p>With digitalisation and compression techniques, even more channels can become available.  We believe the pace of change is likely to continue at its current rapid rate and that Hong Kong needs to be ready for the future. This will call for forward looking regulation and a streamlined administrative regime.

<h3>Forward-looking regulation</h3>
<p>At present, regulation is couched in terms of the three existing broadcasting technologies, namely, terrestrial, cable and satellite, and the way in which services are paid for.  It will be increasingly difficult for such technologically or payment mode specific regulation to keep abreast of technological developments. There is an increasing global trend towards the merging of television, telecommunications and communication technologies.
<p>Hong Kong needs to ensure that the regulatory framework will meet the challenge presented by the ever more complex and innovative broadcasting environment and provide a level playing field for market players.
<p>We recognise that some safeguards are necessary to prevent market dominance, protect local and minority interests and maintain reasonable broadcasting standards.

<p>We specifically recommend that:
<UL TYPE=disc><LI>the regulatory framework should be based on a clear conceptual division between the carrier and programme or service providers.  The two activities should be separately regulated and should provide the flexibility to accommodate changes without requiring major amendments each time a new form of technology or service comes on stream;
<p><LI>carrier licences should prescribe transmission standards, which should be technologically neutral;
<p><LI>programme/service licences should ensure compliance with programme and advertising standards and give permission to operate a subscription service, where applicable;
<p><ul>programme/service providers must also satisfy the prevailing requirements for their own activities, e.g. stock brokerage services could only be offered in conjunction with an authorised dealer;</ul>
<p><li>Government should encourage the industry to ensure new technologies are widely available and consumer-friendly so that: 
<p><ul>different services interface in the home and technologies interconnect as much as possible without disproportionate cost and inconvenience to the consumer, e.g. through a single set top box;
<p>property owners and managers are encouraged to comply with the  provisions of the Telecommunication Ordinance by allowing unobstructive access to the service of the Fixed Network Operators;  and
<p>property developers are encouraged to observe Office of the Telecommunications Authority's "Building Access Guidelines" in ensuring access to telecommunication and broadcasting networks in new building new properties;
<p>that "gatekeepers"<I>(Note 1)</I> allow controlled access to different transmission signals at locations fair to network owners and programme service providers.
</ul></ul>

<h3>Promoting more and fair competition</h3>
<p>At present, Hong Kong sees competition between the two terrestrial broadcasters, each operating one Cantonese and one English channel, one satellite and one subscription broadcaster and a public broadcaster, in addition to video rental shops and the cinema. It is our view that competition and consumer choice could be enhanced by:
<UL TYPE=disc><LI>providing greater transparency in the decision making and licensing process i.e. licence conditions are publicly available unless there are explicit justifications for non-disclosure;
<p><li>introducing suitable safeguards to prevent market dominance by multimedia companies;  specifically, 
<p><ul>the Council welcomes the Government's intention to extend cross media ownership restrictions to newspapers;</ul>
<p><li>relaxation of controls on foreign ownership of broadcasting companies, and encouraging investment through:
<p><ul>abolition of controls on foreign ownership of satellite broadcasters, for practical reasons; and
<p>relaxation of the 10% threshold above which Governor-in-Council's approval is required for increases in foreign ownership of voting shares in local broadcasters, with the overall 49% limit on foreign ownership of these voting rights remaining in force.</ul>
<p><li>Recognising convergence of technology and facilitating consumer choice,
<p><ul>by removing the legal incapacity for telecom operators who wish to enter the broadcasting market. This will mean that Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd (HKT) may operate a Video-On-Demand Service with a non-exclusive carrier licence carrying with the obligation to act as a common carrier and may apply for a subscription TV licence.
<p>However, concerns about market dominance should be addressed when assessing the licence application, taking into account the effect on market competition at the time.</ul>
<p><li>giving licensees a clear indication of the circumstances in which the Government will consider renewing their licences or opening the market to new entrants which means : 
<p><ul>the Government should conclude, with no unnecessary delay, its market assessment on the granting of further subscription TV licences, bearing in mind market forces and the competitive environment;</ul>
<p><li>giving statutory force to and improving the provisions against anti-competitive behaviour; 
<p><ul>making them comprehensive enough to serve the purpose for which they are intended for, and 
<p>ensuring the penalties imposed are sufficient to act as an effective deterrent;</ul>
<p><li>rationalising the system of  royalty payments and licence fees of the various broadcasters under a uniform standard which is perceived as being equitable to all licensees as well as transparent to observers.
</ul>

<h3>A  streamlined regime</h3>
<p>We believe that a more robust, coherent and professional lead is needed to steer through the regulatory and legislative changes that are necessary in this dynamic environment, and in the light of the convergence which is taking place.   
<p>We recommend:
<UL TYPE=disc><LI>integration of  responsibility for broadcasting/telecommunications policy under a new Secretary for Broadcasting, Telecom and Communication Technology;
<p><LI>an enlarged Broadcasting Authority (BA)  to allow input from a wide cross-section of the community;
<p><LI>provision of staff with relevant professional and technical expertise for BA and the policy secretary for the new Secretary.
</UL>

<h3>Giving consumers a choice</h3>
<p>With more competition, there might be even greater pressure on commercial operators mainly to provide programmes with mass appeal and neglect minority interests.  We want to ensure broadcasters cater for all tastes and provide a sufficient variety of programmes for viewers' choice.  We recommend:
<UL TYPE=disc><LI>that Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) be given access to Cable TV as well as terrestrial television air time, and continue to operate radio services;
<p><LI>that non-commercial, community relevant TV programmes produced by recognised public and community organisations, for example, Independent Commission Against Corruption, Civic Education and Environmental Publicity Campaign Committees, be made available to the public.
</UL>
<p>Also:
<ul type=disc><li>that RTHK's Memorandum of Understanding with the BA is given statutory force bringing them into line with other broadcasters.
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Broadcasting and communications technology is changing so fast that it is sometimes difficult for regulations to keep abreast of developments in the field.  With the convergence of different carrier modes and types of service and the rapid development of regional broadcasting markets, the opportunities and challenges facing the industry now are greater than they have ever been.  Handled correctly, these developments offer unprecedented benefits for both consumers and Hong Kong business. But we must take care to remove any potential barriers to the introduction of new technology and market growth if Hong Kong is to realise these benefits.

<p>Notes :
<OL><LI>gatekeepers control devices which can receive and decode different encrypted signals, cable, satellite and terrestrial.  A gatekeeper can choose which signals to decode, and hence what is available via their particular decoder.

<P>
<CENTER>******************************</CENTER>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Substandard condoms are a matter of life or death!  For they may result in unwanted pregnancy or the transmission of HIV, the cause of AIDS, as well as other sexually transmitted diseases (STD).

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Consumer Council which has long been concerned with the reliability of condoms, today released its latest test report on the biggest batch of condom samples (30,000) ever conducted on this product since 1988.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The results are as disappointing as they are worrying.  Out of the 95 models marketed under 50 brands in Hong Kong, one-third of them were found to be unsatisfactory posing a potential hazard to their users.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The condoms were subjected to a series of physical tests which measure their likelihood of leakage and breakage.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The samples were sourced from retail outlets in Hong Kong as well as, for the first time, in Shenzhen and Macau.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The results, based largely on ISO 4074-1 (Condom Standard), showed that 16 models were unsatisfactory in the leakage test, 22 models in the air burst test and 12 models in the tensile test.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The worst condoms with the most substandard samples were found in one model with 44 out of 125 samples failing the leakage test (the maximum failure allowed is 1) and another with 61 out of 125 samples failing the bursting pressure test (the maximum failure allowed is 5).

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the results were far from reassuring, consumers can take relief at the outcome that two-thirds of the samples complied with the standard in their physical tests and were considered reliable to use.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of condoms as a means of preventing HIV infection is well established.  Consumers are therefore advised to exercise care in the choice of condoms of good quality.  They can consult the test report in this (242) December issue of the Council's monthly magazine 'CHOICE'.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the samples were 8 models which claimed to contain the spermicide Nonoxynol-9 (N9) in their lubricants (with claimed concentration from 5 percent to 8 percent w/w).

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spermicide N9 was at the centre of a recent controversy in the UK over its effect on the sperm count of the male user and the development of male  reproductive organs of the fetus due to potential exposure to N9 during pregnancy.  The Council will keep in view of the development.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On labelling, only 30 out of 95 condom models were considered satisfactory in accordance with the ISO standard.  Many need  improvement or lack manufacture/expiry date and other required labellings.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Consumer Council has notified, at the first instance, of its test results to the Customs and Excise Department for investigation under the Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance which prohibits the supply of substandard condoms in Hong Kong.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Condom manufacturers are urged to maintain a high standard of quality in their products because of the grave consequences substandard condoms may cause to their users.


<P>
<CENTER>******************************</CENTER>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the cold weather sets in, the Consumer Council has turned its attention to a new emerging market geared to run immediate rescue to the elderly or disabled in distress.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operators offer an round-the-clock standby ready to respond to emergency calls from its clients who can raise the alarm simply at the touch of a button.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Council has conducted a market survey on 9 such service providers --- most are commercially operated and some non-profit organisations.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In moments of emergency, for example, a sudden severe cold spell attack, the elderly or disabled armed with a remote trigger on their body (a pendant or a wrist watch), can swiftly summon help by pressing a button on the device.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will activate a local unit in the house which in turn will act as an auto dialler connecting it to the control centre via the telephone line.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operators at the control centre will establish the caller's identity, monitor the situation and provide the necessary assistance.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this December issue of 'CHOICE' is provided useful and practical information, particularly on (1) features of the local unit and the remote trigger, (2) the supporting service provided by the control centre, and (3) how to choose (whether to buy or lease).

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As local units and remote triggers available in the market vary in features, consumers should heed the following:

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unit must be user friendly, and must not be difficult or confusing to operate as users are mainly the elderly or disabled.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is desirable to have microphone and speaker on the local unit to allow effective two-way communication between the caller and the control centre.

<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <LI>The unit should warn the user and if possible the control centre of power and telephone line failure.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <LI>It is desirable to have microphone and speaker on the local unit to allow effective two-way communication between the caller and the control centre. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <LI>The unit should warm the user and if possible the control centre of power and telephone line failure. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <LI>The remote trigger should be easy to press and water proof so that the user can wear it even when bathing. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <LI>As the remote trigger generates radio wave, some experts do not exclude the possibility that radio wave generated by the remote trigger may interfere the operation of pace maker.  For consumers implanted with a pace maker, they are advised not to use remote trigger until it has been proven safe to use. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <LI>Consumers should check with service providers that their products comply with the Telecommunication Ordinance.  In the survey, all service providers claimed that their products fall within the Telecommunication (Low Power Devices) (Exemption from Licensing) Order.<BR>
</UL>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service providers, on the other hand, should provide the following:

<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <LI>A reliable service, e.g. man the hotline as claimed. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <LI>Active regular preventive maintenance service to ensure the local unit in good condition. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <LI>Adequately trained operators to communicate effectively with the user and provide adequate assistance. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <LI>In case of power or equipment failure, the control centre should be able to resume service within a reasonable period of time with the installation of back up battery or power supply.<BR>
</UL>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the report noted that some service providers offer one-off payment or a monthly charge.  At such early stage of service development,  consumers are advised to choose monthly charges to ascertain the quality of the service provider and to avoid loss due to sudden closure of the company.  Also, new products/service may emerge as the market becomes more mature in the future.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Consumer Council has also recommended the government and the social services sector to consider ways and means to ensure reliability of service i.e. whether it would be desirable to introduce legislation or licensing, over the operation of these service providers.  This is because of the high and irrevocable price a user may have to pay for an unreliable service - it may also cost live.

<P>
<CENTER>******************************</CENTER>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you enjoy cup noodles with a cup of tea, take a closer look at the containers in which your gastronomic delight is served.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recent reports from overseas have raised alarm of the potential health hazard the material of the container for cup noodles and Zisha cups with bluish-white cracked glaze may pose.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 59 samples of expanded polystyrene (EPS) food container comprising 48 cup noodles, 2 instant rice porridges, 7 foam bowls, cups and plates and 2 take-away containers were tested to investigate their safety for the presence of the toxic substance, residual styrene monomer (SM).  A separate test was also conducted to study the release of container constituents under different user conditions.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The results showed that the amount of SM in these food containers complied with the prescribed limit of the total residual styrene monomer as stipulated in the US Food and Drug Administration requirement.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The highest value detected in these food container samples was 0.08 percent - significantly less than the prescribed limit of 0.5 percent.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, the Council cautioned consumers to avoid using EPS containers to store food at a high temperature and for a long period of time.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is because the constituents of the EPS container could get into your food.  Such constituents may consist of styrene monomer and other additives harmful to health.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the study on the release of container constituents, it was showed that when oily food was held in EPS containers at a temperature of 100C for 24 hours, an amount of 728 mg/dm2 of the container constituents was transferred to the food.  The amount is some 72 times higher than the prescribed limit of 10 mg/dm2 as stipulated in the EEC Commission Directive (90/128/EEC).

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, EPS wastes, like other plastic materials, give rise to environment problems.  The amount of EPS container waste was on a drastic increase from 23 tonnes per day in 1993 to 62 tonnes in 1994.  For a better environment, consumers should make an effort to reduce the use of EPS containers. 

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Included in the other test were 13 models of Zisha cups comprising 7 with bluish-white cracked glaze, 3 with white glaze and 3 of the ordinary Zisha cups.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The test affirmed that 3 out of the 7 models with bluish-white cracked glaze had leachable lead content in excess of the prescribed ISO limit of 5 ppm.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The highest leachable lead content in these 3 models in question was detected to be 10.6 ppm.  Two of them bore marking on the bottom of the cup indicating that they are from a province in China.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other models were all within the safety limit.
	
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As it is difficult to recognise from appearance if a bluish-white cracked glaze Zisha cup may have high lead content, consumers are advised to avoid such cups until they are able to verify the safety of the product.

<P>
<CENTER>******************************</CENTER>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other highlights in this December issue of 'CHOICE':-

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Calling Number Display (CND)</B>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Telephone network operators are launching CND service which will available subscribers to identify incoming calls before answering.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But don't rush out to buy CND equipment.  This is because at this early stage, the product choice is fairly limited.  Also, not all telephone units with a LCD display is compatible with CND.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consumers need to be very careful.  They should insist on a demonstration in the shop to ensure the required function really work.  They are also not restricted to buy from their network operator and may choose from any retail sources in the market

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Personal Computer  -  CPU</B>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CPU is the heart of a computer.  It can severely affect the whole speed performance of the computer.  The right choice is therefore crucial.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Available in the market are several brands each with various models.  Consumers are advised to understand the basic specifications before making any purchasing decision.  They can consult the report in this issue of 'CHOICE'.

<H3>Consumer Council's Response to Recommended Rate for Motor Insurance</H3>
</CENTER>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recommended rate of increase for motor insurance premiums clearly demonstrates the need for adopting the proposals in the Consumer Council report on competition.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hong Kong Federation of Insurers has announced a 50 percent increase in third party motor insurance for private vehicles.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the broader perspective, recommended rates, even when they are not mandatory, are looked on as restrictions on competition," a Consumer Council spokesman said today.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They discourage companies from competing on price and this leads to prices being higher than would otherwise be the case."

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In its report, "Competition Policy: The Key to Hong Kong's Future Economic Success", the Council has proposed the introduction of a competition law that would prohibit recommendations on price unless an independent Competition Authority had exempted the practice, because it offered benefits to the public that outweighed the effect on competition.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The existence of recommendations such as those made by the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers demonstrates the need for the Council's proposals to be adopted," the spokesman said.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There may be good reasons why, in the case of motor insurance, there should be recommended rates, but these reasons should be explained to an independent Competition Authority, which could decide whether an exemption was justified," the spokesman added.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spokesman stressed that the Consumer Council is not making any judgement on the justification for the present recommended rate of price rise.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An independent Competition Authority, set up as proposed in the Council's competition report, will be able to address the public concern about such practices.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suppliers of Chinese dried seafood are urged to heed closely the quality of the food to safeguard the health of consumers.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And for those who favour Chinese dried seafood as a part of their regular diet, spare a thought for the potential hazard that it may pose due to contamination by heavy metals.  Consumers are encouraged to take a balanced diet.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This advice followed a Consumer Council test on the various types of dried seafood popular with Chinese especially during the cooler seasons.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The test analysed the dried seafood samples for their content of heavy metal contaminants such as chromium, cadmium, lead, tin, antimony, arsenic (as arsenic trioxide) and mercury which, in excessive quantity, can be harmful to health.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Varying traces of heavy metals were detected in the majority of samples.  Included in the samples were dried oyster, dried abalone, dried whelk and dried mussel.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But these is no cause for alarm as the levels of contaminants, according to the test, were mostly within the safety limit of the law.  The limit is stipulated in the Food Adulteration (Metallic contamination) Regulations.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two dried oyster samples were, however, found to contain cadmium in excess of the statutory safety limit.  But they are unlikely to lead to significant health risks as the food is not consumed regularly in large amount by the average population.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excessive intake of cadmium causes kidney damage, skeletal diseases particularly in people with malnutrition, and restriction of transfer of essential elements for brain development of the fetus in pregnant women.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For details of the <A HREF="T241_e.html">test findings</A>, consumers are advised to consult this November issue of 'CHOICE'.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to labelling the down content, some manufacturers of down quilts are less than totally accurate.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to a Consumer Council test, their actual down content, in many cases, was less than the label claim.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the 16 quilt samples tested, 14 indicated on the label their down content varying in quantity from 50% to 90%.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the test revealed a discrepancy of at least 10 percent less, by weight, in one half (7) of the samples.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most serious was detected in a sample which claimed 50% down content but was actually only 22% or a discrepancy of 28%.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other half of the samples fared better with differences of only a few percent.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the UK and US where there are labelling guidelines, they allow wide tolerances ranging from 15 to 30 percent variation in the labelling of down content of quilts.  In China and Australia, the tolerance in variation was only from 2 to 5 percent.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the down content is one of the crucial criteria in the selection of down quilts, consumers clearly need to be better informed.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manufacturers of down quilts are urged to exercise more self-discipline to ensure accuracy in the labelling of down content as there is, at present, no labelling guideline or standard in Hong Kong.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides actual down content, the test also examined down quilts for their thermal resistance, dry cleaning performance, weight and smell.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the test, all down quilts were rated "warm" in the warmth classification.  But the price does not necessarily bear correlation with its thermal resistance performance.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, down quilts were lighter than silk and mixed silk wadding quilts.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As winter is fast approaching, consumers contemplating the purchase of down quilts will find the report in this 241st issue of 'CHOICE' timely and useful.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may know all the tricks to perform magic on the computer - surf the cyberspace, send and receive e-mail and fax, play electronic games, watch video and produce all kinds of document.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But buying a new personal computer (PC) is as intimidating to the initiated as it is absolutely confusing to the novice.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consumers are confronted in the market with such a plethora of hardware standards of various types invariably couched in complex acronyms and jargons.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting this November issue of 'CHOICE', a series of comprehensive articles dealing with practical anything you need to know in setting up a home personal computer will be published to assist you in choosing and buying the right PC system.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The series offer independent and objective data and information different from those promoted by suppliers.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The report noted that there are different approaches in buying a PC.  Consumers can choose a whole set of branded PC system, or can order package made up of your own favourite pieces.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively, consumers can even choose the do-it-yourself way - buy separate parts and assemble the whole system by your own.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are both pros and cons for these different approaches.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consumers will find in the report many important points which need to be carefully considered, before deciding on the purchase of a personal computer.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consumers are also cautioned to be wary of the practices of some dishonest shops.  It is possible for the shops to use cheap and poor performance parts in the assembly if consumers do not specify the brand and model of the parts clearly.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consumers unfamiliar with computer hardware will do well to have someone knowledgeable to help in the whole buying and inspection process.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karaoke singing is great fun.  So don't let any accident ruin the occasion.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The potential hazard lies with the plastic bag that holds the laser disc.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plastic bags of this type are known to cause accident to young children who play with them as toys.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the US Consumer Products Safety Commission, between 1980 and 1987, 112 children died of suffocation after the plastic bags which they put over their head, blocked the nose and mouth and prevented breathing.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 80 percent of the victims were under the age of one year.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the next time when you do Karaoke at home or elsewhere and when there are babies and toddlers around, be sure to keep those plastic bags properly away from them.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Council has found that some of the laser disc plastic bags do not carry any warning of the potential suffocation hazard to young children.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is possible that the original plastic bags that come with the warning, were replaced after wear and tear by blank plastic bags that do not carry the same.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Council has urged video rental shops to use thicker plastic bags as the thinner the bags the more hazardous they are, and to ensure that they carry a warning statement in both Chinese and English.  Some video shops have already agreed to follow this advice.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms and conditions in use for locally-issued credit cards are lagging behind in consumer protection in comparison to the United States, Britain and Australia.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was borne out in a Consumer Council survey on the terms and conditions commonly found in the standard form agreements between card issuers and their customers.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often without a clear understanding of the implications of these provisions in the agreement, card holders have habitually signed for the acceptance of the cards and in so doing have agreed to be bound by these terms and conditions.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The survey followed a similar survey on credit card interest rates in April this year.  In this survey, covering 18 card issuers in Hong Kong, the Council focused on the terms and conditions governing the use of credit cards and compared these provisions with those in the United States, Britain and Australia.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The survey found, with only a few exceptions, the terms and conditions to be invariably loaded in favour of the card issuers.  In the event of a dispute over such matters as charges and payment, credit card users may find themselves at a disadvantageous position.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, legislative control over the operation of credit cards is through the Regulation Z - Truth in Lending (1989), in the UK, the Consumer Credit Act (1974) and in Australia, the Australian Capital Territory Credit Act (1985).  

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no similar law exists in Hong Kong for the protection of consumer interests, although there is now under consideration the introduction of a Code of Banking Practice.  The Code is being drafted by a working group of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Hong Kong Association of Banks and the Hong Kong Association of Restricted Licence Banks and Deposit-Taking Companies.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The survey showed that compared with countries such as the US, UK and Australia, there is clearly room for improvement in the interest of consumers in Hong Kong.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consumer Council, in the light of the findings of the survey, has put forward the following recommendations to the working group to bring Hong Kong more in line with these countries :

<P>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disclosure of credit information prior to application

<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>
Issuers should inform consumers, prior to application, of the annualized percentage rate, all charges and fees arising out of using the card, finance charge and balance computation method, and grace period.<BR>

<LI>
Such information should be displayed at a prominent location.<BR>
</UL>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Procedures in solving disputed items

<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>The period for complaints over disputed amount should not be limited to, say, only 14 days from statement date but that it should be extended to be in line with the 6-year period under the Limitation Ordinance in Hong Kong.<BR>

<LI>
Issuers should resolve the matter within 30 days (90 days, in case of overseas transactions).<BR>

<LI>
Cardholders can withhold disputed amount; collection action is prohibited until the dispute is resolved; and adverse credit reports are prohibited as is the case in other countries.<BR>
</UL>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liabilities of loss/theft before notifying card issuers

<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>Only when issuers can prove cardholders have acted fraudulently or have been grossly negligent, should cardholders be liable for all the losses before notifying the issuers of the loss/theft, otherwise the liabilities borne by cardholders should subject to an upper limit.<BR>

<LI>Issuers should provide, in advance, adequate notice of the maximum liabilities and means of reporting the loss/theft.<BR>
</UL>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offsetting balance provision

<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>Issuers should state clearly under what conditions could the debt owed in credit card account be offset by cardholders' deposit in other account(s).<BR>
</UL>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treatment of credit balance

<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>Issuers should return the balance within 7 business days.<BR>

<LI>
Issuers should not limit the period for request for refund to only a certain period, e.g. 3 months.<BR>
</UL>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change of terms and conditions

<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>Issuers should inform cardholders of any changes in terms and charges 30 days prior to the effective date of such changes.<BR>

<LI>
Cardholders who do not accept the new changes can cancel the card before the effective date of such changes and get a pro-rata refund of annual fee paid.<BR>
</UL>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renewal or cancellation

<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>Issuers should furnish all relevant information e.g. renewal fee, all charges and fees, and computation method to cardholders 30 days prior to end of validity period of card.<BR>

<LI>
In the case of automatic renewal, there should be a reasonable period during which the cardholders have the right to return the cards provided they have not been used in the meantime.<BR>
</UL>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others

<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>Cardholders' agreement should be written in plain language and printed in larger fonts.<BR>

<LI>Provisions concerning cardholders' liabilities and all types of charges should be printed in bold type.<BR>
</UL>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consumer Council is also concerned over the present practice by card issuers in relying on a general consent obtained well in advance from customers to enable wide-ranging unspecified disclosure of all information to a wide class of persons.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For card issuers to be in line with the "Personal (Data) Privacy Ordinance" and "Unconscionable Contracts Ordinance", the Council has suggested that they should :

<P>
<OL TYPE=1>
<LI>obtain an appropriate undertaking from a third party to treat information disclosed to it as confidential and not to freely disclose the same;<BR>

<LI>
require a third party to undertake further that it will only use the information for a limited purpose and confirm the issuer's accountability in writing to customers; <BR>

<LI>
only collection data for a lawful purpose directly related to a function or activity of the issuer which data should only be adequate but not excessive; and<BR>

<LI>
instead of relying on any all-encompassing general consent to any change of purpose, seek and obtain the customers' affirmative consent to each change of purpose, as and when the change is required, having given the customers a clear idea of what is proposed.<BR>
</OL>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Findings of the survey were published today in the 240th issue of the Council's monthly magazine 'CHOICE'.

<P>
<CENTER><B>         </B></CENTER>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The choice of a shampoo is seemingly unlimited with a baffling diversity of products to suit the individual needs and whims.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this October issue of 'CHOICE' is a comprehensive test report on a total of 140 models of shampoo comprising: "plain", "anti-dandruff", "2 in 1", "2 in 1 anti-dandruff", "children's/baby's" and "Chinese herbs" samples.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prices of the samples varied quite considerably with the anti-dandruff type being the most extensive at an average of $18.7 per 100 ml and the Chinese herbs the least costly at $9.2 per 100 ml.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Items investigated in the test include: pH, viscosity, foaming properties, contaminants (lead, arsenic, chromium, mercury) and selenium sulphide (much promoted as an effective anti-dandruff ingredient).

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The test found the samples to be, by and large, in compliance with their claims, safety limits and regulations.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, 6 samples labelled anti-dandruff which is a medicinal claim, were found without any registration number on their packages.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As preparation bearing this claim is considered a pharmaceutical product, it is subject to registration control under the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Consumer Council has referred these cases to the Department of Health for further action.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was also found that only a few of the anti-dandruff samples carried warning statements such as "avoid contact with the eyes" and "external use only" in Chinese.  Most do not have any warning while others have it in English only.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The report also offers information on a host of general public misconceptions and myths concerning the type of shampoo that will most suit one's needs and requirements.

<P>
<CENTER><B>         </B></CENTER>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The promise of beauty almost never fails to allure its victims.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least three consumers learned their lesson the hard way - after some $125,000 poorer and a lot of anguish.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this 240 issue of 'CHOICE' are highlighted their complaints against beauty salons.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Case No. 1</B>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The complainant went for facial massage and agreed on a sum of $100,000 for a total of 11 visits.  But only after one visit, she was shocked to find a few more wrinkles appearing around the eyes.  She also developed skin allurgy in the face.  She refused to continue with the treatment and demanded a refund which the beauty salon repeatedly turned down.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Case No. 2</B>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The complainant joined a slimming programme at $16,000 for a duration of one month.  The beauty salon staff promised it would take only 5 lessons to reduce 10 pounds and a few inches around the waist.  Or the whole amount would be fully refunded.  After half-way through the programme, the complainant was disappointed with the result.  She wanted to quit but was persuaded to complete the whole programme.  But still no visible slimming result afterwards.  She asked for the promised refund but was rejected on the ground that she had not strictly followed the diet of the beauty salon.


<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Case No. 3</B>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The complainant originally joined an 8-day "computer slimming" course at $800 but was persuaded to switch to lipo-suction treatment which cost $5,000.  While the complainant was undergoing the treatment, she was approached to buy bath lotion ($950), slimming lotion ($2,500) skin tightening lotion ($900).  she declined but was prevented from leaving the premises as the staff had hid the clothes from her.  Only after the complainant had agreed to the purchase was she returned her clothes to wear.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first eight months of this year, the Consumer Council has received a total of 30 complaints against beauty salons.  Most were related to unscrupulous sales practices such as described in the three complaints above.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consumer complaints against beauty salons are in fact on the decline from 134 cases in 1993, to 89 in 1994, and 74 in 1995.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A major difficulty in resolving these complaints is that some complainants were without any receipt for proof or that some receipts were written ambiguously.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consumers are advised to remember to always ask for a receipt that clearly lists out the scope of service, product items and refund provision.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consumers should also consult registered medical doctors for advice on the effectiveness of any treatment programme offered by beauty salons.  Do not be easily taken by beauty salon advertising.  The simple best slimming method remains: a controlled balanced diet and regular exercise.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laser and LED Printers<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If printing speed is your major consideration in the choice of a laser or LED printer, you are strongly urged to consult this test report on 8 different models of this product.  According to the report, some manufacturers are making rather optimistic claim on the printing speed as the actual performance is much lower for certain models.  Consumers are also advised to pay special attention to the running cost as it varies significantly for different models ranging from $4.2 to $35.2 per 100 pages (according to our calculation).<BR>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Consumer Council today welcomed the Government Response to its Report on Achieving Competition in the Liberalised Telecommunication Market.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is one area the Government has made much progress in opening the market and encouraging competition," said the chairperson of the Council's Steering Group on Telecommunications Policy, Dr. Sarah LIAO, noting that many of the Council's recommendations have already been implemented or are being implemented (for example U.S.O, reduction of barriers to competition, sharing of land space and facilities, exemption of GFA for telecommunications facilities).

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. LIAO, however, observed that the Government has only made "very broad statements" on some of the recommendations which it has accepted.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We would like to obtain more details on how these recommendations will be implemented and, most importantly, a definite time frame for their implementation," she added.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, on the anti-competition provisions in the proposed Telecommunication Ordinance, while the Government's intention is to take along the lines of the Council's recommendations in the bill to amend the Ordinance, "it has not proposed amendment to the level of penalty that will achieve the desired deterrent effect," said Dr. LIAO.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, on the Council's recommendation that OFTA provides comprehensive guidance on the preparation of customer charters, the Government has responded that the TA will consider issuing a guideline on what kind of basic information should be included in the customer charters and that the contents and format of the document should best be left to the service operators.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We welcomed the TA's intention to publish comparable service indicators but our concern is that there ought to be clear, specific information capable of assisting consumers to make the right comparison over the quality of service of the operators," she said.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has proposed an alternative way of dealing with the issue of non-discriminatory access to buildings.  Instead of the Council's recommendation for statutory requirement, the Government prefers the approach of the possibility of incorporating telecommunication access requirements into the codes of practice for architects and authorised persons.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Said Dr. LIAO : "Again we question when such discussions with the professional bodies will be concluded and details of enforcement of the codes.  In the event that such approach should fail, we maintain that the Government should move to legislate in this issue."

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the recommendation which the Government has not accepted, for the creation of a Secretary for Broadcasting, Telecommunications and Communications Technology (SBTC), the Consumer Council remains unconvinced of the Government's assessment on this matter.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Government's reluctance to accept the Council's recommendation for a statutory Advisory Board, Dr. LIAO said : "Despite there already exists a open consultation process for the TA, we firmly believe that such a statutory Advisory Board will further benefit consumers by strengthening the independent process of public consultation on key telecommunications issues."

<P>
Sandwiches may be a fast and efficient solution to the problem of lunch time rush for restaurants.  But the hygiene condition of some of the sandwiches sold at fast food outlets and bakeries in Hong Kong, is far from totally satisfactory.

<P>
This alert for potential public health hazard was raised in a test report of the Consumer Council, released today in its 'CHOICE' magazine, on the hygiene condition of 20 sandwich samples.

<P>
The samples, comprising both prepackaged and freshly made tuna fish, chicken and ham and egg sandwiches, were sourced from 11 different fast food restaurants and bakeries at busy locations.

<P>
According to the test, only 5 samples scored a straight grade A in all test items.  The test results were assessed against the "Microbiological Guideline for Sandwiches" adopted by Department of Health which divides the standard into four gradings : A (Satisfactory), B (Acceptable), C (Unsatisfactory), and D (Unacceptable / Potentially Hazardous).

<P>
The majority of the remainder samples received a mix of A and B grades indicating that their hygiene condition while not completely satisfactory was "Acceptable" in some test items.

<P>
4 samples, however, failed poorly with grades C and D indicating that their hygiene condition was below standard.

<P>
One sample was found to be "Unsatisfactory" in all test items relating to the level of Total Bacterial Count (TBC), E. Coli and Staphylococcus aureus.

<P>
(E. Coli is commonly found in feces; some strains of E. Coli are not harmful to health while some may cause diarrhoea and vomiting.  Staphylococcus aureus is due to human contamination of food through skin infections and symptoms include abdominal cramps, vomiting and diarrhoea.)

<P>
Another sample was judged to be "Unacceptable/Potentially Hazardous" in the E. Coli count with 110,000 per gram exceeding the "Acceptable" level of 100 by 1,100 times!  The same sample was also "Unsatisfactory" in its TBC test.

<P>
The remaining 2 samples were graded "Unsatisfactory" in the TBC and E. Coli tests respectively.

<P>
Contamination of the two pathogens, Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella, was not detected in all of the sandwich samples.

<P>
The Department of Health issued a new hygiene guideline on sandwiches last month while the Consumer Council was in the process of compiling the test findings.

<P>
The new guideline which the Council used to present the test results, is understood to facilitate the Department in its enforcement action.

<P>
The findings of the test indicated that there is still room for improvement in the hygiene condition of some sandwiches on public sale.

<P>
Unlike spoilage bacteria, food poisoning bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus does not alter the taste or appearance of the food.  Without laboratory testing, consumers are unable to detect if the food is contaminated with this specific pathogen.

<P>
Food manufacturers and handlers are requested to improve their quality control system, maintain strict personal hygiene practice, and minimize contact with food by wearing gloves and using tongs for fillings.

<P>
Consumers, on the other hand, are advised to purchase prepackaged sandwiches that are properly stored in temperature below 4 Jand labelled with "Use By Date".  

<P>
For made-to-order sandwiches, consumers are advised to observe the hygiene condition of the shop, i.e. proper food storage below 4J, whether raw and cooked food are kept apart, and whether food preparers used gloves or tongs when directly handling food.

<P>
In the same test, the Council also investigated 7 sushis - 6 prepackaged, 1 freshly made - on their hygiene condition.

<P>
The test results affirmed the recent findings on the analysis of sushi samples by the Department of Health.  More than half of the samples (5 out of 7) had problem with the Total Bacterial Count ranging from 130,000 to 13,000,000 per gram.

<P>
<CENTER><B>         </B></CENTER>

<P>
The controversy over hydrogen peroxide is back in the limelight.

<P>
This time it's with the product tooth whitener that claims to whiten your teeth by a chemical bleaching method.

<P>
A Consumer Council test has detected the presence of hydrogen peroxide as an active ingredient in these products.  Included in the test were samples drawn from the toothpaste type, the soak-and-bleach type and the spread-and-bleach type.

<P>
Concentration of 2.6% to 10.4% of hydrogen peroxide was found in all of the 7 test samples.

<P>
These levels are grossly in excess of the 0.1% limit under the EEC Directives relating to cosmetic products, by 26 to 104 times.

<P>
Excessive hydrogen peroxide in oral hygiene products may pose potential health risks to the users.

<P>
The chemical may cause transient sensitivity of teeth temporarily (less than 48 hours) due to irritation of pulpal enzymes.  It may also cause inflammation, swelling and bleeding of the gum.

<P>
Accidental ingestion of excessive hydrogen peroxide may result in a sudden generation of large amount of oxygen gas, causing the stomach to expand rapidly that may induce symptoms of nausea, vomiting and internal bleeding.

<P>
The Hong Kong Dental Association has advised against the use of over-the-counter tooth whiteners as the potential hazards from misuse outweigh their benefits.

<P>
Consumers are advised to use such products under strict professional guidance.  They should be prescribed by dentists who are knowledgeable about their proper use and capable of handling any complications that may arise.

<P>
In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is now further evaluating the status of tooth whiteners to determine if they should be regulated as "new drugs" or as cosmetics.  As "new drugs", they must possess adequate scientific data, including clinical trials, to establish that the product is safe and effective for its intended use.

<P>
The Council's test report also revealed that the trays enclosed with the soak-and-bleach type tooth whiteners are often ill-fitting.  Prolonged wearing of such trays may result in an increased unnecessary leakage of the bleaching agent into the oral cavity as well as hinge joint disorder.
	
<P>
The report noted that tooth whiteners may be useful in the removal of extrinsic staining such as those from tea and coffee but they may not respond to intrinsic staining such as fluorosis and dental caries.

<P>

<P>
A Consumer Council price survey on primary and secondary school textbooks this year has recorded an average increase rate of 12.11% and 11.30% respectively.

<P>
This compared with this year's annual inflation rate of 6.9%.

<P>
The annual price survey was based on data from 25 primary and 48 secondary schools in Hong Kong.

<P>
Despite the price increase, the overall expenditure for primary school textbooks dropped by 0.23%.  This is due to the amalgamation of 3 subjects (Social Studies, Science and Health Education) into 1 subject (General Studies).

<P>
But the overall expenditure for secondary school textbooks was up by 12.55% compared with last year.

<P>
As textbooks were chosen by teachers/schools rather than by parents/students, it is important that to reduce the burden of the latter, certain steps should be taken in the choice of textbooks :

<UL TYPE=DISC>

<P>
Use sandwich-base stainless steel cookware with caution.  Do not heat the pot when empty.

<P>
The aluminium inside the two layers of stainless steel that surround it, can melt and cause severe burns.

<P>
The aluminium is used as the metal conducts heat faster and more uniformly than normal stainless steel cookware.

<P>
This warning was issued in the wake of a complaint to the Consumer Council.  The complainant accidentally overheated the sandwich-base stainless steel cookware when empty.

<P>
This caused the aluminium in the base to melt.  The cookware was swiftly removed from the electric stove as soon as the complainant saw the accident.

<P>
The molten aluminium had, however, dripped down and burned her foot.  A big hole was also burnt in her slipper.

<P>
Although there was a warning of "Do not heat when empty" in the instruction leaflet, such warning failed to give the reason for not heating the cookware when empty and also to advise the consumers the procedures to follow when such accident happens.

<P>
The Council has suggested the manufacturer to enhance the warning with the following:  "Do not heat when empty as the aluminium can melt and cause severe burns.  If the cookware 'boils dry' and melts, turn off the heat; do not pick up the cookware until it cools".

<P>
Sandwich-base cookware is not to be confused with five layers stainless steel cookware which does not have the problem of dripping down hot molten aluminium as the whole cookware is made up of five layers, not just the base.

<P>
The safety of lipstick, probably the most popular cosmetic product on the
market, has come under the scrutiny of the Consumer Council again.

<P>
A Consumer Council <A HREF="LIP238.HTM">test</A> has detected possible
cancer-causing colour additives, namely, Rhodamine B and Permanent Orange,
in 10 brands of lipstick. 

<P>
Both substances were known to cause cancer in rats and mice in laboratory
experiment, and were prohibited from use in cosmetic products in the United
States and countries in the European Community.

<P>
The alert for potentially hazardous lipsticks was first raised by the
Consumer Council in a similar test in 1993 when 5 out of 29 lipstick samples
were found to contain Rhodamine B.  The lipsticks in question have since
ceased to be on sale on the market.

<P>
In view of the health hazard, since some amount of lipstick will almost
inevitably be swallowed during eating and drinking, the Consumer Council has
been concerned with the safety of this product.

<P>
Results of the latest test conducted by the Government Laboratory has
indicated that 10 out of 43 brands were still unsatisfactory: 4 contained
Rhodamine B, 3 Permanent Orange and the remainders both substances.

<P>
The Council has, at the first instance, notified the Customs and Excise
Department's Trading Standards Investigation Bureau as the presence of
potential carcinogenic substances in lipsticks may constitute an offence
under the Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance which came into force in October
last year.

<P>
The recent test has focused on lipsticks that fell within a price bracket of
$10 to $70 as all problem lipsticks detected in the previous test were
priced from $10 to $35 and available only at hawker outlets.

<P>
And as with the last test, all but one of the 10 problem lipsticks were
without proper country-of-origin labelling.  They were either simply without
any indication or labelled with fancy tags such as "Material in France",
"Beauty Series Paris", "Admired in Paris" and "Admired in U.S.A".

<P>
Further, there was no information provided on the net weight and ingredients
nor the provision of a packaging box for the product.

<P>
Consumers and in particular the lip fashion conscious are advised to look
out for these tell-tale signs of substandard lipsticks before making their
purchase.  They can consult the test report published in this August issue
of the Council's monthly magazine 'CHOICE'.

<P>
In addition to colour additives, the test also investigated the presence of
heavy metals (arsenic, chromium, lead and mercury) and carcinogens
(4-Aminoazobenzene, 4-Aminobiphenyl, Benzidine, Aniline, p-Toluidine and
Azobenzene).  None of these harmful substances was detected in the samples.

<P>
The test showed that 4 of the lipsticks could not retract fully into their
case.  Users might squash them when putting their caps back on, or stain the
caps and in turn stain the users' hand and clothing.

<P>
<CENTER><B>         </B></CENTER>

<P>
Some frosty mugs are not only prone to cracking and leakage, the liquid
coolant inside the frosty mugs may contain some poisonous chemicals.

<P>
The Consumer Council reported last month that 5 of the 7 frosty mug samples
tested failed in the impact resistance test, giving rise to the concern over
the safety of the coolant contained between the layers of the plastic frosty
mugs.

<P>
A follow-up test was carried out and the findings were startling: present in
the coolant of 4 of the samples were found methanol and ethylene glycol.
Both substances are poisonous to humans if ingested.

<P>
The test showed that 3 of the frosty mugs with methanol were also samples
that failed in the impact resistance test.  It is possible that accidental
ingestion of the coolant could result due to leakage.

<P>
It was found that 2.50 to 4.51mL of methanol was present in 3 samples
although the lethal dosage is set at 25 to 100mL but even as little as 10mL
of methanol may cause blindness.  11.5mL of ethylene glycol was found in one
sample and the lethal dosage is 60 to 100mL.

<P>
The report noted that none of these frosty mugs was labelled with the
chemical composition of the coolant - and the direction for handling
accidental ingestion.

<P>
Instead they all carried labels suggesting that their coolant is non-toxic
and some even stated that the product is safe for children.

<P>
Consumers are advised to check their frosty mug regularly.  If there is any
sign of cracking, the frosty mug should be discarded immediately.  And if in
doubt, stop using it.

<P>
Is yoghurt a tasty snack, a tantalising dessert or a 'health food'?

<P>
Whatever it is, it has come clean of a recent Consumer Council test to
investigate the hygiene condition of this product.

<P>
No coliform was detected in the vast majority (89 percent) of the samples
analysed.  Coliform count is a hygiene indicator for yoghurt products.

<P>
All samples - a total of 44 that included yoghurt, yoghurt drinks and frozen
yoghurt - were able to comply with the coliform standard in the Frozen
Confections By-Laws.

<P>
On the other hand, many a dramatic health and nutritional claim has been
made for yoghurt.  But how accurate is such claim?

<P>
Yoghurt generally contains less than half the calorie and less than 4 times
fat than ice cream.  It also contains less sugar.

<P>
Of the 44 yoghurt products analysed, 20 have claimed to be either 'Low Fat',
'Reduced Fat' or 'Low Calorie'.

<P>
The test revealed that only 14 of these 20 samples were true to their claims
according to the US Nutrition Labelling and Education Act (NLEA).  The
claims of the other 6 samples - all frozen yoghurt - could not be substantiated.

<P>
One exceeded twice the NLEA standard in low calorie.  The 4 others which
made the claims in their promotional brochures and not on their product
labelling, were also in excess of the NLEA standard in low fat and low calorie.

<P>
Of these samples, 3 exceeded slightly the low fat standard and twice the low
calorie standard, and had a high sugar content of 17 to 20 percent
comparable to that of ice cream. One sample, a frozen yoghurt bar with
chocolate coating, has even higher fat and calorie contents closely matching
those of chocolate ice cream bar.

<P>
According to the Food and Drugs (Composition and Labelling) (Amendment)
Regulations, 1996 which was gazetted in February this year, pre-packaged
food products making special claim on a particular ingredient were required
to declare the percentage by weight or the actual amount of that particular
ingredient on the label.  This provision would come into operation on a
later date to be appointed by the Secretary of Health and Welfare.

<P>
Yoghurt enthusiasts are urged to consult the test report in this August
issue of 'CHOICE' for choice of a growing diversity of yoghurt products -
and the veracity of claims - on the market.

<P>
Users of progressive hair dyes beware!

<P>
A recent Consumer Council test has detected in some (4 out of 8) progressive
hair dyes excessive levels of lead, a toxic substance detrimental to health.

<P>
According to the US Food and Drugs Administration and the European
Community, the use of lead as acetate in hair dyes should not exceed the
permitted concentration of 0.6 percent.

<P>
Lead can accumulate in the human body and develop gradually its toxicity
effects that may include impairment of neurological system, haem synthesis, 
dysfunction of kidney, and increased blood pressure in adults.

<P>
Users are advised to wash their hands after use and keep the hair dyes away
from children.

<P>
The test also examined 4 temporary hair dyes.  They were given a clean bill
of health: all were free of heavy metals, banned colouring agents and skin
irritants.

<P>
Results of the test on semi-permanent hair dyes were published in the last
(July) issue of 'CHOICE'.

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skin irritants and potential carcinogenic substances were detected in samples of 23 hair dye products on sale in the market.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was revealed today by the Consumer Council in a test report published in the latest (237th) issue of its monthly magazine 'CHOICE'.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the first time the Council has reported potential cancer-causing substances in hair dyes.  In the two previous tests, in 1992 and 1987, the Council found only skin irritants.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential carcinogenic substances were found in the colouring agents of two semi-permanent hair dyes.  The agents in question were: methyl violet and rhodamine B.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both these substances, according to the European Community Cosmetic Directives, were not allowed to be used in cosmetics.  They were also not permitted by the US Food and Drugs Administration.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hong Kong, methyl violet was once used as a food colour additive but had been deleted for use since 1993.  Toxicological data showed that it developed demonstrable carcinogenicity in mice.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhodamine B was an experimental carcinogen in rats via subcutaneous route and it was observed to cause local sarcomas (tumour).
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the presence of potential cancer-causing substances in hair dyes may constitute an offence under the Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance, the Council has notified, at the first instance, the Customs and Excise Department's Trading Standards Investigation Bureau for enforcement action.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bureau has since made seizures of the products in question and served a Prohibition Notice on an importer and a manufacturer to cease further supplying these products.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The test found skin irritants in most (13 out of 15) of the permanent and 2 of the 8 semi-permanent hair dye samples.	 The irritants were identified to be para-phenylenediamine (p-PDA) and meta-phenylenediamine (m-PDA).
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Users may develop allergic reactions such as inflammation, itchiness or even exfoliate dermatitis.  Consumers should therefore follow the advice to conduct a patch test on their skin before use.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance and Regulations, hair dye preparations containing phenylenediamines need to be labelled with their names and proportions as well as a warning statement in both English and Chinese.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most (15 out of 23) failed to fully comply with this requirement and the Council has already notified the Health Department of this finding.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motorists of cars fitted with passenger-side airbags beware!
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driving parents are warned today never to place infants in rear-facing child safety seats in the front seat if the vehicle has a passenger-side airbag.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warning followed reports in the US of fatalities involving at least 19 children after passenger-side airbags were deployed.  Among them, 5 infants were killed in rear-facing child seats placed in the front seat fitted with a passenger-side airbag.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the passenger-side airbag, the rear-facing infant carrier is the safest type of restraint for babies.  The baby is carried partially reclined, thus spreading crash forces in a frontal impact over the whole of the back.  There is no pressure on the abdomen, and the head and neck are also supported.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many driving parents prefer to place the infant in such safety restraint in the front vehicle seat so that they could easily monitor and take care of the baby.	 But with the advent of the passenger-side airbag, a new hazard has emerged simply because airbags do not work with rear-facing infant seats.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The European Automobile Manufacturers Association has designed a warning label that has already been fitted voluntarily by some manufacturers.  However, the design was found to be confusing and misleading.  A working group of the International Organization for Standardization and consumer associations in Europe have recommended another warning label that uses a combined pictogram and text to clearly explain the hazard.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hong Kong, the Transport Department noted that the use of rear-facing child seats and passenger-side front airbags is not widespread here.  However, if the European Commission has agreed on a warning label, the department would suggest a bilingual warning label for car agents to fit it voluntarily to airbag equipped cars.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advice for driving parents: the safest place for children of all ages is the back seat.  Never place rear-facing infant restraint in vehicle seat with airbag.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It pays to shop around before you put your money in a savings or fixed deposit account with a bank, particularly if large sums of money is involved.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a Consumer Council survey, banks varied , in a leap year (1996 being one), in the basis on which they calculate interest payments.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that consumers may earn interests more or less depending on where you bank your money.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The survey revealed that in a leap year, some banks adopt 366 days as the basis for interest calculation.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formula applied for calculating interest is: interest = deposit amount x annual interest rate / calculation basis (365 or 366 days) x number of days of deposit.  So, the bigger the basis (366 days) the less interest you will earn for your savings or deposit.  Conversely, the smaller the basis (365 days) the more interest you will pay for your loan.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the inter-bank market, banks invariably follow the international money market practice in adopting the 365 days (for Hong Kong currency) and 360 (for US currency) as the basis for calculation.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choosing a bank that adopts 365 (for local currency) and 360 (for US currency) as the basis for interest calculation will therefore be to the advantage of the depositors.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the interest rate for savings is stipulated by the Hong Kong Association of Banks, this does not mean that all banks will pay the same amount of interest.	 Much will depend also on the compound factor that will make a difference to the effective annual interest rate.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depositors receiving daily compound for their deposits will actually earn an effective annual interest rate of 3.821% instead of the stipulated 3.75%.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The survey also looked at bank charges, if any, related to the withdrawal of fixed deposits.	 It was found that some banks would insist on charging a fee for withdrawing fixed deposit with a cashier order even though the payee is the depositor himself.  
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This practice brought into question the right of a depositor to receive the amount of his deposit in full and the obligation of a bank to pay to the depositor his money in full in a secure and efficient way.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, it was found that some banks may recommend customers to open a current account so as to withdraw the deposit by cheque. This arrangement is again against the interest of both banks and customers.  
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, it incurs administrative expenses (an average annual costs of $1,500 per account at 1992 estimate) for banks in managing the growing volume of accounts by same clients - a concern of the banking sector when the issue of interest rate deregulation was raised.  
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other, consumers may have to pay additional charges if the account carries a minimum deposit requirement which they may fail to observe.
<p>
<CENTER>         </CENTER><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A frosty mug is an innovation designed to keep your drink nice and cool.  But a Consumer Council test has raised concern about the safety of this product which is a double layer plastic mug with sealing coolant between the layers.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The test, conducted with reference to the British Standard, showed that 5 samples cracked and leaked after 3 consecutive drops in the impact resistance test putting the durability of these products in serious doubt.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what exactly is the substance of the coolant which may accidentally get into the drink through leakage?  Does it pose any health hazard?
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The test found the coolant to be free of coliform and total bacterial count.  Nevertheless the British Standard requires that all additives to the coolants should be permitted food additives only and identified by name, code number or common alternative name.  All samples were found to be without proper labelling as such.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An agent of 4 of the test samples has disclosed that the coolant of their products contains 0.3% ethanol and food additives. Another agent has suggested that their coolant is not suitable for consumption.  The Consumer Council is now carrying further test to investigate the composition of the coolant.  For the moment, the Council does not preclude the possibility the coolant may consist of chemicals not suitable for human consumption.   
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumers should prevent ingestion of the coolant and are therefore advised to regularly check their frosty mug.  And should there be any crack found in the mug, it should be discarded immediately.
<p>
<CENTER>         </CENTER><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breastmilk is the best infant food available.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But mothers who are unable to breastfeed their children and have to rely on infant formulas, may have a sigh of relief - at least as far as the level of heavy metal contamination in infant formulas is concerned.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy metals such as lead and aluminium in infant formula have always been a concern for breastfeeding organisations and mothers.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a Consumer Council test, none of the 20 infant formula samples was found to exceed the lead and aluminium standards set by the World Health Organisation and existing regulations in Hong Kong.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The test samples included cow milk infant formulas, soy protein based infant formulas and follow-up formulas.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, of the 6 soy protein samples, 4 were found to have a higher level of lead and aluminium than cow milk samples.  This may be due to the fact that cow can partially excrete heavy metal absorbed whereas soy bean has an added source of contamination during the crushing, refining and washing processes.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just a reminder.  The 1996 World Breastfeeding Week is celebrated between 1 and 7 August.  This year's theme is Breastfeeding: A Community Responsibility.

<LI> Housing is critically important to Hong Kong people as shelter and as a favourite form of investment.  The sale of land for housing is a significant source of Government revenue.  About 45% of all households now own the property they live in, <B><A HREF=#FN1>  1 </A></B> and many more wish to do so. Those who are homeowners seek to find other homes where space is less limited and which are of better quality. 

<P>
<LI> Since the trough in the early 1980s, residential prices have generally grown faster than income.  From 1985 to 1995, property prices increased faster than inflation (consumer price index A) in 10 out of the eleven years, with an average real price increase of 11% a year (<A HREF="ANNEX/A1.HTM"> Annex 1 </A> ). <B><A HREF=#FN2>  2 </A></B>  Although property prices have slackened since June 1994, the average price has not dropped below 1993 levels.  After 18 months of decline, prices in the first quarter of 1996 have started to rise.  In 1995, the affordability ratio  <B><A HREF=#FN3>  3 </A></B>   represented 73% of average household income (<A HREF="ANNEX/A2.HTM"> Annex 2 </A>), far exceeding the 40-50% of monthly repayment of mortgage loan to household income considered by banks to be the maximum affordable.  The affordability ratio in the first quarter of 1996 has slightly improved but is still high at 64%.  The efficiency of the private residential market has therefore become a particular focus of consumer interest.

<LI>This is a study of the private residential property market.  It seeks to :
 <OL TYPE=(1) START=1>
 <LI> assess the degree of competition in the private residential property market;
 <LI> examine restrictive practices, if any, in the market which may affect the consumer; and

<FONT SIZE=+1><B> Methodology</B></FONT>

<OL TYPE=1 START=4>
<P>
<LI> This report is based on the analysis of a Consultancy Team of the Department of Building and Real Estate, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HKPU) and the Consumer Council's own investigations.

<P>
<LI> The HKPU and the Council held discussions with Government branches and departments, individual developers, the Real Estate Developers Association (REDA), public bodies, banks and securities houses, lawyers, estate surveyors, property agents, various professional and interest groups.  A total of 64 organizations were interviewed.

<P>
<LI> Data used in this study was supplied by individuals, companies and Government departments.  The Council has made every effort to ensure data accuracy. In some areas we have been able to use multiple data sources to cross-check the validity of the data we obtained. The relevant data source and methodology employed are provided in footnotes to the chapters.  Constraints in data collection sometimes imposed limitations on the time span adopted for the study. <B><A HREF=#FN4>  4 </A></B>.

<P>
<LI> Where possible, the study uses data from 1980 to 1995. This covers both the ups and downs of the property market and contains, as well as long stretches of favourable economic conditions, a number of economic and political shocks (see footnote <B><A HREF=#FN2>  2 </A></B>).  Due to limited resources and availability of data, our studies of market share and case studies on market behaviour concentrated on recent years, that is from 1991 to 1994 and from 1990 to mid-1995 respectively.  Data up to mid-1996 is also included to provide a more comprehensive and up-to-date analysis of market conditions.

<FONT SIZE=+1><B> Market Structure </B></FONT>

<P>
<OL TYPE=1 START=8>
<LI> The private housing market consists of new and second-hand property.  The latter is a much bigger market with a larger trading volume, accounting for 60-70% of the annual property sales volume between 1985 and 1994. <B><A HREF=#FN5>  5  </A></B>  However, the fact that most owners of second hand property only own the one unit they occupy means that the influence of individual owners selling property is much smaller than the influence which developers owning whole blocks of units can exercise in the market. 

<P>
<LI> The market for new private residential property is not necessarily the product of free and competitive market forces.  There are two crucial factors affecting the current market structure:
	<OL TYPE=1 START=1>
	<LI> the role of Government as monopoly provider of new land, and regulator of building development; and 
	<LI> the high market concentration of developers of private housing.
	</OL>
</OL>

<P>
<BR><BR>
<B> Role of government </B>

<P>
<OL TYPE=1 START=10>
<LI> Land is a scarce resource.  Government controls the supply of new land and controls the planning, building and, in some cases, sale of buildings.  The Government's philosophy is 'to provide sufficient land, supporting infrastructure and a financial environment which induces private sector investment in property development.' <B><A HREF=#FN6>  6  </A></B>   It also seeks to provide a healthy living environment and ensure building safety, and to discourage excessive speculation.  Income from land disposals accounted for about 11% of total Government revenue in 1994/95. 

<P>
<LI> Government provides accommodation for over half of Hong Kong's population through the Housing Authority and Housing Society.  Public housing on such a scale also has an impact on the private sector property market.

<B> Market concentration </B>

<P>
<OL TYPE=1 START=12>
<LI> In the market for new residential property, private developers play an important role in supplying housing stock from new land and redeveloped land.  The study found a high degree of market concentration among developers from 1991-94 <B><A HREF=#FN7>  7  </A></B> (<A HREF="ANNEX/A3_E.HTM">Annex 3</A> ) :
	<OL TYPE=1 START=1>
	<LI>70% of total new private housing was supplied by seven developers.
	<LI>55% came from just four developers.
	<LI> One developer consistently supplied 25% of new housing units.
	</OL>

<P>
<LI> This degree of market concentration, is not necessarily bad or anti-competitive.  To some extent it will reflect the efficiencies resulting from economies of scale, and successful business strategies and confidence in the market even in market downturns.

<P>
<LI> The study therefore looked at the market structure to see how far it was 'contestable'.  In a fully contestable market all the participants act in a fiercely competitive manner resulting in maximum efficiency with prices close to costs.  If the market is not contestable, i.e. there is no threat of new entrants to the market, and there is high market concentration, then there is also a risk of abuse of market power.   For example, producers would have increased opportunity to charge higher prices and engage in anti-competitive behaviour.  No market is fully contestable.  The study examined how far the market was contestable and how contestable it is likely to be in future.

<P>
<OL TYPE=1 START=15>

<B> Market entry and exit</B>

<P>
<OL TYPE=1 START=16>
<LI> Free entry, in this definition, means that a new firm need not incur any costs that are not also incurred by a firm already producing in the industry.   We also looked at whether new entrants face any other comparative disadvantages.

<P>
<LI> There was and is no legal barrier to entry in Hong Kong.  But, potential new entrants have the following disadvantages compared to existing firms :

	<P>
	<OL TYPE=1 START=1>
	<LI> higher land costs:  The price of land in Hong Kong is high by global standards. In the period 1993-95, individual land lots at sites with good residential development potential sold for $2-5 billion each (<A HREF="ANNEX/A4_E.HTM">Annex 4 </A>).   <B><A HREF=#FN9>  9  </A></B>   However, land exchange entitlements and land banks acquired pre-1985 when land was less expensive gave incumbents a 'cheap' source of land supply.  In theory, this enabled them to put in high bids for new land auctioned by the Government and yet have an average cost of land that was still much lower than new entrants'.  The difference in average land costs was a severe barrier for new entrants.  By bidding high, developers with landbanks could potentially forestall new entry to the market and at the same time increase the asset value of their existing portfolio ;
	<P>
	<LI>higher financing costs: Developers with established track records would have access to low interest bank loans and other financial instruments.  New entrants which have no established track records would not be able to secure finance as easily or at comparable rates :
	<P>
	<LI> weaker bargaining power:  Large developers enjoyed economies of scale and greater bargaining power in hiring professionals and contractors ; and 
	<P>
	<LI> limited and variable access to land resources:  New entrants were largely dependent on the amount of Government land released each year, and suffered from tendering procedures which were restricted to holders of Letters A and B <B><A HREF=#FN1> 10 </A></B>  at some sites.  Land banks also enabled major developers to maintain smooth production levels regardless of Government supply levels (<A HREF="ANNEX/A5_E.HTM"> Annex 5 </A>).
	</OL>

<P>
<LI> It has been suggested that small developers can form consortia to compete with large developers.  Although consortia can in theory help small developers, in practice small developers were much less attractive to potential partners and they usually found it difficult to compete with the bidding consortia formed by large developers.

<P>
<LI> Foreign developers generally only participate at the periphery of any local residential property market, in part because they lack knowledge of the market and a local vertical network of financial backers and contractor teams.  Overseas companies may also have been deterred by experiences in their own country's property markets,  different risk assessment methods and by concerns about the territory's future.

<P>
<LI> The main concern with regard to ease of exit is recovery of the huge land acquisition costs. Whether it is possible to achieve a costless exit after having met the basic obligations is entirely a function of the market at the time.
</OL>

<P>
<BR><BR>
<B> Speed of entry</B>

<P>
<OL TYPE=1 START=21>
<LI> The turnaround time for land to be converted into housing units is about 3-4 years.  New firms therefore cannot enter and exit within a very short period of time.
</OL>

<P>
<BR><BR>
<B> Degree of contestability </B>

<P>
<OL TYPE=1 START=22>
<LI> It is obvious from the above that the market is not very contestable.  In the past 10 years, some major developers changed their business strategies and left the market.  Market downturn screened out some others.  Whilst new entrants have emerged, no new firms became major players (i.e. capable of producing 5% or more of the annual supply of new private housing) in the market after 1981. The greatest obstacle has been the hefty costs and limited availability of land.

<P>
<LI> Recently, the bid for one of the MTRC airport railway sites was won by a consortia including Singaporean interests and local partners.  This shows that a foreign company with a local partner did find it possible to enter the market.  It remains to be seen whether the market structure will be affected in any significant way.

<P>
<LI> The market structure since 1995 has not and, from the information available to the study, does not appear likely to alter in a way which will greatly improve contestability in the foreseeable future, with the exception of the end of  tendering restricted to holders of Letters A and B.  This was based on the need to honour historical commitments and will cease after June 1997.  Also, many of the big developers will have to commit huge funds for the development of sites above the new airport railway.  This may reduce their appetite for smaller sites and increase the opportunities for smaller developers to take part in development of non-airport railway sites in the next few years.

<P>
<LI> Otherwise, there is little change in the market fundamentals: residential land supply is still subject to great constraints; and developers still have land banks comprising a gross floor area of approximately 70-80 million sq.ft. (although these sites need approval to develop for residential use). Big developers still have easy access to capital - one developer is in the process of arranging a multi-billion loan facility which has been several times oversubscribed.
</OL>

<P>
<BR><BR>
<B>Competition from non-private sector developers</B>

<P>
<OL TYPE=1 START=26>
<LI> While there was little competitive pressure from potential new entrants, there was also little competitive pressure from other sectors of the primary housing market. Restrictions on those eligible for subsidized housing means substitutability only exists in one direction.  Government policies to encourage home ownership increased demand for sales flats in both the public and the private sector.  The private sector's share of the housing market has increased over time.
</OL>

<P>
<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B> Market Behaviour of Developers </B></FONT>

<P>
<OL TYPE=1 START=27>
<LI> The study examined whether any of the sales strategies, pricing policies or other aspects of developers' market behaviour had the effect of reducing competition in the market and affecting consumer interest.  Developers had complete freedom.  However, their choice of behaviour, i.e. which strategies made the best commercial sense, was very heavily influenced by the above market structure.  Developers operating in a market with an abundant supply of land, for example, would be unlikely to adopt the same commercial strategies as  developers operating in a market with a restricted land supply like Hong Kong's. To take another example, participants in a market with low barriers to entry like, say, mobile phones where there is a continual threat of a new manufacturer suddenly launching a cheaper or innovative product, would behave differently from participants in a market with high barriers to entry and long production time like the Hong Kong property market.

<P>
<LI> With regard to the market behaviour of major developers, we made the following observations in 3 case studies over the period 1990-95 for developments in Tseung Kwan O, Ma On Shan and Lam Tin (<A HREF="ANNEX/A6A_E.HTM">Annex 6A</A>):
	<OL TYPE=1 START=1>
	<LI>the sales of properties on competing sites alternated;
	<LI>flats were released in batches.
	</OL>

<P>
<LI> These supply techniques meant less choice for consumers, higher prices, reduced ability to make price comparisons and, in the booming market conditions prevailing at the time, to some extent, enabled developers to influence market atmosphere.  Developers contend that such techniques were in practice the result of heated competition among developers.  But this heated competition could be the result of interdependence under an oligopoly (market with a limited number of participants holding a dominant share).  If this were the case it would reflect imperfect market competition and not be in consumers' best interests.

<P>
<LI> In another three case studies (covering 1994 to 1996, i.e. including an 18 month period of declining market prices) of developments in Tai Po, Yuen Long and Shatin, flats in different developments were generally released for public  sale at different times, even though the products varied in terms of location, type of development and range of unit size (<A HREF="ANNEX/A6B_E.HTM">Annex 6B</A>).   Flats have also continued to be released in batches.  For developers, this is to test market reaction.  But the effect is regulating supply which is a form of price discrimination.  It would not be possible in a highly competitive market.  We do not know how often it occurred that public sales alternated, nor how it happened.

<P>
<LI> Since the market downturn in mid-1994, information available from Government indicated that major developers on occasion completed projects later than estimated completion dates. <B><A HREF=#FN11>  11  </A></B>   For example, production of 9 projects involving 10,400 units by 5 major developers due to be completed in 1996 has been rescheduled until the beginning of 1997, two projects have exceeded the completion dates as specified in the building covenant (<A HREF="ANNEX/A7_E.HTM">Annex 7</A> ). <B><A HREF=#FN12>  12  </A></B>  

<P>
<LI> <A NAME="PARA32"></A>Our study also found that long-term vacancy rates (the proportion of flats vacant 2 years after completion) <B><A HREF=#FN13>  13  </A></B> were significantly higher among flats owned by developers than vacancy rates in the market overall - 11% of 17,300 new units compared to 4% of 885,700 housing stock in 1995.  In some cases, this was a result of developers not being able to sell at the prices they were asking. Less accessible locations could also have affected sales in some new developments. Prices were sometimes below secondary market prices.  However, in other cases, when prices at certain sites were significantly lowered, units sold very quickly.  The high vacancy rates could be reduced if prices were lowered or purchasers entered the market instead of holding off,  expecting a fall in market prices.  High vacancy rates or downward price rigidity is unlikely in highly competitive markets.  Such a situation if lasting for a long period is against the interests of potential home purchasers.

<P>
<LI> As for availability of the units on the market, in the period January 1994 - May 1996, the Government issued consents for presale of 57 residential developments involving nearly 40,040 housing units.  Of these, only forty percent has been put onto the market (up to May 1996).  The remaining sixty percent have either not been put up for sale or been reserved for internal sale (the Consent Scheme restricts internal sales to 10% of units in each development).  This is unlikely in highly competitive markets where developers would want to sell units as soon as possible.

<P>
<LI> We also found that only 7% of the cases were put out for sale within a month of the granting of the consent. On average, the time gap was about 120 days and in five extreme cases, the time gap was over 540 days ( <A HREF="ANNEX/A8_E.HTM"> Annex 8 </A> ). 

<P>
<LI> Developers apparently adapt their business strategies to suit the market climate.  Developers competed fiercely with each other at times, for example in bidding for building lots, especially when the market was rising.  There were even occasions when developers entered into litigation with one another.   This might be taken to signify a highly competitive market but could also signify interdependence under an oligopoly.

<P>
<LI> Although the limiting and regulating of supply observed in the case studies and above paragraphs could result in less choice and higher prices for purchasers, they make perfect business sense and do not constitute any contravention of the law of Hong Kong.  Indeed, developers have complete freedom to decide when to sell and developers stressed that "when to sell or not is ... a matter of commercial discretion of the developers in the free market".  Developers say that they would sell their units as promptly as possible.  However, the observations show that this may not always be the case.  It was also said that developers decided their sales strategies bearing in mind the results of their sales exercises, its implications on their corporate performance and share prices, and current market circumstances.

<P>
<LI> The scarcity of land, heavy demand for new property aggravated by the segmentation of the first and second markets (discussed below), and high entry threshold explain why these market strategies would be the 'right', or most commercial strategies from the  point of view of the major developers.  However, they would have been difficult to sustain in a market where there was a real threat of new entrants or competitors filling the supply gap in between sales.  Developers were acting honestly and commercially in the given circumstances.  But the fundamental issue is the market structure which enables developers to exercise market power.

<P>
<OL TYPE=1 START=38>
<LI> While profits seemed to be highly uncertain in the early 1980s with a number of developers failing to survive market downturns, in the period 1985-95, developers made higher gains with all four major property developers studied performing much better than the overall stock market.  This was after substantial reinvestment in new land acquisition.  At project level, in the five case studies involving 13 residential developments, estimated profits were particularly high for developments on land acquired through Letters A and B (<A HREF="ANNEX/A9_E.HTM">Annex 9</A> ). <B><A HREF=#FN14>  14  </A></B>   They ranged from 77% to 364% of the total estimated development costs.  For lots obtained by public auction, the estimated profit margins ranged from 6% to 109%.

<P>
<LI> However,  HKPU's case studies also show that two other developers  which are not of comparable size to the large developers suffered losses ranging between 37% and 69% of costs at project level when the market fell (1980-84).  The means by which land was acquired, the market environment at the time of land acquisition and at the time of project completion were critical factors in determining the level of developers' returns.

<OL TYP=1 START=41>
<LI> New land supply was carefully controlled by Government for, among other things, fiscal interests, and, until 1997, by limits in the Sino-British Joint Declaration. New land mainly comes from reclamation and opening up new areas.  The pace at which new land can be supplied is subject to constraints such as transport, infrastructure capacity and environmental concerns.  After the Government Task Force report in 1994, the Government has taken progressive steps to co-ordinate efforts in producing more new land.  Other measures proposed include a land inventory system and a one-year land reserve in order to cater for unanticipated changes in external demand.  Implementation of the proposals are in progress and being closely followed up by relevant departments, though we have yet to see the results of the land inventory system.

<LI> Government land disposal figures for the period 1985/86 - 1996/97 show that Government residential land supply has varied from 40 to 80 hectares per year.

Although redeveloped land accounted for approximately 2/3 of new private housing since 1990, its full potential had not been realised with a considerable number of industrial buildings or sites lying empty in Kwun Tong and other areas.

<B> Housing supply </B>

<P>
<OL TYPE=1 START=45>
<LI> Continued high prices for private residential property compared to average income, and long waiting times and waiting lists for public housing, as well as household formation rates indicate significant unmet demand.  Private housing supply fell below Government published estimates in 12 out of the 16 years to the end of 1995.  The discrepancy between estimated and actual supply ranged from +9% to -35%.  These forecasts are based on developers production plans and the Rating and Valuation Department's estimates.  The lower than estimated private housing actual or forecast supply in 95, 96 and 97, imply a dramatic increase in private sector production supply in the years 1998 - 2001 if the Government's estimated increase in the supply of housing announced in the Long Term Housing Strategy is to be realised. There may be a bunching effect towards the second half of the period.

<P>
<LI> The supply available to potential home buyers could also have been affected by developers and speculators not releasing units onto the market. The Government's Task Force Report said that "about 18% of the units in large developments completed in 1992 were still vacant at the end of April 1994, i.e. over a year.  These are prima facie cases of hoarding."  This study found that at the end of 1995, 14% of new units (about 2,500 units) were vacant two years after completion (of which 11% were held by developers (<A HREF=#PARA32>paragraph 32</A> refers) and the rest by private individuals and others).

<P>
<LI> Market segregation reduced substitutability of units between these markets.  It  restricted purchasers' choice and led to greater demand in the primary market (new properties).  In rising markets, it has fuelled speculation in new property.  As a result prices spun to new heights, and prices for new units in urban areas acted as a benchmark for older units.  Although prices for first- and second-hand units were interdependent, because of the dispersed ownership of the latter, and preference for new developments, developers were able to exert a strong influence despite their small market share.

<P>

<LI> The study found that the market in new residential property in Hong Kong is not highly competitive and not very contestable.  It identifies some barriers to competition, in particular the shortage and high cost of land and comparative advantage of those with existing land banks.  However, the Council found that there was no suggestion of collusion amongst developers, and recognises that whatever developers do are commercial responses to the prevailing market structure and that any measure of the success and profitability of developers should also take into account the risks involved.  Nonetheless, it is questionable whether the best interests of consumers have been served under the prevailing market structure in Hong Kong.

<LI> Although the problem lies with the market structure, the Consumer Council believes that it would not be appropriate for Government to take drastic action to "correct" the situation by breaking up the dominant participants as in the case of the US Government breaking up its communication giants, AT&T and US Steel.  In our case, breaking up individual firms would not be effective in dealing with the market competition issues because it would only have a limited effect on the underlying market structure.  The Council believes it would be in Hong Kong's best interest to encourage competition, improve the working of the market and safeguard against possible abuse of market power by:
	<OL TYPE=1 START=1>
	<LI> improving the competitiveness of the market structure by lowering barriers to entry and increasing the substitutability between primary and secondary market housing,
	<LI> introducing measures to prevent possible anti-competitive market behaviour, and 
	<LI> enhancing consumers' market role by facilitating their access to reliable property information.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1> Recommendation 1:<BR>
Lower Barriers to Entry </FONT>

<P>
<OL TYPE=1 START=53>
<LI> Increasing the number of players would help to improve market efficiency through increased competition.  The Government can seek to encourage new entry to the property market as it has in the telecommunications market; and systematically consider the implications on competition of policies which directly or indirectly affect the property market.  We ask the Government to:

	<BR><BR><BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;<U> Review the size of lots in Government land auctions </U>

	<BR><BR>
	<OL TYPE=1 START=1>
	<LI> Consider ways of removing impediments to small developers seeking to compete in auctions of prime development land.  Obviously, lot sizes of 4 to 21 hectares such as that granted to the MTRC would be too big for most developers and require enormous capital outlay.  Government should review the sizes of the land lots, and consider providing more lots of "manageable size" in a way which would satisfy planning requirements and consumer aspirations for community facilities whilst allowing the participation of more developers. This may require Government to look imaginatively at ways in which the well-integrated environments and good facilities associated with developments on larger land sites can be delivered in developments on a series of adjoining land sites through detailed planning guidelines.
	</OL>

	<BR><BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;<U> Improve the efficiency of the development mechanism </U>

	<BR><BR>
	<OL TYPE=1 START=2>
	<LI> Allocate more resources to extend the fast-tracked and co-ordinated development mechanism to all residential development or redevelopment projects irrespective of size.  To ensure that faster processing of planning and building applications also increases private sector production rates, Government should monitor the effect of faster processing on the rate at which units in developments are put on the market in each case.
	</OL>

	<BR><BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;<U> Open more opportunities to new entrants </U>

	<BR><BR>
	<OL TYPE=1 START=3>
	<LI> Open more opportunities to new entrants by giving them a greater role in property development controlled or sponsored by Government and quasi-government corporations.  Possible channels would be the Private Sector Participation Scheme and residential projects facilitated by the Land Development Corporation (LDC) on redeveloped land.  For example:

		<BR><BR>
		<OL TYPE=i START=i>
		<LI> the Government or quasi-Government bodies could wherever possible develop projects in conjunction with contractors or smaller developers, enabling them to  develop the capacity to take on larger projects.  The Government should also consider developers' suggestion that developers require more incentives to participate in PSPS projects, such as greater freedom in project management, design and other parts of the development process;

		<BR><BR>
		<LI> we support the Government's decision announced in its Urban Renewal paper (June 1996) to enhance the role of the Land Development Corporation (LDC) by injecting financial resources and upgrading it to an Urban Renewal Authority. This will allow it more freedom to develop projects and to select partners for joint venture, thereby reducing its dependence on the resources of big developers.

</OL>

<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Recommendation 2:<BR>
Improve Residential Land Supply </FONT>

<P>
<OL TYPE=1 START=54>
<LI> The Government should:
	<OL TYPE=1 START=1>
	<LI>adopt a vigilant programme in land formation, and preparation of redeveloped land in order to ensure consistent land supply; and 
	<LI>outline its planned land sales for a rolling five-year period and maintain the year-on-year supply programme. This would particularly help new entrants who are largely dependent on Government supply.
	</OL>

<P>
<LI> The Council supports the Government's efforts to create a one-year land reserve as recommended by the 1994 Task Force.  This would work on the same principle as buffer stocks in primary strategic materials widely adopted by countries throughout the world.

<P>
<LI> For optimum use of existing land, the Government should:
	<OL TYPE=1 START=1>
	<LI> re-zone more obsolete industrial areas for residential purposes to reflect Hong Kong's changed economic base;
	<LI> consider public, and encourage private sector, investment in environmental and infrastructure improvements to make more disused industrial sites suitable for residential use;
	<LI> review the maximum permissible plot ratios in the outline zoning plans with the aim of relaxing the requirements where environmental and infrastructural factors permit.
	</OL>
</OL>

<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Recommendation 3: <BR>
Balance Housing Supply and Demand </FONT>

<P>
<OL TYPE=1 START=57>
<LI> The Government should urgently review its estimates of available supply, and discuss with the Real Estate Developers Association ways to improve the reporting of statistics to enable Government to keep abreast of changes in developers' assessments.

<P>
<LI> Government should support the private sector's role as facilitators in converting land into housing supply.  In particular, the Government should  examine and address causes of slippages external to the project.  For example: 
	<P>
	<OL TYPE=1 START=1>
	<LI> where developments depend on new infrastructure, consider the possibility of involving developers in its provision, and enhance cooperation between Transport and Lands, Planning and Building Departments;
	
	<BR><BR>
	<LI> with respect to planning and consent approvals, ensure the Administration has resources sufficient for the task and employ incentives, such as time limits in performance pledges, inter-office cooperation and a management strategy to ensure a fast, efficient and streamlined administrative process.  We believe that result of the Government's consultancy study to examine how the existing procedures and time for lease modifications and land exchanges can be further shortened, would lead to further improvements.
	</OL>

<P>
<LI> The ideal state is for the free market mechanism to work with minimal government involvement in the market.  However, even with the adoption of the above recommendations to improve the operation of the free market, competition in the market is unlikely to improve significantly in the short term.  In view of the limit on the pace of change in market structure and bearing in mind people's immediate accommodation needs, the Government should maintain reasonable regulatory control on developers.


<P>
<LI> The Government should ensure that the supply of residential properties meets demand, particularly given the scarcity of the land resource and the time taken to convert land into units. In line with the spirit of the building covenant, Government should:

	<P>
	<OL TYPE=1 START=1>
	<LI> improve the terms in the building covenant in the land lease to specify that developers are to make units available on the market within a specified period, giving a reasonable grace period, e.g. 6 months after the end of the covenant period. The Government would not dictate the specific timing, but only seek assurance about the supply of units to the market.  This part of the agreement should be well publicized at the time when the Government makes the land available and developers enter into the agreement; 

	<BR><BR>
	<LI> monitor developers' track record. If a developer's projects regularly slip behind the covenant date without valid reasons, then Government should take this into account in considering further applications by that developer for, for example, fast-track development procedures or applications for land modification.
	</OL>

<P>
<LI> For public sector housing supply:

	<P>
	<OL TYPE=1 START=1>
	<LI>the Government should ensure the declared target of 240,000 public units are produced and supplied steadily over the period 1997-2001 to meet its public sector targets. Failure to do this is likely to have an impact on private housing demand; and
	<LI> Government's announcement that the LDC will focus more on residential redevelopment is also welcome in this context.
	</OL>
</OL>

<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Recommendation 4:<BR>
Enhance Marketability of Older Properties and Property in Less Accessible Areas </FONT>

<P>
<OL TYPE=1 START=62>
<LI> There is an urgent need to integrate the housing markets, in particular to make older property a financeable prospect, in order to increase consumer choice and improve competition in the market as a whole.  This requires action to:

	<P>
	<OL TYPE=1 START=1>
	<LI> Increase confidence in tradability of older properties.
	
		<BR><BR>
		The imbalance between demand for new and old housing units would be reduced if banks become more confident in financing older properties.  The Council:
		<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
		<LI> supports the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors' proposal to devise a recognised building certification programme to assess the quality of existing buildings; and 
		<LI> will pursue with developers of new properties the provision of comprehensive building warranties to enhance the long-term saleability of properties.
		</UL>

		<BR>
		The Government should endorse the above initiatives.
		<BR><BR>
		The Council welcomes the Government's announcement of the introduction of a mandatory building inspection scheme; proposal to give owners' corporations more powers to upgrade the common parts of a building; and proposed Rehabilitation Fund for renovation work. <B><A HREF="#FN15">  15  </A></B>C

	<BR><BR>
	<LI> Facilitate mortgage financing.

		<BR>
		<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
		<LI>The Consumer Council considers the Government's proposed mortgage corporation would facilitate an increase in residential mortgage loans.  The Council therefore supports the move, with the proviso that the risk management aspects of the arrangement are properly addressed; and that the initiative will result in easier access to loans for older properties.
		<LI> The Council recommends that Government considers ways to encourage the setting up of specialized mortgage agencies. Such agencies would increase choice for the consumer, and enhance the accessibility of home financing for financially responsible home-buyers who are unable to meet the stringent criteria currently set by commercial banks. This will be particularly important if the mortgage corporation is not pursued,
		</UL>

	<BR><BR>
	<LI> Improve transport infrastructure 

	<BR>
	Housing demand would be eased by better utilisation of actual and potential property developments in less accessible areas.
	<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
	<LI>The Council recommends the Government take steps to improve the transportation and infrastructure planning for less accessible areas in order to enhance their viability and attractiveness to consumers.

<FONT SIZE=+1><B><U>Introducing Measures to Prevent Anti-Competitive Market Behaviour </U></B></FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Recommendation 5: <BR>
Establish Sector Specific Rules </FONT>

<P>
<OL TYPE=1 START=63>
<LI> Government should implement as soon as possible the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission on disclosure of information for new properties to equalize the treatment of developments under the Consent and Non-Consent Schemes.  In addition, the Government should extend the anti-speculation measures to Non-Consent Scheme developments in order to reduce the distorting effect of excessive speculation on the market and ensure uniform treatment.  Consumers cannot be expected to differentiate between Consent and Non-Consent Scheme developments.

<P>
<LI> Government should work with the Real Estate Developers' Association to develop a code of practice for residential property industry to improve consumer information by:
	<BR>
	<OL TYPE=1 START=1>
	<LI> the provision of adequate and accurate information in the sales literature;
	<LI> for non-consent scheme, agreement of the ways and means of placing the property on the market, such as the method of balloting for units which is  voluntarily practiced by REDA at present; and 
	<LI> mandatory use of saleable floor area instead of gross floor area as the standard measurement of flat size.
	</OL>
</OL>

<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Recommendation 6: <BR>
Ensure Fair Competition </FONT>

<P>
<OL TYPE=1 START=65>
<LI> The property development sector is at present not subject to any competition rules similar to that prescribed in the licences for Telecommunications operators and Broadcasters.  For the property development industry, this Council considers a territory wide competition law will suffice. Competition laws in other countries prohibit abuse of market power and actions which have the effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition in all but a few exempted sectors of the economy.  The laws may include various clauses which permit investigation of, for example, price fixing, collusion and tie-in sales, which are against the public interest. Such a territory wide competition law would guide the conduct of developers and other participants in the market.
</OL>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B><U> Facilitating Consumer Access to Reliable Property Information </U></B></FONT>

<P>
<OL TYPE=1 START=66>
<LI> Adequate market information helps the consumers to make decisions in the market on a rational basis, and in this way enables the market to operate efficiently.
</OL>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Recommendation 7:<BR>
Increase transparency of information </FONT>

<P>
<OL TYPE=1 START=67>
<LI> The Government should use Consent Scheme procedures to require developers to notify the Government of the timing of their sales programmes and units available in each sale; and whether those units will be for public or internal sale.  Developers should be able subsequently to modify the sale plans provided they first notify the Government and inform the public of any such changes.  This would help Government to make an accurate assessment of the housing supply, and increase information to potential buyers helping them to make informed decisions.  It is purely a notification procedure and does not imply any control or approval of developers' sales decisions.

<P>
<LI> The Government should also consider public access to its housing property data.  More accurate property data for consumers would help consumers make informed decisions and make them less vulnerable to market rumours.  The proposed integration of the departmental database can help to enhance the data collection and compilation mechanism within the Government, and should enable the Government to provide more timely and comprehensive analyses of the property market.

<P>
<LI> The Government should ensure that the performance pledges of the Government departments involved in land and property development promote transparency in the process, by including, for example, regular publication of information about the progress or delays to development projects, i.e. publish specific reasons for granting an extension of the building covenant period.

<hr size=3 width=100%><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consumer Council is encouraged that the Government has accepted some of its recommendations to promote competition in the television broadcasting market.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chairperson of the Council's Working Group for the study on Broadcasting Policy, Ms Anna Wu said : "We are encouraged by the response of the Government.  However we had hoped the response to be more definitive in terms of time and implementation."<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Wu stressed that whatever steps to be taken in future should be "clearly consistent" with the long-term objectives of enhancing competition in the dynamic television broadcasting market.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We need to monitor closely in view of the speed of technology change and competition in the region.  We need also the machineries and information that will react to changes sensitively and quickly," she added.<p>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Wu said that the Council had advocated for forward looking regulation in view of the speed of technological change and competition in the region, therefore carriers and programme providers should be licensed separately.  This should provide the flexibility to accommodate changes without requiring major amendments each time a new form of technology or service comes on stream.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, she noted that Government has recognized the need for a programme service licence for Video-on-Demand.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council is convinced that there is immense benefit in combining the policy responsibilities for both broadcasting and telecommunications under one policy branch and until then it is hoped that there will be more effective increased co-ordination between the various branches.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Council's proposal to facilitate more and fair competition, Ms Wu urged the Government to take the first available opportunity to review the free competition clauses in the broadcasting licences so as to ensure consistency and to make them more effective.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She noted Government's agreement to extend cross media ownership restrictions to the print media and looked forward to the annoucement of full details.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Council's proposal to allow recognised community bodies such as ICAC, civic education, social services and environmental groups access to community programming on television, Ms Wu urged the Government to review the issue and to enhance the ability of such groups to air their programmes.

<P>
	Substandard pressure cookers are potentially highly dangerous.  They pose serious risk of explosion.
<P>
	Indeed, two accidents of explosion involving pressure cookers were reported within five days of each other in July last year.  This prompted the Consumer Council to conduct a test on this product.
<P>
	Results of the test, released today in 'CHOICE', affirmed the concern that a high proportion of pressure cookers available to consumers here, may be unsafe for household use.
<P>
	The test samples were drawn not only locally but also from retail outlets in neighbouring Shenzhen and Zhu Hai in China.  Altogether 11 samples - 6 of aluminium make and 5 stainless steel - were tested with reference to China's National Standard and the British Standard.
<P>
	According to the test, over 70 percent of the test samples (8 out of 11) failed to comply with at least one or more of the safety requirements prescribed by both Standards.
<P>
	As such substandard products may be in violation of the Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance, which came into force in October last year, the Consumer Council has notified, at the first instance, the Customs and Excise Department of the test findings.
<P>
	It is understood that the Customs and Excise Department has launched an investigation but none of the pressure cookers in question could be found.
<P>
	The test focused on three major safety requirements - pressure, security of lid and blockage of safety device.  Out of the 11 samples, only 3 could fully pass the tests of one or both Standards.
<P>
<B>	Pressure tests</B>
<P>
<UL TYPE=square>
<LI>The Safety Standards required the manufacturer to list the nominal operating pressure of the pressure cooker so as to determine whether or not the utensil being tested conforms with the safety requirements.  Such information was, however, conspicuously missing on 3 of the samples in non-compliance with the Standards.
<BR>

<LI>4 other samples failed to meet the requirements in the pressure tests.
<BR>
<LI>In particular, 2 failed the bursting pressure test as they were unable to withstand 6 times the nominal operating pressure and resulted in leakage.
<BR>
<LI>2 also failed the test on the safety pressure relief device.  The device was activated only at pressures higher than the Standard values, thus relieving the built-up pressure under a far more dangerous condition.
<P>
</UL>
<B>Security of Lid</B>
<P>
<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI>First, it is required that the lid should not be released or removed with only a small internal pressure; otherwise the boiled-hot contents inside may burst out, burning and injuring the users nearby.  6 samples failed this safety test.
<BR>
<LI>Second, the inside pressure of the cooker must not exceed the safety values when the lid is not locked in position; otherwise the lid may be released and the boiled-hot contents split out.  3 samples failed in this safety requirement.
<P>
</UL>
<B>Blockage of Safety Device</B>
<P>

<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI>4 samples were found to be without the cap designed to prevent the blockage of the pressure regulating device while cooking.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
	The test also investigated the lead content of the spoiled piece in the destructible safety pressure relief device.  Under certain conditions, the spoiled piece may melt at high temperature.  Or the acidic steam from cooking acidic foods can release the lead from the spoiled piece, resulting in the contamination of food with lead.
<P>
	As lead is highly toxic, it should not be used in cooking ware.  3 samples were tested and it was revealed that the lead contents ranged from 38 percent to 98 percent.
<P>
	Consumers are strongly urged to consult the test report in this latest (236th) issue of the Consumer Council's monthly magazine 'CHOICE'.
<P>
	They are advised to read and follow the instructions closely, check that the pressure regulating device and the safety pressure relief device(s) are in order, and release the built-up pressure before open the lid of the pressure cooker.
<P>
<CENTER>         </CENTER><P>
<P>
	If ice cream is you - or your children's - favourite snack to beat the heat of summer, you should also be naturally concerned with its hygiene condition.
<P>

	Just how hygienic and safe is the array of ice cream products on sale at supermarkets and ice cream stores?
<P>
	To investigate this concern, the Consumer Council has analysed 51 ice cream products purchased from a diversity of sale outlets.
<P>
	The samples comprised 20 family size/cup size ice cream, 7 ice cream cones, 16 ice cream bars and 8 ice cream confection (ice cream fingers, ice cream cakes, etc.).  Most were of chocolate, vanilla and strawberry flavour.  The test focused on the hygiene and nutritional aspects :
<P>
<B>	Hygiene Condition</B>
<P>
	According to the Frozen Confections By-Laws, no person should sell, offer or expose frozen confection containing more than 50,000 bacteria per gram or more than 100 coliform organism per gram.  Those who fail to comply with the regulation may face a fine of $5,000, imprisonment for 3 months, and $150 for each day during which the offence has continued.
<P>
	The test revealed that 2 of the 51 samples analysed were found to have exceeded the statutory hygiene limits.
<P>
	One sample exceeded the standard of the Total Bacterial Count (TBC), which indicates the level of microorganisms in a product.  But even if a product's TBC exceeds the standard, it is harmful to health only if it contains pathogen.
<P>
	The other sample was detected to exceed both the TBC and Coliform standards.  Coliform is the predominate bacteria in gut which is found in human feces.  Some strains of coliform are not harmful to health while some strains may cause diarrhea and vomiting.
<P>
	Although the findings do not automatically render the 2 samples in question unfit for human consumption, they do indicate that the ice cream manufacturers and vendors should make an extra effort to improve the hygiene condition of their products.
<P>
	Supermarkets and ice cream retail outlets are advised to improve their management to ensure that refrigerators operate at the required temperature and that no products are being sold over a prolonged period of time.
<P>
	Ice cream caterers should also maintain proper hygiene practice such as washing hands after visiting the toilet, and keeping their uniforms clean to minimise the possibility of ice cream contamination.
<P>
	Consumers, on the other hand, are advised to pay heed to the packaging of ice cream products: packaging with leakage increases the possibility of bacterial contamination, ice covering the package indicates the product may have been thawed and refrozen again.
<P>
	Further, purchase of ice cream placed above the freeze line of fridge is not recommended since increased temperature encourages bacterial growth.  Retailers are responsible to ensure that all ice cream products are kept at appropriate compartments below the freeze line. 
<P>
<B>	Nutritional Aspects</B>
<P>	
	The samples were found with nutrients of: fat (5 to 28%), sugar (16 to 31%), protein (2 to 8%) and energy (137 to 365 calories).
<P>
	Among the products, ice cream bars with nuts and chocolate coating had the highest level of calories, followed by ice cream confections and cones.  Prepacked family size/cup size ice cream was ranked the lowest in calorie content.
<P>
	Parents are advised to keep their children's diet balanced; consuming too much ice cream may reduce their consumption of food containing essential nutrients for growth development such as vitamins and minerals.

	A Consumer Council survey has revealed a high level of consumer dissatisfaction with the quality of paging services between Hong Kong and China/Macau.
<P>
	According to the survey, based on the experience of some 3,000 users, only 32% and 34%, on average, of the respondents were satisfied with the Hong Kong/China, and Hong Kong/Macau paging service respectively.
<P>
	The satisfaction rate lagged significantly behind that for local paging service with a score of 55% on average.
<P>
	The satisfaction rate was based on 4 factors: message accuracy, operator politeness, transmission time and phone line pick-up time.
<P>
	The survey also indicated a 22% dissatisfaction rate with the time taken to get the repair services completed.  A faster repair service by paging companies is obviously desirable to reduce the inconvenience to consumers in repair service.
<P>
	A price survey of paging services, conducted in May, showed variations, in some cases considerably substantial, in the monthly service charges.
<P>
	For instance, the monthly charges for numeric paging service and secretarial numeric paging service ranged from $178 to $240 and $150 to $280 respectively.  And the charges for Chinese paging services and secretarial Chinese paging services ranged from $228 to $270 and $240 to $340 respectively.
<P>
	In choosing a paging company, consumers need to consider their own particular needs, for instance, whether paging service in areas other than Hong Kong is required or not.  In addition to the quality and price, consumers should also weigh such added value services as free informative message, connection with credit card, mobile phone, etc.
<P>
	The survey also noted the many promotion packages for pager in the market these days.  However, these packages may come with some conditions, such as requiring one year service to own the pager, or spreading the bonus over a long period of time.  Consumers will do well to consider these terms before joining a package.
<P>
<CENTER>         </CENTER>
<P><P>

	Buying a mobile phone is probably within reach of more people these days than ever before.  But choosing the right one to suit your own particular needs may still seem tricky.
<P>
	But help is on the way.  Included in this June issue of 'CHOICE' is a comprehensive report on the various types and standards of mobile phones - their pros and cons - to assist your purchasing decision.
<P>
	According to the report, the analog types of mobile phones are phasing out fast.  People are buying digitals.
<P>
	There are now 4 service operators using 3 different digital standards, namely, GSM, DAMPS and CDMA.  The GSM is a European standard and the latter two are American standards.
<P>
	They all utilize the radio spectrum efficiently and provide significantly higher communication capacity than the traditional analog standards.
<P>
	Consumers are advised to consult this report in 'CHOICE' to familiarise themselves with some knowledge about these standards before purchase.  In particular, if they prepare to use 'roaming' services (using their phones abroad), they should be even more careful in their choice.
<P>
	If consumers are likely to use their mobile phones locally only, the choice of phone standard is relatively less important.  Instead they should pay more attention to the quality of service of the operator.

<p>The season for swimming is on!  But before you head for the beach with your children, the Consumer Council has this advice for you.
<p>Check your children's swim gears - swim rings and arm bands, floats and goggles, and the like - to make sure that they are not mere aquatic toys.
<p>Because of their very limited uplift capacity, aquatic toys cannot be relied upon, in the event of an accident, as life saving devices.
<p>Aquatic toys, that fail to be labelled as such with the necessary warning, can be bought unwittingly by consumers for use without due care.
<p>Even more potentially dangerous is that some of these aquatic toys may not be in compliance with existing safety requirements.
<p>Between December 1994 and May 1995, the Customs and Excise Department's Trading Standards Investigation Bureau have initiated a total of 96 investigations against wholesalers and retailers of non-complying aquatic toys.
<p>Samples of the toys were tested by the Government Laboratory in accordance with the requirements of the Toys and Children's Products Safety Ordinance.  The test revealed :
<UL TYPE=disc><LI>All samples were without the mandatory safety warning: "Warning!  Only to be used in water in which the child is within its depth and under supervision."
<p><LI>Without such warning, consumers may not even know they are buying an aquatic toy instead of a life saving device.  Further, children may use these toys without due caution and parental supervision.
<p><LI>Some samples were without non-return valve whose function is to prevent the air inside the inflatable aquatic toys from quickly leaking out when the stopper of the valve is accidentally released.
</UL>
<p>The Customs and Excise Department has seized a total of 26,492 pieces of non-complying aquatic toys - swim rings (15,311 pieces), swim arm bands (8,848), beach boats (2,127), pool floats (53) and beach balls (153) - valued at $341,900.  The Department has also issued written warning to 21 wholesalers/importers and 50 retailers.
<p>In addition, a pair of goggles was identified to be potentially hazardous to use by swimmers.
<p>The transparent plastic lenses of the goggles were found broken into pieces when subjected to the "imitation protective equipment" test in accordance with the Toys and Children's Products Safety Ordinance.
<p>This poses a potential hazard of eye injury and may even lead to loss of eyesight in serious cases.
<p>The goggles in question also failed to display the mandatory safety warning : "Warning! Does not provide protection in the event of an accident".
<p>Consumers are urged to consult the report, in this 235th issue of the Consumer Council's monthly magazine 'CHOICE', to check if the goggles in their possession belong to this model.  If so, they should cease using them immediately and report to the Customs and Excise Department.
<center><p>         </center>

<p>Electric rice cookers have come to be used to prepare a multitude of foods other than just plain rice.
<p>In Hong Kong, it is customary for people to use rice cooker to steam dishes, prepare rice with meat and seasoning, to boil congee and soup, and even to use it as a cooking utensil for Chinese hotpot.
<p>But this could land you into trouble if your rice cooker is not designed for such purpose other than cooking plain rice.
<p>At least two complaints have been brought to the notice of the Consumer Council against a model of electronic rice cooker.  In both cases, fire was alleged to have started automatically at the hinge joint when the cooker was set at the 'keep warm' mode of operation.
<p>Both fires, fortunately, were swiftly spotted and put out by the complainants without further damage.
<p>It was believed that the fire originated at the connector, situated at the cooker's hinge, for connecting circuit to a low-power heater at the cooker's lid which operates during the 'keep warm' mode.
<p>The Consumer Council has put the cookers to tests to examine if they comply with fire safety.  It was found that the connector at the hinge came afire but because its size was so small the fire quickly burned itself out within the safety limit of 30 seconds.  The cooker was therefore considered to be in overall compliance with fire safety.
<p>It was believed that in the complaints cases, the rice cookers have been used to prepare food other than plain rice.  Traces of overflow (including spices and seasoning) were detected in one cooker in question and traces of spice were found in the other.	 In one cooker, the dew venting holes, situated at the hinge joint, were clogged with dried rice and foreign matters.  As the sticky fluid had entered the hinge joint, it got adhered to the connector, resulting in a flash over and fire.
<p>An examination of the user manual found that, first, there was no explicit warning that the cooker can only be used to cook plain rice, and, second, it failed to highlight the importance of keeping the dew venting holes unclogged.
<p>On the advice of the Consumer Council, the manufacturer has agreed to improve the safety design of the connector as well as the instructions in the user manual.
<p>Consumers using the same type of rice cookers that does not provide cooking schedule other than that for cooking plain rice, are advised to use with due care.  There are rice cookers that can provide more cooking methods than just for plain rice.
<center><p>         </center>

<p>The Consumer Council has expressed concern over the lack of clear labelling to enable consumers to identify if processed foods contain beef or beef derivatives.
<p>In this May issue of 'CHOICE' is published an "Inside Story" in the magazine of the UK Consumers' Association on the BSE crisis.
<p>The article stressed the importance of labelling.  Without such clear information, consumers are at risk of eating Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)-infected beef and beef products including mechanically-recovered meat (MRM).
<p>In the light of the UK findings, the Consumer Council will follow up with the relevant Government departments, food importers, manufacturers and the drug industry on the state of the situation on beef, beef products and drugs in Hong Kong.
<p>In the report, it was revealed that many processed foods in fact contain beef or beef derivatives, such as beef fat, stock, bone stock, beef extract or gelatine.
<p>But not only do the names of these processed foods can fail to tell the whole story, it can be impossible to tell if a product contains beef or its derivatives even if you read the small print on the label.
<p>Under existing UK labelling rules, manufacturers do not have to identify what types of meats are used.  Further, the definition of 'meat' is wide, and can include types of beef offal such as kidneys.
<p>But of more concern is that food producers are not required to disclose if their products contain mechanically - recovered meat (MRM).  MRM is left-over meat, gristle and bone which is literally blasted from the animal's carcass.
<p>According to the report, the UK Government banned vertebrae from use in MRM after it was found that spinal cord (which is a highly-infectious part of cattle with BSE) was not being properly removed from the vertebrae in slaughter-houses.
<p>But there was no recall of foods containing MRM, so some, with a long shelf life, may still be on sale.
<p>The British Consumers' Association has reported, in its "Inside Story", a number of foods found to contain beef or beef products.
<UL TYPE=disc><LI>Lamb stock cubes actually contained beef stock while beef extract was present in bacon and tomato sandwich fillers.
<p><LI>Biscuits, previously with beef fat from British beef, have since switched to using fat from foreign beef.
<p><LI>A major baby food manufacturer said that its beef recipes are all made with meat from either Holland or Ireland; others said their beef is not from British herds.
</UL>
<p>However, some foods though labelled to contain meat or fat suspected to be of beef, were actually without :
<UL TYPE=disc><LI>a spaghetti with 'meat boulders' lists 'burgers' as an ingredient which, according to the manufacturer, was made from a combination of pork, mutton and chicken.
<p><LI>The 'animal fat' in a pudding was actually from fish oil, not beef fat.
</UL>
<p>This demonstrates the importance of clear food labellings to assist consumer choice.
<p>Gelatine, on the other hand, which is found in a wide range of sweets and desserts, has now been ruled risk free by the World Health Organisation.
<p>The report also cited these statistics: since 1988, the UK has reported more than 160,000 cases of BSE.  This compares with 123 in Ireland, 13 in France and 4 in Germany.  In Ireland and France, whole herds are slaughtered if just one cow has BSE.
<p>In view of the lack of scientific evidence available that can predict the level of the risk of BSE with any security, the British Consumers' Association has recommended to the UK Government :
<UL TYPE=disc><LI>Clear labelling so that consumers can identify foods containing beef and beef products, including mechanically recovered meat.
<p><LI>Further research into how the disease is spread and which parts of the animal carry the highest risk.  The science to test for BSE in cattle needs developing urgently.
<p><LI>An independent food agency should be set up to work in the interests of the public, without being compromised by industry.  The UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food currently represents the meat industry as well as consumers.
</UL>
<p>The Consumers' Association also has this advice to offer : "if you want to continue eating beef, you can considerably reduce the risk of eating BSE-infected meat by sticking to 'muscle' meat and avoiding beef products.
<p>"Foods most likely to contain BSE-infected beef are those which contain MRM and offal.  If food manufacturers were required to identify the type of meat or animal fats in their foods, and to indicate whether MRM or offal was used, consumers would be able to make informed choices about what they eat".
<p>Until then, if you are concerned about the contents of a particular product, contact the manufacturer for details, or ask at your supermarket.
<p>Meanwhile, Consumers International (CI), the international federation of 212 consumer organisations in 87 countries, at its Executive meeting in Harare on April 25-27, 1996, has agreed an action programme on BSE. 
<p>Safe food is a priority for all consumers and all governments should adopt a precautionary policy and eliminate BSE from the food chain.  Consumers International has issued a policy on BSE and will be seeking to ensure that it is implemented.
<p>For this purpose, CI has asked all members to approach their governments to obtain information on the incidence of BSE and CJD in their countries.  This information will be used to prepare a report so that consumer organisations can monitor the situation and take all the steps within their power to protect consumers.

<p>Credit card consumers are paying excruciatingly high interest rates for the convenience of using plastic money.
<p>A Consumer Council survey has revealed that consumers could be paying interest rates for the money they owe credit card issuers at 2 to 3.5 percent per month.  Or 24 percent to 42 percent per annum.
<p>But depending on the banks or finance companies that issue the credit cards, in the majority of the cases, the interest rates are between 24 to 30 percent per annum.
<p>This is nevertheless substantially higher than interest rates being charged by credit cards in the United States or Japan.
<p>The extent of the excess is 37 to 71 percent more than the U.S. (17.5 percent p.a.) and 82 to 127 percent than Japan (13.2 percent p.a.).
<p>The significantly higher rates of interests are charged in Hong Kong despite a lower bad debt rate of 1.58 percent.  Generally, bad debt provision includes such factors as non-repayment, forged signature and the use of false credit cards, etc.
<p>Hong Kong's bad debt rate is less than half of that of the U.S. (3.5 percent) and is about the same as Japan (1 to 2 percent).
<p>Results of the survey which covered 19 banks and finance companies issuing credit cards in Hong Kong, were published today in the latest (234th) issue of the Consumer Council's monthly magazine 'CHOICE'.
<p>The Council's survey has showed that the difference between the highest and the lowest interest rates charged by credit card issuers could be as much as 1.5 percent per month.  This means that for a debt of $10,000, the difference in the interest charge alone is $150 a month.  Such expense could go up with the addition of various other surcharges.
<p>And in the case of an outstanding balance of $10,000 fully settled 180 days (6 months) later, the difference in the interest charge by different card issuers could reach $678.  In the case of a cash advance of $10,000 repaid 100 days later, the difference between the highest interest charge and the lowest is $541.
<p>Consumers are therefore advised to choose - and use - credit cards with care paying particular attention to the costs of such credit facility and not just the attraction of gifts and bonuses.
<p>Consumers should pay heed to such costs as the joining fee, annual fee, cash advance charges, finance charges for outstanding debt, and other miscellaneous fees.
<p>The report cautions consumers to think carefully before committing themselves to debts in the use of credit cards.  If every time the card holder settles only the minimum monthly payment, even a small outstanding balance could turn into a long term burden of debt escalated by high interest rates and a host of other surcharges.
<p>For an outstanding balance of $5,000, for instance, if the card holder repays only the minimum (5 percent) at a monthly interest rate of 2.5 percent, it would take him a total of 7 years and 5 months for the account to be fully settled.  The amount of interests paid would be $4,212 or 84 percent of the original sum of debt.
<p>Besides the high interest rates, the report also noted the complex methods of calculation of interest charges and surcharges which all add up to the staggering costs of owing plastic money.
<p>The report drew the attention of credit card users to such "penalty traps" as :
<UL TYPE=disc><LI>imposing finance charge from the very date of transaction;
<LI>waiving interest-free-period for all new transactions for accounts with outstanding balance;
<LI>charging a handling fee for cash advance and effecting interest charge from the very date of cash advance;
<LI>late payment charge for failure to repay on the due date;
<LI>surcharge for bounced cheques or autopay payments;
<LI>charging a "cash deposit fee" if you pay your account with cash, etc.</UL>
<p>Meanwhile, the Council has received complaints that debt collection agents have harrassed people acting as personal reference in credit card application when the card holders failed to repay or simply disappeared.
<p>At present, the names of personal reference are used in application form without the need for prior consent of the referees.
<p>The Consumer Council hopes that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Association of Banks would soon be able to introduce a code of practice that would require the consent of the personal referee before his or her name is used in the application.
<p>Further, it should be stipulated that the referee will have no obligation for the debt of the applicant(s) in the event of nonpayment.
<center><p>         </center>
<p>A mobile phone can only be as good as the battery if it is to function at all.  And, in turn, a battery is dependable on the battery charger to replenish its energy.
<p>In this April issue of 'CHOICE' is a test report on these two very essential paraphernalia of mobile phone usage.
<p>The test examined 16 models of battery in combination with 8 models of digital cellular phone.  Another 15 models of battery charger were tested for their safety.
<p>The "Talk Time and Standby Time" results of the test conducted in laboratory using a standard "GSM cellular phone test set" are startling :
<p><B>Talk Time</B>
<p>The length of the talk time the battery samples could provide ranged from 1 hour 3 minutes to 6 hours 51 minutes in the absence of the Discontinuous Transmission (DTX) energy saving mode provided by the GSM networks.
<p>But the talk time was considerably increased, by 30 to 50 percent, from 1 hour 23 minutes to 9 hours 42 minutes with the operation of the DTX energy saving mode.
<p>The test showed that, as a general rule, for the same type of batteries, the heavier the battery, the longer the talk time it supplies.
<p>According to the test, the lithium ion battery, though more expensive, fared significantly better in performance than the other types of battery of the same weight.  
<p><B>Standby Time</B>
<p>The time between starting and the signal of Low Battery warning was measured to be between 10 hours to 50 hours despite claims by phone manufacturers that the standby time should be longer.
<p>The report offers these simple tips for consumers to enhance the performance of talk time/standby time from their batteries :
<UL TYPE=disc><LI>Energy Saving Mode<br>This has been shown to increase the operating time by 30 to 50 percent.  Consumers may wish to check with their network company and their phone supplier (a) if the DTX mode could be used, (b) if the DTX mode is already turned on by the handset manufacturer and (c) the procedures for DTX mode to be selected at the handset.
<p><LI>Users' Mobility<br>If the phone user is in constant mobility travelling from one place to another, it will consume more energy of the battery.  In this case, the user will do well to have a spare battery on hand.
<p><LI>Network Coverage<br>If the user needs to stay for a long time in a No Service area (where the network's signal strength is weak or non-existent), the user is advised to switch off the phone completely or select "Periodic Searching" instead of "Continuous Searching" to save energy.
</UL>
<p>In the test on battery chargers, 7 out of the 15 samples were found to be electrically unsafe. The main problems which pose potential hazards of electric shock or even electrocution, involved overheating and inadequate electrical insulation of the coils in the power supply.
<p>Further, all the samples were found to lack (a) user instructions and warnings (b) marking indicating the nature of electricity supply and (c) marking indicating the classification of the appliance, e.g. a sign for Class II appliances with double insulation.
<center><p>         </center>
<p>The Consumer Council welcomes the introduction of the Electricity (Amendment) Bill 1996, which paves the way for the long-awaited Electrical Product (Safety) Regulation.
<p>The new regulation requires suppliers of all electrical products designed for household use be responsible to ensure products they supply should comply with certain safety requirements so as to ensure users to be protected from electric shock and other dangers.
<p>From 1991 to 1995, 28 severe electrical accidents relating to electrical products which involved death and injury were reported to the Director of Electrical and Mechanical Services.  In some cases, death or injury could have been prevented if the electrical products involved were properly designed to protect user against electric shock.

<p>The Consumer Council today issued a severe warning to parents with young children to avoid buying unsafe folding tables for use at home.
<p>Small folding tables hold a certain fatal attraction for young children. At least 8 young children lost their lives in the deadly grip of the folding legs of the table.
<p>These fatalities were recorded during the period 1984 to 1989. But just 2 weeks ago, a baby girl, aged 1K years, was reported to be involved in an accident in which she was trapped by a folding table and had to be rescued by firemen.
<p>In the fatalities, the victims, invariably aged from 3 to 9 years, were found dead after being wedged in the iron bar legs of the folding tables which had been turned upside down.
<p>The children had crawled into the legs of the overturned folding table while playing. The legs folded up on impact, trapping and subsequently strangulating the victims.
<p>Once trapped by the table, it would be quite impossible for the child to extricate by himself from the grip of the iron bars as the bars would only get tighter with each force of struggle.
<p>Common in all these tragedies, the children were left alone or unattended at home at the time of the accidents. Their lives would certainly have been saved if adults were around to give a helping hand to free them from the deadly grip of the folding tables.
<p>The Consumer Council has long been concerned with the safety of folding tables and has issued guidelines and suggestions for manufacturers to improve the design of their products.
<p>Folding tables are commonly found in many homes here because of their extreme economy in the use of space. Primarily designed for such purpose as dining and mahjong, they are fast being marketed for use by children for such school chores as homework and drawing.
<p>Such folding tables are smaller, lighter and usually attractively designed with bright colours to appeal to children.
<p>Folding tables are now under the control of the Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance which came into operation last October. Under the ordinance, it is an offence for any person to manufacture, import or supply consumer goods which fail to comply with the general safety requirements or any prescribed safety standards.
<p>In the first test of folding tables since the enforcement of the new ordinance, the Consumer Council has focused on the small folding tables favoured by young children.
<p>The samples consisted of 4 tables with safety locking device and 1 without such device to prevent accidental folding up of the table. Since there is no international standard for folding tables, the products must at least satisfy the general safety requirements stipulated in the ordinance.
<p>The results of this latest test on folding tables - published in this March (233) issue of the Council's monthly magazine 'CHOICE' - showed that the safety of small folding tables was still far from entirely satisfactory.
<p>Of the 4 samples with locking device, only the spring type model can engage automatically, preventing accidental folding up of the table. The other 3 models - the hook, the screw and the metal stopper types - had to be locked manually.
<p>It is essential that the locking device should be able to engage automatically in case the users forget to lock the device. This is particularly true of young children who may not recognise the importance of the locking device or simply cannot properly operate the device.
<p>Other failures include: when the tables were turned upside down, the hook type locking device was released due to force of centre of gravity thus rendering the device no longer able to hold the table legs in position.
<p>The test found 2 locking devices to be easily removed without the use of tools while 1 to shift to other position thus losing the function it was intended for.
<p>Further, 3 tables were found to overturn when a vertical force was applied at the centre of the top of the rectangular shaped table along the short side. Never, therefore, use the folding table as a stepping stool.
<p>One sample actually carried a warning notice i.e. not to overturn the table for use as a toy. This is to be encouraged but the message in this sample was not sufficiently clear to alert parents to the potential hazard of misuse.
<p>The Consumer Council has informed the Customs and Excise Department, responsible for the enforcement of the ordinance, of the test findings.
<p>The Department has carried out a territory wide spot check exercise on small folding tables and sent samples for tests by the Government Laboratory. Similar test results were produced: all of the 4 test samples (2 without any locking device, 1 with hook type and 1 with screw type devices) failed to have an effective locking device.
<p>A series of raids in the past 3 months have resulted in the seizure of 371 small folding tables valued at $26,000.
<p>In the report is also included comprehensive guidance on the choice of a reasonably safe small folding table. Parents are strongly advised to consult the report and to ensure the safety of small folding tables for use by their young children.

<p>Competition in the mobile phone service market has driven prices down - at a rate much to the delight and chagrin of consumer.
<p>In a bid to compete for customers and market share, mobile phone service operators are offering a host of price-slashing packages in the market.
<p>Consumers are inundated with a plethora of advertising claims. But no sooner has one package been promoted a new package is on the offer.
<p>To assist consumers in their choice of the package that will best suit their own individual needs, the Consumer Council has conducted a survey on the various promotional schemes available in the market.
<p>The results of survey, published in this March issue of "CHOICE"', revealed considerable variations in the benefits offered by different mobile phone service operators.
<p>According to the survey, these packages contained one or more of the following main components :
<UL TYPE=disc><LI>acquire the service at a preferential price
<LI>swap from analog to digital network at a preferential price free talking time plan
<LI>peak-use/non-peak-use service charge package</UL>
<p>Of the various service packages sampled, the cheapest 650-minute package costs just $1.54 per minute on average for heavy user while the lowest service charge for a 100-minute or less-than-100-minute plan ranges from $3.75 to $5 per minute on average.
<p>For consumers who have to make round-the-clock calls, they may wish to consider a service with the longest non-peak-use period spanning from 6:00p.m. to 9:00a.m.
<p>For the money-minded, the cheapest non-peak-use service package costs $1 per minute, while the package with the lowest peak-use service charges $1.6 per minute.
<p>Consumers are advised to familiarise themselves with the different types of mobile phones and networks before they decide to invest in the use of mobile phone service.
<p>They should think twice before acquiring or swapping for a mobile phone at preferential rate because making an exit before the contract ends might incur a penalty given the consumers have already handed in the prepaid fees and deposits. Consumers should also read thoroughly the service charges in different time slots.
<center><p>         </center>

<p>Mobile phones are not the only communications equipment with prices in a downward trend. Prices of fax machines have also dropped significantly.
<p>No longer are they used exclusively in the office but have increasingly found their way into the home as prices become more affordable at only around 1,600 for some models.
<p>To evaluate the performance of this new generation of home fax machines, the Consumer Council has tested 15 small sized fax machines.
<p>Most of the samples are designed with an array of features and all print messages on special heat sensitive paper.
<p>The results of the test showed that the machines do vary significantly from one to another and in particular in respect of transmission speed and print image quality.
<p>Consumers are advised to choose carefully according to their own particular needs and application. For instance, a fast machine is recommended if they have to send fax overseas frequently.
<p>Advice is also given in the report on the different methods for connecting fax machine to phone line. Different methods have their own advantages and disadvantages.
<center><p>         </center>

<p>March 15 is the VVorld Consumer Rights Day.
<p>The theme chosen for this year's World Consumer Rights Day is "Safe Food for All".
<p>This coincides with the Food and Agriculture Organisation's (FAG) World Food Summit to be held in Rome in November this year.
<p>Locally, serious concern has been raised in such areas : pesticide contaminants in vegetables, seafood contamination by heavy metals and sour milk issues.
<p>Globally, it is noted that food marketing is targeting increasingly towards children, especially those for snacks and sweet treats. This may cause adverse effects on the nutritive value of their diet affecting childhood development. Also, food advertisements in magazines or other publications may be falsely disguised as editorial reporting.
<p>Government as well as food manufacturers are urged to play an important role in ensuring food safety, appropriate quality control and food labelling.

<h3><STRONG>COMPETITION POLICY : <BR>
THE KEY TO HONG KONG'S FUTURE ECONOMIC SUCCESS<BR>
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</STRONG></h3>
</TABLE>
<hr size=3 width=100%>
</CENTER>

<P>
<STRONG>HONG KONG'S ECONOMIC CHALLENGES</STRONG>

<P><OL TYPE=1 START=1><LI>
Hong Kong has enjoyed great success in recent decades.  It has experienced strong and sustained real GDP growth and has amongst the highest GDP per capita in the world.  It's strong economic performance has been due in part to its strategic geographical location on the doorstep of China and easy access to other South East Asian countries.  The advent of telecommunication technology and other forms of communication has, however, lessened the importance of Hong Kong's geographical advantage.  At the same time Hong Kong's advantages in other areas have been narrowing as Hong Kong's competitors continue to transform their economies and adopt laws and policies which encourage foreign trade and investment.  Hong Kong therefore faces an enormous challenge in maintaining its competitive edge.

<P><LI>
In the past two decades, Hong Kong has undergone an economic structural change from a manufacturing-based economy to a service economy.  The services sector has rapidly expanded and replaced the manufacturing sector as the major economic activity in Hong Kong, and the export of services has become an important impetus for economic growth.  The Hong Kong Government expects the services sector to be the engine of future economic growth and has said that it will ensure that the markets for services are as open and competitive as possible.

<P><LI>
Not all markets in service sectors are automatically highly competitive under a laissez-faire regime.  Unlike the manufacturing sector, in which most goods are traded in the international market and therefore subject to international competition, the services sector includes some services which can only be provided domestically.  Such services, for example, legal and accounting services, medical and dental services, public utilities, local radio and television broadcasting, retail banking services and other services such as restaurants and supermarkets are, therefore, insulated from international competition. 

<P><LI>
In its earlier studies of key sectors of the Hong Kong economy, the Consumer Council found a low level of competition in several sectors, eg, bank deposits, supermarket sales and gas supply.

<P><LI>
High property and wage costs in Hong Kong, which account for a substantial and increasing percentage of overall operating costs, particularly in the service sector are a matter of real concern.  The Hong Kong Competitiveness Report, commissioned by Vision 2047 Foundation which is supported by prominent business leaders in Hong Kong has succinctly summarised the challenge for Hong Kong as follows: "Cost pressures felt in Hong Kong have highlighted the need for improved competitiveness and cost effectiveness throughout the economy.  While free and open competition has long been the case in the traded sectors of the Hong Kong economy, this has not been the case in some non-traded sectors.   Since they do not face direct competition, it is important to ensure that the monopolies and oligopolies found in Hong Kong operate at maximum efficiency." <A HREF="#NOTES1"> 1</A>

<P><LI>
In a similar vein the HongkongBank in its Economic Report for September/October 1996 said, "Maintaining  external competitiveness, particularly in the service sector, will be one of the main challenges......rising service export prices primarily reflect the generally higher cost of operating in Hong Kong.  Between 1991 and 1995, nominal wages rose by an average of 9.5%......occupancy cost in Hong Kong also ranks among the highest in the region". <A HREF="#NOTES2"> 2</A>

<P><LI>
A comprehensive competition policy and a body of law can remove barriers to entry and ensure free competition which is not distorted by price fixing, market sharing or other anti-competitive practices.  This will have the overall benefit of keeping operating costs at a competitive level.

<P><LI>
It is important, therefore, that competition should be encouraged. It should, however, be stressed that the an important aim of competition policy is to  keep intervention to a minimum by setting clear ground rules that ensure fair play.   Once the ground rules are in place it should not normally be necessary for the body responsible for administering the policy to intervene in the affairs of companies.
</OL>


<P><BR><STRONG>THE INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION</STRONG>

<P><OL TYPE=1 START=9><LI>
There is also an international dimension to the need for a new approach. International bodies, such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO), are increasingly making links between competition policy and trade policy.  Hong Kong's ability to argue for improvements in trade policy and to argue against measures which may damage its interests will be hampered by the absence of a competition law at home.  International bodies and other states are starting to perceive problems both in particular areas of Hong Kong's economy and in the general absence of a competition law.

<P><LI>
With its free trade policy, Hong Kong is well placed to argue for international competition policy to replace traditional protectionist trade policy and discriminatory measures such as anti-dumping action.  However, Hong Kong's influence will undoubtedly be weakened by its lack of a comprehensive domestic competition policy.

<P><LI>
The open nature of Hong Kong's economy and the clear advantages it has over other cities in the region ameliorated the effects of this lack in the past.  The Government has been able to operate a policy of introducing specific solutions for specific problems.  However, in the changing economic climate the old policy will no longer suffice.
</OL>


<P><STRONG>THE ADVANTAGES OF INTRODUCING A COMPREHENSIVE COMPETITION POLICY</STRONG>

<P><OL TYPE=1 START=12><LI>
In a series of reports issued over the past two years, the Consumer Council has identified industries where imperfections in the market have raised prices to consumers and businesses.  It has received other complaints which it could not investigate because it lacked adequate powers.  There is no doubt that there are sectors where a lack of competition is forcing up prices and thus fuelling inflation.  If Hong Kong does not adopt a comprehensive competition policy it denies itself an effective weapon in the fight to maintain its international competitiveness.  The experience of introducing competition, even though limited, into the telecommunications market shows how effective competition can be in bringing down prices.

<P><LI>
Most developed economies have competition law. Newly industrialised economies such as South Korea and Taiwan have such laws and the Anti-unfair Competition Law of Mainland China includes provisions against price-fixing and abuse of dominance.

<P><LI>
For business a comprehensive competition policy has the advantages of fairness, consistency and reduced regulation.  It is fair because it acts against anti-competitive practices that can drive efficient and well-run companies out of business.  It is consistent because it is applied by a single authority working to a single set of published rules. The Government's present piecemeal approach has led to differences in the competition provisions of licences issued to broadcasting companies.  Provisions in the telecommunications licences are more specific and clearly set out than that contained in the broadcasting licences.

<P><LI>
A comprehensive policy can lead to a reduction in regulation.   It is pro-active, efficient and effective avoiding the need to commit manpower and time to devising new rules when new products or markets emerge.  

<P><LI>
Competition policy recognises that there are some natural monopolies  where factors such as economies of scale make it more efficient to have one operator but the competition authority would work closely with the regulators and would review existing or proposed regulations and report to the Government on whether they have significant adverse effects that might outweigh the benefits.

<P><LI>
For the consumer, the experience of competition policy in Hong Kong as it has been applied in specific sectors such as telecommunications and banking is that it leads to lower prices, product innovations, more choices and improved services.  An improvement in the coverage of competition law and a reduction in the time taken to remove barriers to competition must be good news for the consumer. 
</OL>


<P><BR><STRONG>RECOMMENDATIONS</STRONG>

<P><OL TYPE=1 START=18><LI>
The Consumer Council strongly recommends the adoption of a comprehensive competition policy and enactment of a general competition law in Hong Kong.   Competition law is an integral part of policy.  This is because legal enforcement is the only transparent and effective way to prevent and deal with restrictive conduct.

<P><LI>
The aim is to create a policy which is pragmatic and cost effective. The proposals on the design of such a policy are not intended to be prescriptive but to provide a starting point for further work if the recommendation to adopt comprehensive competition policy is accepted.  


<P><B>Competition Policy</B>

<P><LI>
The Consumer Council believes that an effective competition policy requires a wide-ranging and pro-active approach to promoting competition. To achieve this, the Consumer Council recommends:

<P>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>
action to promote an understanding of the aims of competition policy within Government as a whole, the business community and members of the public;

<P><LI>
a new system or procedure to ensure Government decisions and the design of all Government policies and decisions give regard to the implications on competition.  The procedure might be similar to that of  environmental impact assessments required for major government policy decisions (where applicable).   New proposals for regulation should be scrutinised to filter out those that are not strictly necessary; 

<P><LI>
scrutiny of existing regulations to ensure that they are still necessary, effective and/or their objectives could not be achieved by other means, e.g. a review of statutory monopolies, procedures for awarding franchises, and Scheme of Control industries with the aim of increasing competition at the earliest possible opportunity.
</OL>


<P><B>Competition Law</B>

<P>
<LI>
The Consumer Council strongly recommends the enactment of a competition law to cover horizontal and vertical collusive agreements and abuse of dominant position, to be expressed in the Articles 1 and 2 below.  This is a pragmatic approach suitable to Hong Kong.

<P><OL TYPE=a>
<LI>
Article 1: to prohibit explicit agreements between firms that are intended or have the effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition.  These include horizontal agreements such as those involved in price-fixing cartels, bid-rigging, etc and vertical agreements such as retail price maintenance, exclusive dealership, tie-in sales, long-term supply contracts, etc.

<P><LI>
Article 2: to prohibit any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position that prevents, restricts or distorts competition.   This would address monopoly pricing, and vertical restraints such as tie-in sales enforced through market dominance.
</OL>

<P><LI>
Without these articles, the competition legislation would not only be much less effective but not necessarily accepted as adequate in the international arena.  

<P><LI>
The proposed competition law should also include: 

<P><OL TYPE=a>
<LI>
an article controlling the abuse of collective dominance; and

<P><LI>
an article for the control of mergers and acquisitions. 
</OL>


<P><LI>
There are, however, pragmatic arguments for delaying the introduction of these two articles.  The arguments are finely balanced and the Consumer Council recommends that the Government decides how to proceed in the light of the debate that will follow the publication of this report.


<P><B>Exemptions</B>

<P><LI>
The Consumer Council recommends that exemptions to Articles 1 and 2 should be strictly controlled and, where possible, time-limited, in order to be consistent and fair to all industries.  Where possible, the Competition Authority should publish a block exemption which would remove the need for companies to seek individual exemption.


<P><B>Administrative Framework</B>

<P><LI>
The Consumer Council recommends:

<P>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>
a Competition Authority should be established to investigate and decide on possible breaches of the Competition Law;  and

<P><LI>
an Appeal Body should be established to hear appeals against decisions by the Competition Authority.
</OL>

<P><B>Competition Authority Structure</B>

<P>
<LI>
The Consumer Council recommends that:

<P><OL TYPE=a>
<LI>
the Competition Authority should be an independent body outside the civil service; 

<P><LI>
the Competition Authority should have a full-time chairman and other members appointed by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</OL>


<P><B>Duties</B>

<P>
<LI>
The Consumer Council recommends that the Authority should be given the following duties:

<P><OL TYPE=a>
<LI>
to advise the Government on competition policy;

<P><LI>
to ensure compliance with the Competition Law;

<P><LI>
to consider and suggest reforms to the relevant legislation; and

<P><LI>
in addition, the Competition Authority should have a widely defined general public interest 'deregulation' duty, to become aware of circumstances leading to a lack of market contestability and, in the performance of this or his specific duties, to recommend to Government changes to regulation to facilitate competition in the public interest.  Such recommendations should be made public.
</OL>


<P><B>Powers</B>

<P>
<LI>
The Consumer Council recommends that the Competition Authority should have powers to:

<P><OL TYPE=a><LI>
initiate investigations, or to act on the recommendations of others; and

<P><LI>
issue notices requiring the company to cease and desist from a practice deemed to be illegal, if in the course of its investigation, the Authority is satisfied that such a practice is illegal.
</OL>

<P><LI>
Consideration should also be given on whether the Competition Authority should have injunctive powers.


<P><B>Penalties</B>

<P>
<LI>
The options for consideration are whether simply to rely on injunctive powers, or to impose fines or award compensation to third parties.


<P><B>Appeal Body</B>

<P>
<LI>
The Consumer Council recommends that the Competition Authority's decisions are subject to review by an Appeal Body rather than the courts.  Decisions of the Appeal Body would be final. The Appeal Body should be clearly separated from the Competition Authority.

<P><LI>
The Chairman of the Appeal Body should be appointed by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.  The Chairman should convene and chair tribunals, to deal with specific cases on an ad hoc basis.  The other members should have experience relevant to competition and business.

<P><LI>
The tribunals should publish detailed reports of their findings, withholding only commercially sensitive information.
</OL>

<P><BR><STRONG>CONCLUSION</STRONG>

<P><OL TYPE=1 START=35><LI>
Hong Kong has enjoyed great success in the past but its advantages are narrowing as its competitors transform their economies and adopt laws and policies that enhance their competitiveness in international trade.  To stay ahead, Hong Kong can no longer afford to ignore the problems that stem from a lack of clear rules against anti-competitive practices and an Authority to enforce them. Hong Kong's position in the world economy will be jeopardised if it is unable to play a full role in the international debate on competition and trade policy now taking place.

<P><LI>
It is, however, essential that the changes Hong Kong adopt reflect its own culture and traditions. The time has come for the debate to move on from the question of whether Hong Kong should have a competition law to ensuring it has a law that will safeguard future prosperity.  Devising such a law needs the constructive engagement and active support of the whole community.

<B>Methodology</B>

<P><OL TYPE=1 START=1><LI> The HKPU analysed the occupation permit figures from the Rating and Valuation Department.  Nine publicly listed development companies plus two private companies were found to have had a substantial share of the new housing production market in recent years. The analysis included all housing projects undertaken in the names of developers' the subsidiary companies. <SUPER><A HREF=#FN3-1>1</A></SUPER>C

<P><LI> Housing units in a joint venture project were apportioned among the involved developers in accordance with their respective shares in the development.  Where a developer had a joint venture with organizations which are not ordinarily in the property development business, such as the site owners, no apportionment was made and all the housing units were counted as the supply of that developer.</OL><BR>

<P><B>Overall Pattern</B>

<P><OL TYPE=1 START=3><LI> <A HREF=#TBL3-1>Table 1 </A> indicates that, from 1991 to 1994, these eleven developers altogether produced between 60-86% of the annual total number of private housing units, about 63-89% in terms of the total residential floor space produced.  The remaining market production is believed to be shared by fringe players in the market.

<LI> There is obviously a high concentration of new private housing supply from a few developers. In particular, Developers A, B and C are the three corporate developers which consistently came within the top five producers of private housing units in the market in the four year period. Developer A was consistently the largest producer, both in terms of residential units and floor space. In three out of the four years, Developer A produced not less than 28% of the total number of housing units and 29% of the total domestic floor space. Only in 1993 did these figures drop to 15% and 17%, respectively.  This was also the year in which we see a decrease in the market share of all these major developers.
</OL>

<P><B> Market Share By Flat Size </B>

<P><OL TYPE=1 START=6><LI> The market concentration of these developers in different housing classes was also examined. These housing classes are based upon the conventional flat size classifications used by the Rating and Valuation Department.

<P><LI> Tables 3 & 4a-e present the findings. Generally speaking, the total market share of these eleven developers was very high in nearly all housing classes. In particular, these developers appear to dominate the supply of Housing Classes B and C, i.e. flats with a unit saleable area of 40 sq.m. to 99.9 sq.m. For these types of flats, their combined market share for each of the years 1991-1994 was consistently higher than their market shares of total housing production (ie all classes). The figures ranged from 62% to 93%! </OL>

<LI> Tables 4a-e  indicate the rankings, in terms of market share in production, of the top three developers in the five Housing Classes, respectively. It is inappropriate to only present the top five rankings because many of the developers did not have any production of a particular flat type in some years.

<P>
<LI> For Class A flats,  the supply to this lower end of the housing market was consistently dominated by the same developers, especially Developers C, D and J (<A HREF=#TBL3-4A>Table 4a</A>).  In 1994, these three developers accounted for over 50% of the overall market production in this class.  There appears to be a trend of increased concentration in production by these few developers in this housing sector. However, it is worth noting that Developers D and J were not the corporate giants which dominated the overall market. <A HREF=#FIG3-1A>Figure 1a</A> shows the cumulative market share of these eleven developers in the supply of Class A units.

<LI> For Class B flats, there was again a high concentration in production by a few developers (<A HREF=#TBL3-4B>Table 4b</A>).  Developer A was top of the rank in all four years. Developers B and D followed but their dominant market positions have been challenged by others in recent years. A closer look reveals that there has been no consistent pattern in terms of the collective market share of the top 3 players in the four year period. It fluctuated between 40-80% of the total (<A HREF=#FIG3-1B>Figure 1b</A>).  This was attributable to a number of factors, such as the production strategies of individual developers, economies of scale in production, lumpiness in flat supply, availability of appropriate sites for this housing class, and so on.

<LI> Class E flats refer to the top end of the housing market. Supply to this market sector was dominated by several top developers, except in 1994 (<A HREF=#TBL3-4E>Table 4e</A>). However, according to the findings below, the market concentration of the eleven developers in this housing class was comparatively low, except in 1994 (<A HREF=#FIG3-1E>Figure 1e</A>).

<LI><B>Market Concentration </B>- Summary of observations regarding market concentration in the production of new private housing in Hong Kong:
	<BR><BR>
	<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>There was a high concentration in terms of the production of new housing units by a few developers. Between 37% to 55% of the total annual supply in the market was provided by three developers. 

	<BR><BR>
	<LI>
One developer (Developer A) consistently produced the largest number of housing units and amount of residential floor space in the four year period. Generally speaking, these represented a market share of over 25% of the total annual supply. 

	<BR><BR>
	<LI>Two other developers (Developers B and C) were also dominant players in housing production. Although within the top five, their market share proportions tended to vary from year to year probably depending upon their building programmes and market strategies. Developer D was also a dominant supplier to the market.

	<BR><BR>
	<LI>Market concentration in the production of various flat sizes shows Developers A and B dominated the supply to Housing Classes B and C, both of which represented the mass housing units in the primary market. 

	<BR><BR>
	<LI>Developer A, the largest player overall, seemed to have focused largely on the production of mid range Class B and Class C type flats, but considerably reduced its market presence in Classes A, D and E. 

	<BR><BR>
	<LI>Developer C clearly dominated Class A flats and substantially reduced its presence in other housing markets.  On the other hand, Developer B dominated the up-market Class D and Class E type flats but also showed considerable presence in the supply of flats in Classes B and C.
	</UL>

<BR>
These are important features of the structure of the Hong Kong private sector housing market.

<P><I><OL TYPE=1 START=1><LI><A NAME="FN3-1"><A> MTRC was not included in the analysis because it produced no residential developments in the period.  We are aware that in the last 15 years, a total of 31,000 residential flats have been produced on MTRC sites, equal to one year's private housing production.  Due to developments above the airport railway, MTRC will be an important force in the market in the coming years. However, all its residential projects have been joint ventures with developers.  Of the projects which produced the 31,000 residential units, 9 out of 13 projects involved major developers (i.e. a developer with at least 5% market share).</OL></I>

<TITLE>HOW COMPETITIVE IS THE PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY MARKET ?</TITLE>
<H3>Annex 6 : Market Behaviour of Developers</H3>
<hr size=3 width=100%>
</HEAD>

<BODY>
<STRONG><U>Part A</U></STRONG>

<P><OL TYPE=1 START=1><LI> The HKPU has undertaken several case studies to examine the market behaviour of developers in the housing market. Specifically, they examined how and whether developers compete among themselves in the pricing and timing of their sales.

<P><LI>The HKPU has undertaken three case studies of eight residential developments by four developers over the period 1990 to mid-1995. These three case studies include housing sites in Tseung Kwan O, Ma On Shan and Lam Tin, respectively. The first two case study areas comprise potentially competing housing development undertaken by different developers. This will give good illustration of developers' behaviour in a competitive environment. The third case study area is intended to demonstrate the situation in which new housing supply is largely dominated by one single developer. The above three case studies involve land obtained by the developers through tenders and land exchange.
</OL>

<P><B><A HREF=TBL6-1_E.HTM> Case Study 1 - Tseung Kwan O </A></B>

<P><OL TYPE=1 START=3><LI> Two private residential developments were included in this case study. These housing sites are:
	<OL TYPE=a START=a>
	<LI> Well On Garden (Nan Fung)
	<LI> Finery Park (Henderson Land)
	</OL>

<P><LI> Both sites were acquired by the developers in 1991 through Letters A and B tenders. They are directly adjacent to each other. Both developments were planned to cater for the mass housing and were sold approximately at the same time. It is worthwhile to compare developers' behaviour in their sale prices and marketing strategies.

<P><LI><A HREF=TBL6-1_E.HTM> Table 1 </A> summarizes the sales programme of these two development in the open market. Both of them were offered to the market as uncompleted pre-sales flats in 1993, before banks contracted lending to those pre-sales units. Nan Fung's Well On Garden was the first private housing project in Tseung Kwan O, followed by Henderson's Finery Park.</OL>

<P><B>Pricing of Flats</B>

<P><OL TYPE=1 START=6><LI> Developers tended to set the sale prices of their flats based upon (i) the transaction price of comparable properties achieved in the secondary market, and (ii) the sale prices offered by its competitor.

<P><LI> Well On Garden was the first and foremost private housing development in the area and there was no secondary market at that time. What Nan Fung did was to undertake internal sale for Block 1 flats to test the market reaction at the beginning of March 1993 before the open market sale.  The HKPU has no information on how Nan Fung conducted its internal sale. However, they understand that the market reacted well with secondary sale price reaching $2,500 p.s.f within days. This became Nan Fung's reference in setting its open market sale prices. </OL>

<P><OL TYPE=1 START=8><LI> On 18 March 1993, all 320 flats in Block 3 were put to the market for sale. The average sale price was set at $2,784 p.s.f.  Market response was good and all flats were sold out. The sale prices of Block 3 flats subsequently rose to about $3,100 p.s.f in the secondary market.

<P><LI> Henderson clearly referenced the secondary market in setting its price offer. When 120 units of Block 1 were put to the open market on 30 May 1993, its average sale price was set at $3,170 p.s.f, which was 14% higher than the first sale price for Well On Garden. These 120 units were well over-subscribed. In response, the developer pushed out additional units to the market. Average sale price was then risen to 3,666 p.s.f. 

<P><LI> On 11 July 1993, Henderson launched a sale of 100 units of Block 2, Finery Park in two lots. Average prices were $3,666 p.s.f.  Market absorption was slow with only 60% sold eventually. It was in the midst of housing market downturn coupled with the imposition of Government's anti-speculation measures.

<P><LI> Nan Fung conducted its last open sale of Well On Garden in October 1993. A total of 338 flats were offered in two lots, with average prices at $3526 p.s.f. and $3534 p.s.f.</OL>

<P><B>Timing of Sale</B>


<P><OL TYPE=1 START=12><LI> There was no direct confrontation in timing of the two open market sale of these two developments. There was generally a time gap of some 2 to 3 months in-between their sale offers to the market and they tended to alternate each other in timing.

<P><LI> The investigation shows that Nan Fung and Henderson obtained from Government the consent to pre-sale of all the flats on 4 March 1993 and 11 May 1993, respectively. After obtaining the approval, they did clearly schedule the timing of their sales in phases. It is not clear whether they did co-ordinate their sales programmes or it was an outcome of their independent business strategy after considering their rival's action. This outcome gives both advantages and disadvantages.  The advantages are: Buyers with limited financial resources have the chance to put in bid for flats in both developments. In case of a very popular housing development, this arrangement will also avoid tying up too much finance capital and considerable interbank shift in liquidity in the banking sector within a short period of time. However, the disadvantages include: Lack of competition reduces consumer choices. As a result, buyers may have to face up with higher prices. In addition, this situation may also encourage entry of 'hot money' and speculation. </OL>
 
<P><B>Quantity of Sale</B>

<P><OL TYPE=1 START=14><LI> Both developers did not sell all the flats in the open market. Based on the available data from the Hong Kong Property Journal, only 658 (51%) out of 1,280 units in Well On Garden and 220 (32%) out of 688 units in Finery Park were put to public sales. The rest of the units were sold by the developers through internal sales or other means of allocation.

<P><LI> Internal sale of the flats is one means used by the developers to offload their inventory risks and to test the market response. Information on who actually bought these flats is not available. Obviously these buyers have the privilege over the general public. There were also re-sale of these internal sale flats to the secondary market. Block 1 flats of Well On Garden was sold to the market with its set sale prices plus a profit margin of $30,000 per flat.

<P><LI> All the public sales in these development were conducted through buyers' subscription and computer balloting. It is common practice for developers to divide the entire sale in several smaller lots and push additional units to the market after getting a favourable initial market response. Developers have the benefits in limiting the market supply at one time and therefore charging a potentially higher price.</OL>

<P>
<hr size=3 width=100%>
<P><B><A HREF=TBL6-2_E.HTM>Case Study 2 - Ma On Shan</A></B>

<P><OL TYPE=1 START=17><LI> Ma On Shan is a newly developed new town in the New Territories. Four major housing developments are considered: 
	<OL TYPE=a START=a>
	<LI> Sunshine City (Henderson Land) - Letter A and B Tender 
	<LI> Ma On Shan Centre (Nan Fung) - Letter A and B Tender 
	<LI> Bayshore Towers (Cheung Kong) - Cash Tender 
	<LI> Villa Athena (Joint venture development between Sun Hung Kai & YMCA) - Private Treaty </OL>

<P><LI> These developments have dominated the private new housing supply in Ma On Shan over the past three years. <A HREF=TBL6-2_E.HTM>Table 2</A> shows the consent dates, average offer prices, number of units offered and sold for the four developments.C</OL>

<P><B>Pricing of Flats</B>

<P><OL TYPE=1 START=19><LI> After obtaining the consent to sale on 6 April 1992, Henderson's Sunshine City was the first private residential development on sale in Ma On Shan.  Of the total 4,700 units, 240 of them were put on the market at an average price of $3,192 p.s.f. on 23 April 1992.  The market response was overwhelmingly good, with an over-subscription rate of 8.5 times, and all units were sold out.  Then, another lot of 240 units were put on the market in May 1992 at a slightly higher price of $3,311 p.s.f. and again, all were sold.  In March 1993, 232 units were put on the market at $3,203 p.s.f. but this time because of the quiet market condition, only 40% of them were reported to be have been sold.

<P><LI> Obtaining the consent to sell on 5 March 1993, units of Nan Fung's Ma On Shan Centre, with a total 1,048 units, were made available for sale starting from 7 April 1993.  280 units were put on the market and 70% of them were sold at an average price $3,104 p.s.f.   In August 1993, units of Sun Hung Kai's Villa Athena were also put on the market for sale.  494 units were offered on the market at $4,457 p.s.f. and 95% of them were sold out.  During the period of March - August 1993, units of both Henderson's Sunshine City and Nan Fung's Ma On Shan Centre were put on the market.  However, it was observed that the sales programmes of these units alternated with each other and sales prices were rising. In line with the upward market trend, prices of these developments reached their peak levels in March/April 1994.

<P><LI> The property market became cooling down after Government showed its intention to intervene in the overheated market in March 1994.  In May 1994, Henderson Land decided to reduce prices and successfully sold about 68 units at $5,048 p.s.f. to $5,354 p.s.f. in Sunshine City.  Nan Fung followed suit and reduced prices in Ma On Shan Centre to $4,710 p.s.f.  During the market downturn, Henderson decided to cut prices further to attrack potential purchasers.  Subsequently, about 168 units in Sunshine City were sold at $4,608 p.s.f. to $4,770 p.s.f. during August and September 1994. 

<P><LI> Cheung Kong's Bayshore Towers, which was the first development subject to Government's restrictions on re-sale of pre-sale flats, was the last development offered to the market in the locality.  In October 1994, the first batch of 422 units was sold at an average price of $4,400 p.s.f. rising gradually up to $5,100 p.s.f. for the last batch of additional units put to the market. The developer, Cheung Kong, successfully sold about 800 units (70% of the total 1,102 units in Bayshore Towers) in a relative quiet market condition. 

<P><LI> In this case study, when the market slumped, Henderson's Sunshine City, Nan Fung's Ma On Shan Centre and Cheung Kong's Bayshore Towers competed by lowering prices.  However, the prices were announced not at the same time but generally a week or more after each other.  Henderson's Sunshine City and Nan Fung's Ma On Shan Centre launched at roughly the same periods in 1993/94 and appeared to be close substitutes in the eyes of the consumers.  Cheung Kong's Bayshore Towers came late to the market but seemed to undercut Henderson in its sale prices.  For instance, the sale price of Bayshore Towers when first offered to the market in 12 October 1994 was $4,400 p.s.f. This was at a discount to Henderson's offer at $4,770 p.s.f. on 25 September 1994. Sun Hung Kai's Villa Athena did not seem to have followed the price trends of the other developments, probably because it was targeted for the upper end of the market, and most of its units were sold out in early 1994.
</OL>

<P><B>Timing of Sale</B>

<P><OL TYPE=1 START=24><LI> The HKPU has observed the phenomena that the developers alternated their sale programmes. The average time gap in-between their sale dates for the developments was about 20 days. There were some overlaps in promotion periods of the two housing developments, Sunshine City and Ma On Shan Centre, but their actual public sales did not overlap each other.

<P><LI> All developers in this case did get the sale consent from Government long before the actual public sale dates. They did plan long ahead in their property sales. </OL>

<P><B>Quanityt of Sale</B>

<P><OL TYPE=1 START=26><LI> Not all the flats were sold in the open market at a time. Developers also divided the sales in lots and released the units in small batches depending upon the prevailing market response.  Based on information from the Hong Kong Property Journal, about 45% in Sunshine City, 82% in Ma On Shan Centre, 72% in Bayshore Towers and 76% of Villa Athena were sold in the public sales at the time of analysis. All these units were sold through subscription and computer balloting.  The remaining portions were either being held by developers, internally sold or under construction.</OL>

<P>
<hr size=3 width=100%>

<P><B><A HREF=TBL6-3_E.HTM>Case study 3 - Lam Tin</A></B>

<P><OL TYPE=1 START=27><LI> Lam Tin comprises two new large housing developments - Laguna City and Sceneway Garden - developed by the same developer, Cheung Kong. The developer obtained the site together with some adjacent building lots and, through planning application and lease modification, developed it into a housing estate. Sceneway Garden is a housing development on MTR podium. </OL>

<P><B> Pricing of Flats </B>

<P><OL TYPE=1 START=28><LI> Flats were put to the open market for sale sixteen times during the period of 1990 to 1995 for Laguna City and four times during 1990-1991 for Sceneway Garden (<A HREF=TBL6-3_E.HTM>Table 3</A>). The pricing of the new flats closely followed the price level of the secondary market  - normally slightly below the second hand market level.</OL>


<P><B> Timing of Sale </B>

<P><OL TYPE=1 START=29><LI> Laguna City flats were put to the open market for sale in May 1990 for the first time. Since then, more flats were open for sale at time intervals of two, three or five months until June 1992 for 11 times. After that, no new flats were open for sale for a period of two years. Phase IV were open for sale in May 1994 (2 times), in September 1994, January 1995 and May 1995. Sceneway Garden flats were put out for sale for the first time in October 1990. Then more flats were put out for sale in November 1990 - less than 10 days between each sale. The fourth sale occurred about four months later in which all the remaining flats were sold at prices substantially higher than the previous sales. </OL>

<P><B> Quantity of Sale </B>

<P><OL TYPE=1 START=30><LI> The developer did not put all the flats to the market for sale at one time. Instead, only a certain percentage of the total supply were put to the market each time of sale.</OL>

<P><B>Market Competition</B>

<P><OL TYPE=1 START=31><LI> Laguna City and Sceneway Garden are the only large scale, estate-type housing development in Lam Tin. There was no evidence of keen competition as the two projects were developed by the same developer. The only source of competition came from the second hand Laguna City and Sceneway Garden flats. However, the owners in the secondary market also took the price set by the developer as a benchmark in determining their own asking prices.  This shows that the pricing of flats in both the new and secondary markets is interdependent on each other.</OL>

<H3>Annex 7 : Slippage of Flats Production in 1996</H3>
<hr size=3 width=100%>
</HEAD>

<BODY>
<OL TYPE=1 START=1><LI> In early 1996, the Government announced that the estimate of 27,272 housing units to be completed in 1996 was revised to 19,090 units, i.e., 30% lower than the original estimate.  The 1996 forecast is the lowest level in more than 16 years and 35% lower than the historical 16-year average. It is a particular cause for concern in terms of availability of supply.

<P><LI> Figures from the Government show that the main cause of this shortfall is the slippage of production of 9 projects involving 10,400 units by five major developers. These projects are due to be completed in 1996, and have been rescheduled until the beginning of 1997. 

<P><LI> The Consumer Council wrote to these five developers to find out the reasons for the slower than anticipated production rates.  Three developers of projects involving about 6,500 units have responded to our enquires.  Their responses are summarized below:</OL>

<H3>Annex 8 : Time Gap Between Consent Date and Actual Public Sale Date of Residential Developments</H3>
<hr size=3 width=100%>
</HEAD>

<BODY>
<OL Type=1 Start=1><LI> The Consumer Council has studied the time gap of developers put out their units for sale in the market after the issue of consent to sale. In the period January 1994 - April 1996 (i.e. 29 months), the Government issued consents for the presale of 57 residential developments involving 40,040 housing units.

<P><LI> We observed that the time gap between the time when the developers of the aforesaid residential developments received the consents to sale from the Government and the time when they put out their units for public sale was quite lengthy (Table 1).  Only 7% of the cases were put out for sale within a month of the granting of the consent.  On average, the time gap was about 120 days, and in five extreme cases, the time gap was over 540 days.  The long period between sale and consent may distort the effective supply in the residential property market.</OL>

<BODY>
<STRONG> Profits at project level </STRONG>
<OL TYPE=1 START=1>
<P><LI> A total of 13 residential developments by 9 developers were analysed by the HKPU. <A HREF=#TBL9-1>Table 1</A>  summarises the developers' profit margins at individual project level.

<P><LI> It is observed that the profit margins for developments on public auction land were generally lower than for developments on land obtained by tender.  It is probably due to the fact that land costs are normally lower if land were obtained through tenders, in particular through Letters A and B tenders. For those tendered sites, the estimated profit margins range from 77% to 364% of the total estimated development costs.  On the other hand, the estimated profit margins are in the region of 6% to 109% for lots obtained through public auction.

<P><LI> It also seems that whether a property developer can realise a profit from his development depends very much on his business foresight.  If land was acquired at a high price at the peak of the property market and sold during the recession, the developer would most probably suffer a substantial loss on his project.  On the other hand, if he bought land at a low price when the market was uncertain or moving up from the trough and sold his development in a buoyant market, he would probably realise a significant profit.   Most of this profit would be attributed to the increase in the value of land. 

<P><LI> To sum up, it is observed that:
	<BR><BR>
	<OL TYPE=a START=a>
	<LI> profit margins of development on land acquired by restrictive Letters A and B tenders tend to be greater than those from auctioned land.
	<LI> developers' profits are mainly attributed to the appreciation in land values.

<H2>CONSUMER COUNCIL FACT SHEET</h2>
<HR size=3>
</center>
<p>
The Consumer Council was established in April 1974 at a time of inflationary prices and widespread public concern about profiteering.  Although the main financial source of the Council is in the form of an annual Government subvention, the Council enjoys total independence in formulating and implementing its own policy.

<P><p>
<STRONG>I.	ORDINANCE</STRONG>
<p>The Consumer Council Ordinance 1977 came into force on 15.7.77 to provide for the incorporation of the Consumer Council and to protect Council Members and employees from personal liability for the bona fide acts and omissions of the Council and Committees.

<p><p><STRONG>V.	THE COUNCIL OFFICE AND STAFF</STRONG>
<p>	The Chief Executive (CE) heads the Consumer Council Office.  Underpinned by the Deputy Chief Executive, the CE is responsible for the implementation of the Council's decisions and assists in policy formulation.  The Consumer Council Office is divided into seven Divisions: Administration, Complaints and Advice, Information and Publication, Legal Affairs, Products Testing & Research, Survey and Trade Practices.  Most of the staff members work in the Head Office; the others are stationed at the 16 Consumer Advice Centres throughout the territory.

<P><BR>

<H2>Description of the pilot plant</H2>
<H3>Furnace</H3>
Both DC-arc furnaces consist of a refractory-lined cylindrical shell, a conical roof and a flat roof positioned on top of the conical roof.  The shell is lined with refractory bricks.  The hearth consists of a bottom layer of crushed refractory  and a top layer of ramming material.  The roofs are lined with an alumina castable refractory.  The furnace is equipped with water-spray cooling on the sidewalls and the roofs with water cooling jackets.
<P>
The two furnaces, the premelter and fuming furnace, can be connected via a launder and a underflow weir, for continuous transfer of hot slag. The fuming furnace can connected to the lead splash condenser via a refractory-lined duct.  The off-gas from the fuming furnace can also be re-routed directly to the combustion chamber via water-cooled ducting.  This is done for non-condensing testwork.  The off-gas ports for both furnaces are located in the conical roofs.

<H3>Electrodes</H3>
Graphite electrodes with an outer diameter of 200&nbsp;mm are used as cathodes on both furnaces.  The electrodes enter the furnaces through the central ports in the flat roofs.  These electrode ports consist of  refractory-lined electrode seals to ensure that there is no electrical contact between the electrodes and the roofs.  These seals also provide gas-tight seals around the electrodes.  The anodes consists of numerous steel bars, built into the hearth refractory and connected at their lower ends to steel plates.  The steel plates are connected, via radially extending arms, to the furnace shells and then to the anode cables.

<H3>Feed system</H3>
The feed system consists of several units:
<UL>
	<LI>the batching plant,
	<LI>two final feed hoppers to the fuming furnace,
	<LI>the premelter feed hopper, and
	<LI>a dust feeder.
</UL>
<P>
The batching plant comprises of eight storage bins (hoppers) varying in size from 0.1 to 1.5&nbsp;m&#179;, and eight dedicated horizontal belt feeders located under the bins.  The belt feeders deliver material to a common conveyor belt, which elevates and discharges the feed via a splitter  into either the premelter feeder or a surge hopper.
<P>
Feed material can be fed into the furnace through the centre of the electrode using a telescopic pipe or through the feed ports located in the flat or conical roof.  One or both the final feeders can be used to supply material to the furnace.  The final feeders only differ in capacity and feed rate capabilities.  The first can deliver feed material at a rate of up to 3.0&nbsp;t/h, and the second at a rate of up to 500&nbsp;kg/h.  Both feeders are equipped with surge bins, which deliver the feed material via pneumatically actuated slide valves (to provide gas seals).  Screw feeders are used to supply the material to the furnace.
<P>
The feeder to the premelter consists of a hopper supplied with feed material directly from the batching plant via the conveyor belt.  The feed material is supplied to the premelter, using a screw feeder, through the feed port in the flat roof.  The feeder can deliver material at a rate of up to 1.5&nbsp;t/h.
<P>
A dedicated dust feeder can also be used to supply the furnace with material either through the centre of the electrode or through the feed ports in the roof.  This feeder is especially designed to handle fine feed materials (dust).  It consists of a 1.5&nbsp;m&#179; hopper with a bin activator attached to the lower portion of the conical section.  The bin activator is essentially a vibrating cone suspended across the mouth of the hopper by means of hanger links with rubber anti-vibration mountings.  An externally mounted motor vibrates the material being handled via the internal cone.  A flexible rubber sleeve isolates the screw feeder from the bin activator, and prevents material from escaping.  A vibrator is attached the screw feeder to minimize bridging of material between the screw feeder and the hopper.  A rotary valve is connected between the screw feeder and the feed pipe in order to provide a gas seal.

<H3>ISP lead splash condenser</H3>
The leadsplash condenser is a smaller version of the ISP condensers that are employed, at several plants world-wide, in combination with an Imperial Smelting Furnace (ISF) for the smelting of mixed zinc and lead sinter.  The condenser assembly consists of the condenser body with a single rotor, the lead circulation pump, the cooling launder with immersible cooling pins, and the zinc separation bath.  The condenser body is basically a steel box, about 2&nbsp;m wide, 4&nbsp;m long and 2&nbsp;m high, lined with refractory bricks.  A variable-speed rotor is inserted through the cast refractory roof.  The whole assembly occupies a space of approximately 5&nbsp;m by 5&nbsp;m  The condenser contains 21&nbsp;t (metric ton, 1000&nbsp;kg) of lead, and is designed for a maximum zinc condensing rate of 350&nbsp;kg/h.
<P>

<BR CLEAR=left>
<I>Schematic presentation of the lead splash condenser</I>
<P>

<H3>Power supply</H3>
The 5.6&nbsp;MVA power supply consists of two transformers and two rectifiers, so that the facility can be operated with a single furnace at a maximum of 10&nbsp;kA, or with two furnaces at 5&nbsp;kA per furnace.

<H3>Control and data acquisition</H3>
The DC-arc furnaces are fully controlled using a PC-based SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) system, which provides a console for the configuration of operating parameters, recipe management, alarm annunciation, and data logging.  Manual or semi-automatic operation is also available.

<H3>Gas handling</H3>
The off-gas system behind the condenser comprises a refractory-lined combustion chamber, water-cooled ducting, a 'trombone' gas cooler, a reverse-pulse bagfilter, a fan and a stack.  The designed gas flowrate of the bagfilter is 25&nbsp;000&nbsp;Nm&#179;/h.  A second bagfilter with a fan capacity of 6&nbsp;500&nbsp;Nm&#179;/h is connected to the premelter.

<H3>Feed system</H3>
The feed system consists of six holding bins, each connected to
a feed hopper. The hoppers vary in size and feed rate capabilities
to ensure that accurate feed rates can be attained at high and
low rates. Each of the feed hoppers rests on three load cells
and has a chute connected to a variable vibrator, which is regulated
via the dedicated feed controller. The feed from each hopper is
conveyed along a main vibratory chute which directs the feed to
a port located in the roof and/or a hollow electrode (for centre feeding).

rated at 6&nbsp;500&nbsp;Nm&#179;/h. The off-gas is extracted
from the furnace through the gas extraction port situated in the
furnace roof. The bagplant utilizes 100 polyester needlefelt bags
with a total area of 100&nbsp;m&#178;. The fume released from
the bags settle into a cone, from where it is continuously discharged
through a rotary valve into drums. <BR>

<H2>Description of the pilot plant</H2>
<H3>Furnace</H3>
The furnace shell is lined with refractory bricks suitable for the testwork being done.  The hearth is usually  lined with high-magnesite rammable material.  The roof of the furnace is lined with alumina castable refractory.  The furnace shell is further equipped with water-spray cooling.

<H3>Electrode</H3>
The three 100&nbsp;mm graphite electrodes enter the furnace through three symmetrically positioned ports.  The feed enters the furnace through a feed port positioned between the two electrode ports in the front.

<H3>Feed system</H3>
The feed system consists of six 0.9&nbsp;m&#179; batching hoppers fitted with vibratory feeders.  The vibratory feeders discharge the feed material onto a belt conveyor, from where it is fed into the furnace supply feed hopper.

<H3>Power supply</H3>
The power supply is a three-phase unit fed by a 11&nbsp;kV, 50&nbsp;Hz supply.  One unit of the transformer is an auto-regulator with on-load tap changer and a reactor with a manually operated off-circuit tap switch.  The second unit is a tapless main transformer with a ratio of 73:3 and double-wound secondary winding.

<H3>Gas handling</H3>
The off-gases are extracted by a reversed pulse bagplant rated at 6&nbsp;500&nbsp;Nm&#179;/h.  The bagplant utilizes 100 polyester needlefelt bags with a total area of 100&nbsp;m&#178;.  The fume released from the bags settle into a cone, from where it is continuously discharged through a rotary valve into drums.

<IMG ALIGN=left,center SRC="BlueDot.gif"><B><I>Vessel, frame, hydraulic cylinders and variable speed geared motor </B></I><BR>
The vessel consists of a mild-steel flanged cylinder with a length of 585&nbsp;mm and a diameter of 600&nbsp;mm.  A mild-steel cone tapering from 600&nbsp;mm to 430&nbsp;mm is bolted onto the top flange.  A mild-steel base-plate with a diameter of 600&nbsp;mm is bolted to the base flange of the vessel.
<P>
The drive shaft is bolted to the base-plate, and located by a plumber block bolted to the furnace support frame at an angle of 30 to the horizontal.  This frame is supported by the upright cradle arms.
<P>
The vessel is lined with 500&nbsp;kg of chrome-magnesite castable.  The wall thickness of the refractory at the base of the vessel is 150&nbsp;mm, and at the sides, 138&nbsp;mm.
<P>
A 25-teeth sprocket is bolted to the drive shaft, and a 25,4&nbsp;mm pitch single chain connects it to a 17-teeth sprocket, which forms part of the variable speed geared motor.  The motor has an output of 0.37&nbsp;kW, and can rotate the vessel at a minimum of 2&nbsp;r/min and at a maximum of 11&nbsp;rmin.
<P>
The vessel is tilted by two hydraulic pistons fastened to the vessel's frame at one end and the mainframe at the other.  When the hydraulics are activated, the arms lift the frame upwards allowing the vessel's contents  to pour into a ladle.
<P>
<BR>
<IMG ALIGN=left,center SRC="BlueDot.gif"><B><I>Lance</B></I><BR>

The lance has a power rating of 120&nbsp;kW maximum and turn down to 20&nbsp;kW.  It is 1.2&nbsp;m long, and consists of four concentric stainless-steel pipes with diameters of 10, 20, 30 and 50&nbsp;mm.
<P>
The 10&nbsp;mm pipe carries the propane while the annulus surrounding it, formed by the 20&nbsp;mm pipe, carries the oxygen.  Because the oxygen flows through an open annulus, only low line pressure is required.  The 20, 30 and 50&nbsp;mm diameter pipes form the jacket, with the inlet water flowing through the 30&nbsp;mm inner pipe and out through the 50&nbsp;mm pipe.

<H1 ALIGN=center>Pyrosim Software</H1>
Pyrosim is a general-purpose computer program for the steady-state simulation of pyrometallurgical processes.  One of the primary strengths of the program is its built-in capability to calculate multi-component multi-phase equilibria, along with the automatic performance of energy-balance calculations.  This predictive ability allows the program to simulate novel processes rather accurately.  An empirical modelling capability also allows the program to match known parameters of existing processes.
<P>
The program was originally developed in 1985, with the purpose of simulating processes for the production of raw stainless steel.  However, the program's structure was kept very general to allow other processes to be simulated.  The program has been successfully applied to the processing of ferroalloys, metal carbides, base metals, precious metals, and refractory metals.  The program has also been used for the study of various pyrometallurgical pretreatment options, such as preheating and prereduction, as well as processes involving combustion.  Pyrosim has also recently been used successfully to model the plasma-arc treatment of waste materials such as lead blast-furnace slag and electric-arc furnace dust, processes inherently complex because of the number of chemical elements involved.
<P>
Processes involving furnaces, fluidized beds, and rotary kilns have been modelled by Pyrosim.  The program provides process models to describe heating, chemical equilibrium, and multi-stage equilibrium with staged removal of a product stream.  Bypass streams, entrainment of metal in slag (for example), and simple recycle loops are easily handled.  Energy-controlled calculations (where the final process temperature has to be calculated) can also be performed for all models.  Where appropriate, some of the models also provide a significant quantity of derived information, such as the liquidus temperature, viscosity, and basicity of slags, as well as gas ratios and degrees of reduction.
<P>
A recent addition to Pyrosim is a general empirical model (Pyrobal), which complements the existing predictive models.  There are times when the user may wish to use certain known facts about the process being modelled, in preference to the information provided by the predictive models.  The remaining process variables are then calculated from a set of simultaneous linear equations, and an energy balance can then be carried out.  The specifications allowed by the program are of two types: namely ratios between pairs of species or percentages of species in a particular stream.  A value can be specified for the mass ratio or molar ratio of any species in any stream to any other species in any other stream.  For example, the molar ratio between CO and CO<SUB>2</SUB> in the gas can be specified, as can the mass ratio between S in the slag and S in the metal, or the mass ratio between TiO<SUB>2</SUB> in the slag and Ti in the metal.  Alternatively, the user can specify the mass percentage of any species in any stream.  For example, the content of C in the metal can be specified as having a particular value.  Streams containing only one element, such as solid carbon, for example, are also easily accommodated using this model.
<P>
A utility program called Pyromake is supplied with the software, to allow the user to construct a simulation disk (or directory) containing only the chemical species of interest.  By means of a simple selection from a list of species on the screen, a database containing all the relevant thermodynamic data is automatically constructed.  This simple-to-use utility program allows the user to set up a stand-alone Pyrosim system containing all chemical species of interest.  The built-in process models can then be used on the systems of your choice.  Energy balance calculations are also performed automatically.
<P>
The latest version of the program (v1.56) supports large systems (typically up to 100 feed materials, 100 species in the system, 60 species per equilibrium phase, and 30 elements).  Features recently added to the program are the automatic calculation of elemental analyses of all product streams (also showing slags in terms of the simple oxides) and the provision of a table showing the distribution of elements between phases.
<P>
<I>Availability</I><BR>
The Pyrosim program runs on personal computers using the MS-DOS operating system.  There are no special hardware requirements needed to run the program, although 640&nbsp;kb of memory and a math coprocessor are recommended.  Version 1.56 of Pyrosim is available at a price of R7500 or US&nbsp;$2500 (valid until 31 December 1996).  The software is distributed on a single diskette, and is available from the Pyrometallurgy Division, Mintek.

<B>Synopsis:</B>  Pyrosim is a general-purpose computer program for the steady-state simulation of pyrometallurgical processes.  The program uses a variety of models to predict the flowrates and analyses of product streams, as well as the distribution of elements between phases.  One of the primary strengths of the program is its built-in capability to calculate multi-component multi-phase equilibria, along with the automatic performance of energy-balance calculations.  This predictive ability allows the program to simulate novel processes rather accurately.  Pyrosim provides a convenient framework for the calculation of material and energy balances, as well as a simple basis for cost comparisons between process options.
<HR>

<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
Pyrometallurgical operations are essentially concerned with the high-temperature processing of materials.  These processes can be extremely complex, involving reactions between gas, solids, liquid slag, and liquid metal (and sometimes other phases as well).
<P>
Pyrometallurgical processes must be evaluated at many stages during their development and design, and when operating changes are introduced.  Because experimental work in pyrometallurgy is expensive, a system should be characterised as thoroughly as possible before experimental work is undertaken.  Computer simulation allows the requirements of a particular process to be determined quickly and reliably.
<P>
The essential problem of process simulation involves the development of a technique that will allow the prediction of the outcome of a particular process under specified operating conditions.  To this end, a computer program, Pyrosim, was developed by the author to calculate predictive steady-state mass and energy balances for a wide variety of processes.  Since many different raw materials must be taken into account, the program is very flexible in this regard.
<P>
Pyrosim was originally developed as a program to simulate processes used in the production of raw stainless steel.  The initial development work started in 1985 on an Apple II computer equipped with 64&nbsp;kb of memory.  Fortunately, the program's structure was kept very general to allow other processes to be simulated.
<P>
The program was first presented in public (outside of Mintek) at the APCOM&nbsp;87 conference [1] (The 20th International Symposium on the Application of Computers and Mathematics in the Mineral Industries) in October 1987.  The first version of the program to be used in industry (v1.0 for IBM-compatible personal computers) was released at the end of 1988.  A dissertation [2] based on Pyrosim was submitted for an MSc(Eng) degree at the University of the Witwatersrand during 1989.
<P>
Pyrosim software runs on personal computers using the MS-DOS operating system.  There are no special hardware requirements needed to run the program, although 640&nbsp;kb of memory and a math coprocessor are recommended.  Obviously, from the point of view of speed, an i386 or higher processor will be most suitable for intensive calculational work.
<P>
A typical simulation using the present version of the program (v1.2) may take just over three seconds on a 33&nbsp;MHz i486 computer, whereas the same simulation would have taken over an hour on an Apple&nbsp;II.  This represents a speeding up by a factor of 1200.
<P>
The program has been successfully applied to the processing of ferroalloys, metal carbides, base metals, and refractory metals.  The program has also been used for the study of various pyrometallurgical pretreatment options, such as preheating and prereduction, as well as processes involving combustion.  Pyrosim has also recently been used successfully to model the plasma-arc treatment of electric-arc furnace dust, a process inherently complex because of the number of chemical elements involved.

<H2>PROCESS SIMULATOR</H2>

The simulator is based on the description of the process units and streams involved in a flowsheet.  The state of any stream is completely specified by the vector of flowrates of each chemical species together with the temperature and pressure.  A complete specification of the the section of plant being simulated can be obtained by including the operating conditions of each process unit.  These conditions include the operating temperature, pressure, and the energy losses from the unit.  (Additionally, the differences between the temperatures of individual product streams and the nominal process temperature may also be specified.)  It is also necessary to specify whether the process is temperature-controlled or energy-controlled.
<P>
Any process unit has a number of feed streams, each at its own particular temperature.  From the chemical analysis of the feed streams, the number of moles of each chemical species is calculated.  It is often necessary to treat minerals as ideal mixtures of chemical compounds, since thermodynamic data is not readily available for minerals as such.
<P>
The appropriate thermodynamic constants (the standard enthalpy and entropy of formation, and CP coefficients) are then assigned (from the built-in database) to each of the chemical species so that the partial molal enthalpy of each component can be calculated at the stream temperature.  In general, the partial molal enthalpy is a function of temperature, pressure, and composition.  The effect of composition on the enthalpies of individual components is small in most cases; there is also very little data available on the variation in enthalpy with composition.  The effects of composition on enthalpy are therefore ignored, which is equivalent to the treatment of the process streams as ideal solutions (for the purposes of the energy balance).  Except for gases at high pressure, the dependence of enthalpy on pressure is small.  (If deemed important, the effect could be allowed for by the use of equations of state or reduced property correlations, outside of the program.)  In this field of interest, the enthalpy is assumed to depend solely on temperature.  The enthalpy of each pure species is calculated relative to the elements in their standard state at 25&#176;C and 1&nbsp;atm.  The total enthalpy of a stream is taken to be equal to the sum of the enthalpies of all the species in the stream.
<P>
The total number of moles of each of the chemical species entering a particular unit is then placed in a vector of feed species.  In this way, an indefinite number of feed streams (limited, of course, by available memory) containing material of any composition and at any temperature can be accommodated.  The unit model is then applied to the feed vector.  The model is essentially a mapping of the elements in the chemical species of the feed vector onto vectors of the species in the resulting product streams (e.g. gas, solids, slag, and metal).  The total enthalpy of these resulting streams is then calculated as described above.
<P>
The energy requirement of a process is calculated as the difference between the enthalpy of the products and that of the feed streams.  The specified losses of energy from the process unit are then added to this amount to give the energy requirement of the process unit.  In this way, the enthalpy calculation can be performed independently of any specific reaction path.
<P>
Some or all of the products (e.g. gas, solids, slag, and metal) from the first unit may then become part of the feed to the next unit.  The fraction of each of the product streams entering the next unit can be independently specified.
<P>
The present version of Pyrosim supports the saving of analyses of product streams, to simplify the solution of recycle loops.  For most pyrometallurgical flowsheets, one of the streams within a recycle loop can usually be estimated.  In this way, the loop is 'torn' open, and the calculations can be continued as explained previously.  Some form of iteration (direct substitution is usually adequate) is then applied to the calculation of the 'tear' stream until convergence is attained.  The topology of most pyrometallurgical flowsheets is fairly simple, and this approach is therefore usually adequate.
<P>
The Pyrosim program achieves its generality by obtaining all the required information from a number of data files.  These files cover the names of the process units, the thermodynamic data and stoichiometry of the chemical species under consideration, the chemical analyses of the feed materials, the unit costs of raw materials and electrical energy, and the specifications of the chemical species present in each phase at equilibrium.  All these files are managed by the program, and data can be added, deleted, edited, or listed.  Thus, the program is kept independent of any particular process route.
<P>
A sample printout from the program is presented in the Appendix.  This shows all of the sections of the printed report, namely the Flowsheet, Flowrates, Operation, Energy, Analyses (in mass&nbsp;%, with gas analyses shown in mol&nbsp;% as well), Elemental Analyses, Distribution of Elements, and Material and Energy Costs sections, each of which may be printed individually if desired.

<H2>THERMODYNAMIC DATA</H2>

Because the program relies heavily on thermodynamic data for its predictions and for the energy calculations, it is imperative to use the best available data.  For all chemical species of interest, therefore, data has been obtained from the F*A*C*T [3] thermodynamic database in Canada, as well as from other sources where necessary.  A small sample of the data used by the program is shown in Table 1.

Pyrosim determines which of the phase regions to use to obtain the coefficients in the calculations, according to the temperature range in which the system temperature falls.  If the temperature is beyond the highest temperature for which data is available, the values are extrapolated using the functional form of the closest set of data.  If it is necessary to override the automatic selection of the appropriate phase region, the temperature ranges can be 'adjusted' so as to force the desired phase region to be selected.  However, a better method is to create a separate entry for each phase region using the data pertaining to that region only.  For example, instead of using the species Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>, one could create two separate entries for Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>(s) and Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>(l) using only the relevant set of data in each case.

<H2>PROCESS MODELS</H2>

The models of individual process units that are to be included in the program all have a standard form, since the output from a unit must be calculated from the input to that unit and the specified operating conditions.  The following features need to be borne in mind when a model for a process is set up.
<P>
It is assumed that the amount, composition, and temperature of the feed materials entering the unit are known.  The operating pressure and the energy losses are also known.  The temperature is specified for process units where an external energy source is present.  Otherwise, the process is said to be energy-controlled and the temperature is determined by the model.  The temperature is rapidly calculated, by trial and error, to be such that the difference between the enthalpy of the products and that of the feed is equal to the loss of energy from the unit.  (Note that an adiabatic process is the special case of an energy-controlled process where the energy loss is equal to zero.)  Energy-controlled calculations can be performed for all process models within Pyrosim.
<P>
The model must simulate real operation as closely as possible.  The user is required to specify only what he is free to specify in practice.  For example, one can specify the ratio of the materials in the feed but not the composition of the metal.  The amounts and compositions of the product streams are calculated from the feed materials and the operating conditions.  Any additional parameters of interest can also be calculated at this stage.  For example, it is useful to report the calculated liquidus temperature of the slag for an electric-arc furnace model.
<P>
No process model should be regarded as being absolutely definitive.  Through a process of interaction with the users of the program, there will hopefully be a steady evolution of improved process models.
<P>
Models may be empirical, specific, general, kinetic, or based on equilibrium.  Of course, the ideal for every simulation is to be able to predict the outcome of any process.  For this reason, much effort was expended to provide a technique for the prediction of the distribution of the elements between the various chemical species in the product streams.  The models that are most generally applicable are those based on a fundamentally sound description of the process being simulated.  A technique has been made available that will provide a model based on the description of the chemical equilibrium of a multi-phase system.

<H3>Non-Equilibrium Models</H3>

Pyrosim contains a simple Heater/Drier model which simply separates the feed streams into a gas stream and a solids stream.  The two product streams are normally at a higher temperature than the feed materials, and the model calculates the energy required to raise the temperature of the materials (and perhaps to vaporise any moisture that may be present).  The criterion for deciding whether a particular species goes to the gas stream or the solids stream is whether or not the stable phase of that species is gaseous at the process temperature.  The degree of moisture removal and devolatilisation may also be specified by the user of the program.
<P>
An example of an empirical model, described fully elsewhere [2], is one developed for a rotary kiln, where a number of empirical factors are specified, as shown in Figure 1, and the remaining variables calculated from these.

<H3>Equilibrium Models</H3>

Pyrometallurgical processes take place at high temperatures.  For this reason, the attainment of equilibrium in many processes is not prevented by kinetic limitations.  However, a general method for the prediction of the composition of an isothermal multi-phase system at equilibrium is required.
<P>
Problems relating to the chemical equilibrium of a system involving several chemical species are notoriously intractable, requiring the solution of many simultaneous non-linear equations.  However, such problems can be reduced to the minimization of the Gibbs free energy of the system, which is the fundamental description of chemical equilibrium.  In general, there is an infinite number of ways in which non-negative mole numbers can be assigned to the possible product species such that the chemical reactions involving the specified reactants will be balanced.  At a specified temperature and pressure, the most stable products (the desired solution to the problem) are those associated with the lowest free energy.
<P>
This minimization problem has the free energy of the system as the objective function, and the number of moles of each of the chemical species in each phase as the variables.  The constraints that apply are those of mass conservation for each element present in the system, as well as those of non-negativity of the number of moles of each species present.  The equality constraints can be taken care of by the use of the technique of undetermined Lagrange multipliers.  Eriksson [4] has devised a method for free-energy minimization which uses a truncated Taylor series expansion of the non-linear equations around successive estimates of the solution to provide a system of linear equations to be solved within each iteration.  Pyrosim provides a starting estimate (which can be arbitrary) of the number of moles of each of the chemical species present in each phase.  The number of equations to be solved is equal to the number of elements plus the number of phases.  A number of possible compounds may therefore be included in the description of the equilibrium system, since the program will be able to show which species will not form to any appreciable extent.
<P>
The linear equations that must be solved in each iteration are often somewhat ill-conditioned, i.e. they form a matrix with a very small determinant.  These systems can still be solved accurately using only single-precision arithmetic, if the matrix is first scaled before being solved by Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting.
<P>
A number of corrections are applied to the calculations to ensure that all the solutions will be positive and to eliminate species that are present only in negligible quantities, since their inclusion would unduly slow down convergence of the system of equations.
<P>
Figure 2 shows a typical intermediate display during an equilibrium calculation.  Note that the current estimate of the number of moles of each species in each phase (gas, slag, and metal, in this case) is displayed on the screen, along with some other information.
<P>

<P>
<P>
Convergence of the equilibrium calculations is monitored by means of 'convergence factors' for each phase, which are calculated after each iteration.  For each phase, the factor is the ratio of (the total number of moles in the phase in the present iteration) divided by (the total number of moles in the phase in the previous iteration) minus one.  These factors approach zero as the system converges.  The convergence criterion is set so that all convergence factors must have an absolute value of less than 10^-5.  These factors are sometimes useful indicators of possible reasons for non-convergence, in that if a particular factor remains large it usually means that the corresponding phase is probably unstable.  The way to correct this problem is to redo the equilibrium specification, leaving out the unstable phase.
<P>
Also shown on the screen, is the number omega!, which is explained in detail elsewhere [2].  While omega! is less than one, the uncorrected estimated number of moles of at least one of the species is negative.  omega! is the fraction by which the estimated number of moles of each of the species has to be corrected in order for all estimates to be made positive.  Note that omega! must be equal to one before convergence can occur.  (If a pure condensed phase is specified as being present at equilibrium, but in fact proves to be unstable, the estimated number of moles for that species will be zero and so will omega!.  In this case, the equilibrium specification should be redone, leaving out the unstable pure phase.  In a later version of the program, this will hopefully be taken care of automatically.)
<P>
The usual reasons for non-convergence are:
1)  disappearance of one of the phases.
2)  inclusion of an extremely unstable species in one of the mixed phases.  (This shows up by the estimated number of moles of the species rapidly disappearing to zero within the first few iterations.)
3)  violation of the phase rule, by including too many pure condensed phases.
<P>
However, most problems converge to a solution rather easily.  A typical problem might require about a dozen iterations to solve the system of equations to an accuracy of more than five decimal places.
<P>
The technique has been applied to a wide variety of systems and has been found to be extremely reliable and stable over a wide range of conditions.
<P>
Probably the most severe limitation of a simple equilibrium model is the fact that real process units are not actually isothermal.  For example, conditions vary within furnaces; the temperature is lower further from the arc, and the pressure is higher the deeper the position within the liquid layer.  The most useful application of this technique has been to the simulation of electric-arc furnaces where, as a fairly good approximation, it can be said that the temperature (and pressure) of the tapped products are approximately uniform.  Here the assumption of isothermal equilibrium is reasonably accurate.

<H3>Specification of Equilibria</H3>

The specification of the chemical species present at equilibrium is very simple.  A list of all species of interest is displayed by the program, and the user then indicates which species might be expected to be present in each phase at equilibrium.  Once the list of species has been specified, the matrix of equations is automatically set up by the program.  Large systems (e.g. 100 feed materials, 100 species in the system, 60 species per equilibrium phase, 30 elements) are handled routinely by Pyrosim.  The limits on the number of feed materials, species in the system, species per equilibrium phase, and number of elements in any given equilibrium calculation can now be tailored to any particular requirements, simply by editing a simple configuration file.

The reactions taking place in such a system are extremely complex, and the solution of the resultant equilibria is virtually impossible without the use of a computer program using the technique of free-energy minimization.


<H3>Activity Calculations</H3>

In equilibrium calculations, it is assumed that the activity of each species in the specified system can be calculated from the chemical composition of each phase.  The activity of a component in a solution is defined as the ratio of its fugacity to its standard-state fugacity.  The activity function can, at least in theory, be calculated from the equation of state of the solution.  However, because of the low accuracy of liquid-phase equations of state in general, other techniques are required for the calculation of activities in slag and metal solutions.  Unfortunately, accurate activity data for components in slags and metals is limited.  For example, data is often available for simple slag systems, but not for the more complex slags encountered in actual practice.
<P>
The ideal-solution model, in which the activity of each component equals its mole fraction, is the simplest model of activities in a solution.  This model takes into account only the effect of dilution on activities, and ignores the chemical and physical effects of mixing.  Although very few metal solutions and even fewer oxide systems display 'ideal' behaviour, this is chosen as the reference for solution behaviour.
<P>
It is usually expedient to assume that the gas phase behaves ideally, as this is a reasonably accurate assumption under the conditions most frequently encountered (namely low pressure and high temperature).
<P>
Slags are relatively concentrated solutions of oxides, and usually contain oxides such as SiO2, CaO, MgO, and Al2O3, together with the oxides of the metals involved in the process.  They are complex solutions in which each component influences the activity of the others, and hence their behaviour is not easily described.  Some authors have derived solution models for slags based on the ideal or regular constitutional models, using various species as components.  Others have adopted a structural approach, modelling the slag properties in terms of some hypothetical structure.  It is now generally accepted that slags are essentially ionic systems, although they have on occasion been viewed as having a molecular structure, with the molecules envisaged as combining to form more complex (and unreactive) molecular structures, for example, 2CaO.SiO2, which exist in dissociated equilibrium with the corresponding components.
<P>
Metallic systems comprising dilute solutions can often be modelled using activity coefficients at infinite dilution, and interaction coefficients.  However, a solution model that can satisfactorily deal with non-dilute metallic solutions is required.

<H3>Ideal Mixing of Complex Components</H3>

A major improvement on the ideal-mixing model is the use of the Ideal Mixing of Complex Components [5] approach, as proposed by Hastie and Bonnell [6,7,8].  This generally allows good estimates for the equilibrium products to be generated, by including a list of possible intermediate compounds in the equilibrium specification, to model some of the chemical interactions between species.  This model attributes deviations from ideal-solution behaviour to the formation of complex component liquids and solid phases.  Although this solution model may be fictitious, it is useful for the derivation of expressions for the dependence of thermodynamic quantities on composition.  The derived expressions are helpful in the extrapolation of data to other composition ranges, and in the estimation of the thermodynamic properties of related systems.
<P>
The terminology used in this section requires definition.  The term 'components' refers to the usual reference-state oxides, such as SiO<SUB>2</SUB>, CaO, MgO, and Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB> in slag systems, and to the elements, such as Fe and Si, in metallic solutions.  'Complex components' refers to compounds (liquid or solid) of the simple components, such as 2MgO.SiO<SUB>2</SUB> in a slag, or Fe<SUB>3</SUB>Si in a metal.
<P>
The model is based on the identification of complex components (such as alkali silicates) in solution.  These complex components account for the non-ideal solution interactions.  These complex components, together with the non-complexed constituent components, are explicitly included in a multi-component equilibrium calculation to determine the equilibrium distribution of each component in any phase, with the calculations being constrained to obey the Gibbs-Duhem activity and Gibbs phase-rule relationships.  The activities are taken to be equal to the equilibrium mole fractions of the uncomplexed components.
<P>
The key assumption of the present model is that complex solution phases can be approximated as mixtures of known, or hypothetical, liquids based on melts of established complex solids.  The liquid components are not independent molecular or ionic species, but are essentially sub-phases that serve as models for the local associative order.  Therefore, the complex thermodynamic interactions that occur between components are essentially contained in the Gibbs free energies for the complex components.  A typical multi-component oxide system can then be represented as an ideal mixture (or any other physical model) of many such component liquids and solids.
<P>
The use of molecular formulae in this model does not imply the actual presence of molecular species.  The model deals only with liquids or solids as components of the mixture, and not with molecular or ionic species as is often the case with other solution models.  For the most part, the component liquids are established neutral, stable, thermodynamic compounds, appearing in phase diagrams in equilibrium with congruently melting solids, and also in reference tables of thermodynamic functions.  The free energies of formation are either known or can be estimated for these complex component liquids (and solids).
<P>
In the IMCC model, it is implicit that the physical interactions (i.e. those not attributed to chemical bonding) among the complex components are considered negligible compared to the strong chemical interactions leading to their formation.  It is noteworthy that this is the case for many metal-oxygen and metal-sulphur systems, as well as oxide ceramic mixtures and certain alloy systems, that are influenced primarily by the chemical interaction caused by the formation of associated species and secondarily by the physical interactions among all the species.
<P>
One of the prime benefits of this predictive model is that it is equally capable of handling systems containing few or many components.  The fact that this model can therefore be applied to systems where essentially no phase-stability information is available, represents a significant improvement in the prediction of activity relations for complex systems.
<P>
The IMCC approach has been used previously [5] to model simple industrial slags.  Calculated activities in the CaO-MgO-SiO<SUB>2</SUB> ternary system were compared with the experimentally-determined data of Rein and Chipman [9].  For the calculations, all possible species and phases for which thermodynamic data is available were considered as possible candidates for formation at equilibrium.  The species considered were CaO, MgO, SiO<SUB>2</SUB>, CaO.MgO, CaO.SiO<SUB>2</SUB>, 2CaO.SiO<SUB>2</SUB>, 3CaO.SiO<SUB>2</SUB>, 3CaO.2SiO<SUB>2</SUB>, MgO.SiO<SUB>2</SUB>, 2MgO.SiO<SUB>2</SUB>, CaO.MgO.SiO<SUB>2</SUB>, CaO.MgO.2SiO<SUB>2</SUB>, 2CaO.MgO.2SiO<SUB>2</SUB>, and 3CaO.MgO.2SiO<SUB>2</SUB>.
<P>
Figure 3 shows the activity -- mole-fraction relationship for MgO in the CaO-MgO-SiO<SUB>2</SUB> ternary system at a constant level of 30&nbsp;mole&nbsp;%&nbsp;CaO.  So that a comparison can be made with the experimental data, the figure pertains to that portion of the phase diagram where only a liquid is present, although the model is able to deal with the presence of solids as well.  The composition boundaries are indicated on the diagram.  From the figure, a comparison can be made between the calculated activities, the experimentally determined activities, and the ideal activities.

<P>
<P>
There is excellent agreement between the calculated and experimentally determined activities of CaO and MgO, and reasonably good agreement between the activity curves for SiO<SUB>2</SUB>.  It is also important to note the large discrepancies that would result if the assumption of an ideal solution was made.
<P>
The Ideal Mixing of Complex Components (IMCC) solution model has been shown to be applicable to the prediction of activities in complex solutions where chemical interactions are dominant over physical interactions.  Such systems are often encountered in pyrometallurgical systems.  This solution model works well and is easy to use in equilibrium calculations.
<P>
Work is currently in progress to provide more support for a variety of methods for the calculation of activity coefficients in specific systems.  There is some good data available on the slag system SiO2-CaO-MgO-Al2O3-FeO-Fe2O3-MnO, for example.

<H2>STAINLESS STEEL SYSTEM</H2>

As Pyrosim had its beginnings in the attempt to model processes leading up to the production of raw stainless steel, models have been developed for a number of process units and process steps in the 'Stainless Steel' (`SS') system.  The models include a drier, gas drier, fluidized bed, electrothermal fluidized bed, rotary kiln, two-zone kiln, electric-arc furnace, coal-oxygen injection furnace, and an empirical furnace model.  The details of these models are published elsewhere [2].  Some of these models also provide a significant quantity of derived information, such as the liquidus temperature, viscosity, and basicity of slags, as well as gas ratios and degrees of reduction.
<P>
The 'SS' system is supplied as a full working simulation system which shows the flexibility of the program in incorporating both empirical and predictive process models.  The 'SS' system includes pre-defined equilibrium specifications (for those process models which make use of equilibrium calculations) and the analyses of a number of raw materials.  Note that the models used in this system are specific to the 'SS' set of data files (for the Fe-Cr-Ni system), and can not be applied directly to other systems.

<H2>PYROMAKE UTILITY</H2>

Pyrosim contains a number of built-in models that are generally applicable to any system.  These models describe simple heating (or drying), multi-reaction multi-phase equilibrium (for example, gas-solid or gas-slag-metal), and multi-stage equilibria with continuous removal of the gas phase.  A simple-to-use utility program called Pyromake is supplied with Pyrosim, to allow the user to construct a simulation system containing only the chemical species of interest.  By means of a simple selection from a list of species on the screen, a database containing all the relevant thermodynamic data is automatically constructed.
<P>
The Pyromake utility automatically copies the Pyrosim program to the disk (or directory) where the data files for a particular system are created, thus providing a self-contained simulation disk (or directory) for the system under consideration.  The built-in models can then be used on the selected system.  Energy balance calculations are also performed automatically.
<P>
The Pyromake utility program has now been rendered obsolete by the data export feature in <A HREF="Thermo.htm">Thermo</A> software, which is usually used in conjuction with Pyrosim.

<H2>CONCLUSIONS</H2>

Simulations must be simple to perform and directly applicable if they are to be used successfully.  Experience has shown that simulation programs will be used only if they are able to produce results that are easy to interpret and that can be obtained from a limited quantity of readily available data.  Furthermore, the program must be easy and logical to use.  It is essential for the program to be accessible to as many people as possible, since this is the best way to ensure a steady evolution of improved process models.
<P>
The Pyrosim program can simulate the production of a number of materials by a variety of different process routes.  Similar processes can then be compared on the basis of the costs of raw materials and the consumption of electrical energy.
<P>
The availability of a computer program for the simulation of pyrometallurgical processes should be of value to everyone concerned with the comparison of process routes.  A great deal of time and effort can be saved by the use of such a program.

<H1 ALIGN=center>THERMO</H1>
Thermo is a quick and convenient software package for thermodynamic calculations - for single species and chemical reactions.  It has a built-in user-extendable database containing thermodynamic data for over 800 chemical and mineral species.  Reactions can be entered with full editing facilities.  Thermo checks the balance and tabulates or graphs CP, Delta H, Delta S, Delta G, K, in J, kWh, and cal.
<P>
The program is very useful for energy-balance calculations.  It directly calculates the energy effects of chemical reactions, or processes represented as chemical reactions.  For example, the combustion of propane with 10% excess air, both initially at 25&#176C, can be represented by:<BR>
C3H8 + 11/2 O2 + 20.7 N2 = 3 CO2 + 4 H2O + 1/2 O2 + 20.7 N2<BR>
The calculation shows that this process releases 4.93&nbsp;kWh per kg of propane, if the combustion products are exhausted at 1300&#176C.
<P>
The database can be easily extended or modified, keeping all required data in one convenient place.  The size of the database is not limited by the amount of memory (RAM) in the computer - Thermo keeps the data you use most frequently in memory and dynamically loads other data as needed, updating the data in memory via a least-recently-used algorithm.
<P>
Thermo relieves the tedium of chemical thermodynamics and energy balance calculations.  The calculations can be done reliably, consistently, and rapidly, leaving the user more time to interpret and apply the results.  Thermo combines the ease of use of menus with the speed and convenience of a command-driven user interface.  On-line context-sensitive help is available.  All session information is preserved - enabling the user to carry on working where he left off.
<P>
Thermo was first developed by Rodney Jones & Wolf Meihack in 1985, and has been available commercially since 1990.
<P>
A companion program supplied with Thermo (<B>Density</B>: a mineral density database) makes it easy to find the relative density of most known minerals (over 1400 of them).  The mineral data can be viewed in order of increasing density (as it appears in the data file) or in alphabetical order.
<P>
<I>Availability</I><BR>
Thermo v2.10 (for personal computers using the MS-DOS operating system) is distributed by Philosoft CC, 32 Beacon Road, Hazeldene, Germiston, 1401, South Africa.  Thermo requires at least 450&nbsp;kb of free RAM in order to run.  The software is supplied on a single diskette, and costs R600 or US&nbsp;$220 (valid until 31 December 1996).  An academic discount of 50% is available to staff and students of educational institutions; multi-user discounts are also available.

<H2 ALIGN=center>THE ENVIROPLAS(TM) PROCESS FOR THE RECOVERY OF ZINC, CHROMIUM, AND NICKEL FROM STEEL-PLANT DUSTS</H2>
The ENVIROPLAS process is being developed at Mintek in Randburg, South Africa, for the treatment of solid wastes from the metallurgical industry, especially steel-plant dusts, slags, and leach residues that contain zinc oxide.  The process is based on the carbothermic reduction of selected metal oxides (e.g. zinc oxide), at high temperatures in a DC plasma-arc furnace.  In most countries, the dumping of steel-plant dusts is regarded as presenting an environmental hazard because toxic metals may be leached into drinking-water supplies.  The main objectives of the ENVIROPLAS process are to produce disposable slag, and in the case when electric arc furnace (EAF) dust or zinc-containing waste is processed, to recover metallic zinc in a lead-splash condenser.  When dust from a stainless-steel operation (e.g AOD dust) is smelted, another objective is to recover chromium and nickel into a crude ferroalloy.
<P>
Initial testwork at the 50 to 500&nbsp;kW scales of operation [1-3], was conducted during 1989 to 1993 on the smelting of EAF dust (high-zinc, carbon-steel dust), zinc-bearing alloy-steel dust, lead blast furnace slag, ISF (Imperial Smelting Furnace) slag, and primary leach residue.  The volatilized zinc and lead were burnt in a combustion chamber, and a mixed oxide of zinc and lead was recovered in a bag filter.  High extractions of zinc, chromium and nickel (each more than 95 per cent) were achieved, and the slags produced met the criteria of the US&nbsp;EPA for safe disposal.  This warranted the building of a 3&nbsp;MW demonstration plant, including a plasma-arc furnace and an ISP (Imperial Smelting Processes Ltd, UK) lead-splash condenser.  The plant was successfully commissioned during 1994/95 using about 1000&nbsp;t of lead blast-furnace slag [4,5].
<P>
In 1994 a hydrometallurgical process was developed at Mintek for the dehalogenation of EAF dust.  It is known that high levels of halogens, especially chlorine, interfere with the proper operation of the condenser due to the formation of large quantities of dross.  In 1995 about 300&nbsp;t dehalogenated dust was prepared for demonstration-scale work.  During the latter part of 1995, about 130&nbsp;t of dehalogenated EAF dust containing about 25 per cent zinc oxide, was smelted at a typical dust feed-rate of 1&nbsp;t/h.  About 100&nbsp;kg of coke was used as reducing agent per ton of dust.  The operating power was about 1.3&nbsp;MW and the zinc fuming rate was between 150 and 200&nbsp;kg/h, at operating temperatures of 1450 to 1500&#176C.  Zinc oxide levels of 1 per cent were achieved in the slags tapped from the furnace, which corresponded with zinc extraction efficiencies of about 97 per cent.  The slags were submitted for TCLP leaching tests, and were found to  conform with US&nbsp;EPA disposal regulations.  The zinc tapped from the lead-splash condenser met PW (Prime Western) grade specifications in most cases.  During steady-state operation, zinc condensing efficiencies of 70 to 75 per cent were achieved.  Equipment problems were identified during the demonstration-scale testwork, and these are at present being addressed.  A follow-up smelting campaign is planned for 1996, after implementation of the necessary equipment changes, to demonstrate consistent operation for longer periods of time, at acceptable zinc recoveries.

<B>Synopsis:</B>  Plasma-furnace technology was first applied in Africa in the mid- to late 1970s, when it was realised that advantages could be obtained in the processing of fines for the production of ferro-alloys.  A number of processes have been investigated, and a 40&nbsp;MVA DC transferred-arc ferrochromium furnace has been implemented on an industrial scale at Palmiet Ferrochrome, Krugersdorp.  South Africa has well-developed plasma-furnace research facilities, which include the 3.2&nbsp;MVA DC transferred-arc plasma furnace at Mintek, Randburg.  This paper highlights some of the applications of plasma technology to a variety of ores, minerals, concentrates, metals, and chemicals.  The development and successful implementation of plasma systems is described, as well as the problems that have been experienced with some of the less-successful activities.
<HR>

<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
Interest in the application of plasma technology in Africa developed in the late 1970s, as a result of the perceived benefits of being able to process fines directly.  Southern Africa has the world's largest reserves of several important minerals, including chromium, manganese, vanadium, and platinum ores, many of which are friable.  During the mining of these ores, considerable amounts of fines are generated, and the beneficiation of lower-grade deposits invariably delivers a fine product as a result of comminution.  In the South African context, the capability of the plasma furnace to accept fine feed materials without prior agglomeration is an attractive advantage.
<P>
Materials such as ferrochromium and ferromanganese are conventionally produced in submerged-arc furnaces.  These furnaces normally require a high proportion of lumpy feed materials to achieve good recoveries and to maintain a permeable burden that  permits the escape of gases from the reaction zone beneath the electrodes.  Furthermore, the electrical conductivity of the burden is largely dependent on the characteristics of the carbonaceous reducing agents (reductants) used for a given process.  Variation in conductivity often limits the power level obtainable in such furnaces.  Reductant quality is of great importance and therefore costly high-grade material is required.
<P>
The possibility of plasma-arc technology being developed in such a way as to overcome the abovementioned deficiencies was therefore of some interest to the South African metallurgical industry, which experienced an era of rapid growth during the 1970s.  The oil crisis and South Africa's relatively low-cost electricity (from coal-fired thermal power stations) were responsible for this growth.  This growth encouraged Mintek to pursue the initial investigation of thermal plasma-arc technology, and to evaluate its potential benefits for the processing of minerals and ores in Southern Africa.  Together with the high recoveries that are typical of plasma furnace operation, the direct processing of fines enables this type of furnace to compete favourably with submerged-arc furnaces, particularly in the production of ferro-alloys.
<P>
Some unique advantages of plasma-arc furnace technology for industrial use include the following.<BR>
<UL>
  <LI><I>Fine particle feed capability</I>.  The direct use of fine feed materials is possible, without the need for costly agglomeration.  Plasma systems can operate with a wide range of gas flowrates allowing fine particles to be introduced into a flowing-stream reactor.  Under low gas-flow conditions, fine particles can be bulk charged into a reactor with minimal entrainment and carry-over in the off-gas.  Particles can be introduced through a hollow electrode for maximum exposure to the high-temperature arc environment.</LI>
  <LI><I>Independent energy source</I>.  The feed rate and power can be controlled independently.  The electrical conductivity of the materials does not limit input of power.  The power input to the furnace is largely unconstrained by the resistivity of the materials smelted or remelted.  This allows greater freedom of choice with respect to charge composition, without having to consider the electrical characteristics of the charge.  For example, low-grade coal can be used in place of more expensive anthracite.</LI>
  <LI><I>Gas environment control</I>.  Energy can be provided to a system with any desired oxygen potential (i.e. oxidizing, reducing, or inert gas conditions), independent of the temperature.  This is a distinct advantage over combustion systems where the available energy flux and the oxygen potential are not independent of the temperature.  These characteristics are necessary for the reduction of oxides of chromium, manganese, magnesium, silicon, titanium, and aluminium, i.e. where reactions are highly endothermic or require strongly reducing conditions, or both.  (In contrast, elements such as copper, nickel, zinc, and lead, which usually occur as sulphides, are generally processed at lower temperatures, and require less stringent reducing conditions to produce the metal product.)</LI>
  <LI><I>High temperatures</I>.  The usual gas temperature range of 3000 to 6000&#176C (even up to 10&nbsp;000&#176C) and the gas enthalpies for plasma systems can be significantly higher than those where combustion is the energy source (up to 4000&#176C).</LI>
  <LI><I>High energy fluxes</I>.  High energy fluxes are a result of the higher temperatures, high jet velocities, and higher thermal conductivities of plasma gases that permit the design of reactors with high reaction volume intensities.  For transferred arcs, there is an additional energy flux from the electron transfer at the anode arc root-attachment area.  High energy flux allows high smelting capacity with smaller furnace dimensions.</LI>
  <LI><I>High throughput</I>.  There is considerable scope for the achievement of high throughputs in open-bath processes, because of the higher reaction rates attained by the use of finer feed particles.</LI>
  <LI><I>Gas flowrate control</I>.  The gas mass flowrate and temperature can be controlled independently of the energy input, by proper selection of the plasma system.  In combustion systems, the gas flowrate, temperature, and energy input are interdependent.</LI>
  <LI><I>Electrical energy intensive</I>.  Where hydro-electric or nuclear power is available, decreased dependence on fossil fuels is possible, particularly for off-peak and off-season usage.</LI>
  <LI><I>Rapid response</I>. The furnace can respond to changes in a relatively short period.</LI>
  <LI><I>Low electrode consumption</I>.  The pre-baked graphite electrodes used in DC transferred-arc furnaces are consumed more slowly than the self-baking Soderberg electrodes usually used in AC furnaces, resulting in a higher degree of purity of the melt.  Electrode consumption (expressed in kg per MWh) is lower, but the electrodes are usually of higher quality, and are therefore more expensive.  The lower electrode consumption is due partly to the lower electrode surface area (one electrode instead of the three usually used), and partly to the lower tip-erosion encountered.</LI>
  <LI><I>Control of refractory consumption</I>.  Maximum throughput and furnace efficiency would be attained if a liquid slag layer were maintained right up to the side-walls.  This would be expected to result in high refractory costs due to slag erosion of the side-wall refractories.  A controlled 'freeze lining' of minimum thickness would be the ideal solution to these conflicting requirements, which requires a high degree of control (which is provided by plasma furnace technology).</LI>
  <LI><I>Low noise level</I>.  Electrical and acoustic noise levels are reduced significantly in processes such as steel scrap remelting.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
DC transferred-arc plasma technology is widely preferred for metallurgical processing for the following reasons.<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>The electrical supply characteristics and geometric arrangement of the transferred-arc furnace are similar to those of  conventional submerged-arc furnaces, and the change to DC operation is relatively straightforward.</LI>
  <LI>Scale-up to industrial operation, when a graphite electrode is used, is now feasible.</LI>
  <LI>The use of an open bath of liquid slag and metal (the anode) permits greater control of the process metallurgy than with a choke-fed furnace.</LI>
  <LI>Transferred-arc devices have low cooling-water losses (usually less than 10 per cent).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The most important feature of DC operation is the ability to sustain longer, more stable arcs than AC operation, with independent current and voltage control.  As a result, a significant reduction of electrode consumption, electrical disturbances, and noise can be obtained.
<P>
However, it should be pointed out that, given the same throughput rate and power flux, the thermal efficiency of the plasma-arc furnace is lower than that of a submerged-arc furnace.  Three factors are responsible for this:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>i) more energy is lost, by radiation from the open arc and molten bath, to the walls and roof of the furnace,</LI>
  <LI>ii) some vaporized material is lost to the off-gas stream from the arc-attachment zone, and</LI>
  <LI>iii) little of the sensible energy of the gases evolved is utilized in preheating the feed materials.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The open-bath system provides opportunities for excellent process and product control, but is limited by the loss of volatile materials to the off-gases and by the relatively high losses of power to the roof (50 to 150&nbsp;kW/m&#178).  High throughput rates are therefore necessary to offset the various mechanisms of energy loss.
<P>
Industrial-scale implementation of DC plasma-arc technology followed rapidly on the demonstration-scale testwork carried out at Mintek.  The first two applications were for ferrochromium smelting and remelting of metal fines, and ferromanganese fines melting.
<P>
Applications in Africa to other ores, minerals, concentrates, metals, and chemicals, have been investigated by various organizations.  This paper highlights some of these activities, and explains the development of the successfully implemented plasma technologies, as well as the problems experienced with some of the less successful ones.

<H2>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES</H2>

<H3>Mintek</H3>
Mintek has been involved in research and development work on the application of thermal plasma to process metallurgy since 1976 [1].  In 1979, the DC transferred-arc plasma furnace was identified as probably the most promising approach to the processing of ore fines, and testwork was started on a pilot-plant facility based overseas, as no equipment was available in Africa at that stage.  The DC precessive water-cooled metallic plasma-arc torch in an open-bath furnace configuration, at Tetronics Research and Development Limited in Faringdon, England, was used.  A series of trials (using 300&nbsp;kVA and 1.4&nbsp;MVA transferred-arc furnaces) was carried out for Middelburg Steel and Alloys, who wanted to utilize a plasma arc for the smelting of high-carbon ferrochromium from Transvaal chromite fines and fine, low-cost carbonaceous reducing agents, as well as for the remelting of ferrochromium fines.  The work was successfully piloted at about the 0.4&nbsp;MW level.  However, since the water-cooled plasma torches of that time had limited potential for scale-up, graphite cathodes were used in the pilot-plant facilities that Mintek subsequently established in the early 1980s.
<P>
The first 100&nbsp;kVA (three-phase AC non-transferred-arc) furnace at Mintek was based on the extended-arc flash reactor developed at Toronto University.  This configuration, with three hollow consumable graphite electrodes inclined at 45 degrees from the vertical, was not felt to be suitable for scale-up to industrial size, so work began on a DC transferred-arc furnace with a single electrode.  The hollow graphite electrode, through which the ionizing gas (and feed if desired) can be passed, was mounted vertically in the centre of the furnace.
<P>
The large-scale 3.2&nbsp;MVA facility (installed and commissioned during 1984) is capable of sustained operation at power levels greater than 1&nbsp;MW.  During 1988, the facility underwent a major reconfiguration.  The new furnace is depicted in Figure 1.  The domed brick roof was replaced by a water-cooled conical roof, and the three anode bars embedded in the hearth were replaced by a multiple-pin anode.  A six-component feed system with improved sealing and gas tightness, capable of handling dry materials ranging from 100&nbsp;&#181m to 12&nbsp;mm, was introduced.  As a result, a wider range of metallurgical processes could be evaluated, since a large number of components could be fed simultaneously to the furnace.  The versatile feed system could also distribute the feed either around the 125&nbsp;mm graphite cathode or through a 75&nbsp;mm hole down its centre (to introduce the feed directly into the high-temperature bath area) at a typical feed rate of 1&nbsp;t of total feed per hour, but up to 2&nbsp;t/h can be used.  Although the outer diameter of the furnace shells was reduced, decreasing the mass and the cost of furnace relining, there was no reduction in the attainable power levels or feed rates.

<CAPTION><B>Figure 3:</B> Mintek's 3.2 MVA plasma-arc furnace</CAPTION><BR><BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
Mintek's pyrometallurgical pilot-plant facilities include 50&nbsp;kW, 100&nbsp;kVA (70&nbsp;kW), 200&nbsp;kW, and 3.2&nbsp;MVA (1.0&nbsp;MW) DC plasma-arc furnaces.  These facilities are used for experimental campaigns on a wide range of materials.  The 200&nbsp;kW system is capable of having dry materials ranging from 100&nbsp;&#181m to 6&nbsp;mm fed down the centre of the cathode, around it, or both.  The pilot-plant bay at Mintek has well-developed capabilities for gas handling, and feed systems that include vibratory feeders.
<P>
Hollow graphite electrodes are usually used as cathodes, but water-cooled electrodes have also been used when required.  Graphite electrodes are preferred for most purposes as they impose no limits on current (up to say 100&nbsp;kA), are simpler (requiring less skilled maintenance), and introduce no source of water into the furnace (also saving on the costs of a water-cooling circuit).  
<P>
In a comparison (Stenkvist) between DC arc, AC arc, and DC plasma-gun arc, the graphite-cathode DC arc provides the most efficient energy transfer, with the largest portion of the arc power being transferred directly to the melt.  This high efficiency is due to the fact that a strong, electromagnetically pumped plasma jet convects most of the power toward the anode.  The DC arc, with stable unidirectional convection, is superior to the AC arc in transferring its energy directly to the anode in a metallurgical process.  The consumable graphite electrode is able to operate without water cooling at far higher current and power levels than a plasma torch with water-cooled metal electrodes.  Thus the combination of DC power and graphite electrode provides greater and more flexible opportunities for commercial metallurgical processes.  The disadvantages of DC, compared to AC, involve the necessity for an electrical connection to the liquid metal anode (not necessary in the conventional three-phase AC system), and the extra cost and space required for rectification.
<P>
The major factor affecting electrode erosion is the arc current.  Consequently, for a particular power requirement, any decrease in the current arising from an increase in the voltage implies a decrease in electrode consumption.  At high currents, say over 100&nbsp;kA, the electrode erosion rate is lower for graphite than it is for its major competitor (in transferred-arc devices), thoriated tungsten.  This is of particular importance in energy-intensive smelting processes where the electrode costs per ton of alloy produced are higher than, for example, those for scrap remelting.  However, the improvements in arc stability have usually been accompanied by additional costs such as inert-gas injection, water-cooling of the plasma device, or rectification of the power supply.
<P>
Recent plasma-furnace work at Mintek has involved high-intensity smelting [3,4], the high-temperature reactions in the arc-attachment zone [5], and the application of large-scale plasma systems.[6,7]  Apart from the applications detailed in this paper (iron and steel, ferro-alloys, and light and refractory metals), Mintek has undertaken work on the production of other chromium-containing products such as Cr7C3, the production of pure chromium via the aluminothermic reduction of Cr2O3, and the production of zirconium compounds (Zr, ZrAl3, and partially-stabilized ZrO2 from ZrSiO4).  Pilot-scale work has been done at Mintek on the recovery of copper, nickel, and cobalt from converter slags.  Other applications include the production of ferroniobium, catalyst regeneration, the fuming of lead and zinc from lead blast-furnace slags, and the treatment of low-carbon ferrochromium slags (which have high concentrations of Cr6+).

<H3>Atomic Energy Corporation of South Africa Ltd</H3>
The Atomic Energy Corporation of South Africa Ltd (AEC) has been involved in the development of plasma facilities since about 1987.  The Plasma Technology Department has carried out work in a number of fields.[8]
<P>
DC plasma reduction of uranium hexafluoride (UF6) to uranium tetrafluoride (UF4) with hydrogen or cracked ammonia has been tested.  It was shown that the plasma process can be scaled up to a production rate of 1&nbsp;kg of UF4 per hour, with the possibility of better economy and safety, as well as the advantages of intermittent operation.  It is conservatively estimated that the plasma process could introduce a saving of about one third of the cost of the conventional process (which uses the enthalpy of reaction between the fluorine and the hydrogen).  The plasma process is also safer.  Altogether, just over 13&nbsp;kg of depleted uranium metal (meeting all specifications) has been manufactured from the UF4 product from the plasma process.
<P>
A high-frequency plasma process was utilized to effect <I>in situ</I> fluorination of precipitated beta-UF5, using fluorine (diluted with argon) or CF4 as fluorinating agents.  The CF4, in turn, could possibly be produced economically in a thermal plasma reactor.  This method was seen as a possible economic replacement for the existing processes, for example those utilizing ClF3 or a mixture of F2 and BrF5.
<P>
Uranium metal was controllably fluorinated (in cold- and hot-plasma systems) using CF4 or diluted (10 per cent) fluorine in argon.  This process can be carried out regardless of whether the metal is heated or not.  (It must be pointed out that the work was done with low flowrates of fluorinating agents, and at higher flowrates the possibility of runaway reactions with hot metal cannot be ruled out.)  Dilution of the fluorine with an inert gas is required to render the process controllable.  As expected, the rate of mass loss during fluorination with CF4 was lower than that with fluorine.  This is probably because only one fluorine radical forms per molecule of CF4, resulting in a lower concentration of fluorine.  It was found that plasma-fluorination of uranium with fluorine holds no advantages over direct fluorination, because the reaction rate depends primarily on the concentration of fluorine and the total exposed surface area, and only secondarily on the temperature of the metal.  CF4 is a safer reagent than fluorine, but would have to be made much more cheaply (e.g. directly from CaF2 and carbon) than fluorine to have any significant advantage over the use of fluorine.
<P>
Work on the plasma treatment of inexpensive and readily-available coal fines to produce acetylene, ethylene, and other gases was carried out with a view towards possible commercialisation, but primarily to gain experience with solids feeding, which could be used in the processing of uranium-containing powders.  This work was subsequently terminated.
<P>
In 1982, Mintek assisted the AEC to develop a plasma-arc process for the aluminothermic reduction of high-purity zirconium oxide (upgraded baddeleyite) to produce ZrAl3.  The ZrAl3 was processed in an electron-beam furnace to evaporate the aluminium and produce zirconium metal.  Unfortunately, the metal quality did not quite meet the standards required for nuclear-grade metal.
<P>
Zirconium metal, having the properties of good corrosion resistance at high temperatures, good mechanical strength, and low neutron cross-section, is required for use both in the nuclear and the chemical industries.  A process has been developed at the AEC [9], in which ZrCl4 vapour is reduced with hydrogen to produce metallic zirconium.  A hybrid DC transferred-arc plasma reactor was designed and constructed, in which the required temperatures (between 3000 and 3500&nbsp;K) and reagent ratios (H2:ZrCl4 = 32) could be maintained in a stable plasma column.  An argon plasma at a pressure of 40&nbsp;kPa (absolute) is ignited between a thoriated tungsten cathode and a cylindrical water-cooled copper cathode.  (Graphite electrodes are not used, because graphite sublimates readily at temperatures above 4000&nbsp;K, and nuclear-grade zirconium requires a carbon content of less than 0.008 per cent by mass.)  Regulation of the temperature of a secondary zircalloy-disc anode, by controlling the supply of cooling water, makes it possible to collect the product either as a powder or in a molten metal bath.  A maximum yield of 65 to 68 per cent of the zirconium was collected, as opposed to the thermodynamically possible 95 per cent.  It is suspected that some of the molten metal was re-chlorinated.
<P>
A 96&nbsp;kW plasma furnace was obtained in 1992.  This is to be used for various research projects (i.e. gas heating, waste destruction, and special melting).

<H3>Anglovaal Ltd</H3>
Anglovaal Research Laboratories (a division of Anglovaal Ltd) have small-scale and pilot-plant plasma facilities, based on DC transferred-arc furnaces with graphite electrodes (up to 100&nbsp;mm in diameter).  The facilities, geared to a research environment, include a voltage- and current-controlled power supply that can produce 350&nbsp;kW on a sustainable basis.  The furnaces that can be connected to the power supply include the following:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>20&nbsp;kg/h capacity, graphite- and refractory-lined, up to 1600&#176C</LI>
  <LI>80&nbsp;kg/h capacity, refractory-lined, up to 2200&#176C</LI>
  <LI>80&nbsp;kg/h capacity, specially-lined, up to 2500&#176C</LI>
  <LI>200&nbsp;kg/h capacity, graphite-lined, up to 1600&#176C.</LI>
</UL>
The furnaces have data-logging capabilities, but are controlled manually.  Ancillary equipment includes screw and vibratory feeders, and dust-extraction equipment.
<P>
Plasma development at Anglovaal started in early 1984 with work on the recovery of iron and sulphur compounds by pyrolysis of pyrite and pyrrhotite ores from Prieska.  The plasma facilities have been utilized successfully for work on gold recovery from Eastern Transvaal refractory ores, platinum-group metal (PGM) recovery from chromite-containing ores, high-temperature recovery of refractory metals (including tantalum, niobium, molybdenum, and tungsten), and the production of fused refractories from andalusite.[10]

<H2>APPLICATIONS TO IRON AND STEEL</H2>
The production of iron and steel is currently dominated by the blast furnace -- basic oxygen converter route.  However, plasma-based processes still have a role to play in the production of iron.  For example, electrically generated thermal energy is used for the melting of steel scrap in open-arc electric furnaces.

<H3>Direct reduction of iron ore</H3>
Direct reduction of iron ore in the form of lumpy material or of fines agglomerated as pellets can be carried out in a vertical shaft furnace or a rotary kiln.  Most direct-reduced iron (DRI) is produced in shaft furnaces, where the ore contacts the reducing gas in countercurrent flow in moving or stationary beds.  Gaseous reducing agents, namely carbon monoxide and hydrogen, are introduced to the base of the shaft furnace at elevated temperatures of up to 1000&#176C.  The reducing gas is most commonly produced by the reforming of natural gas, which consists mostly of methane (CH4), in a catalytic reformer vessel.  The endothermic reforming reactions are supported by heating of the reformer vessel by a heat-exchanger in which some of the natural gas is combusted to provide the energy source.  A recently-developed alternative to this reforming method uses thermal plasma to heat the gases directly in the reaction vessel.  The introduction of plasma energy into a gasification system permits operation independent of oxygen potential, and provides efficient energy transfer to the gasifying medium.  Thus the combustion of natural gas to heat the reformer indirectly can be replaced effectively with direct plasma heating inside the vessel, i.e. electrical energy.  However, the plasma device is not directly coupled to the shaft furnace, and hence the plasma is interfaced only indirectly with the process itself.
<P>
The Union Steel Corporation of South Africa (USCO) installed a direct-reduction process [11,12] based on the reforming of a synthetic gas (produced by the gasification of bituminous coal, as practised by SASOL in South Africa) in 1985, with a view to using alternative reforming agents like coal fines at a later stage.  The USCO plant was designed to produce 300&nbsp;kt of DRI per annum.  In each of the three reformer vessels, the energy for the reforming process is provided by an 8&nbsp;MW arc-heater device.  The arc-heater devices were developed by Chemische Werke H&#252ls AG, of Marl, Germany.  In the USCO-H&#252ls process, steam is introduced into the reforming vessel to improve the ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide.  The process off-gas is not recycled back to the reformer vessel but is blended after removal of the water and carbon dioxide with the superhot stream of gas produced in the reformer vessel by the interaction between the high-temperature plasma tail flame, the syngas, and the steam.  The plasma unit attained a chemical efficiency of up to 95 per cent in the conversion of methane to synthesis gas, and was able to achieve H2 to CO ratios from 1:1 to 1:3.  Unfortunately, problems were experienced in the shaft furnace, with the lock-hopper valve systems leaking and sticking (because they could not withstand the variations in temperature and pressure).  The plant was mothballed by USCO in 1987, as a result of economic factors (high electricity cost, high cost of transporting ore from Phalaborwa, and the low price of scrap in 1986).  Iscor bought USCO's steel division in mid-1991, and USCO closed down the sponge-iron and vanadium plants, leaving only the non-ferrous activities intact.

<H3>DRI melting</H3>
DRI and iron ore have been co-melted/smelted to make steel in the pilot-scale furnaces at Mintek.  Low-carbon steels have been produced directly in this manner.[13]  The DC arc furnace has been shown to be very suitable for continuous melting of DRI metallized to 87 to 92 per cent.  Power levels of close to 400&nbsp;kW have been achieved in a furnace with a diameter of 0.44&nbsp;m, so that, at the feed rate of 0.5&nbsp;t/h, the furnace was tapped every 10 to 15 minutes.  A power flux of over 2&nbsp;MW/m&#178 of hearth area has thus been achieved, with an electrical-to-thermal efficiency for melting of DRI of more than 80 per cent, even at this relatively small scale, since the energy loss of about 50&nbsp;kW remained virtually constant with increasing power level.  This confirmed that the energy transfer to the DRI was not rate-limiting as far as melting is concerned, even up to such high values of power flux.  DRI fines have been melted, with a recovery of iron to the steel product of about 90 per cent.  The carbon level in the metal could be readily controlled between 0.1 and 2 per cent by adding a suitable quantity of carbonaceous reducing agent (e.g. coal fines) with the DRI.
<P>
Iscor's plant at Vanderbijlpark, South Africa, is successfully melting DRI in an open-bath operation in conventional ultra-high power (UHP) furnaces using a foaming slag to limit arc flare.[14]

<H3>Steel-plant dusts</H3>
A recent growth area for the application of plasma technology has been the development of processes for the recovery and recycling of metals from industrial residues and wastes.  Plasma processing is particularly well suited to the treatment of wastes, due to its capability of high-temperature chemical processing and handling of fines, and because electricity is a relatively clean source of energy with minimal environmental impact at the process site.  The economic potential is particularly attractive for the disposal of hazardous materials as determined by the environmental economics, and not by the value of the useful products.
<P>
During steelmaking in an electric-arc furnace (EAF), 10 to 15&nbsp;kg of dust, consisting of various metal oxides, is generated per ton of steel product.  In many countries, the disposal of EAF dust in landfill sites is regarded as an environmental hazard, since toxic metals may be leached into drinking water supplies.  In the USA, EAF dust is classified as a hazardous waste, and regulations require it to be treated chemically or thermally to remove or stabilize the leachable toxic metals.
<P>
Steel-plant dusts can be grouped into four broad categories.  They may be grouped according to their content of alloying elements (especially Ni, Cr, Mo, and Mn) as carbon-steel or alloy-steel dusts, and as either low- (<&nbsp;15 per cent) or high-zinc dusts.  Low-zinc carbon-steel dusts represent the least valuable category, and their treatment is generally dictated by environmental rather than economic considerations.  Cheaper chemical or recycling routes may be sufficient for their treatment.  However, alloy-steel dusts (even those low in zinc) require fairly strong reducing conditions to lower the chromium in the slag phase to acceptable levels, thus rendering them suitable for disposal.  The other three dust categories are therefore potential candidates for treatment via electrically-based thermal routes.
<P>
Electrically-based thermal processes allow sealed reactor design, high-energy-density operation at low oxygen potentials, reduced gas volumes, and suitably high off-gas temperatures.  These features have the following major process advantages for the treatment of steel-plant dusts:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>the potential to process the ultra-fine dusts directly, without prior agglomeration, especially when central feeding through a hollow graphite electrode is used,</LI>
  <LI>the potential to condense valuable metals, specifically zinc, directly from the furnace off-gases, and</LI>
  <LI>the potential to strip the slag phase of oxides of chromium  and other alloying elements, resulting in the generation of an innocuous disposable slag, and in the case of alloy-steel dusts, in the concomitant generation of a valuable alloyed metal.</LI>
</UL>
The Enviroplas process (Dust), currently under development at Mintek, is a DC plasma-arc process that can treat EAF dust, alloy-steel dust, or a mixture of both.  The dust is fed to the furnace directly down a hollow graphite electrode.  The process is based on the reduction of selected metal oxides at high temperatures by means of a carbonaceous reducing agent, with the production of an innocuous slag.  In the case of EAF dust, lead and zinc oxides are reduced to their respective metals, volatilized, and then either re-oxidized to a mixed oxide or condensed as metals.  At present, fume is combusted to ZnO and collected in a bag filter.  In the case of alloy-steel dust, a ferro-alloy rich in chromium and nickel is tapped.  From 1989 to date, about 100&nbsp;t of lead blast-furnace slags and steel-plant dusts have been processed at various pilot scales up to 1&nbsp;MW, and the process is at present being further developed to recover metallic zinc directly in a lead splash condenser.
<P>
A proposed 3 MW unit could process around 18&nbsp;kt of EAF dust per annum, or 10&nbsp;kt of alloy-steel dust.  It appears that the proposed units could be operated profitably, even before the avoided costs of disposal are taken into account.
<P>
The disposal problem should be solved at its primary source.  This is compatible with operation on a contracted-out basis.  On-site treatment minimizes potential environmental legal liabilities, and minimizes or eliminates road transport (and the associated cost and taxes).  The waste-management installation could be wholly operated by a contractor.  In this way, the system can be run with no capital costs to the client, with a charge being made purely for services.  This requires no responsibility on the part of the steelmaker for the supervision of operating personnel, or for the maintenance of the equipment.

<H2>APPLICATIONS TO FERRO-ALLOYS</H2>
The development of submerged-arc furnaces appears to have reached a plateau where relatively little further progress can be made in their design and operation.  Ferrochromium smelting (in submerged-arc furnaces) is still constrained by relatively low power densities (less than 0.5&nbsp;MW/m&#178), and high losses of unreduced chromium ore in the slag are typical.  Submerged-arc ferromanganese smelting is characterized by relatively high losses of manganese oxide to the slag (typically 20 per cent by mass) and low-resistance operation that gives rise to poor power factors, i.e. low megawatts given high MVA values.  The electrical resistance in these processes is determined largely by the raw materials used, and this interrelation can have an adverse affect on the stability of the operation, particularly at high power levels.  Both of these processes therefore depend on carefully selected raw materials; direct control of the operations is difficult owing to their very long time constants (days).  On the positive side, these furnaces have a fairly high electrical-to-thermal efficiency, typically 85 to 90 per cent, and they require rebuilding only after several years of operation.  Furthermore, the chemistry of the processes, although somewhat constrained, is virtually self-regulating, and only limited amounts of high-temperature volatile species are lost to the off-gases.
<P>
South Africa has very large reserves of three of the most important oxide ores, namely iron ore, chromium ore, and manganese ore.  In addition, it has reasonably abundant resources of carbonaceous reducing agents in the form of bituminous coals, and relatively low-cost electrical power.  As a result, up to 50 per cent of the ores mined are converted locally to the metallic form.  Conventional methods for the processing of these materials generally require lumpy sized material, whereas fairly large quantities of fines are produced during mining activities.  Although agglomeration techniques are well established, they are costly, and therefore a strong motive exists for processes to be developed that use fine feed materials directly, and which are flexible with respect to the choice of the raw materials and the energy source.  Furthermore, the preheating of fine materials in, for example, a fluidized-bed reactor, as a means for the saving of electrical energy, is potentially a very cost-effective method whereby operating costs can be lowered with a relatively small additional capital expenditure.
<P>
Among the first metallurgical processing tests conducted at Mintek using plasma technology was the remelting of alloy and metal fines arising from the crushing, screening and recovery operations associated with conventional ferro-alloy processing technology.  These fines, which are often contaminated with slag, are of relatively low value, and can pose problems when fed back to conventional submerged-arc furnaces.
<P>
It was not only demonstrated that ferrochromium fines could readily be remelted, but also that partial refining could be achieved.  For example, in tests using 100 parts of ferrochromium fines, 28.6 of fine chromite, and 4.3 parts of quartz, the silicon content was lowered from 3 to as little as 0.11 per cent, and the carbon from 6.6 to 4 per cent.
<P>
Ferromanganese fines were also successfully remelted, and it was found that carbon and silicon levels were lowered by the remelting process.

<H3>Ferrochromium</H3>
Due to the abundant chromite fines available in South Africa at lower costs, it made economic sense to investigate a metallurgical process whereby fines could be directly converted to chromium alloys without first having to be agglomerated.  This is a costly and sometimes not entirely effective process.  Although nowadays a significant fraction of fines can be fed to submerged-arc furnaces, the chromium recovery suffers greatly as a result.
<P>
Following a joint development by Mintek, Middelburg Steel and Alloys, and ASEA of Sweden, a 16&nbsp;MVA (14&nbsp;MW) DC transferred-arc furnace was installed at Krugersdorp, and commissioned in December 1983.  This demonstration-scale prototype furnace replaced an existing 9&nbsp;MW submerged-arc furnace.  The furnace shell was 7.5&nbsp;m in diameter and 2.4&nbsp;m in height, with side-walls lined with magnesia bricks and an outer roof of water-cooled refractory-lined panels.  The single central hollow graphite electrode was 560&nbsp;mm in diameter.  Nitrogen was passed down the central hole to maintain the stability of the plasma.  Startup and commissioning took place during 1984 and 1985, and satisfactory operation was achieved in 1986.  During the six years following installation, the furnace was developed further into a successful production unit, reaching its fully-installed power level.
<P>
The furnace was totally closed, and the feed could enter through the hollow electrode or through three gas-tight ports in the furnace roof.  Dried chromite fines were batched in various proportions with fluxes and reductants according to the set recipe required for the grade of chromium alloy to be produced, and stored in primary bins above the furnace, from which vibrating feeders supplied the four feed ports.
<P>
The initial feed for the plasma furnace was a blend of coke and chromium ore fines, plus recycle charge-chrome fines that constituted from 10 to 50 per cent of the total feed.  The chromium recovery exceeded 90 per cent, which was greater than that achieved in conventional smelting furnaces.
<P>
A major advantage of the plasma design is the closed-top furnace, which can allow the recovery of the sensible and combustion energy of the hot carbon monoxide off-gas for preheating of the feed.
<P>
Table 1 compares the production of ferrochromium in the plasma-arc furnace with that by conventional submerged-arc smelting.  It is evident that the chromium content of the alloys was similar, but that the recovery of chromium was improved significantly by use of the plasma-arc process.[16]  The sulphur and phosphorus contents of the alloy produced in the plasma furnace are less than half those given in the standard specification.

<P>
By 1987, the process and the furnace were performing well, and during 1988 the average power level achieved was 12&nbsp;MW; the maximum level obtainable with the 16&nbsp;MVA power supply was 14&nbsp;MW.  The production of ferrochromium was 18&nbsp;kt/a.
<P>
Towards the end of 1987, MS&A decided to uprate the furnace to 40&nbsp;MVA, so that the production of ferrochromium could be increased.  Other considerations included the anticipated improved thermal efficiency of a larger furnace, together with the demonstrated advantages with regard to the cost of raw materials.  The 40&nbsp;MVA furnace was installed at the end of 1988, and the relative simplicity of the design contributed to the relatively low cost of the conversion.  A conductive hearth and bottom electrode developed by ASEA [18] are used in the furnace.  The furnace shell is 9&nbsp;m in diameter and 3.8&nbsp;m high.[17]  Power was switched on to the furnace on 13&nbsp;December 1988, and it was planned that full power would be reached early in 1990.  An electric current of up to 60&nbsp;kA is used.
<P>
The 40&nbsp;MVA (32&nbsp;MW) furnace at Palmiet Ferrochrome (previously known as the Krugersdorp plant of Middelburg Steel and Alloys, and now a division of Samancor Ltd), depicted in Figure 2, succeeds the previous unit as still the only open-bath DC transferred-arc furnace world-wide for producing ferrochromium alloys.  The fully computerized furnace, which was designed and manufactured in South Africa, is supported by state-of-the-art ancillary plant and equipment, all designed locally.
<P>

</CENTER>
<P>
The furnace can be closed more easily because of its single-electrode operation and simpler feed distribution, and can therefore make use of the excess thermal energy in the furnace off-gases for pre-heating or pre-reduction of the incoming charge.
<P>
The furnace responds rapidly to changes in operating conditions or charge inputs, because smelting is carried out under open-bath conditions.  The rapid response time and greater flexibility in the process, make it possible for a plasma furnace to produce a wider range of alloy compositions than can be produced in a submerged-arc furnace.
<P>
For the smelting of chromium ores, plasma furnaces have several important advantages, both technical and economic, over conventional submerged-arc furnaces.  These include:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>the use of cheaper chromite ore as unprocessed fines</LI>
  <LI>the direct use of finely sized (<&nbsp;6&nbsp;mm) chromite ore, reducing agents, and flux material, thereby reducing the costs of the raw materials</LI>
  <LI>the use of anthracite or coal, thereby avoiding a reliance on expensive reducing agents such as metallurgical coke and char</LI>
  <LI>the wider choice of reducing agents, allowing the selection of, for example, low-phosphorus reductants</LI>
  <LI>a higher chromium recovery (more than 90 per cent) than that obtained in conventional submerged-arc furnaces  (75 to 80 per cent)</LI>
  <LI>the assimilation of charge-chrome fines when required</LI>
  <LI>independence from the electrical resistivity constraints imposed by the feed and the reaction products in the submerged-arc furnace</LI>
  <LI>the ability to select the process temperature, irrespective of the raw materials and their physico-chemical properties, by control of the feed rate and power level</LI>
  <LI>the possibility that the metallurgical smelting process could be modified as a result of the above points, to permit greater flexibility in the specification of the product, e.g. carbon, silicon, chromium, sulphur, and phosphorus contents.</LI>
</UL>
Despite these anticipated advantages, it was recognized that the consumption of electrical energy was likely to be the same as that in conventional submerged-arc furnaces, and possibly even greater.

<H3>Ferromanganese</H3>
Ferromanganese fines have been remelted in the 100&nbsp;kVA pilot-scale furnace at Mintek, and at the 4&nbsp;MW level in the 10.8&nbsp;MVA Freital / Voest-Alpine furnace at Samancor's Metalloys plant in Meyerton, South Africa (which started up in 1983).
<P>
Ore reduction has been carried out at the 100&nbsp;kVA pilot scale at Mintek, for the production of ferromanganese-silicon (FeMnSi) and high-carbon ferromanganese (HCFeMn).  In the case of HCFeMn production, high manganese losses were experienced because of evaporation.  Samancor's 10.8&nbsp;MVA furnace was also used to produce FeMnSi and HCFeMn.
<P>
The Samancor furnace, which  has a single water-cooled plasmatron (transferred-arc device), was designed primarily to melt ferromanganese metal fines.  The rating of the thyristor-controlled power supply is 10.8&nbsp;MVA, and the plasma device itself is capable of operation up to 9&nbsp;kA and 800&nbsp;V, although voltages above 200 to 300&nbsp;V are not easily attainable in practice.  Power levels of only some 2 to 4&nbsp;MW are therefore obtainable unless higher voltages can be reached.  However, it was found that higher voltages caused stray arcing into the water-cooled parts of the roof, and even into the off-gas duct.  At these power levels, the electrical-to-thermal efficiency would be expected to be fairly low.  The design capacity is 50&nbsp;kt/a for fines remelting, although this level has never been reached.
<P>
Mintek has also carried out a considerable amount of work on the melting and smelting of ferromanganese alloys in open-bath transferred-arc systems.[19]  If the power density for melting is matched to the furnace size, then efficient operation with good recoveries can be achieved.  However, smelting results in excessive losses of manganese vapour, and a shaft-furnace approach would appear to be a more suitable configuration.
<P>
Open-bath furnaces have the disadvantage that the off-gas  exits directly  from the system, resulting in high energy losses, and the loss of approximately 10 per cent of the manganese through evaporation.  This is caused by the high vapour pressure of manganese at temperatures around 1700 to 1900&#176C.  Consequently, the manganese yield of such systems is only approximately 50 to 60 per cent, and the manganese content in the metal is limited to between 72 and 77 per cent.  The energy consumption of such processes is between 3.8 and 4.5&nbsp;MWh/t of ferromanganese.  These tests were carried out in a cylindrical 5&nbsp;t plasma furnace with a central 3&nbsp;-&nbsp;5&nbsp;MW plasma torch at Voest-Alpine Industrieanlagenbau and Samancor.
<P>
The high manganese loss, as well as the high energy demand, gave rise to the development of the so-called boot furnace [20], depicted in Figure 3.  This furnace (which uses the power supply of the furnace previously mentioned) combines the features of an open-bath and a shaft furnace.  The main feature is that the manganese evaporated in the plasma zone is condensed in the burden, and the thermal energy of the off-gas is used for preheating and partial prereduction of the material -- as in the submerged-arc furnace.  The manganese loss by evaporation is intended to be reduced to approximately 3 per cent, and the manganese yield increased to approximately 84 per cent.  The manganese content of ferromanganese should be within a range of 76 to 78 per cent, and the energy consumption should be approximately 3&nbsp;MWh/t.  At a furnace power of 2.5&nbsp;MW, this corresponds to a production rate of approximately 0.8&nbsp;t of ferromanganese per hour.  Compared to the conventional submerged-arc furnace process for ferromanganese production, the advantage of the boot furnace design is that fines can also be used as input material.

<P>
Of considerable importance is the fact that the unit described can also be operated with oxygen plasma torches for refining.  Investigations are currently being made into the smelting of low-carbon ferromanganese in one process step.  Promising tests have already been carried out in the 5&nbsp;t plasma furnace of Voest-Alpine Industrieanlagenbau, and the 'boot furnace' at Metalloys is currently undergoing commissioning.

<H3>Ferrosilicon and silicon</H3>
Melting of ferrosilicon and silicon metal fines has been carried out at pilot scale at Mintek.

The carbothermic reduction of silica to produce silicon in an open-bath transferred-arc plasma furnace results in high losses of silicon monoxide, and therefore a shaft-furnace process is preferred.  However, success was achieved in the co-melting of silicon fines (in the form of an off-grade product from the production of silicon) and reject high-carbon ferromanganese or high-carbon ferrochromium fines to produce a wide range of medium- to low-carbon silicide alloys.  Compositions of standard and, in some instances, even better, specifications have been produced.  During the co-melting and subsequent cooling processes, the carbon from the high-carbon alloys is exsolved as a result of its very limited solubility in high-silicon alloys.  Most of these co-melting tests were carried out in Mintek's 100&nbsp;kVA transferred-arc plasma batch furnace.
<P>
Silicon fines were remelted successfully, and good recoveries of upgraded silicon were obtained.

<H3>Ferrovanadium</H3>
Ferrovanadium is conventionally produced by the aluminothermic reduction of vanadium pentoxide in the presence of metallic iron.  This process is highly exothermic when practised on a large scale, but small-scale work requires the addition of electrical energy to offset the losses of energy.  Small-scale production of ferrovanadium (to the ISO specification for FeV80), using aluminothermic reduction of V2O5, has been carried out.
<P>
A process was conceptualized at Mintek for the carbothermic reduction of V2O5 to produce a vanadium sub-oxide (approximately VO), which is then reduced further using aluminium, with the iron being added as metal.  The plasma furnace would be well suited to supplying the energy requirements of this endothermic process.  Preliminary testwork to demonstrate the validity of this concept was undertaken on Mintek's 100&nbsp;kVA plasma furnace at a power level of about 30&nbsp;kW.  The initial results were reasonably encouraging, with an alloy containing 85%&nbsp;V being produced, although the carbon content of the final alloy was too high.

<H3>Ferrotitanium</H3>
Attempts were made to produce ferrotitanium (containing 70%&nbsp;Ti) from high-titania slag, via aluminothermic reduction in Mintek's 200&nbsp;kW DC transferred-arc plasma furnace.  This grade is usually produced by the co-melting of titanium scrap with iron.  Unfortunately, the alloy produced contained only 56 per cent titanium, and had a titanium-to-aluminium mass ratio of only four.  Further tests in a specially designed 30&nbsp;kW furnace from which air could effectively be excluded, managed to reduce the nitrogen content of the alloy, but were not able to sufficiently lower the oxygen content.  It was concluded that the desired alloy could not be produced in a single stage using this type of process.

<H2>APPLICATIONS TO LIGHT AND REFRACTORY METALS</H2>

<H3>Magnesium</H3>
Magnesium has been produced at Mintek [21] by a modified version of the industrial Magnetherm process, a plasma-arc system being used instead of the submerged-electrode furnace normally employed, and the reaction being carried out at atmospheric pressure instead of under vacuum.  Both 50 and 100&nbsp;kVA DC transferred-arc furnaces, each with a single graphite electrode, were used in the tests.  The raw materials constituting the charge were burnt dolomite (77 per cent), ferrosilicon (13 per cent), and alumina (10 per cent).  The magnesium vapour produced in the furnace was recovered in a condenser-filter unit connected behind the furnace.  Based on slag analyses, the efficiency of extraction was found to be about 85 per cent.  Analysis of the crude condensed magnesium indicated that a product of high purity (99.8 per cent) is attainable by thermal reduction in a plasma-arc furnace.  Operation at atmospheric pressure has the advantage that the process can be adapted easily to semi-continuous or continuous operation, and that the vaporization of the relatively volatile manganese and silicon is suppressed.  The levels of manganese and silicon in the crude magnesium produced were about 0.02 and 0.04 per cent respectively.  The development of this process resulted in the installation of a 2&nbsp;-&nbsp;3&nbsp;MW, semi-industrial scale, plasma furnace for magnesium production at Samancor's Metalloys plant.
<P>
The silicothermic production of magnesium in a plasma furnace has been shown to be technically viable, (assuming the addition of an efficient condenser, such as an ISP-type splash condenser to the process).  However, at present, there is no cost advantage over present electrolytic processes, so the work has been shelved by Samancor for the time being.

<H3>Ilmenite smelting</H3>
Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) employs four rectangular six-in-line graphite-electrode furnaces for the smelting of ilmenite.  Each furnace is 19&nbsp;m long, 8&nbsp;m wide, and has a power supply rated at 105&nbsp;MVA (each pair of electrodes being supplied by a 35&nbsp;MVA transformer).[22,23]  Each of these three-phase open-arc furnaces is rated at 69&nbsp;MW.  The process technology, originally developed by Quebec Iron & Titanium (QIT Fer et Titane) of Sorel, Canada, was supplied to RBM in the mid-1970s, with the first furnace starting up in early 1978.  The fourth furnace started up in mid-1991.  The process has been adapted to smelt fine ilmenite obtained from a beach-sand deposit on the north-eastern coast of South Africa.  A open-bath approach is employed, for which careful control is required to avoid erosion of the refractories of the side- and end-walls by the very reactive titania slag.  The installed electrical capacity possibly makes these furnaces the largest scale AC transferred-arc plasma operation to date.  RBM is currently the only South African producer of titania slag, and has an annual production capacity of some 2&nbsp;Mt of ilmenite (FeO.TiO2) and 125&nbsp;kt of rutile (TiO2).  The ilmenite is smelted to produce about 1&nbsp;Mt of slag and 550&nbsp;kt of pig iron per annum.[26]  RBM's ilmenite is of too low a grade to be used directly for the production of pigment or synthetic rutile.  Therefore, RBM followed the slag-beneficiation route, and currently produces about half of world titania slag output.
<P>
Small-scale batch tests have been carried out in a 50&nbsp;kW DC transferred-arc plasma furnace at Mintek and in a 40&nbsp;kW water-cooled plasma furnace at the Mineral Resources Center of the University of Minnesota [24], to investigate the reduction of ilmenite to yield a high-grade titania slag and a pig iron by-product.  The work was aimed at producing a slag suitable for use as a feedstock for the fluidized-bed production of titanium tetrachloride.  The tests were conducted on three different ilmenite concentrates with widely differing chemical compositions and geological histories.  The influence of parameters such as the particle size of the reducing agent, the amount of carbon addition, and the reaction time on the grade of the slag and the recoveries of titanium and iron were studied.  The thermal balance of the furnace was carefully controlled to maintain a protective 'freeze lining' to ensure that the graphite crucible and titania slag did not react chemically.  The electrical and physical characteristics of the DC transferred-arc plasma furnace were found to be well suited to the smelting of ilmenite.  Stable furnace operation was observed during the processing of all three ilmenite concentrates, and slags containing more than 80 per cent titanium dioxide (by mass) were readily obtained.  It should be mentioned here that work has also been carried out on the production of ferrotitanium in a DC transferred-arc plasma furnace.[25]
<P>
Several companies are investigating the possibility of developing new titanium projects in Southern Africa, including deposits in Natal, Transkei, and Mozambique.  Of these, only Anglo American's Namakwa Sands project has been formally announced.  This R1000&nbsp;million (US&nbsp;$340 million) project on the Cape west coast was approved in November 1992.  The project will comprise a mining operation near Brand-se-Baai, where heavy mineral concentrates will be produced.  Production is scheduled to start in 1994, at an initial mining rate of 4&nbsp;Mt of sand per annum.  The full production rate is expected to reach 16&nbsp;Mt/a.  Reserves are in excess of 500&nbsp;Mt.  The concentrates will be transported by road to the Koekenaap plant where ilmenite, zircon, and rutile will be recovered.  Zircon and rutile will be exported as high-purity concentrates, whilst the ilmenite will be smelted at a plant between Vredendal and Saldanha.
<P>
In order to proceed with the project, Anglo American needed to develop a new process to smelt ilmenite, as the QIT/RBM process is held under licence.  (The high electrical conductivity of titania slags and the accurate control of the slag composition effectively rule out the use of conventional submerged-arc technology for the smelting of ilmenite.)  The corporation has successfully developed a process, in partnership with Mintek, based on single hollow-electrode plasma furnace technology.[26-28]  The first of two furnaces is expected to come onstream during 1995.  When the mine is at full production, the operation is expected to treat 1200&nbsp;kt of primary concentrate per annum, to produce 195&nbsp;kt of ilmenite slag, 120&nbsp;kt of pig iron, 140&nbsp;kt of zircon, and 38&nbsp;kt of rutile.[28]

<H2>CHEMICAL APPLICATIONS</H2>

<H3>Calcium carbide</H3>
Semi-continuous production of calcium carbide (from lime or dehydrated calcium hydroxide) in a plasma furnace has been demonstrated on a pilot scale at Mintek, in DC transferred-arc plasma furnaces rated at 50&nbsp;kVA, 200&nbsp;kVA (operated at 140&nbsp;kW), and 3.2&nbsp;MVA (operated at 500&nbsp;kW).  Excellent agreement was obtained between the experimental results and the results of simulations carried out during a detailed thermodynamic study of the carbothermic production of calcium carbide at elevated temperatures.  A maximum grade of 93 per cent CaC2 was achieved during batch tests, while grades above 80 per cent CaC2 (higher than those produced in industrial carbide operations) were realized during semi-continuous operation.  The results of the work also suggest that the calcium units could be recirculated after acetylene generation.[29]
<P>
The high operating temperatures prevented the build-up of unwanted impurities in the carbide.  The recirculation of the calcium units to the carbide-producing furnace would be a possible advantage of the plasma route.

<H2>SIMULATION AND CONTROL</H2>

<H3>Pyrosim</H3>
Pyrosim (Pyrosim) is a general-purpose computer program, developed at Mintek, for the steady-state simulation of pyrometallurgical processes.  One of the primary strengths of the program is its built-in capability to calculate multicomponent multiphase equilibria, along with the automatic performance of energy-balance calculations.  This predictive ability allows the program to simulate novel processes rather accurately.
<P>
The program was originally developed for the purpose of simulating processes for the production of raw stainless steel.  However, it has also been applied successfully to the processing of ferro-alloys, metal carbides, base metals, and refractory metals, as well as preheating, prereduction, and combustion processes.  Models (empirical / phenomenological as well as predictive) have been developed for a number of process units and process steps, including a heater / drier, fluidized bed, and rotary kiln, as well as for electric-arc furnaces.  Some of these models also provide a significant quantity of derived information, such as the liquidus temperature, viscosity, and basicity of slags, as well as gas ratios and degrees of reduction.
<P>
Predictive modelling of plasma-arc furnaces has been particularly successful, as these furnaces often come close to allowing multi-reaction multi-phase equilibrium to be attained.  Pyrosim has recently been used successfully to model the plasma-arc treatment of electric-arc furnace dust, a process that is inherently complex because of the number of chemical elements involved.

<H3>PlasmaSim</H3>
Work is currently underway at Mintek towards the development of a computer program to model the dynamic behaviour of the bath of a plasma-arc smelting furnace.  The techniques of computational fluid dynamics (two-dimensional, axisymmetric) are to be used to study the variation in temperature, fluid flow, voltage, current, phase changes, and chemical composition (in a multiphase reacting system) throughout the bath of the furnace.  The variation of these quantities with time can then be studied to predict and add to the understanding of such aspects of the process as the position of the freeze-line in water-cooled furnaces, and the effects (on temperature and chemical composition of products) of introducing feed materials at different areas of the bath.  This will allow side-feeding to be contrasted with centre-feeding.

<H3>Control</H3>
The control of an open-bath process is extremely critical, because of the ease with which unwanted reactions can become significant if a suitable temperature and feed distribution are not maintained.  The reaction rate is rapid because small particles are used.  The vapour loss from the hot zone of the furnace can be high because of the rapid and direct evolution of gases from the surface reaction layer, with little possibility that the vapour will condense on cooler, incoming solid material.
<P>
A balance must be maintained between the feed rate and the power input to a plasma furnace, to ensure a relatively constant operating temperature.  As a result of the short response time of the system, there is a need for a higher level of control than is currently required in the operation of a submerged-arc furnace.  The short time-constants associated with the process emphasize the necessity for the feed of raw materials to be set at the correct rate, and for a wide range of other variables to be maintained and controlled.  Stable metallurgical performance is obtained when there is an adequate level of control over the operation.  The most important factor is the ratio of feed rate of raw materials to power input.  This ratio is not a constant, and it has to be updated regularly as furnace conditions change.
<P>
To control the feed rate effectively, a multiple-hopper system with a ramp feed-rate controller was designed and constructed at Mintek, and very accurate proportioning of the different feed materials was achieved at all times.  In addition, it is important that feeding continues whenever the power is on.  If an arc is maintained while no raw material is being fed, localized bath temperatures increase rapidly, damaging the refractories and causing unwanted side-reactions.

<H2>CONCLUSIONS</H2>
The investigations into, and the development of, plasma-arc technologies for various applications in the metallurgical industry have resulted in several commercial successes in South Africa.  (The authors are not aware of any plasma furnaces in Africa outside of South Africa.)  The large-scale operations have all used graphite electrodes instead of water-cooled torches.  The current trend has been to a single electrode operating with DC instead of AC, and at power levels of up to 30&nbsp;MW.  Ferro-alloy processes, in particular ferrochromium smelting and ferromanganese fines remelting, have been scaled up to industrial operation, but re-applications have been limited because the technology has been closely guarded.
<P>
Further development work will be necessary if silicon, ferrosilicon, and ferromanganese alloys are to be smelted in plasma-arc furnaces, because the vapour species generated by the process cause unacceptable losses.  Applications to refractory materials and light metals (e.g. magnesium) are being pursued, and a commercial project is being planned for ilmenite smelting using DC plasma-arc technology developed by Mintek.
<P>
Because of its level of industrialization, South Africa has taken the lead in Africa in the development of plasma-arc technology.  South African companies are well placed, therefore, to assist countries in the rest of Africa with the technology, under suitable commercial arrangements.

<P>
Valuable metals, such as cobalt, can be recovered from slags by
treating these waste materials with a carbonaceous reducing agent
in a DC-arc furnace.  This technology is applicable to the recovery
of nickel, cobalt, copper, and platinum group metals from furnace
or converter slags emanating from copper or nickel smelters treating
sulphide concentrates.  Pilot-plant testwork at Mintek has demonstrated
recoveries of 98% for nickel and over 80% for cobalt, at power
levels of up to 600&nbsp;kW.  Results of computer simulations
and experimental tests are presented.
<P>
<P>
<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
Slags produced by non-ferrous smelters usually contain significant
quantities of valuable metals, such as cobalt, nickel, and copper,
present both in an entrained metallic or sulphide form, and in
a dissolved oxidized form.  These slags can emanate from either
furnaces (e.g. six-in-line, reverberatory, or flash) or from converters;
they may be internal recycle streams or final waste products.
 Large quantities of valuable metals are present in the huge dumps
that have built up over many years of operation of nickel and
copper smelters.  Slags are sometimes treated by slow cooling,
milling, and flotation.  This approach is satisfactory when the
metals in the slag are in either the sulphide or metallic form,
but is not suitable for the recovery of oxidized metals.  Cobalt
in particular, and nickel to a lesser extent, are found in an
oxidized form, and for these slags, treatment in an electric furnace
operated under reducing conditions is necessary.<BR>

<P>
Conventional slag cleaning furnaces (typically AC submerged-arc)
rely largely on a gravity settling mechanism, whereby the entrained
sulphide and metallic droplets are simultaneously collected. 
Sometimes, a quantity of matte is added to the slag, to enhance
the coalescence of entrained matte droplets.  However, conditions
are not usually sufficiently reducing to recover much of the cobalt.
 Cobalt recoveries may be as low as 20 per cent.  The most effective
means for the recovery of metals involves the addition of a reductant
(such as carbon) to capture some of the metals present in an oxidized
form.  Processes have previously been described in which carbothermic
reduction has been carried out in electric furnaces (1-3).<BR>

<P>
The aim of a slag cleaning process is to maximize the recovery
of valuable metals (such as Co, Ni, and Cu) in an alloy with the
lowest possible iron content.  The amount of metallic iron produced
should be kept to a minimum, as the more iron present in the resulting
matte or alloy, the greater the cost of the subsequent hydrometallurgical
separation of the valuable metals, and the resulting disposal
of the iron residues.  Because of the similarities in the reduction
behaviour of cobalt and iron, some loss of cobalt is inevitable
while separating the iron from the nickel and copper.<BR>

<P>
Mintek has been working on the recovery of cobalt, and the associated
valuable metals, from slags, since 1988, using DC-arc furnace
technology to effect selective carbothermic reduction of the oxides
of cobalt, nickel, copper, (and zinc, where present), while retaining
the maximum possible quantity of iron as oxide in the slag.<BR>

<P>
Many non-ferrous smelters employ a process whereby the concentrates
are fed to a furnace which produces a matte (for further treatment)
and a slag (which is dumped).  The furnace matte is treated in
a converter (often of the Peirce-Smith type) to remove most of
the remaining iron and sulphur.  This resulting 'white matte'
or alloy is then treated hydrometallurgically.  The converter
slag is usually recycled to the furnace.  Because of the highly
oxidizing conditions in the converter, much of the cobalt is oxidized.
 The turbulent conditions cause entrainment of valuable metals
as well.  Of all the streams in a flowsheet of this sort, the
converter slag is richest in cobalt.  As shown in Figure 1, it
is possible to divert this liquid stream of converter slag for
slag cleaning, allowing most of the valuable metals to be reclaimed.
 The impoverished slag can still be recycled to the furnace (with
fairly minimal disruption to the existing process, and with the
benefit of reduced quantities of magnetite which otherwise builds
up in the furnace), or can be dumped (breaking the recycle entirely,
necessitating some changes to the operation of the furnace).

<P>
A second possibility is to leave the converter slag recycle stream
alone, and focus on the treatment of the furnace slag which is
the point at which the waste materials finally leave the process.
 It is also possible to treat material from existing slag dumps
at the same time, as the dumped material is usually similar to
the furnace slag currently being produced.  This option is shown
in Figure 2.  It is, of course, also possible to use  a hybrid
of these approaches.

<CENTER><B>THEORETICAL BACKGROUND<BR></B></CENTER>
<P>
A wide range of slags are amenable to slag cleaning.  These slags
differ according to the ores which have been processed, as well
as according to the type of process, and whether the slags have
arisen from furnaces or from converters.  Most of the slags of
interest are rich in iron oxide and silica, and many have a bulk
composition approximating that of fayalite.  Fortunately, similar
principles apply to the treatment of all of these slags, although
the actual results will differ according to the composition of
the slag.  For the sake of illustration, two representative slags
are shown in Table I, differing primarily in the level of cobalt
contained in the slag.<BR>

<P>
Note that, for the purposes of these calculations, all of the
Co, Cu, and Ni in the feed slag was assumed to be in the oxidized
form, i.e. present as CoO (1.272% or 0.254%), Cu<SUB>2</SUB>O
(0.563%), and NiO (2.546%).<BR>
<BR>

<P>
When carbon is added to the slag, the various metallic elements
reduce to different extents, at a given level of carbon addition.
 This behaviour allows a reasonable degree of separation to take
place during smelting.  The intention in this part of the process
is to separate the valuable non-ferrous metals from the iron and
the gangue constituents present in the slag.  Figure 3 illustrates
the differences in reducing behaviour between nickel, cobalt,
and iron. The desirable area of operation is clearly somewhere
in the region where the recovery of cobalt is high, and the recovery
of iron to the alloy is still reasonably low.  Note that, in actual
practice, there is less than 100 per cent carbon utilization,
and the carbon addition would need to be somewhat higher than
that shown here, because of burn-off of some of the reductant.

<P>
The calculations for Figures 3, 4, and 5 were carried out using
Mintek's Pyrosim computer software (4) for the calculation of
steady-state mass and energy balances for pyrometallurgical processes.
 These simulations were based on the assumption of chemical equilibrium
between gas, slag, and alloy.  The equilibrium composition was
calculated using free-energy minimization, together with the Ideal
Mixing of Complex Components solution modelling technique.  An
entrainment of 2 per cent of the matte in the resulting slag was
assumed, as this was found to agree well with experimental results
from DC-arc furnace testwork.  Of course, there is a spread of
experimental data around the simulated values, as the model does
not take into account subtle differences in the mode of operation
of the furnace.  It should be noted that a good mineralogical
description of the slag feed is required in order to provide an
accurate estimate of the energy requirements of the process. 
(Pyrosim can also be used in non-predictive mode, using the empirical
Pyrobal model, which allows the user to specify, for example,
the actual experimentally obtained percentages of cobalt and nickel
in the slag, or the distribution of iron between metal and slag.
 This is very useful for generating a completely consistent mass
balance from incomplete or conflicting experimental data, where
at least some information is known to be accurate.)<BR>

<P>
The equilibrium behaviour shown in Figure 3 is not very sensitive
to temperature, and curves plotted for temperatures 100&#176;C
colder or hotter are virtually indistinguishable from those presented.
 Clearly, the temperature has effects other than on the chemical
thermodynamics of the system.  It has been reported elsewhere
(6) that a 100&#176;C increase in temperature may decrease the
cobalt and nickel solubility in slag by as much as three times,
at a constant partial pressure of oxygen, and at a temperature
around 1300&#176;C.  However, the solubility is even more strongly
affected by the reducing nature of conditions in the furnace (i.e.
the partial pressure of oxygen in the system).<BR>

<P>
The most striking feature of this separation process is the variation
of cobalt recovery according to the iron content in the alloy.
 This behaviour is shown in Figure 4.  It can be seen that the
recovery of cobalt (in percentage terms) is highest (albeit not
by very much) in the case of the slag with the highest initial
cobalt content.  This is in line with experimental findings (2,7)
that recoveries are dependent on initial slag composition, with
higher grades leading to better recoveries.  If we accept the
evidence presented elsewhere (7) that metallic Fe is the effective
(intermediary) reductant in the process, it may be more correct
to say that the recovery of valuable metals is related to a combined
function of the iron and non-ferrous metal contents of the initial
slag.

However, as shown in Figure 5, the residual cobalt content in
the cleaned slag, as a function of the iron content of the alloy,
is very sensitive to the initial cobalt content.

The major constituents of the alloys produced melt at rather high
temperatures, as shown in Table II.  The melting point of the
alloy increases sharply with iron content, and melting temperatures
in the range from 1300 to 1420&#176;C have been reported (2).
 This is one of the important determinants of a suitable operating
temperature for the furnace.  An operating temperature of 1500
to 1550&#176;C has been selected for the process, in accordance
with that used for a similar process (2).

<CENTER><B>DESCRIPTION OF A DC-ARC FURNACE<BR></B></CENTER>
<P>
The experimental work on the slag-cleaning process began on the
laboratory scale, and was extended to pilot scale on Mintek's
DC transferred-arc furnaces (8).  In addition to numerous 100&nbsp;kVA
(60&nbsp;kW) supporting batch tests, five campaigns (of 50 to
100 hours each) have been carried out at the 200&nbsp;kVA (150&nbsp;kW)
scale, and a campaign (treating about 20 t of slag) has also been
undertaken on the 3.2&nbsp;MVA (600&nbsp;kW) furnace.  Future
work is planned for the 5.6&nbsp;MVA (1-3&nbsp;MW) furnace facility.
<BR>

<P>
The DC-arc furnace has a single electrode positioned above the
molten bath; the molten metal in the furnace forms part (the anode)
of the electrical circuit.  The furnace comprises a refractory-lined
cylindrical steel shell, and a water-cooled roof lined with an
alumina refractory. The outer side walls of the furnace are spray-cooled
with water, to protect the refractories, and to promote the formation
of a freeze lining within the vessel. The roof contains the central
entry port for the graphite electrode and up to three equi-spaced
side feed ports.  The return electrode, or anode, consists of
multiple steel rods built into the hearth refractories and connected
at their lower end to a steel plate which, via radially extending
arms, is linked to the furnace shell, and further to the anode
cable.  A schematic diagram of this arrangement is shown in Figure
6.
<P>

a DC transferred-arc furnace<BR></CENTER>
<P>
Molten slag may be fed directly to the 5.6&nbsp;MVA furnace from
a pre-melting furnace.  The solid-feed system for the 3.2&nbsp;MVA
furnace comprises a batching plant and a final controlled feeding
system.  The batching plant consists of feed hoppers mounted on
load cells, vibratory feeders positioned under the hoppers, an
enclosed belt conveyor, a bucket elevator, and a pneumatically
actuated flap valve to direct the feed to one of two final feed
hoppers.  The final feeding system is made up of separate centre
and side feeding arrangements.  The centre feeder uses a screw
feeder discharging into a telescopic pipe attached to the hollow
graphite electrode.  The side feeders are vibratory, and discharge
into feed chutes.<BR>

<P>
The gas-cleaning system consists of a water-cooled off-gas pipe,
a refractory-lined combustion chamber, water-cooled ducting, a
forced-draft gas cooler, a reverse-pulse bag filter, a fan, and
a stack.  The condensed fume and dust, which accumulates in the
lower conical section of the bag plant, is discharged via a rotary
valve into a collecting drum.  This dust would, of course, be
recycled back to the furnace in an industrial situation.<BR>

slag having a composition of Co:&nbsp;0.46%, Cu:&nbsp;3.25%, Fe<SUB><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">total</FONT></SUB>:&nbsp;52%,
and Ni:&nbsp;0.42%.  A 100&nbsp;kVA furnace (operating at 20 to
25&nbsp;kW) was used.  In some tests, solid slag and coal were
fed together, while in others the slag was first melted then the
coal added afterwards.  Coal (at 53% fixed carbon) additions varied
between 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 per cent of the mass of the slag.
 The mode of addition of the coal, and the reduction periods of
the tests were also varied (around 30&nbsp;minutes).  The results
of the tests are shown in Table III and Figure 7.

The use of fine coal (less than 1.5&nbsp;mm) did not seem to have
an effect on the degree of reduction.  A representative composition

<P>
Using converter slag from a nickel-copper plant, tests were carried
out, in 1990, on a 100&nbsp;kVA furnace (operated at 30&nbsp;kW)
and on a 200&nbsp;kVA furnace (operated at 85&nbsp;kW), at low
additions of reductant (in order to minimize the reduction of
iron).  The slag had a composition of Co:&nbsp;0.45%, Cu:&nbsp;3%,
Fe<SUB>total</SUB>:&nbsp;47%,
Ni:&nbsp;3.5%, and S:&nbsp;3%.  These tests examined four different
methods of operation, in an attempt to optimize the selective
reduction of the slag.  These methods included smelting of composite
pellets of milled slag and graphite, adding selected quantities
of crushed coal to already molten slag, co-feeding crushed cold
slag and coal, and pneumatic injection of pulverized coal into
the molten slag. On the 100&nbsp;kVA furnace, the alloy produced
typically comprised Co:&nbsp;1.7%, Cu:&nbsp;14%, Fe:&nbsp;48%,
Ni:&nbsp;16%, and S:&nbsp;14%.  On the 200&nbsp;kVA furnace, an
alloy of Co:&nbsp;2%, Cu:&nbsp;15%, Fe:&nbsp;44%, Ni:&nbsp;22%,
and S:&nbsp;10% was produced.  At this level of reduction, 91%
of the iron was retained in the slag phase, while only 50% of
the cobalt, 63% of the copper, and 83% of the nickel were recovered
to the alloy.  It was found that injection of pulverized coal
greatly improved the reduction, and hence the recovery, of nickel
and cobalt oxides from the slag.  The results of these tests are
shown in Figure 8, where the scatter of results needs to be seen
in the context of the various methods employed.  Under good conditions,
at 7% carbon addition, on the 100&nbsp;kVA furnace, calculated
recoveries of Co:&nbsp;81%, Cu:&nbsp;78%, and Ni:&nbsp;97% were
obtained, while retaining 80% of the iron in the slag.

This slag was generated in a plant utilizing a conventional six-in-line
furnace and Peirce-Smith converter configuration.  The composition
of the bulk slag was Co:&nbsp;1.25%, Cu:&nbsp;1.0%, Fe<SUB>total</SUB>:&nbsp;49%,
Ni:&nbsp;3.6%, and SiO<SUB>2</SUB>:&nbsp;30%.  During testwork
carried out in 1993, the furnace was operated at power levels
of 100 to 170&nbsp;kW and tapping temperatures of 1400 to 1500&#176;C.
 The alloys produced comprised Co:&nbsp;4.5 to 5.5%, Cu:&nbsp;5.5
to 8.5%, Ni:&nbsp;25 to 35%, Fe:&nbsp;35 to 50%, and S:&nbsp;8
to 10%.  From the starting level of 1.25% cobalt in the feed slag,
it was possible to produce a discard slag with typical values
of 0.22 to 0.29% cobalt.  Results from the campaign are summarized
in Figure 9.

<P>
Co-feeding of the coal and sequential feeding (addition of coal
to a molten slag bath) gave similar recoveries to the alloy of
74 and 80% respectively.  While cobalt recoveries were similar,
sequential feeding (the preferred route for an industrial plant
where molten slag is available) produces a better grade of alloy,
with an iron content in the region of 10 to 15% lower.<BR>

<P>
The most abundant phase present in the solid converter slag is
Fe<SUB>2</SUB>SiO<SUB>4</SUB> (olivine), followed by Fe<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>4</SUB>
(spinel).  The cobalt is associated primarily with the olivine,
whereas the nickel is distributed between the olivine and the
spinel.  Copper was present only in entrained sulphides.  The
analysis of highly reduced slags has shown that it is possible
to remove virtually all of the cobalt and nickel from the olivine
in the slag.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>Nickel-copper converter slag 'B' - 3.2&nbsp;MVA<BR></B></U>
<P>
Large-scale testwork on converter slag was conducted, during 1994,
on a 3.2&nbsp;MVA DC-arc furnace operating at a power level of
600&nbsp;kW.  The sequential feeding of reductant was used as
the preferred mode of feeding.  Operating temperatures were in
the region of 1300 to 1600<SUP>&#176;</SUP>C, and neither the
temperature of the bath before the reduction period nor the tapping
temperature seemed to have a pronounced effect on the cobalt recovery.
 <BR>

<P>
The average electrode consumption during the campaign was 2.6&nbsp;kg/MWh,
while the dust loss was low, at 1% of the mass of the feed.  The
alloy produced comprised Co:&nbsp;7.8%, Cu:&nbsp;3.8%, Ni:&nbsp;26.4%,
Fe:&nbsp;56.9%, and S:&nbsp;2.1%.  The cobalt levels achieved
in the discard slag were between 0.15 and 0.33%.<BR>

<P>
A coal addition of 9% was required to achieve cobalt recoveries
of at least 80%.  Increasing the coal addition did not significantly
increase the recovery of cobalt.  Increasing the batch mass of
slag from 500 kg to 1000 kg and increasing the reduction period
by 75% resulted in increases in cobalt recovery from 71 to 86%,
and from 70 to 82%, for coal additions of 9 and 11% respectively.
 The main factor affecting cobalt recovery appears to be the time
allowed for the reduction to take place.  At this scale of operation,
a duration of two hours was required to achieve cobalt recoveries
greater than 80%.<BR>

<U><B>Nickel-copper furnace and converter slag -200&nbsp;kVA<BR></B></U>
<P>
During 1995, a campaign was undertaken on the 200&nbsp;kVA furnace
with the intention of combining furnace slag with the converter
slag previously treated.  When treating furnace slag containing
0.22% Co on its own, the maximum cobalt recovery that could be
obtained was 66%, with a cobalt value of 0.08% in the discard
slag.  As in previous testwork, the cobalt in the discard slag
when treating converter slag on its own was still in the region
of 0.22%.  However, by combining increasing amounts of furnace
slag with converter slag, values approaching 0.08% Co in the discard
slag could still be achieved.  This resulted in cobalt recoveries
approaching 90% being attained, while the average recovery was
in the region of 85%.<BR>

<P>
During 1995, a campaign was conducted on Mintek's 200&nbsp;kVA
DC-arc furnace to recover cobalt from copper reverberatory furnace
slag (initially containing Co:0.77% and Cu:1.3%).  Alloys containing
Co:&nbsp;6-7%, Cu:&nbsp;9-11%, Fe:&nbsp;77-78%, and S:&nbsp;2-3%
were produced, leaving slags containing Co:&nbsp;0.08-0.16% and
Cu:&nbsp;0.18-0.29%.  Coal additions of 4 per cent of the mass
of the slag fed, and residence times of one to two hours, gave
cobalt recoveries ranging from 77 to 91%.  Tapping temperatures
of 1490-1560&#176;C were attained.  As shown in Figure 9, the
cobalt level in the slag (and therefore the cobalt recovery) varied
according to the residence time in the furnace.  A retention time
of 2 hours was required to achieve cobalt recoveries in the region
of 90%.
<P>

<BR></CENTER>
<P>
During this campaign, the dust loss was 0.7 per cent of the mass
of feed slag.  The electrode consumption was 1.0&nbsp;kg/MWh.
The slag resistivity was calculated to be 1.1&nbsp;cm. Measurements
were also made of the arc characteristics.  The melting point
of the alloy produced in the furnace was 1340&#176;C, as determined
by differential thermal analysis.<BR>

<P>
Some of the alloy was upgraded by blowing with oxygen in a top-blown
rotary converter (TBRC), preferentially oxidizing the iron, and
thereby concentrating the cobalt and copper in the alloy.  The
iron content in the alloy was lowered from 76 to 25%, with the
effect that the alloy was concentrated up to 30% cobalt and 40%
copper.  The sulphur level in the resulting alloy was 0.8%.  This
means that 75% of the cobalt remained in the alloy, while 90%
of the iron was removed to the slag.  The slag from the TBRC would,
of course, be recycled back to the DC-arc furnace, in order to
prevent the blown cobalt from being lost.<BR>

<P>
In the case of copper reverberatory furnace slag, mineralogical
studies showed that the cobalt is present as CoO.  Copper in the
slag is mainly attributed to the presence of copper-rich sulphides.
 The cobalt oxide, and, to a lesser extent, the copper oxide associated
with the silicate / oxide phases, is reduced by Fe from the alloy
to form metallic Co (and Cu), resulting in the formation of FeO
in the slag.  Given that this reaction occurs between the metal
bath and the overlying slag, the exchange of Co and Cu with Fe
will take place only at the slag/metal interface.  Improved recoveries
of valuable metals can be achieved by allowing greater quantities
of slag to come into contact with the alloy (by mild stirring,
for example), and increasing the length of the contact time between
slag and metal.  The CoO in the slag is associated primarily with
Fe<SUB>2</SUB>SiO<SUB>4</SUB>, and analysis by scanning electron
microscopy showed some Fe<SUB>2</SUB>SiO<SUB>4</SUB> particles
with no detectable Co or Cu, thus demonstrating that it is, in
principle, possible to remove all the Co and Cu from this phase.
<BR>

<P>
The low concentrations of Co found in the sulphide phases of the
alloy indicate that the possible reaction of CoO + FeS  CoS +
FeO is not significant for the cobalt in this system.  (This reaction
might, of course, be more significant in systems where the sulphur
content of the alloy approaches that of a matte.)<BR>

<P>
Copper sulphide and copper metal (with its inherent cobalt content),
because of their higher densities and immiscibility with the slag,
settle from the molten slag into the metal bath.  Improving recoveries
via this mechanism would involve decreasing the viscosity of the
slag (by increased temperature or flux additions), and / or increasing
the settling time to allow smaller droplets to fall.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>BENEFITS OF DC-ARC FURNACES<BR></B></CENTER>
<P>
The question might well be asked as to why a DC-arc furnace should
perform better than an AC slag-resistance furnace for this type
of process.  There are a number of reasons for this.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>Metallurgical flexibility because of independent power supply
<BR></B></U>
<P>
Since DC-arc furnaces operate under open arc conditions with the
electrode positioned above the bath, they do not rely very much
on the resistivity of the slag in order to supply energy to the
furnace bath.  This renders the energy supply nearly independent
of slag composition, which allows the slag chemistry to be optimized
for the best recovery of valuable metals (instead of for the required
electrical characteristics).  When this type of process is operated
in an AC slag-resistance furnace, the degree of reduction cannot
readily be controlled, because the electrodes are immersed in
the slag, and alloys with high iron contents (relative to the
amount of cobalt reduced) result (2,3).<BR>

<P>
<U><B>Temperature control<BR></B></U>
<P>
As the current flowing in a DC-arc furnace has to travel through
the entire depth of the liquid bath (as opposed to merely between
the electrodes of an AC furnace), the temperature distribution
is more likely to be relatively even. This is very important for
determining factors such as slag viscosity (which is very temperature-sensitive)
and density, which play a significant role in allowing the efficient
settling of the droplets of alloy.  Furthermore, it is possible
to achieve a specified power input, almost without regard to the
temperature of the slag.  This is in marked contrast to the case
of an AC furnace, where, as the slag gets hotter, the conductivity
increases, thereby limiting the amount of energy which can be
dissipated in the slag by the mechanism of resistive heating.
 This fact limits the temperature that can be obtained in a submerged-electrode
or slag-resistance AC furnace.  Furthermore, the high iron oxide
content, of iron-silicate converter slags in particular, results
in high electrical conductivity (9) which does not permit effective
energy generation in the melt when using a slag-resistance furnace.
<P>
<U><B>Stable operation<BR></B></U>
<P>
The inherent stability of a DC arc offers the potential for improved
operational control.  In an AC furnace, conditions under one electrode
affect the currents in the other two electrodes. In the slag-cleaning
process considered here, the furnace would be operated with a
layer of electrically conductive coke or coal covering the slag.
 As the electrodes of the AC furnace penetrate this layer, there
exists the possibility of the current flowing between the electrodes
on the surface of the slag.  This inter-electrode conduction not
only reduces the energy dissipated in the slag layer, but would
also result in difficulty in controlling electrode penetration
of the slag.<BR>

<P>
Because of the difficulty of controlling the position of AC electrodes,
there are often large imbalances in the power distribution.  This
results in hot zones, which reduce the freeze-line of solidified
slag near the dissipating electrodes, exposing the refractories
to slag attack.  With a closely controlled single electrode, the
freeze-lining on a DC-arc furnace can be better maintained, thus
significantly reducing the slag attack on the refractories.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>Electrode consumption and maintenance<BR></B></U>
<P>
AC furnaces used for slag cleaning are usually resistively heated
three-phase three-electrode furnaces, where the electrodes are
in contact with the slag.  Unavoidably, the electrodes are attacked
by the highly aggressive slag.  Furthermore, electrodes carrying
AC current suffer from the 'skin effect', where most of the electrode
current is forced to a narrow outer band of the electrode, thereby
reducing the electrode's current-carrying capacity.  As a consequence
of this, the electrodes have to be larger, thereby exposing an
even greater surface to the reactive slag.  The DC-arc furnace
used for slag cleaning operates under open-arc conditions, with
the electrode tip removed from contact with the aggressive slag.
 DC electrode current also eliminates the 'skin effect', allowing
a greater current loading (A/cm<SUP>2</SUP>) of the electrode.
 This phenomenon, added to the fact that there is only one instead
of three electrodes, results in a much smaller electrode erosion
area.  These design considerations result in a significantly lower
electrode consumption, anticipated to be around 1 to 3&nbsp;kg/MWh.
 Since the electrodes do not react with the slag, the reductant
addition and consumption can be controlled accurately.<BR>

<P>
Because of the interactive nature of the electrodes in a three-phase
furnace, a loss of power on one electrode will inevitably result
is a loss of power in the other two.  The problem is particularly
prevalent when S&ouml;derberg-type electrodes are used, because
such electrodes are prone to breakages, and also need to be baked
in at low current (and hence low power) for extended periods of
time after an upset.  Losses of around 1% of total plant production
are typically due to this type of problem.<BR>

<P>
AC furnaces with S&ouml;derberg-type electrodes are cumbersome
to maintain, since electrode casings continually need to be welded
to the three electrode columns, and the paste level in the electrodes
monitored and maintained.  On a DC furnace, one electrode section
simply needs to be screwed on to the column at regular intervals
(although this renders the furnace unavailable during the short
power-off down-time).<BR>

<P>
<U><B>Structural benefits<BR></B></U>
<P>
Because it has only one electrode to support, the superstructure
of a DC-arc furnace is a lot simpler and cheaper than that required
for a three-electrode AC furnace.  The transformer and rectifier
can be placed away from the superstructure, in a convenient location.
 Because there is only one electrode, there is room on the roof
to accommodate the suitable positioning of feed chutes to allow
the feeding of coke (or coal) directly onto the slag entering
through the melt inlet.  This facilitates good mixing between
the slag and reductant.  It is simpler to perform maintenance
above a DC furnace electrode, since there is less electrode clutter
above the roof.  The gas seal on a DC furnace is better, as only
one electrode seal, instead of three, is used.  There is also
usually less electrode movement, as the arc is more stable, and
the electrode is not interacting with others.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>Electrical power supply<BR></B></U>
<P>
The new generation of DC power supplies specifically addresses
the problems of harmonics and flicker associated with AC power
supplies.  For example, the Robicon power supply uses a 24-pulse
rectification system with an output chopped at a frequency of
1&nbsp;kHz, and conforms to the IEEE&nbsp;519 specification for
both voltage and current distortion.  This eliminates the need
for costly harmonic filters, or for flicker-reducing static VAR
compensators.  An added benefit of the new-generation DC power
supply is the fact that it is designed to provide low-reactance
power at a power factor of 0.95 or better throughout the required
voltage range, thereby reducing the transformer size and MVA demand,
and eliminating the cost of any external power factor correction.
<BR>

<P>
In some DC-arc furnaces operating at high voltages (and hence
with long arcs) or high process temperatures, problems have been
experienced with uncontrolled or 'stray' arcing between the electrode
and the roof or refractories, resulting in damage to the roof
(and water leaks in the case of a water-cooled roof).  With a
suitable roof design, and by maximizing the current / voltage
capability of the power supply, the arc length can be reduced,
and stray arcing minimized.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>PROCESS OPTIMIZATION<BR></B></CENTER>
<P>
There are many aspects to the recovery process, and many of these
can be tailored specifically to the particular material being
treated.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>Upgrading of cobalt-rich iron alloys<BR></B></U>
<P>
It is possible to upgrade the alloys produced in the DC-arc reduction
process by the selective oxidation of iron (2,10).  Figure 10
shows the flow of material streams in a process that allows the
upgrading of cobalt-rich iron alloys.  If the DC-arc furnace is
run under strongly reducing conditions (to ensure the greatest
possible recovery of valuable metals), the alloy will contain
a large quantity of iron.  However, if this alloy is subjected
to a blowing stage (using air or oxygen), much of the iron can
be eliminated into a slag phase.  Typically, a silica flux is
added in order to combine with the resulting iron oxide to form
a fayalitic slag (nominally 2FeO.SiO<SUB>2</SUB>).  This blowing
stage can be carried out in a converter of some kind, or even
in a closed furnace utilising a submerged top lance.  Tests at
Mintek have been done using a top-blown rotary converter (TBRC).
 The slag from the upgrading step would be recycled back to the
DC-arc furnace at industrial scale, in order to recover the portion
of valuable metals that have been re-oxidized.  It is possible
to arrange conditions in the two process units such that an alloy
containing only 30% iron is produced, even though a cobalt recovery
of 80% is achieved.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Cobalt11.gif" ALT=""></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>Figure 11 - Flowsheet for DC-arc slag cleaning, with an
upgrading step, using a top-blown rotary converter (TBRC), for
example<BR></CENTER>
<P>
Objections to having a converter in the process usually revolve
around the loss of sulphur to the atmosphere.  Most modern non-ferrous
smelters are moving away from Peirce-Smith converters for just
that reason.  However, there is a vast difference between the
conversion of a high-sulphur matte and the blowing of an iron-rich
alloy.  The small quantity of sulphur present in the alloy (a
small fraction of a per cent of the incoming sulphur from the
concentrate to the smelter) is moderately tightly bound to the
metallic elements, and is not too readily given up to the gas
phase.  Furthermore, the gas stream is only a waste product from
a secondary stream  much smaller than the main stream, and the
very small quantity of sulphur in the gas could be scrubbed. 
If this is still seen to be a problem, a stationary enclosed vessel,
such as those used by the new generation of submerged-lance systems,
should be investigated for their suitability to the task.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>Kinetics / mass transfer<BR></B></U>
<P>
The gas injection of solid reductant has been found to increase
reaction and mass transfer rates.  Stirring (using nitrogen injection,
for example) can also be employed in order to improve the mass
transfer particularly between slag and reductant.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>Lime addition<BR></B></U>
<P>
The addition of CaO (up to a certain point) decreases the cobalt
and copper content of slags (9).  The activity coefficients of
the valuable metal oxides are increased by the addition of CaO.
 In addition, the viscosity of the slag decreases as the slag
becomes more basic (e.g. by the addition of CaO or MgO).  This
is important for slag-metal reaction kinetics, and for the settling
behaviour of metal droplets.  The liquidus temperature of the
slag also decreases (to a minimum value) with increasing content
of CaO.<BR>

<P>
 It has been found (2) that the kinetics of reduction (for copper
converter slag) are enhanced by the addition of lime, and good
recoveries could be obtained in a one hour reduction period. 
It should also be mentioned that the addition of silica and magnesia
can raise the liquidus temperature, thereby reducing the degree
of attack on the furnace refractory lining.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>Recovery of platinum group metals<BR></B></U>
<P>
The platinum group metals (PGMs) are often found together with
nickel, copper, and cobalt sulphide deposits.  Even in small quantities,
these can be economically significant.  The PGMs follow the nickel,
copper, and iron through the pyrometallurgical process, and can
be extracted from the hydrometallurgical leach residues for further
processing.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>Water atomization of alloys<BR></B></U>
<P>
Cobalt-rich iron alloys are virtually unbreakable, which poses
a problem of delivery of the alloy to the downstream process units.
 It is common practice in a number of slag-cleaning processes
to add sulphur (in the form of pyrite, concentrate, or matte)
to the alloy, in order to make it sufficiently brittle to be able
to be successfully milled after granulation.  Apart from the inconvenience
and expense of having to add this material to the furnace, this
sulphur needs to be removed during subsequent hydrometallurgical
processing.<BR>

<P>
Water atomization, involving the 'smashing' of a stream of molten
alloy with a high-pressure stream of water, can directly produce
fine particles of alloy with a mean diameter of less than 100&nbsp;&#181;m
(even as small as 40&nbsp;&#181;m).  The design of the atomizing
system is simplified by not having any tight constraints on the
range of particle sizes and shapes of the particles.  Small-scale
experiments have been carried out successfully on 5&nbsp;kg batches
of alloy.  This technology is commercially available up to industrial
scale, and appears to be very cost-effective when compared to
the option of granulation and milling.  This step introduces another
level of flexibility into the process; one can now optimize the
metallurgy to maximize recovery of the valuable metals, without
needing to be too concerned with the physical properties of the
alloy.<BR>

<P>
Very little material handling is required after atomization. 
A simple screen to separate oversize materials (for recycling
to the DC-arc furnace) is about all that is needed.  The alloy
particles can be pumped as a slurry, then de-watered.  Drying
is not necessary, as the alloy will next be subjected to a wet
process.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>Downstream hydrometallurgical processing<BR></B></U>
<P>
The alloy produced in the reduction process can be leached with
spent electrolyte from a copper or nickel electrowinning process.
 Mintek has developed a leaching process that solubilizes the
nickel, copper, and cobalt, while rejecting the iron and any sulphur
into the solid residue (by decreasing the pH appropriately). 
The resulting solution can be processed further to separate the
cobalt, nickel, and copper from each other via conventional technology.
 Mintek has also developed direct solvent extraction of cobalt
from cobalt-bearing nickel solutions.  Nickel and cobalt have
been successfully electrowon from the raffinate and strip liquor
respectively.<BR>

<CENTER><B>CONCLUSION<BR></B></CENTER>
<P>
DC-arc furnace technology has been successfully applied to the
recovery of cobalt, nickel, and copper from non-ferrous furnace
and converter slags. Pilot-plant testwork at Mintek has demonstrated
recoveries of 98% for nickel and over 80% for cobalt, at power
levels of up to 600&nbsp;kW.<BR>

<P>
Mintek expects to participate in the commissioning of the first
commercial units during 1998, and is currently involved with several
engineering companies on final feasibility studies.  Mintek intends
to offer this patented technology (11) for implementation world-wide,
and to play an active role in the design, supply, and commissioning
of suitable DC-arc furnaces to meet clients' needs.<BR>

<BR CLEAR=left>
<H2>The TBRC is a tilting, rotary furnace equipped with an oxygen-propane lance</H2>
<BR>
<H3>It has the following benefits: </H3>
<UL>
	<LI>The rotation of the vessel improves heat transfer, and accelerates the reactions involved in refining and smelting processes. 
	<LI>Oxygen-propane combustion produces an intense, stable and compact flame with very efficient heat transfer capabilities and low exhaust volume flow. 
	<LI>Oxygen and fuel ratios can be controlled over a wide range to produce reducing, neutral or oxidizing conditions. 
	<LI>The precision tilting facility promotes good slag-metal separation and easy charging. 
	<LI>The absence of submerged lances and tuyeres increases shell life and simplifies operating procedures. 
</UL>

<P>
<H3>Because of its versatility, the TBRC has a wide range of applications </H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Matte blowing. 
	<LI>Pre-melting. 
	<LI>Reductive and/or flux smelting of metal ores. 
	<LI>Oxidative and/or flux smelting for removal of base metals (lead, copper, zinc, etc.). 
	<LI>Detoxification of flue dust, e.g. removal of arsenic. 
	<LI>Dehalogenation of electric arc furnace dust (removal of  chlorine and fluorine). 
	<LI>Processing of anode slimes from electrolytic refining. 
	<LI>Fuming reactions for antimony, bismuth, etc. 
</UL>
<P>
<H3>The TBRC can be divided into the following sub-systems</H3>

<IMG ALIGN=left,center SRC="BlueDot.gif"><B><I>Vessel, frame, hydraulic cylinders and variable speed geared motor </B></I><BR>
The vessel consists of a mild-steel flanged cylinder with a length of 585&nbsp;mm and a diameter of 600&nbsp;mm.  A mild-steel cone tapering from 600&nbsp;mm to 430&nbsp;mm is bolted onto the top flange.  A mild-steel base-plate with a diameter of 600&nbsp;mm is bolted to the base flange of the vessel.
<P>
The drive shaft is bolted to the base-plate, and located by a plumber block bolted to the furnace support frame at an angle of 30 to the horizontal.  This frame is supported by the upright cradle arms.
<P>
The vessel is lined with 500&nbsp;kg of chrome-magnesite castable.  The wall thickness of the refractory at the base of the vessel is 150&nbsp;mm, and at the sides, 138&nbsp;mm.
<P>
A 25-teeth sprocket is bolted to the drive shaft, and a 25,4&nbsp;mm pitch single chain connects it to a 17-teeth sprocket, which forms part of the variable speed geared motor.  The motor has an output of 0.37&nbsp;kW, and can rotate the vessel at a minimum of 2&nbsp;r/min and at a maximum of 11&nbsp;rmin.
<P>
The vessel is tilted by two hydraulic pistons fastened to the vessel's frame at one end and the mainframe at the other.  When the hydraulics are activated, the arms lift the frame upwards allowing the vessel's contents  to pour into a ladle.
<P>
<BR>
<IMG ALIGN=left,center SRC="BlueDot.gif"><B><I>Lance</B></I><BR>

The lance has a power rating of 120&nbsp;kW maximum and turn down to 20&nbsp;kW.  It is 1.2&nbsp;m long, and consists of four concentric stainless-steel pipes with diameters of 10, 20, 30 and 50&nbsp;mm.
<P>
The 10&nbsp;mm pipe carries the propane while the annulus surrounding it, formed by the 20&nbsp;mm pipe, carries the oxygen.  Because the oxygen flows through an open annulus, only low line pressure is required.  The 20, 30 and 50&nbsp;mm diameter pipes form the jacket, with the inlet water flowing through the 30&nbsp;mm inner pipe and out through the 50&nbsp;mm pipe.

<A NAME="Introduction">
<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
Welcome to the Pyrosim user's manual. This manual discusses the features available in Pyrosim version 1.50.

<P>
Pyrosim is a pyrometallurgical process simulation package which can be configured to simulate many different high temperature metallurgical operations. Designed as a process simulator, it has nevertheless also been used to simulate other systems, e.g. high temperature fusion and cupellation during platinum group metal chemical analysis, and the chemical interaction between a refractory brick and a molten metal bath.

<P>
Recently Pyrosim and Thermo (both developed by Rodney Jones) have now evolved into a suite of products. Pyrosim is most suited to study complex systems, while Thermo allows compounds and single reactions to be rapidly analysed. Thermodynamic data can now be edited in Thermo and exported to Pyrosim. Thermo is not documented in this manual. However explanation will be given for situations where data is exported from Thermo to Pyrosim.

<P>
The most significant new feature in Pyrosim is the generalised empirical mode; this is designed to replace the non-equilibrium stainless steel models. The new empirical model is believed to be a powerful new feature which is afforded the same generality incorporated in the equilibrium model.

<P>
<A NAME="Pyrosim Documentation">
<B><U>Pyrosim Documentation</U></B><BR>
This manual has been separated into a number of sections: Chapter 1 describes installation and getting started; Chapter 2: YOUR FIRST PYROSIM MODEL; Chapter 3 discusses some advanced features, and lists some of the less obvious aspects of Pyrosim.

<P>
Rodney Jones' Masters thesis contains a rigorous treatment of the mathematics and thermodynamics used in Pyrosim. Copies of this thesis can be purchased from Mintek, on request.

<A NAME="Hardware requirements">
<B><U>Hardware requirements</U></B><BR>
Pyrosim runs under the MSDOS operating system (DOS 2.x or higher). 640 kb RAM is recommended and, because, Pyrosim is numerically intensive, it is recommended that you use a 80386 processor or higher with a maths co-processor.

<P>
<A NAME="Installation">
<B><U>Installation</U></B><BR>
Pyrosim is supplied on two 5&#188;" floppy disks or on one 3&#189;" floppy disk, and is intended for use on a hard disk. Installation is done by copying all files from the floppy disks to a directory called C:\PYROSIM (or any other name you prefer). The program is then run from this directory, by typing <I>PYROSIM</I>. If you would like to develop a unique model you will first have to select the relevant species using Pyromake or Thermo.

<P>
<A NAME="#Running Pyrosim Under Microsoft Windows">
<B><U>Running Pyrosim Under Microsoft Windows&#169; </U></B><BR>
Pyrosim can be configured to run in a DOS shell under Windows. Pyrosim run time errors are not common, however Windows sometimes crashes for no apparent reason. The preferred way to run Pyrosim is from DOS.
<P>
Pyrosim runs well in a Dos window under Microsoft Windows 95.
<P>
Windows 3.1 can slow Pyrosim's execution but this depends on the foreground and background settings in your Pif Editor. Multitasking is not recommended.
<P>
Pyrosim has been found to run acceptably under Windows NT&#169;.

<P>
<A NAME="Customisation">
<B><U>Customisation</U></B><BR>
If you are using a computer with a monochrome screen, start the program by typing <I>PYROSIM /BW</I>.
<P>
The first time the program is used, select the option <B>S</B>etup/<B>P</B>rinter to specify the type of printer you have connected.
<P>
At a later stage, when you have a number of established models, you can make Pyrosim directly select a particular system by typing the three-character identifier as part of the command line. For example, to run Pyrosim using the *.EXT system (EXT is your own extension), you should type <I>PYROSIM .EXT</I> at the DOS prompt.

<P>
<A NAME="The Stainless Steel System">
<B><U>The "Stainless Steel" System</U></B><BR>
Included with the program is a self-contained system specifically for use in the Fe-Cr system. These models have been included for backward compatibility and are no longer supported. If you intend modelling a stainless steel operation you should rather set up your own models from scratch (using the instructions which follow).

<P>
<A NAME="Pyrosim Models on a Diskette">
<B><U>Pyrosim Models on a Diskette</U></B><BR>
If you have Pyrosim data files on a floppy/stiffy you can use one of the following options to run your Pyrosim files. The following points assume that you already have Pyrosim installed on the new computer.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Copy your files into the Pyrosim directory of the computer.
</UL>
<FONT COLOR=red><B>&#215;</B> Note that if the extension of the files in drive B is the same as another model's on your hard disk you will overwrite the files with the same extension in the hard drive. </FONT>
<UL>
<LI>If you have a ram drive configured you can copy the files to this drive and run Pyrosim by typing <I>C:\PYROSIM\PYROSIM</I>.
</UL>
<FONT COLOR=blue><B>&#164;</B> Don't forget to make a backup if you make significant changes to the model in the ram drive. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=red><B>&#215;</B> The ram drive is temporary, if the power fails all is lost. </FONT>
<UL>
<LI>Run Pyrosim from your diskette (by typing <I>C:\PYROSIM\PYROSIM</I> at the DOS prompt).

Before you begin, note that the <B>F10</B> key is used throughout the program as the acceptance key; it is used once you have edited or chosen an option and would like to proceed. <B>Esc</B> allows you to escape from an operation without implementing any changes.
<P>
Pyrosim should now be installed in a directory C:\PYROSIM, as described in the <A HREF="ManCh1.htm">previous section</A>.

<P>
<A NAME="Selecting thermodynamic data">
<B><U>Selecting thermodynamic data from Thermo</U></B><BR>
Thermo is a thermodynamic package used to evaluate individual chemical reactions. Thermo (version 2.09 or higher) can also be used to edit and export thermodynamic data for use by Pyrosim.
<P>
Thermo should be installed in a directory C:\THERMO. Type Thermo at the C:\THERMO prompt and select eXport from the main menu. Select the species which you would like to use in your system by pressing enter (which toggles the selection).
Using the elements present as a guide you should select most of the species which contain combinations of the elements present, for example if you have Fe, Ca, Mg, and O as elements present you should select all the iron oxides, calcium oxides, magnesium oxides, and complex species like Ca<SUB>2</SUB>Fe<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB>, CaFe<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB>, and MgFe<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>4</SUB> species.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Man01.gif" WIDTH=565 HEIGHT=280 ALT="Figure1"></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Figure 1: The Thermo eXport screen</FONT>
<P>
Don't forget to include gaseous species and all the species present in the feed materials of your process.
<P>
Once you have made your selection press <B>F10</B>. The default directory for Pyrosim files is C:\PYROSIM, however, you may edit the default if you wish. Choose a three character identifier and press enter. Thermo will affirm that the data has been sucessfully exported in a Pyrosim format.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Man02.gif" WIDTH=565 HEIGHT=280 ALT="Figure2"></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Figure 2: Exiting Thermo</FONT>
<P>
If you missed a species you can run Thermo at a later date and add the species to the list. To do this just select the species, and choose the same three character identifier. A message will appear stating that a list with that identifier already exists, press enter to continue. Thermo will append the new species to the bottom of the list.

<P>
<A NAME="Using Pyromake">
<B><U>Using the Pyromake Utility Program</U></B><BR>
Pyromake is a simple utility to automate the process of gathering thermodynamic data for the initial creation of a set of Pyrosim data files for a particular system. Thermo version 2.09 can now export data in the Pyrosim format, and also add to Pyrosim data files. It is strongly recommended that you use Thermo to manipulate thermodynamic data, if however you do not have Thermo, read on.
<P>
All that is involved in using Pyromake is the selection of all species of interest, and the specification of where the files are to be created. A three-character identifier for the set of data files is also required.
<P>
To begin constructing a new model use the cursor keys to move around, and press Enter to select a compound.
<P>
Select the following compounds:
<UL>
<LI>Compounds present in any feed material.
<LI>All compounds that may leave the process as products.
<LI>Any complex compound that may account for non-ideal interactions between simple compounds
<LI>Any other compound that may be required in your model
</UL>
Bear in mind that this list forms the basis of a simulation model, and that all feed streams and equilibrium or empirical specifications will be selected from this list.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=blue><B>&#164;</B> A rule of thumb to follow when setting up a system is to choose any possible combination of the elements present in the feed streams.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=red><B>&#215;</B> However, try not to select too long a list, as the memory which Pyrosim uses (the lower 640 kb block) is limited; long lists may result in an Error 7: Out of Memory when you run Pyrosim.</FONT>
<P>
It is crucial to not leave out any species at this stage because, if, at a later stage, you realise that a species is missing you will have to edit your thermodynamic file. This operation is most easily overcome by using Thermo, but editing and adding of thermodynamic data can be performed by running an older version of Pyrosim (called PYRO143.EXE) with your system.
<P>
Once you have made your selection press <B>F10</B>. A prompt appears requesting the destination of the Pyrosim files (which Pyromake will automatically create). The default destination is C:>PYROSIM). Choose the default unless the directory into which the files are to be placed is another which already exists. If the directory does not exist an Error 76: "Path not found" will be reported and the Pyromake file will have to be recreated.
<P>
Enter a three character identifier for your system (and <B>F10</B> to accept). Once you return to the DOS prompt type <I>PYROSIM .EXT</I>, (where EXT is your three character identifier), or just <I>PYROSIM</I>.
<P>
<B>&#134;</B> A directory listing of files in the PYROSIM directory will show you that a file THERMDAT.EXT has been created from the file THERMO.DAT ( EXT is the three character extension you gave your system). The files ending in SS are files set up for the stainless steel system.

<P>
<A NAME="Selecting a System">
<B><U>Selecting a System</U></B><BR>
Once you have constructed the database for your system you will need to run Pyrosim. After typing <I>PYROSIM</I> at the DOS prompt a data set menu, similar to the one displayed below, will appear.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Man03.gif" WIDTH=565 HEIGHT=280 ALT="Figure3"></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Figure 3: Pyrosim's data set menu that allows for the selection of any predefined system</FONT>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>To select a user defined system move to the desired system and press Enter (all the systems stored in the PYROSIM directory are listed in this menu).
<LI>To select the stainless steel system do so from the data set menu as shown above.
</UL>
Pyrosim's Main menu is shown below.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Man04.gif" WIDTH=565 HEIGHT=280 ALT="Figure4"></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Figure 4: The Main menu</FONT>
<P>
Basic configuration of your system can be performed from this menu.
<P>
The following sections describe these basic operations. The next chapter discusses advanced features that are either command line instructions or require specific characters for initialisation.

<P>
<A NAME="Choosing a Flow Sheet">
<B><U>Choosing a Process Flow Sheet</U></B><BR>
The flow sheet should contain all the relevant units of the pyrometallurgical stages to be modelled. Pyrosim allows four process models to be connected within a system.
<P>
Select option f<B>L</B>owheet from the main menu to configure your system. If a two stage model is to be used the following screen will be displayed.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Man05.gif" WIDTH=565 HEIGHT=280 ALT="Figure5"></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Figure 5: Screen display for f<B>L</B>owsheet/Flowsheet 2</FONT>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The interconnections shown at this stage are purely graphical. Until the interconnections between units are specified (Interconnect) no mass flow between units will be reported in the output.
</UL>
<FONT COLOR=red><B>&#215;</B> If you have developed a multi-unit process and wish to revert to a single stage process you must reset the output format. This is done in the main menu, after a single stage unit has been selected, by moving the cursor to the Interconnect command and pressing enter.</FONT>

<P>
<A NAME="Choosing a Model">
<B><U>Choosing a Model</U></B><BR>
A number of user definable process models are available. The most frequently used models are the user definable Equilibrium model, and the Heater / Drier. The Empirical model (for performing mass balances) is also becoming more widely used.
<P>
Pyrosim was originally developed as a means of simulating the production of crude stainless steel, as described by Rodney Jones1. The original models were developed exclusively for this process however the Stainless Steel models are rarely used; current techniques for describing a mixed phase result in better predictions.
<P>
The following sections describe the individual unit models. To select a model use the <B>M</B>odels option from the main menu. The Stainless Steel system is described in <A HREF="ManAppB.htm">Appendix B</A>.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Man06.gif" WIDTH=565 HEIGHT=280 ALT="Figure6"></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Figure 6: Models option from the main menu; the cursor keys can be used to scroll through the list</FONT>
<P>
<A NAME="Heater / Drier">
<B><U>Heater / Drier</U></B><BR>
The Heater / Drier model can be used in two configurations, temperature controlled and energy controlled.
<UL>
<LI>As a <B>temperature controlled</B> unit. This is a heater, with Pyrosim calculating the energy requirements. The feed materials are all heated to the specified temperature, and the user can specify a percentage of moisture and volatiles to be removed.
<LI>All other species that occur as gases at the operating temperature report to the gas phase.
<LI>Combustion is not taken into account in this model.
<LI>As an <B>energy controlled</B> unit: This model balances the energy of the feed and product streams (by changing the unit's operating temperature) and predicts a bulk temperature for the unit. For example a hot off-gas stream drying the feed to a furnace. The temperature of the unit would be determined by the enthalpy of the streams entering the unit (and the heat losses of the unit).
<LI>The user is prompted for an approximate temperature of the unit to act as a first estimate in the solve routine.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="The Equilibrium Model">
<B><U>The Equilibrium Model</U></B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>This model allows any equilibrium specification to be made by you. This requires you to have a good understanding of the chemistry of your process and therefore knowing which species to select.
<LI>This model is based on the assumption that the chemistry of the system attains chemical equilibrium.
</UL>
<P>
Thermodynamic modelling of complex systems requires a solution model which adequately describes the excess Gibbs free energies for the solution phases i.e. account for the non-ideality of the solution. A more detailed description of the Ideal Mixing of Complex Components approach may be found in <A HREF="ManCh5.htm">Chapter 5</A>.
<P>
If you wish to select one of the five available equilibrium models (six if you include the Multi Stage Equilibrium) you will have to specify the phase chemistry. This is discussed in a later section of this chapter.
<P>
<A NAME="Multi Stage Equilibrium Model">
<B><U>Multi Stage Equilibrium Model</U></B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>This model consists of a user-definable number of coupled equilibrium units connected in a cross-flow arrangement. The solids are passed from unit to unit while other feeds are split between units. The product gas streams are collectively grouped into a single stream.
</UL>
The following figure illustrates the multi-stage equilibrium model.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Man07.gif" WIDTH=450 HEIGHT=337 ALT="Figure7"></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Figure 7: The multi-stage equilibrium model</FONT>
<P>
The feeds which are to between the units must be labelled <I>-->Name</I> (<B>S</B>etup/<B>A</B>nalysis).
<P>
This unit was developed for the modelling of blowing operations where a fresh gas is brought into contact with a liquid which has already been exposed to fresh gas.

<P>
<A NAME="Operating Conditions">
<B><U>Operating Conditions</U></B><BR>
The following options are available through the <B>O</B>peration choice in the main menu. The screen display is shown below.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Man08.gif" WIDTH=565 HEIGHT=280 ALT="Figure8"></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Figure 8: Selecting the operating conditions of the system</FONT>
<P>
Select whether your process is to be temperature of energy controlled, the operating temperature and pressure, and the rate of energy loss from you unit (in kW).
<P>
A <B>temperature controlled unit</B> will calculate the energy requirements of the process based on your selected operating temperature. An <B>energy controlled unit</B> will balance the energy in the unit by varying the operating temperature, thus predicting a bulk operating temperature if the energy losses of the unit are known.
<P>
To select this option select 1 for energy control or 0 for temperature control.
<P>
If you have selected the temperature controlled option input the operating temperature in degrees Celsius.
<P>
Enter the <B>operating pressure</B> in atmospheres.
<P>
The value is entered as a rate of energy loss (kW).
<P>
This figure is usually a rough estimate depending on the configuration and geometry of the unit. Heat losses are sometimes assumed to be zero for comparison between various process routes, or for determining the theoretical specific energy requirement (kWh/kg) of a certain feed.

<P>
<A NAME="Observed Temperatures">
<B><U>Differences Between Operating and Observed Temperatures</U></B><BR>
For each unit there is allowance to make adjustments for stream temperatures that differ from the process temperature. An example of this is cooling of off-gas stream.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Man09.gif" WIDTH=565 HEIGHT=280 ALT="Figure9"></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Figure 9: Accounting for differences between the operating and observed temperatures of a stream</FONT>
<P>
Consider an off gas stream which cools when it passes through the burden of a submerged arc furnace. The temperature at which the gas leaves the furnace may be several hundred degrees cooler than the operating temperature of the unit. Thus the gas stream would be given a difference of -500&#186;C (for example); which would indicate that it is 500 degrees cooler than the temperature of the unit when it leaves the system. The energy balance would thus be corrected to account for this transfer of energy from the gas stream to the burden (feed).

<P>
<A NAME="Connecting Units">
<B><U>Connecting Units</U></B><BR>
The <B>I</B>nterconnect option from the main menu is only available if more than one process units are selected.
<P>
This option accounts for the possibility of a stream changing temperature between units, or for a stream being split before entering the next unit (e.g. 5 % of the gas product from a rotary kiln being carried over to the furnace).
<P>
To enter the values use the up/down cursor keys. The interconnection fractions are entered as a fraction of one. The temperatures reflected will be the temperatures of the input streams to the next unit.
<UL>
<LI>Additional feed streams to a following unit are entered from a second <B>F</B>eedrates menu that automatically appears (after <B>F10</B> has been pressed when selecting the feeds to the first unit). Feed streams are described below.
</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="Feed Streams">
<B><U>Feed Streams</U></B><BR>
Pyrosim requires a number of pre-defined inputs before being able to calculate any results; one of these prerequisites is at least one feed stream.
<P>
<A NAME="Defining a Feed Stream">
<B><U>Defining a Feed Stream</U></B><BR>
From the main menu select <B>S</B>etup/<B>A</B>nalyses. This brings you to the analyses screen. Use the up/down cursor keys to scroll to the option <New Material>. Press Enter. Type in a name for the feed material.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Man10.gif" WIDTH=565 HEIGHT=280 ALT="Figure10"></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Figure 10: Entering a new feed analysis.(for this example the name has been entered as Coal and 57% of the material is carbon) </FONT>
<P>
Now, using the up/down cursor keys, scroll through the list of alphabetically listed compounds entering the mass percent of each compound present in the feed material.
<P>
When all the compounds shown on the first screen have been selected press <B>F10</B> to see the next screen; continue making your selection.
<UL>
<LI>Feed stream analyses must total 100 % (within 0.5 %) otherwise the program will report the following message in the lower window:
<P>
Analysis total = X (X < 100 %), Press any key to resume editing.
<P>
This is a useful check to see if the analysis has been entered correctly (that's why Pyrosim doesn't normalise your input).
<P>
<LI>After a new feed analysis has been entered correctly Pyrosim will then return to the list of feed materials. Press <B>F10</B> to return to the Setup menu (<B>Esc</B> will exit without saving changes).
<LI>If you would like to enter another feed analysis repeat the above from the Setup menu.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="Modifying Feed Streams">
<B><U>Modifying Existing Feed Streams</U></B><BR>
To modify the analysis of an existing feed stream choose <B>S</B>etup/<B>A</B>nalyses, move the cursor (using the up/down cursor keys) to the material name to be changed and press Enter. You can now change the analyses as in the previous section but <B>remember to exit using F10 and not Esc</B>.

<P>
<A NAME="Equilibrium Specifications">
<B><U>Equilibrium Specifications</U></B><BR>
Pyrosim's most frequently used model is the equilibrium model. This model relies on chemical equilibrium being attained. Since pyrometallurgy is associated with very high temperatures (and low pressures), this assumption is often valid.
<P>
Nickel-copper matte smelting, reverbatory smelting of copper, the processing of platinum bearing concentrates (in a nickel copper system with a high MgO slag), the production of ferrochromium in a plasma arc furnace, cobalt recovery in slag cleaning operations, silico-manganese production, the secondary smelting of lead, the production of ferronickel from laterite ores, are examples of some processes which have been modelled using the equilibrium model.

Each equilibrium model is characterised by the choice of compounds allowed to be present at equilibrium. This choice may be edited by you at any time, this section describes how to set up your first equilibrium file and then edit it at a later stage.

<UL>
<LI>If the system doesn't converge there are a number of possible causes. Check to see if a mixed phase is disappearing (if one of the numbers beneath Convergence becomes greater than 1). This can be corrected by adding trace quantities (<0.1kg/h) of an inert substance to that phase, like argon to a gas stream or platinum to a metallic stream. This would involve specifying such a compound (<B>S</B>etup/<B>E</B>quilib) in the phase, and defining feeds containing these dummy compounds.

<P>
The output can be saved to a text file in the ASCII format by selecting this option (<B>S</B>etup/<B>P</B>rinter) and then using the DOS utility PRN2FILE.EXE (also supplied with Pyrosim).
<P>
A copy of the report output supplies all the information necessary to reconstruct a model.

<P>
<A NAME="Analysing the Results">
<B><U>Analysing the Results</U></B><BR>
The <B>analyses</B> output reports the status of the compounds present in the system in both the feed and product streams. This output is useful for determining which species are responsible for certain partitions, e.g. the carbides accounting for carbon in the metal.
<P>
If any compounds have been selected in the equilibrium file and don't form in the product stream remove them from the equilibrium specification by editing the equilibrium file. This will have no bearing on your results and make Pyrosim run faster for the defined system.
<P>
In the <B>elemental analyses</B> summary slag analyses are reported as their common oxides. For example <B><I>Al</I></B> in a slag is usually reported as <B><I>Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB></I></B>. Pyrosim calculates percent Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB> in slag = X * (MW<SUB>Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB></SUB> / (2*MW<SUB>Al</SUB>)) where MW<SUB>Al</SUB> and MW<SUB>Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB></SUB> are the molecular weight of aluminium and alumina respectively.
<P>
The default settings for <B>flow rate</B> and <B>energy requirements</B> in Pyrosim are <B>kg/h</B> and <B>kW</B>. If you choose to work with other units for flow rate remember to convert your energy values accordingly.

<P>
<A NAME="Document">
<B><U>Document</U></B><BR>
It is possible to obtain hard copies of the system's thermodynamic data, equilibrium specification and the feed material analyses. This is done through the <B>D</B>ocument option from the main menu.

<A NAME="Editing and Adding Thermodynamic Data">
<B><U>Editing and Adding Thermodynamic Data</U></B><BR>
One of the most common errors made is to forget to select certain key species when selecting the thermodynamic data for a system. This section describes how data can be added to the THERMDAT.EXT data-base created with Thermo or Pyromake.
<UL>
<LI><B>Using Thermo</B>: Simply run Thermo, choose e<B>X</B>port from the main menu, select the species, select the three character identifier for the system, press <B>F10</B> and enter. Thermo will verify that the data has been sucessfully exported.
</UL>
<P>
This option has been disabled in Pyrosim version 1.50 (all registered users of Pyrosim version 1.50 are also registered users of Thermo). If you have an old version of Pyrosim then please read on.
<P>
Choose <B>S</B>etup/<B>T</B>hermo Data to add or alter data of a specific data-base. The following warning appears.
<P>

<P>
Press <I>Y</I> to continue. Select the compound to edit using the cursor keys to move the cursor and <B>Enter</B> to select the compound. If you wish to add a new compound to the list move to the <New> pointer and press <B>Enter</B>. From there just follow the prompts.

<P>
Simply move to the value to be changed and insert the new value.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=red><B>&#215;</B> If equilibrium specifications already exist and the list of species in the data-base is extended, all equilibrium specification files are erased once <B>F10</B> is pressed. It is therefore recommended that a printout of all equilibrium specifications be made before new data is added (<B>D</B>ocument/<B>E</B>quilibrium).</FONT>
<P>
Pyrosim only allows three new species to be added to the data-base at a time, to add more restart Pyrosim and repeat the procedure.
<P>
<A NAME="Recovering the Erased Equilibrium File">
<B><U>Recovering the Erased Equilibrium File</U></B><BR>
There are two ways of regenerating the deleted equilibrium specification files. The option first is to merely re specify all the species present at equilibrium (<B>S</B>etup/<B>E</B>quilibrium), using the printout as reference.
<P>
The second is to use an undelete utility like the DOS command undelete (DOS ver. 3.* and higher, just type <I>UNDELETE EQUIL*.*</I>). This will recover the equilibrium specification as it was before the new species were added. The new species can then be added to the correct phase by editing the equilibrium file in the normal manner (<B>S</B>etup/<B>E</B>quilibrium).
<P>
The current version of Pyrosim does not allow the user to add any additional thermodynamic data to the main data-base (THERMO.DAT). For more information on extended data bases contact Mintek's Pyrometallurgy Division.

<P>
<A NAME="Using Recycle Streams">
<B><U>Using Recycle Streams</U></B><BR>
In certain operations some product streams are recycled as feed streams to a previous unit operation, e.g., in matte smelting and converting the converter slag is often recycled to the furnace.
<P>
All recycle streams are marked (<B>S</B>etup/<B>A</B>nalyses) as <I>*->PhaseNumber</I>, where <I>Phase</I> is the phase under consideration and <I>Number</I> is the unit where this stream is a product e.g., *->Slag3 indicates that the slag from unit 3 is a recycle stream.
<P>
The stream is given any arbitrary initial analyses (Pyrosim will automatically replace this arbitrary analysis with the correct assay after the calculation has been performed).
<P>
For the first iteration, the feedrate of this stream is set to 0. After the calculation, press the <B>F2</B> key which will automatically save the analyses of all streams marked with <I>*->PhaseNumber</I>.
<P>
The flowrate of the product e.g., the slag stream from Unit 3 can be checked on screen (<B>S</B>ummary) and this value can now be entered as a feedrate. The process is repeated, until the input is equal to the output or a certain percentage of recycle is reached (thus allowing for a purge stream), with <B>F2</B> being pressed after each iteration.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Man23.gif" WIDTH=565 HEIGHT=280 ALT="Figure23"></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Figure 23: A screen printout showing an example with a recycle stream</FONT>
<P>
The figure above shows a hypothetical two stage process where the slag product from stage 2 is recycled to the first stage. The recycle stream is thus not shown on the flow diagram but the streams are reported in the report.
<P>
Pyrosim automatically converges the recycle loop using successive substitution. Currently 100% of any stream designated as a recycle stream is recycled (request for a bleed/purge steam should be directed to Rodney Jones).

<P>
<A NAME="Entrainment">
<B><U>Entrainment</U></B><BR>
In processes involving the formation of more than one liquid phase, clean separation of the different phases seldom occurs since there tends to be entrainment of the different phases in one another.
<P>
To simulate this physical phenomenon you must edit the last lines of the file NEWCALC.EXT. There you will find the following lists:
<P>
Entrainment factors for each unit:
<PRE>1 Solids in Slag; 2 Slag in Solids; 3 Solids in Metal; 4 Metal in Solids</PRE>
<PRE>5 Solids in Matte; 6 Matte in Solids; 7 Slag in Metal; 8 Metal in Slag</PRE>
<PRE>9 Slag in Matte; 10 Matte in Slag; 11 Metal in Matte; 12 Matte in Metal</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0</PRE>
<PRE>0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0</PRE>
<PRE>0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,<B>0.13</B>,0,0</PRE>
<PRE>0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0</PRE>
<P>
The descriptions above (1-12) relate to each number in the list. The four lists of numbers relate to each unit (out of a possible four present) in a flowsheet. If you had a single unit model, you would only need to consider the first list of numbers.
<P>
Therefore the 0.13 in the list above represents 13% of the Matte entrained in the Slag in unit 3.
<P>
This describes the entrainment option for Pyrosim version 1.50.

<P>
<A NAME="Bypass Streams">
<B><U>Bypass Streams</U></B><BR>
In many operations a certain fraction of the feed bypasses the reaction unit. Pyrosim allows up to 9 different fractions of bypass. All the different bypass streams are combined as a Dust phase in the <B>F</B>lowrates output.
<P>
To activate this facility, all feed materials that bypass a unit to a certain degree are indicated as <I>##NumberName</I> (<B>S</B>etup/<B>A</B>nalyses), where <I>Number</I> is any integer from 1 to 9 and <I>N</I>ame is the name of the stream, e.g. <I>##3Air</I>. For materials having the same fraction of bypass (they) must have the same integer value. 
<P>
Bypass factors are also found in the NEWCALC.EXT file, just above the entrainment factors.
<P>
<PRE>0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0</PRE>

For example if 15 per cent of ##3CO bypasses a unit, the third number in must be set to 0.15.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Man24.gif" WIDTH=470 HEIGHT=175 ALT="Figure24"></CENTER>

This describes the bypass operation for Pyrosim version 1.50.

<P>
<A NAME="Using Total Feedrate">
<B><U>Using Total Feedrate</U></B><BR>
For processes having many different feed materials, it can be a tedious task adding up the feedrates to complete a total material balance.
<P>
To overcome this problem, an external facility was added to the program, which can be activated by the DOS command <I>PYROSIM \TOTAL</I>. For all units in the operation that have external feed sources (not linked feed streams), the total feed rate will then be displayed.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Man25.gif" WIDTH=470 HEIGHT=175 ALT="Figure25"></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Figure 25: The total function sums the flowrates of feeds to a process</FONT>

<P>
<A NAME="Multi-Stage Equilibrium">
<B><U>Multi-Stage Equilibrium</U></B><BR>
The multi-stage equilibrium model (<B>M</B>odel) was allows for up to 99 units to be linked in a co-current arrangement.
<P>
Pyrosim does not support counter-current flow since the solution procedure would be an iterative one, co-current arrangement is solved sequentially which is computationally far faster. The model can be operated under temperature or energy control (<B>O</B>peration).
<P>
The phases present in the multi-stage equilibrium model (<B>S</B>etup/<B>E</B>quilibrium/<B>M</B>ulti-stage) are specified exactly as for any other equilibrium model.
<P>
All feed materials that are to be split between stages must be marked as <I>-->Name</I>, e.g.,<I>-->Air</I> (<B>S</B>etup/<B>A</B>nalyses). When <B>C</B>alculate is pressed, the user will be prompted to give the number of equilibrium stages in series.
<P>
All gaseous products are combined as one final Gas products stream.
<P>
This unit is also discussed briefly in the <A HREF="ManCh2.htm">previous chapter</A> under the heading Choosing a model.

<A NAME="Multi Unit Simulation">
<B><U>Multi Unit Simulation</U></B><BR>
Multi-unit processes are calculated in sequential order. Therefore, if the process contains four stages the first three stages will have to be recalculated before any changes made to the last unit can be analysed. To save time the following feature has been incorporated.
<P>
What is involved is that the conditions of the streams entering the last unit are updated and retained. These are then fed to a final unit (the previous units being discarded). Thus the process flow sheet is reduced to a single unit, allowing quick optimisation of this final unit.
<P>
The procedure to be followed is listed below. Note that every step must be meticulously followed, otherwise errors will occur.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Make printout of the system before any changes are made. This is useful for reconstructing the entire process after the last stage has been optimised.
<LI>Set up new feed streams (<B>S</B>etup/<B>A</B>nalysis) to account for the phases that are being passed to the final unit. Each phase must be accounted for separately and must be named as <I>*->PhaseNumber</I> where <I>Phase</I> is the phase being passed to the final unit and <I>Number</I> is the number of the unit from which the stream originates.
<P>
For example, if the slag and metal from the second last unit are being passed to the last unit the names would be: <I>*->Slag1</I> and <I>*->Metal1</I>. Give these streams an arbitrary analysis e.g. Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB> = 100 % (Pyrosim will automatically update this analysis with the correct analysis once <B>F2</B> has been pressed).
<P>
<LI>Make sure the feed and operating conditions are correctly specified for the first units.
<LI><B>C</B>alculate.
<LI>After the Report menu appears press <B>F2</B> to save the product analysis.
<P>
This action instructs Pyrosim to replace the arbitrary analysis for the specified streams with the actual analyses (this is why the names are so specific, as Pyrosim must be told to replace the stream to the last unit with the stream composition from the second last unit).
<P>
<LI>From the report menu obtain a printout (<B>F</B>lowrates) or use <B>S</B>ummary to note the <I>flowrates</I> and <I>temperatures</I> of the streams that enter the last unit.
<LI>Escape to the main menu.
<LI>Edit the process flow sheet to a single unit using the f<B>L</B>owsheet command, make sure that the equilibrium file for the last unit is the correct one.
<LI>Enter the feedrates and temperatures of the new streams, i.e. those named <I>*->PhaseNumber</I>. The feedrates and temperatures are obtained from the report menu i.e. the <I>flowrates</I> and <I>temperatures</I> mentioned above.
<LI>Move the cursor to <B>I</B>nterconnect and press enter. This action resets the Pyrosim output format from a multi-unit process to that of a single unit.
<LI><B>C</B>alculate. The flowsheet should now have only the last unit but should be accepting the products from the second last unit and thus accounting for all the preceding units in the process.
<P>
Once the last unit has been optimised reinstate all the units, calculate the final products and print out a report for a hard copy of the system.
<P>
</UL>
This feature is worth mastering for models containing more than three or four units.

<A NAME="Editing the Pyrosim.cfg File">
<B><U>Editing the Pyrosim.cfg File</U></B><BR>
The configuration file of Pyrosim has the following format:
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Man27.gif" WIDTH=450 HEIGHT=337 ALT="Figure27"></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Figure 27: Editing the PYROSIM.CFG file</FONT>
<P>
Pyrosim supports outputs to 5 different printers.
<P>
The correct printer can be selected under <B>S</B>etup/<B>P</B>rinter ,and by pressing <B>F10</B>, the printer configuration will be saved in the PYROSIM.CFG file. If the correct printer has not been selected and the user has completed a simulation, the Printer option in the document menu allows the printer configuration to be changed temporarily. This printer set-up is not saved and the printer setting return to its previous setting if Pyrosim is exited.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=red><B>&#215;</B> The configuration file is a source of error generation (normally Error 7 or 9). Make sure that the limits in points 1) and 2) are not exceeded.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=blue><B>&#164;</B> With the VIDRAM utility you can free up more memory (approximately 70 kb) to support larger models. This allows you to re-specify the maximum number of materials, species and elements present in your system.</FONT>
<P>
<B>Maxmaterials</B> is the number of feed materials allowed to be present.
<P>
<B>Specieslimit</B> is the number of species allowed per phase, e.g. for the above configuration file a maximum of 70 species can be present in any of the phases.

<P>
<A NAME="Renaming of Phases">
<B><U>Renaming of Phases</U></B><BR>
By editing the file NEWCALC.EXT (DOS command: <I>edit NEWCALC.EXT</I>, where <I>EXT</I> is the suffix used in Thermo or Pyromake), the first nine lines of the file will look similar to the following:
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Man28.gif" WIDTH=450 HEIGHT=234 ALT="Figure28"></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Figure 28: The beginning of the file NEWCALC.EXT</FONT>
<P>
If for example, you want to redefine the metal phase as a 'carbide' phase, merely replace "Metal" with "Carbide" and save the file. The NEWCALC.EXT file is only generated once Pyrosim has done a simulation. Take care not to tamper with the rest of the file.
<P>
Do not change the name of the Slag phase. This phase should always represent an oxide phase as the elemental analyses express some compounds in this phase in the form of basic oxides.

<P>
<A NAME="Interpreting the Active Screen">
<B><U>Interpreting the Active Screen</U></B><BR>
Once <B>C</B>alculate has been pressed and the program is busy with an iteration, the active screen can provide information regarding the simulation. By looking at the kmoles/h of the different species, those having a value of zero can be removed from the equilibrium specification (<B>S</B>etup/<B>E</B>quilib). This will speed up iterations, especially if many species have been selected.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=red><B>&#215;</B> It is however dangerous to tamper with the equilibrium specifications since species may form under different operating conditions.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=blue><B>&#164;</B> The convergence factor (less than 0.00001) will show which phases do not form, since the value of the convergence factor of the corresponding phase(s) will become very large, while <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#119;</FONT> will tend to zero.</FONT>
<P>
If a pure solids phase has been selected in the equilibrium file and it does not form, <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#119;</FONT> will reach zero and iterations will continue but not converge. No error message will be displayed and this phase(s) must be removed from the equilibrium specification (<B>S</B>etup/<B>E</B>quilib) in order for the simulation to converge.
<P>
A simulation can be terminated at any time by pressing the <B>Esc</B> key. The results of such a simulation must not be trusted.
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="Mineralogy">
<B><U>Mineralogy</U></B><BR>
If the mineralogy of the sample is not available, the chemical analyses of the feed material can be converted to a mineralogical analyses.
<P>
Although this will not affect the predicted equilibrium compositions (because the equilibrium distribution is dependent on the moles of each element present , which remain the same), the energy requirements for the process will increase. The mineralogical analyses results in a more stable feed material, i.e., more energy is required to break the chemical bonds.

<P>
<A NAME="Activity Coefficients">
<B><U>Activity Coefficients</U></B><BR>
Activity coefficients can now be added to account for non ideal behaviour of components in phases.
<P>
Using DOS Edit, or a similar text editor, create four files, called ACT001.EXT,....ACT004.EXT (where EXT is your three character identifier).
<P>
The files should contain the following lines:<BR>
<PRE>rem: Phase number, species number, a + bT (K)</PRE>
<PRE>1</PRE>
<PRE>1,1,1,0</PRE>
<P>
Each file (ACT001.EXT...ACT004.EXT) contains the activity coefficient data for a unit (1-4). The first line beginning with rem, is a remark which explains the format of the data which follows. The second line contains a number representing the number of activity coefficient expressions which follow. The last line shown implies that the activity coefficient of the first species in the first phase is equal to 1, and that there is no dependence on temperature.
<P>
If you wished to include activity coefficient data for carbon and iron in a metal phase in unit 2 the ACT002.EXT would need to be edited to look something like:
<P>
<PRE>rem: Phase number, species number, a + bT (K) </PRE>
<PRE>2</PRE>
<PRE>3,1,0.9,0</PRE>
<PRE>3,2,0.99,0.001</PRE>
<P>
This is assuming that the first two species (e.g. C and Fe) in the metal phase (third phase) have activity coefficients. The activity coefficient for carbon is (arbitrarily) fixed at 0.9 (and is independent of temperature); the activity coefficient for iron is given by 0.99+0.001*T(K).
<P>
Note that this facility contains a limitation regarding the order of components present in each phase. If, for example, boron (B) was also present in the equilibrium selection, and was present at equilibrium, then carbon and iron would be the second and third components present in the metal phase. The ACT002.EXT file would then need to be manually updated. If however, boron was selected in the equilibrium specification, but was not present at equilibrium, then carbon and iron would remain the first and second compounds in the metal phase and ACT002.EXT would not need to be updated. It is hoped that this feature will soon be incorporated into the menu structure of Pyrosim.

<BR>

Some additional considerations have evolved that have enabled more reliance to be placed in the predicted values obtained from Pyrosim.

<P>
<A NAME="Energy Balance">
<B><U>Pyrosim's Energy Balance</U></B><BR>
The energy requirements for a process are automatically calculated by calculating the difference between the enthalpy of formation of the products and reactants in the system.
<P>
Incorrect phase data may be used for the final process enthalpy balance if care is not taken to specify the correct phase data and force Pyrosim to use this data. This is best explained by using an example.
<P>
For example: Consider the problem of heating a typical slag from 25&nbsp;&#186;C to 1700&nbsp;&#186;C.
<P>
The slag's composition is SiO<SUB>2</SUB>=25&nbsp;%, Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>=25&nbsp;%, CaO=25&nbsp;%, MgO=25 %&nbsp;(all mass %). According to Osborne et al. the slag liquidus temperature will be about 1650&nbsp;&#186;C. However at 1650&nbsp;&#186;C all the pure compounds are solids.
<P>
Pyrosim's routine searches for the compound of interest and then selects the data applicable to the specified temperature. Thus, Pyrosim would use <I>solid</I> phase data, for each pure compound, to calculate the energy requirements needed to heat a <I>liquid</I> system from 1650&nbsp;&#186;C to 1700&nbsp;&#186;C.
<P>
An error is therefore occurring because the enthalpy of transition from solid to liquid is erroneously being omitted.
<P>
The scarcity of data for complex systems means that all Pyrosim energy balances conducted in this way will always contain some error.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=blue><B>&#164;</B> You can eliminate part of this problem by doing the following:<BR>
Specify a separate species (by editing the thermodynamic data file, if necessary) with the correct phase data (i.e. the liquid phase data). This will be extrapolated to the lower temperature of interest. For example, create a compound CaO(l) that consists of only the data for the liquid phase of CaO but is valid across the entire temperature range from 298&nbsp;&#186;C to 3500&nbsp;&#186;C.</FONT>
<P>
As enthalpy is a state function, the enthalpy function for each phase will account for the total enthalpy of each compound up to the specified temperature. By specifying the new compounds CaO(l), SiO<SUB>2</SUB>(l), Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>(l) and MgO(l) as the only species allowed to be present at equilibrium in the slag phase, the energy balance will be as correct as possible (given the form of the thermodynamic data).
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Man30.gif" WIDTH=450 HEIGHT=166 ALT="Figure30"></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Figure 30: A correctly specified system for heating a slag with individual pure component data given for a different phase at the specified temperature</FONT>
<P>
In reality this discrepancy in the energy balance may not be of any significance and would need to be checked. When producing ferrochromium, the total energy required to heat the feed added to that required for the chemical reactions taking place is far greater than that energy associated with heating a relatively small amount of slag using incorrect phase data.
<P>
However, if the process in question contained a large recycle stream consisting of hot slag (the enthalpy of which was incorrectly calculated) the potential error could be very significant.

<P>
<A NAME="Mass Balance">
<B><U>Factors That Affect the Mass Balance</U></B><BR>
An attempt has been made to describe the influence that some factors are known to have on the prediction of the mass balance using the equilibrium model.
<P>
<A NAME="Temperature Controlled">
<B><U>The Temperature Controlled Model</U></B><BR>
For a temperature controlled model the predicted mass balance is affected by four factors:
<UL>
<LI>The feed composition entering the process (i.e. the quantity of each element present in the system)
<LI>The equilibrium specification. (i.e. the specified interactions between elements) It is possible, by changing the equilibrium specification of a system, to force certain elements into certain phases
<LI>The temperature.
<LI>The pressure.
</UL>
<P>
The mass balance is <I>not</I> affected by the temperature of the feed streams, or the mineralogical phase description of a feed material.
<P>
<A NAME="Energy Controlled">
<B><U>The Energy Controlled Model</U></B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>For an energy controlled model the material and energy balances are coupled. The temperature of the feed streams determines the unit operating temperature that will be attained. This in turn affects the equilibrium composition of the system.
<LI>As in the temperature controlled model the equilibrium specification, of species allowed to be present at equilibrium, will determine the final product composition (as will the feed ratios of elements entering the system, and the selected operating pressure).
</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="IMCC">
<B><U>Ideal Mixing of Complex Components Model</U></B><BR>
Pyrometallurgical slags, in particular, are usually non-dilute systems which render the procedure of extending activities for binary dilute systems to higher order systems inaccurate. In order to ensure that Pyrosim could deal with a large variety of non-dilute systems, both simple and complex, the Ideal Mixing of Complex Compounds approach has been adopted in preference to other models based on extensive experimental investigation.
<P>
Jones and Botes state that: "Many oxide systems are characterised by strong acid-base chemical interactions, leading to negative deviations in thermodynamic activities that are much larger than those predicted by the ideal solution or regular solution models" Silicate systems are cited as an example wherein the activity of silica varies greatly within a narrow compositional range.
<P>
The Ideal Mixing of Complex Components (IMCC) model is based on the identification of complex components, e.g. 2MgO.SiO<SUB>2</SUB> (in a slag phase) and Fe<SUB>3</SUB>Si (in a metallic solution). Thermodynamic data for these components is recorded in the Pyrosim database and the specification of a complex component like 2MgO.SiO<SUB>2</SUB> in the equilibrium specification of a slag phase will contribute in part to accounting for the activities of MgO and SiO<SUB>2</SUB> of the system (by accounting for some chemical interaction between MgO and SiO<SUB>2</SUB>). The specification of other complex compounds will also contribute in part to the individual activities and thus, by specifying a seemingly complicated system a realistic model is obtained.
<P>
The species present in the equilibrium specification do not relate directly to the mixture speciation. They should be regarded as intermediate compounds, present to theoretically account for non-ideal chemical interaction between reference compounds, en route to a final product composition.
<P>
This model thus allows non-ideality to be accounted for without relying on an analytical model of the activity function, which could contain large experimental uncertainty, and in most cases is limited to simple, well documented, systems.
<P>
An important assumption made is that chemical interactions dominate in the formation of species and physical interactions are assumed to be negligible.
<P>
Thus applying the model to situations where no available activity information is present is a trivial procedure. Simply select all species that contain combinations of the reference compounds present.
<P>
If a specie or phase has incomplete data, Pyrosim will extrapolate the available data using the functional form of <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#68;</FONT>G<SUB>f</SUB>&#186;. The associated errors are expected to be small when compared to the typical error associated with <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#68;</FONT>G<SUB>f</SUB>&#186;.
<P>
A limitation of such a model is its reliance on the accuracy of tabulated thermodynamic data.

<H1 ALIGN=center>THE EMPIRICAL MODEL</H1>

<HR>
<BR>


This model (which is also Pyrosim's newest feature) is a mass balance model which may be specified in much the same way as the equilibrium models are specified (from the main menu choose <B>S</B>etup/<B>E</B>mpirical). Select as a unit model EmpiricalGen1 (to 5). Choose which compounds are present in each phase (in the same manner as you would set up an equilibrium model).
<P>
Once Calculate has been pressed you will be prompted for various ratios. These ratios are user definable. Common ratios that could be specified in furnaces are typically the CO:CO<SUB>2</SUB>, SO:SO<SUB>2</SUB> and H<SUB>2</SUB>:H<SUB>2</SUB>O. These are not restricted to a phase and you could have the ratio of a species in one phase to a completely unrelated species in another phase if you so wished.
<P>
Pyrosim keeps count of the number of ratios which have been specified and subtracts these from the number of required composition specifications.
<P>
All these required specifications arise from the number of species present in each phase; each specie is a variable in the system of linear equations which needs to be constructed to solve the system. As this model is merely a mass balance routine what you are doing is giving Pyrosim just enough information so that it will be able to fill in all the remaining gaps.
<P>
The quantities and analyses of the feed streams are known, and once the number of specifications equals the number of remaining unknowns the system of equations can be solved (by pressing <B>Enter</B>).
<P>
The equations are formulated as follows:
<UL>
<LI>The number of unknowns equals the number of species in each phase i.e., <I>n</I> (this because the analyses are pre-defined and the feedrates specified).
<LI>The element balances provide <I>y</I> equations.
<LI>Each mass or mole ratio is an equation <I>r</I>.
<LI>Every composition is also an equation <I>c</I>.
<LI>Once the number of equations equals the number of unknowns (<I>n</I>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<I>y</I>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<I>r</I>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<I>c</I>) the system is soluble.
</UL>
<P>
However the specification also must be mathematically independent. If you have a metal phase containing four elements, you can only make three composition specifications in this phase because the fourth specification can be inferred (as the sum of the compositions must total 100 %). Also note that composition specifications of zero percent are not acceptable as an input, (any composition of zero percent will be read by Pyrosim as an unknown and it will try and calculate a value for this variable)
<P>
If the system is not soluble the program will report the following message: <I>Error, try a different specification</I>. This means that you must change your specification and try again.
<P>
Some <B>rules of thumb</B> are being developed:
<P>
Any element reporting to more than one phase will require (<I>n-1</I>) specifications, where <I>n</I> is the number of components. This is true for all components except one, which will require (<I>n-2</I>) specifications.
<P>
If the program calculates <B>negative flowrates</B> it implies that the quantity of an element (available in the feed streams) is insufficient to satisfy the requirements according to the specifications you have made. This means that some changes may be necessary, either to the feed quantities, or to the specifications made. For example, when analysing the mass balance of a matte smelter we consistently got negative flowrates for sulphur in the system. We eventually found that the feed assays were erroneous and that the sulphur in the feed was greater than that which was originally reported.
<P>
Empirical balance models are not trivial to configure, but, once defined, these models can rapidly evaluate mass and energy balances.
<P>
This model has been applied to verfiying mass flows (when few measurements are made).

The stainless steel models have traditionally been supplied with Pyrosim to provide some working examples to the new user. These models are now being phased out.
<P>
If you intend using similar process models you should try to configure your own using either an empirical model or an equilibrium model.
<P>
If, however, you chose to run the stainless steel models you would have to run PYRO143.EXE (which is Pyrosim version 1.43) and select the stainless steel (SS) system in the data file selection menu.
<P>
From the Main menu select <B>M</B>odels.

PYROBAL accounts for the additional energy terms (over or under estimation) resulting from: limestone decomposition; CO<SUB>2</SUB> conversion due to the Boudouard reaction; volatiles present in the coke reductant; and the water gas shift reaction.

Mintek's Measurement &amp; Control Division (MaC) develops and provides innovative 
technology and services in the field of metallurgical  process control, to benefit the minerals
industry in South Africa and world-wide.
<P>
MaC is driven by industry's need to
<UL>
<LI>understand the complexities of modern mineral-processing operations
<LI>develop measurement techniques for difficult-to-measure variables, and
<LI>develop and implement control strategies in industry, to improve process efficiency and
product quality.
</UL>
The main thrust of the work  embraces process analysis, the development of specialist
instrumentation, and controller design and implementation. Other aspects include digital
systems, control theory, dynamic modelling and simulation, artificial intelligence (neural
networks and expert systems), signal processing and conditioning, and operator interface
design.
<P>
These fundamental investigations play an important role in the development of specific
techniques that are applied to real industrial problems.

improved by the introduction of the <A HREF="http://www.mintek.ac.za/EMD/CIP/CIP.htm">carbon-in-pulp</A> 
(CIP) and carbon-in-leach (CIL) recovery processes.<P>For these operations 
to be performed efficiently, it is critical to control the concentration 
of carbon in the pulp. Traditional methods of measurement, which involve 
sampling the pulp by hand and analysing the carbon content by weighing, are 
time-consuming and often inaccurate, leading to poor control of the process 
and consequent losses of gold.

The recently developed Debex C<SUP>2</SUP> Meter for the first time provides 
plant metallurgists with a self-contained instrument to monitor continuously 
the concentration and distribution of carbon in the CIP and CIL adsorption 
tanks - thereby optimizing the recovery of gold.
<P>
By linking the signal from the C<SUP>2</SUP> Meter to the interstage pumps 
between the adsorption tanks, the transfer of carbon can be automated, and 
the entire adsorption operation stabilized by controlling the carbon profile 
to set-point levels.

<H2>Operating principle</H2>

The Debex C<SUP>2</SUP> Meter is based on the principle that the attenuation 
of a high-frequency ultrasonic signal transmitted through the pulp can be 
used to calculate the concentration of carbon in the pulp.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=left HSPACE=10 SRC="c2graph1.gif" WIDTH=311 HEIGHT=262 ALT="Graph1">
The degree of attenuation caused by particles suspended in the pulp, whether 
they are ore or carbon, depends on the particle size, particle concentration, 
and the frequency of the ultrasonic signal. If the pulp contains particles 
of different sizes, the relationship is a complex one. However, in the use 
of the C<SUP>2</SUP> Meter, the effect caused by the variation in ore size 
and carbon particle size on a 1 MHz signal is negligible. Since the pulp 
density is compensated for, the only variable left to affect the 
attenuation is the concentration of carbon particles.<BR CLEAR=left>

<H2>The instrument</H2>

<IMG ALIGN=left HSPACE=10 SRC=C2meter.gif WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=125 ALT="The meter">
The instrument consists of an immersion probe and a control panel. The probe, 
which contains a matched transmitter/receiver pair of piezoelectric (PZT) 
ceramic transducers to generate and measure the attenuation of the ultrasonic 
signal, is immersed directly into the adsorption tank. The control panel, 
which contains the microprocessor-controlled electronics, includes a liquid 
crystal display (LCD) and a keyboard which are used to initialize and 
calibrate the instrument. Remote display facilities are provided for by 
industry-standard links.

<BODY>

<H1 ALIGN=center>A multivariable stabilizer for flotation control</H1>

Flotation processes are difficult to control and stabilize. This is due to the interaction between
different parts of the process.
<P>
Often an attempt is made to optimize the process before it has been stabilized. The optimizer will
sometimes seem to work, while at other times it does not. It is therefore important to look at
stabilization first.
<P>
The one variable that can be controlled on most plants is the pulp level. As long as the
measurement and valve are reliable, level control is possible.
<P>
<H2>The basis of level control</H2>

Level control on flotation plants is not trivial. Normal PI control with a separate controller on
each bank of cells is not the most suitable technique, as each valve acts on its own, and passes
disturbances to the next flotation bank. The result is that disturbances are not neutralized, but
spread right through the flotation plant.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=left HSPACE=10 ALT="Fig.1" SRC="impc1.gif" WIDTH=290 HEIGHT=207>
Figure 1 shows the level trends for three flotation banks in series. Notice how the disturbance
propagates from the primary rougher through the secondary rougher to the final rougher.
<P>
A multivariable controller, the 'FloatStar' has therefore been developed that will 'warn' valves
lower down in the circuit of disturbances headed towards them.
<BR CLEAR=left>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=left HSPACE=10 ALT="Fig2" SRC="impc2.gif" WIDTH=290 HEIGHT=207>
Figure 2 shows the level control achieved by
FloatStar. Disturbances are effectively neutralized in all three banks. Compare this with the trends
shown in Figure 1.
<P>
Were the controllers in Figure 1 not just badly tuned? Does this new control strategy ensure better
level control than a set of perfectly tuned PI controllers?<BR CLEAR=left>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=left HSPACE=10 ALT="Fig.3" SRC="impc3.gif" WIDTH=290 HEIGHT=207>
Figure 3 shows the maximum singular value plot for the sensitivity
transfer functions for both systems. It shows that a set of PI controllers is more likely to amplify
disturbances with a period of between 5 and 100 seconds - exactly the kind that occur naturally
on flotation plants.<BR CLEAR=left>
<P>
FloatStar's multivariable algorithm is therefore more effective than even a set of perfectly tuned
PI controllers.
<P>
<H2>Results</H2>

<IMG ALIGN=left HSPACE=10 ALT="Fig.4" SRC="impc4.gif" WIDTH=289 HEIGHT=213>
Figure 4 shows the results of a series of step tests done at an industrial
plant. First, the setpoint of the primary rougher was adjusted, and the level more-or-less followed
the step change. Then the setpoint of the secondary rougher was changed, followed by that of the
final rougher. <BR CLEAR=left>
<P>
All setpoints were then returned simultaneously to their initial positions, giving the plant a knock
from which it recovered only slowly.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=left HSPACE=10 ALT="Fig.5" SRC="impc5.gif" WIDTH=290 HEIGHT=212>
Figure 5 shows the behavior of the plant following the same setpoint
changes, but using the multivariable controller. Note how quickly the levels reach their new
setpoints and stay there, even when they are changed simultaneously.<BR CLEAR=left>
<P>
<H2>Expected benefits of level control</H2>

Will improved level control have a beneficial effect on the economic efficiency of the plant?
<P>
Figure 6 shows how the level of the primary rougher deviated from its
setpoint (0). The data show the number of times that the level in Figure 1 was at a certain distance
from its setpoint.
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<IMG ALT="Fig.6" SRC="impc6.gif" WIDTH=367 HEIGHT=227>
<P>
By controlling level, we are essentially trying to control grade, because these two variables  have
a linear relationship. Any deviation from a level setpoint will therefore also result in a deviation
from the grade setpoint.
<P>

However, because grade and recovery are not linearly dependent,
decreases in grade (i.e. when the level is too high) will not be made up by gains in recovery, and
<I>vice versa</I>. Figure 7 shows an approximate grade-recovery curve, with the grade (level)
deviation curve reflected onto the recovery curve. Note how the lower half of the grade
distribution is compressed on the recovery distribution, while the top end is spread out.
<P ALIGN=center>
<IMG ALT="Fig.7" SRC="impc7.gif" WIDTH=358 HEIGHT=266>
<P>
<H2>Measured benefits</H2>

A series of tests was conducted on a plant to compare the efficiency of normal PI control with
that of multivariable control. The plant was alternately controlled by the PI controllers and
FloatStar for 2-day periods.
<P ALIGN=center>
<IMG ALT="Fig.8" SRC="impc8.gif" WIDTH=342 HEIGHT=231>
<P>
The 'normalized' average recoveries for each period are shown in Figure
8. The recoveries achieved with FloatStar are consistently higher than those using the PI
controller. Notice also that both curves follow a long-term trend, with the recoveries dropping
off over the first 10 periods of measurement, and then starting to climb towards the end of the test
series.
<P>
The multivariable level control algorithm of the FloatStar controller ensures not only better level
control than a set of individual level controllers using PI control, but also better process efficiency.

<BODY>

<H1 ALIGN=center>Milling control and optimization</H1>

Effective mineral extraction depends on the first processing stage - comminution. Overgrinding
wastes energy, and leads to losses of valuable minerals during flotation. Undergrinding reduces
recovery due to poor liberation.
<P>
Optimum milling and classification is aimed at

<UL>
<LI>increasing throughput
<LI>lowering energy consumption
<LI>reducing variations in product quality
<LI>controlling the product size for maximum efficiency of the downstream extraction processes.
</UL>

Mintek's MillStar controller and associated optimization strategy were developed to stabilize and
improve the operation of  milling circuits. The technology is based on an in-depth understanding
of the milling process and process-control techniques, and many years of practical experience in
operating and controlling milling circuits. The benefits have been proved in industry for more than
10 years, on some of the world's largest gold mines.

<H3>Multivariable control</H3>

Milling circuits are highly interactive from a control point of view, in that each parameter in the
circuit influences all the other parameters. A change in any one of the inputs to the plant will cause
the product size to fluctuate. Also, there may be sizeable delays and complex dynamic responses
between the control actions and the measurements. Single-loop control systems are therefore not
particularly effective, and some form of multivariable control is needed to compensate for
interactions in the system, and to stabilize the operation at a high level of efficiency.
<P>
In multivariable control, the aim is to create a compensator with an interactive structure that is
the inverse of the plant, so that the plant and control system function together as a <I>non-
interactive system</I>, which can be controlled by separate control loops. A deviation in any one
of the output variables, such as product size, can then be corrected without influencing the others.
<P ALIGN=center>
<IMG SRC="2by2.gif" HSPACE=10 WIDTH=275 HEIGHT=193 ALT="2x2 model">
<P ALIGN=center>
<I>A 2&#215;2 model of an interactive multivariable system</I>

<H3>Measurement techniques</H3>

The applicability of process models and the effectiveness of automatic control depend on fast on-
line instrumentation being available. Far fewer variables can be measured with sufficient accuracy
on milling circuits using existing technology than are required for a full description of the process.
Although the control strategy can be implemented using conventional instrumentation, Mintek
specializes in the development of new measuring technology. Innovations in this area include a
unique method for monitoring the angle of the <A HREF="hum.htm">cyclone-underflow
discharge spray</A>, which is used to indicate circuit conditions and cyclone efficiency, and a <A
HREF="pse.htm">particle-size estimator</A> that uses this measurement to estimate the cyclone
product size.

<H3>Applications</H3>

Mintek's milling control strategy was first <A HREF="mvc_appl.htm">applied in industry</A> in 1981 on the No. 1 milling plant
at East Driefontein Gold Mine. The mill capacity increased by 7 to 8 per cent, and the power
consumption decreased by about 12 per cent. Subsequently, the technique was extended to the
control of autogenous or run-of-mine (ROM) circuits. These are considerably more difficult to
control than conventional circuits, due to the variability in the feed size and hardness.
<P ALIGN=center>
<IMG SRC="on_off.gif" WIDTH=290 HEIGHT=183 HSPACE=5 ALT="on-off test">
<P ALIGN=center>
<I>Stabilization of product size</I>
<P>
Additional improvements include an optimizer, which extends the range over which the product
size can be controlled, and optimizes the throughput at a specific product size by dynamically
adjusting the load in a ROM mill so that the circuit operates at peak efficiency.
<P ALIGN=center>
<IMG SRC="mvc_opt.gif" WIDTH=290 HEIGHT=183 HSPACE=5 ALT="optimization">
<P ALIGN=center>
<I>The control and optimizing strategy</I>
<P>
The control strategy is used on several conventional and ROM circuits in industry. Continued
R&#38;D is aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the system by incorporating further
improvements.

<H1 ALIGN=center>The hydrocyclone underflow meter</H1>

The hydrocyclone classifier is an important link in the milling process. The product size has a
critical bearing on the efficiency of downstream processes such as flotation and leaching, while
the underflow characteristics influence grinding conditions in the mill. Sub-optimum cyclone
operation therefore severely hampers all aspects of mineral recovery.
<P>
Typical problems experienced with hydrocyclones on milling circuits include
<UL>
<LI>roping and/or choking, resulting in very coarse particles leaving the circuit

<LI>short-term fluctuations in the product particle size.
</UL>
The hydrocyclone underflow meter (HUM) was developed on-plant by Mintek to monitor the
efficiency of  the cyclone, and to give warning of the onset of these undesirable conditions so that
they can be corrected before large losses ensue.
<P>
The HUM provides for the first time a continuous, reliable measurement of the angle of discharge
of the cyclone underflow spray. The shape of the underflow has traditionally been used by skilled
operators to gauge the performance of a milling circuit and to determine the necessary actions to
improve it. The HUM makes use of an empirical relationship, derived by Mintek, between the
underflow angle and  cyclone performance, to
<UL>
<LI>ensure correct classification

<LI>avoid costly downtime due to cyclone chokes

<LI>reduce the amount of operator attention required.
</UL>
The measurement signal from the HUM also provides valuable information on the overall
performance of the circuit.
<P>
The simple HUM controller uses a standard controller linked to the mill-return water or the
variable-speed sump pump supplying the feed to the cyclone. Operation of the cyclone can thus
be automatically controlled at the required cutpoint and sharpness of separation.  The underflow
angle measurement is also used as an  input signal to the Mintek 
<A HREF="pse.htm">particle-size estimator</A> (PSE), which forms part of a broader control strategy for the milling circuit.

<H2>Technical specifications</H2>

The contact paddle and counterweight are designed to allow the paddle to ride on top of the spray
without entering the cone or losing contact. The resulting angle is converted into an electrical
signal that can be used for indication, monitoring, and control. The transmitter is protected against
the ingress of moisture, water, and slurry, and can work under the harsh operating conditions that
are normal at cyclone underflows. Installation is simple, and the instrument requires only minimal
maintenance.

<H1 ALIGN=center>Particle-size estimator</H1>

Particle size measurement is the most crucial parameter for good mill control, as well as providing
the basis for subsequent recovery processes such as flotation and leaching. However, conventional
on-line instruments that measure particle-size distribution are expensive, difficult to calibrate, and
depend on the taking of a representative sample from the slurry stream.
<P>
Mintek's particle-size estimator (PSE) overcomes these limitations by using a novel
technique to evaluate the product particle size of hydrocyclone classifiers.
<P>
The classification characteristics of a fixed-geometry cyclone can be determined if the flowrate
and density of the feed to the cyclone are known. The only other variable determining the
characteristics of the product streams is the particle-size distribution of the feed. Early work on 
the <A HREF="hum.htm">hydrocyclone underflow meter</A> (HUM) showed that the angle
of the cyclone underflow contains information on the particle-size distribution of the cyclone feed
stream. The additional information supplied by the HUM therefore allows the product size to be
calculated.
<P>
By means of step tests on an industrial milling circuit, the particle size of the cyclone overflow
product was successfully modelled as a combination of  the underflow angle, cyclone feed density,
and flowrate. The circuit used for the development work was already fully instrumented, and the
PSE was found to be slightly more accurate than the existing online ultrasonic system
<P ALIGN=center>
<IMG SRC="pse.gif" WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=243 ALT="HUM vs ultrasonic measurement">
<P>
The PSE uses signals derived from the total slurry stream, thus providing a more consistent and
reliable measurement, while avoiding the need for complex, high-maintenance sampling
mechanisms. The instrument is applicable to a wide range of slurry types and densities.
<P>
A further major advantage is that the PSE can be calibrated directly for any particle size. Most
other systems are based on the measurement of a fixed particle size (74 &#181;m is convenient for
ultrasonic methods), which is then translated into the measurement of interest. The PSE would
therefore be particularly suitable for the online size analysis of industrial minerals, where the size
specification is often critically important.
<P>
The HUM/PSE can be used as a stand-alone particle-sizing system. It can also be incorporated into
Mintek's <A HREF="mvc.htm">wider control scheme</A> for the optimization of milling circuits.

One of Mintek's greatest strengths is its ability to take concepts from the small laboratory scale
to full pilot-plant studies, with particular emphasis on integrating the various unit operations
into a balanced flowsheet. In addition to testwork at Mintek, pilot plants are often run on-site 
in industry for extended periods.
<P>
<STRONG>Milling and sample preparation.</STRONG> Facilities exist for conventional, autogenous, and stirred
milling. For bulk sample preparation, there is a crushing plant with a capacity of up to 20 t/h,
and a variable-speed run-of-mine mill with a capacity up to 5 t/h feed. Special
capabilities include mill-liner design and mill-circuit auditing. These facilities are available 
for the evaluation of circuit design and optimization.
<P>
<STRONG>Physical separation processes.</STRONG> The techniques used include gravity, magnetic, and electrostatic
separation. A mobile over-the-bed jig is available for on-site testwork.
<P>
<STRONG>Flotation.</STRONG> Flotation testwork is carried out from the bench scale to 
continuous pilot-plant operation, at feed rates of up to 1 t/h, depending on circuit configuration. 
There are two integrated pilot plants for milling and flotation, one for sulphide minerals 
(refractory gold, PGMs, and base metals) and the other for industrial minerals.
<P>
<STRONG>Leaching.</STRONG> A full range of equipment is available for conventional

<H1 ALIGN=center>The NIMCIX Contactor</H1>

The NIMCIX contactor is a multi-stage adsorption column that operates on 
the fluidized-bed principle.  It can be used for the continuous extraction of a variety of metals
and nonmetallic ions from unclarified solutions,  slimes, and dilute pulps using ion-exchange
resins or activated carbon. The contactor is equally suited for continuous adsorption and
continuous elution.
<P>
<IMG SRC="nimcix.gif" ALIGN=left VSPACE=10 HSPACE=20 WIDTH=165 HEIGHT=325 ALT="NIMCIX column">
<H2>Operating principle</H2>

The NIMCIX contactor operates according to the principle of reverse flow, so that the
movement of the adsorbent is intermittent and countercurrent to the flow of solution.
<P>
The column is partitioned into a number of stages by perforated plates. The feed solution
flows upward, fluidizing the adsorbent (carbon or resin) in each stage. The flow is interrupted
periodically to allow the absorbent to settle. A short period of reverse flow then transfers the
absorbent downward between the stages. Loaded adsorbent is transferred out of the
lowermost stage for elution, and regenerated absorbent is introduced hydraulically into the top
stage of the column. The operating cycle is completely automated.<BR CLEAR=left>

<H2>Advantages</H2>

The main advantage of continuous adsorption, as opposed to batch adsorption, is high
processing efficiency. Countercurrent operation means that the fresh adsorbent entering the
loading column is contacted with the least concentrated solution, which results in the
maximum removal of the desired species.
<P>
Since it uses fluidized-bed operation, the NIMCIX column can handle unclarified solutions, or
even dilute pulps. Additional advantages are:

<UL>
<LI>reduced capital and operating costs, 
<LI>a lower rate of absorbent abrasion compared with agitated contactors.
<LI>reliable and trouble-free operation,  requiring minimal supervision.
</UL>

The contactors have been scaled up easily and successfully to large diameters.

<H2>Applications</H2>

<STRONG>Uranium</STRONG><BR>
Mintek originally developed the NIMCIX contactor in collaboration with the Atomic
Energy Corporation of South Africa to extract uranium from unclarified leach liquors using
ion-exchange resins.  Four commercial plants were built, the largest of which (the Vaal Reefs
South plant, which is still in operation) has columns 4 m in diameter and a design throughput
of 1000 cubic metres per hour.
<P>
<STRONG>Gold</STRONG><BR>
NIMCIX has been adapted  as a very effective scavenger for the recovery of additional
gold from low-grade plant solutions such as return-dam solutions,  spillage waters, and
thickener overflows, as well as from heap-leach solutions, using activated carbon. The largest
commercial plant built has three 1.7 m diameter columns and a capacity of 305 000 cubic
metres of return-dam solution per month.
<P>
The effectiveness of a NIMCIX column in recovering gold from dilute cyanided pulps
containing up to 20 per cent solids has also been demonstrated, with recoveries of over 99 per
cent from a feed pulp containing 2 ppm gold.  Potential applications of the
carbon-in-pulp-in-column (CIPIC) route include treatment of the cyclone overflow in circuits
that use milling in cyanide.
<P>
<STRONG>Water purification</STRONG><BR>
NIMCIX processes are currently being evaluated for the decontamination of industrial
effluents, acid mine drainage, and saline groundwaters. This work is being supported 
by <A HREF=" http://www.und.ac.za/und/prg/projects/mining.html">postgraduate research</A>

<UL>
<LI><strong>Process development</strong><BR>
A range of laboratory and pilot-plant equipment is available for testwork either at Mintek or
on-site. Process design, sizing, and costing can be undertaken for full-scale plants.

<LI><strong>Evaluation of absorbents</strong><BR>
Mintek tests and evaluates absorbents with regard to
  <UL>
  <LI>loading capacity
  <LI>kinetics of the loading process
  <LI>extent and rate of the elution of adsorbed species
  <LI>ease of elution and regeneration of the absorbent.
  </UL>

<LI><strong>Process optimization</strong><BR>
To optimize the process, Mintek evaluates
  <UL>
  <LI>the efficiency of available procedures for adsorbent regeneration
  <LI>the cost of reagents for elution and regeneration
  <LI>the compatibility of reagents and adsorbents with the conditions - 
for example, pH in the adsorption circuit.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Certified Reference Materials</H1>

Imagine a bulk carrier containing 100 000 tons of ore, lying in port
waiting to be offloaded. Crippling costs mount up. The purchaser refuses
to accept delivery - he believes that the grade of the consignment is
lower than that specified by the supplier.  
<P>
Fortunately, such a scenario is unlikely to occur today, thanks to
the international system of certified reference materials (CRMs). These
are materials that have been analysed by many different laboratories,
so that values can be assigned to certain of their properties or constituents. 
These values are accepted with confidence world-
wide. CRMs are used internationally as standards to check the
results of analyses that are in doubt, and to calibrate analytical equipment.
This is particularly important when new analytical techniques are being
developed and tested.  
<P>
Certified reference materials made from local materials, the
South African Reference Materials or SARMs, are prepared in South
Africa under the auspices of the South African Committee for
Certified Reference Materials (SACCRM), which is appointed by the 
South African Bureau of Standards.
<P>
Mintek has to date prepared and certified sixty-two SARMs -
mainly for the important South African mineral exports such as
gold-bearing materials, PGMs, chromium, iron and manganese ores,
phosphate rock, ferro-alloys, andalusite, various coal materials,
vanadium pentoxide,  and reference materials for the heavy-mineral
industry.
<P>
Each purchaser of a SARM receives a comprehensive
certificate, which includes instructions on the use of the
material, a list of all the collaborating laboratories, and other
valuable information.
<P>
Further information about SARMs, including how to order, is
available from the 
<A HREF="http://africa.cis.co.za:81/direct/sabs/sabs.html">South
African Bureau of Standards</A>. 
<P>
Mintek issues a detailed report in respect of each SARM that it prepares,
containing details of the preparation and analysis of the
material by the collaborating laboratories, the statistical
analysis of the analytical data, and the assignment of certified
values and their confidence limits. These reports, which are free 
to bona fide purchasers, can be obtained from Joey Noortman <A

<H1 ALIGN=center>Energy studies</H1>

Energy is often a major component of the variable costs of metallurgical processing. For
example, the production of one ton of ferrochromium consumes about 4000 kWh of electrical
energy, and one ton of coke (as reductant).  Electricity constitutes 40 per cent of the total
operating costs of the process.
<P>
The energy requirements of each project must be carefully assessed to determine whether
savings can be made without sacrificing performance. This is done by investigating in detail
the energy balance across the entire operation. The cost of energy is an escalating factor, and 
estimates of the energy consumption of a project, both at its start and during its operating life,
can have a great influence on its viability and location.
<P>
The metals sector accounts for more than half of South Africa's industrial usage of electricity,
and more than one-third of the country's coal consumption (excluding that used for power
generation and synthetic fuels. Ninety per cent of the total energy in the sector is consumed by
just five industries - primary steel and aluminium, ferrochromium, manganese, and titanium
(slag production). Mintek has investigated the effect of possible changes in technology on
these requirements, taking into account the projected demand for metals, particularly
aluminium, and the effect of various factor on energy consumption.

<H1 ALIGN=center>Process design</H1>

Process design involves a series of steps, with each succeeding one going into more detail. We
handle a range of projects, which vary from the conceptualization of processes to the design of
full-scale plants from processes that are piloted in Mintek's R&amp;D divisions.

<UL>
<LI>A process description is prepared. This is a description of the consecutive stages, or 'unit
operations', that  make up the complete process. 

<LI>A block flow diagram is compiled. This is a graphical representation of the process
description (instead of a description of the route, we now have a road map). The process flow
diagram is a  more detailed 'map', which shows all the equipment and the principal controls.

<LI>Mass and energy balances are drawn up for the process. These data, which represent the
flowrates of the raw materials, reagents, and products, and the energy inputs at various stages,
are usually added to the process flow diagram. Our 'road map' now shows the distances
between the towns, giving us a much better picture of what the journey involves!

<LI>An equipment schedule is prepared, listing the items of equipment needed for the
proposed plant, and their specifications. The designers can now proceed to draw up the basic
plant layout and site plans.
</UL>

<H2>An example ...</H2>

A conceptual study was recently done on the treatment of concentrate from a new nickel
orebody, which is in the development stage. Several alternative processes were examined,
each involving smelting of the concentrate, followed by hydrometallurgical treatment of the
matte and slag streams to produce electrolytic nickel, copper, and cobalt, and a residue
containing platinum-group metals.
<P>
Detailed theoretical mass/energy balances were calculated using information from the
literature, our own knowledge of the unit operations, and software packages for simulation
and flowsheet design. This information was used to calculate the capital and operating costs of
each process route.
<P>
The results of this work added valuable input to the overall feasibility study being conducted
by the mining company, and enabled the various flowsheets to be ranked, and the best ones to
be selected with a high degree of confidence. The information gained will greatly enhance the
cost-effectiveness of the subsequent (and much more expensive) testwork.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>SABS-0259 Accreditation</H1>

The  Analytical Science Division's reputation for reliability and high quality of results is recognised
by the South African Bureau of Standards (SABS), who have granted us an SABS-0259
Accreditation.
<P>
SABS-0259 is a comprehensive guide to good laboratory practice, which encompasses general
requirements pertaining to calibration and testing laboratories. The code is, for all intents and
purposes, identical to the ISO Guide 25, which forms the basis for the European Standard
EN45001 and the British NAMAS Standard M10.
<P>
Apart from the confidence gained by having the quality of the work formally recognised by an
outside authority, SABS-0259 status also satisfies the needs of Mintek's clients. More and more
of these are themselves becoming ISO 9000 listed, and thus require that contract work is carried
out by organizations that are also listed or accredited.

<H1 ALIGN=center>Development of the CIP Process</H1>

The use of activated carbon to adsorb gold from cyanide solution was patented as early as 1894.
but did not receive much attention until the 1950s. Until that time, there was no method for
eluting the gold so that the carbon could be recycled (it was initially burnt so that its gold content
could be recovered). Also, the recovery of gold by filtration and zinc-precipitation had developed
into a highly efficient process.
<P>
In 1973, the Homestake Gold Mine in Nevada began recovering gold directly from cyanide
pulp with activated carbon, using an elution method developed at the US Bureau of Mines in the
early 1950s. CIP was first used to treat only the slimes fraction of the ore (which would be
difficult to filter in the conventional process) - at that stage the process had not been applied to
total ore streams, and screening methods had not been devised to separate the fine granular
carbon from the leach pulps. However, the scale of the operation was fairly large (70 kt per
month), and it was evident that the process held considerable potential.
<P>
Mintek started experimental work on the use of activated carbon in cyanidation pulps of whole
ores shortly after Anglo American Research Laboratories (AARL) developed their own process
for the elution of gold from loaded carbon. Although there was considerable scepticism as to
whether the process could be adapted for the very large tonnages handled on South African gold
plants, the results of laboratory tests were sufficiently encouraging for a 20 t per day pilot plant
to be built at a local gold plant. The laboratory results were repeated successfully on this plant,
and it became clear that the process could provide opportunities for the recovery of additional
gold, as well as significant savings in capital and operating costs.
<P>
Pilot plants were operated at more than a dozen gold mines over the next 10 years. Once the first
full-scale plants had been established,  adsorption pilot plants were often operated alongside  the
larger ones This was a particularly useful way to assess the influence of various factors on the
efficiency  of adsorption from a particular ore, and hence on the efficiency of the operation. It was
much easier (and less disrupting for production) to change the conditions on the small-scale plant
and to evaluate the results, than to do so at the full scale.
<P>
Each of these pilot plants contributed to the bank of information that has been accumulated (and
is continuing to be built up) on all aspects of CIP, enabling the South African gold-mining industry
to design, install, and commission virtually any size of plant with confidence.
<P>
<IMG SRC="presbran.gif" WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=166 HSPACE=15 ALT="President Brand" ALIGN=left>
<P>
The first local full-scale CIP plant, processing 30 kt of calcine per month, was commissioned at
President Brand Gold Mine in August 1980. This was followed a year later by the first gold plant
in South Africa that was committed to CIP for primary production, a 100 kt per month Beisa
plant.

The CIP process comprises at least seven separate unit operations or sub-processes, each of which 
required considerable development to make it suitable for treating large tonnages of run-of-mine
pulp. Some of the more <A HREF="CIPtech.htm">important developments</A> are listed below.

<HR>
<A NAME="Fundamental"></A>
<H2>Fundamental studies</H2>

Several major detailed research projects had to be undertaken to resolve problems such as
<UL>
<LI>the nature and structure of activated carbon, and the evaluation of carbons manufactured
from different raw materials

<LI>the chemistry involved in the adsorption of gold and other competing species, and the factors
affecting adsorption

<LI>the elution of adsorbed gold from loaded carbon

<LI>the electrowinning of gold from solution

<LI>the development of mathematical models to assist understanding the relationship between
aspects of the process such as the gold content of the feed, the carbon concentration, rate of
adsorption, gold loading on the carbon, solution barren value, gold 'lock-up' in the plant, and the
number of adsorption stages required.
</UL>
These fundamental studies have provided a firm foundation for the development of the CIP
process. In particular, mathematical modelling, which is essential for correct plant design and
operation, has advanced to such an extent that it is now often possible to design entire plants from 
the results of a few laboratory tests and computer simulation, without the need for expensive
piloting.
<P>
[<A HREF="#Top">Top of page</A>]
<HR>

<A NAME="Pumping"></A>
<H2>Pumping and agitation</H2>

The transfer of partially loaded carbon granules between the stages in a CIP plant is an important
operation. Abrasion of the granules should be avoided as much as possible, since fine carbon
particles leave the circuit, and the gold that they take with them increases the overall gold loss.
The early plants used airlifts for carbon transfer, probably because this method was used at
Homestake. With the advent of larger CIP plants, investigations began into the use of pumps, and
the more recent installations use recessed impeller pumps.
<P>
The agitation efficiency within a CIP contactor is an important parameter governing the rate of
extraction of gold, since even distribution of the carbon is essential to ensure adequate contact
between the carbon and the pulp. Increased agitation rates increase the rate of gold loading
significantly, but also increase the rate of carbon breakage, and both of these factors must be must
be taken into account when designing an agitation system.
<P>
[<A HREF="#Top">Top of page</A>]
<HR>

<A NAME="Removal"></A>
<H2>Preliminary removal of over-sized material</H2>

The fine screening of large volumes of pulp to remove woodchips (which might blind the
interstage screens)  and oversize ore particles (which would be screened out with the carbon and
accumulate in the circuit) constituted a major problem in the development of the CIP process for
whole ores, and needed a great deal of collaborative testwork. The continuous linear-belt screen
developed by Anglo American and Delkor Technik proved to be very successful, and is a good
example of how innovations sparked by the requirements of CIP are being applied in other
processes.
<P>
[<A HREF="#Top">Top of page</A>]
<HR>

<A NAME="Interstage"></A>
<H2>Interstage screening</H2>

Pulp flows through a CIP plant continuously, whereas carbon is transferred intermittently. A
screening system must therefore be used to retain the carbon while allowing the pulp to pass
through.
<P>
Air-cleaned submerged screens were employed in South Africa from the beginning, rather than
the external screens that had been used at Homestake. The introduction of the equalized-pressure
air-cleaned (EPAC) screen, developed by Mintek, was an important step, which overcame the
problem of the screens blocking if the pulp head across the screen became too high. Many
modifications have been made to the initial design to suit installation requirements and simplify
maintenance.
<P>
[<A HREF="#Top">Top of page</A>]
<HR>

<A NAME="Elution"></A>
<H2>Elution</H2>

Two methods of elution are used on South African CIP plants - the Zadra procedure developed
by the US Bureau of Mines, and the Anglo American Research Laboratories (AARL) method. 
In the Zadra procedure, hot, dilute caustic 
solution is recirculated continuously between the elution column and the electrowinning section.
The AARL procedure involves pre-soaking the loaded carbon in hot, concentrated caustic cyanide
solution, followed by elution with hot de-ionized water. The Zadra procedure is simpler to
operate, but slower. The AARL procedure is faster and more flexible, in that gold can be
recovered from the eluate either by electrowinning or by zinc cementation, and both techniques
are used on South African CIP plants.
<P>
Mintek has participated in a number of investigations to optimize these procedures, and to identify
the advantages and disadvantages of each in particular circumstances.
<P>
[<A HREF="#Top">Top of page</A>]
<HR>

<A NAME="Acid"></A>
<H2>Acid washing of carbon</H2>

Collaborative work by Mintek and AARL revealed that the build-up of calcium carbonate on the
surface and in the pores of the carbon granules caused a  gradual decrease in its capacity to adsorb
gold. Periodic acid-washing was found to remove the calcium carbonate, together with other
undesirable components such as iron oxide. Washing with hot 5 per cent hydrochloric acid is now
used routinely, either before elution or after regeneration of the carbon.
<P>
[<A HREF="#Top">Top of page</A>]
<HR>

<A NAME="Electrowinning"></A>
<H2>Electrowinning</H2>

A novel electrowinning cell, designed by Mintek, overcame the low efficiencies of existing cells
by using six individual  steel-wool cathodes instead of the single one normally employed, with an
anode placed on each side of the cathodes. This increases the electrochemically active volume of
the cell 12-fold. The electrolyte flows though each of the 12 active sectors in sequence, thus
further increasing the efficiency of the design. The Mintek cell, which is 
manufactured in South Africa, has become the industry standard.
<P>
Most of the earlier CIP plants in South Africa installed electrowinning equipment, except where
facilities for zinc-dust precipitation already existed.
<P>
[<A HREF="#Top">Top of page</A>]
<HR>

<A NAME="Carbon"></A>
<H2>Carbon regeneration</H2>

During adsorption, many organic and inorganic substances accumulate within the pores of
activated carbon, gradually decreasing its adsorption efficiency. Elution removes some of these,
but thermal treatment in an atmosphere of steam or carbon dioxide is necessary to restore the
activity of carbon that has been loaded with organic materials. This operation has received a great
deal of attention in South Africa.
<P>
Regeneration involves drying, vaporization of volatile adsorbed matter, and thermal
decomposition and pyrolysis of the non-volatile matter. The objective is to recover the original
porous structure and activity with as little damage as possible to the carbon itself. Vertical kilns and rotary kilns,
externally heated by electricity, are the most common means of regeneration. Mintek has
developed a novel resistive-heating furnace - the <A HREF="Minfurn.htm">Minfurn</A>. This furnace, which is based on the
principle of electrical resistance heating within the carbon, is used on several CIP plants in
southern Africa and overseas.
<P>
[<A HREF="#Top">Top of page</A>]
<HR>

<A NAME="Instrumentation"></A>
<H2>Instrumentation</H2>

The development of instruments to monitor the many interacting variables in the CIP process, and
to improve its efficiency, has been essential. The Debex <A HREF="http://www.mintek.ac.za/MaC/c2meter/c2meter.htm">C2 
meter</A>, an ultrasonic on-line instrument developed at Mintek to measure the carbon 
concentration in adsorption vessels, is used successfully on CIP plants in South Africa and abroad.
<P>
[<A HREF="#Top">Top of page</A>]
<HR>

<A NAME="Analytical"></A>
<H2>Analytical procedures</H2>

All new chemical and metallurgical processes need analytical procedures to provide rapid result
that are sufficiently accurate to be used for control and optimization. Old procedures are seldom
adequate for the analysis of new materials with unusual concentrations of the desired elements,
or with new combinations of elements that interfere with the determination.
<P>
Three main methods are used for the analysis of activated carbon in the laboratory. When analysis
for only gold is required, the most rapid method is X-ray fluorescence. When a number of
elements have to be measured, either atomic emission spectrometry using inductively coupled
plasma or atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) is used. The emission method is preferred

<H1 ALIGN=center>The CIP Process Today</H1>

Since the first CIP operation was commissioned in 1980, no further conventional plants have been
built in South Africa for recovering gold from newly-mined ore or from residues. There could be
no better demonstration of the fact that CIP has been accepted by industry as being superior to
the former technology. In fact, CIP has become the preferred method for gold recovery world-
wide, for several reasons.

<UL>
<LI><H2>Lower costs</H2>

The capital cost of a CIP plant is significantly less than that of a comparable conventional plant.
Economic evaluations have shown that this factor can be as low as 60 per cent, even when the
relatively large amount of gold that is 'locked up' on the carbon in a CIP plant is taken into
account.  CIP plants can also be built and commissioned more quickly. Cost comparisons between
mines are difficult, due to differences in the individual operations, but it appears that the operating
costs of  CIP are only slightly lower. In some cases, the carbon-in-leach (CIL) process can, by
combining the leaching and adsorption sections, bring about a further reduction in the capital
costs.
<P>
<LI><H2>Higher recoveries</H2>

Lower losses of soluble gold are possible on CIP plants. In addition, CIP offers the opportunity
for recovering additional gold. In several instances, the washed residues after the CIP process
contain less gold than they would have contained after cyanidation alone. It thus appears that
extra gold is dissolved or desorbed from the pulp during the adsorption stages of CIP. An
additional gold recovery of 0.03 g/t is
equivalent to about $33 million per year for the CIP circuits installed in South Africa alone. 
<P>
<LI><H2>Simplicity of operation</H2>

The operation of a filter plant is primarily an engineering function, and constant attention is
needed to maintain low gold values in the tailings. CIP operation, on the other hand, 
requires specialized metallurgical knowledge, and the plants can be easily controlled to their
optimum operation by metallurgical staff.
<P>
<LI><H2>Versatility</H2>

The majority of gold-mining activities throughout the world are concerned with 
lower-grade near-surface ores. The low costs of CIP, and the short start-up periods,
make such operations an attractive proposition, even when the gold price is depressed. These ores
often contain clay or shaley materials, which do not filter well and increase the soluble losses from
filtration plants, but which do not materially affect a CI operation.
</UL>

In 1995, there were 42 primary carbon-adsorption plants (i.e. not counting operations on tailings
from conventional plants) in South Africa, with an annual capacity of over 91 million tons per
annum. The largest plants in the world, in terms of tonnages treated, have been designed,
constructed, and operated on the Witwatersrand to recover the last vestiges of gold from the
dumps remaining from earlier activities. Without CIP, it is doubtful that such huge re-treatment
operations would be viable - yet carbon-adsorption technology is equally suited for gold recovery
on the small and medium scale.

Although CIP has now reached the stage where it can be considered to be a mature technology,
Mintek continues to interact closely with the Chamber of Mines of South Africa and various
mining groups at home and abroad, to further improve and refine the process, and to assist new
operations to become established.

<H1>The Minfurn</H1>
<H2>Carbon-regeneration furnace</H2>
<P>
With every adsorption cycle in the <A HREF="CIP.htm">CIP
process</A>, activated carbon loses some of its ability to
adsorb gold,  owing to contamination by organic materials.
Thermal regeneration decomposes these materials and restores the
original activity of the carbon, thus minimizing the loss of
soluble gold. <P>

<IMG SRC="minfurn.gif" HSPACE=30 ALIGN=right ALT="The Minfurn">
<P> The Minfurn is a novel apparatus for the regeneration of 
activated carbon, which uses <A HREF="#Direct">direct resistive
heating</A>. It has several important  advantages over
conventional carbon-regeneration equipment: <UL> <LI>Continuous
operation <LI>Smaller size than equivalent kilns and
batch-operated furnaces <LI>Fewer moving parts, and thus lower
maintenance costs <LI>More efficient energy utilization
<LI>Refractory walls that resist high temperatures and corrosion
<LI>A unique <A HREF="#Control">control strategy</A> that does
not rely on thermocouples to maintain the temperature. </UL>
Owing to its small size, simplicity, and high efficiency, the
Minfurn is more economical to construct and operate than
conventional units. <BR CLEAR=right> <P> Tests since 1988 have
shown that the Minfurn is capable of restoring most spent
carbons that are fouled with various contaminants to virtually
virgin quality. <P> The first industrial Minfurn, with a
capacity of 3 kg of carbon per hour,  was installed on a small
CIP plant in 1991. Since then, units with thoughputs of up to
250 kg/h of dry regenerated carbon have been installed at gold
plants in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Brazil, and Chile.

<P>
<H2><A name="Direct">Direct resistive heating</A></H2>

In the Minfurn, the temperature required for regeneration is
generated within the carbon, by means of an electrical current
passed through the carbon bed, rather than externally. This
means that the transfer of energy to the carbon is virtually 100
per cent. The highest temperature prevails in the carbon, and
not in the furnace structure, which leads to increased furnace
life. The heating chamber can be made of insulating refactory
materials, which are much better suited to the high temperatures
and corrosive environment within the furnace than the metal
tubes used in other furnaces and kilns. Also, there are no
heater elements that require frequent replacement. 

<P>
<H2><A name="Control">Minfurn control strategy</A></H2>


Conventional regeneration furnaces and kilns use thermocouples
to control the temperature of a chamber surrounding the heating
elements.  This temperature can vary considerably from the
actual temperature of the carbon. The Minfurn maintains the
optimum regeneration temperature by controlling the temperature
of the carbon bed itself. <P> The Minfurn control strategy makes
use of the fact that the electrical resistance <I>(R)</I> of a
carbon bed is strongly related to its temperature. When the
furnace is started up from a cold state,  the discharger is off
and the furnace inventory is stationary.  A fixed voltage
<I>(V)</I> is applied across the axis of the carbon bed. The
resulting current <I>(I=V/R)</I> causes the carbon to heat up.
As the temperature <strong>increases,</strong> the resistance
<strong>decreases</strong>,  and hence the current
<strong>increases</strong>. The current can therefore be used as
an indication of the temperature. <P> The current (temperature)
is allowed to increase up to a pre-determined set-point, at
which the discharger is activated. This removes hot carbon from
the bottom of the furnace, and allows the cooler and somewhat
moist carbon to gravitate into the top of the furnace. This
counters the temperature increase, the resistance increases, and
the current decreases. <P> The discharge rate is regulated so as
to keep the current (temperature) constant.  This ensures a
constant and instantaneous match between the carbon throughput
and the power required for maintaining a constant temperature
profile. <P> <A HREF="minfurn2.htm">Technical specifications</A>

<BODY>
<H1 ALIGN=center>Intermetallic compounds</H1>

Intermetallic compounds, often called 'bulk intermetallics', differ in a number of important ways
from conventional metal alloys. Conventional alloys consist basically of a disordered solid solution
of one or more metallic elements. They do not have any particular chemical formula, and are best
described as consisting of a base material to which certain percentages of other elements have
been added. In chemical terms, alloys are mixtures of phases. For example, type 304, a popular
grade of stainless steel, has the composition Fe-18%Cr-8%Ni.
<P>
An intermetallic compound, on the other hand, is a particular chemical compound based on a
definite atomic formula, with a fixed or narrow range of chemical composition. An example is
the nickel aluminide Ni3Al.
<P>
The atoms in conventional alloys are linked with relatively weak metallic bonds, with the atomic
nucleii floating in a 'gas' of electrons that are able to move relatively freely (this is why metals
conduct electricity well). In contrast, the bonds in intermetallics may be partly ionic or covalent,
and therefore stronger. Alternatively, the bonding may be entirely metallic, but the atoms of the
individual elements take up preferred positions within the crystal lattice. This condition, which is
referred to as 'ordering', leads to an abrupt change in the mechanical properties of the material.
<P ALIGN=center>
<IMG SRC="ordering.gif" WIDTH=252 HEIGHT=102 ALT="disorder-order">
<P ALIGN=center>
<I>Disordered and ordered crystal lattices</I>

These phenomena give the bulk intermetallics their characteristic properties - high melting points
and great strength (particularly at high temperatures), but poor ductility. In these respects, they 
resemble the ceramics. Unlike ceramics, however, they have a metallic lustre, conduct heat and
electricity well, and can generally be processed by conventional metals technology.
<P>
Since the 1970s, intermetallic compounds have come into focus as high-performance materials. 
However, their  evolution can be traced back to <A HREF="beta_br1.htm">ancient times</A>, 
and they were used as constituents of conventional alloys long before their unique properties were
understood.

<H1 ALIGN=center>Beta bronze - the first high-tech alloy?</H1>

Intermetallic compounds are among the most exciting of the 'advanced materials'. Beta bronze is
also an intermetallic, but has been used for thousands of years. There is evidence in the
archaeological record that ancient metalworkers were aware that beta bronze has unique
properties that could be exploited by heat-treatment.
<P>
The smelting of bronze over 5000 years ago heralded the start of the serious use of metals. The
tin content of the earliest bronzes was rather erratic, but we know that the ancient smelters were
able to exercise much greater control over the composition after about 1400 BC. At this time, the
first artifacts intentionally manufactured from beta bronze appeared in China. These objects
include axe-heads, vessels, and ornaments.

<P>
The use of beta bronze offered great advantages over copper or alpha bronze for these articles,
because it can be heat-treated and worked to obtain a very wide range of mechanical properties.
This feature of beta bronze was not matched by any other material until steel was first <A
HREF="heatreat.htm">intentionally heat-treated</A> in about 900 BC.
<BR CLEAR=left>
<P>
The precursors of beta bronze, copper and alpha (low-tin) bronze, are relatively soft metals. They
can be hardened only by cold-working, which makes them brittle and decreases their usefulness.
Beta bronze, on the other hand, can be hardened by cold-working and by heat-treatment.
Although it is extremely hard and brittle when cooled slowly from temperatures above
586C, beta bronze becomes tough and ductile when it is cooled rapidly by quenching into
water. Hot-working at temperatures above 586C, followed by quenching and a modest
amount of cold work, generates a material with a good combination of hardness and toughness.
Such a range of properties, obtainable from a single material, proved attractive to the ancient
metalworkers, even though they did not understand the principles involved.

<H2>Transformations in beta bronze</H2>

Beta bronze is an <A HREF="intro.htm">intermetallic compound</A> in the copper-tin system, containing between 23 and
25 per cent tin. The beta phase is normally stable only above 586C - when cooled slowly
below this temperature, it decomposes into a fine-grained mixture of two separate phases - a tin-
poor bronze (alpha phase) and a brittle tin-rich bronze (delta phase), which forms a continuous
network coating the alpha phase. This is the reason why cast (slowly cooled) bronze of the beta
composition is hard, but very brittle.
<P>

The significance of the high-temperature beta phase was unknowingly recognised millenia ago,
when metalworkers discovered that these alloys could be easily toughened by hot-working,
provided that they were kept at a temperature high enough to prevent the brittle delta phase from
forming. When the hot metal is quenched, the temperature falls too quickly for the tin to segregate
into a separate phase, and it remains in solid solution in the alloy. The result is a reasonably
ductile, metastable material, which provided adequate toughness for early consumer products.

<H1 ALIGN=center>Heat treatment of steel</H1>

Copper melts at 1084C, and if copper ore is smelted together with tin the resulting bronze
alloy flows easily at about 950C. Pure iron, however, melts only at 1537C, which was
beyond the means of the early metalworkers. At the temperatures that their furnaces could reach,
iron was reduced from the ore in the solid state, producing a solid spongy mass mixed with slag
and unburnt charcoal, called a 'bloom'. This became the raw material of the smith. By hammering
on the  bloom, which was kept soft by frequently re-heating it, he could drive out the slag and
other impurities, eventually producing a bar of almost pure iron - 'wrought iron'.
<P>
Pure iron is, however, inferior to bronze in many respects - it is softer, and does not hold an edge
as well. Why, then, go to all that trouble? During the hot-working process, while the bloom was
being re-heated, small quantities of carbon from the charcoal in the forging furnace would diffuse
into the metal. <A HREF="#carbon">Alloying with carbon</A> increases the hardness and strength of iron dramatically. This
improved alloy is, in fact, a steel.
<P>
The hardness of steeled iron is increased still further if the red-hot metal is quenched - suddenly
cooled by plunging it into water. Although this technique hardens the steel, it also makes it brittle
and likely to break with use. However, if the quenched steel is re-heated for a short time, and then
slowly cooled, it gives up some hardness but also becomes tough and springy. This process is
known as tempering.
<P>
These metalworking techniques make use of the fact that the atomic
structure of the metal varies with temperature. These changes are immensely important, for
they enable metallurgists to vary the properties of steel according to the purpose for which it is
intended. If they did not take place, our metals technology might still be based on copper and
bronze.

<H2><A NAME="carbon">The role of carbon</A></H2>

The amount of carbon that can be dissolved in iron depends on the arrangement of atoms in the
crystal lattice. At normal temperatures, iron has a body-centred cubic (bcc) structure. This
material, which is termed ferrite, can contain only a few hundredths of a per cent carbon. At
temperatures higher than about 906C, however, the atoms rearrange themselves to form a
face-centred cubic (fcc) lattice. This structure, which can accomodate up to 1.7 per cent carbon
in solid solution, is called austenite, after Sir William Roberts-Austen, a renowned 19th-century
metallurgist.
<P>
What happens, then, when an iron-carbon solid solution is slowly cooled? At some temperature
above 723C (exactly which temperature depends on the carbon content), the iron atoms
start to revert to the ferrite structure. The carbon atoms do not immediately come out of solution,
but diffuse to where the lattice is still face-centred cubic, thus creating carbon-rich zones in the
carbon-free ferrite. When these areas are saturated,  carbon starts to precipitate from solution.
This process is completed at 723C, when all the austenite has been converted to ferrite.
<P>
The carbon that precipitates from solid solution is deposited in fine lamellae of 'cementite', an iron
carbide with the formula Fe3C, which alternate with layers of surplus ferrite. This structure is
called 'pearlite', due to its iridescent appearance under the microscope.
<P ALIGN=center>
<IMG SRC="phases.gif" WIDTH=425 HEIGHT=310>
<P>
Cementite has similar properties to <A HREF="intro.htm">intermetallic
compounds</A> - it is extremely hard, but brittle.
A steel consisting of pearlite alone (0.8%C), which combines the hardness of  cementite with
the ductility of ferrite, would be too hard for structural use. (Pearlite is, however, the basis 
of high-strength steel wire and rope.) The most common types of structural
steels are low-carbon (less than 0.3%C), which have excellent ductility and moderate strength.
Medium-carbon (0.3-0.7%C) and high-carbon steels are often hardened further by quenching,
which produces an entirely <A HREF="#martensite">different structure</A>.

<H2><A NAME="martensite">Martensite in steel</A></H2>

Cooling an <A HREF="#carbon">iron-carbon solid solution</A> precipitates a separate carbon-
rich phase only if the rate of cooling is slow enough for the alloy structure to remain in equilibrium
with the temperature conditions. With very rapid cooling, there is not sufficient time for the
reaction that forms pearlite to take place, and the carbon remains in solution. In this case, an
alternative transformation occurs. The alloy reverts to its low-temperature structure, which cannot
easily accomodate the carbon, and as a result the lattice becomes severely distorted. It is this
distortion that gives quenched carbon steels their great hardness.
<P>
Seen under the microscope, the transformed steel has a characteristic microstructure, consisting
of interlocking laths of a new phase, which result from the stresses due to the
transformation. This material is called martensite, after the German metallurgist Adolf Martens
who first observed the texture in about 1890.
<P>
Unlike the transformation to pearlite, the martensite transformation involves a structural change
only - no movement of the carbon atoms is involved. The process is sometimes referred to as a
'diffusionless' solid-state transformation.
<P>
Although the presence of martensite gives steel great hardness, it also reduces its toughness and
makes it brittle. Few steels, therefore, are used in the fully hardeded martensitic condition. 
The quenching stresses are generally relieved by a carefully controlled tempering treatment, which
involves heating the steel to a temperature between about 250  and 550C, depending on the
carbon content and the properties desired. This allows some of the carbon to precipitate from the
supersaturated solid solution as a finely dispersed carbide phase.

<H1 Align=center>Arc furnace for CDR project</H1>

The world's largest DC transferred-arc melter/smelter is being built in South Africa for Samancor's
Chrome Direct Reduction (CDR) plant at Middelburg Ferrochrome, which will be completed and
re-commissioned in 1996. 
<P>
The 56 MVA furnace, with a capacity of 100 kt of ferrochromium per anum, will use the
DC arc technology developed by Mintek in partnership with Samancor. South Africa is a
world leader in this versatile technology, which is used in Samancor's 40 MVA ferrochromium
furnace at Palmiet Ferrochrome, and has since been adapted by Mintek for ilmentite smelting and
the treatment of metallurgical wastes.
<P>
The CDR process uses a rotary kiln to partially reduce fine chromite directly, using coal as the
reductant and energy source. The highly metallized kiln product is fed to a downstream furnace,
which melts out the metal and reduces the rest of the oxide. The process typically uses 50 per cent
of the electrical energy normally needed for chromite smelting.
<P>
The CDR plant at Middelburg (the first in the world) was commissioned in 1990, using a three-
phase AC slag-resistance furnace as the melter/smelter. However, this furnace failed due to slag
attack on the refractory lining. The failure coincided with a major downturn in the ferrochromium
market, and ferrochromium furnaces world-wide were shut down or switched to other products.
With no pressure to maintain high production levels, the kiln at Middelburg was run intermittently,
and the product fed to the conventional furnaces or used for testwork.
<P>
When Samancor decided to install a new furnace, several years of operating experience had
confirmed the advantages of DC arc technology. Testwork at Mintek and in the industrial 
furnace at Palmiet had shown that the kiln product would respond well to plasma treatment.  In
particular, the DC process proved to be more versatile and controllable than the conventional
AC process. One of the key factors in the choice was that, if the kiln is down for an extended
period (for example, for major maintenance), then the furnace can be switched
to smelting of the raw material.
<P>
The furnace has been designed to facilitate the hot transfer of the ferrochromium product to
Columbus Stainless. The proven capability of the DC furnace to produce a speciality low-silicon
alloy has added technical and economic advantages in this regard.

Although South Africa is the world's foremost supplier of the strategic steelmaking metals
chromium, manganese, and vanadium, the country lacks sufficient reserves of other important
metals such as nickel. One of Mintek's major objectives is to promote the greater use (in alloys)
of metals that are important to South Africa's economy. Particular attention is paid to chromium,
the platinum-group metals, manganese, and vanadium. The most important use of chromium is
in stainless steels, and Mintek has consequently developed considerable expertise in the properties
and applications of these alloys.
<P>
The popularity of stainless steels could be boosted either by decreasing the cost of popular
austenitic grades, or by improving the properties of the cheaper ferritics. Mintek is active in both
these areas, and four specific alloys have been developed. Their nominal compositions and 
targeted uses are shown below.

The corrosion resistance of conventional stainless steels is inadequate in agressive acid
environments, such as those encountered in some chemical and mineral-processing industries.
Superferritic stainless steels based on chromium and molybdenum additions, with low interstitial
levels, are superior to many conventional austenitic grades, particularly with regard to pitting,
crevice, and stress-corrosion cracking. However, they are usually inferior in acid environments,
particularly those that are non-oxidizing or reducing. Where these conditions occur,  plants are
often forced to use the more expensive nickel-based alloys for critical components.
<P>
Research at Mintek into the effect of harsh environments has shown that when small alloying
additions of the platinum-group metal ruthenium are made to certain superferritic stainless steels,
their corrosion resistance becomes equivalent, or in many cases superior, to that of alloys such
as Hastelloy C-276. This effect is known as cathodic modification. The modified alloys have the
potential for application in boiling sulphuric acid at concentrations up to 30 per cent (by mass).
<P>
Acid pump impeller and front-plate sets, tested in dilute sulphuric acid at 95&#176;C at an acid-leach
plant, outlasted those made from CF-8M ( a casting equivalent of type 316 stainless steel) by up
to five times. Cast pump components made from the new alloy, which is known as 'Ruthalloy', are
now being manufactured by a local stainless-steel foundry, and the first units have been installed
in industry.
<P>
Ruthalloy has been designed to bridge the price gap between the less corrosion-resistant (but
widely used) type 316 stainless steel and the exotic superaustenitic stainless steels and nickel-
based alloys. It outperforms the more costly materials in hot reducing acids, and it also has better
corrosion resistance than competing alloys in acid environments that contain high levels of
chloride and fluoride ions.

<A HREF="#Top">Top of page</A>

<H2><A NAME="Vanadium">Vanadium-bearing stainless steels</A></H2>

The major use for vanadium is in carbon and low-alloy steels. Less than 1 per cent of vanadium
production is used in the manufacture of stainless and heat-resisting steels. Essentially, vanaduim
has been added only to improve mechanical properties.
<P>
The addition of vanadium to austenitic stainless steel is limited by its strong tendency to form
ferrite. However, large amounts could be added to ferritic stainless steels, since the solubility of
vanadium in ferrite is unlimited.
<P>
In conjnction with the Vanadium Technical Committee (Vanitec) in London, Mintek has carried
out a systematic study of the influence of vanadium on the properties of ferritic stainless steels,
with interesting results, particularly at the 4 per cent vanadium level.
<P>
Conventional ferritic stainless steels are normally brittle, with a ductile-to-brittle transition
temperature (DBTT) above room temperature, which has limited the use of this group of steels
to thin sections. Vanadium has a beneficial effect, and a 4 per cent alloying content shifts the
DBTT to around -40&#176;C. It is thought that the presence of finely dispersed vanadium carbide
particles within grains improves the toughness by removing the agglomeration of chromium
carbides along the grain boundaries.
<P>
The alloy containing around 4 per cent vanadium has better resistance to localized corrosion than
types 304 and 316. It is weldable, and resists rampant grain growth in the heat-affected zone
(HAZ). In particular, it has good formability provided that it is properly processed with titanium
stabilization. These properties, together with its good toughness, indicate its suitability for use
in plate form.
<P>
A commercial-scale melt is scheduled for the second half of 1996, and the first trial commercial
application is likely to be in heat-exchanger tubing.

<H2><A NAME="Low-Ni">Low-nickel austenitic alloy</A></H2>

Approximately two-thirds of the world's stainless steels are of the so-called '18-8' composition,
exemplified by the well-known grades type 304 and type 301, containing  from 17 to 19 per cent
chromium and 7 to 10 per cent nickel. These alloys have good corrosion resistance for most
common applications, and are easily formed and fabricated. For these reasons, they have become
widely accepted, and the processing techniques (cutting, bending, forming, drawing, and welding)
are well known.
<P>
The nickel content of these alloys represents a significant proportion of their cost (nickel being
a relatively expensive metal), and this situation is aggravated when the nickel price is high. There
is, therefore, an incentive to introduce a stainless steel that contains less nickel, but which has
similar properties to the 18-8 series. In particular, this material should be able to be processed in the
same fashion as 18-8, using the same equipment.
<P>
A large number of stainless steels with less than 7 per cent nickel have been proposed in the past, but 
all have suffered from some kind of drawback that has prevented their ready acceptance in
industry. The nickel content of most existing 'low-nickel' austenitics is still too high to make much
of a price difference, and their mechanical strength is too great for easy fabrication. Other
problems include poor corrosion resistance, and susceptibility to hot cracking.
<P>
Mintek has identified a balanced composition that avoids these common problems, and combines
excellent formability and corrosion resistance with a nickel content of only 3 per cent. The new
alloy has been evaluated for cutlery applications among others, and the material was sufficiently
formable to take the imprint of the manufacturer's quite complex design. This qualitative test is
used by some manufacturers to screen out unsuitable alloy compositions.

<P>
<A HREF="#Top">Top of page</A>

<H2><A NAME="12Cr">12Cr austenitic alloy for special applications</A></H2>

Traditional 12%Cr stainless steels have been produced with a martensitic or ferritic structure (or
a combination of both). Little development has taken place towards producing austenitic
compositions, where the structure is much tougher and resistant to brittle fracture.
<P>
Stable austenitic stainless steels are used where corrosion resistance, toughness, weldability, and
formability are prime requirements. For resistance to wear, particularly under conditions involving
impact, compressive stress, and metal-to-metal contact, Hadfield's manganese steel is popular.
However, this alloy has little inherent resistance to corrosion, and is not effective in corrosive
wear environments.
<P>
Metastable austenitic stainless steels are designed to be thermodynamically unstable, so that
plastic deformation at temperatures above <I>Ms</I> (martensite start) induces a martensite
transformation. The formation of martensite during strain increases the work-hardening rate of
the alloy, which can be beneficial in improving the formability of these steels, since necking is
delayed and the uniform strain rate is increased. This strain-induced martensite is more effective
in hardening than the martensite formed by solution-quenching of austenite (thermally-induced
martensite), and occurs by a different mechanism.
<P>
Alloys of low stability will start to form martensite at lower strains, but the hardness of the
martensite formed is ultimately determined by the carbon and nitrogen contents, as these
interstitial elements are the most potent hardeners. However, at too high an interstitial level, the
stabilizing effect of the interstitials (by depressing <I>Ms</I>) will outweigh their strengthening
effect. Also, too much carbon removes chromium from the matrix, and adequate corrosion
resistance will not be obtained.

By controlling the interstitial levels in a relatively cheap 12Cr-10Mn base alloy, a marked
difference in the mechanical properties can be achieved.

These alloys are being evaluated for use in corrosion-resisting rockbolts for strata control in
underground mines. They have similar mechanical properties to the low-alloy steels that are
currently used, but are far more economical than existing standard stainless grades. The austenitic
microstructure should ensure excellent toughness and resistance to fracturing. In particular, bolts
made from the metastable alloy are planned for use in areas that are prone to rock movements.

<H1 ALIGN=center>What is  Spangold?</H1>

Spangold is the name given to a family of gold jewellery alloys that  exhibit a unique natural
shimmering texture (the 'spangle') on their surfaces. For centuries, craftsmen have imparted
decorative finishes to gold by means of engraving, hammering, or etching. The texture of Spangold,
in contrast, expresses a change in the underlying crystal structure of the material. This
crystallographic transformation, which is found in only a small number of non-ferrous alloys, is
just one of the fascinating attributes of the class of advanced materials known as 
<A HREF="../intro.htm">intermetallic compounds</A>.
<P>
The Spangold effect is unique to gold <A HREF="sp_alloy.htm">alloy compositions</A> that
have been formulated specifically to undergo the necessary transformation. A simple 
heat-treatment process causes the alloy to undergo a solid-state
<A HREF="spantran.htm>phase change</A>, which is expressed on the surface of the material
as a myriad of small facets that modify the <A HREF="spanprop.htm">optical properties</A> of the alloy. If the transformation
is carried out under the right conditions, the brilliant iridescence that characterizes Spangold is
obtained.

<H1 ALIGN=center>Spangold alloys</H1>

Gold alloys suitable for use in jewellery have certain minimum requirements in terms of their
intrinsic value (gold content) and appearance. Good workability and castability are important for
ease of manufacture, and the finished articles should have good strength and wear resistance, and
resist corrosion and oxidation. As well as having all these attributes, the Spangold alloys are
required to undergo the necessary transformation.
<P>
The Spangold alloys were originally developed around the compound AuCu, which has a
composition of 75 weight per cent (18 carat) gold. Recently, another variant was developed,
which apart from having a higher gold content (23 carats), has the additional feature of a new
colour effect caused by the diffraction of light off the finely spaced lamellae in its microstructure.
<P>
By itself, the <A HREF="spantran.htm">transformation</A> in pure AuCu does not result in a sufficiently startling texture.
However, small additions of other metals, particularly aluminium, can dramatically enhance the
effect, and also have a beneficial influence on other properties.
<P>

<P>
The low melting range contributes to the castability and fabricability of Spangold. The high
hardness means good wear resistance, and the ability of the alloys to take a high polish. From
the wearer's point of view, the lower density has obvious advantages in larger jewellery pieces.
<P>
Spangold alloys also have a number of <A HREF="spanprop.htm">unexpected features</A>,
which further extend the versatility of this remarkable material.

<H1 ALIGN=center>The Spangold transformation</H1>

The Spangold effect is the result of a phase transformation that distorts the original crystal
structure of the material, resulting in a surface relief pattern. At temperatures above 408C, 
the gold-copper alloy is a disordered solid solution, with copper and gold atoms randomly
distributed thoughout the face-centred cubic crystal lattice. In this 'parent' phase, there is an equal
probability that a copper or a gold atom will be found at any lattice point. When the temperature
falls below 408C, the structure becomes ordered, and the gold and copper atoms migrate
to occupy alternating layers.
<P ALIGN=center>
<IMG SRC="spantran.gif" WIDTH=279 HEIGHT=179 ALT="Transformation">
<P ALIGN=center>
<I>Disordered (left) and ordered lattice structures</I>
<P>
Since the atomic radius of copper is less than that of gold, the cubic lattice distorts - it shrinks
along one  axis.
<P>
Although the shape of the crystal structure changes due to the transformation, the overall
dimensions of an article made of the alloy do not alter - a ring, for example, does not expand or
contract. This is because the cubic lattice can shrink along any one of its three crystallographic
axes (depending on the way that the plane of copper atoms is oriented). In the bulk material, 
adjacent domains distort in different directions, and the strain is 'averaged' throughout the
material. The transformed structure consists of parallel lamellae with different crystallographic
orientations,  giving rise to the characteristic texture seen under the microscope. It is these 'twin
bands', reflecting light from the surface of the article, that lend Spangold its attractive shimmer.

<H1 ALIGN=center>Unusual properties of Spangold</H1>

The fine details of the Spangold pattern depend on the nucleation and growth of the twin bands
within the individual alloy grains. An almost limitless variety is possible, and  no two patterns are
identical. Each pattern, therefore, constitutes a unique 'fingerprint' by which a particular piece of
jewellery can be identified.
<P>
Furthermore, the spangle can be polished off and regenerated at will, by simply re-heating the
alloy through the <A HREF="spantran.htm">transformation</A> temperature. This is due to the property of 'shape memory',
which allows some alloys to be deformed at one temperature and regain their shape at another
temperature. In practice, therefore, the pattern can be generated in two ways: either by slowly
cooling the parent alloy, or by heat-treating a surface from which the spangle has been removed
by either polishing or annealing. The latter method is the most convenient
way to spangle an article of jewellery. When the article is cooled after the heat-treatment, a new set of twin bands
may appear, producing  striking effects as the patterns intersect.
<P>
The deep yellow colour of gold, which is part of the metal's age-old mystique, is due to its
electronic structure. Since intermetallic compounds have different electronic configurations from
their constituent metals, we might expect Spangold to display some unusual colour combinations.
<P>
The addition of copper to gold shifts the reflectivity towards the red end of the spectrum, creating
the characteristic colour of 'red' gold. If part of the copper in Spangold is replaced by
aluminium, the colour is blached to shades of lemon and apricot. In this way, the colour range of 
Spangold can be varied to form a continuous series, from yellow through pink and red to hues of purple.

<IMG SRC="knife240.gif" ALIGN=left WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=208 HSPACE=15>
Intermetallic compounds with unusual properties are the basis of this novel family of gold
jewellery alloys. Drawing on fields in materials science as diverse as solid-state transformations,
colour in metals, and shape memory, Spangold represents an innovative departure from 
traditional jewellery materials. The characteristic shimmer of the alloys lends a new concept to
gold jewellery design, and gives added impetus to the wider use of intermetallic compounds as
practical materials.

<h1><center>Introduction to Secondary Teaching</center></h1>
<h2><center>EDT 190</center></h2>
<center>
<center><img  Align=absmiddle SRC="../Images/revenge.GIF"></center>
<br>
Introduction to Secondary Teaching, EDT 190, is a course required for all secondary certification students at <a HREF = "http://www.muohio.edu">Miami University</a>.  While the course is intended to assist students in making informed decisions about pursuing or continuing to pursue a career in teaching, students in the course also examine through readings and classroom observations the role and demands placed on members of the teaching profession.  It is anticipated that each student will begin to formulate a concept of teaching based on their understanding of historical perspectives of teaching, current practices of teaching, and future perceptions of needs for teaching.  Additionally, through clinical observation experiences, students will acquire basic skills needed to critically observe junior high school or high school classrooms.
<br>
<br>
Just as the central components of a standard syllabus are the grading rubric and the assignment schedule, so too the central component of this electronic syllabus is the <b>Course Calendar</b> which identifies the dates for the various activities and links the reader to additional information relative to specific assignments.   Since Introduction to Secondary Teaching is a credit/no-credit course, the need for a detailed grading rubric is minimal.  As stated on the <b>Syllabus</b> page, complete the activities in the prescribed manner and credit for the course will be earned.
<br>
<br>
What is different about this syllabus is the ability to complete assignments without turning in a single sheet of paper!  Almost all of the papers and reports assigned for EDT 190 are presented here as <i>forms</i>.  This allows the student to submit their assignments electronically by either typing on-line or importing text previously prepared.  This method of submitting an assignment allows the instructor to comment and critique the students work and return both the original and the comments quickly, legibly, and without the space limitations inherent on an assignment submitted on paper.

<br>
<i>Issues in Education</i>, EDT 422, allows individual students and/or student teams to collaborate with the instructor and peers to identify and conduct an investigation or complete a creative project that focuses on a specific problem or issue in education.  As a seminar with primary emphasis on intensive reading, research, writing, and interaction in student-selected areas of study with opportunities for analysis and reflection, the course format  includes class discussions, team work, student presentations, and writing projects.  The culminating activity will be an exhibition which demonstrates the student's work relative to the understanding or resolution of the issue or problem studied.
<br>
<br>
Just as the central components of a standard syllabus are the grading rubric and the assignment schedule, so too the central component of this electronic syllabus is the <b>Course Calendar</b> which identifies the dates for the various activities and links the reader to additional information relative to specific assignments.  Since <i>Issues in Education</i> is a seminar course, you will notice a lack of formal testing on the schedule.  However, as stated on the <B>Syllabus</B> page, there are specific writing, participation, and presentation requirements which must be completed to receive credit for the course.
<br>
<br>
What is different about this syllabus is the ability to complete many of the writing assignments without turning in a single sheet of paper!  Almost all of the papers and reports assigned for EDT 422 are presented here as <i>forms</i>.  This allows the student to submit their assignments electronically by either typing on-line or importing text previously prepared.  This method of submitting an assignment allows the instructor to comment and critique the students work and return both the original and the comments quickly, legibly, and without the space limitations inherent on an assignment submitted on paper.

<b>Course Goal:</b>
<blockquote>To provide preservice teachers the time, opportunity and encouragement to become reflective practitioners who are inquiry-oriented, agents of change, and life long learners.  
</blockquote>
<b>General Requirements:</b>
<blockquote>Each student is expected to attend and participate in each class meeting, listserve discussions, and individual instructor conferences, to engage in extensive independent study, and to design, implement and present a finished product related to an educational issue of their choosing.</blockquote>
<b>Expectations/Activites:</b>
<blockquote>The course will be a combination of independent study and research as well as peer/faculty group meetings.  You may choose to work individually or in groups of two or three.  You will research, study, discuss, and reflect upon knowledge and experiences acquired in the Miami Liberal Education Curriculum as it relates to becoming an effective educator.  The topic you select should be a specific problem or issue in education appropriate for your area of certification or interest.  It will be necessary for you to do intensive reading and thoughtful planning to conduct school or community-based research or to utilize other appropriate methodologies to study the issue you select.  At the conclusion of the course, you will present or exhibit the product of your study and research for peer and faculty critical review and evaluation.  It is recommended that the completed product become part of your professional portfolio.</blockquote>
<B>Course Format:</B>  
<blockquote>The instructor will serve as the facilitator/synthesizer throughout the semester.  The majority of the weekly meetings will discuss current topics of general concern and to hear each other's discussion of the readings and research topics assigned.  Some weekly meetings of the course will be working sessions to discuss and/or produce writing relating to your project and to support each other's efforts through feedback and suggestions.  A considerable amount of time is required of you outside of class.  Please use it to your advantage.</blockquote>

<b><a HREF="EvaluationCriteria.html">Evaluation and Criteria</a>: </b>

<b><a NAME="PROJECT">PROJECT</a>:  
</b>
<blockquote><b><a NAME="Proposal/Objectives">Proposal/Objectives</a> (10 points)</b>
<blockquote>Your proposal should clearly outline what you intend to accomplish, for whom, and why.  Therefore, include major goal(s) and the objectives that will help you meet the goal(s), a rationale that makes a strong case for why this project is worth doing, a profile of the target audience(s), and a description of the product(s) you will develop to serve project needs.  Carefully consider issues of scope, tone, access to key information and individuals, personal expertise, equipment needs, cost effectiveness, and all other pertinent inputs.</blockquote>
<b><a NAME="Literature Review/Bibliography">Literature Review/Bibliography </a>(10 points)</b>
<blockquote>This compilation will include any resource that can support your project.  First, find all you can from theory-based sources such a learned journals and books, then all other sources that will help you better understand your topic, the target audience, format, etc.  Other sources may include popular publications, non print media, on-line information, material from companies and organizations, interviews with key people, and more.</blockquote>
<b><a NAME="Fly or Die Analysis">Fly or Die Analysis</a> (15)</b>
<blockquote>Your project is designed to benefit a clearly identifiable target audience.  Therefore, you need to completely foresee all factors that could impinge on the audience's acceptance of the project.  This analysis might include considerations of time availability, demographics, distribution strategies, timing, skills/ability, appropriate formats and vocabulary - anything that if not addressed could interfere with the project's successful implementation.</blockquote>
<b><a NAME="Prototype Development">Prototype Development</a> (15)</b>
<blockquote>Once you clearly understand what the situation demands, create prototype versions of all products that will be used in the project.  Locate sample members of the target audience, and under controlled conditions, test to see how well the products work.  Carefully record all that occurs so you can you use your findings to refine the prototype products into final versions.</blockquote>
<b><a NAME="Project Presentation/Exhibition">Project Presentation/Exhibition</a> (30)</b>
<blockquote>You will be required to publicly share your adventure through your project with your classmates.  Each student or group will prepare a poster session presentation that showcases the process and the product they have developed.  Full credit will go to presentations that effectively and interestingly depict both aspects.</blockquote>
<b><a NAME="Final Product">Final Product</a> (40)</b>
<blockquote>The project and its component products in their final, refined form.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<b><a NAME="REFLECTIVE JOURNAL">REFLECTIVE JOURNAL</a> (40)</b>
<blockquote>Becoming a reflective education professional is a major course goal.  The reflective journal component requires that you systematically keep track of your actions, impressions, and emotions as you work through the capstone experience.  You will be expected to contribute each week, via simple email or Netscape form, a journal entry for review and comment to your instructor. Journal entries will be a part of  the discussion during  individual conferences with the instructor.</blockquote>
<b><a NAME="CLASS ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION">CLASS ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION</a> (40)</b>
<blockquote>Active participation is a key ingredient in the capstone concept.  Your participation will be monitored in several ways:  1) class attendance, 2) participation in listserve discussions posted by the instructor during the course of the semester, 3) participation as a discussant during final presentations, and 4) taking a turn as reading discussion leader.  Conscientious, effective performance in these areas will render maximum participation points.</blockquote>

<H1><CENTER>Contexts of Teaching</CENTER></H1>
In most forms of professional preparation, there exists a continuing tension between the realities of current practice and the ideals of desired reforms.  This dilemma becomes particularily acute when addressing the question of how  novices to the profession learn to teach without continuous, supervised observations and practice in the real world.  Case studies that present the portrayal of a problem situation confronted by a teacher allow for exploration of a variety of possible approaches that could be taken and yet provide for acceptable accounts of how the problem can be resolved may present the ideal middle ground between the unfettered fantasies of the dreamers and the unimaginative practices of the uninspired.  <BR><BR CLEAR=left>
<IMG  Align=right HSpace=5 VSpace=8 SRC="http://SecondSTEP.McGuffey.MUOhio.Edu/Images/PCKg.Small.GIF">Cases methods are a particular strategy of pedagogical transformation - a strategy of transforming more propositional forms of knowledge into narratives that motivate and educate.  Because they are contextual, local, and situated, case studies integrate what otherwise remains separated.  Content and process, thought and feeling, teaching and learning are not addressed theoretically as distinct constructs in case narratives.  They occur simultaneously as they do in real teaching; posing problems, issues, and challenges for new teachers that their knowledge and experiences can be used to discern. Case studies are more engaging, more demanding, more intellectually exciting and stimulating, more likely to bridge the vast chasm between principle and practice, and more likely to help pre-service teachers to learn to think like a teacher, going beyond the usual skills and knowledge that constitute the professional curriculum.  
<BR CLEAR=all><BR>Cases show little respect for disciplinary boundaries.  They are messy and recalcitrant.  They rarely admit to a single right answer.  They are therefore ideal for inducting the neophyte into those worlds of thought and practice that are themselves characterized by unpredictability, uncertainty, and judgment.  This course, through case studies, explores the interactions between the different constituents of pedagogical content knowledge to allow students to take the first steps toward making explicit their theories and beliefs about learners, curriculum, subject matter, and the teacher's role come together in the enterprise of teaching.
<BR><BR>
Just as the central components of a standard syllabus are the grading rubric and the assignment schedule, so too the central component of this electronic syllabus is the <A HREF = "Calendar.html">Course Calendar</A> which identifies the dates for the various case study discussions and links the reader to additional information relative to these and other assignments.  <B>The pages presented here are the syllabus for EDT 228</B>. Since this is a seminar class, the need for a detailed grading rubric is minimal.  As stated in the <A HREF = "Syllabus.html">Syllabus</A>, participation is the key to successfully meeting individual grade objectives.

What is different about these course materials is the ability to complete assignments without turning in a single sheet of paper!   Many of the assignments listed on the Course Calendar are presented as <I>forms</I>.  This allows the student to submit their assignments electronically by either typing on-line or importing text previously prepared.  This method of submitting an assignment allows the instructor to comment and critique the student's work and return both the original and the comments quickly, legibly, and without the space limitations inherent on an assignment submitted on paper.

As presented here, Foundations of Effective Teaching is the second course in the redesign of the secondary science certification program being undertaken as part of the Secondary Science Teacher Education Project (SecondSTEP).  This National Science Foundation funded grant addresses the development of <A HREF="http://SecondSTEP.McGuffey.MUOhio.Edu/Images/PCKgDiagram.GIF">pedagogical content knowledge</A> through experience and practice in diverse cultural and ethnic settings.  For more information on how you can participate, check out the <A HREF="http://SecondSTEP.McGuffey.MUOhio.Edu/SecondSTEP/Default.html">SecondSTEP Home Page</A>.

<B>Catalog Description: </B>
<BR>
Professional seminar for students in education.  Through the use of case studies, students will explore the interactions between the different constituents of pedagogical content knowledge, reflect on and analyze the apparent effects of changes in the learning environment on the different forms of teacher knowledge, and employ the results of these reflections and discussions to take the first steps toward making explicit his or her theories and beliefs about learners, curriculum, subject matter, and the teacher's role.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Course Objectives:</B>
<BR>
Logic and common sense suggests that one cannot teach what one does not understand.  However, teaching is more than the transmission of knowledge.  Effective teaching requires that the teacher possess both a knowledge representative of an academic discipline and the skills and experiences to translate that knowledge into the diverse, multi-faceted languages of the student.  Furthermore, effective teachers possess a special amalgam of content and pedagogy, called pedagogical content knowledge, that is a unique to their experience and environment.  Thus, the objectives of this course are: 
<BR>
<OL><LI>To examine through selected readings how the constituents of pedagogical content knowledge impact teaching.  The constituent knowledge bases to be examined are: content knowledge; general pedagogical knowledge; curriculum knowledge; knowledge of the learners and their characteristics; knowledge of educational contexts; and knowledge of educational ends, purposes, and values. 
<BR>
<LI>To explore through case studies and classroom discussions how awareness of the knowledge bases characteristic of pedagogical content knowledge fosters an understanding of effective teaching and promotes development of teaching environments that represent the community of learners. <BR>
</OL>    
<BR>
<B>Grading </B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Your course grade will be based on your class participation (25%), your <A HREF="PCKJournal.html">PCKg Journal</A> (50%), and your final reflection paper,  The Contexts of Teaching  (25%).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Assessment </B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In addition to participation in the case discussions, each student is required to maintain a pedagogical content knowledge  journal in which they record their reflections on the cases presented for discussion.  For each case, your journal should include your initial notes related to the focus questions.  These notes should be extended to include additional comments you feel are pertinent based on class discussions and conclude with a summary statement that reflects your reactions to the discussions surrounding that case.  This summary statement is your opportunity to express agreement or dissatisfaction with the analysis of the case, the proposed resolutions to the protagonists dilemma, or any other aspects of the  case.  It is also expected that your summary will include your perceptions of the impact the players in the case had on any of the many components of the teacher's pedagogical content knowledge.  While this summary entry need not be lengthy, it should be thorough and written for perusal by others.  That is, the summary should contain complete thoughts, with acceptable syntax, grammar and spelling, and clearly present your arguments.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<B>Evaluation </B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The instructor will read your journal entries throughout the term and provide  evaluative feedback regarding the completeness and content of the entry.  The content evaluation will focus on the identification and impact of the components of pedagogical content knowledge into your analyses of the cases.</BLOCKQUOTE>
