<h2><a name = "Westlaw">An Introduction to Searching WESTLAW</a></h2></center>
<h3><Centre>By Gian Medves, Computer Services Librarian</center></h3>
<p>
<I>This month's issue of LawLink features a quick guide to seaching WESTLAW.  It includes: guidelines for developing a search strategy prior to searching, information on navigating the database once you have begun your search, instructions for modifying your search once it is completed  and procedures for printing and saving once you have found the information that you require.</i>
<p>
WESTLAW is a large American legal database service. It contains over 700 databases of American and International legal materials including:
<p>
<uL>
<li> The United States Code.
<li> The U.S. Code of  Federal Regulations.
 <li> U.S. State laws and bills.
<li> American case law.
<li> The full-text of many law review and legal periodical articles.  A list of the periodicals    available on WESTLAW can be found on the Bora Laskin Law Library home page  at (URL=<a href="http://www.law-lib.utoronto.ca/resources/journals.htm">http://www.law-lib.utoronto.ca/resources/journals.htm)</a>.
<li>News and current information.
<li> Topical databases, etc. 
</ul> 
<p>
Note: WESTLAW uses a modified version of the QuickLaw search software. Many of the commands are the same or similar but there are some differences which will be pointed out in this guide.
<p>
To get on WESTLAW you must first sign-on to QuickLaw. Once connected to QuickLaw type <b>DB WL</b> to connect to WESTLAW. Once connected you will be presented with the WESTLAW copyright screen hit the <b><Enter> </b>key.  You will then be asked to identify your research session.  You must type in something (anything) at this point or the system will not let you continue. Once you do this, you will see  WESTLAW's opening menu and you can begin your legal research.
<p>
Searching WESTLAW can be divided into 3 basic operations:
 <p>          
  
	1) Query preparation<br>
	2) Examining search results<br>
	3) Downloading and printing<br>
<p>
<h3>1) Query Preparation:</H3>
<p>
<b>a) Identify the precise legal issue you wish to research.</b> 
<p>
Think about your research problem and write down the concepts or keywords that describe it best. For example, if you are searching for cases in which a doctor was sued for performing an operation that resulted in the amputation of a limb your keywords would include doctor, malpractice, amputation and limb.<p>
<b> b)Look for synonyms and alternate expressions. </b>
<p>
In this example you would also look for the words physician or surgeon and negligence and leg or arm. You do not want to miss any cases where an alternate term is used.
<p>
<b>c) Decide if any of the words in your query should be truncated to retrieve the various endings for a word root. </b>
<p>
In WESTLAW the truncation command is represented by an exclamation point <b>(!).</b>  In our example the word amputation can be truncated to amputat! to retrieve the words amputate, amputated, amputating, etc.
<p>
<b>d) Choose appropriate connectors (AND, OR, proximity indicator) for the word groups. </b>
<p>
The <b>AND</b> connector specifies that both terms being searched must appear somewhere within the same document (e.g. drunk <b>AND</B> driving).
<br>
The <b>OR</b> connector requires that at least one (or more) of your search words occurs in a document  (e.g. doctor or physician or surgeon). In WESTLAW, as in QuickLaw, a space between words is read as an implicit <b>OR.</b>
<br>
The proximity indicator offers a method for you to indicate in your query that you would like one or more words in your search to appear in a specific proximity to one another. For example, <b>fifth /2 amendment</b>  will look for fifth within 2 words of amendment; <b>verbal written /10 contract</b> will look for either the word verbal or written within 10 words of contract. The proximity indicator<b> /p </b>searches for terms in the same paragraph (e.g. hearsay <b>/p</b> utterance). The <b>/s </b>proximity indicator searches for terms in the same sentence.
<p>
<b>e) Determine if field searching is required. </b>
<p>
Databases on WESTLAW contain numerous fields. Field searching allows you to limit your search. To see what  fields are available in a particular database type <b>F </b>when you are in the database and a list of the fields will be provided.  If, for example, in our sample search involving doctors and malpractice we wanted to restrict our search to 1994 decisions we would add <b>and da(1994</b> (where <b>da</b> is the date field) to our search string.
<p>
<b>f) The final step before going on-line and conducting your research is to determine which databases to search.</b>  
<p>
Since WESTLAW has over 700 databases, a good way to start your research is by selecting a database from the WESTLAW  directory of  databases (WESTLAW Databasics) which is available in the Computer Lab or at the Circulation Desk. You can go directly to the database you have selected by typing in the database identifier. Alternatively, you can follow the menu of options which appears on the first screen. You can choose to search Federal materials, State materials, topical materials by area of practice, law reviews and periodicals, etc. If, for example, you chose to search Federal materials you will then be provided with a further menu of options including cases, statutes, legislative history, etc.  If you do not have a specific jurisdiction in mind, you can do a broad search in one of the global databases such as ALLFEDS, ALLSTATES, or JLR for a global database of journals and law reviews. The  <b>SC </b>(Scope) command displays a database description, coverage information and search tips when entered from a database or when followed by a database identifier (e.g. <b>SC SCT</b> will display the scope and coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court decisions database).
<p>
Our final search query would look like this:
<p>
<b>doctor physician surgeon and malpractice negligence and amputat! /10 limb arm leg and da(1994). </b>

<h3>2) Examining Search Results:</h3>
<p>
Once you have prepared a search query, you can go online and execute your search by typing the search terms that you have chosen and pressing enter. The next step is to examine your search results and determine if the cases retrieved are appropriate. WESTLAW provides several useful commands to allow you to page through your documents to determine if they are relevant. Once you are in a document you can use the<b> T</b> (term) command to display the next page containing your keywords. Your keywords will be highlighted so they are easy to see. <b>T- </b>displays the previous page containing your keywords. <b>P</b> (page mode) displays the next page of a document.<b> R</b> (rank) displays the next ranked document.<b> R#</b> displays a specific ranked document (e.g.  <b>R3 </b>displays document #3). The<b> L </b>command displays a citation list. If the documents retrieved are not relevant then you should consider modifying your search query.
<p>
<h3>2a) Modifying a Search Query </h3>
<p>
To modify your search type <b>Q</b>; your search query will then be displayed to the screen. At this point you can edit your search. You will need to decide whether to add more terms or to truncate existing terms. Another option is to take your search query into another database and see if you retrieve more relevant documents there. To transfer your query to another database type <b>SDB xxx</b> (where xxx is the name of the new database). To begin a completely new search type <b>S</b> and you will be given a blank query screen to start over. To return to the main menu in WESTLAW  type <b>DB.</b>
<p>
<h3>2b) Case History and Judicial Consideration</h3>
<p>
Once you have found an appropriate case or cases you can also use several WESTLAW services (Insta-Cite, Shepard's Citations, and Quick Cite) to show the history of the case, its judicial treatment by other cases, and all its parallel citations.  To retrieve a case history or verify a citation through Insta-Cite, type<b> IC</b> followed by the case citation.  Shepard's Citations display a comprehensive list of citing references. Once in a document type <b>SH</b>  for a display of the Shepard's record for the decision being displayed. Use Quick Cite<b>(QC) </b>to update a Shepard's citation with the most recent citing cases available on WESTLAW.
<p>
<h3>3) Downloading and Printing:</h3>
<p>
Documents may be downloaded to disk, retrieved into a word processing package and then printed.
<p>
To download, use your mouse to select the <b>Functions</b> pull down menu and highlight <b>AutoSave</b>  to save the entire document. Once you select <b>AutoSave</b>  you are prompted to name the file. The document(s) will then be downloaded to disk as a text file. To stop the downloading process, type <b>Alt-V </b> (the Alt key and &quot:V&quot: key on a PC) or press the <b>Command</b>  key plus the <b>Period</b>  key (on a Mac).  We recommend that you download retrieved documents to a file and print the file after you disconnect from WESTLAW. This will allow you to retrieve a downloaded file into word processing software where you may reformat the text and then print. If you try printing from WESTLAW and there is a problem (e.g. your connection is terminated or the printer jams), you may have to re-establish your connection and start your search process all over again.

To logoff WESTLAW type<b> OFF</b>  then press<b> <Enter> </b>   to return to QuickLaw. Type <b>OFF</b>   again to logoff QuickLaw.  Exit the QuickLink software by choosing <b>Exit</b>   or <b>Quit</b>   from the <b>File Menu. </b>

<h2><a name = "QL"> Searching Quicklaw: A Quick and Easy Guide </a></h2></center>
<p>
<h3><centre>By Gian Medves, Computer Services Librarian</centre></h3>
<p>
<I>The following is a brief guide to searching QuickLaw.  It features succinct instructions for
basic search strategies and commands that will be useful to students and faculty alike.  Whether you are using QuickLaw down in the computer lab, dialing in from home or from your newly networked office, keep this issue of LawLink on hand as a quick reference guide to online legal research.
</I><p>
QuickLaw is Canada's largest legal database service.  It includes reported and unreported cases from a variety of Canadian legal publishers.  QuickLaw's LAW/NET bulletin board service includes: &quot; Supreme Court of Canada decisions, which are added within minutes of their release by the court, as well as major court and tribunal decisions and related public documents which are added within two to ten days of being received from the court or tribunal&quot;.
<p>
Learning effective QuickLaw search strategies will save you time (and money, if you are at a law firm) as well as ensure that you receive the best results possible for your search. 
<p>
Searching QuickLaw can be divided into three basic operations:
<p>	
	1) Query Preparation <br>
	2) Examining search results<br>
	3) Downloading and printing<br>
<p>
<h3>1) Query Preparation:</h3>
<p>
<b>a) Identify the exact legal issue you wish to research.</b>
 <p>  
 Write down the concepts or keywords that describe your research problem best. For example, if you are searching for  cases in which a doctor was sued for performing an operation that resulted in the amputation of a limb, your keywords would include <b>doctor, malpractice, amputation and limb.</b>
<p>
<b>b) Look for synonyms and alternate expressions.</b>
<p>	
In this example you would also look for the words <B>physician or surgeon and negligence and leg or arm</B>. You do not want to miss any cases where an alternate term is used.
<p>
<b>c) Decide if any of the words in your query should be truncated to retrieve the various endings for a word root. </b>
<p>	
In QuickLaw the truncation command is represented by an exclamation point <B>(!)</B>.  In our example the word amputation can be truncated to <b>amputat!</B> to retrieve the words amputate, amputated, amputating, etc.
<p>
<b>d) Choose appropriate connectors <B>(AND, OR, proximity indicator)</B> for the word groups.</b>
<p>	
The <B>AND</B> connector specifies that both terms on either side of the <B>AND</B> must appear somewhere within the same document (e.g. drunk AND driving). 
<p>
QuickLaw reads a space between two words as an implicit <B>OR</B>. The implicit <B>OR</B> requires that at least one (or more) of your search words occurs in a document  (e.g. doctor physician surgeon).  
<p>
The proximity indicator offers a method to indicate in your query the proximity of one or more words to another word or group of words. For example, <B>charter /2 rights</B> will look for charter within 2 words of rights; <B>biological natural /10 father</B> will look for either the word biological or natural within 10 words of father.
<p>
<b>e) Determine if field searching is required.</b> 
<p>	
Databases on QuickLaw may contain up to 8 fields. Field searching allows you to limit your search. To restrict your search to a particular field use the <B>@</B> symbol followed by the field number. Usually field 2 is the style of cause, field 3 is the citation field, field 4 is the field containing the judge, court and date information. To see what the fields are available in a particular database type <B>F</B> when you are in the database and a listing of the fields will be provided. If, for example, in our sample search involving doctors and malpractice we wanted to restrict our search to 1994 decisions we would add <B>@4 1994</B> to our search string.
<p>
<b>f) The final step before going on-line and conducting your research is to determine which databases to search.</b>  	
<p>	
A good place to start, if you do not have a specific jurisdiction in mind, is to do a broad search in the DLR (Dominion Law Reports) database for reported decisions and the CJ (Canadian Judgments) database for unreported decisions. Once signed on to QuickLaw type <b>DB</b> and the database name to get into the database. There is an online database list <B>(DBL)</B> that describes what databases are available on QuickLaw.
<p>
Our final search query would look like this: <b>doctor physician surgeon and malpractice negligence and amputat! /10 limb arm leg and @4 1994 </b>
<p>
<h3>2) Examining Search Results:</h3>
<p>
Once you have prepared a search query you can go online and execute your search in an appropriate database.  To execute your search, type in the search terms that you have chosen and press enter.  You will then see a screen which indicates the number of &quot;hits& quot; found by the system.
<p>
The next step is to examine your search results and determine if the cases retrieved are appropriate. If the documents retrieved are not relevant then you should modify your search. QuickLaw provides several useful commands to allow you to page through your documents to determine if they are relevant. Once you are in a document you can use the<b> (locate)</b> command to find your search words anywhere in the document and see the context in which they appear. Your keywords will be highlighted so they are easy to see. Another useful command is <b>H</b> (highlight). When you are in a document you can type <b>H</b>  and QuickLaw will let you highlight any term or terms. You can then search for those terms using the locate command to see if they appear anywhere in the document.
<p>
<h3>2a) Modifying a Search Query</h3>
<p>
If your search query returned no documents or the documents that were returned do not appear relevant then you can modify your search. To modify your search type <b>M</b> and your search query will be displayed on the screen. At this point you can edit your search. You will need to decide whether to add more terms or to truncate existing terms. Another option is to take your search query into a different database and see if you retrieve more documents there. To transfer your query to another database type <b> S DB xxx </B>(where xxx is the name of the new database). To begin a completely new search type <b>S </b>and you will be given a blank query screen to start over. To return to the main menu in QuickLaw type <b> DB.</b>
<p>
<h3>2b) Case History and Judicial Consideration - QuickCite</h3>
<p>
Once you have found a relevant case or cases you can also use a QuickLaw service called QuickCite to show the history of the case, its judicial treatment in other cases, and all its parallel citations and sub noms. Once in a document <b> C</b> for a display of the QuickCite record for the decision being displayed. Cases appearing in a QuickCite record will have a &quot;T&quot; number next to them. To view these cases type<b> Txxx</b> (where xxx is the number of the case). Once you are in the case you can  note it up as well by typing the C command. Type <b> GB</b> to go back one step in the chain until you return to your original document.
<p>
<h3>3) Downloading and Printing:</h3>
<p>
Retrieved documents may be downloaded to disk, transferred into a word processing package and then printed.
<p>
To download, enter one of the following commands:
<p>	
To download the current document 	displayed on your screen:  <b>PL</b><br>
To download a specific rank number from your list of retrieved documents: <b>PLn</b><br>
To download rank(n) through rank(n): <b>PLn-n</b><br>
To download all retrieved documents: <b>PLALL. </b><br>
<p>
When you execute a <b>PL</b> command you are prompted to Save Document(s) to disk or Send Document(s) to printer.  If you select Save Document(s) to disk, you will be prompted to issue a file name and the QuickLaw document(s) will be saved as a text file. You should download retrieved documents to a file and print the file after you disconnect from QuickLaw. This will allow you to retrieve a downloaded file into word processing software where you may reformat the text and then print. If you try printing from QuickLaw and there is a problem (e.g. your connection is terminated or the printer jams) then you may have to re-establish your connection and start your search process all over again.
<p>
To restrict downloading to the first and last page and only those pages where a search term(s) appears type <b>TL</b> (term locate)  and then hit the return key; then type one of the commands listed above <b> (i.e. PL, Pln, Pln-n, PLALL). </b>
<p>
To download certain fields only, enter one of the following commands first then enter one of the PL commands.
<p>
<b>NH </b>= no header (this removes the Rank line) <br>
<b>LC</b>  = list cases (restricts display to fields 2, 3 and 4: title, citation and judge-court-date) <br>
<b>HNC</b>=  = headnote command (restricts display to fields 2, 3, 4 and 6: Keywords/Headnote). <br>
<p>
Once you have downloaded the desired files type FULL  to return to full display.
<p>
To log-off QuickLaw type OFF. Then exit the QuickLink software by choosing Exit or Quit from the File Menu.

<h2><a name = "Newadd"> Announcing a New Addition to the Bora Laskin Law Library World Wide Web Home Page </a></h2></center>
<p> 
<H3>by Anne Johnston, World Wide Web Technician</h3>
<p>
The Bora Laskin Law Library has recently added an  &quot;Alphabetical Listing of  Electronic Law Journals&quot: to its home page (URL=<a href="http://www.law-lib.utoronto.ca/resources/journals.htm">http://www.law-lib.utoronto.ca/resources/journals.htm)</a>.  It lists the law journals currently available on Lexis, QuickLaw and Westlaw, as well as those on the Internet that are available in full-text format. The list also includes holdings information where available and the Lexis file name or the Westlaw database identifier code to facilitate access to these journals in their respective databases.  
<p>
While many journals have home pages on the Internet, only a few provide access to actual full-text articles. For that reason very few links have been made to Internet sources for journals.  However, links will be added and updated as more full-text journals become available.
<p>
In addition, the list provides hypertext links to the Lexis, QuickLaw and Westlaw home pages. Through these home pages you can retrieve information on how to get passwords for each of these databases and how to connect to them  via the Internet.

<h2><a name = "virus"> Net-iquette: Guidelines for using E-Mail and for Controlling the Spread of Computer Viruses </a></h2></center>

<h3><center>
By Gian Medves<br>
Computer Services Librarian</h3></center>

Both e-mail and the Internet can be valuable tools for law students and legal researchers.  E-mail allows students to communicate with colleagues around the world and to subscribe to various law-related discussion groups. The Internet makes it possible to locate law-related sources of information worldwide. 
<p>
Use of  e-mail and the Internet carries certain responsibilites. E-mail should not be used as a forum to harass, abuse or offend others either intentionally or by accident. In addition, students should exercise caution when using the Internet as they may inadvertently download viruses onto their own computers or those in the lab.
<p>
Here are some guidelines for students when using electronic mail and some tips on how to avoid computer viruses.
<P>
<h3>E-Mail Confidentiality</h3>
 <p>
It is important to keep in mind that e-mail is not  confidential. Postmasters of mail systems are able to monitor and read any mail being handled by their post office. If you do not delete unwanted messages or if you save messages onto the hard drive in the Computer Lab, your e-mail can be read by other students.
<p>
<h3>E-Mail Etiquette</h3>
<p>
On the Internet, there are observed rules of e-mail etiquette called &quot; netiquette.&quot;  If you don't observe these rules, you will usually be admonished strongly by other Internet users.
<p>
The following guidelines are provided by the University of Toronto's Computing and Communications Centre and are intended to make people aware of some of the consequences of their actions when transmitting information through electronic mail.
<ul>
<li>Keep your messages short and to the point. Be clear in what you say and ask for. Ambiguous or vague questions often lead to no response at all.
<p>
<li>Be aware of the effects of upper-case letters in words. Depending on the context, the use of ALL CAPITALS will lead the reader to believe that you may be either shouting, highlighting an important point, or distinguishing a title or a heading. Some commonly used e-mail short forms appear in capitals, such as &quot;IMHO&quot; (in my honest opinion) and &quot;BTW&quot; (by the way).
<p>
<li>Limit the length of your lines of text because the lines could get truncated if they are too long for the recipient's e-mail software to handle.
<p>
<li>Do not use academic networks for commercial or proprietary work.
<p>
<li>Add your &quot; electronic&quot;  signature to the end of your messages. A signature should include your name, e-mail address, position and affiliation, and should not exceed four lines. This signature provides information on how others can get in touch with you.
<p>
<li>Be aware that sarcasm and humour do not work because computers cannot convey the inflection or tone in a person's voice, nor can they transmit facial expressions, gestures, or body language. Without the benefit of face-to-face communication, your joke may be viewed as a criticism. One way in which humour or mood is sometimes denoted in electronic mail is with the use of faces constructed from standard keyboard characters, such as the ones following this sentence: :-)  :-(  :-O  ;-)  :-} (Look sideways to view them.)
<p>
<li>Be careful of what you say about others.
<p>
<li>Use discretion when forwarding mail to group addresses or distribution lists. Do not forward mail without the author's permission. 
<p>
<li>Observe the behaviour of your e-mail correspondents for clues to what is appropriate. Inappropriate mail is often responded to with "flames," i.e. antagonistic criticism preceded by the warning text &quot; [FLAME ON] &quot;.</ul>
<p>
<h3>Virus Control</h3>
<p>
Computer viruses are malicious programs (or sets of instructions) which can be passed from machine to machine. These programs are generally designed to; replicate themselves, display messages, destroy data or software, or inhibit access by the user of the system. 
<p>
Computers in the Lab have virus protection software. However, it will only catch known viruses. New viruses are harder to stop. Usually, the only way to become aware of a new virus is to witness the damage it causes. At this point the remedy is to reformat the hard drive thereby losing any text files on that machine. It is important for students to make and keep regular backups of important files.
<p>
<h3>How can you tell if your machine is infected? </h3>
<p>
Recognizing that a system is infected by a virus depends on the type of virus itself. Some examples of known viruses and their effect include: 
<p>
The Stoned Virus: One version of this virus randomly displays the message "Your PC is stoned" on the screen. Ping Pong Virus: This virus plays a Ping Pong game on your screen. Cascade Virus: This virus manifests itself by randomly dropping characters from your screen to the bottom of the screen creating a pile of letters at the bottom. Some viruses, known as &quot;stealth&quot;   viruses, hide themselves on a system and are triggered on a specific date, for example the Friday the 13th Virus. Some viruses may result in slower response time as they tie up your system's resources. Others can prevent you from accessing files by altering directories and file tables.
<p>
<h3>Here are a number of ways in which a machine can become infected:</h3>
<p>
<ul><li>Using an infected diskette on a machine (infected diskettes are the most common way viruses are spread from machine to machine.)<p>
<li>Downloading infected software from a Bulletin <p>
<li>Board or using infected shareware<p>
<li>Pirating computer games.</ul> 
<p>
<h3>What should you do if you suspect that a virus has infected your machine? </h3>
<p>
Acquire the most recent virus detection and desinfectant program and install it on your computer.
If you are in the lab and suspect the computer has  a virus, stop using your machine and inform library staff.
<p>
<h3>What can you do to prevent your machine from becoming infected? </h3>
<p><ul>
<li>Back up your files regularly (at least weekly). Make separate backups of your data files and your software and store your backup diskettes in a safe and secure place away from your machine. Backups may be the only way to recover infected systems
<p>
<li>Do not use illegal or &quot; pirated &quot;software on your machine. This is against University policy.
<p>
<li>Do not use shareware programs unless you are absolutely sure that the programs are free of viruses.
<p>
<li>If you download programs from Bulletin Boards or other sites on the Internet, scan them for viruses before you use them. Download  the files to a temporary directory or to floppy disk then scan these files for a virus.
<p>
<li>If you bring any diskettes from home, scan them for viruses before using them in the lab.
<p>
<li>When you get new software for your machine, make sure it is shrink-wrapped and check the diskettes before using them on your computer.
<p>
<li>Make sure that your diskettes with software programs on them are write-protected. This prevents viruses from being copied onto the diskettes.
<p>
<li>If your &quot;new&quot; machine is in reality a recycled one, ask the individual installing your machine to do a &quot;low-level format&quot; of the hard drive. This will destroy any viruses that may be on the hard drive as well as get rid of illegal copies of software. If your &quot;new&quot; machine comes pre-loaded with software or if the hard drive is pre-formatted, scan the hard drive for viruses before you start using the machine.
<p>
<li>If you are sharing diskettes with someone else or if you use your diskettes on someone else's machine or a machine which is part of a &quot;pool&quot;, scan your diskettes before using them on your machine.
<p>
<li>If you know that your machine or any of your diskettes are infected or if you suspect a viral infection, do not use your diskettes on another PC. Your diskettes are most probably infected too and all you will accomplish is to spread the virus and infect someone else's machine!
<p>
<li>Do not boot your machine with a diskette that has not been scanned for viruses even if you think the diskette only contains data. Never boot your machine from a diskette created on another machine.
<p>
<li>If you normally boot your machine from the hard drive, make sure that there isn't a diskette in your diskette drive.
<p>
<li>Public-domain software should not be used until it is tested and labeled &quot;clean&quot;.
<p>
<li>All software should be acquired from reputable dealers. Non-shrink-wrapped software may be infected although there are known incidents involving spreading of viruses through shrink-wrapped software
</ul>

<p>
1) You will be able to "fix" things when you desperately need to print your paper or factum and the deadline is fast approaching. <br>
2) It will look good on your resume.<br> 
3) You will be helping fellow students<br>

<h3>Lexis/Nexis Passwords</h3>

Lexis/Nexis passwords have arrived.  Those students who applied for Lexis/Nexis passwords can pick them up from Gian between 9:00 am and 5:00 pm - Monday to Friday. Students wishing to acquire a Lexis/Nexis password can pick up an application form at the Circulation Desk.
<p>
<h3>UTORmail</h3>
<p>
Students can access UTORmail from either the Macs or the PC's in the lab. The software for accessing UTORmail on the Macs is Eudora 1.4.1. The instructions for configuring Eudora are available in the lab. The software for accessing UTORMail on the PC's is ECSMail 2.4. 
<p>
The PC's in the lab are "shared" machines; therefore students must configure and personalize ECSMail each time they use it. If you do not personalize ECSMail, you will encounter problems connecting to the mail server (i.e. you will get a message saying your user id or password is invalid). Or if you do happen to connect, then any messages sent will have someone else's name in the message header. See the PC lab manual for instructions on how to personalize ECSMail.
<p>
<h3>Computer Lab Etiquette</h3>
<p>
We have had several reports of law students abusing their computer lab privileges. The Library Rules of Conduct indicate that inappropriate behaviour may be sanctioned.  Excessive noise and abusive behaviour will not be tolerated. 
<p>
Please be aware that you must sign up for a computer whether you are using a Mac or a PC.  If you have not signed up for the computer that you are using you have no right to be there.  Who-ever has signed up for the computer in the appropriate manner is entititled to use that computer and to ask you to move. 
<p>
Further, we have heard that students are staying beyond their allotted time period. Just a reminder: students can only sign  for 2-hour blocks of computer time.  If you have signed for a specific block and find that your computer is already occupied, please ask the user to vacate the site immediately.  If you encounter opposition, call the Circulation Desk for help.
<p>
We have found evidence of food and drink in the lab. While it is tempting to eat as you work, DON'T DO IT!   The problem is twofold:  the food attracts rodents and vermin which can do extensive damage throughout the Library, and the drinks can so easily spill and damage the computers. So PLEASE DO NOT EAT OR DRINK IN THE COMPUTER LAB  OR ELSEWHERE IN THE LIBRARY.  The money we save on damage control  will benefit all of us.
<p>
The  lab security rules were established to protect the equipment and avoid the problems of vandalism and viruses, so please follow them. Do not prop the door open for your friends since this defeats the whole purpose of a secured room.  If you see anyone in the lab who is not a law student or faculty/staff member, please report this to the Circulation Desk. 
<p>
The computer lab rules exist for your benefit.  The computer lab is your facility.  Its smooth operation depends on your abiltity to cooperate with your fellow students and to follow the appropriate procedures.

<h2><a name = "Justice"> Canada's Department of Justice
 Introduces its New Home Page </a></h2></center>

The Justice Department has recently unveiled its new home page on the World Wide Web URL= <a href="http://canada.justice.gc.ca/">http://canada.justice.gc.ca/</a>  Its purpose is to "furnish citizens of Canada and of the world with information originating with the federal Department of Justice".
<p>
This home page contains a number of useful resource items for the legal researcher.  These include:
<ul>
<p>
<h3>Overview of the Department of Justice</h3>	
<p>
<li>News from the Department of Justice
<li>Recent Speeches
<li>Press Releases
<li>Judicial Appointments
<li>Subscription to JUSTICE-L
<p>	 
<h3>Government Initiatives</h3>
<P>
<li>Crime Prevention
<li>Dispute Resolution Project
<li>Law Reform and Multiculturalism
<p>
<h3>Laws</h3>
<p>	     
<h3>Bills and New Statutes</h3>
<li>DNA Bill
<p>
<h3>Consultations</h3>
<p>	 
<h3>Recent Department of Justice Conferences</h3>
<p>	
<li>Justice on the Electronic Highway
<li>Symposium on Digital Technolgies and Copyright (coming soon)
<p>
<h3>Publications</h3>
<p>
<li>Crown Counsel Policy Manual
<li>Information and Education Documents
<li>Reports and Analyses
<li>Other Publications
<p>
<h3>Other Resources in Canadian Law</h3>
<p>
<li>The Access to Justice Network (ACJNet) 
<li>Supreme Court of Canada 
<li>The Research Center in Public Law 
<p>
The Laws section of this home page will be extremely valuable to legal  researchers. It
contains:
<p>
<li>  Constitutional Laws of Canada (1867 - 1982): annotated and consolidated version of the Constitution of Canada, including the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, as prepared by the Department of  Justice (updated September 1, 1993).
<li>Criminal Code
<li>Consolidated Statutes
<li>Explanations on Statutes Structure
</ul><p>
The Consolidated Statutes section is particularly useful; it contains the "consolidated Acts updated to April 1995 as well as Acts of public general application that have been enacted since the 1985 revision". However, before using this service, you should be aware of the following warning: 
<p>
<b>"This consolidation has been prepared for convenience of reference only and has no official sanction.  For all purposes of interpreting and applying the law, users should consult the Acts as passed by Parliament, which are published in the "Assented to" Act Service, Part III of the Canada Gazette and the Annual Statutes of Canada and available in most public libraries."</b>
<p>
It also does not include the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite> and other acts still in force but not included in the 1985 or earlier revisions.
<p>
The consolidated statutes section is searchable using Folio VIEWS just like the CD-ROM version of the statutes that the library has available.  Through Folio VIEWS you can go directly to a particular statute through the contents icon.  If you are looking for a topic you can do a search through the query icon.  Once your search is completed you can view the results by clicking on the document icon.  If you get stuck, there is a useful help section, which will walk you through the search process.
<p>
This home page is up-to-date as of June 1995 and according to the Department of Justice will be updated regularly.

<h2><a name = "Welcome"> Welcome To All  Students  And Faculty,  Both New And Returning.</a></h2></center>

Those of you who have been reading <cite>LawLink</cite>  during the past year know that it contains a wealth of useful and timely information on developments in legal research and new legal information sources as well as library announcements. Because new technologies are offering more and more to the legal scholar and researcher, the emphasis in <cite>LawLink</cite>  has been decidedly electronic and will continue to be.
<p>
For the coming year, while students and faculty continue to &quot;get connected&quot;, we will bring <cite>LawLink</cite>  to you in paper format. The issues will also be available on the Library's World Wide Web page (see Anne Johnston's article in this issue) where we will attempt to provide hyperlinks to sources on the Internet that we mention in <cite>LawLink</cite> articles. By this time next year we expect you will be consulting <cite>LawLink</cite> online.
<p>
<cite>LawLink</cite>  appears 9 times a year. If any of you have research-related information to share with your colleagues, we hope you will think of contributing it to <cite>LawLink</cite>  by contacting our editor, Susan Barker. We are always anxious to receive your feedback and suggestions for making the newsletter as useful to you as possible.

Law Librarian

<h2><a name = "cyberspace"> The Bora Laskin Law Library
and  U of T's  Faculty of Law Enter Cyberspace </a></h2> by Anne Johnston </center>
<p>
<I>One of the library's summer projects was the creation of a World Wide Web (otherwise known as WWW or the Web) Home Page for the Faculty  and the Library.  Anne Johnston, who is the library's World Wide Web technician  and who has now joined the Information Services  Department as a circulation assistant, has written the following article which explains a little about the Web and describes our new home pages.</I>
 <p>
The Web is part of the Internet that utilizes  hypertext links to navigate cyberspace. It also uses multimedia (text, images, animation and sound) as a method of presenting information through Web pages. Web pages can be viewed via a variety of different browsers ranging from inline text browsers like Lynx, to sophisticated graphical user interface browsers such as Netscape, Mosaic and Cello.  Inline text browsers provide simple hypertext  links to the Web.  Graphical user interfaces like Netscape or Mosaic can best handle the multimedia aspects of the World Wide Web.  
<p>
Web pages are designed using HTML (HyperText Markup Language). HTML codes tell the browser how to display information presented in a page. HTML is an evolving language. Its specifications are being updated at an incredible rate. The Library and Faculty of Law pages, were designed using HTML 3.0 . This means that these pages are designed to take advantage of  Netscape's enhanced features and are best viewed using Netscape 1.1N  (available in the computer lab).
<p>
Individuals, corporate bodies and academic institutions present themselves to the Internet surfing community by means of WWW home pages. They usually provide introductory information and may contain multimedia elements including graphics, pictures, sound, as well as links to other documents. Links are words or images which are highlighted or underlined.  When clicked on with a mouse, these links will then connect to other documents. Home pages can also be located directly using a URL (Universal Resource Locator).
<p>
The Bora Laskin Law Library's Home Page URL=<a href="http://www.law-lib.utoronto.ca/">http://www.law-lib.utoronto.ca/</a>  includes:
<ul>	
<li>History of the library.
<li>Library hours.
<li>Library collection and UTCat.
<li>Loan periods and borrowing privileges.
<li><cite>LawLink.</cite>
<li>Useful law-related Internet sites, including law schools, legal materials, government documents and data, law journals and law associations, societies and organizations.
<li>Past Exams (April 1995 so far, more to come).
</ul>
 
The Faculty of Law Home Page URL =<a href= "http://www.law.utoronto.ca"> http://www.law.utoronto.ca</a> contains links to:
<ul>	
<li>The Faculty of Law Calendar.
<li>The Syllabus.
<li>Biographies of faculty, visitors and special lecturers.
<li>Faculty publications.
</ul>
Future additions will include:
<ul>
<li>What's New? 
<li>The Faculty's calendar of events.
<li>December 1994 exams.
<li>Reading lists (if available).
<li>University of Toronto, Faculty of Law Review.
</ul>
Please check out these pages and let us know what you think. Comments and suggestions can be sent to <a href="mailto: law.web@utoronto.ca">law.web@utoronto.ca.</a> If you find Internet sites that you think are interesting and relevant, please let Anne know either at the address above or at the circulation desk.

<h2><a name = "cdrom">CD-Rom Services at the Bora Laskin Law Library</a></h2></center>
The Bora Laskin Law Library has added many new services in our onging efforts to provide patrons with access to information through the latest  technology.  This issue of <cite>LawLink</cite>  will focus on the CD-Rom facilities available for use at the Law Library.  CD-Roms are fast and efficient research tools.  Research that could take up valuable time is finished in seconds.  When you are working on a paper or an assignment it pays to make use of the library's latest technology.  
<p>
Library patrons can use these CD-Rom services at the six workstations in the &quot;Online Services and CD-ROMS&quot; section of the library. Professors, graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Toronto, Faculty of Law also have full access to these CD's via the network in the computer lab.  Library users can print items retrieved from the CD-Roms,  but licensing restrictions prevent the library from allowing patrons to download material to disk. Although this new technology may seem daunting at first, the Reference Staff are available to provide training or answer any questions that you might have about our CD-Rom collection. 
<p>
The following is a list of all of the CD-Rom products that are available in the library as of June 14, 1995.

<h2><a name = "govt">Introducing Government Information in Canada: A New Electronic Journal on the Web</a></h2>
<h3>By Esther Wan<br>
Coordinator, Information Services</h3></center>
<cite>Government Information in Canada/Information Gouvernementale au Canada</cite> is a new electronic journal. It is  available on the Web at the following URL: <i>http://www.usask.ca/library/gic/index.html</i>.
<p>
The inaugural issue of this journal was released in the summer of 1994 and is a quarterly publication in electronic format. Each issue contains  information, discussion and debate on issues surrounding public access to information from all levels of government in Canada.  Contributors to the journal come from, academia, government, and the private sector.  
<p>
The editors have chosen to keep this journal entirely in electronic format for a number of reasons: &quot;Electronic publishing makes a significant part of the work (and cost) of a journal, in particular printing and distribution, essentially trivial... It is unlikely that the market in Canada can support a full-scale, conventional, paper journal in this area ... [and]... it is unclear who might publish such a journal..&quot;  The editors believe that the journal will &quot;...derive its legitimacy, not from its affiliations [but by] the quality of its contents and the integrity of the editorial process.&quot;
<p>
According to this journal's copyright policy, it's contents may be freely copied and distributed on condition that the journal and its contents remain unaltered, that the journal and its authors are credited, and that there is no charge for the journal or its contents. However, the rights for reprints for profit are reserved to the authors. Essentially then, this non-subscription journal is free for world-wide distribution!  You can obtain a copy of an article by having it sent to you by e-mail, sent to a local file, or printed from the screen.
<p>
In the Internet world where files magically appear and disappear constantly, it will be very interesting to see how successful this journal will be. Can an electronic journal survive?

<h2><a name = "parl">Changes to the Parliamentary  Publications Programme Recently Announced by Ottawa.</a></h2>
<h3>by Ann Morrision<br>
Associate Librarian</h3></center>
Severe cut-backs to the Parliamentary Publications Programme were announced on March 22nd by The Honourable Gilbert Parent, Speaker of the House of Commons and Chairman of the Board of  Internal Economy. Effective April 1st 1995, the evidence portion of the Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of Standing Committees will no longer be published.  Transcripts and their simultaneous translations will be available only to Members of Parliament, research staff and members of the Parliamentary Press Gallery.
<p>
In future, only the minutes of standing committee meetings will be published.  Typically, minutes are one page notices of where and when a particular committee met, who was there and who spoke.  The evidence portion, which was a verbatim record of committee proceedings, will no longer be published.  Therefore, lawyers, students, researchers and any member of the public who wish to find out what issues were discussed,  and what decisions or policy recommendations were made by these committees, will have no ready access to this information.  
<p>
Mr. Boudria M.P., spokesperson for the Board of Internal Economy indicated that these changes were made &quot;to further the board's commitment to streamline and modernise the operations of the House of Commons while reducing costs to the taxpayer&quot;. This all sounds very sensible and fiscally responsible.  However, cancelling the publication of the evidence portion  of the Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of Committees means that the Canadian public has no access to a vast amount of important  information. 
<p>
This decision to cut these publications is of great interest to librarians across Canada. They are concerned that in the name of fiscal restraint, all access to federal parliamentary proceedings will be denied.  This concern has been translated into action as librarians and library associations are contacting members of parliament, the Prime Minister, the Hon. Lucien Bouchard, Mr. Robert Marleau, Clerk of the House of Commons,  Mr. Peter Milliken, Chair of the House of Commons Committee on Procedure and House Affairs and Mr. Bruno Gnassi, Assistant Director of the Depository Services Programme, to express their concerns.  
<P>
No response has been received yet, but  Mr. Bob Desiamaux, Director of Communications of the  Speaker's Office, has indicated that these transcripts of evidence might be available eventually on the Internet, and discussions are being held with the Canadian Library Association regarding the possibility of eventually putting the transcripts on CD-ROM.
<p>
However, since publication of  the transcripts of evidence stopped as of April lst , the hope of reviving publication in another form seems very slim indeed.  The question now is - can Hansard be far behind?

<h2><a name = "taxpart">Carswell TaxPartner CD-ROM</a></h2>
<h3>Reviewed by<br>
Esther Wan, Coordinator, Information Services</h3></center>
TaxPartner is a comprehensive tool for Canadian tax researchers which incorporates Carswells major tax publications in a single resource on compact disc.  TaxPartner includes:
<ul>
<li>Income Tax Act
<li>Income Tax Regulations
<li>Income Tax Application Rules
<li>Selected Income Tax Remission Orders
<li>Income Tax Cases
<li>Income Tax Treaties
<li>Income Tax Conventions Interpretation Act
<li>Revenue Canada Views
<li>Department of Finance Technical Notes
<li>Interpretation Bulletins
<li>Information Circulars
<li>Advance Tax Rulings
<li>Canada Tax Service - Stikeman Analysis
</ul>
TaxPartner is updated monthly to ensure that the most up-to-date information is available .
<p>
TaxPartner uses the FolioViews 3.1 (Windows version) software as a means to navigate through the database and to search for particular material.  Library users may already be familiar with this type of searching. The Canada Statute Citator, the B.C. Statutes, and the Ontario Statute Citator infobases,  which are all currently available on the CD-workstations in the library use FolioViews software. 
<p>
The windows version of FolioViews gives the researcher the choice of using pull down menus, keystroke commands or the &quot;toolbelt&quot;, which is a panel of command option icons  on the left hand side of the screen.  FolioViews allows the user,  in addition to using the traditional method of reading a file screen by screen, to choose to &quot;jump&quot; between related documents on the infobase via hypertext links. For example, a section of the Income Tax Act may be linked editorially to other sections of the Act, to regulations, application rules, or leading court decisions on the topic in question. The user can move backwards and forwards between related documents by double clicking the mouse pointer on the appropriately marked icon.  In TaxPartner, a feather or text marked in green indicate a hypertext link.  FolioViews hypertext links and the windows environment make TaxPartner easy to use without extensive training, however, the first time user might still want to spend a bit of time looking through Carswell's accompanying documentation before beginning a search. 
<p>
To locate materials on this infobase, researchers have the choice of searching by table of contents or by keyword. The table of contents is the most straight-forward method for locating text on TaxPartner.  Clicking on the contents icon in the toolbelt brings up a general table of contents for the infobase.  Each item on the list is marked with a plus (+) sign which indicates that there is more infomation to be found under that heading.  A double click on the heading will reveal the sub-headings available.  Repeating this process will  lead to a single document which can be read screen by screen. 
<p>
Keyword searching is more time-efficient. First make sure that you are not in the table of contents mode.  Click on the &quot;query&quot; icon on the toolbelt and a search menu will appear. Enter the terms that you wish to search. TaxPartner will display all records containing the keywords in your search.  To move from one record to the next,  click on the scrollbar or on the &quot;next&quot;  or &quot;previous&quot; icons on the toolbelt.   TaxPartner  allows field searches (by case name, case citation, section number, or information circular number). Undoubtedly, Carswell's new TaxPartner will shave more than a few precious minutes off research time. Please drop by the Library and let us know what you think!

<h2><a name = "computer">Computer Lab Update</a></h2>
<h3>By Gian Medves<br>
Computer Services Librarian</h3></center>
Students may have noticed something new in the Computer Lab - Colour.  Due in part to a grant from the Provost's office, the Library has purchased 9  PCs and 9 Macintosh LC 630s. Each computer has a colour monitor, 12 - 16 megabytes of RAM, a network card, and upgraded software. The new computers will be in compliance with the  University's minimum requirements in order to provide students with access to new client server based software like UTORmail, UTLink and the Internet.
<p>
Law students will find that the new computers provide them with more computing power, more versatile word processing packages and greater access to legal information, whether it be available on commercial databases, on CD-ROM or on the Internet.
<p>
The new PCs come equipped with Windows for Workgroups as the main operating environment. The word processing packages available include Microsoft Word 6.0, WordPerfect for Windows 6.1 and WordPerfect 5.1 (DOS). These PCs have ethernet cards and are connected to the Library's Local Area Network (LAN) as well as the University's central network (UTORNet). These PCs can access Lexis/Nexis, Quicklaw and the Library's CD-ROM collection which includes such items as LegalTrac, the Statutes of Canada, British Columbia and Ontario, Carswell's Tax Partner, The Canadian Law List, and the UN Human Rights Bibliography (more titles will be added in future). In addition, students can travel the Internet via Netscape (an Internet browser) and access their e-mail via ECS-mail. Students can access the Library's online public access catalogue (UTCAT) via Telnet software.
<p>
On the Mac side of things the new LC 630s are System 7.5 machines and have the AT EASE software as a front end menu. These Macs are also connected to the Library's LAN and UTORNet. Lexis/Nexis and Quicklaw access is available as is Netscape for surfing the Net. Eudora 1.4.1 is the student e-mail software package available. The problem with sending e-mail messages longer than a screen has been fixed. In order to run Eudora students will have to exit the At EASE menu and run Eudora from their disks as before. The word processing package on these Macs is Microsoft Word 6.0. The LC 630s come equipped with super drives that will read an IBM disk so students working on Microsoft Word 6.0 on an IBM can bring their disks to a Mac and work on them there as well. The LC630s also have a conversion package called MacLink 8.0  that will translate a wide variety of word processing files. Students can access the Librarys online public access catalogue (UTCAT) via NCSA Telnet  2.5. The Library's CD-ROM titles will not be accessible from the Macs as most of the CD-ROMs are DOS or Windows based.
<p>
With these upgrades the Library has moved closer to its goal of providing law students with a <i>scholar's workstation</i> where they can do legal research online, retrieve relevant information and then incorporate that research into their papers with powerful and versatile word processing software.

<h3>World Wide Web Site at the University of Alberta</h3>
The following is a description of the world wide web site at the University of Alberta Faculty of Law.  Brent Pookhay, the computer instruction specialist at the Faculty, is developing the site, and has prepared this description. 
<p>
The World Wide Web (WWW) project makes multimedia, hypertext documents available
over the Internet. At the Faculty of Law, we have developed two WWW sites for our students, 
staff, and interested individuals throughout the world.
<p>
The first site is the Law Faculty Information System. It contains everything you would ever want to know about our faculty. It includes course listings and descriptions for every section of every course we offer. It also includes profiles of all faculty, including pictures and sometimes some sound clips as well! Students can keep up to date with what's happening around the school by clicking on the Law Centre Events link on our Web. There is also detailed information on all our special programs and research centres including the John Weir Library, the Health Law Institute, Centre for Constitutional Studies, Law Reform Institute, and the Indigenous Law Program.
<p>
We have also developed The Electronic Easement, A Property Law WWW Site. This site deals with issues of property law and trusts. People from all over the globe post updates on recent case law and statutes, full text articles, upcoming conferences, sharing of teaching plans and course outlines, and much more. After browsing the site, users can discuss issues on the EASMNT-L listserv.
<p>
Addresses for the sites are as follows:

<h2><a name = "supreme">Supreme Court Decisions on the Internet</a></h2>
<h3>by Susan Barker<br>
Circulation Services Supervisor</h3></center>
It is now possible to get access to Supreme Court decisions through the gopher at the Universit&eacute; de Montr&eacute;al, Facult&eacute; de droit, Centre de Recherche en Droit Public.  The database consists of decisions from January 1993 to the present.  The gopher at the Universit&eacute; de Montr&eacute;al can be reached through Netscape in the computer lab or via UTlink, either from the public access catalogue terminals in the library or by dialing into UTLink from home.
<p>
Netscape is the simplest and most efficient way  to connect to the Universit&eacute; de Montr&ecaute;al Gopher.   Instructions on how to use Netscape are in the computer lab manual. You can dial directly into the Universit&eacute; de Montr&eacute;al gopher on Netscape at the following URL: <i>http://www.droit.umontreal.ca/english.html</i>
<p>
Once you are connected, you will see a welcome screen and a list of services offered.  Select <cite>The Supreme Court of Canada (Experimental)</cite>  from the list and you will be taken to an introductory screen which gives you the option of &quot;selecting published rulings&quot; or  &quot;searching by key words&quot;.  If you choose the published rulings option, you will be connected to a menu which lists a number of volumes for you to choose from.  These volumes give you an alphabetical list which you can scroll through in order to find a particular decision. If you choose the search by keyword option, you will be taken to a screen which asks you to enter a search term.  You can search by keyword or keywords, partial word and also use the boolean connectors (and, or, not). With either method, once you have found the document you are looking for you can print or download it to disc by selecting either of these options from the Netscape file menu.
<p>
Outside the computer lab, you can access the Universit&eacute; de Montr&eacute;al  gopher through UTLink.  When you are using  UTLink you must provide the first letter of your last name and the last eight digits of the barcode on the back of your library card to access the Internet.  The system is menu driven,  so you must go through quite a few layers to get to the Supreme Court decisions.  Although this system is is not as simple to use as Netscape, it  does have the advantage of being accessible from home.
<p>
To connect to the internet,  select Item #7  <i>UTLink Campus information system</i> from the main menu.  Once this is selected you will see a list of options, select  the last option on the list (Dir) <i>Internet................Local & Worldwide Connections; guide</i> by moving the curser down until this line is highlighted and press enter. Once you have accessed the <i>Internet and Worldwide connections; guide</i> you will see another menu.  Select: (Dir) <i>Connections to Worldwide Gophers  and Veronica (from U. Minnesota)</i>  and press enter.  Under that heading you will see another menu giving a choice of locations to search.   Select <i>North America</i> from the <i>Connections to Worldwide Gophers  and Veronica (from U. Minnesota)</i>  menu and <i>Canada</i> from the menu after that.  You will see an alphabetical list of gophers available. Using your arrow key, select  <i>&quot;Universit&eacute; de Montr&eacute;al, Faculte de Droit, CRDP&quot;</i>  and you will be in the Universit&eacute; de Montr&eacute;al gopher.  From this gopher main menu select (Dir) <i>Supreme Court of Canada (Experimental)</i>.  Once you are in the Supreme Court database, you have the option of searching the complete decisions index or browsing through a list of rulings. You can only search for a single word; for example,  a search with the words blood transfusion locates all the records with the word &quot;blood&quot; in them.  You cannot print or download from UTLink, but if you have an e-mail address you can mail a decision  to yourself and retrieve it from your mailbox.

<h2><a name = "canadian">Canadian Legal Resources Available on the Internet</a></h2>
<h3>By Gian Medves<br>
Computer Services Librarian</h3></center>
There is a growing number of Canadian legal resources available on the Internet. Law students can access these resources from the Computer Lab via two software packages: <b>Netscape</b>  and <b>NCSA Telnet</b>.  <b>Netscape</b> is an Internet browser that enables you to search the Internet and retrieve files. It has a graphics interface and is quite easy to use. For further information on how to use Netscape refer to the section in the Computer Lab manual entitled Access to the Internet: Learning Netscape.  
<p>
A good place to start to access Canadian legal resources via Netscape is the WWW Virtual Law Library (at http://r106.law.unimelb.edu.au/HTML/virtual.html). (Instructions on how to connect to a WWW site can be found in the Computer Lab manual). Once connected you will see the following menu:

<p>
Students are urged to access these sites via Netscape and explore all that is available. Surfing  the NET is one way of discovering what is out there. The Internet is changing daily and one of the best way to keep up with the changes is to go surfing often.
<p>
<b>NCSA Telnet</b> is another software package that allows you to connect to various sites on the Internet and retrieve files. (Next month's issue of Lawlink will include a list of resources accessable through NCSA Telnet)

<h2><a name = "united">United Nations Human Rights Bibliography on CD-ROM</a></h2>
<h3>By Esther Wan<br>
Coordinator, Information Services</h3></center>
This  bibliography was compiled by the United Nations Library in Geneva in co-operation with the Centre for Human Rights. It contains over 12,000 bibliographic citations to UN documents covering 1980 to October 15, 1993. 
<p>
When selecting the <cite>Human Rights Bibliography</cite> from the main menu of the CD-ROM workstation, the researcher is faced with two choices: to search the complete database, or to pre-select by subject area or type of document. The first option is the most flexible method for the basic researcher. I have tried both methods and frankly speaking, found the pre-selection method very complicated (for some reason, the software does not allow you to create a subset of records as it claims). 
<p>
<h3>Searching</h3>
You can search the database by selecting one or all of the choices from the following list:  all words, title, subject, personal author, corporate author, UN issuing body, session, UN Document symbol, UN sales number or publication date. Once you have completed your search,  the screen will display the number of records that your search has found. Press &lt;enter&gt; and the screen will display a &quot;hitlist&quot; of these items. The hitlist includes the first few words of the title, the date, and the UN document number of each item. To find more detailed information for a particular record, move the cursor down to the record (the citation should turn blue) and press the &lt;Enter&gt; key. This record will  then show the full title of the document, the place and date of publication, the UN document number and the UN Issuing body. 
 <p>
<h3>Navigating</h3>
 The &lt;Escape&gt; key always takes you back a step, &lt;F1&gt; is the HELP key, the &lt;ALT&gt; key allows you use the pull-down command menus, and the &lt;F10&gt; key allows you to quit the program. 
<p>
<h3>Printing</h3>
You can print from this disc four ways:
<ul>
<li>individual records
<li>multiple records (or tagged records)
<li>the hitlist
<li>the search query screen.
</ul>
To print an individual record from the hitlist, move the cursor down to that record and then select the &lt;F7&gt; function key.  The computer will print the full  record for that item.
<p>
To select any of the other three options hit the &lt;ALT&gt; key, then the letter &quot;P&quot; to access the print menu.  You will be given the choice of printing all tagged records, the hitlist and the search query screen.  
<p>
To print full records for some or all of the items found in your search, select &quot;print all tagged records&quot; from the print menu.   Please note,  if you only want to print a few of the records, you must mark the records that you don't want to print.  To do this, you must remove the arrow sign which appears along the left-hand side of the screen by pressing the &lt;spacebar&gt;.  
<p>
To print the hitlist in  brief record format select &quot;hitlist&quot; from the print menu. You can also print the search query screen by selecting that option from the print menu. 
  <p>
This product will save a great deal of time when researching. You can now quickly retrieve relevant references from this compact disc and then find them in the library system using UTCat.

<h2><a name = "lexis">LEXIS/NEXIS available in the Computer Lab</a></h2></center>

Lexis/Nexis provides access to case law, summaries, articles and legislation from around the world, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States, and the European Community, plus full-text documents from more than 2,400 sources worldwide including newspapers, magazines, and journals.
<p>
Lexis/Nexis is now available free of charge on 4 computers in the Computer Lab. Macintosh computers #11, 12, 13 and 14 provide free direct access to the Lexis/Nexis databases. Instructions on how to use Lexis/Nexis, including how to download and print cases and articles, have been placed next to the four computers. As well, two copies of the Lexis/Nexis database directory have been placed in the Lab. Students who would like more detailed information can check the Computer Lab Manual. The Library is preparing training sessions on how to use Lexis/Nexis. These sessions will be provided at some point this term if numbers warrant. A sign up sheet for those students who are interested in Lexis/Nexis training has been put up in the lab. If enough students sign up then we will schedule training sessions at a convenient time this term. Keep an eye on LawLink  and Headnotes  for announcements regarding Lexis/Nexis training.
<p>
<h3>Lexis/Nexis Legal Education Program - Passwords at a discounted rate:</h3>
Mead Data International, Inc. has introduced a new Educational Program for Canadian law schools. Students who wish to have their own Lexis/Nexis password can now do so. With their own password students can access Lexis/Nexis from home, if they have a computer and modem, or use one of the other Macs in the Lab and not be restricted to the four designated Lexis machines. <b>Passwords cost only $30.00 for Lexis or $40.00 for Lexis/Nexis access per academic year.</b> Subscription forms are available at the Circulation desk in the Law Library. Under this educational program certain restrictions apply. Students are restricted from using the service from 2 - 4 PM on weekdays; printing is available to an attached printer or to disk but not to the Lexis/Nexis printer; the passwords are only operational during the school term. Copies of the Lexis/Nexis search software are available from Gian Medves (978-5537). Please call for an appointment and bring a 3.5" diskette with you. 
<p>
<h3>Lexis/Nexis Passwords for Faculty:</h3>
The Library has acquired four ports to access Lexis/Nexis for the exclusive use of Faculty members. Faculty interested in accessing Lexis/Nexis should contact Gian Medves (5537) for instructions as well as Lexis/Nexis reference guides.

<h2><a name = "criminal">Criminal Justice on the Internet</h2>
<h3>by Cathy Matthews and Tom Finlay<br>
Centre of Criminology Library</h3></center>
This article will introduce you to some of the basic sources of criminal law and criminal justice on the Internet. It is divided into two parts: mailing lists (or discussion groups), and gopher sites.
<p>
<h3>Mailing Lists</h3>
There are several lively discussion groups addressing criminal justice interests on the net.  A subscription to a discussion group is a means of sharing ideas or consulting with colleagues teaching or conducting research in your area.  To subscribe send an e-mail message to the appropriate listserv address, as in the &quot;subscribe&quot; line in each example shown below.  Then send the simple subscribe name-of-list your name message.  Remember to save any &quot;opening correspondence&quot; you receive which documents how to unsubscribe, how to retrieve archived postings, and other general rules of the list.  Once you have signed on to a discussion list use the mail address not the listserv address to send messages to the list.
<p>
The three lists monitored most actively at the Centre of Criminology are:
<p>
<h3>LAWSOC-L (The Canadian Law and Society Discussion List):</h3>
This list, coordinated by Prof. Russell Smandych at the University of Manitoba, focuses on interdisciplinary issues relevant to the study of Law and Society in the Canadian context, including law, sociology, economics, psychology, criminology, feminist studies, etc., and to others working in areas of government policy, law reform or the delivery of legal services.

 <p>
<h3>UNCJIN-L (The United Nations Criminal Justice Information Network List):</h3>
This list, started by Prof. Graeme Newman of SUNY-Albany, and with funding from the U.S. Justice Department, is a large, international list which defines criminology and criminal justice very broadly.  Recent topics included requests for advice on re-writing the juvenile justice laws in South Africa, discussion of minimum age for capital punishment, and the costs of sentencing and incarceration.  In addition, the list often posts job notices, journal tables-of-contents, and occasional book reviews.

<p>
<h3>CJUST-L (Criminal Justice List): </h3>
This is a smaller forum than UNCJIN-L, but it is growing rapidly and now has over 400 members.  Recent discussions concerned topics as diverse as whether justice was served by Jeffery Dahmer's murder and fetal alcohol syndrome and the law.

<p>
A more complete list can be found in Guide to Internet Resources in Criminal Law and Criminal Justice  prepared by the International Centre for Criminal Law Reform and Criminal Justice Policy. This list is expected to be available on the University of British Columbia Gopher shortly (gopher.ubc.ca) or via World Wide Web (http//view.ubc.ca).
<p>
<h3>Gopher Sites</h3>
Previous articles in this newsletter (see LawLink, Volume 1, Number 1) have explained the importance of the Cornell Legal Information Institute (gopher: fatty.law.cornell.edu) for a host of legal information and resources.  We would like to direct you to a few sites which have particular strengths in the area of criminal law and criminal justice.
<p>
The most frequently used at the Centre of Criminology is the UNCJIN gopher (United Nations Criminal Justice Information Network, as in the discussion list noted above).  This well-organized site contains full text documents (such as U.N. Rules and other instruments, newsletters of U.N. agencies), connections to other gophers, listings and text of Bureau of Justice Statistics documents, the World Directory of Criminological Institutes, access via telnet to the World Criminal Justice Library Network, U.S. Supreme Court Decisions, the CIA World Factbook, primary documents in foreign and international law, the full text of the U.S. Crime Bill, and many other valuable resources. To access this source:
gopher to: uacsc2.albany.edu
<p>
An interesting Canadian legal information site is the International Centre for Criminal Law Reform and Criminal Justice Policy at the University of British Columbia.  It is a recently-initiated gopher site, and a joint initiative of UBC, Simon Fraser and the Society for the Reform of the Criminal Law.  They describe their focus as: 
<ul>	
<li>International criminal law and procedure reform.
<li>International human rights and administration of criminal justice.
<li>Criminal justice research and policy development.
<li>Education, communication and the provision of information in criminal law and justice.<br> 
Source (Guide to Internet Resources in Criminal Law and Criminal Justice)
</ul>
To access the International Centre for Criminal Law Reform and Criminal Justice Policy gopher, gopher to: view.ubc.ca or by World Wide Web (http://view.ubc.ca). Then select "Academic units and information".
<p>
There are other sources which have been helpful to us at the Centre of Criminology.  Their gopher addresses follow:
<p>
Canada Supreme Court Decisions: gopher to gopher.droit.umontreal.ca
<p>
Federal Government (including Statistics Canada): gopher to: debra.dgbt.doc.ca
<p>
NCJRS (National Criminal Justice Reference Service) : gopher to: NCJRS.aspensys.com
<p>
The NCJRS gopher is a new site that is quickly developing into an important source of information.  This site puts one in touch with many information professionals in the U.S. justice system.  It also facilitates the ordering of publications from many departments such as the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the National Institute of Justice.  It has just made the latest edition (#228) of the NIJ Journal  available.
<p>
Please call us at 978-7068 if we may provide you with further assistance, or e-mail us at Matthewsc@vax.library.utoronto.ca or Finlay@vax.library.utoronto.ca.  This information is up-to-date at the time of writing, but information can be changed at gopher sites regularly, and items cited may be dropped and/or new sources added over time. 
<p>
<center><img src = "../icons/grkban09.gif"></center><p>
<center><h2><a name = "netscape">Netscape: Navigating the Internet from the Computer Lab</a></h2></center>
A new Internet browser called Netscape has been loaded on all of the Macintosh computers in the Lab except no's 6, 12 and 13. Netscape makes navigating the Internet relatively easy. Netscape has graphics capabilities that allow you to &quot;see&quot; the Internet.
<p>
Using Netscape you're going to bring pages of the Internet to your computer screen. The Internet is a collection of information stored in computers physically located throughout the world. Much of the information on the Internet is organized onto pages. You'll bring one page to your computer screen, discover its contents, and have the option of bringing more pages of information.
<p>
Some of these pages are richly formatted and colorfully illustrated, capable of bringing you sounds and movies and interactivity. To get to the information you seek, you'll need connections to these pages. Well-crafted pages provide built-in connections to other pages. That is, clicking your mouse button on a highlighted word or picture brings another page of information - a linked page - to your screen. The entire network of pages can be interlinked, one pointing to another. As a result, you can bring information in the meaningful context of &quot;Here is some information on a page in front of me, and highlighted on this page is a connection to related information I might wish to explore next.&quot;
<p>
First and foremost, Netscape software presents pages of the Internet with elegance and efficiency. Netscape software is a browseran interfaceto pages throughout the world. Netscape software allows you to immerse yourself in information unencumbered by the complexity of distributed networks.
<p>
Students and faculty are invited to try Netscape to explore the myriad of legal resources available on the Internet. If you need more information on how to use Netscape beyond running the program and pointing and clicking, check the Computer Lab Manual for detailed instructions.

<P>
Regular library hours will resume on Monday January 2nd, 8:45
am - Midnight.
<P>
<b>Please note: Because of a planned system upgrade, all services
offered through UTLink, including the online catalog, will not
be available during the break.  Please plan your research schedule
accordingly.</b>
<P>
<h3>Computer Lab and Group Study Room Use</h3>
<P>
Because of problems brought to our attention by law students concerning
the use of group study rooms and the computer lab, all students
will be asked to show their student card when they book  a computer
or a group study room. Although this may seem a little inconvenient,
it is for your benefit as we are making a sincere attempt to keep
the group study rooms and the computer lab restricted to law students
only. We ask your co-operation in making sure that the group study
rooms are locked when you leave them and that you do not let students
without the door code into the computer lab.  Please report any
problems to the Circulation Desk.
<P>
In order to ensure that library users are aware of this policy,
the following notice will be placed on the doors of the group
study and moot court rooms:
<blockquote>
This Room may only be used by University of Toronto Faculty of
Law students for the purpose of group study (i.e. two or more
law students working together).
</blockquote><p>
<h3>Common Room Key</h3>
<P>
The key to the common room is now being kept at the Circulation
Desk for after-hours use. You must sign for the key and must leave
a piece of identification at the Circulation Desk while the key
is in your possession. You are responsible for the key and the
use of the common room while you have the key signed out. Please
note, the Library is providing this service as a courtesy to the
SLS and neither the Library nor its staff are responsible for
the common room or its machines in any way.
<P>
<h3>Security Devices</h3>
<P>
The Faculty's Security Committee has purchased six personal
safety alarms for student use in Faculty buildings. These alarms
may be borrowed from the Circulation Desk. You must leave a piece
of identification when you borrow the alarm. The alarms must be
returned to the desk before you leave the buildings. You should
be aware that use of these alarms does not guarantee a response;
their principal purpose is to scare off an attacker. Please read
the instructions which come with the alarms.

<center><h2><a name = "three">Introducing Three New Automated Services to Library Users</a></h2></center>
<P>
The University of Toronto Library system has recently introduced
three new timesaving services.
<P>
<h3>Self Charge at the Robarts and Sigmund Samuel Libraries</h3>
<P>
To avoid the line-ups when you are in the Robarts or Sigmund Samuel
Libraries, you may self-charge barcoded books. There are four
self-charge units in the Robarts Library and one in the Sigmund
Samuel/Science &amp; Medicine Library complex. You must have a
barcoded library card with you in order to take advantage of this
system. 
<P>
<h3>Touch Tone Renewal by Telephone</h3>
<P>
You may now renew your loans and get information about your overdue
books, fines and holds by dialing 971-2400 from a touch-tone telephone.
You must have your library card barcode and the book barcode ready
when you dial in. After you are connected, you will be given four
options:
<ul>
<li>Press 1 for renewals.
<li>Press 2 for overdues.
<li>Press 3 for fines.
<li>Press 4 for holds.
</ul>
<h3>See What You Have Signed Out on the UTLink System</h3>
<P>
You can see a list of the items you have signed out by selecting
#12 (See what you have signed out) from the UTLink front-end menu
or by selecting 'Check your loans' under 'UTLink
Options...' in the UTCat (online catalogue) system.
<P>
<center><img src="../icons/grkban09.gif"></center><p>
<center><h2><a name = "dial">Dial in Access to UTLink</a></h2></center>
<P>
Library users with computers and modems can dial in to UTlink
from home. Law  students can also Telnet to UTLink from the computer
lab. The following are brief instructions on how to dial in either
through a modem or via Telnet.
<P>

<center><h2><a name = "freenet">The Toronto Free-Net</a></h2>
<h3>By Gian Medves<br>
 Computer Services Librarian</h3></center>
<P>
The Toronto Free-Net is up and running and accepting memberships.
 Free-Nets started as grassroots efforts to provide networking
services to  local communities, with access either at public libraries
or by dialing in. They are a means by which individuals, who would
not normally have direct (and inexpensive) access to the Internet
can now have some limited access to the Information Highway.
<P>
Free-Nets are usually organized around a model town that you &quot;walk&quot;
through. You can stop at the post office and collect your mail,
wander through the arts and entertainment district and plan your
night out or head to the Government building to argue with a bureaucrat.
Aside from discussions and mail, there are bulletin boards, special
interest group forums and news services.
<P>
The Toronto Free-Net offers access to a number of Internet tools
like gopher, World Wide Web and Telnet that are not available
right now through U of T's UTORmail. Law students can access
the Toronto Free-Net from the Computer Lab or from home if they
have a computer, modem and communications software.
<P>
<h3>To access the Free-Net from the Computer Lab</h3>
<blockquote>
 1)Select NCSA Telnet from the Macintosh main menu.
<p>
 2)Select Open Connection under the File pull-down menu.
<p>
 3)When prompted for Session Name, type freenet  and you
will be connected to the Toronto Free-Net. 
</blockquote>
<h3>To access the Free-Net from home</h3>
<blockquote>
 1)Make sure your modem settings are set to 8 data
bits, 1 stop bit, and no parity. The dial-in lines
currently support speeds up to 14,400 bps.
<P>
 2)Dial 780-2010.
</blockquote>
If you have any questions concerning the Free-Net, the voice number
is (905) 568-9944.
<P>
The first time you login to the Free-Net you will sign-on as guest.
This provides you with limited privileges on the system. Once
you register you will be allowed full access to the system which
includes e-mail, UseNet news, WWW, gopher and Telnet capabilities.
Although registration is free, a donation is requested. To register,
select the following menus from the main menu: 
<P>
 <i>Administration Building...
<br>
  Online Registration Program...</i>
<P>
Once you have registered, an account will be created for you.
Next, you must complete and mail the &quot;Toronto Free-Net
Member Agreement&quot;. This form may be downloaded to your
computer and printed out or you can pick up a form at the Circulation
Desk. Allow 4-6 weeks for your application to be processed.

<h3>Gian Medves, Computer Services Librarian</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Applying for a UTORmail account and password</b>
<p>
As of September 6, 1994 law students, faculty and staff became eligible for free UTORmail, the University of Toronto's institutional e-mail service. During the summer we were told that only graduate law students would have access to UTORmail. In mid-September we were informed that undergraduate law students were now considered graduate students and were also entitled to have free access to UTORmail.
<p>
As the situation now stands all  law students can apply for a UTORmail account and password. To apply for an account and password go to the Circulation Desk in the Law Library and ask for a UTORmail application form. You must then call 978-0444 to make an appointment. When you make your appointment, ask where you have to go because the address has changed three times since the registration process was begun in early September. Take your completed application form along with you to the appointment. If you would like to access UTORmail from home you will need a minimum 9600 baud modem. If you so desire, appropriate software will be provided to you at your appointment. If you intend to use UTORmail from the Computer Lab you will not require software. An e-mail software package (called Eudora) will be available on the Mac workstations in the Lab.
<p>
<b>Please Note:</b>  When we received the Eudora software to access UTORmail from the Computer Lab, we experienced problems connecting to the mail server. That problem has just been resolved. We will get Eudora running on 2 Macs as quickly as possible and add it to the others as time permits.
<p>
<b>Getting started with e-mail</b>
<p>
With UTORmail users can compose electronic messages at their workstations then download them to the University's central mail server (a computer that stores and distributes mail) or they can retrieve messages from the mail server and read them at their workstations. Most of the work is done at a local workstation. The mail server then simply distributes that mail. The mail server determines the best route to reach a recipient and passes the e-mail to the next closest mail server. The e-mail can be passed through any number of mail servers before it reaches its final destination. This whole process usually takes from a few seconds to a few minutes. UTORmail users can:
<ul>
<li> Send text-based messages to any other user on the Internet.
<li> Attach computer files to text-based messages.
<li> Send messages and files to multiple recipients.
<li> Reply to and forward messages that they receive.
<li> Subscribe to electronic mailing lists/listservs (see last issue for more details).
<li> Search archives of various listservs to follow world-wide (conversations) or threads on a particular topic.
</ul>
<b>Using Eudora</b>
<p>
At present the only e-mail program that is supported in the Law Library's Computer Lab is a package called Eudora. Another package, ECS Mail, may also be available in the future. Eudora must be properly configured before you can begin using it to send and receive e-mail. Detailed instructions are provided in the Computer Lab Manual.
<ol>
<li> Launch Eudora by clicking on the Eudora option from the Macintosh main menu.
<li> Select the configuration command from the Special menu.
<li> Enter your user name in the POP account field in the format:<br>
    firstname.lastname@mailboxX.utcc.utoronto.ca <br>(where X equals the configuration  number that you were assigned when you received your UTORmail account).
<li> Enter your real name in the Real Name box.
<li> Enter the name of your mail server in the SMTP Server box using the format:<br>
	     postofficeX.utcc.utoronto.ca <br>(where X equals your configuration number).
<li> Enter your e-mail address in the Return Address box.
<li> Enter phX.utcc.utoronto.ca in the Ph Server box (again  X = your config. number).
<li> Click the OK button. You have completed the basic configuration process; (it looks more complicated than it is).
</ol>
You can now begin to compose and send messages using Eudora. To create an e-mail message go to the Message menu and select the New Message command. Enter  the e-mail address of the recipient in the To: field then press the Tab key. Enter a short subject in the Subject: field then press the Tab key again. You have the option of sending courtesy copies in the Cc: field by entering the e-mail address of other message recipients in this field or you can tab directly to the message field and either type or paste text directly into this field. Once you have completed your message click the Queue button. Your message will be stored on the hard drive of your Macintosh and will be sent to the mail server when you select the Send Queued Messages command from the File menu.
<p>
To receive and read e-mail with Eudora select the Check Mail command from the File menu. The password dialog box will appear. Enter your e-mail password and click the OK button. If you have e-mail waiting it will be downloaded and a list of your messages will be displayed on the screen with the following information: name of the sender, time message was sent and the subject of the message. Double click on the subject line of the message you want to read and the full message will be displayed. To close the message window click on the close box.
<p>
<b>Security considerations</b>
<p>
Make sure that you delete your messages once you have read or replied to them. If you would like to keep your messages, save them to a floppy disk and take them away with you. If you leave them on the hard drive of the Macintosh others will be able to read your messages.
<p>	
<b>UTORmail vs GPU</b>
<p>
At this time UTORmail is simply an e-mail service. You can send electronic mail  to other users on the Internet but you do not have access to such Internet utilities as Archie, gopher, telnet and ftp. If students want to have full Internet access, they should consider getting a GPU account or subscribe to the Toronto FreeNet once that system becomes operational. Unlike UTORmail, GPU is not free. You will be asked for a deposit and will be charged for connect time and storage. Those students interested in a GPU account or information on the Toronto FreeNet can call me (Gian Medves) at 978-5537.
<p>
<center><h2><a name = "annelegge">Introducing  Anne Legge</a></h2></center>

As of May 1, 1994 Anne Legge joined Computer Services Librarian, Gian Medves, as his assistant.  Formerly a member of the Cataloguing Department, Anne is now responsible for: performing regular and preventive maintenance on computers in the lab; assisting students with technical problems; and changing computer passwords and door codes to ensure security.  Anne is available in the Library on Mondays and Tuesdays from 8:30 - 4:30.
<p><center><img src="../icons/grkban09.gif"></center><p>
<center><h2><a name = "statute">CANADA STATUTE SERVICE ON CD-ROM</a></h2>
<h3>Esther Wan, Reference Librarian</h3></center>

Finally, the day has arrived when Canadian federal statutes have all been encapsulated on a single disk. Although this does not mean that you will never have to look at the print version again, looking up statutes has suddenly become much easier; (I hear a big hurrah I am sure from most law students).
<p>
<cite>Canada Statute Service</cite> on CD-ROM consists of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985 in full text and all Public General Acts subsequently enacted until March 31, 1994 (with the exception of the Income Tax Act, which was excluded). This new cd product also contains the <cite>Canada Statute Citator</cite>, which provides both history and case information for all statutes except for the Criminal Code and the Constitution Act, which includes the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. These short case annotations provide citation information and a brief headnote for each case. As well, they are linked to longer case summaries available from the <cite>All-Canada Weekly Summaries</cite> (A.C.W.S.) and the <cite>Weekly Criminal Bulletin</cite> (W.C.B.) from December 31, 1988 to March 25, 1994. the CD-ROM will be updated four times a year, thus you will need only to consult the current session bills in order to complete your research (amazing, isn't it?).
<p>
Though the welcome screen looks a little daunting, searching this product is relatively simple. Once you have &quot;double-clicked&quot; on the gray bar entitled, &quot;The Canada Statute Service&quot;, you have two choices: to search the statutes themselves or the Canada Statute Citator. Regardless of your choice, you then have two means of searching this product. If you know the name of the state that you are looking for, consult the Table of Contents. this alphabetical list of the federal statutes cleverly embeds a wealth of information for each state. You are also able jump to any references mentioned within the text of any statue. Do not despair if the name of the Act eludes you, this cd also allows you to search by keyword using boolean operators (&quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot;). As you type in the keywords, the system will display the number of records that may be retrieved. Expert searchers may opt to use field searches to refine their queries. 
<p>
Since this is only a demo disk, the Library has 30 days to decide whether or not to purchase it (we have it until early November). Please take a moment to try it out and let us know what you think.

<P>
 The first issue of LawLink was well received by its readers.
Now, with the school year beginning, it's time to introduce the
newsletter to law students. Copies of issue #1 will be available
at the Reference Desk. Please pick one up; among other things,
it contains an informative article by Gian Medves entitled <i>Legal
Reference Sources on the Internet</i>.
<P>
 In this second issue, we continue with more information about
the Internet by focusing on discussion lists that are relevant
for the legal researcher. You will also find notices about new
CD-ROM titles,  signing on to QL's online databases and introduction
to U of T's new e-mail system.
<P>
<cite>LawLink</cite> itself may soon go electronic. We are investigating the
possibility of making the newsletter available on the Robarts
Library's gopher. This would, of course, make it accessible to
a much wider audience, namely, anyone who can dial into UTLINK.
For the coming year, however, even if the newsletter is on the
gopher, the Library will continue to make print copies available

<center><h2><a name = "discussion">Discussion Lists on the Internet</a></h2>
by Gian Medves<br>
Computer Services Librarian</center>
<P>
<i>As promised in the first issue of <cite>LawLink</cite>, this article provides
information about the various law related discussion lists that
are available on the Internet through e-mail.</i>
<P>
 Keeping up with the Internet is difficult at the best of times,
if not outright impossible.  This is because the Internet is vast,
diverse and continually changing. Therefore, it is necessary that
you utilize whatever expertise is available; e-mail and electronic
discussion lists provide just such a forum.
<P>
 Electronic mail is perhaps the most popular application on the
Internet because it extends and enhances our ability to communicate
with others.  One of the best ways to keep abreast of new developments
in networked legal information resources and to learn how to navigate
through the Internet is to cultivate network contacts through e-mail.
 Others on the network who know of your interests can inform you
of what resources are available and how to get to them.  An electronic
discussion list (or mailing list) utilizes the power of e-mail
to put you in touch with a large number of people with similar
interests who have come together to discuss a particular topic.
 These people usually have similar backgrounds and interests and
a desire to share ideas, opinions, problems and solutions.
<P>
Electronic discussion lists can be &quot;moderated&quot; or &quot;unmoderated&quot;.
 On a moderated discussion list, messages are screened and perhaps
combined with similar messages by a list administrator before
being sent to subscribers.  On an unmoderated list all messages
are automatically forwarded to everyone on the list.  Most electronic
discussions are supported by a software program called a listserv
that automates functions related to setting up, moderating and
interacting with those lists.  The listserv allows users to subscribe
or unsubscribe to electronic discussions, as well as find out
who else subscribes to a particular list and search past messages
of archived discussions.
<P>
To subscribe to a discussion list simply send an e-mail message
to the subscription address of the listserv hosting the discussion
list. Your message should read, <b>subscribe list name your name</b>
where <b>list name</b> is the name of the discussion list and <b>your name</b>
is your full name. For example, to sign on to the Artificial Intelligence
and Law list:
<ol>
<li>Send an e-mail message to:<br>
     listserv@austin.onu.edu
<P>
<li>As your message say:<br>
   subscribe ail-l john doe
</ol>
 Once you are a member of a list, to send messages for distribution,
use the mail,  not the subscription, address.

<center><h2><a name = "library">Library Announcements</a></h2>
<P>
<h3>First Year Students: Legal Research Lectures</h3></center>
<P>
 Ann Morrison, Associate Librarian, will deliver a lecture on
Canadian legal research on Monday, September 19 (and repeated
on Wednesday, September 21) in the Bennett Hall  at 12:00 p.m.
sharp. This lectures will be instrumental in assisting you with
your  library assignments.  Upper year students who would like
to refresh their research skills are also invited to attend.
<P>
<center><h3>QuickLaw (QL) Passwords for Law Students</h3></center>
<P>
QuickLaw has re-activated all educational passwords for 1994-95.
All upper year and graduate students who already have a QL password
should have had access to QL as of September 6, 1994. If you experience
any problems, please call QL at (416) 862-7656.
<P>
QL's computer-based sign-up program will be available to all
first year and new graduate students by the end of September.
First year students will receive their passwords during their
QL training sessions prior to library assignment  #3.   The dates
and times of these sessions will be posted in the Library shortly.

<p><center><img src = "../icons/grkban09.gif"></center><p>
<center><h2><a name = "mail">Institutional Electronic Mail Service</a></h2></center>
<P>
 On September 13, University of Toronto's Computing and Communications
will be launching the U of T institutional e-mail service called
UTORmail. The service is free to faculty, staff, and graduate
students. There are plans to make UTORmail available to undergraduate
students at some point in the future.
<P>
 Each person who wants a UTORmail &quot;mailbox&quot; must complete
a &quot;Request for UTORmail Service&quot; form. These forms can be
obtained from Kathy Tam (faculty and law school staff) and Gian
Medves (graduate students and law library staff). On this form
you will be asked for personal information (name, address, department,
personnel number/(graduate) student number and the password you
want to use. You will also be asked whether you will be accessing
the e-mail service from a PC/Windows, Macintosh or DOS workstation.
UTCC will provide electronic mail software for your system: Pegasus
for PC/Windows, Eudora for Macintosh, and PINE for DOS. A mailbox
and a password will be issued upon evidence of eligibility, e.g.
a U of T personnel number for faculty and staff, or a U of T student
number for graduate students. 
<P>
 The minimum hardware and software requirements for accessing
UTORnet are:
<dl>
<dt>PC<dd>386 PC or compatible
<dd>4 megabytes of RAM
<dd>10 megabytes of available hard disk space
<dd>Extended keyboard, mouse, VGA colour monitor
<dd>DOS 5.0 or greater; or Windows 3.1
<P>
<dt>Macintosh <dd>68000 based processor
<dd>4 megabytes of RAM
<dd>5 megabytes of available hard disk space
<dd>Keyboard, mouse and monitor
<dd>Macintosh O/S (version 6.0.7 or greater)
</dl>
 Dial-in service will be available so that users can get their
mail both at the university and from home. Dial-in service is
available only at 9600 or 14,400 bps. UTCC recommends the external
Supra Faxmodem 144LC but any modem that supports the V.32bis standard
should work.
<P>
Graduate students can use the Macintosh computers in the Computer
Lab to access UTORmail. E-mail training sessions will be provided
at some point in the near future. The dates and times of these
sessions will be posted in the Library as well as in the next
issue of <cite>LawLink</cite>. Graduate students requiring more information
can contact Gian Medves at x5537.

<p><center><img src = "../icons/grkban09.gif"></center><p>
<center><h2><a name = "rules">Rules of the Computer Lab</a></h2></center>
<P>
<b>In exchange for access to the computer lab,  law students agree
to comply with the rules and regulations set forth below, and
understand that if found not complying, they will be dismissed
from the lab for the whole term.</b>
<ol>
<li>This Computer Lab is for the sole use of law students. In
order to maintain security and prevent unauthorized use, a combination lock system has
been installed on the Computer Lab door. The combination will be changed periodically.
In order to get  the combination you will have to go to the circulation desk
and sign for it. You will be asked to provide valid ID (student card or library card).
<P>
<li>When in the lab, do not let students in. They must sign for
the combination on their own.
<P>
<li>When in the lab, do not prop the door open as this defeats
the whole purpose of having a secured room.
<P>
<li>If you see anyone who is not a law student using the facility
please report it to the circulation desk.
<P>
<li>Please keep the room as clean and tidy as possible and keep
the noise level down.
<P>
<li>Food and  drinks are not allowed in the Computer Lab.
<P>
<li>Students and faculty are not allowed to:
<ul>
   a) Tamper with systems and/or configurations of computers,
or rearrange desktops.<br>
   b) Make copies or install software on computers.
</ul>
<li>Student files left on the hard drives will be trashed. Make
sure you save your work onto floppy diskettes. This is for your protection as well as
keeping the machines from getting cluttered. A file left on a hard drive can be copied
by someone else.
<P>
<li>The Computer Lab will be reserved at times for classes in
online information retrieval. At these times the lab is reserved for students taking the class.
Computers and printers are not available to any other students at these times. <b>Don't
even ask!</b>
<P>
<li>Printing protocol:
<ul>
<li>Do not print until you have inserted your copy card into
the reader<br>
<li>If you wish to cancel your print job, terminate it from your
workstation; do not simply remove your copy card.
</ul>
</ol>
The Computer Lab is your  facility. Please take care of it. By
following the protocol outlined above we hope to prevent theft
and vandalism and reduce the danger of having viruses invade the
system.

<h2>Introducing...</h2>
<cite>Lawlink</cite> is a new venture for the Library staff, and one we hope
you will welcome. It's not that we think you need more to read.
We simply think you nee to read this newsletter.
<P>
Information sources are changing so rapidly that we wanted a way
of keeping you better informed. <cite>Headnotes</cite> just didn't seem to be
the right vehicle, so <cite>LawLink</cite> was born. We hope to bring it to
you 10 times a year under the able editorship of Susan Barker
and with contributions from all units of the Library. Content
is intended to be short and to the point with the occasional longer
article such as the one we begin with from Gian Medves on Legal
Reference Resources on the Internet. In future issues we will
bring you information on notable new books, electronic sources
of information, how to get an e-mail account, how to get passwords
for various databases and how to start exploring the Internet.
We'll also use the newsletter to ask your opinion on various matters
and to make announcements.
<P>
If you have information of this type that is worth sharing with
colleagues, we hope you will consider contributing it to Susan
so we can include it in <cite>LawLink</cite>. We will always be open to your
suggestions for making the newsletter as useful as possible to
you. If you want us address specific issues, please tell us.

<center><h2><a name = "sources">Legal Reference Sources on the Internet</a></h2>
<h3>by Gian Medves<br>
Computer Services Librarian</h3></center>
<P>
<i>This article is intended to introduce some basic Internet concepts
and provide specific examples of useful sources of information.
there is a list of texts to help novice users navigate the information
highway at the end of the article. In addition, a hands-on session
of Internet training with Gian or Esther can help you get started.</i>
<P>
The Internet is a worldwide collection of networks in which regional
networks are connected into one great &quot;living thing&quot;
communicating at amazing speeds. The Internet gives you the ability
to access:
<ul>
<li>specialized databases
<li>electronic discussion lists
<li>electronic books and journals
<li>computer programs, and
<li>a variety of experts and specialists via electronic mail (e-mail).
</ul>
You can gain access to all kinds of information from your computer
at work or at home: all that is required is a modem, a phone line
and some training.
<P>
<h3>Internet Access Methods</h3>
<P>
There are four main methods of gaining access to the Internet,
these are: Gopher, Telnet, FTP and Electronic-mail.
<P>
Gopher is the easiest way to find information. The Gopher utility
enables you to have rapid access to a remote computer located
anywhere on the Internet. Gopher is menu-driven and provides full-text
searching capabilities to identify desired documents. where available,
legal resources are listed in tidy menus; however, it is not uncommon
for some gopher menus to be several layers deep. thus, finding
some information may necessitate a great deal of browsing. Once
you have signed onto the University of Toronto's computer network,
you can use the gopher command to connect to the remote location
of your choice. For example:
<dl>
<dd><i>gopher droit.umontreal.ca port 70</i>
</dl>
will connect you to the Gopher server at the Universite de Montreal
which contains the full text of recent supreme Court decisions.
<P>
Telnet is software that allows users to log in to remote computers
on the Internet. Once connected, you can browse databases, run
software, read files or retrieve documents. From the Internet
you can use the Telnet command to log in to a remote host. For
example:
<dl>
<dd><i>telnet wugate.wustl.edu</i>
</dl>
will connect you to a telnet site at Washington University which
contains information about U.S., European and government library
systems as well as weather reports for the U.S. and Canada.
<P>
FTP (file transfer protocol) is the primary method for transferring
files over the Internet. With this program it is possible to copy
a file (at extremely high speeds) from a computer anywhere in
the world. This normally requires that you have a user id on both
the sending and receiving machines. However, one way around this
restriction is via &quot;anonymous ftp&quot;. Some computer administrators
have set aside areas on their machines that can be accessed without
an account (i.e. anonymously) for the purpose of distributing
documents, software and other files. Use the command ftp to begin
you file transfer session.
<P>
Electronic mail or e-mail can be a very powerful tool for the
legal researcher. Not only can you communicate with colleagues
directly, but by subscribing to an electronic discussion list
you communicate with a variety of experts from around the world
and thereby tap into invaluable information resources.
<P>
<h3>Discussion Lists (Listservs)</h3>
<P>
One of the best ways to keep abreast of new developments in networked
legal information resources and to learn how to navigate through
the Internet is to cultivate network contacts through e-mail.
an electronic discussion list utilizes the power of e-mail to
put you in touch with a large number of people with similar interests
who have come together to discuss a particular topic. Electronic
discussions can be &quot;moderated&quot; or &quot;unmoderated&quot;.
On a moderated discussion list, messages are screened and perhaps
combined with similar messages by a list administrator before
being sent to subscribers. On an unmoderated list, all messages
are automatically forwarded to everyone on the list. Most electronic
discussions are supported by a software program called a &quot;listserv&quot;
that automates functions related to setting up, moderating and
interacting with those lists. the listserv allows you to subscribe
or unsubscribe to electronic discussion lists and to search for
past messages in archived discussions.
<P>
To subscribe to a discussion list simply send an e-mail message
to the subscription address of the listserv hosting the discussion
list. Include in the body of your message the link subscribe [list
name] your name, for example:
<dl>
<dd><i>Subscribe H-LAW Joe Smith</i>
</dl>
adds Joe Smith to the Health Law discussion list.
<P>
For a comprehensive list of law-related discussion lists, please
see the next issue of LawLink available September 15, 1994.
<P>
<h3>The Internet on UTLINK</h3>
<P>
One extremely valuable research tool is the Information Gateway
in the Library's on-line catalogue (UTLink). Through UTLink, you
can access university library catalogues in: The Americas, i.e.
Canada, the United States and Mexico: Europe/Scandinavia and Asia/Pacific/South
Africa. You can search these catalogues by selecting &quot;Other
Libraries&quot; from the UTLink Menu in the Information Gateway.
Once you have selected the library catalogue that you wish to
search, you can sign on by following the on-screen instructions.
the &quot;Internet Resources&quot; option in the UTLink menu will
provide you with access to a wide variety of resources including:
publications on-line, gopher sites, bulletin boards and many other
resources.
<P>
<h3>Canadian Online Legal Resources</h3>
<P>
One source of Canadian legal information is a relatively new gopher
that has been set up at the Facult&eacute; de Droit - Universit&eacute; de Montr&eacute;al.
Though this Gopher you can access: both the French and English
versions of the new Quebec Civil Code, recent Supreme Court judgments
and CUB (unemployment insurance) decisions. You can access this
Gopher either through e-mail at:
<dl>
<dd><i>verona.droit.umontreal.ca</i>
<dd>or by
<dd><i>gopher droit.umontreal.ca port 70</i>
</dl>
The Washington and Lee gopher site has a very large collection
of legal resources including some Canadian materials: the Canadian
Legal Research Files (from Queen's University) and texts of the
Charlettetown Accord, Meech Lake Accord, the Canadian Constitution
Act and the North American Free Trade Agreement. To get there:
<dl>
<dd><i>telnet liberty.uc.wlu.edu</i>
<dd>Login: <i>lawlib</i>
</dl>
<h3>U.S. Online Legal Resources</h3>
<P>
The major American law-related gopher sites include those at Cornell
Law School, Washington and Lee University (Liberty), Washburn
(Washlaw), and the Library of Congress (LC-MARVEL).
<P>
Through its Legal Information Institute, the Cornell Law School
provides access to a wide range of legal materials including the
U.S. Constitution, recent Supreme court decisions, various federal
Acts, and certain articles of the Uniform commercial Code. To
access the Legal Information Institute:
<dl>
<dd><i>telnet fatty.law.cornell.edu 8200</i>
<dd>Login: <i>www or gopher</i>
</dl>
At Washington and Lee some of the information available in the
&quot;legal sources&quot; path (#8) includes the Directory of
Legal Academia, Electronic Jurisprudence BBS, Court Bulletin Boards,
and the United States Federal Register. To access:
<dl>
<dd>telnet liberty.uc.wlu.edu
<dd>Login: law.lib
</dl>
From its initial menu, the Washlaw gopher at Washburn provides
access to such items as the &quot;virtual&quot; law reference
disk, primary U.S. law and federal government information. To
access:
<dl>
<dd>telnet acc.wuacc.edu
<dd>Login: washlaw
</dl>
The Library of Congress Machine-Assisted Realization of the Virtual
electronic Library (LC-MARVEL) provides access to federal information
resources. This includes: access to information relating to the
executive branch, including the White House; access to information
relating to the legislative branch such as Congressional directories;
and access to information relating to the judiciary, including
supreme Court decisions, orders, and biographies of the sitting

<h3>International Online Legal Resources</h3>
<P>
A valuable tool for researching international legal issues is
the INT-LAW discussion list. The list promotes an exchange of
information related to foreign, comparative and international
legal materials and issues. It has several regular features. These
include the posting of advance tables of contents for <cite>International
Legal Materials</cite> and <cite>The American Journal of International Law</cite>
and news of key foreign and international legal publications both
in print and electronic format.

Another source of foreign and international legal sources is the
gopher at <b>wiretap.spies.com</b>. The wiretap gopher provides access
to a range of foreign legal documents such as the full-text of
some Australian legislations; the United Nations charter and selected
resolutions; the NATO handbook and press releases; and access
to a range of treaties and international covenants in full-text
format including the Maastricht Treaty on European Union, the
Geneva Conventions, and the Hague Conventions. The wiretap gopher
also provides access to various world constitutions and a range
of world documents in full-text format. To access this gopher,
take the following steps:
<dl>
<dd><i>gopher wiretap.spies.com</i>
<dd>then choose
<dd>5. Government Docs (U.S. &amp; World)
<dd>34. World Constitutions
<dd>or

<h3>Additional Resources</h3>
<P>
The largest problem you may face when you first sigh on to the
Internet is finding all that is available. the situation is further
complicated by the fact the new sources are added every day. Although
there is no map to the Internet there are navigational tools and
devices, including printed finding aids and computer programs.
<P>
<h3>Print Resources</h3>

<center><h2><a name = "cdrom">New CD-ROM Network</a></h2></center>
<P>
The Library has recently expanded its number of CD-ROM workstations
from 1 to 6, and the general response can be described as wild
enthusiasm by researchers. With a simple click of the mouse or
of the arrow keys, you may select any of the compact disk products
currently on subscription.
<P>
Legaltrac, the cd version of the <cite>Current Law Index</cite>, contains citations
to and selective abstracts of journal articles from 1980 to the
present (usually up to the last month). Legaltrac can be searched
by author, subject, or keyword and is very user-friendly; you
don't need an instruction book to figure out how to use it! Also
available are the CRTC Broadcasting Decisions and Public Policy
Notices from 1984 to the present (usually 3-4 months behind) in
both English and French. Finally, the 1990 British Columbia Consolidated
Statutes, including the annual statues since 1992, and current
rules of court can also be searched on the network. From time
to time, test products will also be available on the network for
a trial period, and we may come calling for you opinions on these
items. All of the materials on the cd's can be printed using a
copycard. We will be informing you of new developments and CD-ROM
subscriptions in future issues of <cite>LawLink</cite>.

<center><h2><a name = "card">Days Are Numbered for the Card Catalogue</a></h2></center>
<P>
No, we are not thinking of destroying the cards. We <b>are</b> considering
moving the catalogues down to the unfinished space before the
new term starts so that we can use the space along the wall for
other purposes. The cards will still be accessible, although in
a restricted way.

<center><h2><a name = "ql">QL Passwords</a></h2></center>
<P>
How often are you given something free? Quicklaw (&quot;QL&quot;),
the Canadian legal online system which carries case law, press
releases, and secondary literature, is available to you without
charge for most of the files. All faculty members should acquire
passwords. QL has frozen all of the students' passwords for the
summer months. As a result, all research assistants must use their
professor's passwords in order to do their online research. an
additional advantage in acquiring a password is that you have
the option of searching the system yourself at your office or
at home. All you need is a computer, modem and communications
software to hook yourself up.
<P>
Signing up for a password is easy. You can contact either Esther
Wan (ext. 4290) or Gian Medves (ext. 5537), and we will arrange
for a password package to be sent to you by QL. This package includes
the password, contract, and information booklets which you will
need in order to search QL. To activate the password, you must
sign the contract and return it to QL immediately. The Reference
Staff are also available if you should desire training on the
system. While QL may seem intimidating at first, you may soon
find yourself thoroughly addicted - not such a bad situation considering
that the system is free and can save you some time!

<center><h2><a name = "new">What's new in the Cataloguing Department?</a></h2></center>
<P>
Cataloguing has recently implemented online cataloguing on the
UTCat System. The cataloguers can now input the record directly
into the local system; the records will then appear instantly
in the online public catalogue.
<P>
For rush cataloguing requests, please call Mr. Rashid at ext.
4209.
<P>
Over the past year, Cataloguing has also been involved in the
Reports Organization Project which was designed to provide better
physical access to the collection. Reports and digest for Canada,
United States, and Britain have already been re-organized and
labelled, and work on Australian and New Zealand reports is currently
in progress.

<p>
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

Depuis plusieurs d&eacute;cennies, les pratiques commerciales internationales se sont raffin&eacute;es et tendent de plus en plus &agrave; s'uniformiser entre les diff&eacute;rents &Eacute;tats. Cette tendance vise particuli&egrave;rement les paiements internationaux et cons&eacute;quemment la fraude qui est susceptible de survenir &grave; tout moment dans le processus du paiement. 
<p>
Le cr&eacute;dit documentaire &eacute;tant le mode de paiement le plus utilis&eacute; sur les march&eacute;s internationaux, la question s'est pos&eacute;e de savoir ce qui advient des droits d'un acheteur ayant ouvert un
cr&eacute;dit documentaire envers son vendeur, lorsque ce dernier agit frauduleusement et cause un pr&eacute;judice &agrave; l'acheteur. 
<p>
Puisque les <cite>R&egave;gles et usances uniformes relatives aux cr&eacute;dits documentaires</cite><sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup> ou les l&eacute;gislations nationales, sous r&eacute;serve du <cite>Uniform Commercial Code</cite>,<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup> sont silencieuses &agrave; cet &eacute;gard, les tribunaux ont d&ucirc; prendre la rel&egrave;ve. M&ecirc;me si ceux-ci ont rendu quelques d&eacute;cisions d'une
importance capitale sur diff&eacute;rents aspects de la question depuis quelques ann&eacute;es, les juges de certains pays demeurent tout de m&ecirc;me divis&eacute;s &agrave; plusieurs niveaux. Cependant, on peut apercevoir &agrave; l'horizon une lueur d'espoir voulant que les principes de droit appliqu&eacute;s aux cr&eacute;dits documentaires se rapprochent de plus en plus. 
<p>
La pr&eacute;sente &eacute;tude vise d'une part la mise &agrave; jour du droit existant actuellement en cette mati&egrave;re ainsi qu'une r&eacute;vision sommaire des principaux concepts qui y sont sous-jacents et d'autre
part, l'analyse des tendances jurisprudentielles &agrave; survenir au cours des prochaines ann&eacute;es et particuli&egrave;rement, nous regarderons si l'uniformisation dont il est question ci-haut est envisageable
entre le Qu&eacute;bec, le Canada, les &Eacute;tats-Unis, l'Angleterre et la France. Nous verrons finalement l'influence de l'informatique sur le cr&eacute;dit documentaire afin de d&eacute;couvrir son impact au cours des
prochaines ann&eacute;es.
<p>
Dans un premier temps, nous verrons les grands principes du cr&eacute;dit documentaire, soit principalement le principe d'autonomie qui a pour cons&eacute;quence de rendre le contrat initial conclu entre les parties ind&eacute;pendant de la lettre de cr&eacute;dit &eacute;mise par une banque en vertu de ce contrat. Le principe de la stricte conformit&eacute; des documents pr&eacute;sent&eacute;s &agrave; la banque pour paiement nous donnera la premi&egrave;ere exception &agrave; la r&egrave;gle g&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'autonomie de
la lettre de cr&eacute;dit, soit la possibilit&eacute; dans certains cas d'accepter les documents malgr&eacute; le d&eacute;faut de conformit&eacute; de ceux-ci.
<p>
Par la suite, nous attaquerons la seconde exception au principe d'autonomie, soit le cas de fraude, et nous verrons au
cours de cette discussion que la stricte conformit&eacute; des documents est parfois indissociable de la fraude. Nous analyserons d'abord les cas d'ouverture de la fraude, <i>i.e.</i>, par qui elle doit &ecirc;tre commise, &agrave; qui elle est opposable et quelle cat&eacute;gorie de fraude est admissible. Ensuite, nous regarderons l'avenir r&eacute;serv&eacute; &agrave; la fraude pour terminer avec les recours offerts &agrave; la victime, en l'occurrence, le donneur d'ordre. 
<p>
<h3>2. Principes fondamentaux du cr&eacute;dit documentaire</h3>

2.1 LE PRINCIPE DE L'AUTONOMIE DE LA LETTRE DE CR&Eacute;DIT
<p>
Lorsque deux parties contractent ensemble dans le but d'effectuer une transaction internationale, elles doivent s'entendre pour le choix d'un mode de paiement qui satisfera leurs besoins respectifs. Si les parties d&eacute;sirent utiliser le moyen de paiement le plus s&ucirc;r, alors le cr&eacute;dit documentaire, &eacute;galement appel&eacute; lettre de cr&eacute;dit,<sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup> s'offre &agrave; elles. Il s'agit d'un contrat conclu par le donneur d'ordre, &agrave; la demande du b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire, avec une banque, dite la banque &eacute;mettrice ou banque du donneur d'ordre, et qui pr&eacute;voit que la banque paiera, par l'interm&eacute;diaire d'une autre banque, le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire sur pr&eacute;sentation de certains documents stipul&eacute;s dans l'accr&eacute;ditif. Nonobstant que ces deux contrats paraissent &ecirc;tre li&eacute;s, il est unanime en jurisprudence et en doctrine que ceux-ci sont compl&egrave;tement ind&eacute;pendants. D'ailleurs, ce principe d'autonomie est explicitement reconnu par l'article 3 des <cite>R.U.U.</cite><sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup> et le paragraphe 5--114(1) du <cite>U.C.C.</cite><sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup>
<p>
Puisque les <cite>R.U.U.</cite> sont utilis&eacute;es par de nombreuses banques dans le monde lors de leurs transactions internationales, on comprend vite l'importance de cette disposition.
<p>
Il y a une vingtaine d'ann&eacute;es environ survenait un litige relativement &agrave; l'&eacute;mission d'une lettre de cr&eacute;dit irr&eacute;vocable et confirm&eacute;e. Dans cette histoire,<sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup> d&eacute;sormais c&eacute;l&egrave;bre dans le domaine des lettres de cr&eacute;dit, <cite>Angelica-Whitewear
Ltd.</cite>, le donneur d'ordre, contestait le paiement fait par la <cite>Banque de Nouvelle-&Eacute;cosse</cite>, la banque &eacute;mettrice, au b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire, <cite>Protective Clothing Co.</cite> On all&eacute;guait d'une part que certains documents n'&eacute;taient pas conformes et d'autre part, que d'autres documents faisaient l'objet d'une fraude. 
<p>
Le juge Le Dain, rendant jugement pour la Cour, confirme au tout d&eacute;but de son expos&eacute; le principe de l'autonomie de la lettre de cr&eacute;dit, dans un passage fr&eacute;quemment repris:
<blockquote>
Le principe fondamental r&eacute;gissant les lettres de cr&eacute;dit documentaires et la caract&eacute;ristique qui leur donne leur utilit&eacute; et leur efficacit&eacute; commerciales internationales sont que l'obligation de la banque &eacute;mettrice d'honorer une traite tir&eacute;e sur un cr&eacute;dit lorsqu'elle est accompagn&eacute;e de documents qui pr&eacute;sentent l'apparence de conformit&eacute; avec les conditions du cr&eacute;dit est ind&eacute;pendante du contrat sous-jacent &agrave; l'&eacute;gard duquel le cr&eacute;dit a &eacute;t&eacute; accord&eacute;.&quot;<sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Il va de soi que la jurisprudence qu&eacute;b&eacute;coise et canadienne subs&eacute;quente &agrave; cette d&eacute;cision a suivi l'opinion du juge Le Dain.<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup> De m&ecirc;me, l'unanimit&eacute; du principe de l'autonomie du cr&eacute;dit documentaire se refl&egrave;te &agrave; l'&eacute;tranger,<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup> particuli&egrave;rement aux &Eacute;tats-Unis,<sup><a href="#ten">10</a></sup> en Angleterre<sup><a href="#eleven">11</a></sup> et en France.<sup><a href="#twelve">12</a></sup> On ne peut en dire autant de l'exigence de v&eacute;rification des documents.
<p>
LE PRINCIPE DE LA STRICTE CONFORMIT&Eacute; DES DOCUMENTS
<p>
2.2.1   <i>Nature de la stricte conformit&eacute; des documents</i><br>
&Eacute;tant donn&eacute; que la lettre de cr&eacute;dit repose sur le principe que la banque r&eacute;alisatrice paiera le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire sur pr&eacute;sentation par lui des documents exig&eacute;s dans le cr&eacute;dit documentaire, les articles 13 et suivants des <cite>R.U.U.</cite> pr&eacute;voient les modalit&eacute;s de v&eacute;rification desdits documents par la banque &eacute;mettrice, interm&eacute;diaire ou r&eacute;alisatrice. 
<p>
Selon l'article 13, les documents doivent pr&eacute;senter d'une part &quot;l'apparence de conformit&eacute; avec les termes et conditions du cr&eacute;dit&quot; et d'autre part, ils doivent &ecirc;tre compatibles entre eux. Ces deux conditions <i>sine qua non</i> sont cumulatives et si au moins une de celles-ci ne peut &ecirc;tre remplie, la banque peut refuser de lever les documents. Cette disposition stipule de plus que ladite apparence de conformit&eacute; est d&eacute;termin&eacute;e selon &quot;les pratiques bancaires internationales&quot;. La Chambre de commerce internationale (ci-apr&egrave;s, la C.C.I.) laisse donc une certaine latitude aux banques et aux tribunaux dans l'analyse de la conformit&eacute; des documents.
<p>
Autant le principe de l'autonomie de la lettre de cr&eacute;dit avait su cr&eacute;er l'unanimit&eacute;, autant celui de la stricte conformit&eacute; des documents pr&eacute;sente des nuances selon les diff&eacute;rents pays partis
&agrave; l'op&eacute;ration du cr&eacute;dit documentaire. L'importance de conna&icirc;tre non seulement les tendances actuelles, mais le sens de l'&eacute;volution de cette notion pr&eacute;sente un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t certain dans l'&eacute;tude de la fraude, car plus strict sera l'examen des documents, plus il sera difficile pour le donneur d'ordre de soulever l'exception de fraude pour ne pas payer le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire ou la banque &eacute;mettrice. De m&ecirc;me, une interpr&eacute;tation stricte de l'obligation de v&eacute;rification des documents restreindra la responsabilit&eacute; des banques.<sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup> Nous nous retrouvons maintenant au premier carrefour de notre &eacute;tude de la fraude, soit les tendances actuelles dans l'analyse de la stricte conformit&eacute; des documents.
<p>
2.2.2   <i>Tendances actuelles</i>
<p>
2.2.2.1   <i>Interpr&eacute;tation stricte</i><br>
Le juge Le Dain, dans <cite>Angelica</cite>, traite de la question de la stricte conformit&eacute; en deux &eacute;tapes, soit l'apparence de conformit&eacute; et la concordance des documents entre eux.<sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup> Apr&egrave;s avoir regard&eacute; l'&eacute;tat du droit sur la question en Angleterre et aux &Eacute;tats-Unis, il conclut que l'apparence de conformit&eacute; doit &ecirc;tre interpr&eacute;t&eacute;e restrictivement. &Agrave; ce niveau, il suit la Chambre des lords dans la d&eacute;cision <cite>Equitable Trust Co. of New York v. Dawson Partners, Ltd.</cite><sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup> qui mentionne particuli&egrave;rement: &quot;Il n'y a pas de place pour des documents qui sont presque identiques, ou qui auront le m&ecirc;me effet.&quot; Le magistrat laisse tout de m&ecirc;me la porte entrouverte pour le cas o&ugrave; des variations mineures surviendraient.<sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup>
<p>
Les commentaires que nous avons exprim&eacute;s au sujet de cette d&eacute;cision consid&eacute;r&eacute;e sous son rapport avec l'autonomie de la lettre de cr&eacute;dit sont &eacute;galement valables au niveau de la
conformit&eacute; des documents. Tr&egrave;s r&eacute;cemment, la Cour sup&eacute;rieure du Qu&eacute;bec s'est prononc&eacute;e sur le sujet. J. Pascal Inc. avait command&eacute; de Corin International (HK) Inc., la demanderesse, du mat&eacute;riel de camping qu'elle s'engageait &agrave; payer au moyen d'une lettre de cr&eacute;dit &eacute;mise par la Banque de Montr&eacute;al, la d&eacute;fenderesse. Parmi les documents exig&eacute;s se trouvait un certificat d'origine. Celui-ci n'avait pas &eacute;t&eacute; produit par Corin sous pr&eacute;texte de l'impossibilit&eacute; de l'obtenir. Le tribunal &eacute;tant d'avis contraire, il a conclu &agrave; ce que la conformit&eacute; des documents n'&eacute;tait pas respect&eacute;e et a rejet&eacute; l'action de
Corin.<sup><a href="#seventeen">17</a></sup> La Cour a suivi &agrave; la lettre la d&eacute;cision du juge Le Dain, confirmant ainsi l'interpr&eacute;tation stricte de l'apparence de conformit&eacute;.<sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup> La Cour opine &eacute;galement dans le m&ecirc;me sens que le juge Le Dain pour ce qui est des exceptions admises &agrave; la r&egrave;gle de non-conformit&eacute; des documents, <i>i.e.</i>, qu'elle permet que &quot;des d&eacute;tails insignifiants&quot; n'emp&ecirc;chent point le cr&eacute;dit documentaire de produire quelque effet. 
<p>
Les tribunaux anglais, apr&egrave;s s'en &ecirc;tre tenus &agrave; une interpr&eacute;tation tr&egrave;s restrictive de la notion de stricte conformit&eacute; des documents,<sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a></sup> semblent &ecirc;tre partis dans une digression, l&eacute;g&egrave;re faut-il le pr&eacute;ciser, vers la possibilit&eacute; pour une banque d'accepter de payer un b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire lorsqu'il existe des variations tr&egrave;s l&eacute;g&egrave;res et insignifiantes. Ils exigent cependant que celles-ci n'aient aucune influence en soi sur la qualit&eacute; des documents qui sont pr&eacute;sent&eacute;s, qui apparaissent donc conformes ou m&ecirc;me compatibles entre eux. Un auteur a tent&eacute; de temp&eacute;rer l'arr&ecirc;t <cite>Equitable Trust Co. of New York v. Dawson Partners</cite><sup><a href="#twenty">20</a></sup> en affirmant au sujet de cette d&eacute;cision:
<blockquote>
The strict compliance rule to which Lord Sumner drew attention in <cite>Equitable Trust Co. New York v. Dawson Partners</cite> does not extend to the dotting of i's and the crossing of t's or the obvious typographical errors either in the credit or the documents. Because of the wide variation in the language to be found in both, it is impossible to be dogmatic or even to generalize. <i>Each case is to be considered on its own merits</i> and the bank's obligation may obviously be most difficult to fulfil.<sup><a href="#twenty1">21</a></sup> (nos italiques).



</blockquote>



Chaque cas est un cas d'esp&egrave;ce et il nous est difficile de fixer les bornes d'une fa&ccedil;on g&eacute;n&eacute;rale. En effet, malgr&eacute; l'arr&ecirc;t <cite>Westpac Banking Corporation et al. v.

En France, on reconna&icirc;t bien s&ucirc;r le principe de la stricte conformit&eacute; des documents.<sup><a href="#twenty4">24</a></sup> Sous r&eacute;serve de l'exception de fraude, y a-t-il moyen de passer



outre &agrave; ce principe lorsque des erreurs minimes touchent les documents pr&eacute;sent&eacute;s? La jurisprudence et la doctrine fran&ccedil;aises abondent &agrave; peu pr&egrave;s dans le m&ecirc;me sens que les tribunaux canadiens et qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois. La doctrine retient comme d&eacute;finition de divergence insignifiante, &quot;toute divergence qui appara&icirc;tra comme telle de mani&egrave;re <i>`&eacute;vidente' &agrave; toute personne jugeant la question sans faire appel &agrave; aucune connaissance sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;e de n'importe quel genre.</i>&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty5">25</a></sup> Le professeur Lesguillons nous donne quelques exemples de divergences insignifiantes en soulignant bien



l'importance de ne pas en tenir compte lors de la v&eacute;rification des documents. Il r&eacute;f&egrave;re entre autres &agrave; la d&eacute;cision <cite>Banque commerciale du B&eacute;nin et al. c. Soc. Banco de Santander</cite>,<sup><a href="#twenty6">26</a></sup> dans laquelle la mention &quot;Yacasse 38&quot;



apparaissant sur le connaissement maritime &eacute;quivalait &agrave; l'expression &quot;Yacasse ou navire de remplacement&quot;. Cette d&eacute;cision est int&eacute;ressante d'un autre point de vue puisqu'elle suit deux



anciennes d&eacute;cisions fran&ccedil;aises &agrave; cet &eacute;gard.<sup><a href="#twenty7">27</a></sup>

2.2.2.2   Interpr&eacute;tation lib&eacute;rale<br>



Le droit am&eacute;ricain, contrairement &agrave; ceux des autres pays susmentionn&eacute;s, n'interpr&egrave;te pas la conformit&eacute; des documents avec autant de rigueur que ceux-ci. Soit que certains juges utilisent l'approche de la stricte conformit&eacute; des documents, soit que d'autres s'en tiennent &agrave; une approche &quot;en substance&quot;. Selon cette derni&egrave;re, il s'agit de juger en &eacute;quit&eacute; plut&ocirc;t que selon la conformit&eacute; des documents. &agrave; la base de cette th&eacute;orie reposent deux d&eacute;cisions, soit <cite>Banco Espanol de Credito v. State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co.</cite><sup><a href="#twenty8">28</a></sup> et <cite>Flagship Cruises, Ltd. v. New England Merchants National Bank of Boston</cite>.<sup><a href="#twenty9">29</a></sup> Quelques auteurs partagent leur point de vue,<sup><a href="#thirty">30</a></sup> mais en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, cette tendance demeure minoritaire.<sup><a href="#thirty1">31</a></sup> Ces derni&egrave;res d&eacute;cisions sont en quelque sorte le reflet de l'arr&ecirc;t anglais <cite>Equitable Trust Co. v. Dawson Partners</cite>.<sup><a href="#thirty2">32</a></sup> On pr&eacute;tend que le point de vue appuyant la doctrine de la conformit&eacute; substantielle affaiblit l'efficacit&eacute; du cr&eacute;dit documentaire et retarde le paiement au b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire.<sup><a href="#thirty3">33</a></sup>

2.2.3   <i>Tendances futures</i>



<p>



2.2.3.1   <i>Vers une uniformisation de la stricte conformit&eacute; des documents</i>



<br>



Le survol des tendances actuelles en mati&egrave;re d'exigence d'apparence de conformit&eacute; et de concordance des documents entre eux nous a permis de constater que la plupart des &Eacute;tats &eacute;tudi&eacute;s respectent &agrave; peu pr&egrave;s les m&ecirc;mes crit&egrave;res dans la



d&eacute;termination de ce qui constitue une exception au principe de la stricte conformit&eacute; des documents, si l'on exclut quelques causes isol&eacute;es &agrave; l'effet contraire. Ceci n'est pas surprenant, consid&eacute;rant l'influence majeure de la jurisprudence anglaise sur le droit anglais, fran&ccedil;ais et sur notre droit. Pour sa part, l'arr&ccirc;t <cite>Angelica</cite> fut suivi quasi unanimement par nos tribunaux, et a m&ecirc;me eu une influence certaine en France.<sup><a href="#thirty4">34</a></sup> Quant aux &Eacute;tats-Unis, nous avons vu qu'en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, les tribunaux de ce pays ont adopt&eacute; des r&egrave;gles similaires aux n&ocirc;tres par rapport &agrave; l'acceptation de divergences insignifiantes touchant les documents stipul&eacute;s &agrave; l'accr&eacute;ditif.



<p>



Apr&egrave;s avoir trac&eacute; le portrait des r&eacute;cents d&eacute;veloppements sur ce sujet, il appara&icirc;t clairement qu'au cours des prochaines ann&eacute;es, les tribunaux, y compris les tribunaux am&eacute;ricains, s'en tiendront &agrave; une approche restrictive de l'analyse de la v&eacute;rification de la stricte conformit&eacute; des documents par les banques. Cette tendance d&eacute;coule du besoin d'assurer le respect du principe de l'autonomie des lettres de cr&eacute;dit comme cela se passe aujourd'hui, sous r&eacute;serve de la possibilit&eacute; pour les banques de lever les documents sujets &agrave; des erreurs minimes sans encourir le risque d'en &ecirc;tre tenues responsables. Quant &agrave; la doctrine am&eacute;ricaine de la conformit&eacute; substantielle, elle n'est certainement pas vou&eacute;e &agrave; un grand avenir, sa popularit&eacute; se faisant toujours timide apr&egrave;s plusieurs ann&eacute;es d'existence. 



<p>



Selon nous, cependant, les vraies tendances du futur sont li&eacute;es au d&eacute;veloppement technologique et &agrave; son influence sur le cr&eacute;dit documentaire.



<p>



2.2.3.2   <i>Influence de l'&Eacute;.D.I. sur la stricte conformit&eacute; des documents</i><sup><a href="#thirty5">35</a></sup><br>



Les commentaires ci-dessus sont valables en autant que les documents exig&eacute;s par le cr&eacute;dit documentaire soient des documents traditionnels, <i>i.e.</i>, des documents sur support papier. Cependant, la pratique actuelle du cr&eacute;dit documentaire est en pleine &quot;r&eacute;volution&quot; depuis l'utilisation de



l'informatique.<sup><a href="#thirty6">36</a></sup> Celle-ci est devenue tellement importante, ou tout au moins le sera dans quelques ann&eacute;es, que la C.C.I. a adopt&eacute; une r&eacute;glementation &agrave; ce sujet en 1988.<sup><a href="#thirty7">37</a></sup> Cependant, puisque les r&egrave;gles de l'<cite>U.N.C.I.D.</cite> sont incompl&egrave;tes en soi, la Commission des nations unies pour le d&eacute;veloppement du commerce international (ci-apr&egrave;s, la C.N.U.D.C.I.) a d&eacute;j&agrave; pr&eacute;par&eacute; un projet de r&egrave;gles r&eacute;gissant les documents informatis&eacute;s et visant en quelque sorte la prolif&eacute;ration de diverses r&egrave;gles plus ou moins disparates.<sup><a href="#thirty8">38</a></sup> Au niveau de la v&eacute;rification des documents, on voit d&eacute;j&agrave; appara&icirc;tre des probl&egrave;mes qu'on avait peine &agrave; imaginer il y a quelques ann&eacute;es seulement.



<p>



Sous r&eacute;serve de la signature devenue cod&eacute;e,<sup><a href="#thirty9">39</a></sup> la v&eacute;rification des documents informatis&eacute;s se fait par un ordinateur, et non manuellement. Actuellement, l'article 39 des <cite>R.U.U.</cite> permet certains &eacute;carts concernant le montant du cr&eacute;dit, le prix unitaire ou la quantit&eacute; des marchandises. De m&ecirc;me, tel que discut&eacute; auparavant, les tribunaux permettent le non respect des r&egrave;gles de stricte conformit&eacute; en cas



d'erreurs minimes. Tel que le mentionne Caprioli:



<blockquote>



Avec le cr&eacute;dit &eacute;lectronique, l'op&eacute;ration devient d&eacute;shumanis&eacute;e, la moindre irr&eacute;gularit&eacute; entra&icirc;nerait inexorablement le rejet du document informatique non conforme aux conditions du cr&eacute;dit et un refus de la banque. Ainsi la m&eacute;thode du soin raisonnable devient inapplicable dans le cadre d'un examen ex&eacute;cut&eacute; par un programme informatique. (...) De la m&ecirc;me mani&egrave;re, si les documents ne sont pas compatibles entre eux &agrave; quelque titre que ce soit, le rejet des donn&eacute;es bloquera le paiement. L&agrave; aussi, le concept d'examen assorti d'un soin raisonnable n'aura pas lieu d'&ecirc;tre.<sup><a href="#forty">40</a></sup>



</blockquote>



Autrement dit, puisque l'ordinateur refusera un document pour la moindre erreur, si minime et insignifiante soit-elle, il faudra pr&eacute;voir, &agrave; d&eacute;faut d'am&eacute;liorer le syst&egrave;me informatique, une seconde &eacute;tape de v&eacute;rification des documents, manuelle cette fois.<sup><a href="#forty1">41</a></sup> En effet, il peut &ecirc;tre difficile de concevoir comment un ordinateur pourra &ecirc;tre programm&eacute; pour laisser passer des erreurs insignifiantes, car tel que nous l'avons vu aux sections pr&eacute;c&eacute;dentes, la jurisprudence actuelle ne nous a donn&eacute; que des bornes &agrave; respecter dans l'&eacute;valuation de ce qui constitue des erreurs minimes, et avant tout quelques exemples de cas particuliers. Bref, selon nous, chaque cas



&eacute;tant un cas d'esp&egrave;ce, la v&eacute;rification manuelle pourra difficilement &circ;tre mise de c&ocirc;t&eacute;, du moins &agrave; court terme, et ce, m&ecirc;me dans l'hypoth&egrave;se de la  d&eacute;couverte d'une solution pour le probl&egrave;me des documents n&eacute;gociables.<sup><a href="#forty2">42</a></sup>



<p>



<h3>3.  Exception au principe d'autonomie: La fraude</h3>







Nous avons vu &agrave; la section 2.1 que le cr&eacute;dit documentaire est caract&eacute;ris&eacute; principalement par son autonomie par rapport au contrat de base. Nous avons vu &eacute;galement que les



documents pr&eacute;sent&eacute;s pour paiement doivent &ecirc;tre conformes et concorder entre eux, &agrave; d&eacute;faut de quoi les banques peuvent les rejeter. Une premi&egrave;re exception &agrave; l'autonomie du cr&eacute;dit documentaire a trait aux l&eacute;g&egrave;res diff&eacute;rences qui peuvent affecter les documents pr&eacute;sent&eacute;s pour paiement. Dans ce cas, la banque peut les accepter sans entra&icirc;ner sa responsabilit&eacute;. Cependant, lorsqu'il y a parfaite conformit&eacute; des documents ou &agrave; la limite, si ceux-ci ne sont pas tout &agrave; fait conformes d&ucirc; &agrave; des erreurs minimes, ce qui est susceptible de se produire, le donneur d'ordre pourra s'opposer au paiement de la lettre de cr&eacute;dit si celui-ci est le fruit d'une fraude. <i>Fraus omnia corrumpit</i>, dit l'adage ... Les <cite>R.U.U.</cite> sont silencieuses &agrave; propos



de la fraude, laissant le tout aux tribunaux.<sup><a href="#forty3">43</a></sup> Cependant, le paragraphe 5--114(2) du <cite>U.C.C.</cite><sup><a href="#forty4">44</a></sup> admet la fraude comme exception au principe d'autonomie lorsqu'elle est commise par le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire. Apr&egrave;s avoir pass&eacute; en revue les diff&eacute;rents crit&egrave;res de la fraude, nous serons &agrave; m&ecirc;me de d&eacute;finir celle-ci et de regarder ce que l'avenir nous promet &agrave; son sujet.



<p>



3.1   CRIT&Egrave;RES D'ADMISSIBILIT&Eacute; DE LA FRAUDE: TENDANCES ACTUELLES



<p>



3.1.1   <i>Auteurs de la fraude</i>



<p>



3.1.1.1   <i>B&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire</i><br>



La d&eacute;cision <cite>Sztejn v. J. Henry Schroder Banking Corporation et al.</cite><sup><a href="#forty5">45</a></sup> est sans contredit la pierre angulaire concernant la fraude en mati&egrave;re de



cr&eacute;dit documentaire. Dans cette histoire, le vendeur, qui &eacute;tait &eacute;galement le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire, avait vendu des marchandises de pacotille en remplacement de celles de qualit&eacute;. La Cour avait accueilli la demande du donneur d'ordre contre la banque &eacute;mettrice



qui avait d&eacute;j&agrave; pay&eacute; le vendeur. Quoique cette d&eacute;cision ne f&ucirc;t pas toujours suivie ult&eacute;rieurement, la plupart des magistrats de diff&eacute;rents pays ont rendu jugement dans le m&ecirc;me sens. 



<p>



La Cour supr&ecirc;me du Canada, dans la d&eacute;cision <cite>Banque de Nouvelle-&Eacute;cosse c. Angelica-Whitewear Ltd. et al.</cite>, mentionne d'ailleurs &agrave; ce sujet: 



<blockquote>



&quot;... je crois qu'il est pr&eacute;f&eacute;rable dans l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t de l'uniformit&eacute; qui est si importante dans ce domaine du droit, que nous suivions la r&egrave;gle affirm&eacute;e dans l'arr&ecirc;t <cite>Sztejn</cite>, apr&egrave;s examen de l'opinion contraire, adopt&eacute;e par le paragraphe 5--114(2) du <cite>Uniform Commercial Code</cite> et apparemment accept&eacute;e par la jurisprudence anglaise.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty6">46</a></sup>



</blockquote>



Il est donc clair en droit canadien et qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois que seule la fraude commise par le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire est admise, y compris celle o&ugrave; il y a particip&eacute;. Tel &eacute;tait notre droit avant la d&eacute;cision de la Cour supr&ecirc;me, mais il n'existe aucune &eacute;quivoque maintenant.



D'ailleurs, les d&eacute;cisions r&eacute;centes sont au m&ecirc;me effet.<sup><a href="#forty7">47</a></sup>



<p>



Bien s&ucirc;r, si le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire devient au courant de la fraude post&eacute;rieurement &agrave; l'acceptation ou au paiement par la banque &eacute;mettrice, il sera consid&eacute;r&eacute; &ecirc;tre de bonne foi.<sup><a href="#forty8">48</a></sup>



<p>



L'acceptabilit&eacute; en droit &eacute;tranger que la fraude commise par le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire soit une exception au principe de l'autonomie de la lettre de cr&eacute;dit est reconnue unanimement.<sup><a href="#forty9">49</a></sup> Cependant, que se passe-t-il lorsque la fraude est commise par un tiers et que le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire est de bonne foi et n'est aucunement impliqu&eacute;?



<p>



3.1.1.2   <i>Des tiers dans la transaction commerciale</i><br>



Tel que nous l'avons soulign&eacute; dans la section pr&eacute;c&eacute;dente, le juge Le Dain a d&eacute;cid&eacute; de garder la m&ecirc;me ligne de conduite que la d&eacute;cision <cite>Sztejn</cite>. Il restreint donc les cas d'ouverture de l'exception de fraude aux seuls cas o&ugrave; elle est commise par le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire ou avec sa complicit&eacute;. Le cas d'une fraude commise par un tiers sans la connaissance du b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire ne peut emp&ecirc;cher celui-ci de recevoir son d&ucirc;.<sup><a href="#fifty">50</a></sup> Par exemple, dans <cite>Geestem&uuml;nder Bank AG c. Barzelex Inc.</cite>, la Cour d'appel a reconnu ce principe, refusant toutefois en l'esp&egrave;ce de reconna&icirc;tre que la banque appelante, &eacute;mettrice d'un deuxi&egrave;me cr&eacute;dit documentaire en faveur du fournisseur du vendeur, avait eu connaissance de la fausset&eacute; des connaissements, rejetant ainsi la d&eacute;cision du juge de premi&egrave;re instance.<sup><a href="#fifty1">51</a></sup>



<p>



La transaction commerciale &agrave; laquelle nous faisons r&eacute;f&eacute;rence n'implique que les parties au contrat de base. Dans ce cas, les banques sont des tiers, m&ecirc;me si elles sont parties au cr&eacute;dit documentaire. D'une fa&ccedil;on ou d'une autre, si elles ont connaissance de la fraude commise par qui que ce soit, elles seront tenues responsables.<sup><a href="#fifty2">52</a></sup>



<p>



En pratique, il est relativement difficile de tenir les banques responsables car celles-ci trouvent protection le plus souvent derri&egrave;re l'exigence de stricte conformit&eacute; qu'on leur demande lors de la v&eacute;rification des documents, exigence qui est tr&egrave;s rigoureuse, tel que nous l'avons vu pr&eacute;c&eacute;demment.



<p>



Les juristes anglais et am&eacute;ricains ont la m&ecirc;me conception que nous de la fraude commise par un tiers, puisque ceux-ci ont eu une grande influence sur l'&eacute;tat actuel de notre droit et obligent &agrave; ce que le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire soit partie &agrave; la fraude.<sup><a href="#fifty3">53</a></sup> Il semble que les Fran&ccedil;ais ont &eacute;t&eacute; &quot;positivement&quot; influenc&eacute;s par la d&eacute;cision <cite>United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd. v. Royal Bank of Canada</cite>,<sup><a href="#fifty4">54</a></sup> selon les commentaires de Caprioli. Quoique celui-ci nous cite une cause ayant &eacute;t&eacute; jug&eacute;e avant cette d&eacute;cision anglaise, il affirme son accord avec cette



derni&egrave;re.<sup><a href="#fifty5">55</a></sup>



<p>



3.1.2  <i>Opposabilit&eacute; de la fraude aux tiers de bonne foi</i><br>



Les cons&eacute;quences d'une fraude seront plus ou moins n&eacute;fastes selon les personnes vis&eacute;es par celle-ci. Lorsque la traite tombe entre les mains d'un d&eacute;tenteur r&eacute;gulier, les articles 55 et 



suivants ainsi que l'article 73 de la <i>Loi sur les lettres de change</i><sup><a href="#fifty6">56</a></sup> pr&eacute;voient que celui-ci est r&eacute;put&eacute; &ecirc;tre de bonne foi et d&eacute;tient la lettre libre de tout vice de titre. La Cour supr&ecirc;me du Canada a reconnu qu'en vertu de ce principe, la fraude affectant une lettre de cr&eacute;dit n'est pas opposable au d&eacute;tenteur r&eacute;gulier de la traite.<sup><a href="#fifty7">57</a></sup> Il faut cependant ajouter un b&eacute;mol &agrave; ceci: lorsque la fraude est prouv&eacute;e, celui qui pr&eacute;tend au statut de d&eacute;tenteur r&eacute;gulier doit d&eacute;montrer son droit.<sup><a href="#fifty8">58</a></sup>



<p>



Dans la cause <cite>Les industries Almac Lt&eacute;e c. Al-Arishi</cite>,<sup><a href="#fifty9">59</a></sup> le d&eacute;fendeur all&eacute;guait &ecirc;tre un d&eacute;tenteur r&eacute;gulier d&ucirc; &agrave; l'acquisition de la lettre de garantie par voie de n&eacute;gociation. La preuve a d&eacute;montr&eacute; d'une



part que le d&eacute;fendeur n'avait point obtenu cette lettre par n&eacute;gociation et d'autre part, que celui-ci avait commis une fraude &agrave; l'endroit de la demanderesse. En l'esp&egrave;ce, le d&eacute;fendeur avait



mal inform&eacute; la demanderesse des conditions tr&egrave;s difficiles pour l'installation du mat&eacute;riel en Arabie Saoudite, domicile du d&eacute;fendeur.<sup><a href="#sixty">60</a></sup> Celui-ci, devant l'inex&eacute;cution par la demanderesse de sa contrepartie, a fait part de ce d&eacute;faut &agrave; sa banque pour que la garantie soit mise &agrave; ex&eacute;cution, et <cite>Les Industries Almac Lt&eacute;e</cite> ont r&eacute;pliqu&eacute; par voie d'une injonction interlocutoire. La Cour a d&eacute;cid&eacute;, &agrave;



bon droit selon nous, et tout en reconnaissant la controverse entourant cette question,<sup><a href="#sixty1">61</a></sup> que le d&eacute;fendeur n'ayant pas n&eacute;goci&eacute; la traite, il n'avait pas la qualit&eacute; de d&eacute;tenteur r&eacute;gulier et en cons&eacute;quence, ne pouvait s'opposer &agrave;



la demande d'injonction.<sup><a href="#sixty2">62</a></sup> Bien qu'il s'agisse d'une lettre de garantie et non d'une lettre de cr&eacute;dit au sens strict, cette d&eacute;cision trouve tout de m&ecirc;me application dans la pr&eacute;sente discussion.<sup><a href="#sixty3">63</a></sup>



<p>



Les droits anglais et am&eacute;ricain abondent dans le m&ecirc;me sens que le n&ocirc;tre pour les raisons mentionn&eacute;es dans la section pr&eacute;c&eacute;dente.<sup><a href="#sixty4">64</a></sup> Par exemple, on a refus&eacute; le paiement au d&eacute;tenteur d'une traite qui n'a pu prouver son statut de d&eacute;tenteur r&eacute;gulier alors que le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire &eacute;tait responsable d'une fraude.<sup><a href="#sixty5">65</a></sup>



<p>



Le droit fran&ccedil;ais diff&egrave;re de notre droit des effets de commerce, qui a son origine dans la <cite>Common law</cite>, en ce sens que la loi ne reconna&icirc;t pas au porteur, m&ecirc;me l&eacute;gitime, les m&ecirc;mes d&eacute;fenses qu'au d&eacute;tenteur r&eacute;gulier que l'on conna&icirc;t chez nous, &eacute;tant muette &agrave; ce sujet.<sup><a href="#sixty6">66</a></sup> D'ailleurs, pour que le porteur se qualifie de porteur l&eacute;gitime, il doit d&eacute;montrer que la lettre lui a &eacute;t&eacute; remise



r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement.<sup><a href="#sixty7">67</a></sup> On en d&eacute;duit qu'une fraude affectant la lettre de cr&eacute;dit serait opposable &agrave; un porteur fran&ccedil;ais, m&ecirc;me si



celui-ci &eacute;tait un tiers dans la transaction.



<p>



3.1.3  <i>Cat&eacute;gories de fraude</i><br>



Il existe une distinction entre la fraude mat&eacute;rielle et la fraude intellectuelle. Selon Mattout, il y a fraude mat&eacute;rielle &quot;lorsque l'un des documents pr&eacute;vus au cr&eacute;dit est faux apocryphe, au sens o&ugrave; il y a contrefa&ccedil;on ou qu'il a &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;mis par quelqu'un qui n'en avait pas le pouvoir, dans l'intention de nuire.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty8">68</a></sup> La fraude intellectuelle se retrouve quand: 



<blockquote>



&quot;... elle est constitu&eacute;e par des documents authentiques comportant de fausses &eacute;nonciations, mais pr&eacute;sentant toute apparence de conformit&eacute;. Elle pose tous les probl&egrave;mes rencontr&eacute;s dans la fraude mat&eacute;rielle plus un: elle impliquera g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement la prise en consid&eacute;ration du contrat commercial, de la marchandise, c'est-&agrave;-dire de d&eacute;passer la r&egrave;gle de base du cr&eacute;dit documentaire!&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty9">69</a></sup>



</blockquote>



Le premier genre de fraude ne semble pas poser de probl&egrave;mes en soi, mais qu'en est-il de la fraude intellectuelle: est-elle admise comme exception au principe de l'autonomie de la lettre de cr&eacute;dit?



<p>



3.1.3.1  <i>Fraude dans les documents stipul&eacute;s &agrave; l'accr&eacute;ditif</i><br>



La fraude mat&eacute;rielle est assimil&eacute;e habituellement &agrave; de fausses dates de livraison ou &agrave; de fausses &eacute;nonciations, soit d'ordre g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, soit concernant la description des marchandises



dans les documents de transport ou d'autres sortes de documents.<sup><a href="#seventy">70</a></sup>



<p>



Un tribunal am&eacute;ricain a d&eacute;fini la fraude dans les documents comme &eacute;tant: &quot;such a document would be one that is completely forged or drawn up without any underlying basis in fact, one that is



but partly spurious or a document which has been materially altered.&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy1">71</a></sup> En l'esp&egrave;ce, il y avait eu substitution d'une annexe &agrave; la lettre de cr&eacute;dit.



<p>



Comme le rappelait l'arr&ecirc;t <cite>United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd. v. Royal Bank of Canada</cite>,<sup><a href="#seventy2">72</a></sup> le devoir de la banque se limite &agrave;



l'examen des documents selon ce qui appara&icirc;t &agrave; leur face m&ecirc;me. C'est d'ailleurs ce que mentionne le paragraphe 13(a) des <cite>R.U.U.</cite> De plus, l'article 15 des <cite>R.U.U.</cite> d&eacute;gage la banque de toute responsabilit&eacute; pour ce qui est de l'exactitude, de l'authenticit&eacute;, la falsification ou l'effet juridique des documents. Dans le cas o&ugrave; une fraude mat&eacute;rielle passerait



inaper&ccedil;ue aux yeux vigilants de la banque et que celle-ci effectuerait un paiement au b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire, les autorit&eacute;s sont unanimes de nos jours pour affirmer que le donneur d'ordre aurait un recours sur la base de la fraude commise par le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire et affectant les documents exig&eacute;s dans l'accr&eacute;ditif.<sup><a href="#seventy3">73</a></sup>



<p> 



3.1.3.2   <i>Fraude dans le contrat de base</i><br>



La question de savoir si une fraude tirant son origine dans le contrat de base liant les parties peut &ecirc;tre soulev&eacute;e par le donneur d'ordre est l&eacute;g&egrave;rement controvers&eacute;e. Au Canada,



l'arr&ecirc;t <cite>Angelica</cite> a mis un terme &agrave; toute ambigu&iuml;t&eacute; en affirmant que la fraude doit viser tant le c&ocirc;t&eacute; mat&eacute;riel qu'intellectuel. Le juge Le Dain s'appuie principalement sur les d&eacute;cisions <cite>Sztejn v. J. Henry Schroder Banking Corp.</cite><sup><a href="#seventy4">74</a></sup> et <cite>United Bank Ltd. v. Cambridge Sporting Goods</cite><sup><a href="#seventy5">75</a></sup> en soulignant que la difficult&eacute; de tracer la ligne s&eacute;parant la



fraude mat&eacute;rielle de la fraude intellectuelle constitue un argument voulant qu'on ne pr&eacute;judicie pas les droits du donneur d'ordre.<sup><a href="#seventy6">76</a></sup> Un auteur ajoute &agrave; cela que



la reconnaissance de la fraude intellectuelle emp&ecirc;che la banque de payer le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire si elle a connaissance de la fraude, malgr&eacute; que les documents soient parfaitement conformes.<sup><a href="#seventy7">77</a></sup>



<p>



Dans l'arr&ecirc;t <cite>Platinum Communications Systems Inc. v. IMAX Corp.</cite>,<sup><a href="#seventy8">78</a></sup> la Banque de Nouvelle-&Eacute;cosse en appelait d'un jugement accordant une



injonction interlocutoire &agrave; la demanderesse. Elle fut d&eacute;bout&eacute;e en appel par la Cour d'appel de la Colombie-Britannique, celle-ci jugeant que le juge de premi&egrave;re instance avait eu raison d'accorder



l'injonction vu la fraude de la d&eacute;fenderesse IMAX Corp. En l'esp&egrave;ce, la fraude provenait de ce que les marchandises livr&eacute;es ne concordaient pas avec les &eacute;chantillons convenus entre les parties du contrat sous-jacent, lesdites marchandises se r&eacute;v&eacute;lant &ecirc;tre de &quot;worthless rubbish&quot;, de v&eacute;ritables d&eacute;chets. Ceci accompagn&eacute; du non respect d'une clause de non concurrence avait fait pencher la balance en faveur de la demanderesse. Cette d&eacute;cision est int&eacute;ressante car elle va dans le m&ecirc;me sens que l'arr&ecirc;t <cite>Angelica</cite> rendu deux ans auparavant, quoiqu'on n'y



fasse aucune r&eacute;f&eacute;rence expresse.<sup><a href="#seventy9">79</a></sup>



<p>



Au Qu&eacute;bec, quelques ann&eacute;es avant la d&eacute;cision <cite>Angelica</cite>, la Cour sup&eacute;rieure a rendu jugement dans une histoire d'appel abusif de garantie.<sup><a href="#eighty">80</a></sup> Dans cette cause, l'ex&eacute;cution d'un contrat de construction en Iran &eacute;tait devenue impossible d&ucirc; &agrave; la situation politique r&eacute;gnant dans ce pays &agrave; cette &eacute;poque. Le cocontractant iranien voulait alors mettre en jeu la garantie consentie par la



demanderesse, nonobstant les termes du contrat au sujet des cas de force majeure. La Cour avait reconnu qu'une fraude &eacute;manant du contrat de base donnait ouverture &agrave; une injonction.<sup><a href="#eighty1">81</a></sup>



<p>



Pour les Am&eacute;ricains, la question n'est pas d&eacute;finitivement tranch&eacute;e. Malgr&eacute; les d&eacute;cisions susmentionn&eacute;es ainsi que le paragraphe 5--114(2) du <cite>U.C.C.</cite>, il existe une certaine tendance ayant pour effet de restreindre la port&eacute;e de la fraude. Dans le paragraphe 5--114(2) datant de 1962,<sup><a href="#eighty2">82</a></sup> un certain courant s'&eacute;tait form&eacute; auparavant soutenant la th&egrave;se de la &quot;gross fraud test&quot;. Selon cette th&eacute;orie, la fraude &eacute;tait reconnue soit dans des documents falsifi&eacute;s, <i>i.e.</i>, la fraude mat&eacute;rielle telle qu'elle est reconnue actuellement, soit lorsque les documents mentionnaient que les marchandises avaient &eacute;t&eacute; envoy&eacute;es et qu'en r&eacute;alit&eacute;, rien du tout n'&eacute;tait en route vers le destinataire.<sup><a href="#eighty3">83</a></sup> Il semble que plusieurs juges r&eacute;calcitrants refusent toujours d'&eacute;largir la notion de fraude &agrave; celle reconnue par le <cite>U.C.C.</cite>, surtout depuis l'entr&eacute;e en vigueur du paragraphe 5--114(2).<sup><a href="#eighty4">84</a></sup> D'ailleurs, la



jurisprudence est majoritaire &agrave; l'appui de ce point de vue et m&ecirc;me depuis quelques ann&eacute;es, les juges am&eacute;ricains refusent toujours de reconna&icirc;tre la fraude dans la transaction commise par le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire.<sup><a href="#eighty5">85</a></sup> Une d&eacute;cision a m&ecirc;me interpr&eacute;t&eacute; les termes &quot;fraud in the transaction&quot; du paragraphe 5--114(2) comme signifiant la fraude dans la pr&eacute;sentation des documents requis et non dans l'op&eacute;ration



sous-jacente. Le juge se justifie en invoquant le principe d'autonomie de la lettre de cr&eacute;dit et le fait qu'il faille &eacute;viter de le &quot;d&eacute;consid&eacute;rer&quot;.<sup><a href="#eighty6">86</a></sup>



<p>



Une autre tendance a pour effet de ne permettre l'exception de fraude dans le contrat de base que dans des cas tr&egrave;s stricts. Un juge a &eacute;nonc&eacute; &agrave; ce sujet:



<blockquote>



&quot;... such an egregious nature as to vitiate the entire underlying transaction so that the legitimate purposes of the independence of the bank's obligation would no longer be served. It is generally thought to include an element of intentional misrepresentation in order to profit from another ... this fraud is and the statements therein, presented under the letter of credit. One court has gone so far as to say that only some defect in those documents would justify a bank's dishonor (Citations omitted).&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty7">87</a></sup>



</blockquote>



Seules quelques d&eacute;cisions reconnaissent ce droit au donneur d'ordre.<sup><a href="#eighty8">88</a></sup> Un juge a d'ailleurs mentionn&eacute; &agrave; ce sujet que &quot;the law of `fraud'



is not static and the courts have, over the years, adapted it to the changing nature of commercial transactions in our



society.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty9">89</a></sup> Selon nous, les d&eacute;cisions rendues depuis quelques ann&eacute;es &agrave; travers les &Eacute;tats-Unis semblent d&eacute;montrer le contraire. De nombreux juges paraissent vouer un culte aveugle &agrave; l'autonomie de la lettre de cr&eacute;dit, sans m&ecirc;me consid&eacute;rer les cas les plus flagrants de fraude prenant racine dans la transaction sous-jacente. Il faut bien s&ucirc;r se garder de trop &eacute;largir la notion de fraude pour ne pas d&eacute;naturaliser le cr&eacute;dit documentaire et lui enlever son efficacit&eacute;,<sup><a href="#ninety">90</a></sup> mais nous croyons que m&ecirc;me si la lettre de cr&eacute;dit doit au d&eacute;part favoriser le vendeur (b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire), elle n'a certainement pas &eacute;t&eacute; con&ccedil;ue dans le but de nuire d&eacute;lib&eacute;r&eacute;ment &agrave; l'acheteur (le donneur d'ordre). &Agrave; l'extr&ecirc;me, si l'on suivait le raisonnement de ces juges r&eacute;fractaires &agrave; la codification de l'arr&ecirc;t <cite>Sztejn v. J. Henry Schroder Banking Corporation et al.</cite>,<sup><a href="#ninety1">91</a></sup> le cr&eacute;dit documentaire ne deviendrait qu'une simple



garantie bancaire!<sup><a href="#ninety2">92</a></sup>



<p>



Les magistrats anglais se montrent un peu plus conservateurs que leurs coll&egrave;gues nord-am&eacute;ricains sur cette &eacute;pineuse question. On explique mal l'attitude r&eacute;cente des tribunaux britanniques



confront&eacute;s &agrave; une fraude intellectuelle, l'&eacute;tat actuel du droit anglais &eacute;tant d'ailleurs &agrave; l'effet de s'en tenir &agrave; la fraude mat&eacute;rielle. Ceux-ci se basent sur la d&eacute;cision <cite>United City Merchants v. Royal Bank of Canada</cite><sup><a href="#ninety3">93</a></sup> pour justifier leurs d&eacute;cisions. Dans cette cause, il s'agissait d'un recours contre une banque ayant pay&eacute; un



b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire non impliqu&eacute; dans une fraude dont l'auteur s'est r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute; &ecirc;tre un mandataire du transporteur maritime qui avait falsifi&eacute; le connaissement maritime.<sup><a href="#ninety4">94</a></sup> La Chambre des lords n'avait pas trait&eacute; de la fraude intellectuelle, s'en tenant au litige entre les parties. Les juristes canadiens et am&eacute;ricains n'ont pu trouver dans cette importante d&eacute;cision un simple <i>obiter dictum</i> en faveur de l'interpr&eacute;tation large de la fraude.<sup><a href="#ninety5">95</a></sup>



<p>



Cependant, sera-t-il possible de trouver dans l'arr&ecirc;t <cite>Deutsche Ruckversicherung AG v. Walbrook Insurance Co. Ltd. et al.</cite><sup><a href="#ninety6">96</a></sup> un renversement de ce courant de jurisprudence? On a refus&eacute; d'accorder une injonction car la preuve de la fraude dans le contrat de base ne pouvait &ecirc;tre &eacute;tablie, mais la Cour d'appel ajoute en <i>obiter dictum</i>:



<blockquote>



&quot;More generally, the claim to relief which Mr Bartlett advances would, if well-founded, be available in every case where a plaintiff challenged the right of a beneficiary under a letter of credit to payment under the underlying transaction. Such relief would clot what has been described as the lifeblood of international commerce as surely as an injunction restraining drawing on the credit.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety7">97</a></sup>



</blockquote>



Les tribunaux fran&ccedil;ais n'&eacute;tant pas li&eacute;s par la r&egrave;gle du <i>stare decisis</i>, on pourrait croire qu'ils sont plus flexibles quant &agrave; la possibilit&eacute; d'invoquer la fraude survenue dans le



contrat de base. Erreur! &Agrave; notre grande surprise, ceux-ci sont les plus restrictifs sur la question parmi les &Eacute;tats &eacute;tudi&eacute;s. La plupart des d&eacute;cisions r&eacute;centes affirment qu'on ne peut



invoquer la fraude dans le contrat de base pour obtenir l'annulation de la lettre de cr&eacute;dit.<sup><a href="#ninety8">98</a></sup>



<p>



3.1.4   <i>Fraude vs. simple conflit commercial</i><br>



Lorsque le litige se produit dans le contrat de base, les juges admettent en principe la possibilit&eacute; pour le donneur d'ordre qui subit un pr&eacute;judice d'invoquer l'exception de fraude. En pratique toutefois, le fardeau de prouver la fraude est tr&egrave;s dur &agrave; surmonter.<sup><a href="#ninety9">99</a></sup> Si la



fraude ne peut &ecirc;tre d&eacute;montr&eacute;e, il y a peut-&ecirc;tre un litige de moindre importance entre les parties. Il faut donc savoir nuancer lorsque des all&eacute;gations de fraude sont lanc&eacute;es envers un



b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire parfois sans scrupule car le geste pos&eacute; par  celui-ci, s'il n'est pas frauduleux, n'est peut-&ecirc;tre pas des plus honn&ecirc;tes.



<p>



Ce qui n'est pas class&eacute; comme &eacute;tant de la fraude se limite &agrave; un simple conflit commercial<sup><a href="#onehundred">100</a></sup>, d'o&ugrave; l'importance de bien cerner la



notion de fraude. 



<p>



3.2   D&Eacute;FINITION DE LA FRAUDE



<p>



L'analyse des diff&Eacute;rents crit&egrave;res se rattachant &agrave; la fraude nous permet d'en tirer quelques conclusions. Consid&eacute;rant les divergences existant toujours entre les pays au sujet de certains aspects de la fraude, la d&eacute;finition que nous proposons doit se limiter aux contextes canadien et qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois. Dans ce cas, nous avons vu que l'auteur de la fraude doit &ecirc;tre le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire de la lettre de cr&eacute;dit et non pas un tiers non impliqu&eacute; dans les relations entre les parties. Par cons&eacute;quent, si ce tiers est de bonne foi, la fraude ne pourra lui &ecirc;tre oppos&eacute;e. L'&eacute;tat du droit actuel admet non seulement la fraude touchant les documents transmis &agrave; la banque, mais la fraude qui &eacute;mane du contrat &agrave; la base des relations impliquant les parties. Il importe peu alors que les marchandises n'aient pas &eacute;t&eacute; envoy&eacute;es du tout ou qu'elles aient &eacute;t&eacute; remplac&eacute;es par d'autres de moindre qualit&eacute;, sous r&eacute;serve d'une preuve &agrave; cet effet.<sup><a href="#one01">101</a></sup>



<p>



Plusieurs auteurs et magistrats ont tent&eacute; de d&eacute;finir la fraude.<sup><a href="#one02">102</a></sup> Par exemple, M. Pomerleau a tent&eacute; une esquisse de d&eacute;finition de la



fraude,<sup><a href="#one03">103</a></sup> laquelle a &eacute;t&eacute; s&eacute;v&egrave;rement critiqu&eacute;e, avec raison croyons-nous, par Me B&eacute;langer.<sup><a href="#one04">104</a></sup> Ainsi que mentionn&eacute; ci-haut, la d&eacute;finition de la fraude se doit de nous permettre de distinguer celle-ci du simple litige commercial. La d&eacute;finition de la fraude de M. Pomerleau met l'accent plut&ocirc;t sur l'enrichissement sans cause du b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire, sans faire ressortir n&eacute;cessairement la notion de



fraude. Nous croyons qu'il est plus important d'insister sur le pr&eacute;judice subi par le donneur d'ordre, puisque celui-ci doit le d&eacute;montrer lors d'un recours tel une demande d'injonction interlocutoire.<sup><a href="#one05">105</a></sup>



<p>



Il serait plus opportun selon nous de d&eacute;finir la fraude comme suit: <i>tout acte commis d&eacute;lib&eacute;r&eacute;ment par le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire, directement ou indirectement, soit en modifiant les documents stipul&eacute;s dans l'accr&eacute;ditif ou soit en contrevenant &agrave; l'entente initiale conclue entre les parties, le tout ayant pour cons&eacute;quence de causer un pr&eacute;judice au donneur d'ordre &agrave; un point tel qu'un tribunal soit clairement convaincu que ce geste constitue une entrave &agrave; l'autonomie du cr&eacute;dit documentaire telle que reconnue par le droit du commerce international, lui permettant



ainsi d'annuler l'ordre de paiement exig&eacute; en vertu de la lettre de cr&eacute;dit.</i>



<p>



3.3   TENDANCES FUTURES



<p>



3.3.1   <i>Vers une uniformisation de l'admissibilit&eacute; de la fraude en tant qu'exception au principe d'autonomie</i><br>



Consid&eacute;rant les divergences relatives &agrave; certains crit&egrave;res de la fraude, peut-on esp&eacute;rer que les points de vue des diff&eacute;rents pays convergent &eacute;ventuellement vers un point commun?



La r&eacute;ponse &agrave; cette question d&eacute;pend en partie du fait que les tribunaux soient divis&eacute;s ou non sur les points en question.



<p>



Il existe une pol&eacute;mique concernant la possibilit&eacute; d'admettre la fraude &eacute;manant du contrat de base en tant qu'exception au principe d'autonomie du cr&eacute;dit documentaire. Les Anglais, conservateurs de nature, s'en tiennent &agrave; une interpr&eacute;tation stricte de la fraude, soit celle existant dans les documents et



non dans le contrat sous-jacent. Puisque leur argument tient au fait que l'on doit demeurer dans la lign&eacute;e de l'arr&ecirc;t <cite>United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd. v. Royal Bank of Canada</cite>,<sup><a href="#one06">106</a></sup> il faut se rappeler que le litige dans cette derni&egrave;re cause ne portait pas sur un probl&egrave;me de fraude intellectuelle, mais sur une fraude mat&eacute;rielle. Consid&eacute;rant les arguments invoqu&eacute;s par le juge Le Dain dans <cite>Angelica</cite> &agrave; l'effet qu'il est parfois difficile de s&eacute;parer les deux types de fraude et qu'il ne faut pas pr&eacute;judicier aux droits du donneur d'ordre<sup><a href="#one07">107</a></sup>, il est bien surprenant qu'un magistrat anglais faisant face &agrave; un probl&egrave;me de fraude intellectuelle ne se soit pas pench&eacute; sur cet argument de poids pour se &quot;distinguer&quot; de ses coll&egrave;gues de la Chambre des lords. Nous croyons que dans un jour peut-&ecirc;tre pas si lointain le vent tournera quelque part au Royaume-Uni et les juristes anglais ajusteront alors leurs pendules &agrave; l'heure, le tout dans l'esprit de protection des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts du donneur d'ordre. 



<p>



Concernant leurs cousins am&eacute;ricains, il est difficile de comprendre sur quel fondement juridique, sous r&eacute;serve de quelques d&eacute;cisions existant avant l'arriv&eacute;e du paragraphe 5--114(2) du



<cite>U.C.C.</cite>,<sup><a href="#one08">108</a></sup> se basent les d&eacute;cisions rendues apr&egrave;s l'entr&eacute;e en vigueur de cette disposition. Nous croyons que ce n'est pas avant quelques ann&eacute;es que les juges am&eacute;ricains opteront majoritairement pour le point de vue du juge Le Dain.



<p>



Quant aux Fran&ccedil;ais, nous sommes d'avis que si le pr&eacute;sent est garant de l'avenir, les donneurs d'ordre devront s'armer de beaucoup de patience pour prouver qu'il existe une fraude dans le contrat de base.



<p>



Les autres &eacute;l&eacute;ments de la fraude ne posent pas de difficult&eacute;s en soi. Il est g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement reconnu parmi les &eacute;tats &eacute;tudi&eacute;s que l'auteur de la fraude doit se limiter au b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire, m&ecirc;me dans le cas o&ugrave; celui-ci n'a qu'une simple connaissance de la fraude commise. De plus, il est reconnu que cette fraude est inopposable au d&eacute;tenteur r&eacute;gulier, sauf en France.



<p>



En cons&eacute;quence, nous pouvons conclure que l'on voit poindre &agrave; l'horizon une uniformisation des crit&egrave;res de la fraude, que se soit au niveau de l'auteur, de l'opposabilit&eacute; ou des cat&eacute;gories



de fraude, mais celle-ci ne se fera pas &agrave; court terme d&ucirc; &agrave; l'opposition farouche de quelques-uns.



<p>



3.3.2   <i>Influence de l'&Eacute;.D.I. sur la fraude</i><br>



L'arriv&eacute;e de l'informatique aura pour cons&eacute;quence de chambarder consid&eacute;rablement les us et coutumes des commer&ccedil;ants internationaux. Comme nous l'avons soulign&eacute; auparavant,<sup><a href="#one09">109</a></sup> l'impact se fera sentir, comme c'est d&eacute;j&agrave; le cas actuellement, sur les documents stipul&eacute;s &agrave; l'accr&eacute;ditif. Que ceux-ci soient n&eacute;gociables ou non, les nouveaux documents informatis&eacute;s ne sont pas &agrave; l'abri des fraudeurs, loin de l&agrave;! L&oacute;n peut penser que cette nouvelle fraude touchera surtout la fraude mat&eacute;rielle, la fraude intellectuelle ne visant pas toujours les documents repr&eacute;sentant les marchandises, mais les marchandises elles-m&ecirc;mes. L'informatisation des documents n&eacute;gociables, comme par exemple le connaissement maritime, pose un probl&egrave;me majeur pour des raisons d'identification. Selon Caprioli, &quot;La solution d'un v&eacute;ritable connaissement maritime &eacute;lectronique passe par la mise en place d'un proc&eacute;d&eacute; fiable d'authentification des signatures accompagn&eacute; d'une reconnaissance l&eacute;gale de ce type de



proc&eacute;d&eacute;.&quot;<sup><a href="#one10">110</a></sup>



<p>



Le probl&egrave;me est double: non seulement il faut trouver une solution &agrave; l'informatisation des documents n&eacute;gociables, mais encore faut-il que cette solution nous assure que le moyen d'authentification des documents soit fiable et s&eacute;curitaire. Comme le soulignent deux auteurs:



<blockquote>



&quot;Comment s'assurer que l'exp&eacute;diteur d'un message est bien celui qu'il pr&eacute;tend &ecirc;tre? Les risques (...) d'erreurs existent indubitablement et, si leur intensit&eacute; n'est pas en r&eacute;alit&eacute; sup&eacute;rieure &agrave; celle rencontr&eacute;e dans l'usage du papier, la d&eacute;mat&eacute;rialisation du support documentaire cr&eacute;e des inqui&eacute;tudes nouvelles: elle impose des nouvelles solutions &eacute;galement.&quot;<sup><a href="#one11">111</a></sup>



</blockquote>



Donc un des probl&egrave;mes majeurs de l'informatisation des documents concerne la preuve de leur authenticit&eacute;, <i>i.e.</i>, l'identification de leurs auteurs.<sup><a href="#one12">112</a></sup> Les <cite>R.U.U.</cite> n'exigent pas sp&eacute;cifiquement que la signature d'un document soit manuscrite,



contrairement &agrave; l'article 5--114 du <cite>U.C.C.</cite><sup><a href="#one13">113</a></sup>



<p>



Le Projet de la C.N.U.D.C.I. (1993)<sup><a href="#one14">114</a></sup> vise &agrave; nous aider &agrave; solutionner ce probl&egrave;me. Le chapitre II est particuli&egrave;rement pertinent &agrave; cet &eacute;gard. Alors que l'article 6 tente de d&eacute;finir un &quot;&eacute;crit&quot;, l'article 7 &eacute;tablit les bases pour l'&eacute;quivalent de ce que constitue une &quot;signature&quot;. Le paragraphe 1 vise l'&eacute;tablissement d'un mode d'identification de l'exp&eacute;diteur du message, donc la reconnaissance de la signature, ainsi qu'un syst&egrave;me de s&eacute;curit&eacute;, le tout con&ccedil;cu selon &quot;une m&eacute;thode commercialement raisonnable.&quot; Le paragraphe 2 mentionne quelques facteurs pour nous aider &agrave; y parvenir, comme par exemple les activit&eacute;s commerciales des parties et tout ce qui gravite autour ainsi que des proc&eacute;dures d'identification et d'autorisation, comme par exemple, l'utilisation d'un code secret, d'un lecteur de cartes, d'un syst&egrave;me de t&eacute;l&eacute;transmission.<sup><a href =  #one15">115</a></sup> On a essay&eacute; de d&eacute;finir ce qu'est un &quot;original&quot; &agrave; l'article 8, comme &eacute;tant, selon la &quot;Variante C&quot;, une sortie d'imprimante pr&eacute;sentant une fiabilit&eacute; de l'identit&eacute; de l'auteur et du contenu du message, le tout selon la valeur probante tel que d&eacute;termin&eacute;e &agrave; l'article 9.



<p>



Cette derni&egrave;re disposition rejoint d'ailleurs les articles 2837 et suivants du <cite>Code civil du Qu&eacute;bec</cite>, en vigueur depuis plus d'un an d&eacute;j&agrave; et innovateur en mati&egrave;re de proc&eacute;dure civile, en ce sens qu'on pr&eacute;voit une pr&eacute;somption de validit&eacute; pour les documents informatis&eacute;s, en autant que l'acte soit intelligible et qu'il existe des garanties suffisamment s&eacute;rieuses pour s'y fier. 



<p>



Quoique ces dispositions apportent des &eacute;l&eacute;ments de solutions, le risque de fraude existe encore. L'uniformisation de l'utilisation d'E.D.I.F.A.C.T.<sup><a href="#one16">116</a></sup> en mati&egrave;re de cr&eacute;dit documentaire, constitue un autre pas vers la recherche de solutions pour contrer la fraude du



cr&eacute;dit &eacute;lectronique. Celui-ci consiste en &quot;un langage normalis&eacute; &agrave; l'&eacute;chelle internationale pour le transfert d'informations structur&eacute;es entre ordinateurs et utilisable dans le domaine de l'administration, du commerce (entendu au sens large) et du transport.&quot;<sup><a href="#one17">117</a></sup> Selon Caprioli,<sup><a href="#one18">118</a></sup> il ne fait aucun doute que l'application d'E.D.I.F.A.C.T. au cr&eacute;dit documentaire apporte de l'eau au moulin. Ce syst&egrave;me comporte l'avantage de &quot;normaliser les messages du cr&eacute;dit documentaire au moyen de l'automatisation de ce qui peut &ecirc;tre fait.&quot;<sup><a href="#one19">119</a></sup> De m&ecirc;me, toujours selon cet auteur, une seconde cons&eacute;quence a trait &agrave; ce que l'on verra probablement une &eacute;volution des techniques au niveau de la r&eacute;alisation du cr&eacute;dit documentaire, ce qui est loin d'&ecirc;tre n&eacute;gligeable. 



<p>



Comme l'a mentionn&eacute; un autre auteur, &quot;In any case, since the present system is by no means proof against fraud, the evidence suggests that commercial men are prepared to accept a certain level of fraud in order to effect speedier and less costly transactions.&quot;<sup><a href="#one20">120</a></sup> Autrement dit, le crime est l&agrave; pour y demeurer et, &agrave; la limite, m&ecirc;me si l'utilisation de l'informatique nous permet d'am&eacute;liorer les m&eacute;thodes pour le contrer, on ne pourra malheureusement l'&eacute;liminer compl&egrave;tement. 



<p>



3.4   RECOURS



<p>



Le donneur d'ordre se croyant victime d'une fraude pourra bien s&ucirc;r intenter des recours soit contre sa banque, la banque &eacute;mettrice, soit contre le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire, ou tout autre auteur de la fraude, dans le cas o&ugrave; celle-ci est le fait d'un tiers. La nature du recours intent&eacute; d&eacute;pendra selon que la banque



&eacute;mettrice a effectu&eacute; le paiement ou non. Le cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant, le donneur d'ordre devra se pr&eacute;valoir de mesures provisionnelles telles qu'un recours en injonction ou une saisie avant jugement alors



qu'un recours en dommages conviendra si l'ordre de paiement a &eacute;t&eacute; ex&eacute;cut&eacute;.



<p>



3.4.1   <i>Recours avant paiement</i><br>



Nous avons d&eacute;j&agrave; constat&eacute; que les tribunaux ont tendance &agrave; interpr&eacute;ter restrictivement la non conformit&eacute; des documents, ne permettant le paiement que lorsque de simples erreurs



minimes surviennent. Il en est de m&ecirc;me concernant la fraude. Il s'agit d'une preuve difficile &agrave; &eacute;tablir, les juges &eacute;tant r&eacute;ticents &agrave; aller &agrave; l'encontre de la bonne marche du cr&eacute;dit documentaire. 



<p>



D'ailleurs, dans <cite>Barzelex Inc. c. M.E.C.S. International Canada Inc.</cite>,<sup><a href="#one21">121</a></sup> le juge Downs mentionnait avec raison &agrave; ce sujet: &quot;Le tribunal reconna&icrci;t qu'il y a toujours lieu de favoriser et de faciliter l'ex&eacute;cution de transactions internationales. C'est d'ailleurs dans cet esprit que la Chambre de commerce internationale doit avoir adopt&eacute; ses r&egrave;gles et `usances' uniformes aux cr&eacute;dits documentaires.&quot;  Nonobstant le fait que cette cause ait &eacute;t&eacute; renvers&eacute;e par la Cour d'appel, ces commentaires demeurent tout de m&ecirc;me judicieux. Il existe quand m&ecirc;me des cas o&ugrave; le donneur d'ordre devra recourir &agrave; des mesures



provisoires dans l'hypoth&egrave;se o&ugrave; la banque ne veut pas entendre ses dol&eacute;ances relatives &agrave; ses all&eacute;gations de fraude.



<p>



3.4.1.1   <i>Notification &agrave; la banque &eacute;mettrice</i><br>



Lorsque le donneur d'ordre a connaissance d'une fraude affectant le cr&eacute;dit documentaire auquel il est parti, il doit agir avec diligence et en avertir la banque sans d&eacute;lai. Le cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant, la banque peut refuser de payer le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire, rien dans les <cite>R.U.U.</cite> ne l'obligeant &agrave; le faire. Cette situation s'est produite dans une cause de la Saskatchewan datant de quelques ann&eacute;es.<sup><a href="#one22">122</a></sup> Sur un appel du donneur d'ordre, la banque avait refus&eacute; de payer le



b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire et celui-ci avait pr&eacute;sent&eacute; une requ&ecirc;te en jugement d&eacute;claratoire pour que son droit au paiement lui soit reconnu. Ayant prouv&eacute; la fraude, la banque avait fait rejeter la requ&ecirc;te de l'appelant. La Cour s'est dite d'accord avec les propos de son coll&egrave;gue de la Colombie-Britanique dans la cause <cite>Henderson v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</cite><sup><a href="#one23">123</a></sup> pour mentionner que: 



<blockquote>



&quot;... where the seller's fraud has been called to the bank's attention before the drafts and documents have been presented for payment, the principle of independence of the bank's obligation under the letter of credit should not be extended to protect the unscrupulous seller.&quot;<sup><a href="#one24">124</a></sup>



</blockquote>



Tel que soulev&eacute; au paragraphe pr&eacute;c&eacute;dent, dans le cas o&ugrave; la banque refuse de croire le donneur d'ordre et d&eacute;cide de payer le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire, alors le donneur d'ordre devra intenter une injonction ou une saisie avant jugement, selon son &eacute;tat d'origine.



<p>



3.4.1.2   <i>Injonction</i><br>



Lorsque la fraude est d&eacute;couverte avant que la banque &eacute;mettrice fasse parvenir un ordre de paiement au b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire ou accepte d'ex&eacute;cuter cet ordre, l'injonction est le recours habituellement utilis&eacute; par le donneur d'ordre. Le donneur d'ordre intentera une action en injonction permanente accompagn&eacute;e d'une injonction interlocutoire afin de prot&eacute;ger ses droits durant l'instance principale. L'article 752 <cite>C.p.c.</cite><sup><a href="#one25">125</a></sup> et la <cite>Common Law</cite><sup><a href="#one26">126</a></sup> &eacute;tablissent les crit&egrave;res d'une demande d'injonction, &agrave; savoir que le requ&eacute;rant doit d&eacute;montrer une apparence de droit ainsi que la cons&eacute;quence du refus de l'injonction, soit qu'un pr&eacute;judice s&eacute;rieux ou irr&eacute;parable peut lui &ecirc;tre caus&eacute;, ou que peut survenir un &eacute;tat de fait ou de droit de nature &agrave; rendre le jugement final inefficace. Dans le doute, le juge tiendra compte de la balance des inconv&eacute;nients.<sup><a href="#one27">127</a></sup>



<p>



En pratique toutefois, il importe de savoir selon quel fardeau de preuve la fraude doit &ecirc;tre &eacute;tablie afin de tenir le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire responsable de celle-ci. Doit-on consid&eacute;rer de simples all&eacute;gations, la balance des probabilit&eacute;s ou une preuve hors de tout doute raisonnable, consid&eacute;rant que la fraude est un acte criminel en vertu de l'article 397 du <cite>C.Cr.</cite>?<sup><a href="#one28">128</a></sup> Lorsque la fraude est d&eacute;montr&eacute;e, les tribunaux accorderont le recours souhait&eacute; s'ils consid&egrave;rent le cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant que le donneur d'ordre a satisfait aux crit&egrave;res ci-haut mentionn&eacute;s.<sup><a href="#one29">129</a></sup>



<p>



Au Qu&eacute;bec et au Canada, la question de l'intensit&eacute; du fardeau impos&eacute; au donneur d'ordre all&eacute;guant une fraude est d&eacute;finitivement tranch&eacute;e, pour plusieurs ann&eacute;es du moins, depuis l'arr&ecirc;t <cite>Angelica</cite>. Dans cette cause, quoique la banque &eacute;mettrice avait d&eacute;j&agrave; effectu&eacute; le paiement au b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire, le juge Le Dain s'est tout de m&ecirc;me prononc&eacute; concernant le fardeau n&eacute;cessaire dans ce cas. &quot;Une solide preuve



<i>prima facie</i> de fraude semble constituer un crit&egrave;re satisfaisant dans le cas d'une demande d'injonction interlocutoire.&quot;<sup><a href="#one30</a></sup> Malgr&eacute; que cette opinion ne soit qu'un <i>obiter dictum</i>, il convient d'admettre que la jurisprudence subs&eacute;quente s'en est tenu &agrave; la m&ecirc;me ligne de conduite.<sup><a href="#one31">131</a></sup>



<p>



Avant que cette d&eacute;cision ne soit rendue, un tribunal ontarien avait rendu jugement en ce sens, jugeant qu'une solide preuve <i>prima facie</i> &eacute;tait plus appropri&eacute;e que le test selon une preuve claire de fraude (&quot;clear fraud&quot;) &eacute;nonc&eacute; dans l'arr&ecirc;t de principe <cite>Edward Owen Engineering Ltd. v. Barclays Bank International Ltd</cite>.<sup><a href="#one32">132</a></sup> Il faut croire que la Cour avait vu juste, car le plus haut tribunal canadien a confirm&eacute; ce point de vue quelques ann&eacute;es plus tard.



<p>



La tendance r&eacute;cente des tribunaux anglais est &agrave; l'effet que ceux-ci se sont &eacute;galement align&eacute;s sur la fameuse d&eacute;cision <cite>Edward Owen Engineering Ltd. v. Barclays Bank International Ltd.</cite>.<sup><a href="#one33">133</a></sup> Dans cette d&eacute;cision, on a suivi la d&eacute;cision <cite>R.D. Hartbottle (Mercantile) Ltd. v. National Westminster Bank Ltd et al.</cite><sup><a href="#one34">134</a></sup> et exig&eacute; une preuve claire de la fraude. En pratique, il semble &ecirc;tre



extr&ecirc;mement difficile d'obtenir une injonction puisque, si &agrave; la limite le donneur d'ordre peut d&eacute;montrer la fraude, il lui est cependant difficile de d&eacute;montrer que son pr&eacute;judice est



irr&eacute;parable ou que la balance des inconv&eacute;nients lui est favorable.<sup><a href="#one35">135</a></sup> Selon la tr&egrave;s r&eacute;cente d&eacute;cision <cite>Deutsche Ruckversicherung AG v. Walbrook Insurance Co. Ltd. et al.</cite>,<sup><a href="#one36">136</a></sup> il n'existe pas de cas rapport&eacute;s d'injonctions ayant &eacute;t&eacute; accord&eacute;es dans le cas de fraude. 



<p>



Du c&ocirc;t&eacute; am&eacute;ricain, les tribunaux se montrent-ils un peu plus cl&eacute;ments quand il s'agit d'accorder des injonctions interlocutoires et permanentes? Nous avons d&eacute;j&agrave; discut&eacute; de



quelques d&eacute;cisions am&eacute;ricaines &agrave; la section 3.1.3.2 qui d&eacute;montraient une attitude tr&egrave;s restrictive quant &agrave; l'admission de la fraude commise dans le contrat de base. La position des



tribunaux &agrave; ce niveau rend la situation du donneur d'ordre am&eacute;ricain d&eacute;sirant &eacute;viter qu'un b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire s'enrichisse frauduleusement &agrave; ses d&eacute;pens tout aussi ardue qu'en Angleterre. L'&eacute;minent auteur John F. Dolan se dit d'accord pour emp&ecirc;cher de rendre l'exception de fraude trop facile &agrave; utiliser. Il mentionne d'ailleurs &agrave; ce sujet: 



<blockquote>



&quot;The trouble is that, by requesting the court to consider the issue, the account party's charge of fraud interrupts the credit transaction and destroys many of the credit's attractive commercial features. The credit is designed to achieve, above all, celerity and certainty, the fraud inquiry diminishes both.&quot;<sup><a href="#one37">137</a></sup>



</blockquote>



Son point de vue rejoint deux d&eacute;cisions importantes qui concluent au refus de l'injonction parce que la fraude &eacute;mane du contrat de base.<sup><a href="#one38">138</a></sup> Ce point de vue est tr&egrave;s discutable, selon nous pour les m&ecirc;mes raisons exprim&eacute;es &agrave; la section 3.1.3.2. Ce qui est



plus acceptable, par contre, c'est de consid&eacute;rer que le crit&egrave;re de la solide preuve <i>prima facie</i> soit celui sur lequel les tribunaux am&eacute;ricains doivent se fier lorsqu'ils font face &agrave; une demande d'injonction. Il termine en pr&eacute;cisant que ce fardeau est tout de m&ecirc;me l&eacute;g&egrave;rement plus &eacute;lev&eacute; en Angleterre qu'aux &Eacute;tats-Unis.<sup><a href="#one39">139</a></sup>



<p>



De nombreux juges am&eacute;ricains optent effectivement pour un degr&eacute; de fraude relativement imposant sur les &eacute;paules du donneur d'ordre. Par exemple, dans deux d&eacute;cisions datant de quelques  ann&eacute;es, on a choisi un degr&eacute; de preuve exigeant une d&eacute;monstration claire de la situation de fraude.<sup><a href="#one40">140</a></sup> La preuve du pr&eacute;judice irr&eacute;parable est encore plus difficile &agrave; d&eacute;montrer que celle de la fraude.<sup><a href="#one41">141</a></sup> Nous comprenons qu'au bout du compte, l'injonction interlocutoire est &eacute;galement tr&egrave;s difficile &agrave; obtenir aux &Eacute;tats-Unis.



<p>



L'injonction n'est pas une mesure utilis&eacute;e pas les Fran&ccedil;ais pour contrer la fraude du b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire et les d&eacute;cisions consult&eacute;es d&eacute;notent plut&ocirc;t une tendance des donneurs d'ordre &agrave; demander une saisie-arr&ecirc;t, comme nous le verrons &agrave; la section



suivante. 



<p>



Au niveau d'une demande d'injonction permanente, la position des tribunaux est plus s&eacute;v&egrave;re. Dans la r&eacute;cente d&eacute;cision <cite>Bonnie Sportswear (1978) Ltd. v. International Trading Co.</cite>,<sup><a href="#one42">142</a></sup> la Cour sup&eacute;rieure mentionne au d&eacute;part que le fardeau de la preuve repose sur les &eacute;paules de celui qui invoque la fraude.<sup><a href="#one43">143</a></sup> Apr&egrave;s une &eacute;tude de la question de l'intensit&eacute; du fardeau, la



Cour ajoute d'une part que de simples all&eacute;gations de fraude ou m&ecirc;me la possibilit&eacute; d'une fraude ne sont pas suffisantes en soi pour justifier l'intervention du tribunal et d'autre part, que la fraude doit &ecirc;tre &eacute;tablie clairement.<sup><a href="#one44">144</a></sup> Il s'agit d'une preuve dont l'exigence est sensiblement plus &eacute;lev&eacute;e. L'injonction permanente ayant &eacute;t&eacute; accord&eacute;e, elle a pour cons&eacute;quence d'annuler la lettre de cr&eacute;dit.<sup><a href="#one45">145</a></sup>



<p>



3.4.1.3   <i>Saisie avant jugement</i><br>



Au Qu&eacute;bec, la d&eacute;cision de principe concernant la possibilit&eacute; de demander une saisie avant jugement est sans contredit <cite>Paris Sportswear Ltd. c. Lanifico Itlam.</cite><sup><a href="#one46">146</a></sup> Il s'agissait en l'esp&egrave;ce d'une demande de la part du donneur d'ordre de saisir avant jugement les fonds d&eacute;tenus par la banque &eacute;mettrice pour la raison que le d&eacute;fendeur-appelant ne s'est pas conform&eacute; aux conditions du contrat de base conclu entre les parties. La Cour d'appel reconna&icirc;t qu'en cas de fraude du b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire d'un cr&eacute;dit documentaire, l'injonction est le recours habituellement utilis&eacute;,<sup><a href="#one47">147</a></sup> mais que la saisie avant jugement, &eacute;galement appel&eacute;e saisie-arr&ecirc;t dans les circonstances, procurera le m&ecirc;me effet, soit de retenir les fonds temporairement tant qu'un tribunal ne se sera pas prononc&eacute; sur le fond du litige et d&eacute;cid&eacute; d'annuler la lettre de cr&eacute;dit.<sup><a href="#one48">148</a></sup> La Cour abonde donc dans le m&ecirc;me sens que la doctrine qu&eacute;b&eacute;coise<sup><a href="#one49">149</a></sup> et renverse donc sa position &eacute;tablie plusieurs ann&eacute;es plus



t&ocrci;t.<sup><a href="#one50">150</a></sup> La Cour sup&eacute;rieure a r&eacute;it&eacute;r&eacute; quelques ann&eacute;es plus tard que &quot;la saisie avant jugement est un recours tout aussi appropri&eacute; que



l'injonction.&quot; La Cour faisait face par contre &agrave; une demande d'injonction, et non de saisie avant jugement.<sup><a href="#one51">151</a></sup>



<p>



Autant l'injonction est difficile &agrave; obtenir en Angleterre, autant il en est de m&ecirc;me pour l'obtention d'une saisie-arr&ecirc;t en France. Tout d'abord, la fraude est tr&egrave;s difficile &agrave; mettre en preuve devant un tribunal fran&ccedil;ais, certains juges allant m&ecirc;me jusqu'&agrave; exiger comme preuve que la fraude soit monumentale.<sup><a href="#one52">152</a></sup>



<p>



La Cour de cassation a rendu un jugement il y a quelques ann&eacute;es d&eacute;j&agrave; &agrave; l'effet que la pratique de la saisie-arr&ecirc;t est contraire &agrave; la rigidit&eacute; de l'irr&eacute;vocabilit&eacute; du cr&eacute;dit documentaire,<sup><a href="#one53">153</a></sup> jugement qui fut confirm&eacute; quelques ann&eacute;es plus tard par la m&ecirc;me Cour.<sup><a href="#one54">154</a></sup> Quelques auteurs ouvrent la porte cependant &agrave; la possibilit&eacute; pour le donneur d'ordre de saisir avant jugement les



fonds d&eacute;tenus par la banque dans le cas d'une fraude commise par le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire d'un cr&eacute;dit documentaire irr&eacute;vocable.<sup><a href="#one55">155</a></sup> &Agrave; notre



connaissance, une seule d&eacute;cision rendue r&eacute;cemment a reconnu au donneur d'ordre le droit d'obtenir la saisie-arr&ecirc;t demand&eacute;e.<sup><a href="#one56">156</a></sup> La difficult&eacute; pour le donneur d'ordre d'obtenir une saisie-arr&ecirc;t provient du fait que le droit fran&ccedil;ais consid&egrave;re en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral que celui-ci ne peut all&eacute;guer une cr&eacute;ance &eacute;manant du contrat de base au soutien de sa demande; il ne peut m&ecirc;me pas l'all&eacute;guer si elle provient d'une cause &eacute;trang&egrave;re au contrat de base.<sup><a href="#one57">157</a></sup>



<p>



Tr&egrave;s rares sont les d&eacute;cisions anglaises concernant les demandes de saisie avant jugement, puisque celle-ci y est inconnue.<sup><a href="#one58">158</a></sup> Dans <cite>Power Curber International Ltd. v. National Bank of Kuwait</cite>,<sup><a href="#one59">159</a></sup> l'acheteur demandait qu'une &quot;provisional attachment&quot; soit accord&eacute;e pour saisir des sommes dues par le vendeur.<sup><a href="#one60">160</a></sup> La Cour d'appel a refus&eacute; la demande pour le motif de la pr&eacute;servation de l'importance des lettres de cr&eacute;dit dans le commerce international.<sup><a href="#one61">161</a></sup> En revanche, certains juristes pr&eacute;f&eacute;reront proc&eacute;der au moyen d'une injonction <cite>Mareva</cite> (<cite>Mareva Injonction</cite>).<sup><a href="#one62">162</a></sup> Selon  M. Pomerleau, cette injonction &eacute;quivaut plus ou moins &agrave; notre saisie avant jugement.<sup><a href="#one63">163</a></sup> Celle-ci est une cr&eacute;ation typiquement anglaise permettant au requ&eacute;rant de demander &agrave; la Cour d'emp&ecirc;cher que l'intim&eacute; ne



transf&egrave;re ses avoirs &agrave; l'ext&eacute;rieur de la juridiction concern&eacute;e lorsqu'une fraude de sa part est invoqu&eacute;e. L'avantage de cette injonction est qu'elle ne concerne que les parties au contrat de base et non le cr&eacute;dit documentaire, donc la preuve de la fraude peut sembler plus facile &agrave; d&eacute;montrer. Cel&agrave; ne para&icirc;t pas &ecirc;tre le cas, car cette injonction est &eacute;galement



tr&egrave;s difficile &agrave; obtenir,<sup><a href="#one64">164</a></sup> la preuve de la fraude



devant toujours &ecirc;tre prouv&eacute;e. Elle est &eacute;galement accord&eacute;e seulement lorsque le cr&eacute;dit est payable dans la juridiction de l'ordonnance.



<p>



Quoique la saisie avant jugement ne soit pas connue des pays de <cite>Common Law</cite>, elle fut utilis&eacute;e aux &Eacute;tats-Unis sous le vocable de &quot;attachment&quot; ou &quot;garnishment&quot;.<sup><a href="#one65">165</a></sup> On exige de celle-ci qu'elle soit intent&eacute;e avant que la banque l&egrave;ve les documents pour &ecirc;tre valide.<sup><a href="#one66">166</a></sup>



<p>



3.4.2  <i>Recours apr&egrave;s paiement</i><br>



Lorsque la banque &eacute;mettrice a d&eacute;j&agrave; pay&eacute; ou accept&eacute; de payer le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire, le donneur d'ordre peut dans certains cas sp&eacute;cifiques, refuser &agrave; bon droit de payer la banque, consid&eacute;rant la relation contractuelle existant entre eux. S'il est impossible pour le donneur d'ordre de se pr&eacute;valoir de ce recours, il devra s'en remettre en dernier essor &agrave; une poursuite envers le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire. Cependant, un tel recours est parfois plus th&eacute;orique que pratique ...



<p>



3.4.2.1   <i>Recours contre la banque &eacute;mettrice</i><br>



Les <cite>R.U.U.</cite> imposent plusieurs obligations aux banques, dont celles de ne pas consid&eacute;rer les



marchandises,<sup><a href="#one67">167</a></sup> d'examiner les documents avec un soin raisonnable et de payer lorsqu'il y a concordance des documents;<sup><a href="#one68">168</a></sup> elles n'assument aucune



obligation pour des documents frauduleux.<sup><a href="#one69">169</a></sup> Si la banque manque &agrave; ses obligations, elle est susceptible d'encourir sa responsabilit&eacute; vis-&agrave;-vis du donneur



d'ordre. L'arr&ecirc;t <cite>Angelica</cite> est l'exemple classique repr&eacute;sentant cette situation. On se rappelle que le donneur d'ordre, <cite>Angelica</cite>, poursuivait la banque &eacute;mettrice qui avait



pay&eacute; le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire. Nonobstant les avertissements pr&eacute;tendument fond&eacute;s du donneur d'ordre, la Cour a admis la possibilit&eacute; d'un tel recours en autant que &quot;la fraude du



b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire ait &eacute;t&eacute; port&eacute;e suffisamment &agrave; la connaissance de la banque avant le paiement de la traite.&quot;<sup><a href="#one70">170</a></sup> Malgr&eacute; sa simplicit&eacute; apparente, cette r&egrave;gle signifie que le donneur d'ordre a le fardeau de faire cette preuve. En



l'esp&egrave;ce, il a &eacute;t&eacute; mis en preuve que la banque avait eu connaissance de la contrefa&ccedil;on d'une des deux factures en litige, mais non de celle dont on all&eacute;guait la fraude. Cette preuve n'ayant



jamais &eacute;t&eacute; faite malgr&eacute; que la banque avait &eacute;t&eacute; inform&eacute;e de la contrefa&ccedil;on touchant la premi&egrave;re facture, le recours bas&eacute; sur la fraude a &eacute;t&eacute; rejet&eacute;. Encore une fois, la Cour supr&ecirc;me a repris les principes de droit existant en Angleterre et



&eacute;nonc&eacute;s dans les quelques causes c&eacute;l&egrave;bres d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;tudi&eacute;es &agrave; la section 3.4.1.2 &agrave; l'effet que la banque doit avoir connaissance de la fraude pour que celle-ci lui soit opposable.<sup><a href="#one71">171</a></sup>



<p>



Si la banque veut opposer une clause exon&eacute;ratoire au donneur d'ordre, la Cour supr&ecirc;me mentionne que celle-ci doit &ecirc;tre tr&egrave;s claire et ne pas porter &agrave; confusion. La Cour ajoute en <i>obiter dictum</i> qu'elle est d'accord pour affirmer qu'une telle clause ne peut emp&ecirc;cher la banque d'honorer la traite dans le cas o&ugrave; celle-ci a connaissance de la fraude.<sup><a href="#one72">172</a></sup>



<p>



Comme pour le cas du recours avant paiement, les d&eacute;cisions rendues r&eacute;cemment, tant au Qu&eacute;bec,<sup><a href="#one73">173</a></sup> au Canada<sup><a href="#one74">174</a></sup> qu'en Angleterre<sup><a href="#one75">175</a></sup> demeurent dans le m&ecirc;me esprit que l'arr&ecirc;t <cite>Angelica</cite> et sont tr&egrave;s timides &agrave; l'id&eacute;e de tenir une banque responsable, sans une preuve que celle-ci avait eu connaissance de la fraude lors du paiement ou de l'acceptation. Les Am&eacute;ricains abondent &eacute;galement dans le m&ecirc;me sens.<sup><a href="#one76">176</a></sup> D'ailleurs, le paragraphe 5--109(1) du <cite>U.C.C.</cite><sup><a href="#one77">177</a></sup> impose une obligation de bonne foi &agrave; la banque, que les tribunaux s'empresseront de sanctionner au cas o&ugrave; elle serait viol&eacute;e.<sup><a href="#one78">178</a></sup> Les tribunaux n'ont pas eu l'occasion de se prononcer tr&egrave;s souvent sur la question. L'&eacute;tat du droit fran&ccedil;ais est &agrave; l'effet que la banque engage sa responsabilit&eacute; lorsqu'elle paie un b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire, alors qu'une fraude manifeste aurait d&ucirc; l'en emp&ecirc;cher.<sup><a href="#one79">179</a></sup> Cons&eacute;quemment, un donneur d'ordre d&eacute;couvrant la fraude post&eacute;rieurement au paiement par la banque se verrait offrir la possibilit&eacute; d'un recours en dommages contre celle-ci.



<p>



3.4.2.2  <i>Recours contre le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire</i><br>



Dans l'&eacute;ventualit&eacute; o&ugrave; le donneur d'ordre ne peut prouver que la banque ait eu connaissance de la fraude lors du paiement au b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire, le dernier recours qui lui soit ouvert est un recours en dommages-int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts contre son cocontractant fond&eacute; sur la base du contrat initial conclu entre eux. Si les deux parties proviennent du m&ecirc;me &Eacute;tat, la situation n'est pas catastrophique, sous r&eacute;serve bien s&ucirc;r que le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire soit solvable. Puisque nous sommes dans le domaine du commerce international, les r&egrave;gles du jeu sont plus complexes. Si aucune clause d'arbitrage est ins&eacute;r&eacute;e dans le contrat, alors un recours devant un tribunal &eacute;tranger risque d'&ecirc;tre long et co&ucirc;teux au donneur d'ordre en frais judiciaires et extra-judiciaires. Si, par hasard, celui-ci poss&egrave;de les fonds et les ressources n&eacute;cessaires pour y parvenir, un second probl&egrave;me attend le donneur d'ordre: l'ex&eacute;cution de son jugement, une &eacute;tape qui pr&eacute;sente parfois de belles surprises ... Que le recours ait lieu par voie d'arbitrage ou par une action devant les tribunaux civils, il faut bien v&eacute;rifier la solvabilit&eacute; du cocontractant et si celui-ci poss&egrave;de des actifs saisissables pour l'ex&eacute;cution &eacute;ventuelle du jugement.



<p>



<h3>4.  Conclusion</h3>







L'&eacute;tude des tendances actuelles de la fraude du b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire d'un cr&eacute;dit documentaire nous a permis de r&eacute;pondre &agrave; la question pos&eacute;e dans l'introduction, soit de savoir si on peut envisager une uniformisation dans un avenir plus ou moins rapproch&eacute; des principes g&eacute;n&eacute;raux touchant la fraude. 



<p>



Une premi&egrave;re constatation a trait &agrave; l'exigence de la stricte conformit&eacute; des documents. Malgr&eacute; que les tribunaux adoptent une attitude restrictive &agrave; l'&eacute;gard de cette exigence, il se d&eacute;gage des d&eacute;cisions r&eacute;centes un consensus quant &agrave; la possibilit&eacute; pour une banque d'accepter des documents non conformes sans engendrer sa responsabilit&eacute;, en autant que ceux-ci ne contiennent que des erreurs minimes n'ayant aucune influence sur la bonne marche du cr&eacute;dit documentaire. Le futur est cependant probl&eacute;matique car l'informatisation des documents remet en doute l'&eacute;tape cruciale de la v&eacute;rification des documents, ces derniers pouvant &ecirc;tre rejet&eacute;s pour un simple d&eacute;tail. 



<p>



Il est presqu'unanime en jurisprudence et en doctrine que la fraude peut &ecirc;tre invoqu&eacute;e par le donneur d'ordre seulement lorsque le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire est &agrave; l'origine de la fraude ou qu'il ait eu connaissance de celle-ci. De plus, la fraude n'est pas opposable aux tiers de bonne foi, dont le d&eacute;tenteur r&eacute;gulier, sauf au porteur fran&ccedil;ais. Cependant, le point crucial concerne le fait que les tribunaux &eacute;trangers acceptent difficilement que la fraude commise dans le contrat de base soit opposable au



b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire fautif. 



<p>



Puisque nous sommes &agrave; l'aube du cr&eacute;dit &eacute;lectronique, les fraudeurs sont &agrave; l'aff&ucirc;t et plusieurs solutions aux probl&egrave;mes potentiels ont &eacute;t&eacute; sugg&eacute;r&eacute;s par la C.N.U.D.C.I. et par quelques auteurs. La fraude ne sera probablement jamais enray&eacute;e, mais cette r&eacute;volution du cr&eacute;dit documentaire apporte un espoir afin d'en diminuer la port&eacute;e.



<p>



Actuellement, la position restrictive des tribunaux face &agrave; l'exigence de la stricte conformit&eacute; des documents a une influence certaine sur la mani&egrave;re dont ceux-ci envisagent l'intensit&eacute; de la fraude. Le degr&eacute; de preuve requis pour d&eacute;montrer la fraude demeure relativement &eacute;lev&eacute;, que ce soit pour l'obtention d'une injonction, d'une saisie avant jugement ou d'un recours en dommages contre la banque, le tout ayant pour effet que ces recours sont difficilement accord&eacute;s. Tout le probl&egrave;me r&eacute;side finalement dans le choix que l'on doit effectuer entre le respect du principe d'autonomie de la lettre de cr&eacute;dit et la lutte contre la fraude en facilitant l'accessibilit&eacute; des recours au donneur d'ordre, le cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant.

<blockquote>



The courts do recognize a distinction between minor and major variations or discrepancies, the distinction being the degree of materiality sufficient to permit the issuing bank to refuse payment to the beneficiary under the credit. Minor variations between the credit requirements and the documents tendered may relate to the use of words in the singular rather than the plural, superfluous adjectives descriptive of the goods, numbers in sets rather than in totals, and obvious typographical errors. In determining whether variation is minor and therefore of no consequence to the obligation of the bank to pay, the courts often look to the business custom in the locality as to the use and importance of the discrepancies in question.

a. the issuer must honor the draft or demand for payment if honor is demanded by a negotiating bank or other holder of the draft or demand which has taken the draft or demand under the credit and under circumstances which would make it a holder in due course (Section 3--302) and in an appropriate case would make it a person to whom a document of title has been duly negotiated (Section 7--502) or a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser of a certificated security (Section 8--302); and

<h3>I. Introduction</h3>

Negotiations are taking place with First Nations across Canada with a view to concluding self-government agreements. These negotiations may eventually lead to the creation of a third order of law-making institutions in Canada, along with Parliament and the provincial legislatures. Two main types of issues arise in these negotiations: what range of legislative powers should First Nations exercise; and how will First Nations' legislative powers be made to fit into the existing framework of federal and provincial  legislative jurisdiction. 
<p>
In this article, I skip over the first issue, and focus instead on the second. In particular, I am interested in how current approaches to distinguishing between the legislative jurisdiction of Parliament and the legislative jurisdiction of provincial legislatures will apply in the context of First Nation self-government jurisdiction. This latter question is of particular interest because it is likely that some powers of First Nations will not be defined in the same way as federal and provincial jurisdiction are defined under the Canadian Constitution.
<p>
I have chosen to focus on this aspect of self-government for two reasons. First, it is difficult to discuss the scope and content of self-government powers on a generic basis. The powers that are of great interest to some First Nations may be of only limited interest to others, due to their differing situations, conditions, and goals. This means that self-government powers are best determined on a First Nation-by-First Nation basis, which in turn suggests that it may not be very helpful to comment in the abstract on the specific substantive powers that should be included in self-government agreements.
<p>
Second, while the substance of self-government powers may be difficult to address on a generic basis, the situation is different with respect to some of the legal and other technical challenges associated with the implementation of self-government. Many of these challenges can be expected to recur in virtually all cases where First Nations are negotiating new legal relationships with Parliament and the provincial legislatures; if unresolved, they could become stumbling blocks in the path of implementing workable self-government arrangements. 
<p>
By spotting and removing these stumbling blocks as early in the process as possible, the costs of negotiating
self-government---in financial and in human terms---can be kept as low as possible, so that the benefits of self-government can begin flowing sooner. This will benefit government, which will be able to minimize the negotiation costs. This will be of even greater benefit to First Nations, which will achieve their self-government objectives sooner, and which will also have to spend less money on lawyers and consultants and negotiators, allowing more of the benefits to flow instead to their members. While I may be guilty of exaggerating the
significance of these technical challenges to some extent, the fact remains that they exist and that they must be overcome in order for negotiated self-government arrangements to be implemented.
<p>
Resolving these technical challenges would facilitate the implementation of self-government arrangements. Resolution would also allow both supporters and critics of self-government to focus their attention on the more important issue of the scope and nature of self-government powers. Whyte points out that legal obstacles have been raised by critics of self-government out of genuine concern, but also as an indirect way to express opposition to
self-government;<sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup> hence addressing the technical concerns surrounding self-government will help to focus debate on the merits of self-government for First Nations. Finally, while it is problematic to discuss the scope of self-government powers without directly involving the First Nations concerned, the situation is different for these more technical issues. As Hall states,
<blockquote>
Perhaps the most useful role that non-natives can play in the effort to achieve native self-government is not to design regimes of self-government but rather to demonstrate methods by which non-native legal and governmental structures can co-exist with native [self-government].<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup>
</blockquote>
It is my hope that this article's examination of the implications of the traditional approaches to sorting out legislative
jurisdiction will assist in facilitating the implementation of self-government arrangements for First Nations in Canada.
<p>
SOME UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
<p>
In focusing on this specific topic, I am passing over many other very important issues related to the recognition and
implementation of aboriginal self-government in Canada. Those issues are probably of much greater importance from a public policy perspective than the narrow issue I am examining. Those issues are beyond the scope of this paper, but they are nonetheless present in the background. I propose to deal with them by setting out the
following three assumptions:
<p>
1.  <i>Self-Government Is Coming, and Preparations Should Be Made</i><br>
A great deal of time, effort and money has been invested in self-government in the last two decades in Canada, and results are beginning to show. More and more First Nations are taking on greater responsibility for their affairs and for the well-being of their members. I am assuming that this trend will continue, with more First Nations seeking to have their self-government powers recognized and implemented. 
<p>
Most of the controversy around self-government focusses on whether self-government powers for First Nations are desirable, and on whether First Nations should have law-making powers over certain subject matters. While I feel that First Nations will be better off running their own affairs, my purpose with this paper is not to argue for or against the coming of self-government or its substantive scope and content; those are policy issues beyond the scope of this work.
<p>
Virtually all provincial governments now accept the need to negotiate self-government agreements with First Nations; some of those governments even view those negotiations as desirable. The federal government is also---at least at the political level---pushing for speedy conclusion of self-government agreements with First Nations. Therefore it seems clear that self-government is on its way, and an important contribution that can be made now is to try to resolve known technical problems so that self-government can be implemented as quickly and as efficiently as possible.
<p>
2.  <i>Self-Government Powers Will Likely Be Defined Through Negotiated Self-Government Agreements</i><br>
I am not concerned in this paper with whether self-government powers arise from an inherent right, or from some
other source.<sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup> In either case, it seems most likely that the specific powers and jurisdiction of First Nations will be defined through negotiated agreements with other affected levels of government---the federal and provincial governments, in particular. These negotiated agreements will set out the range and scope of First Nations' law-making powers, and will also address the relationship between those powers and the powers of Parliament and the provincial legislatures. 
<p>
This is not the only possible option. McNeil,<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup> for example, argues that First Nations' inherent self-government powers may be exercised by the First Nations, without any need for First Nations to get permission from government or to negotiate agreements with government. In the event of a conflict between a First Nations law and a federal law, McNeil argues that the government would have to meet a stringent justificatory test in order to be able to override the First Nation law:
<blockquote>
For these new definitions to be meaningful, s. 35(1) [of the <cite>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite>] has to be interpreted as creating a constitutional space for Aboriginal governments and laws. The jurisdiction these governments can exercise within that space would extend to all components of the Aboriginal and treaty rights that the section recognizes and affirms, which, as we have seen, probably includes all aspects of Aboriginal life. What the Aboriginal peoples have to do if they want to exercise their jurisdiction is to fill this constitutional space with Aboriginal laws. To the extent that these laws, whether customary or legislative in nature, are already in place, the task is simply to act on them and demonstrate their existence. Where they are not in place, Aboriginal peoples have the option of making them by exercising their inherent right of self-government. Failing that, however, federal laws infringing their Aboriginal and treaty rights which meet the justificatory test will continue to apply to them due to the decision in <cite>Sparrow</cite>.<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup>
<p>
To the extent that Aboriginal and treaty rights are adequately regulated by Aboriginal laws, federal laws infringing
those rights cannot apply to them. The conclusion flows from the <cite>Sparrow</cite> decision. As we have seen, before federal laws are allowed to infringe Aboriginal and treaty rights, the Supreme Court said a valid legislative objective must exist. Moreover, that objective has to be pursued in a manner which infringes those rights as little as possible. But if an Aboriginal people is already regulating its own rights in a way which is consistent with the
legislative objective, there can be no need, and therefore no justification, for the federal laws to apply.<sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup>
</blockquote>
This approach, therefore, would not require negotiations over self-government powers ---rather, the scope and content of self-government powers and the relationship of First Nations' laws to federal and provincial legislation would be determined in court on a case-by-case basis as disputes arise.
<p>
This is not unlike the current situation in the United States, where a series of court decisions over the last century has recognized and defined a wide range of self-government powers for First Nations in the United States.<sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup> I believe, however, that relying on the courts to define the substance of First Nations' self-government powers, through litigation of specific questions on a case-by-case basis, would be extremely
expensive for First Nations, government and third parties, and would also create an unacceptable degree of uncertainty. In addition, the courts appear reluctant to assume the responsibility for recognizing First Nations' self-government jurisdiction.<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup>
<p>
Therefore, for the purposes of this article, I am assuming that the details of self-government powers will be set out in agreements negotiated between First Nations and government. This would include details related to specific powers of First Nations, such as those in the field of criminal law, details related to the application of the <cite>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite> to First Nations governments and laws, and details related to the relationship between First Nations jurisdiction and that of Parliament and the provincial legislatures.
<p>
3.  <i>Self-Government Agreements Will Result in the Creation of a Coordinate Third Order of Government within the Canadian Constitutional Framework</i><br>
Although it is by no means certain, and although there is no unanimity of opinion on the question, it appears likely that self-government powers of First Nations will eventually be recognized and constitutionally protected as a third order of government.<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup> This means that First Nations' law-making jurisdiction
will not be delegated federal or provincial jurisdiction, but rather will be an independent third order of government, in the same way that the provincial legislatures are an independent order of government from the federal Parliament. The simplest way in which this could occur is through recognition of individual self-government agreements as treaties or land claims agreements within the meaning of s. 35 of the <cite>Constitution Act, 1982</cite>. An alternate approach would be to amend the Canadian constitution itself, in order to accommodate this new order of government. This paper, however does not address the precise means by which self-government powers may be
implemented and protected. For my purposes, I simply assume that this new order of government will be created.
<p>
The implications of this assumption are that First Nations' legislative powers will have to be respected by the federal and provincial levels of government in the same way that they must respect each other's jurisdiction, and that the same types of problems that arise in determining which order of government may properly assume jurisdiction for a given matter will arise between federal and First Nations' jurisdiction and between provincial and First Nations' jurisdiction.
<p>
THE JURISDICTIONAL PROBLEM
<p>
The premise of this paper is that the approach that the courts take to resolving jurisdictional disputes between First
Nations and other orders of government will be rooted in the practices developed to deal with the existing constitutional division of powers. The Canadian court system has been dealing with division of powers disputes since shortly after Confederation, and has developed a number of concepts which it applies consistently.
<p>
It was decided early on that all possible subject matters of legislation are distributed under the Constitution between Parliament and the provincial legislatures. This has been taken to mean that there is no subject matter that is outside the legislative competence of either Parliament or the legislatures.<sup><a href="#ten">10</a></sup> In the context of self-government, McNeil notes that this means that no residual powers of self-government are left for
First Nations under the Constitution.<sup><a href="#eleven">11</a></sup>
<p>
The concept of the full allocation of powers between Parliament and the legislatures, then, has three implications with respect to government. First, when disputes arise about whether a given subject matter falls within the legislative jurisdiction of Parliament or of the provinces, the courts are normally faced with an either/or decision: the subject matter falls either within Parliament's jurisdiction or within the relevant legislature's jurisdiction---there is no third possibility. However, assuming that First Nations eventually become recognized as a third order of
government in Canada, and assuming that these First Nations exercise their powers independently of one another, in the future the courts' task will be much more complicated. No longer will there be only two parties disputing legislative jurisdiction---there will be the jurisdictional claims of First Nations to consider as well. 
<p>
Second, the current constitutional paradigm views all powers, including those affecting members of First Nations, as being allocated either to Parliament or to legislatures. This means that the subject matters over which First Nations will have jurisdiction will have to be taken from the current powers of either Parliament or the provinces. Most but not all of this jurisdiction will be carved from Parliament's jurisdiction, as section 91(24) of the <cite>Constitution Act, 1867</cite>, has been given a very wide interpretation by the courts, to the extent that virtually all aspects of life for Indian people and First Nations are governed by the federal <cite>Indian Act</cite>.<sup><a href="#twelve">12<./a></sup> Provincial jurisdiction may be involved as well, as provincial laws of general application apply to Indian people and First Nations, as they would to other residents of a province, as long as they do not single out Indians or affect &quot;Indianness&quot; in some other way.<sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup> As will be shown below, however, it appears likely that self-government arrangements will not adopt this exclusive approach to distribution of powers, but will instead provide for concurrency of powers to a significant extent. The powers of First Nations may overlap to a substantial degree those of Parliament or provincial legislatures.
<p>
Third, the powers of a provincial legislature have been construed as applying only within the fairly strictly defined limits of the territory of the province.<sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup> This means that there has been no significant problem created by provincial powers overlapping in the same geographic area. Under self-government agreements, however, as will be seen below, it is possible that some powers will not be limited to the lands over
which a First Nation has direct control. In part due to the relatively small amounts of land that will be held by First Nations (in comparison to the area of a province), as well as to the fact that the land may be held in the form of many smaller parcels of land instead of one large block, First Nations may not be content---and it may not be appropriate---to have their powers over certain subject matters limited to their land base. Therefore, negotiators of
self-government agreements, and the courts interpreting those agreements, will have to deal with ways of defining the geographic scope of powers that are currently not part of the way powers are divided between Parliament and the provincial legislatures.
<p>
In sum, then, this article focuses on the jurisdictional relationship between First Nations and other orders of government. It starts with the premise that the fact that the negotiated legislative powers of First Nations will likely be seen as being derived from the existing division of powers may lead the courts to apply the traditional approaches to resolving jurisdictional disputes in cases involving self-government jurisdiction of First Nations.<sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup> The purpose, however, of this paper is to demonstrate that there may be situations where the traditional approaches to defining constitutional jurisdiction will not be well suited to determinations of jurisdiction as between First Nations' legislative powers and those of either the federal or provincial levels. By identifying and analyzing the potential problems, I would hope that this paper could form a useful first step in the process of coming up with solutions to what I believe will be an important new issue in Canadian constitutional law---namely, dealing with the new interface between First Nations' legislative jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of Parliament and the provincial legislatures.
<p>
LIMITATIONS OF THIS ARTICLE
<p>
It should be acknowledged that this article is by necessity largely conjectural. This is due in part to the fact that there is virtually no experience in Canada with self-government arrangements, and hence there is no body of directly relevant case law on which I can base my analysis. While there is a burgeoning academic literature addressing many aspects of self-government, it must be recognized that there is still a great deal of uncertainty about how these issues would be handled by the courts. To deal with this, I have chosen to limit my frame of reference to existing approaches used by Canadian courts for dealing with jurisdictional issues between Parliament and the provincial legislatures.
<p>
Now, it should be recognized that not everyone would agree that the best way to go about solving problems related to aboriginal rights and interests would be through an examination of the traditional legal approaches. As Hall notes, aboriginal people in Canada have suffered a great deal as a result of the current legal system in Canada, and hence some people may feel that it is not appropriate to look to that system for new ways to address issues related to self-government.<sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup>
<p>
It seems clear, however, that self-government arrangements will be negotiated within the existing Canadian legal framework. The advent of self-government will require changes to the existing legal framework, but is not likely to result in fundamental rethinking of that framework. As a result, the challenge will be to work with the legal system in a way that enables First Nations to achieve their self-government objectives.<sup><a href="#seventeen">17</a></sup>
<p>
ORGANIZATION OF THE ARTICLE
<p>
The next section of this article looks at the relevant portions of two self-government agreements to illustrate how
self-government powers may be defined, and how the agreements deal with the relationship between First Nations' law-making powers and those of Parliament and provincial legislatures. The first is the self-government agreement for the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, one of four Yukon First Nations to have concluded a self-government agreement along with a final agreement resolving its comprehensive land claim. The second is the Sechelt self-government agreement. The Sechelt Indian Band was the first First Nation in Canada to negotiate a self-government agreement with the federal government, and it now exercises self-government powers set out in federal legislation.
<p>
The following section analyzes how the current approaches of the courts to determining constitutional jurisdiction could work in the context of First Nations self-government jurisdiction. The manner in which self-government powers are defined in the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations self-government agreement and in the Sechelt Indian Band self-government agreement is examined with a view to identifying potential problems in applying the traditional tests as a way to sort out jurisdictional questions. Special attention is paid to concurrent powers to deliver services to members of the First Nations.
<p>
The final section summarizes the conclusions of the paper.
<p>
<h3>II.  The Champagne and Aishihik First Nations and Sechelt Indian Band Self-Government Agreements</h3>

Although negotiations on First Nations self-government have been pursued in various parts of Canada for many years now, very few self-government agreements have actually been concluded. This section examines two such self-government agreements, one for the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations in the Yukon, and the second for
the Sechelt Indian Band on the Sunshine Coast in British Columbia.
<p>
THE CHAMPAGNE AND AISHIHIK FIRST NATIONS SELF-GOVERNMENT AGREEMENT
<p>
The Champagne and Aishihik First Nation is one of fourteen Yukon First Nations. The Champagne and Aishihik First Nations are centred in Haines Junction, a small town 150 kilometres west of the Yukon's capital of Whitehorse. The First Nations' 19,000 square mile traditional territory<sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup> comprises the extreme southwest corner of the Yukon, including the south half of Kluane National Park. While the First Nations have a total membership of about 900, almost half of them live outside of the First Nations' traditional territory, with the majority of those members living in Whitehorse.<sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a>
<p>
The Champagne and Aishihik First Nations have played a leading role in the negotiation of land claims agreements and self-government agreements in the Yukon. They are one of four Yukon First Nations to have concluded both land claims agreements and self-government agreements with the federal and territorial governments.<sup><a href="#twenty">20</a></sup> Although the land claims agreement<sup><a href="#twenty1">21</a></sup> is separate from the self-government agreement,<sup><a href="#twenty2">22</a></sup> the two agreements were negotiated concurrently and were intended to be complementary.
<p>
<i>The Land Base</i><br>
One of the key aspects of being a government, of course, is having a land base over which the governmental powers will apply. Under the terms of their land claims agreement, the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations will receive 2,427 square kilometres (or about 937 square miles) of settlement land. This will be comprised of:
<ul>
<li>51 larger rural blocks of land ranging in size from less than one square kilometre to 285 square kilometres, with an average size of about 48 square kilometres (or about 18 square miles);
<p>
<li>30 parcels of land in the community of Haines Junction, ranging in size from individual house lots to 384 hectares; and
<p>
<li>191 specific sites in rural areas (cabin sites and other specific sites) ranging from less than one hectare up to 150 hectares, with the majority in the range of about one to five hectares.
</ul>
These 272 parcels of land will constitute the land base upon which many of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations' self-government powers will be focussed.<sup><a href="#twenty3">23</a></sup>
<p>
<i>The Champagne and Aishihik First Nations Government Structure</i><br>
The self-government powers of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations will be exercised through their government structure. This government structure is defined in the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations Constitution. According to the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations Constitution, there are to be five components to its government.<sup><a href="#twenty4">24</a></sup> Of these, the most significant for the purposes of this
article is the First Nations Council, which is described as the law-making branch of the government.<sup><a href="#twenty5">25</a></sup> The Champagne and Aishihik First Nations self-government agreement itself does not set out elements of the government structure for the First Nations, although it does establish some parameters within which the First Nations' constitution is limited.<sup><a href="#twenty6">26</a></sup>
<p>
THE CHAMPAGNE AND AISHIHIK FIRST NATIONS SELF-GOVERNMENT POWERS
<p>
Section 13 of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations self-government agreement sets out the main legislative powers of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations. They are grouped into three main categories: exclusive powers, powers applying on settlement land, and powers applying to citizens.
<p>
<i>Exclusive Powers</i><br>
Section 13.1 sets out three exclusive powers of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations. These powers were intended to address essentially internal matters of administration of government and of benefits accruing to the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations or their members under the land claims agreement. They are described
as exclusive powers, in part in reflection of their nature, and in part to distinguish them from the powers listed in ss. 13.2 and 13.3, which are, by implication, not exclusive. These powers also overlap to some extent with powers of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations under the terms of their land claims agreement. Various provisions of that agreement enable the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations to manage and allocate the benefits accruing to the First Nations and their members under the agreement. Therefore, ss. 13.1.2 of the self-government agreement in particular is to some extent repetitive of powers already held by the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations.
<p>
<i>Powers Applying on Settlement Land</i><br>
Section 13.3 sets out a second grouping of legislative powers of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations. These are the powers that are intended to be limited to Champagne and Aishihik First Nations settlement land.<sup><a href="#twenty7">27</a></sup> It will be noted that these powers are framed in a manner that is not unlike the description of the powers of provincial legislatures under s. 91 of the <cite>Constitution Act, 1867</cite>. The powers are, by the introductory words of s. 13.3, said to extend to &quot;laws of a local or private nature on Settlement Land... .&quot;
<p>
This means that the powers of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations as enumerated in this section are limited to the land base of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, in much the same way that the powers of a provincial legislature are constrained within its provincial boundaries. In addition, the subject matter of Champagne and Aishihik First Nations laws is also limited to &quot;a local or private nature.&quot;  This implies that in addition to being limited to settlement land, these powers may only deal with the local and private aspects of those matters on settlement land. Any aspects that go beyond those local and private aspects---the regional, territorial, or national aspects of those matters---would presumably be beyond the legislative competence of the Champagne and Aishihik
First Nations, even though the matters may still affect their settlement land.
<p>
These powers are not characterized as &quot;exclusive,&quot; in contrast to the powers set out in s. 13.1 (above). This is for two main reasons. First, there are already federal or territorial laws covering many of these subject matters and which apply to lands which are to become Champagne and Aishihik First Nations settlement lands.
In order to avoid the creation of a legal vacuum with respect to the subject matters listed in s. 13.2, the self-government agreement provides for the continuation of existing federal and territorial laws, until such time as laws are enacted by the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations. This is set out in s. 13.5.1:
<blockquote>
13.5.1 Unless otherwise provided in this [self-government] Agreement, all Laws of General Application shall continue to apply to the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, its Citizens, and Settlement Land.
</blockquote>
The effect of this section appears to be akin to that of s. 129 of the <cite>Constitution Act, 1867</cite>, which provides for the continuation of laws in force at the time of Confederation, but subject to being repealed or amended by the appropriate legislative body. Another consequence of this section is that it is clear that the self-government agreement may set out powers of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, but it does not do so by removing those powers from the competence of the federal or territorial levels of government. This indicates that concurrent powers are envisioned. This is why these powers are not characterized as exclusive to the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations.
<p>
The situation in the Yukon differs from that in southern Canada with respect to the possibility of overlap with provincial powers. This is because the Yukon Legislative Assembly is a creature of federal legislation, created under Parliament's powers over lands in Canada not contained in a province.<sup><a href =  "#twenty8">28</a></sup> This means that there is no constitutional obstacle to the Yukon Legislative Assembly
having concurrent powers with the First Nations---the powers of both the Yukon Legislative Assembly and the First Nations are both based in federal jurisdiction.
<p>
Because of this situation of concurrent powers, it was necessary for the self-government agreement to address the issue of paramountcy in the event of conflict between laws. The self-government agreement explicitly addresses the question of the relationship of Champagne and Aishihik First Nations laws to Yukon laws, but does not explicitly address the relationship of Champagne and Aishihik First Nations laws to federal laws. The relevant provisions are s. 13.5.2 and 13.5.3:
<blockquote>
13.5.2 Canada and the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations shall enter into negotiations with a view to concluding, as soon as practicable, a separate agreement or an amendment of this Agreement which will identify the areas in which laws of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations shall prevail over federal Laws of General Application to the extent of any inconsistency or conflict.
<blockquote>
13.5.2.1 Canada shall Consult with the Yukon prior to concluding the negotiations described in 13.5.2.
<p>
13.5.2.2 Clause 13.5.2 shall not affect the status of the Yukon as a party to the negotiations or agreements referred to in 13.6.0 or 17.0.<sup><a href="#twenty9">29</a></sup>
</blockquote>
13.5.3 Except as provided in 14.0,<sup><a href="#thirty">30</a></sup> a Yukon Law of General
Application shall be inoperative to the extent that it provides for any matter for which provision is made in a law enacted by the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations.
</blockquote>
The effect of s. 13.5.3 is to make validly enacted Champagne and Aishihik First Nations laws paramount over laws on the same subjects passed by the Yukon Legislative Assembly.<sup><a href="#thirty1">31</a></sup> The situation with respect to federal laws is not so clear. Section 13.5.2 contains a commitment from the federal government to address the issue of paramountcy over federal legislation in subsequent negotiations with the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations. The effect of this clause, in the absence of a clause along the lines of s. 13.5.3, is to leave federal laws paramount over laws enacted by the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations.<sup><a href="#thirty2">32</a></sup>
<p>
These sections also deal implicitly with the issue of the subsequent repeal or amendment of laws continued in force under s. 13.5.1 of the self-government agreement. Those laws would continue to be in force until changed by the enacting body, or, in the case of a Yukon law, until the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations enacted a law which rendered inoperative the Yukon law under s. 13.5.1. 
<p>
<i>Powers Applying to Citizens</i><br>
The third category of powers is set out in s. 13.2. This category deals with the power of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations to make laws that apply to their citizens. The opening words to this section are key. Section 13.2 says that the power applies to the following matters &quot;in the Yukon.&quot;  This means that the law-making powers apply throughout the Yukon, and not only on Champagne and Aishihik First Nations settlement land. While many of these powers are similar to those exercised by provinces within their land bases, these powers are not limited to the land base of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations. The implications of this are
discussed in detail below. It is worth noting that there do not appear to be any examples of powers that are defined in a comparable manner in the <cite>Constitution Acts</cite>---all provincial powers are limited to their provincial boundaries, and federal powers, with some exceptions related to extra-territorial effects of laws, are also obviously constrained to the territorial limits of Canada.
<p>
It may be seen that the powers under this section include both regulatory powers and service-provision powers. For example, s. 13.2.6 allows the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations to make laws regulating adoption of and by its citizens in the Yukon. Similarly, s. 13.2.9 allows the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations to make laws regulating successions of its citizens in the Yukon. Others---like s. 13.2.7, which deals with child custody powers and child care services---are a hybrid of regulatory and service-provision powers, while still others---such as
s. 13.2.1---are purely related to provision of services. This distinction is discussed in greater detail below, as it may
significantly affect the types of problems that may be encountered in trying to keep jurisdiction straight as between the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations and government.
<p>
The issue of the paramountcy of Champagne and Aishihik First Nations laws over Yukon laws and federal laws is the same here as it was described above for settlement land-based powers. Similarly, the discussion of the continuation of existing laws is also the same here. It should, however, be emphasized again that these are
concurrent powers, but in this case it is not merely a case of concurrent powers between the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations and one government or the other. As stated above, there are thirteen other First Nations in the Yukon, and each of those is likely to end up with similar powers.<sup><a href="#thiry3">33</a></sup> Therefore, it is conceivable that there could be up to fifteen laws (fourteen Yukon First Nation laws plus the law of either the territorial or federal government) applying concurrently to any one given subject matter throughout the
entire Yukon. The only way to distinguish between applicable laws would be on the basis of the identity of the person in question---whether that person was a citizen of a First Nation, and if so, of which First Nation. The implications of this problem are also discussed below.
<p>
THE SECHELT INDIAN BAND SELF-GOVERNMENT AGREEMENT
<p>
The Sechelt Indian Band is located on the Sunshine Coast of British Columbia, approximately 60 kilometres from Vancouver. In 1988, the Band had about 700 members; most of them (about 560) lived on Sechelt lands. At that time, there were also about 500 non-native people living on Sechelt lands, mainly in the town of Sechelt.
<p>
The Sunshine Coast region is experiencing economic growth, and the Sechelt Indian Band is actively participating in that growth. Its land base is located in areas which give it great value due to demand for housing and development. In addition, the Band and its members are involved in many areas of the local economy, from
resource-based activities to tourism and other services.
<p>
The Sechelt Indian Band was the first First Nation in Canada to negotiate and implement a self-government arrangement with the government of Canada. This resulted in the passage in Parliament of the <cite>Sechelt Indian Band Self-Government Act</cite><sup><a href="#thirty4">34</a></sup> in 1986. The Sechelt Indian Band has also filed a comprehensive land claim with the federal government which has been accepted for negotiation, but which has not yet been negotiated.<sup><a href="#thirty5">35</a></sup>
<p>
<i>The Land Base</i><br>
While the Band is centred in the town of Sechelt, its land base includes approximately 1,000 hectares in 32 parcels scattered throughout the Band's 2,200 square mile traditional territory. These parcels were originally held as Indian reserves under the <cite>Indian Act</cite>, but since the coming into force of the <cite>Sechelt Act</cite>, the lands have been transferred to the Sechelt Indian Band. These lands are referred to as &quot;Sechelt lands&quot; under the <cite>Sechelt Act</cite>.<sup><a href="#thirty6">36</a></sup>
<p>
THE SECHELT INDIAN BAND'S GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE
<p>
The government structure of the Sechelt Indian Band is set out in its Constitution. The government structure consists of an elected Band Council comprised of one chief and four councillors.<sup><a href="#thirty7">37</a></sup> The Band Council has the power to pass laws, including laws setting out the procedure, within certain limits, for enacting and challenging laws.<sup><a href="#thirty8">38</a></sup> As was the
case with the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations' self-government agreement, the self-government agreement for the Sechelt Indian Band, as set out in the <cite>Sechelt Act</cite>, does not directly establish elements of the Band's Constitution but rather establishes certain parameters within which the Band's Constitution is limited.<sup><a href="#thirty9">39</a></sup>
<p>
THE SECHELT INDIAN BAND SELF-GOVERNMENT POWERS
<p>
The law-making powers of the Sechelt Indian Band are defined in two documents, the <cite>Sechelt Act</cite> and the Band's Constitution. The <cite>Sechelt Act</cite> sets out the powers for the Band in ss. 14 and 15. It may be seen that the <cite>Sechelt Act</cite> does not distinguish between exclusive powers, Sechelt land based powers or
citizen-based powers, apparently because virtually all of the non-administrative powers are limited to settlement land, and none of the powers are described as being exclusive to the Band Council.
<p>
In the case of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, two powers related to the management and administration of First Nations affairs and to the rights and benefits under the First Nations' land claims agreement and self-government agreement were described as being exclusive. Comparable powers exist under the <cite>Sechelt
Act</cite>, for example, in subsections (f), (r), (s), and (t) of s. 14. However, these powers are not stated to be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Sechelt Indian Band Council. As these powers deal with the administration of the Band and its assets, they are not necessarily limited to Sechelt lands.
<p>
Most of the remaining powers are described as applying only on Sechelt lands. These are primarily powers relating to land management, resource management, and regulation of activities on Sechelt lands. The provision of health services<sup><a href="#forty">40</a></sup> and the education of Band members<sup><a href="#forty1">41<./a></sup> are also limited to Sechelt lands.<sup><a href="#forty2">42</a></sup>
<p>
Only one other power is not limited to Sechelt lands. This is the provision of social and welfare services &quot;with respect to Band members,&quot; which includes the custody and placement of children of Band members.<sup><a href="#forty3">43</a></sup> This power appears to apply to all Band members, whether resident on or off Sechelt lands. As with services-provision powers of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, the fact that this power extends off Sechelt land creates the possibility of overlap not only with the federal or
provincial government, but also with the laws of any other British Columbia First Nation which has a comparably defined power.
<p>
However, while the Band had this power in theory, it was not able to exercise this power, at least up to 1989. This is because it is not enough that the Band have power under the <cite>Sechelt Act</cite> to make laws on certain subject matters: s. 14 also requires that the Band constitution allow the Band Council to enact laws on those subject matters; &quot;The Council has, [power] <i>to the the extent that it is authorized by the Constitution of the
Band</i>, ... .&quot;<sup><a href="#forty4">44</a></sup> This means that, while the <cite>Sechelt Act</cite> establishes law-making powers, the Band Constitution may limit those powers. This is in fact what happened.
<p>
As of 1989, the Band's Constitution authorized the Council to make laws in relation to 18 of the 21 subsections in section 14,<sup><a href="#forty5">45</a></sup> in most cases with either restrictions on the permissible content of laws enacted on those matters, or restrictions on the process to be followed in enacting laws on specific matters.<sup><a href="#forty6">46</a></sup> However, the constitution did not authorize laws to be made in respect of powers under subsections (g), (h) or (i). Therefore, while the <cite>Sechelt Act</cite> says that the Band Council may make laws in these services-related areas, the Council did not, up to 1989, have the power to do so under the Band's Constitution.
<p>
As with the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations self-government agreement, another important aspect is the
relationship between laws enacted by the Sechelt Indian Band and laws enacted by Parliament or British Columbia. This includes the two aspects discussed above: continuation of existing laws, and paramountcy.
<p>
With respect to the continuation of existing laws, s. 35 of the <cite>Sechelt Act</cite> provides for the continuation of the provisions of the <cite>Indian Act</cite>:
<blockquote>
35. (1) Subject to section 36, the <cite>Indian Act</cite> applies, with such modifications as the circumstances require, in respect of the Band, its members, the Council and Sechelt lands except to the extent that the <cite>Indian Act</cite> is inconsistent with this Act, the constitution of the Band or a law of the Band.
<p>
(2) For greater certainty, the <cite>Indian Act</cite> applies for the purpose of determining which members of the Band are &quot;Indians&quot; within the meaning of that Act... .
</blockquote>
This means that, until such time as the Sechelt Band Council exercises its powers in accordance with the <cite>Sechelt Act</cite> and the Band's Constitution, the provisions of the <cite>Indian Act</cite> will continue to apply to the subject matters in question. If the Council does make laws inconsistent with the <cite>Indian Act</cite>, then the Band laws will prevail. If there are any matters provided for in the <cite>Indian Act</cite> which are not subject matters over which the Band will have law-making powers under the <cite>Sechelt Act</cite>, the <cite>Indian Act</cite> provisions will continue to apply.
<p>
Section 37 of the <cite>Sechelt Act</cite> deals with the application of other federal laws:
<blockquote>
37. All federal laws of general application in force in Canada are applicable to and in respect of the Band, its members and Sechelt lands, except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with this Act.
</blockquote>
This clause has two effects. First, it ensures that other existing federal laws will continue to apply to the Sechelt Indian Band, its members and Sechelt lands. The second effect, which differs from the effect of s. 35 with respect to the <cite>Indian Act</cite>, is to make other federal laws paramount over laws enacted by the Band Council. Therefore, while s. 35 gives the Band Council the power to pass laws that are inconsistent with the <cite>Indian Act</cite> and allows those laws to prevail over the <cite>Indian Act</cite>, s. 37 means that any law of the Band Council that is inconsistent with other federal laws is inoperative to the extent of the inconsistency.
<p>
Therefore, the situation with respect to federal laws is that the Sechelt Indian Band has powers that are concurrent with federal powers over the same matters. In the event of conflict between a federal law and a Sechelt law, the federal law prevails. The only exception would be where the federal law involved is the <cite>Indian Act</cite>, in which case the Band's law prevails.
<p>
Section 38 addresses the continuation of provincial laws, and the issue of paramountcy with respect to provincial laws:
<blockquote>
38. Laws of general application of British Columbia apply to or in respect of the members of the Bands except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with the terms of any treaty, this or any other Act of Parliament, the constitution of the Band or a law of the Band.
</blockquote>
The extent of the impact of this clause is not clear. Section 88 of the <cite>Indian Act</cite> also provides for the application of provincial laws of general application &quot;to and in respect of Indians in the province.&quot;  Section 38 of the <cite>Sechelt Act</cite> would appear to be aimed at the same laws as s. 88 of the <cite>Indian Act</cite>: laws which may affect &quot;Indianness,&quot; such as hunting laws. As with s. 88 of the <cite>Indian Act</cite>, any valid provincial law of general application would apply to the Sechelt Indian Band and
its members regardless of s. 38 of the <cite>Sechelt Act</cite>. 
<p>
Therefore, it appears that s. 38 has a fairly limited potential application, affecting only those provincial laws that
might have been held inapplicable to the Sechelt Indian Band and its members on the grounds that the laws affected their &quot;Indianness.&quot; In contrast to s. 88 of the <cite>Indian Act</cite>, this section does not purport to render those provincial laws inoperative to the extent that they cover the same subject matters as in the <cite>Indian Act</cite> or the <cite>Sechelt Act</cite>. Rather, it uses the more restricted test of inconsistency. Hence, provincial laws affecting &quot;Indianness&quot; would by virtue of s. 38 of the <cite>Sechelt Act</cite> continue to apply, but they would be subject only to the normal rule of inconsistency, and not the expanded rule set out in s. 88 of the <cite>Indian Act</cite>.
<p>
This means that if there is any overlap with provincial laws, it will probably not be very large in practice. In large part this is due to the way in which the Band's powers are set out in the <cite>Sechelt Act</cite>; few of those powers overlap with existing provincial responsibilities, with the possible exception of powers related to health, social and welfare services. Therefore, the potential for overlap in the context of the Sechelt Indian Band's
self-government powers under the <cite>Sechelt Act</cite> is more in the area of federal jurisdiction than provincial jurisdiction. As well, the effect of this overlap in the area of service provision is less dramatic than with respect to provincial services. This is because in these areas, the federal government is involved in providing these
services only to Indian people and First Nations, and not to all residents of a province.
<p>
 <h3>III.  Determining Jurisdiction in a Self-Government Context</h3>

This section looks at how the approaches used by the courts for determining federal/provincial jurisdictional disputes may work if applied in the context of jurisdictional disputes between First Nations' legislative powers and those of either Parliament or the provincial legislatures.
<p>
In considering how the courts may treat powers such as those outlined in the previous section, it should be remembered that I am assuming that self-government powers eventually will be entrenched in the Constitution as a third order of government. The implication is that the courts will not be dealing with bodies exercising delegated
legislative powers, but bodies which derive their law-making powers directly from the Constitution. Therefore, the analysis that follows does not treat self-government powers as delegated powers, but rather as self-standing powers. As a result, no consideration is given to judicial review of the exercise of delegated legislative powers. The analysis proceeds as though the courts will view First Nations' jurisdiction as coordinate with federal and provincial jurisdiction.
<p>
It should also be noted that this discussion is not intended to be a detailed analysis of the implications of specific wording of specific decisions as they may apply to self-government. Rather, I am more interested in the general approaches that may be taken, and the broader implications of those approaches.
<p>
As was seen above, self-government powers under the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations self-government agreement and the Sechelt Indian Band self-government agreement can be divided into three main types of powers: exclusive powers, powers applying on settlement lands, and powers applying to citizens. Each of these categories is discussed in turn in the sections which follow, in light of the predominant approach currently used by the courts to
resolving questions of jurisdictional overlap between federal and provincial jurisdictions. Courts initially apply the pith and substance approach to determine the content of the laws, and then apply the inconsistency test to determine if the two laws may co-exist or whether they are in conflict.
<p>
APPLICATION IN THE CONTEXT OF EXCLUSIVE POWERS
<p>
As discussed above, some powers of First Nations may end up being described as exclusive powers, in much the same way as powers of provincial legislatures are exclusive under s. 92 of the <i>Constitution Act, 1867</i>. Examples were seen in ss. 13.1.1 and 13.1.2 of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations self-government
agreement. Those powers dealt primarily with the internal administration of the First Nations and of the benefits and rights accruing to the First Nations under their self-government agreement and their land claims agreement. In this section, I will use those powers as examples to illustrate how the courts could approach powers which are defined in an exclusive manner.
<p>
The powers are not specifically limited to any one geographic area, such as the settlement land of the First Nations.
However, they are defined very narrowly: the powers cover very specific attributes of the internal affairs of the First Nation, and as such do not directly affect either of the other levels of government. In addition, as these are defined as exclusive powers, it is implicit that there is intended to be no concurrency of powers with either level of government. This would clearly be the case anyway in respect of provincial powers, as provinces would not be
able to legislate on matters which are so clearly related to the &quot;Indianness&quot; of the First Nations. 
<p>
The federal government, of course, would continue to have the power under s. 91(24) to make laws affecting the First Nations, at least while self-government powers are conferred by delegated federal powers (as is now the situation) instead of being entrenched in the Constitution. Therefore, until the powers are entrenched, the federal government would have concurrent powers with the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations over the matters set out in s. 13.1 of their self-government agreement. However, as I am basing my analysis on the assumption that these self-government agreements will be entrenched sooner or later, it may be argued that even if Parliament maintains a general residual power over &quot;Indians and lands reserved for the Indians&quot; under s. 91(24), the exclusive powers of the First Nations under s. 13.1 of the self-government agreement should be seen as a specific exception to the federal power. Any other reading of the section would render the term &quot;exclusive&quot; meaningless.
<p>
Assuming, then, that these powers would be characterized as exclusive to the First Nations, the question then arises as to how the courts would address disputes about legislative jurisdiction in this area. I suggest that these powers will not present significant new issues for the courts. The issues that the court will face will be familiar, albeit in a different context. Given that the issues will be familiar, it is likely that the courts will also approach the issues in the same way as they have in other contexts.
<p>
First, the courts would likely follow a similar approach to deciding whether a given law was in fact within the power of the First Nations to enact. This would be in accordance with the &quot;pith and substance&quot; approach that has been used in federal-provincial jurisdictional disputes for over a century now. The courts would have to characterize the impugned First Nations' law on the basis of its purpose and effect to see if it fell within one of the heads of power of the First Nations. If so, the law would be valid; if not, the law would be <i>ultra vires</i>.
<p>
Second, if the law were valid, then the courts would have to determine whether there was a conflict with a federal or provincial law which could affect the First Nations' law. As suggested above, it is not likely that there would be a conflict with a provincial law, because the First Nations powers in s. 13.1 deal with narrowly defined matters which are directly related to the status of the First Nations as &quot;Indians.&quot;  Hence, overlap with provincial powers under the current distribution of powers would not be likely to arise.
<p>
Similarly, if the self-government power is interpreted as implying that there is no concurrent federal power on the same matter, as I believe it should (especially in the case of powers such as those in section 13.1 which apply only to the internal affairs of the First Nation), then there would be no problem with conflicts either, as this would mean that Parliament would not have the power to pass laws on these specifically defined matters. If, however, Parliament maintained a continuing responsibility for Indians and First Nations generally under section 91(24), then the possibility of concurrent legislative jurisdiction would arise in this field.
<p>
In that event, the courts would probably apply the test of inconsistency in the manner that they apply it in cases of overlap between federal and provincial laws. This would mean that the courts would ask if it there was an express contradiction between the two laws, such that compliance with one would mean breach of the other.<sup><a href="#forty7">47</a></sup> It may be seen that this approach could cause some problems. For example, it is conceivable that the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations could enact a law dealing with administrative procedures to be followed in the management of the First Nations' affairs, and that those laws could conflict with
provisions of the <cite>Indian Act</cite> or some other federal legislation. In such a case, it is quite likely that compliance with the First Nations' law would mean non-compliance with the federal law. This would trigger the application of the doctrine of paramountcy, which at present under the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations self-government agreement is a rule of federal paramountcy. The First Nations' law could therefore be rendered inoperative to the extent of the inconsistency if such an approach were followed by the courts.
<p>
For this reason, if there were held to be concurrency of First Nations and federal powers in this area (despite the express wording of s. 13.1), a better approach to resolving overlap may be required, in order to avoid frustrating the purpose and intent of the self-government agreement. One option is the occupied field test, which has been applied recently by the Supreme Court of Canada, in a case where the Court felt that the inconsistency test would frustrate
the purpose of the federal legislation.<sup><a href="#forty8">48</a></sup>
<p>
However, this approach is fraught with other difficulties. For one, the approach is more subjective, as it requires the courts to assess the intent of the legislature rather than the effect of the legislation. In addition, the occupied field test is more likely to find conflict between laws than is the inconsistency test. In this context, where federal laws would be paramount over the First Nations' law, the occupied field test would make it more likely that First Nations' laws would be rendered inoperative due to overlap. From the courts' perspective, the occupied field test is much more interventionist; the inconsistency test, by comparison, represents an attitude of judicial restraint, where overlapping laws are allowed to co-exist as long as there is no direct conflict between them. The difficulty with both approaches is that they countenance federal jurisdiction where the wording of the self-government agreement
suggests none was intended.
<P>Hence, I suggest that a better approach would simply be to construe federal powers as inapplicable to the subject matters in question, meaning that the federal government would not have the power to enact valid legislation which overlaps directly with the powers of the First Nations under s. 13.1.<sup><a href="#forty9">49</a></sup> This sort of approach---a modified form of interjurisdictional immunity---would also appear to be more in keeping with the courts' mindset of trying to uphold laws unless there are clear conflicts that necessitate imposing the doctrine of paramountcy to render one law inoperative---a mindset of trying to maintain validly enacted laws. 
<p>
APPLICATION IN THE CONTEXT OF NON-EXCLUSIVE POWERS CONFINED TO SETTLEMENT LAND
<p>
An important area of jurisdiction under the self-government agreements for both the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations and the Sechelt Indian Band is the powers that are restricted to settlement land or Sechelt lands. The subject matters enumerated in s. 13.3 of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations self-government agreement
and in the majority of the heads in s. 14 of the Sechelt self-government agreement confer important powers over resource management, land management, and regulation of activities, public order and other matters.
<p>
As was noted in the previous section, these powers are not stated to be exclusive to the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations or the Sechelt Indian Band. In addition, under both self-government agreements, federal and provincial or territorial laws are stated to continue to apply to the First Nations, their members and (under the
Champagne and Aishihik First Nations self-government agreement) their lands, generally until replaced by First Nations laws. Further, in the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations self-government agreement, the First Nations' powers are limited by the introductory words of s. 13.3 to only the &quot;local or private&quot; aspects of the subject matters enumerated in subsections 13.3.1 through 13.3.23.<sup><a href="#fifty">50</a></sup> This
may mean that there will be substantial overlapping application of First Nations and federal or provincial laws on settlement lands.
<p>
This is because it is very likely, given the double aspect<sup><a href="#fifty1">51</a></sup> and incidental effects<sup><a href="#fifty2">52</a></sup> doctrines associated with the pith and substance approach to determining jurisdiction, that the federal or provincial/territorial governments will be able to find a valid basis
for enacting laws affecting settlement land or Sechelt lands. This is especially true in the case of Champagne and Aishihik First Nations' settlement land, as the &quot;local or private&quot; limitation on the First Nations' powers under s. 13.3 implies that any matters on settlement land that go beyond a local or private nature are not within the powers of the First Nations, and hence are within the powers of either Parliament or the Yukon Legislative Assembly.
<p>
The situation, therefore, will show some similarities to that which arises between federal and provincial jurisdiction, in that a province's jurisdiction is defined in a territory-based manner and is subject in practice to substantial overlap with federal powers. This is due primarily to the effects of the concepts of double aspect and incidental effects. It is also due, however, to the fact that provincial powers are generally construed as limited to matters of a provincial or more local scale, which in some cases has been taken to mean that the broader national dimensions of the same
subject matters should be construed as falling within federal jurisdiction.<sup><a href="#fifty3">53</a></sup>
<p>
Therefore, in the event that a dispute about overlapping jurisdiction arises with respect to a subject matter in s. 13.3 of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations self-government agreement or the powers of the Sechelt Indian Band applying to Sechelt lands, the similarities with federal-provincial jurisdictional issues would likely lead the courts to again apply the same approach described above---the test of inconsistency. Courts would first examine the validity of the two laws (First Nation and federal or provincial) in question. If both were valid (<i>i.e.</i>, within their respective legislative jurisdictions), then the courts would proceed to see if it were possible to comply with the requirements of both the First Nations law and the other law. If that were so, then there would be no conflict, and the doctrine of paramountcy would not come into play. Both laws would be allowed to stand, and persons affected by the laws would be required to comply with the stricter of the two laws. On the other hand, if it were determined that compliance with the First Nations law meant breach of the other law, or <i>vice versa</i>, then there would be a conflict, and the courts would have to determine which law was paramount over the other. In both cases,
the self-government agreements address the issue of paramountcy. 
<p>
In the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations self-government agreement, the paramountcy rules are set out in ss. 13.5.2 and 13.5.3. As demonstrated in the previous section, laws enacted by the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations will prevail over laws enacted by the Yukon Legislative Assembly, to the extent of the inconsistency.<sup><a href="#fifty4">54</a></sup> Under the agreement as it now stands, conflict between a
federal law and a First Nations law would be resolved in favour of the federal law.<sup><a href="#fifty5">55</a></sup>
<p>
In the <cite>Sechelt Act</cite>, the paramountcy rules are set out in ss. 37 and 38. Laws enacted by the Sechelt Indian Band would prevail over provincial laws,<sup><a href="#fifty6">56</a></sup> but not over federal laws, with the exception of the <cite>Indian Act</cite>.<sup><a href="#fifty7">57</a></sup> As was pointed out above, because of the way the Band's powers are defined in the <cite>Sechelt Act</cite> and because of the current situation with respect to the applicability of provincially-enacted laws to Indians and their lands, the paramountcy rule in s. 38 may not in practice affect many provincial laws.<sup><a href="#fifty8">58</a></sup>
<p>
This would appear to indicate that powers of First Nations that are defined on the territorial basis of the lands within the control of the First Nations would not present significant difficulties with respect to the application of traditional
approaches to resolving disputes about overlapping jurisdiction. The courts would be able to apply the same type of approach to the issue as it arises between First Nations and government as they currently do in disputes between federal and provincial governments. This is because the issue raised is much the same, even though the context is
different.
<p>
APPLICATION IN THE CONTEXT OF NON-EXCLUSIVE POWERS TIED TO CITIZENS
<p>
As was seen in the discussion of the powers of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations in the previous section,
self-government agreements have included powers that are defined in a manner unlike those set out in the Constitution. This new category consists of laws which are not defined on the basis of territoriality (<i>i.e</i>., that apply only within a given territory or geographic area), but rather on the basis of citizenship. In other words, these
are powers which apply in respect of a citizen of a First Nation, whether that person is on lands belonging to the First Nation or not. This differs from the current situation with respect to the application of provincial laws (which generally speaking only apply to residents in the province) and with respect to the application of the <cite>Indian Act</cite> or by-laws enacted by First Nations under the <cite>Indian Act</cite> (which generally only apply as long as the person is resident on a reserve).
<p>
In the case of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, their citizen-based powers are set out in section 13.2 of their self-government agreement. Some of those powers are regulatory in nature, some are services-oriented in nature,<sup><a href="#fifty9">59</a></sup> and some include both aspects.<sup><a href="#sixty">60</a></sup> The powers are stated to apply anywhere in the Yukon.<sup><a href="#sixty1">61</a></sup> In the case of the Sechelt Indian Band, the <cite>Sechelt Act</cite> sets out one services-oriented power which applies to members of the Sechelt Indian Band off Sechelt lands,<sup><a href="#sixty2">62</a></sup> although it appears that the Sechelt Indian Band's constitution may not currently permit this power to be exercised by the Band Council.<sup><a href="#sixty3">63</a></sup> This power appears to extend throughout Canada, as it is not expressly limited to any geographic area by the terms of the <cite>Sechelt Act</cite>.
<p>
The significance of this is that laws made under these powers may apply to citizens or members who are not living on the First Nation's land base---for example, to those who are living in an urban area or perhaps even on the lands of another First Nation. However, in many cases when Indian people leave the reserves, they may no longer be subject to the <cite>Indian Act</cite> regime, and hence provincial laws would apply to them instead. Therefore, a greater degree of concurrency or overlap of powers between the provincial governments and First Nations can be expected to arise in the case of powers applying to First Nations' members off First Nations' lands. 
<p>
While this fact in itself will create new challenges for the courts (or for negotiators of self-government agreements), another significant point to keep in mind is the tremendous potential for overlap between the laws of First Nations and the federal or provincial governments, or between the various First Nations. In the case of the Yukon, if powers similar to those of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations under s. 13.2 of their self-government agreement are included in the self-government agreements for the other 13 Yukon First Nations, the implication is that there may be as many as 15 validly enacted laws that may apply to one of these subject matters in any given area of the Yukon. The situation would be even more complicated in British Columbia, as there are more First Nations than in the Yukon. Although the potential for overlap is therefore very substantial, the difficulties that this overlap may
raise with respect to determination of jurisdiction are likely to differ according to the nature of the power in question. Therefore, the discussion that follows will look separately at the regulatory powers and the services-oriented powers.
<p>
<i>Citizen-Based Regulatory Powers</i><br>
The situation with respect to regulatory powers that are defined on the basis of citizenship may become complex, due to the potential for overlapping laws. However, from the perspective of approaches used by the courts to sorting out jurisdiction, it does not appear that these types of powers would create significant difficulties. 
<p>
The courts would be able to apply the same approach to dealing with jurisdiction under these powers as that used for dealing with self-government powers applying only to lands of the First Nations. They would first determine if the laws in question are both enacted within the legislative jurisdiction of the First Nation and the other government or First Nation, and then, if both laws are valid, determine if there is any conflict between the two laws. If it is possible to obey both regulatory laws by obeying the stricter of the two, then the courts would be able to uphold both laws. In the event that there was a conflict between the two laws, then the courts would resort to the paramountcy rules set out in the self-government agreement.
<p>
The result of this would be that the two overlapping laws would likely be upheld if there were no express conflict between them. For laws of a regulatory nature applying on non-First Nation lands (that is, on Crown land or privately held lands), this would mean that citizens of a First Nation would have to obey the laws of general application at a minimum, and if the First Nation law imposed a stricter standard, then the citizen would have to obey that standard as well. Therefore, the consequence of overlap would simply mean that the regulatory standards applicable to citizens would be no lower than the standards set out in laws of general application applying to other persons located off First Nations lands.
<p>
This result may, however, be seen as a problem in cases where a First Nation wishes for public policy reasons to implement a regime which has lower standards than those in the laws of general application. For example, a First Nation may wish to set up an adoption regime which does not contain the same level of formality as the regime established under the applicable provincial or territorial laws. The application of the normal test for inconsistency may in such cases lead to a result that is not intended or desired by either the First Nation or the government.
<p>
It is possible that another type of conflict could arise under this category of power, due to the manner in which eligibility for membership or citizenship may be defined by First Nations. In some cases, it is possible that a person would be eligible to be a member or citizen of more than one First Nation. Or, it is possible that a person may be eligible for membership or citizenship but has not become a member or citizen. The issue that would then arise
would be to which set of laws that person would be subject. If this question could not be answered under the tests of jurisdiction, courts would be able to resort to applicable conflicts-of-laws rules to resolve the matter. This aspect is, however, beyond the scope of this article.
<p>
<i>Citizen-Based Services-Oriented Powers</i><br>
The situation with respect to services-oriented powers is more complex. The problem in these cases is not so much with the creation of conflicting standards but rather with the concern over duplication of services. The issue arises because First Nations' citizens or members are likely to retain their eligibility for many services and benefits that are available to them as Canadian citizens and residents of a province or territory, in addition to being eligible for services provided by their First Nations.
<p>
This is the case under the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations self-government agreement. Sections 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations self-government agreement address the continuing rights of the First Nations' citizens:
<blockquote>
3.4 Unless otherwise provided pursuant to this Agreement or in a law enacted by the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, this Agreement shall not affect the ability of Citizens to participate in and benefit from Government programs for status Indians, non-status Indians or native people, as the case may be. Benefits under such programs shall be determined by the general criteria for such programs established from time to time.
<p>
3.5 Except for the purposes of determining which Citizens are &quot;Indians&quot; within the meaning of the <cite>Indian Act</cite>, R.S.C. 1985, c. I--5, the <cite>Indian Act</cite>, R.S.C. 1985, c. I--5, does not apply
to Citizens, the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations or Settlement Land.
<p>
3.6 This Agreement shall not:
<blockquote>
3.6.1 affect the rights of Citizens as Canadian citizens; and
<p>
3.6.2 unless otherwise provided pursuant to this Agreement or in a law enacted by the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, affect the entitlement of Citizens to all of the benefits, services, and protections of other Canadian citizens applicable from time to time.
</blockquote></blockquote>
These sections were intended to ensure that the First Nations citizens would have continuing rights of Canadian citizenship (including the same eligibility as other Yukon residents to benefit from programs and services offered to residents of the Yukon either by the federal or the territorial government) and that they would still be eligible for programs and services offered by the federal government under the <cite>Indian Act</cite>.
<p>
The consequence of such provisions is that the citizens of the First Nations would continue to be eligible for services provided by the Yukon government or the federal government under laws of general application, if those laws continued to apply to the First Nations' citizens, even though the First Nations had also decided to
exercise their powers under s. 13.2 and begin offering a similar service. For example, citizens could be eligible in their status as Yukon residents for social assistance payments from the Yukon government, and also be eligible for payments from the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations in their status as citizens of the First Nations. Similar situations could also arise with respect to other fields of services, such as health care, education, language
services, and so on.
<p>
It appears very likely that the result of the courts applying the traditional tests of jurisdiction would be to uphold
both sets of laws---after all, there is no conflict <i>per se</i> in being eligible to receive benefits from two sources. There is really no concept of a stricter standard that would have to be obeyed by the persons affected by the overlapping jurisdictions---the only issue would be whether they met the eligibility requirements for the
services in question. The consequence would be that both sets of laws would be upheld as validly applying to the citizens of the First Nations, and hence those citizens would have a right to services provided under both sets of laws. It may be argued that this is not necessarily undesirable from the perspective of the individuals involved, as it means that they will be able to choose whether they wish to participate in services offered by the First Nations or by
the government or perhaps both. However, from the perspective of both the First Nations and of government, serious concerns arise.
<p>
First, a First Nation may be concerned because this dual eligibility would allow its citizens effectively to ignore the
programs and services that the First Nation is offering, perhaps as part of an integrated social service regime, by simply opting to take the programs and services offered by government instead. This could undermine the ability of a First Nation to implement comprehensive regimes of programs and services which it wants to provide directly
to citizens.
<p>
The second concern may be more significant and concerns the financial impact on government and First Nations spending that the duplication of services would cause. If a First Nation begins providing a service that is already provided by government, then there will be a certain degree of duplication, at a minimum administrative cost duplication. There may also be concerns with &quot;double-dipping,&quot; whereby people eligible for both services actually take the services from both sources, even though the intent was that they be mutually exclusive. Government anxiety over this would increase as the number of First Nations with such service-oriented powers increased---and, as mentioned above, this will probably be 14 in the Yukon.
<p>
This potential concern is exacerbated under conditions of scarce financial resources. In such circumstances, government and First Nations will simply not be able to afford duplicate services. The financial impact could be very severe, and could reduce the level of services that government could provide to all residents of the
province or territory. For example, under the Yukon self-government agreements, funding for the Yukon First Nations is provided directly to the Yukon First Nations by the federal government. However, the federal government also provides much of the funding for the Yukon government through a formula financing agreement. This means that the federal government will be in a position to transfer funding from the Yukon government to Yukon First Nations as the Yukon First Nations take on responsibilities. As it is extremely unlikely that the federal government will agree to pay twice for the same service, it means that any funding paid to a Yukon First Nation for the provision of a given program or service will no longer be available to the Yukon government, even though the Yukon government may remain under an obligation to continue providing that same service or program to those citizens of the Yukon First Nation. The consequence of duplication of services would be that the government would have less money with which to provide the services but would still have the same number of people that are eligible for the service. The overall impact would be a reduction of the amount of funds <i>per capita</i> available for provision of services to residents of the territory.
<p>
Hence, in these situations, it seems quite possible that the usual approaches to determination of jurisdiction may not be appropriate. The current approach used by the courts has the effect of allowing two overlapping laws to continue to co-exist, unless there is a real impossibility of compliance with both laws. However, in the context of overlapping responsibilities for provision of services, that may not be the desirable result from a public policy perspective. While under most circumstances governments would want to have their legislative jurisdiction recognized and maintained to the greatest degree possible, which is the effect of the inconsistency test's tolerance of overlap, in the case of the provision of services, governments may be more interested in <i>not</i> maintaining jurisdiction over services which First Nations begin to provide pursuant to their own legislation. It is because of this
problem with the application of the traditional test of inconsistency that other approaches will have to be used to address overlaps in this area.
<p>
SOLUTIONS IN THE CHAMPAGNE AND AISHIHIK FIRST NATIONS SELF-GOVERNMENT AGREEMENT AND IN THE <cite>SECHELT ACT</cite>
<p>
This problem was identified in the course of the negotiation of the self-government agreement for the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations and other Yukon First Nations. The more difficult issue was how to deal with the problem in a way that recognized the legal and administrative challenges that were raised.
<p>
The solution that was developed for the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations self-government agreement is set out in ss. 13.5.3 through 13.5.7 of that agreement. These provisions were intended to address the problem of overlaps between laws of the Yukon government and the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations. Although
these provisions apply to all possible cases of overlap under the self-government agreement, they were in the main developed in response to concerns about overlapping laws related to the provision of services to citizens of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations by the First Nations and by the Yukon government. The sections in
question read as follows:
<blockquote>
13.5.3 Except as provided in 14.0, a Yukon Law of General Application shall be inoperative to the extent that it provides for any matter for which provision is made in a law enacted by the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations.
<p>
13.5.4 Where the Yukon reasonably foresees that a Yukon Law of General Application which it intends to enact may have an impact on a law enacted by the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, the Yukon shall Consult with the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations before introducing the Legislation in the Legislative Assembly.
<p>
13.5.5 Where the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations reasonably foresees that a law which it intends to enact may have an impact on a Yukon Law of General Application, the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations shall Consult with the Yukon before enacting the law.
<p>
13.5.6 Where the Commissioner in Executive Council is of the opinion that a law enacted by the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations has rendered a Yukon Law of General Application partially inoperative and that it would unreasonably alter the character of a Yukon Law of General Application or that it would make it unduly difficult to administer that Yukon Law of General Application in relation to the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, Citizens or Settlement Land, the Commissioner in Executive Council may declare that the Yukon Law of General Application ceases to apply in whole or in part to the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, Citizens or Settlement Land.
<p>
13.5.7 Prior to making a declaration pursuant to 13.5.6, the Yukon shall:
<blockquote>
13.5.7.1 Consult with the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations and identify solutions, including and amendments to Yukon Legislation, that the Yukon considers would meet the objectives of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations; and
<p>
13.5.7.2 after Consultation pursuant to 13.5.7.1, where the Yukon and the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations agree that the Yukon Law of General Application should be amended, the Yukon shall propose such amendment to the Legislative Assembly within a reasonable period of time.
</blockquote></blockquote>
It may be seen that these provisions combine a legal approach---a variation on the test of inconsistency---with an
administrative approach---consultation by the Yukon government with the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations on legislative initiatives, combined with a power to declare that laws of general application enacted by the Yukon Legislative Assembly do not apply to the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations and their citizens and settlement lands. 
<p>
Section 13.5.3 can be seen as an attempt to modify the normal test of inconsistency in an attempt to make it more likely that Yukon laws of general application will be rendered inoperative with respect to the First Nations. Instead of stating that the Yukon laws would be &quot;inoperative to the extent of inconsistency&quot; with First Nations laws (which is the normal test of inconsistency), this section says that a Yukon law is &quot;inoperative to the extent that it provides for any matter for which provision is made in a law enacted by the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations.&quot;  Therefore, the test is not whether there is conflict between the two laws. Rather, the test is whether First Nations laws provide for the same matter. In essence, this section attempts to change the methods used by the courts in sorting out overlapping jurisdiction, through the imposition of an occupied field test in the place of the inconsistency test. The effect, of course, would be to make it more likely that Yukon government laws would be found to be inapplicable in circumstances where the First Nations had exercised their law-making powers to provide a service or program. This was intended to make it less likely that there would be a problem with  duplication of services offered by the government and the First Nations.
<p>
However, it was recognized in the negotiation of the agreement that this broader test of conflict between the laws may still not address all of the potential problems that could arise. A serious concern was the possibility that the First Nations could exercise their legislative jurisdiction piece-meal, enacting statutes that addressed very limited aspects of certain fields. The consequence of this would be that the Yukon laws of general application would continue to apply to most of the aspects of the given matter, but would be rendered inoperative here and there by the
First Nations' laws. This was seen as a potential problem with respect to enforcement of regulatory-type laws, and with respect to the implementation and administration of services and programs under Yukon laws. 
<p>
Therefore, other provisions were added in order to make it less likely that problems would be created in legislation, and to provide the Yukon government with greater flexibility in addressing problems that did arise. Sections 13.5.4 and 13.5.5 were intended to ensure that the two jurisdictions consulted one another on their legislative agendas, so that each would be aware of the other's plans and would be able to consider the possible impact on their own legislative schemes. It was also intended that each jurisdiction would consider the possible impact on the other in designing the law that was to be enacted, and would thus identify means of dealing with potential concerns related to implementation and administration of programs and services. In this case, this avenue for control of problems of overlap is in the hands of the legislative branches of the Yukon government and the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations.
<p>
However, it was felt that even the combination of the broader test of conflict between laws and the consultation provisions may not be adequate to deal with problems caused by overlapping jurisdiction and laws. Therefore, ss. 13.5.6 and 13.5.7 were added to provide a further level of control, in this case in the hands of the executive. These sections allow the Yukon government to unilaterally decide that its laws will cease to apply to the Champagne and
Aishihik First Nations, their lands and their citizens. This would operate through a declaration by the Yukon's Commissioner in Executive Council.<sup><a href="#sixty4">64</a></sup> Section 13.5.6 imposes certain restrictions on the discretion of the Commissioner in Executive Council to make such a declaration: the Commissioner in Executive Council must be of the opinion (a) that the Yukon law has been rendered inoperative in part and (b) that this would change the effect of the Yukon law unreasonably or that this would make it too difficult to administer the law effectively. Only if both those conditions were met, in the opinion of the Commissioner
in Executive Council, would it be possible to suspend the application of the Yukon law to the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, their lands and their citizens.
<p>
A further procedural restriction is imposed on the Yukon government's ability to make a declaration under s. 13.5.6: the government is obliged under s. 13.5.7.1 to consult with the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations before making such a declaration in order to try to identify other solutions to the overlap problem that are less drastic than that in s. 13.5.6, including potential amendments. In the event that the Yukon government and the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations decide that the problem can be dealt with through a change to the Yukon law in question, s. 13.5.7.2 then requires the Yukon government to introduce into the Yukon Legislative Assembly a proposal to make such an amendment to the Yukon law.
<p>
Of the three mechanisms set out in ss. 13.5.3, 13.5.4 and 13.5.6 for dealing with problems of overlap, the power of the Yukon government under s. 13.5.6 to declare laws inapplicable to the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations is perhaps the most notable for its potential breadth of application and for the considerable discretion that it vests, notwithstanding the consultative requirements, in the Yukon government. In the Yukon context, the demographic situation will provide a fairly strong check on any plans to exercise this power in an unreasonable manner---Yukon Indian people constitute between twenty-five and thirty percent of the territorial electorate. However, this sort of practical check on the possible misuse of such a power may not exist in southern jurisdictions where Indian people are a very small percentage of the population and hence have less effective political influence.
<p>
It may be noted that a similar provision exists in the <cite>Sechelt Act</cite>. Section 36 confers on the federal Governor in Council a power similar to that contained in s. 13.5.6 of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations self-government agreement. Section 36 reads as follows:
<blockquote>
36. The Governor in Council may, on the advice of the Minister, by order declare that the <cite>Indian Act</cite> or any provision thereof does not apply to
<blockquote>
(a) the Band or its members, or<p>
(b) any portion of Sechelt lands,
</blockquote>
and may, on the advice of the Minister, by order revoke any such order.
</blockquote>
Since this section deals only with the relationship between the <cite>Indian Act</cite> and the Sechelt Indian Band, however, its significance as a means of resolving overlaps in jurisdiction is much less than that of section 13.5.6 of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations self-government agreement.
<p>
The combination of legislative, judicial and administrative control mechanisms has advantages and disadvantages. The legislative approach set out in s. 13.5.3 has the advantage of placing the responsibility for control of legislative jurisdiction in the hands of independent arbiters. The judiciary would not have a vested interest in the outcome of decisions on overlaps in jurisdiction, in contrast to the legislators and the administrators. However, the disadvantage of relying on the courts to resolve this type of jurisdictional problem is that the approaches used by the courts may not be in accord with the needs of the parties or the fiscal, social and economic realities of the situation. Moreover, the test set out in s. 13.5.3 simply may not be capable of achieving the result needed in the case of overlaps with respect to powers and responsibilities to provide services. In addition, the actual wording of the test of overlap contained in s. 13.5.3 is broader and less concrete than the test of inconsistency, and means that there will be a greater element of judicial subjectivity involved in making determinations as to jurisdiction.
<p>
The legislative and administrative approaches both have the advantages of encouraging communication between the Yukon government and the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations as to their respective legislative agendas and their mutual interests in coordinating legislative initiatives. The disadvantage, especially with respect to the power to suspend the application of Yukon laws pursuant to section 13.5.6, is the potential for disagreement as to their proper use. The conditions set out in the section (&quot;altering the character&quot; of a Yukon law or making it &quot;unduly difficult to administer&quot; a Yukon law) are susceptible to varying interpretations, and furthermore the question of whether those conditions are satisfied is left to the discretion of the Yukon cabinet. While the demographic realities of the Yukon may provide an effective check on the abuse of this discretion, it may prove virtually impossible to rely on judicial supervision of the exercise of this discretionary power. 
<p>
What is interesting about these latter approaches, however, is that they recognize that the advent of self-government means that the traditional approaches to sorting out overlapping jurisdiction---judicial tests of legislative competence and inconsistency---may have to be modified or even supplemented by other approaches. These approaches demonstrate that a willingness to consider creative alternative approaches will be necessary in arriving at workable relationships between First Nations and the federal and provincial governments.
<p>
<h3>IV.  Summary and Conclusions</h3>

This article has provided a look at one of the key technical challenges associated with the negotiation and implementation of self-government arrangements in Canada. That challenge is related to the design of the interface between the existing orders of federal and provincial government and what I assume will be the new third order of government, the First Nations. In particular, the challenge is how to deal with new problems that will arise as a
result of the way in which self-government powers are defined.
<p>
The traditional approaches used by the courts today to address overlapping legislative jurisdictions were, obviously,
developed in the context of only two levels of government, with only limited overlap in their powers. Because of concerns about the roles of the courts with respect to the legislative branch of government, the approaches used by the courts in Canada have tended toward upholding legislation enacted by one level of government despite overlapping jurisdiction of the other level. The test of inconsistency in particular is extremely tolerant of overlap, to the extent that provincial legislation has been upheld despite the fact that in substance it duplicates federal legislation covering the same matter.
<p>
However, self-government powers are being defined in a new way. They are being defined under a paradigm which sees all legislative powers in Canada as having been allocated already to either the federal or the provincial level. Consequently, self-government powers will be overlaid on top of the existing division of powers, which means that a large degree of overlap---much greater than that between the federal and provincial levels---is almost inevitable. In addition, because First Nations may not have extensive land bases, it may not be possible or appropriate to limit
certain of their powers to the lands they control, as this would greatly reduce their ability to govern their own affairs and interests effectively. Therefore, powers have been defined which apply to First Nations' citizens wherever they may be, whether on or off First Nations' lands. This is of particular importance with respect to services, as First Nations' citizens will still have entitlements to services provided by the other levels of government as well.
<p>
These differences mean that the traditional test of inconsistency may not work appropriately when it is applied in such a different context. While the inconsistency test may still work well with respect to First Nations' regulatory powers, it is less capable of dealing with the issue of overlap with respect to services-related powers. This is because the inconsistency test tolerates a wide degree of overlap, and when it comes to services-related powers
overlap will be something that government and First Nations will probably want to avoid. Therefore, different approaches may have to be developed to deal with this type of overlap.
<p>
The Champagne and Aishihik First Nations self-government agreement provides an example of some different approaches that may be considered. The agreement sets out an expanded judicial test for overlap, broader than the usual test of inconsistency, and closer to an occupied field test. The agreement also sets out methods relying
on the legislative and executive branches of government in dealing with overlap. 
<p>
The Yukon government is required to consult with the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations before introducing into the Yukon Legislative Assembly legislation that may affect First Nations laws. This provides a mechanism for the law-makers to consider the potential impact of their actions on the other's jurisdiction, and will provide a means for preventing overlap problems from arising.
<p>
The Yukon government is also given the power to declare that provisions of its laws do not apply to the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, their citizens and their lands. This gives the executive branch the administrative discretion to deal with overlap problems by, in essence, ceding jurisdiction on the matter. While this power is discretionary and may be hard to supervise through judicial review, there are practical checks on the use of this power in the context of the Yukon where Indian people are a significant proportion of the electorate. Hence, this may prove to be an effective fall-back mechanism for dealing with overlap.
<p>
Whether any of these approaches may work in a southern Canadian context is difficult to assess. In the provinces, the constitutional position is more complicated with respect to jurisdiction over matters of interest to First Nations. In addition, the greater number of First Nations in the provinces in comparison to the Yukon means that addressing overlap may be more complex than in the Yukon. In addition, administrative solutions, such as the Yukon
government's discretionary power to withdraw its laws from application to First Nations, may not be easily or appropriately transportable to the south, where First Nations and their citizens have much less political influence and may therefore be more vulnerable to misuse of such a power. However, these administrative solutions illustrate the sort of creative approach that will have to be employed in the negotiation of self-government arrangements and in the accommodation of a new order of government within the Canadian constitutional framework.
<p>
There is an important role for the legal profession to play in coming up with innovative solutions to technical issues such as these which arise in the context of self-government negotiations. By addressing any technical obstacles that arise in these negotiations, the parties will be able to focus on the more important public policy issues of the scope and content of self-government powers. This may have the added benefit of reducing the costs, in both financial and human terms, of negotiating and implementing self-government arrangements for First Nations in Canada.

The text of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations land claims agreement and the self-government agreement uses the defined term &quot;final agreement&quot; to mean the land claims agreement, as distinct from the self-government agreement.

<p>
<li><a name="forty1"><cite>Sechelt Act</cite>, s. 14(g).</a>
<p>
<li><a name="forty2">These two powers provide</a> an interesting example of how certain subject matters may be dealt with differently in different self-government agreements. In this agreement, the Sechelt Indian Band has the power to make laws respecting the education of all Band members, but the power applies only on Sechelt lands. Under the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations self-government agreement, the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations have the power under s. 13.2.8 to provide education services to those citizens &quot;choosing to participate,&quot; but the power extends off settlement land and throughout the Yukon.
<p>
The Sechelt Indian Band's power to provide health services is limited to Sechelt lands, but applies to anyone on
Sechelt land (<cite>Sechelt Act</cite>, s. 14(i)). The comparable power for the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations applies only to Champagne and Aishihik First Nations' citizens, but extends off settlement land and throughout the Yukon (except for regulation of facilities off settlement land) (s. 13.2.3).
<p>
These show how First Nations' powers over similar subject matters may be defined in varying ways from one self-government agreement to another, depending on the circumstances of the negotiations and on the objectives of
each First Nation and the governments involved.

<p>
<li><a name="forty6">For example, the</a> Council is given the power to make laws respecting management of
natural resources on Sechelt lands, subject to the proviso that those laws provide standards and rights at least equivalent to those prevailing in British Columbia from time to time (Band Constitution, Part III---Laws, Division (1), s. 7). (s. 14(j)).
<p>
The Council also has the power to make laws prohibiting the sale, barter, supply, manufacture or possession of intoxicants on Sechelt lands. However, before the Council may make a law under this power, the law must first be assented to by a majority of members voting in a special meeting called to consider the proposed law (Band
Constitution, Part III---Laws, Division (1), s. 12).

<p>
<li><a name="forty8">It should be noted</a> that this analysis is based only on the types of narrowly defined
exclusive powers set out in section 13.1 of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations self-government agreement. If a wider range of more broadly defined exclusive powers were to be negotiated, it is possible that this analysis would have to be reconsidered, depending on the subject matters involved.
<p>
<li><a name="fifty">The section reads:</a>
<blockquote>
13.3 The Champagne and Aishihik First Nations shall have the power to enact laws <i>of a local or private nature</i> on Settlement Land in relation to the following matters... [emphasis added].
</blockquote>
<li><a name="fifty1">In</a> <cite>Hodge v. R.</cite> (1883--1884), 9 App. Cas. 117, the Privy Council recognized that matters that looked like a federal responsibility in one case could also look like a provincial responsibility in another. Noting that federal and provincial laws may affect the same subject matter, but for different purposes, the Privy Council stated that &quot;[t]he principle [illustrated] is, that subjects which in one aspect and for one purpose fall within sect. 92, may in another aspect and for another purpose fall within sect. 91&quot; (<i>ibid.</i> at 130). This &quot;double aspect&quot; doctrine has led to significant overlap in federal and provincial legislative powers.
<p>
<li><a name="fifty2">The</a> &quot;incidental effects&quot; doctrine recognizes that a law enacted by one
level of government can have effects on subject matters within the jurisdiction of the other level. This acknowledges the reality that it would be virtually impossible, given the way the powers in s. 91 and 92 are set out, to require that each law enacted by one level of government have no effects on subject matters within the other level's jurisdiction. There is an extensive case law on this point; see, e.g., <cite>A.G. (Quebec) v. Kellogg's</cite>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 211.

<h1>Protecting Workers' Reproductive Health: Lessons from Quebec and Other Statutory Regimes

<center><h3>ABSTRACT / <a  href="http://www.law-lib.utoronto.ca/law-review/utlr53-2/sarra.htm">Fulltext</a></h3></center>

Employees are exposed to numerous reproductive health risks in their employment.  Possible statutory remedies for these risks in human rights, health and safety, and workers' compensation legislation are analyszed.  Outside of Qu&eacute;bec, the legislative regimes do not appear to be effective in either reducing the level of risk, or allowing employees to protect their incomes if they decide to have a child while working for an employer whose workplace
contains risks.  In fact, these regimes are hardly ever utilized to address reproductive health issues.  Qu&eacute;bec, however, has a unique regime for the protection of pregnant and nursing employees.  An employee who produces a medical certificate is entitled to reassignment or paid leave while pregnant or nursing.  The Qu&eacute;bec legislation is widely utilized by employees.  The contrasting levels of utilization indicate that the problem in the rest of Canada is not there there no reproductive hazards, but rather, an effective statutory scheme is lacking.  One of the foundation blocks of such a scheme should be income protection for workers during times when they are most vulnerable to reproductive hazards.
<p>
Les travailleurs se trouvent expos&eacute;s &agrave; nombreux dangers dans le lieu d' emploi qui mena&ccedil;ent la sant&eacute; reproductive.  Les recours statutoires dans la Code sur des droits de la personne, la Loi sur la sant&eacute; et securit&eacute; au travail, et la Loi sur les accidents du travail sont analys&eacute;s.  Hors du Qu&eacute;bec, le r&eacute;gime statutoire ne semble &ecirc;tre efficace ni &agrave; r&eacute;duire le niveau du
danger, ni &agrave; proteger le salaire d'un/e employ&eacute;/e qui d&eacute;cide d'avoir un enfant pendant qu'il/elle travaille dans un lieu comportant des dangers &agrave; la sant&eacute; reproductive.  En fait, ces r&eacute;gimes ne sont que rarement utilis&eacute;s pour vindiquer le droit &agrave; la sant&eacute; reproductive.  Cependant le r&eacute;gime qu&eacute;becois  reste unique dans son protection des employ&eacute;es enceintes et
allaitantes.  Une employ&eacute;e avec un certificat m&eacute;dical tient le droit d'&ecirc;tre affect&eacute;e &agrave; des t&acirc;ches ne comportant pas de dangers ou &agrave; un cong&eacute; pay&eacute; pendant la grossesse ou l'allaitement.  Les employ&eacute;s qu&eacute;becois pont recours &agrave; la l&eacute;gislation.  La diff&eacute;rence entre les niveaux d'utilisation des recours statutoires au Qu&eacute;bec et dans le reste du Canada indique que le probl&egrave;me dans le reste du Canada est qu'il n'y existe pas de r&eacute;gime statutoire efficace pour r&eacute;pondre au probl&egrave;me des dangers r&eacute;productifs, et non pas qu'il n'y existe pas des dangers r&eacute;productifs.  Une caract&eacute;ristique fondamentale d'une r&eacute;gime statutoire efficace
devrait &ecirc;tre la protection du salaire pendant les p&eacute;riodes lorsque les employ&eacute;s sont le plus susceptibles aux menaces &agrave; la sant&eacute; r&eacute;productive.

La diff&eacute;rence entre les niveaux d'utilisation des recours statutoires au Qu&eacute;bec et dans le reste du Canada indique que le probl&egrave;me dans le reste du Canada est qu'il n'y existe pas de r&eacute;gime statutoire efficace pour r&eacute;pondre au probl&egrave;me des dangers r&eacute;productifs, et non pas qu'il n'y existe pas des dangers r&eacute;productifs. Une caract&eacute;ristique fondamentale d'une r&eacute;gime statutoire efficace
devrait &ecirc;tre la protection du salaire pendant les p&eacute;riodes lorsque les employ&eacute;s sont le plus susceptibles aux menaces &agrave; la sant&eacute; r&eacute;productive.</i>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

There is a rapidly growing body of American jurisprudence on the question of reproductive hazards in the workplace.<sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup> At the centre of debate is the relationship between women's rights to equal treatment in employment, the rights of both male and female workers to safe workplaces, and the legal obligations of employers whose workplaces employ substances or practices which are known or suspected reproductive hazards.<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup> In Canada, outside Quebec, there has been neither the same volume of litigation, nor the intensity of debate around these social and legal questions. Only in Quebec,
where specific measures have been enacted which grant rights to reassignment or paid leave, has there developed a jurisprudence on reproductive health risks.<sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup> This article explores the reasons for this, by examining the Canadian jurisprudence with respect to these issues in the various statutory regimes governing human rights, workers' compensation, and health and safety.
<p>
I suggest that the current patchwork quilt of statutory laws governing workplace reproductive hazards looks more like a &quot;crazy quilt&quot; than a co-ordinated and integrated pattern of laws. Crazy quilts made in rural Ontario at the start of the century were taken from the scraps of old clothing and sewn together in a haphazard
fashion, hence the name. Similarly, this article will demonstrate how the current regime governing reproductive health is a series of legislative measures, each enacted to meet the political exigencies of the time. The overall result is a statutory regime that fails to protect individuals from the adverse effects of reproductive hazards. A non-comprehensive statutory framework can arguably create multiple points of access for individuals seeking to enforce substantive rights, and can undoubtedly help generate different institutional outlooks, but this article will illustrate how these possible advantages are seriously outweighed by the failure of the regimes to provide comprehensive protection.
<p>
It is important to recognize that gains are slowly being made in both Canada and the United States in dismantling discriminatory policies which exclude women of child-bearing age from particular jobs which pose reproductive health risks.<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup> There is, however, no corresponding recognition in either legislation or social policy of the need to eliminate reproductive health risks for all workers. The lack of co-ordination and coverage between the various statutory regimes has meant that employees are needlessly and continually exposed to these hazards and their adverse health effects. In particular, the failure to enact legislation requiring pre-market testing of new substances creates a situation where workers pay for new economic and industrial advances with their health. Current health and safety laws, which grant the right to refuse unsafe work in jurisdictions other than Quebec, are not being utilized by affected employees to prevent exposure to reproductive health hazards. In contrast, under Quebec law, the right to reassignment or paid leave for pregnant or nursing
women is extensively utilized. Quebec law is unique in recognizing the need to provide alternatives to risky exposure, at the same time as protecting job security and income. The Quebec regime promotes public policy goals of equal access to the workplace and protection of workers who are most vulnerable to adverse reproductive health
effects. The higher level of utilization of the Quebec regime in comparison to regimes in the rest of Canada is not due to the fact that hazards do not exist elsewhere. Rather, the available income protection and job security provisions, as well as the way in which the burden of proof has been interpreted, fundamentally affect how
frequently statutory remedies are used.
 <p>
Part I of this article provides a brief overview of the types of reproductive health issues existing in the workplace. It seems clear that these risks exist for both women and men. This conclusion is reinforced by the findings of the recent report of the Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies, which discussed the extent of exposure of Canadian workers to reproductive health hazards.<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup> Yet the focus of both
research and litigation has been on the reproductive health risks for women, to the virtual exclusion of consideration of risks to males. This is because most of the litigation has dealt with these risks as human rights issues as opposed to issues of workplace health and safety.
<p>
Part II examines occupational health and safety laws that currently exist to protect employees from reproductive health hazards. The Quebec law which provides for preventive reassignment of work or leaves of absence for pregnant women or nursing mothers is examined in detail, as is Ontario legislation which provides workers with the
right to refuse unsafe work. I will discuss why the Quebec legislation is comparatively more successful in protecting reproductive health rights.
<p>
Part III then examines the human rights issues, most specifically, the right to equal treatment in employment and its tension with employer responsibility for reproductive health hazards in the workplace. The leading Canadian decision on this issue, <cite>Weins v. Inco Metals Co.</cite>,<sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup> is analyzed for its legal and social policy implications. <cite>Weins</cite> is particularly significant given the paucity of Canadian case law dealing with these issues. <cite>Weins</cite> will then be compared with the U.S. Supreme Court decision in <cite>Johnson Controls Inc.</cite>,<sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup> in order to assess the similarities and
differences.
<p>
Finally, the conclusion looks at recent developments and suggests some immediate and long term prospects for addressing the fragmented and ineffective regimes protecting reproductive health. This article discusses how the Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies, in its final report, failed to focus on many of the issues raised in this article and in its own background study. Finally, I propose strategies for future protection from workplace reproductive hazards, modelled on the Quebec experience.
<p>
<h3>PART I:   Overview of Reproductive Hazards in the Workplace</h3>

Over the past forty years, between 67,000 and 100,000 new chemicals and substances have been introduced into the
workplace.<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup> The health effects of many of these substances are completely unknown. Traditional toxicological studies rarely evaluated reproductive health effects.<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup> Only in some cases have the negative consequences of various levels of exposure been documented. In even fewer cases have laws or regulations been enacted to limit workplace exposure levels.
<p>
Within the broader framework of the health effects of new substances and procedures is the narrower question of reproductive health hazards in the workplace. Given the large number of women of child-bearing age in the Canadian workforce, it is surprising that more information is not available concerning either the number of women who work during pregnancy or the reproductive hazards they face during this period. Although precise numbers are not known, the fact that 58 per cent of mothers with children under age three were working in 1988, and 75 per cent of families with children this age had both parents working full-time, indicates that a high percentage of women are likely working during pregnancy and probably while continuing to breast-feed.<sup><a href =  #ten">10</a></sup> Few studies have been done on the impact of working upon conception and pregnancy. An early British study found that a woman's chance of bearing a healthy child was greater if she was not employed outside the home.<sup><a href="#eleven">11</a></sup> The study failed, however, to draw any conclusions about the causes of the higher risks for women working. The study also did not examine miscarriages, which may have revealed important information concerning issues of fertility and early embryo development. A study by the United States Public Health Service found as early as 1968 that 59 per cent of all women bearing a first child were employed during their pregnancy.<sup><a href="#twelve">12</a></sup> Today, more women work for more years in the labour force for reasons of economic necessity. In Canada, full-time women workers earn on average 40 per cent of the family income, and it is estimated, for example, that the number of two-parent families below the poverty line would increase by 78 per cent if women did not work.<sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup> Thus, it is likely that greater numbers of women are exposed to reproductive health risks during their reproductive years than when these early studies were conducted.
<p>
Workers have been increasingly exposed to chemicals, some of which  are now known to cause adverse health effects and to impair their reproductive capacity. For example, agricultural workers are exposed to pesticides, electrical technicians to polychlorinated biphenyl, and manufacturing and industrial sector workers are exposed to
benzene, lead, mercury, and vinyl chloride. Employees in the pharmaceutical industry are exposed to alkylating chemicals, and operating room nurses, anesthetists, and dental assistants to anesthetic gases. There are also adverse reproductive health effects associated with insufficient oxygen supply, such as the carbon monoxide hazards faced by road workers, traffic control personnel, and toll booth operators. Since women require 20 to 30 per cent more
oxygen and produce 30 per cent more blood during pregnancy, the susceptibility of both mother and fetus to chemicals through inhalation and the bloodstream is increased substantially. These substances are associated with a broad range of adverse health effects, including menstrual disorders, failure to conceive, spontaneous abortion, damage to the developing embryo or fetus, and post-birth defects, such as Down's syndrome.<sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup>
<p>
In addition to chemical risks, there are other work procedures and practices that create reproductive risks. Both ionizing and non-ionizing radiation and radio-active exposure pose a risk to dental and X-ray technicians.<sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup> Infectious diseases make hospital, chronic care, daycare, and social work occupations risky for those who are pregnant because of the possibility of exposure to measles, chicken pox, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and hepatitis B.<sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup> Those who handle raw meat or animals are at risk if they come into contact with toxic plasmosis, brucellosi, or some strains of herpes.<sup><a href="#seventeen">17</a></sup> More recently, studies have suggested that the design of work, the ergonomics, may be a reproductive risk for workers.<sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup> This would include work requiring heavy lifting, or work necessitating sitting or standing in a confined position for prolonged periods of time.<sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a></sup>
<p>
One issue is the danger to the health of both mother and fetus during pregnancy. Once a woman becomes pregnant, the most critical biological period is the first eight weeks of gestation. During this period, all the organ systems are established and thus are highly susceptible to outside influences.<sup><a href="#twenty">20</a></sup> Often, however, women are unaware that they are pregnant during this early period, and fetal damage may have occurred prior to taking preventive measures. In addition, many women who have given birth return to the workplace while they are still breast-feeding. Substances such as lead, mercury, cadmium, or pesticides can pass from the mother's bloodstream into the milk supply and cause detrimental health effects to the nursing child.<sup><a href="#twenty1">21</a></sup>
<p>
Recently, the federal Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies published research papers suggesting that the magnitude and range of occupational reproductive health hazards is likely much broader than historically defined. It suggests the following: 
<blockquote>
[T]he range of adverse reproductive outcomes runs along a continuum that moves from disorders causing delay or lack of conception (i.e. menstrual disorders, hormonal problems, impotence, sperm abnormalities, uterine fibroid, tubal occlusions) to adverse effects on pregnancy (e.g. toxaemia, spontaneous abortions), to adverse birth outcome (e.g. stillbirth, low birthweight, congenital abnormalities).<sup><a href="#twenty2">22</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The Royal Commission's mandate was to spend four years researching and reporting on current medical and scientific developments in reproductive technology, including the causes and prevention of infertility. Its goal was to provide direction for public policy, and to make practical recommendations to enhance public awareness and facilitate public participation in the future of reproductive technologies.<sup><a href="#twenty3">23</a></sup> In the fifteen volumes of research studies prepared for the Commission, only two studies out of all of the copious volumes actually deal with occupational hazards. Yet the Commission estimated, based on American figures, that roughly 1.5 million Canadian workers may be exposed to potentially harmful chemicals and substances in the
workplace, with an unknown number facing reproductive health risks. It divided the reproductive risks into five categories of possible causes of adverse effects: chemical, physical, biological, psychological (stressors), and ergonomic. It found that there is an &quot;urgent need&quot; to undertake a comprehensive research program, and
recommended studying environmental and occupational health hazards, collecting data, and monitoring exposure levels.<sup><a href="#twenty4">24</a></sup>
<p>
Many substances have not yet been studied and their possible ill-effects are not known. One ethical problem that the background study for the Royal Commission identified is that the scientific community requires an extremely high standard of proof before it will declare a substance to be a reproductive hazard, and, in the interim, employees bear the risk of uncertainty until hazards are definitively proven.<sup><a href="#twenty5">25</a></sup> The difficulties of lack of research and information about workplace reproductive hazards are compounded for men.
<p>
THE FOCUS ON PROTECTION OF FEMALE RATHER THAN MALE WORKERS
<p>
Exposure to chemicals and other substances in the workplace has an effect upon the reproductive capacity of both men and women, yet very little research has been undertaken with respect to the detrimental health effects on groups other than pregnant women.<sup><a href="#twenty6">26</a></sup> In part this may be due to
historical notions that child-bearing and resulting health issues exclusively affected women.<sup><a href="#twenty7">27</a></sup> A major problem is that there is no requirement to test the reproductive hazards of chemicals or other substances <i>before</i> they are introduced into the workplace. Although both impotence and sterility have been documented, the more complex or subtle effects of exposure to particular chemicals or practices are virtually unknown. Stellman notes that although half the genetic material contributing to the fertilized egg comes from the male sperm, the effect of workplace hazards on male genes is usually overlooked.<sup><a href="#twenty8">28</a></sup> She argues that substances which cause mutations in female sex cells can also cause mutations in male sex cells, citing the documented effects of radiation, X-rays, excessive heat, lead, benzene, kepone, and cadmium as examples of substances which lead to increased impotence and possible genetic defects in offspring.<sup><a href="#twenty9">29</a></sup> Williams is also critical of the lack of research studies on male reproductive risks.<sup><a href="#thirty">30</a></sup>
<p>
The paucity of studies on reproductive health effects for male workers has had direct implications for their legal rights. In many health and safety and human rights adjudicative decisions, the explicit premise is that since reproductive health risks cannot be eliminated entirely, the risk must be balanced against the possibility of occurrence and extent of harm in order to determine &quot;tolerable&quot; levels.<sup><a href="#thirty1">31</a></sup> The legal question often posed is one of relative risk. Yet the known occupational risks to a pregnant woman's fetus will almost always be higher than the risk to the male reproductive system, given the accelerated adverse health effects on rapidly developing cell structures and organ systems.<sup><a href="#thirty2">32</a></sup> Thus, when rights to protection are adjudicated as relative risk, the protection of male workers will always fall short of the protection afforded to pregnant workers. Given that the health risks for men are so poorly documented, adjudicators do not concern themselves with the protection of male employees where the evidence is inconclusive.<sup><a href="#thirty3">33</a></sup>
<p>
As a result, there is little jurisprudence in Canada with respect to male reproductive hazards and the legal rights and remedies which may be available. In Ontario, for example, there are no published health and safety decisions on male workers seeking to enforce their right to a workplace free from these risks. If male workers were to seek this enforcement, the lack of medical evidence would work to minimize any rights they may possess. In Quebec, a male worker who can medically document that his health has deteriorated because of exposure to a workplace contaminant can request reassignment to duties he is reasonably capable of performing, until his health improves or the working conditions conform to regulatory standards.<sup><a href="#thirty4">34</a></sup> The problem with this provision is that he must demonstrate that his health has already deteriorated, which means, in the case of
reproductive hazards, that the damage has already been done. There is no preventive protection. Furthermore, in Quebec, as in other provinces, the regulatory standards for exposure levels to particular substances rarely address the issue of reproductive hazards, particularly for male workers.
<p>
The American situation is similar in that there are few medical studies or judicial decisions on male reproductive rights. In the landmark decision <cite>Johnson Controls</cite>, the U.S. Supreme Court granted women equal access to jobs with exposure to lead.<sup><a href="#thirty5">35</a></sup> Yet one of the class action complainants was Donald Penney, a male who had been denied a leave of absence for the purpose of lowering his blood lead levels so that he would be able to have children.<sup><a href="#thirty6">36</a></sup> Although the Court noted the debilitating effects of lead on the male reproductive system and thus found that Johnson's policy of excluding only women of child-bearing age from hazardous positions did not really work to protect the unconceived children of all its employees, it failed to grant a remedy for Penney's complaint.<sup><a href="#thirty7">37</a></sup> It thus failed to craft a remedy which protected all employees who may wish to conceive children.
<p>
The failure to address issues of male health risks is in part a result of the fact that reproductive health issues have been largely litigated as human rights issues. Thus, decisions are made in the context of access to employment for women, not the health and safety of workers. Employer policies which exclude women of child-bearing age from hazardous positions are speculated to exclude women from more than 100,000 jobs in the United States  alone.<sup><a href="#thirty8">38</a></sup> As will be illustrated in Part III, anti-discrimination laws provide an easier avenue for workers seeking to enforce their rights than health and safety laws, which do not expressly provide protection against reproductive hazards. Part II undertakes a comparative examination of Quebec's preventive health and safety regime, and its effectiveness in comparison with the limitations of the Ontario statutory framework. 
<p>
<h3>PART II:   Health and Safety Laws</h3>

One of the difficulties with the current statutory regime is that it is like a &quot;patch-work&quot; quilt of legislative protection, each law addressing a very specific issue such as human rights, health and safety or workers' compensation, patched together with little co-ordination to ensure comprehensive protection of employees. Similarly, employer compliance with the patch-work of laws is designed to meet each separate exigency of each law, without an overall vision or strategy to truly make workplaces accessible and safe. Health and safety legislation is a good example of the problems created by this fragmentation.
<p>
Health and safety laws are designed to prevent industrial disease and accidents, and have rarely focused specifically upon reproductive health hazards. In some jurisdictions, regulations exist to limit exposure to the most toxic substances. However, these exposure levels are designed to weigh relative risk against the work process being done. There are no regulations providing for zero exposure to reproductive health hazards, and there is no Canadian legislation which grants any worker the right to be reassigned during the period that she or he seeks to conceive children.
<p>
In most jurisdictions, health and safety laws impose an obligation upon employers to take reasonable precautions to protect workers.<sup><a href="#thirty9">39</a></sup> Little jurisprudence exists on the success of these legislative provisions, and even less on the issue of reproductive health hazards. In addition to the employer's
responsibility to provide a safe and healthy workplace, there are employee rights to refuse unsafe work. In this article, only the Ontario statutory regime of right to refuse unsafe work is examined, but a review of jurisprudence in other jurisdictions reveals little difference from the Ontario experience. In stark contrast, Quebec has a unique regime for the protection of pregnant and nursing employees which is widely used by employees. This part examines why Quebec has a much more effective statutory regime for preventing reproductive adverse health effects in the workplace.
<p>
QUEBEC: PREVENTIVE REASSIGNMENT OR HEALTH LEAVE FOR PREGNANT AND BREAST-FEEDING WORKERS
<p>
In Quebec, workers who are pregnant have the right under provincial health and safety legislation to reassignment to safe job tasks or to paid preventive leave from their work, if the job that they are performing is hazardous to their health. Section 40 of the <cite>L.S.S.T.</cite> provides that a pregnant worker can furnish her employer with a medical certificate which documents that her working conditions create physical danger for her unborn child, or that
working conditions create a danger to the woman's own health due to her pregnancy.<sup><a href="#forty">40</a></sup> The employer must then attempt to accommodate the worker by reassigning her to work tasks which do not pose a danger to her or the fetus, and which she can reasonably accomplish.<sup><a href="#forty1">41</a></sup> If such accommodation is not possible, she is entitled to a paid preventive leave from the time the medical certificate is presented until the end of the pregnancy. She is to be paid her regular salary for the first five days, and then 90 per cent of her regular net pay for the rest of her pregnancy.<sup><a href="#forty2">42</a></sup>
<p>
This right to paid preventive leave for pregnant workers is unique to Quebec. There is no such protection in any other provincial health and safety legislation. As of June 1993, the federal government introduced amendments to Part III of the <cite>Canada Labour Code</cite> providing for maternal reassignment for pregnant workers or nursing mothers. If an employer cannot &quot;reasonably practicably&quot; reassign the worker to alternative work, however, the employee must take a leave without pay.<sup><a href="#forty3">43</a></sup> Although the employee's job is guaranteed, the reality is that without full economic protection, this is at best a half measure, and women will be unlikely to take advantage of the law if reassignment does not seem possible. This is borne out by the fact that more than a year after the statutory amendment, the federal government has no documented cases of its use, and has stated that it does not expect that the right will be exercised very often.<sup><a href="#forty4">44</a></sup>
<p>
Significantly, where laws grant strong protective rights with economic security, pregnant workers have exercised these rights frequently. In the first seven years after the Quebec provisions were enacted, claims for protective reassignment or leave rose from zero to 14,337 claims annually.<sup><a href="#forty5">45</a></sup> In
1993 the number of women who exercised the right to preventive reassignment or paid leave rose to 20,009, and 18,642 of these claims were upheld by the Quebec Workplace Health and Safety Commission.<sup><a href="#forty6">46</a></sup> It is also one of the few jurisdictions in Canada where case law has developed in any significant way with respect to reproductive health issues.
<p>
The Quebec law has its limitations. Since it expressly applies to pregnant workers, the Quebec law does not cover or provide protection for those women who are exposed to hazards at the time of conception. Since most workers cannot verify that they are pregnant for at least four weeks (a critical period in fetal development), the law affords
no protection at a very crucial stage of pregnancy. There can also be problems associated with any delay in getting a medical certificate, since each day of exposure to a hazardous substance early in pregnancy may put a woman's health at risk. The protection also does not apply to the period prior to conception, when exposure to hazards can critically affect the possibility of subsequent conception or the healthy progress of the pregnancy. Similarly, the
law does not cover male workers who plan to have a family and who wish to be removed from working conditions which may be hazardous to their capacity to reproduce, or which may harm their sperm.
<p>
Despite these limitations, the Quebec regime has been very effective in providing economic and health protection to pregnant and nursing employees. It is helpful to examine some of the leading cases in order to assess the treatment of pregnant workers under this protective legislation. When there are disputes between the pregnant worker and the employer, there are three levels of administrative decision-making. The first level is the Commission de la sant&eacute; et s&eacute;curit&eacute; du travail du Qu&eacute;bec (C.S.S.T., the Health and Safety Commission), the second is an appeal to the Bureau de r&eacute;vision (B.R.P., the Office of Review). Finally, parties are entitled to a full hearing before the Commission d'appel en mati&egrave;re de l&eacute;sions professionnelles (the Appeals Tribunal) whose decisions are final and binding.<sup><a href="#forty7">47</a></sup> The decisions of the Appeals Tribunal are useful to examine for purposes of this article.
<p>
The cases to date have clarified limits upon the <cite>L.S.S.T.</cite>'s protection. First, the preventive reassignment and leave protection is available only to workers who come within provincial health and safety laws. Those workers employed in a federal undertaking are not eligible, even if the work they perform appears to be within provincial jurisdiction.<sup><a href="#forty8">48</a></sup> Second, the provisions do not cover employers, supervisors, forepersons or employees who represent employers in labour relations matters.<sup><a href="#forty9">49</a></sup> Third, the rights do not exist for workers who are laid off during their pregnancies. The
Appeals Tribunal has held that the right to paid leave is secondary to the right to reassignment of work tasks, and that where the right to work no longer exists, there is no right to paid leave.<sup><a href="#fifty">50</a></sup>
<p>
Where a worker does utilize the protection of the provisions, however, the case law has developed to maximize the protection and remedies available. The medical certificate from the doctor is taken as <i>prima facie</i> proof that a danger to the pregnant woman and her unborn child exists, at least until such time as a full hearing on the merits of a case is heard.<sup><a href="#fifty1">51</a></sup> This removes a potential barrier for employees seeking to enforce their rights---namely, the inevitable delay surrounding litigation and appeals.
<p>
The weight given to the doctor's certificate helps redress the existing imbalance in power and resources between worker and employer, and helps expedite efforts to resolve the issue of possible reassignment or paid leave. It is the doctor who decides the capacity of the pregnant worker to undertake the work safely, not the employer. As a result, delay is prevented by immediately moving from a determination of whether the hazard exists, to a determination of
how will it be accommodated.<sup><a href="#fifty2">52</a></sup>
<p>
The Appeals Tribunal has accorded protection under s. 40 for biological hazards, chemical hazards, and ergonomic hazards. For example, in <cite>H&ocirc;pital Sainte-Justine v. Marie-Dominique Cossette</cite>,<sup><a href="#fifty3">53</a></sup> the issue was whether a pregnant nurse who had a medical certificate for preventive reassignment had been sufficiently accommodated by the employer. At issue was whether workplace exposure to cytomegalovirus (CMV) was more hazardous than the hazard posed by exposure to the general population, and thus whether she was entitled to paid preventive leave instead of reassignment. CMV is a known teratogen which is transmitted through saliva, urine, maternal milk, sperm, and genital secretions. The hospital had reassigned the
nurse to the day nursery, but she complained that the reassignment still presented a reproductive danger. Among her duties, the nurse was required to care for infants, including changing diapers. The employer argued that with proper hygiene standards, there was no greater risk to the worker or her unborn child than was presented by
exposure to the general population.
<p>
The Appeals Tribunal decided that the worker was justified in contesting the reassignment to the post of nursery nurse.<sup><a href="#fifty4">54</a></sup> It held that intimate contact was required in order to contract CMV and the risk was slight, but that upon contracting the virus, the health risks to the fetus were very grave, resulting
in either deformity or death.<sup><a href="#fifty5">55</a></sup> The Tribunal found that, although the risk of contracting CMV for hospital workers was the same as for the general population, for the worker whose child dies or is born deformed, the effects are devastating.<sup><a href="#fifty6">56</a></sup> It held that the provisions of the statute are exceptional measures designed to extend more protection to pregnant workers than to the average worker, and to that end, the provisions are to be interpreted in a large and liberal manner. As long as the pregnant worker demonstrates that there is a possible danger to herself or her unborn child, she should be accorded the protection of the law.<sup><a href="#fifty7">57</a></sup>
<p>
The decision is significant for several reasons. It is a clear statement by the administrative tribunal that has ultimate
responsibility for these complaints that the statute will be given a purposive interpretation in order to protect the health of women. In the <cite>Cossette</cite> case, the result was that, although there was no greater risk in the workplace than in the general population, the existence of any risk was sufficient to invoke the protection of the
statute. The worker was truly granted preventive protection. The threshold set by the Tribunal ensured greater protection than there would have been if this case involved compensation for the effects of such exposure after the fact. For a compensation claim, it is likely that the existence of an equivalent risk of exposure in the general population would have led to failure to establish any causal link between the workplace conditions and the resulting harm.
<p>
Second, the Appeals Tribunal looked at two possible interpretations of &quot;danger&quot; to the worker and the unborn child. The Tribunal found that the law requires that the employee's reassignment must eliminate the danger, not merely reduce it.<sup><a href="#fifty8">58</a></sup> In the case before it, the Tribunal did not find proof that there was no danger of contracting CMV through the nurse's work duties, and given the grave consequence of contracting the virus during pregnancy, she was entitled to full protection.<sup><a href="#fifty9">59</a></sup> The legal standard set by this decision places an onus upon the employer to demonstrate that the work reassignment poses no danger to the worker or fetus. In shifting the onus away from the pregnant worker and creating a &quot;no danger&quot; standard for the employer to meet, the Tribunal granted the broadest possible protection.
<p>
The Tribunal has also recognized chemical hazards, such as the solvents involved in the silkscreen printing process, and found that paid leave is necessary in these cases in order to protect the unborn child.<sup><a href="#sixty">60</a></sup> In <cite>Dyan Royer v. Sheraton Laval</cite><sup><a href="#sixty1">61</a></sup> the Tribunal held that a discotheque worker was entitled to preventive leave because the carbon monoxide fumes from the discotheque posed a health hazard to her unborn child. The Tribunal found that the testing undertaken to
determine carbon monoxide levels was &quot;single site&quot; testing and not an adequate sampling, but it held that this would not be a bar to protection. The documented health effects of carbon monoxide fumes causing lower birthweights and increased risk of abortion or perinatal death, combined with test readings well above the acceptable level for exposure for a worker, warranted granting the benefits.<sup><a href="#sixty2">62</a></sup> This decision appears to give the benefit of the doubt to the worker where the testing is not adequate, but the health risks are high.
<p>
With respect to ergonomic hazards, the Tribunal has found that a pregnant woman performing visual inspection and packaging of electrical sockets was entitled to preventive leave. It found that the requirement for the woman to work in a stationary position and press her stomach against a work table in order to accomplish the work tasks constituted a health hazard.<sup><a href="#sixty3">63</a></sup> The employer's modifications of the work station were found to be inadequate to reduce the risk to the fetus, and any further adaptation was not possible because it would slow down the production line. Further, the Appeals Tribunal considered that the fact that the worker was paid on a piece-work basis posed difficulties with further modifications. Thus, it found that she had
the right to the paid preventive leave.<sup><a href="#sixty4">64</a></sup>
<p>
The Tribunal's identification of piece-work pay as one factor to be considered in determining whether the workplace can be adequately adapted to reduce the risk of harm is interesting. In a contrasting decision, the Tribunal found that the accommodation made to a sewing-machine operator, in allowing for additional breaks, was sufficient accommodation by the employer in the context of stationary working conditions. It appeared significant to the Tribunal that the operator was to be paid henceforth by the hour instead of by piece, thus ensuring that the rate of production was not a health risk to the pregnancy. She was therefore denied paid preventive leave.<sup><a href="#sixty5">65</a></sup> It is not clear whether her income level was actually guaranteed by the work accommodation and adjustment to an hourly rate of pay.
<p>
Where the reassignment of work is found to pose no danger to the pregnant woman, and where the Appeals Tribunal finds that she can reasonably accomplish the job tasks, the Tribunal will deny the request for paid leave. For example, in the case of a hospital worker who successfully established that her job of lifting patients and other heavy work was hazardous, the employer assigned her to receptionist-switchboard. Although she argued that this work was too difficult for her and created enormous stress which was detrimental to the pregnancy, the Tribunal found she was not entitled to leave because the work was a reasonable reassignment, and stress was not one of the hazards for which she had originally received the medical certificate.<sup><a href="#sixty6">66</a></sup>
<p>
The Quebec law also provides protection for nursing mothers. Articles 46 and 47 of the <cite>L.S.S.T</cite> are aimed at preventing the mother's exposure to a substance from creating hazards for the nursing infant. These provisions specify that if a worker furnishes the employer with a medical certificate which attests to the fact that her working conditions are a danger to her nursing child, she is entitled to a reassignment which is not hazardous to the health of her nursing baby, and which she can reasonably perform. If such a reassignment is not immediately possible, she is entitled to a leave until such time as non-hazardous work is available or until she has finished nursing.<sup><a href="#sixty7">67</a></sup> This right is seen as a separate and distinct right under the
statute, and a woman who is breast feeding must apply again for coverage under these sections.<sup><a href="#sixty8">68</a></sup> It appears, however, that if she has already established the health hazards during the
pregnancy, particularly chemical hazards, that the medical proof for the continuation of preventive leave is a formality.<sup><a href="#sixty9">69</a></sup>
<p>
In <cite>&Eacute;velyne Desmarais v. Centre d'accueil Anne le Seigneur</cite><sup><a href="#seventy">70</a></sup> the Appeals Tribunal concluded that an educational worker who was working with
severely mentally disabled children was not exposed to a sufficient risk of biological hazards that she was entitled to the protection afforded by ss. 46 and 47 of the <cite>L.S.S.T</cite>. The Tribunal found that she was at fairly high risk of contracting hepatitis B and herpes, and some risk of other infections such as AIDS. It concluded, however, that there was virtually no risk to the nursing infant, particularly if the mother's milk was pumped and administered
to the infant without any physical contact with the mother.<sup><a href="#seventy1">71</a></sup> The Tribunal acknowledged that the working conditions jeopardized the continued ability of the mother to maintain nursing, because there was no safe place for the extraction of breast milk in the workplace. The Tribunal noted that,
although this seems deplorable, it did not fall within ss. 46 and 47 which were designed to prevent the dangers of transmission of illness through nursing, not to prevent working conditions which endangered the ability to breast feed.<sup><a href="#seventy2">72</a></sup>
<p>
This decision appears to make an artificial distinction which contradicts the purpose of these statutory provisions. It found that the law does not protect workers from working conditions that jeopardize their ability to nurse, leaving the door open for employer arguments that any hazardous working condition merely endangers the ability to nurse, not the health of the child. There is not yet adequate case law on this point to determine whether or not this decision was an anomaly.
<p>
The fact that more than 20,000 Quebec women are now annually exercising their rights to preventive reassignment or leave to avoid reproductive health hazards, stands in stark contrast to the rest of Canada where the statutory right to refuse unsafe work is not being utilized to protect employees against the adverse health effects of workplace reproductive hazards.
<p>
ONTARIO: THE RIGHT TO REFUSE WORK FOR REPRODUCTIVE HAZARDS
<p>
In Ontario, the <cite>Occupational Health and Safety Act</cite> (<cite>O.H.S.A.</cite>) gives workers the right to refuse work they believe is likely to endanger themselves or other workers.<sup><a href="#seventy3">73</a></sup> This includes any equipment, machine, device or thing they are likely to operate, as well as the physical condition of the workplace. Once a worker exercises her or his right to refuse the unsafe work, a series of procedures are activated which attempt to resolve the complaint, including an investigation by health and safety representatives, and if necessary an inspection and an order from a Ministry of Labour inspector.<sup><a href="#seventy4">74</a></sup> Where an employer or an employee is not satisfied with the result of an inspector's finding, he or she has the right to a hearing before an adjudicator with the Office of  Adjudication.<sup><a href="#seventy5">75</a></sup>
<p>
Given this statutory framework, it is interesting that there are virtually no recorded cases of work refusals due to reproductive hazards.<sup><a href="#seventy6">76</a></sup> There are a few documented cases of work
refusals, including inspector's orders. At the adjudicative level, however, there is only one decision in the province of Ontario regarding a work refusal and reproductive hazards.<sup><a href="#seventy7">77</a></sup> That case
involved VDT operators at Old City Hall in Toronto, and the adjudicator found that the complaint was justified in so far as the miscarriage rate was three times the normal level. The adjudicator chose not to make any order, however, until further study was carried out by the University of Toronto, and there is no further decision as to the outcome of this additional research.
<p>
In <cite>General Motors and United Autoworkers Local 222</cite>, an arbitrator who held that a policy which did not equally exclude male workers from exposure to lead was not discriminatory, wrote in <i>obiter</i> that in his view, male workers in their reproductive years would have the right to refuse.<sup><a href="#seventy8">78</a></sup> Thus, the arbitrator did not address the concerns raised by male workers. Instead he placed the onus upon those individuals to exercise their individual right to refuse unsafe work. Yet the <cite>O.H.S.A.</cite> right to refuse unsafe work has been legislation for fifteen years, and to date, there are no published cases on the right to refuse because of reproductive hazards (except the VDT case noted above).<sup><a href="#seventy9">79</a></sup> From what little has been documented, where work refusals take place, they have not been upheld by Ministry of Labour inspectors.<sup><a href="#eighty">80</a></sup> It is often only where unions have intervened, generating attention in the media and the legislature, that the government has moved to clear up some reproductive health hazards, not through legal enforcement of the right to refuse.<sup><a href="#eighty1">81</a></sup> Similarly, although there is a right to refuse unsafe work under the <cite>Canada Labour Relations Code</cite>, including the right to reassignment pending resolution of a complaint, this right has not
been exercised in the context where an employee believes the work is unsafe for his or her reproductive system.<sup><a href="#eighty2">82</a></sup>
<p>
This failure to exercise these rights may be explained by looking at the informational and economic problems facing workers in such situations. As noted above, lack of information about reproductive hazards means that workers are not always in a position to decide a work practice or substance is likely to endanger their health. Second, although in Ontario the <cite>O.H.S.A.</cite> provides for the worker to be paid and reassigned pending the initial investigation of the work refusal, where the employer does not have alternative work available, the employee can be sent home without pay after the initial investigation, as long as the action is not a penalty or reprisal for exercising the right to refuse.<sup><a href="#eighty3">83</a></sup> Further, if the work refusal shuts down an entire production line or service, the other employees who have not technically &quot;refused&quot; are not entitled to
compensation for their lost work time under the <cite>O.H.S.A.</cite> Thus, a worker, in deciding to exercise her or his right to refuse for reproductive hazards, risks not only her or his own economic security, but that of co-workers. This risk is a strong incentive not to exercise the right.
<p>
There is, however, a recent decision of the Office of Adjudication which may have an impact upon the ability of pregnant women or other workers to refuse unsafe work. In <cite>Canadian Autoworkers v. American  Healthcare</cite>,<sup><a href="#eighty4">84</a></sup> the Office of Adjudication, which now adjudicates on issues arising out of the <cite>O.H.S.A.</cite>, explicitly altered long-standing health and safety policy by deciding that the right to refuse could no longer be judged by the &quot;average worker.&quot;  Previously, complaints were judged on this standard, with adjudicators finding that the <cite>O.H.S.A.</cite> was fashioned &quot;to protect the `average worker' from a dangerous work environment and not the worker with special needs arising out of the physical condition of the worker.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty5">85</a></sup>
<p>
In contrast, in <cite>American Healthcare</cite>, the adjudicator found that the legislation dealing with the right to refuse requires an objective standard in assessing the worker's belief that a situation is hazardous, and the physical condition of the particular worker in the situation is relevant to an objective assessment.<sup><a href="#eighty6">86</a></sup> The adjudicator used the example of a worker with allergies who refuses to enter a work area  because even minimal exposure would have serious health consequences. Under the new test, the worker would be entitled to refuse, and an adjudicator would be hard pressed not to conclude that the work was hazardous to that particular worker.<sup><a href="#eighty7">87</a></sup>
<p>
The implications of the <cite>American Healthcare</cite> decision for reproductive health issues are obvious. Previously, a pregnant worker would not have been considered an &quot;average worker&quot; and her physical condition could not have been taken into account in assessing the work refusal. <cite>American Healthcare</cite> opens up the possibility for assertion of these kinds of rights. The pregnant worker would still have to establish that she refused based upon an objective test of her reasonable belief, but her reasonable belief would be assessed from the perspective of her physical condition. To date, however, there has been no further jurisprudence on this question.
<p>
A more interesting question is whether male or female workers who are trying to conceive children would also be able to take advantage of this shift in the jurisprudence. For example, consider the situation where a male is exposed to lead during work, yet is actively seeking to have children. Would the right to refuse accommodate his refusal as a &quot;hopeful father&quot; based upon his reasonable belief that further exposure would be hazardous to his reproductive ability?  Similarly, would a woman seeking to conceive have the right to refuse, if as a concerned &quot;future mother,&quot; she reasonably believes some substance or work practice to which she is exposed is hazardous to her reproductive capacity?  Both would face difficulties in asserting their claim.
<p>
Part of the difficulty for any worker seeking to enforce her or his rights is that health and safety laws have not to date been interpreted in the large and liberal fashion, the way most remedial statutes are supposed to be interpreted.<sup><a href="#eighty8">88</a></sup> Rather, health and safety legislation has been interpreted
as balancing worker health and safety against employer economic interest, and the approach gives equal weight to both.<sup><a href="#eighty9">89</a></sup> The effect of this interpretive approach has generally been not to uphold a worker's health and safety concern unless there is an explicit standard or regulation enacted which applies to her or his situation.<sup><a href="#ninety">90</a></sup> Given that it will be many more years before standards are established for most toxic substances, few workers will be able to effectively utilize existing health and safety laws to protect their reproductive health. 
<p>
The same might be said with respect to current laws which provide workers with the &quot;right to know&quot; about toxic substances in the workplace. Great strides have been made in the past decade in legislating rights to information and training in the identification and handling of hazardous workplace substances.<sup><a href="#ninety1">91</a></sup> This ostensibly includes reproductive hazards. Given, however, that there has been so little research on the reproductive health effects of workplace substances, and given that there is no requirement for pre-market testing of possible reproductive health effects of such substances, this right to know is necessarily limited to disclosure of the information the manufacturer possesses. Thus the right to know, while potentially very effective, is of limited value until manufacturers are required to undertake more testing and research.
<p>
 A background study for the Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies also confirms the failure of government to use existing enforcement mechanisms effectively. For example, it points out that under the Ontario health and safety legislation, manufacturers and suppliers of new biological or chemical agents must give notice to
the Ministry of Labour prior to their introduction into the workplace. The Director of Health and Safety has the power to order an assessment of the health effects if she or he suspects they are hazardous. Since this provision was enacted, however, there have been 819 notifications of new agents, but no manufacturer or supplier has been ordered to conduct an assessment of potential reproductive hazards.<sup><a href="#ninety2">92</a></sup> Similarly, Fudge and Tucker point out that existing powers to prohibit use of a toxic substance in a specific work location have never been exercised for protection of reproductive health.<sup><a href="#ninety3">93</a></sup>
<p>
WHY THE QUEBEC PROTECTIONS RESULT IN A MORE COMPREHENSIVE USE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS
<p>
The Quebec law is, without a doubt, being utilized in a much more comprehensive fashion than the right to refuse unsafe work in other jurisdictions, or the right to reassignment under federal laws. It would appear that there are three reasons for this. First, adjudicators have made it very clear that the rights granted under the statute will be interpreted in such a way as to promote the public policy goals of fully protecting women's reproductive health
rights.<sup><a href="#ninety4">94</a></sup>
<p>
Second, the Quebec Appeals Tribunal has held that where there are two competing notions of danger to the pregnant worker, and where no proof is submitted that there is no danger, the Tribunal will uphold a woman's right under the law even if the risk in the workplace is no greater than in the population at large.<sup><a href="#ninety5">95</a></sup> By placing the legal onus upon the employer to show that there is no danger, the law has facilitated the use of the right to reassignment and preventive leave. Since employees rarely have the resources or
information to fully document or challenge reproductive health hazards, this interpretive approach has shifted the burden away from those with the least information, thus enhancing their protection under the legislation. In contrast, in other provinces, once a work refusal is investigated by an inspector, the onus shifts to the worker to prove the reasonableness of the refusal, and often she or he does not have adequate information or resources to discharge this onus.
<p>
The third reason is likely an economic one. The Quebec law, by guaranteeing either reassignment or paid leave, ensures that lost income does not become a determining factor in whether a woman will exercise reproductive health rights. This grants much more protection than the federal law which protects wages and benefits only where the employer finds that reassignment is possible.<sup><a href="#ninety6">96</a></sup> In other jurisdictions, although workers could be compensated for time pending disposition of a work refusal on a reproductive health complaint, this benefit is not entrenched in the law. Thus, seeking compensation pending the decision often becomes as onerous as eliminating the hazard. Given the huge disparity in the use of health and safety laws for
reproductive protection (no cases in Ontario versus more than 20,000 each year in Quebec), it would appear that express statutory protection, guaranteed income protection, and employer onus are all critical factors in determining whether laws can be used to provide reproductive health protection.

<h3>PART III: Human Rights Perspective</h3>

EQUAL ACCESS AND THE TENSION WITH EMPLOYER  RESPONSIBILITY FOR REPRODUCTIVE HAZARDS
<p>
The continued existence of reproductive risks raises the question of whether employer policies which restrict pregnant women or women of child-bearing age from particular jobs are discriminatory within the meaning of Canadian human rights law.
<p>
There currently exists an elaborate human rights regime, articulated in both federal and provincial human rights laws, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. Section 15(1) of the <cite>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite> also guarantees that every individual is equal before and under the law and includes the right
to equal protection and benefit of the law without discrimination.<sup><a href="#ninety7">97</a></sup> These laws protect women's equal access to the workforce. Yet this human rights regime exists concurrently with the scheme of health and safety laws designed to foster safe and healthy workplaces by placing obligations upon employers to take all reasonable precautions to protect their employees. Employer policies seeking to conform to the latter create a tension with laws protecting equal access to employment. Thus, from the perspective of human rights legislation, the question is whether policies seeking to exclude particular classes of workers because of reproductive health hazards represent sex discrimination.
<p>
<cite>WEINS v. INCO METALS CO.</cite>
<p>
The first major case in Canada was the decision by the Ontario Human Rights Boards of Inquiry in <cite>Weins</cite>.<sup><a href="#ninety8">98</a></sup> Inco operated a nickel refinery in which it recovered
pure nickel using a pressure carbonyl process. Although the plant was considered to have extremely safe equipment and work practices, there was some danger of exposure from occasional leakages. Nickel carbonyl gases, if ingested through inhalation, pass through the bloodstream and most membrane tissues, and can cause chemical poisoning from both the nickel and the carbon monoxide released into the bloodstream. It can negatively affect cells in both their functioning and their duplication.<sup><a href="#ninety9">99</a></sup> Given the rapid cell development of the fetus, this exposure could have serious health consequences for a pregnant worker.
<p>
Inco instituted a policy that women of child-bearing age would not be permitted to work in virtually any of the jobs in the plant.<sup><a href="#onehundred">100</a></sup> Its rationale was based on the potential health hazard to unborn children from both the nickel carbonyl and the antidote medication given upon exposure. The complainant, Ms. Weins, argued that the policy was discriminatory.
<p>
The Board of Inquiry considered the complaint, which spanned over the period of both the old <cite>Ontario Human Rights Code</cite><sup><a href="one01">101</a></sup> and the amended <cite>Code</cite> which came into force in June, 1982.<sup><a href="one02">102</a></sup> Section 4(1) of the pre-1982 <cite>Code</cite> provided that no person could refuse to train, promote, transfer, or exclude from employment any person because of their sex. The 1982 amendments included the provision that every person has the right to equal treatment with respect to employment without discrimination because of sex.<sup><a href="#one03">103</a></sup> It also prohibited a person from either directly or indirectly infringing upon these
rights.<sup><a href="#one04">104</a></sup> Section 10 of the <cite>Code</cite> provided:
<blockquote>
10. A right of a person under Part I is infringed where a requirement, qualification or consideration is imposed that is not discrimination on a prohibited ground but that would result in the exclusion, qualification or preference of a group of persons who are identified by a prohibited ground of discrimination and of whom the person is a member, except where,
<blockquote>
(a) the requirement, qualification or consideration is a reasonable and bona fide one in the circumstances; or
<p>
(b) it is declared in this Act that to discriminate because of such a ground is not an infringement of a right.
</blockquote></blockquote>
The Board of Inquiry in <cite>Weins</cite> decided that the exclusion of women of child-bearing potential constituted discrimination on the basis of sex. The decision was a landmark not only in that it was the first such Canadian case involving equal treatment in regard to access to potentially hazardous jobs, but it also departed from the existing Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence in <cite>Bliss v. Attorney General of Canada</cite>.<sup><a href="#one05">105</a></sup> In <cite>Bliss</cite>, the Court had held that different treatment of pregnant women was not sex discrimination under federal human rights law, since pregnant women are treated differently because they are pregnant, not because they are women.<sup><a href="#one06">106</a></sup> In contrast, the Board in <cite>Weins</cite> found that discrimination can still exist even if not all members of the class are affected, in other words, even if not all women get pregnant.<sup><a href="#one07">107</a></sup>
<p>
Subsequent to the <cite>Weins</cite> decision, the Supreme Court of Canada in <cite>Brooks v. Canada Safeway Ltd.</cite> found that <cite>Bliss</cite> was wrongly decided, holding that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy is a form of sex discrimination.<sup><a href="#one08">108</a></sup>
<p>
There are a number of difficulties with the approach taken in the <cite>Weins</cite> decision, however. First, the Board in <cite>Weins</cite> found that discrimination would be permitted in cases where the employer can demonstrate a &quot;reasonable and bona fide qualification&quot; (&quot;RBFQ&quot;). It suggested that this should be dealt with on a case by case basis under the <cite>Human Rights Code</cite>.<sup><a href="#one09">109</a></sup> On the specific facts, it was held that the exclusion of women of &quot;child-bearing potential&quot; as well as the exclusion of pregnant women at the nickel carbonyl plant constituted <i>prima facie</i> sex discrimination under both the old and the new <cite>Code</cite>.<sup><a href="#one10">110</a></sup> The Board's approach shifts the focus of the employer's attention, however, to
establishing a &quot;reasonable and bona fide qualification&quot; defence to exclusionary policies instead of eliminating reproductive health risks for all its employees. The underlying premise is that reproductive hazards will continue to exist without serious challenge, and the only question is which employees must face these hazards at a given time.
<p>
Thus employers have a statutory defence to discriminatory practices available to them under human rights statutes. Once discrimination is established, under s. 10(a) of the <cite>Code</cite>, the onus shifts to the employer to establish that the discriminatory employment practice excluding all women of child-bearing potential is a RBFQ. The Supreme Court has held that there is both a subjective and an objective test in assessing reasonable and bona fide qualification.<sup><a href="#one11">111</a></sup> The subjective test is that the policy:
<blockquote>
must be imposed honestly, in good faith, and in the sincerely held belief that such limitation is imposed in the interests of the adequate performance of the work involved with all reasonable dispatch, safety and economy, and not for ulterior or extraneous reasons aimed at objectives which could defeat the purpose of the Code.<sup><a href="#one12">112</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The Supreme Court also found that there is an objective test for evaluating the performance, in that:
<blockquote>
it is reasonably necessary to assure the efficient and economical performance of the job without endangering the employee, his fellow employees and the general public.<sup><a href="#one13">113</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The Board in <cite>Weins</cite> followed the reasoning in <cite>Rand</cite> and the Supreme Court in <cite>Etobicoke</cite> in finding that the employer had the onus to demonstrate the policy met both
tests.<sup><a href="#one14">114</a></sup> In addition, the Board found that an employer has a duty to accommodate employees, with the onus upon the employer to establish undue hardship before a successful defence against accommodation can be made out.<sup><a href="#one15">115</a></sup> The Board found that Inco's policy was enacted in good faith, but that its policy of differential treatment did not relate in an objective sense to the performance of the work.<sup><a href="#one16">116</a></sup> It was not reasonably necessary to protect the fetus, nor was it necessary to the efficient performance of the job.<sup><a href="#one17">117</a></sup>
<p>
The second problem with the decision is that the Board failed to dismiss the idea that a RBFQ could include exclusions from certain jobs based upon the fact of pregnancy alone.<sup><a href="#one18">118</a></sup> The Board held that the risk of endangering a fetus due to an employer's activity is a matter of concern for the employer as well as the worker. By framing the issue as one dealing with the competing interests of worker's freedom of choice, society's interest in the well-being of children, and the employer's interest in avoiding possible civil liability to a deformed child,<sup><a href="#one19">119</a></sup> the Board opened the door for ongoing arguments
and employer defences to exclusionary policies. A more effective approach would have been to place a positive onus on employers to demonstrate that men and their children are not adversely affected by the substances women are excluded from being exposed to. This approach has previously been endorsed in the United States.<sup><a href="#one20">120</a></sup> Instead, the Board in <cite>Weins</cite> found only that there must exist a real and
significant risk for a restrictive policy to be &quot;reasonable.&quot;<sup><a href="#one21">121</a></sup> On
the facts, the Board found that the policy was not reasonable because of the safety measures in place, the infrequency of gas leaks, and the availability of good birth control.
<p>
The result of <cite>Weins</cite> is that the employer has the duty to accommodate women of child-bearing age unless to do so would constitute undue hardship. The Board dismissed the employer's argument that it could suffer financially from accepting the risk of employing women of child-bearing age.<sup><a href="#one22">122</a></sup> Interestingly, the Board stressed the fact that the employer's liability under other statutes was extremely limited. Although the Board appears to be trying to reassure the employer, it speaks legends about the failure of the existing statutory regime to truly protect workers. For example, the Board suggested that since the
employer had conformed to existing health and safety regulations, there was little risk of prosecution under the <cite>O.H.S.A.</cite>.<sup><a href="#one23">123</a></sup> Similarly, it held that the employer would
not risk higher workers' compensation claims because adverse health effects are spread over the industrial class and there are no direct cost consequences.<sup><a href="#one24">124</a></sup> Finally, the Board acknowledged that the employer did face some risk of being sued in tort, since the <cite>Ontario Family Law Act</cite><sup><a href="#one25">125</a></sup> gives a child a right to sue for pre-natal injury. It found, however, that the possibility of success was highly unlikely, and therefore, it did not justify a policy of exclusion for fear of a
lawsuit.<sup><a href="#one26">126</a></sup> Thus <cite>Weins</cite>, while finding that an exclusionary policy was discriminatory, also legitimized considerations such as protection of the fetus and legal liability of employers as defences to exclusionary policies, where such considerations do not affect the ability of the employee
to perform the work. As well, there was no discussion of the elimination or reduction of exposure as part of any accommodation required by the employer.
<p>
OTHER RELEVANT CANADIAN DECISIONS
<p>
<cite>Weins</cite> continues to be a significant decision because there are almost no other cases in Canada which deal with these human rights issues. In <cite>General Motors</cite>, an arbitrator rejected the union's assertion that failure to protect male workers from the negative effects of lead exposure violated the anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement.<sup><a href="#one27">127</a></sup> General Motors' policy of excluding all women, but not men, of child-bearing age was upheld as reasonable given the medical evidence related to fetal exposure to lead.<sup><a href="#one28">128</a></sup> The arbitrator went beyond permitting the exclusion of only pregnant women to uphold the exclusion of all women of child-bearing age. The decision, which predates <cite>Weins</cite>, is inconsistent because the medical evidence relating to lead exposure makes no distinction
between men and women of child-bearing age.
<p>
The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal has departed from the <cite>General Motors</cite> case, and concluded from medical evidence that male and female workers are affected to the same extent in their reproductive capacity from exposure to lead. It held, however, that the fetus was at greater risk of being harmed at much lower levels of
exposure through the bloodstream, and that a baby is at greater risk from lead in the breast milk after birth.<sup><a href="#one29">129</a></sup> The practical result of these decisions is that an employee may or may not have access to human rights remedies, depending on the jurisdiction under which the complaint arises, and the particular adjudicator who hears the complaint. Such a hit-and-miss approach creates further uncertainty about the
availability of protection.
<p>
In <cite>Cassan et al. v. Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co. Ltd.</cite>,<sup><a href="#one30">130</a></sup> the Tribunal found that a policy of excluding women capable of bearing children from smelter positions and thus from lead contaminants was <i>prima facie</i> sex discrimination.<sup><a href="#one31">131</a></sup> Although the policy was directed towards the risks associated with fetal exposure, it was
nevertheless a policy directed towards the employment of women. As a consequence, the Tribunal held that the employer's policy of granting women equal treatment in the workforce only on the condition of, and at the price of, denying their role as mothers constituted sex discrimination.<sup><a href="#one32">132</a></sup> It adopted an approach  similar to <cite>Weins</cite> that such cases must first involve an inquiry into whether the practice is discriminatory, and then an assessment of whether the practice can be justified as &quot;reasonable and bona
fide.&quot;<sup><a href="#one33">133</a></sup>
<p>
One of the few other cases on point is <cite>Heincke v. Emrick Plastics</cite>. It is a recent Ontario human rights decision which involved a pregnant worker exposed to solvents from spray paints. She was denied a work reassignment to a less hazardous job during her pregnancy.<sup><a href="#one34">134</a></sup> The Board
of Inquiry held that although there was some controversy as to the precise toxicity of the solvents, the employer had violated the <cite>Human Rights Code</cite> by discriminating against her because she was pregnant. Forcing Ms. Heincke to take a leave for the duration of her pregnancy instead of reassigning her to a less hazardous job was a
failure to fulfil the employer's duty to accommodate her pregnancy. As a remedy, the Board ordered payment of all the lost wages of the worker. Significantly, it also ordered general damages of $3,000 because she was forced to return to work only six weeks after birth as a result of requiring her to take the early leave. The award recognized she had suffered from the inability to spend her maternity leave with her daughter, and that she had to forego nursing. Finally, the Board held that a collective agreement provision which requires all pregnant workers to commence their maternity leave at six months, regardless of their ability to continue to do their work, was sex discrimination and contrary to the <cite>Code</cite>.
<p>
The significance of this decision is the explicit recognition that employers have a duty to reasonably accommodate pregnant workers under the <cite>Code</cite>. Employers will be liable for a breach of this duty, and may be required to pay general damages. The difficulty is that the right to protection for this employee was upheld long after the pregnancy and birth of the child, and thus is not an expeditious or preventive remedy. It remains to be seen whether this decision will be used by human rights officers in an effort to expedite resolution or enforcement of future cases.
<p>
COMPARISON WITH <cite>JOHNSON CONTROLS</cite>
<p>
It is instructive to compare the results of litigation on exclusionary employer policies in Canada with those in the United States. The leading case in the United States is <cite>Johnson Controls</cite>,<sup><a href="#one35">135</a></sup> a class action which challenged an employer policy excluding all women of child-bearing age, except those who could medically prove infertility, from jobs which involved exposure to lead. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the policy was overt sex discrimination because it required only women to provide medical proof of sterility, despite the medical evidence that lead exposure negatively affects male as well as female
reproductive systems. The policy of excluding women of child-bearing capacity was found to be sex discrimination under <cite>Title VII</cite> of the <cite>Civil Rights Act</cite>, as amended by the <cite>Pregnancy Discrimination Act</cite>,<sup><a href="#one36">136</a></sup> unless that capacity prevents a woman from performing those duties of her job which fall within the &quot;essence&quot; of the particular business.<sup><a href="#one37">137</a></sup>
<p>
The Court held that if a policy is found to be facially discriminatory, the business necessity test is not applicable.<sup><a href="#one38">138</a></sup> Further, it does not matter why the employer implemented the policy, because the absence of malevolent motive does not correct a discriminatory policy.<sup><a href="#one39">139</a></sup> The statutory defence of &quot;bona fide occupational qualification&quot; must show that the reason for the discrimination is that it affects the employee's ability to do the job, and is reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the business.<sup><a href="#one40">140</a></sup> The safety exception to this defence to a sex discrimination claim was found to be limited to cases where the pregnancy or sex of the worker actually interferes with the employee's ability to perform the job. Here, fertile women were able to do the job as well as anyone else.<sup><a href="#one41">141</a></sup> Finally, the Court held that it is not for the courts or the employer to decide whether a woman's economic role is more important than her child-bearing role; decisions about the health of future generations is a matter for the parents who conceive, bear, support, and raise children.<sup><a href="#one42">142</a></sup>
<p>
The U.S. Supreme Court has been very explicit that the &quot;bona fide occupational qualification&quot; is a very narrow defence. The requirement is that the policy must be reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business, imposing an objective standard which must relate to job specific skills and aptitudes.<sup>,a href="#one43">143</a></sup> Third party considerations only apply where it goes to the core of performance of
the job and the essential purpose of the enterprise.<sup><a href="#one44">144</a></sup>
<p>
<cite>Johnson Controls</cite> serves as a useful comparison in the development of jurisprudence related to reproductive health rights. Although the content of the laws differs, both Canadian and American adjudicators have developed similar jurisprudence and remedies. Both have recognized that policies excluding women of child-bearing age are prima facie discriminatory, and both acknowledge that the only real defence to such policies is the bona fide occupational qualification argument. The American case law is stronger in two respects, however. First, American courts have placed greater emphasis on the narrowness of this defence. Second, the U.S. Supreme Court has made a clear statement of policy that decisions about child-bearing are matters for parents, not employers. This is a stark contrast to <cite>Weins</cite>, which legitimizes the employer's role in such decision-making.
<p>
Both Canadian and American jurisdictions have adopted a purposive approach to the meaning of sex discrimination, including pregnancy within its ambit, but interestingly, have ordered almost no remedies to reduce or remove reproductive hazards for all workers. The recognition of a woman's choice to have access to the economic
benefits of industrial jobs or to have children is an important confirmation of equality rights. It is disturbing, however, that women are seen to be able to choose one or the other, but not both. In fact, for most women and men, the options are not one or the other; they need and desire to secure a decent income and job security while being able to raise a family. This involves ensuring the safety of children from conception through child-rearing. Given
that reproductive health cases are largely litigated as human rights cases, these issues have not yet been adequately dealt with by courts in either Canada or the United States. Decision-makers have limited themselves to a narrow notion of equality, which is reflected in remedies that do not require making the workplace safe.
<p>
Neither regime has used what Beatty would characterize as the &quot;least drastic means&quot; approach to deciding whether policies excluding women from particular jobs are discriminatory.<sup><a href="#one45">145</a></sup> In other words, where an employer has implemented an exclusionary policy, ostensibly for <i>bone fide</i> occupational reasons, the question should be whether there is a means to accomplish
the employer's objectives, of ensuring a healthy and productive workforce which is less detrimental to the equality rights of those persons excluded. Thus in cases like <cite>Weins</cite> or <cite>Johnson Controls</cite>, the test would be whether the employer had made all reasonable efforts to implement alternate engineering and control
strategies before implementing exclusionary strategies. 
<p>
There is some support for this approach in existing Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence in human rights. In <cite>Brossard (Ville) v. Qu&eacute;bec (Commission des droits de la personne)</cite>,<sup><a href="one46">146</a></sup> the Supreme Court found that an anti-nepotism policy of a municipality was made in good faith and was rationally connected to the objective of avoiding conflicts of interest in employment of public servants, but that it was disproportionately stringent.<sup><a href="#one47">147</a></sup> The appellant, Laurin, was the daughter of a woman who worked as a secretary in the police station. She applied for a summer job as a life guard and was ineligible to be considered because of her familial relationship (called her civil status) to a full-time employee of the town.<sup><a href="#one48">148</a></sup> The Supreme Court held that the exclusionary policy was too drastic in that it excluded situations such as this where there could be no abuse of power or conflict of interest. It thus found that the policy was discriminatory and could not be supported by the defences under the Quebec <cite>Charter</cite>.<sup><a href="#one49">149</a></sup> This approach, which interprets BFOQ requirements strictly, and requires employers to implement less drastic employment policies, has obvious application to reproductive health issues. Exclusionary policies for reproductive hazards would become a strategy of last resort, only after employers had explored less drastic means of controlling exposure. Engineering safety controls, or substitution of less harmful substances for harmful ones, would support both the goals of
reducing exposure to hazards and equal access to employment, as well as meeting the employer's objective of a safe and efficient workforce.
<p>
Dayton has argued that by framing the fetal protection issue as one of conflicting rights between mother and fetus, we are inviting resolution of the conflict by denying employment opportunities in favour of fetal  protection.<sup><a href="#one50">150</a></sup> Sally Kenney points out that the mere term &quot;fetal
protection policies&quot; is highly paternalistic on the part of employers and renders women invisible, &quot;mere vessels that may contain a fetus.&quot;<sup><a href="#one51">151</a></sup> As Grover has pointed out, however, in striking down Johnson Controls' fetal protection policy, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the worker's interest in employment takes precedence over the company's defence of the well-being of future generations.<sup><a href="#one52">152</a></sup> It is not yet known whether the woman's interest is absolute, or whether in particular circumstances, other interests will override it.<sup><a href="#one53">153</a></sup> These and other feminists argue persuasively that the issue should not be framed as one of equality versus the
right to have healthy children, and that by posing the issues as a dichotomy, we fail to develop more comprehensive strategies to address workplace reproductive hazards.<sup><a href="#one54">154</a></sup>
<p>
Swinton discusses the &quot;perils of protection,&quot; in that stereotyping of women has led to policies which are protective of their child-bearing capacity to the exclusion of their role as workers. She argues that women have the right to be regarded as more than child-bearers, and at the same time, there must be policies which protect women from financial hardship because they are barred or have refused to work in risky jobs.<sup><a href="#one55">155</a></sup> The Board in <cite>Weins</cite> acknowledged that competing with the freedom of choice of the worker is society's interest in the well-being of the child.<sup><a href="#one56">156</a></sup> Again, by juxtaposing the interests of mother and fetus as separate, the door is open to decisions which will override the woman's rights as both worker and decision-maker with respect to her unborn child. As Becker points out, the fact that employers have often been concerned with fetal protection policies in traditionally male-dominated workplaces, and not in women's work, suggests a discriminatory bias.<sup><a href="#one57">157</a></sup> In fact, traditional women's work poses many of the same kinds of reproductive hazards as I noted in Part I, but employers have not implemented discriminatory policies in those occupations.
<p>
TORT LIABILITY AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUALITY
<p>
These issues of equal access and protection from reproductive health hazards are complicated by the spectre of tort
liability in both Canada and the United States. There is not sufficient space to deal adequately with these issues in this article. It is important to note, however, that a claim of wrongdoing under the tort law regime is a private action, and there are significant barriers to bringing an action in tort. It is thus questionable whether or not such actions would act as an effective remedy to reproductive health effects or as an effective deterrent to future unhealthy workplace practices. Barriers include the difficulty in establishing causation, the enormous delays in the
legal system in actually hearing and deciding or resolving such claims, the high cost of bringing such actions in terms of both preparation for and conduct of the litigation, as well as the high costs that could be awarded against a plaintiff.<sup><a href="#one58">158</a></sup>
<p>
In the future, the issue of tort liability may, however, have some bearing on how cases of alleged discrimination are adjudicated in both Canada and the United States. In <cite>Weins</cite>, the Board found that employers may have an interest in avoiding liability costs from a tort action brought by a child suffering deformity or ill health
effects as a result of her mother having been exposed to workplace toxic substances and that this interest was a competing interest with women's interests in equality and freedom of choice.<sup><a href="#one59">159</a></sup> Although the Board did not decide the case based on this argument, by raising this as a competing interest, it left open the possibility of potential tort liability as a defence to discriminatory policies. 
<p>
In contrast, in <cite>Johnson Controls</cite>, the majority judgement of Blackmun J., joined in by four other Judges, saw no conflict between <cite>Title VII</cite> protection against discrimination and possible tort
liability because <cite>Title VII</cite> bans sex-specific exclusionary policies. The majority held that if an employer fully complies with the law, fully informs women employees of the risk, and has not acted negligently, under general tort principles any possible liability would be &quot;remote at best.&quot;  It did not find the tort liability argument persuasive, holding that the extra cost of hiring one sex was not a defence to discrimination. Employers cannot use sex discrimination to avoid the obligation to minimize reproductive hazards.<sup><a href="#one60">160</a></sup>
<p>
In <cite>Johnson Controls</cite>, however, the Court noted that the employer had not argued that it faced any actual costs from tort liability. The majority decision declined therefore, to decide the question of whether <cite>Title VII</cite> would pre-empt state tort laws, as it was not a question before the Court. The majority did note that since the extra cost of hiring women was not a defence to discriminatory hiring based on gender under <cite>Title VII</cite>, the fear of additional costs because of awards for tort damages was also not a defence.<sup><a href="#one61">161</a></sup> The concurring judgement by Justice White, with whom both the Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy joined, held, however, that a fetal protection policy would be justified if the employer could demonstrate that the exclusion of women from particular jobs was &quot;reasonably necessary to avoid substantial tort liability.&quot;  The concurring judgement strongly disagreed with the majority's decision to set a high threshold, requiring the costs to be so prohibitive as to threaten the survival of the business, and left open the possibility that an employer could establish a BFOQ cost-based defence.<sup><a href="#one62">162</a></sup> These judgements thus leave open the very real possibility that the Court would consider a cost-based BFOQ as a legitimate reason for utilizing discriminatory hiring policies. 
<p>
For both Canadian and American tribunals and courts, the question is: on what basis would such a defence be judged?  How would costs be calculated, and at what threshold would economic interests of the employer override fundamental issues of human rights? Although workers in most Canadian and American jurisdictions do not have the right to sue in tort because of the statutory bar to civil actions in workers' compensation regimes,<sup><a href="#one63">163</a></sup> a child born alive can sue in tort for pre-natal injury. Thus one issue for further debate is whether there are ever circumstances where the cost to employers from tort liability would outweigh the interests of the female workers.<sup><a href="#one64">164</a></sup> To date, the reality is that there has been virtually no success in bringing a successful tort action for pre-natal occupational injury, in part because of the difficulties in establishing causation.<sup><a href="#one65">165</a></sup> In Canada, there has never been a successful civil
action for reproductive harm caused by exposure to workplace hazards.<sup><a href="#one66">166</a></sup> Thus, it is important that tort liability issues not be used to justify broad exclusionary policies. Grover suggests that employers may seek to enter into contracts of indemnity with workers.<sup><a href="#one67">167</a></sup> In Canada, at least, mothers cannot forfeit the tort rights of their child for pre-natal injury. More importantly, such an approach fails to address the primary concern, namely, how to eliminate or minimize the exposure to reproductive
hazards for all employees. There is much debate about how a tort regime fits into the overall context of reproductive hazards. Issues identified in the background study for the Royal Commission on Reproductive Technologies include an analysis of the following: the precise nature of the duty of care owed by employers to employees; whether a more effective approach would be an action for trespass to the person and battery or an action for negligence; questions of how a litigant would establish proximate cause or remoteness of damage; and the defences of contributory negligence and voluntary assumption of risk.<sup><a href="#one68">168</a></sup>
Similarly, in Quebec, which has a civil law regime codifying wrongdoing for intentional and negligent harms, there are complex issues of how issues of foreseeability, reasonable care and prudence, as well as the causal connection between fault and damage are to be determined and measured.<sup><a href="#one69">169</a></sup>
Discussion of possible tort remedies, however, is a very complex topic, and far beyond the scope of this article. 
<p>
<h3>PART IV:   Workers' Compensation</h3>

EXISTING CASE LAW ON REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH EFFECTS
<p>
In Ontario, the only workers' compensation decisions which exist on the issue of reproductive health effects are those where another compensable injury, such as a back injury, has given a pregnant woman compensation, and the employer is seeking to reduce or negate the compensable injury because, as a pregnant woman, she is unavailable for work.<sup><a href  = "#one70">170</a></sup> There are no adjudicative decisions in Ontario workers'
compensation law with respect to compensation to women for the effects of reproductive hazards, such as miscarriages, or other health effects due to exposure to toxic substances.<sup><a href="#one71">171</a></sup> Similarly, although there are a number of decisions on male impotence, these are almost exclusively decisions arising out of on-the-job back injuries and resultant nerve damage, as opposed to any other reproductive health effect. Interestingly, these are all treated as sexual dysfunction cases, as opposed to injury to reproductive capacity.
<p>
With respect to pregnant workers, there have only been five adjudicative decisions in Ontario since the inception of the current workers' compensation regime which touch in any way upon workers' compensation and pregnancy. Almost all are decisions about whether the pregnancy reduces benefits for other compensable injuries.<sup><a href="#one72">172</a></sup> In one case, for example, a punch-press operator who had suffered a compensable back injury became pregnant and the original pain was aggravated by the recovery from childbirth. The Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal found that the worker was disabled due to the delivery and thus her back injury was not compensable for the post-birth recovery period.<sup><a href="#one73">173</a></sup> More recently, the Tribunal held that pregnancy does not automatically disqualify a worker from receiving a disability supplement, if the worker is available for work and co-operating in a medical or vocational rehabilitation program. On the particular facts of the case, however, compensation was denied.<sup><a href="#one74">174</a></sup> The difficulty is that it is unclear how the worker could meet the Tribunal's &quot;available and co-operating&quot; tests, given her ill health.
<p>
The Workers' Compensation Board has published guidelines for the temporary compensation of pregnant women where there is traumatic injury to the abdominal region, or where women miscarry due to hazardous work.<sup><a href="#one75">175</a></sup> As there are no tribunal decisions or published statistics, however, it is impossible to assess how frequently or easily women make use of this policy. Temporary compensation for this kind of injury is compensation for wage loss until recovery and does not address emotional suffering or other loss.
<p>
According to the Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal, the reason that there are virtually no cases relating to reproductive health effects is because of the difficulty in establishing causation.<sup><a href="#one76">176</a></sup> With so little documented information about workplace reproductive health effects, causation is difficult to establish in a legal or quasi-judicial forum. The increasing exposure to environmental
pollutants both on and off the job, as well as increased exposure to smoke, alcohol and drugs, all complicate the issue of causation.<sup><a href="#one77">177</a></sup> Furthermore, little is known about the reproductive health effects carried home by one partner in a relationship and transferred to the other through contact with contaminated clothing or skin, or by seminal fluids.<sup><a href="#one78">178</a></sup> Yet the Ontario
workers' compensation regime is premised entirely upon a causation model.
<p>
In Ontario, the Industrial Diseases Standards Panel is now studying reproductive health effects for the first time. It will likely be some time before the Panel reports, but it may start to document in a comprehensive way some of the devastating negative health effects of particular substances. The problem is that its statutory mandate is to make recommendations on compensatory illness to the Workers' Compensation Board; it does not have the mandate to propose preventive legislative measures based upon its findings.<sup><a href="#one79">179</a></sup> 
<p>
&quot;LOST EARNING CAPACITY&quot; LAWS AS A BAR FOR COMPENSATION FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH EFFECTS
<p>
With respect to the reproductive health cases relating to men, there have been nine cases relating to male impotence, and no other cases relating to reproductive health effects. Permanent partial disability pensions under the Ontario <cite>Workers' Compensation Act (W.C.A.)</cite>, however, are based upon impairment of earning capacity. In one case, the Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal found the impotence resulting from surgery to correct a
compensable back injury had not impaired the worker's earning capacity, and that the injury was not compensable.<sup><a href="#one80">180</a></sup> The Tribunal rejected an approach earlier adopted by the British Columbia Tribunal,<sup><a href="#one81">181</a></sup> and held that the &quot;link between impotence and an indirect impact on earning capacity is too tenuous and speculative&quot; to establish a basis for
compensation.<sup><a href="#one82">182</a></sup> The decision was overturned two years later, however, on a reconsideration application. On reconsideration, the Tribunal determined that there was evidence of a link between male impotence and impairment of work performance, and that the pension must represent the impaired earning capacity of the average worker instead of the individual, given that psychological problems resulting from
impotence likely affect ten per cent of earning capacity.<sup><a href="#one83">183</a></sup> Subsequent to this decision, lost earning capacity is to be examined only in cases where the individual alleges severe psychological impairment affecting greater than ten per cent of earning capacity. Female sterility cannot be compensated unless the employee can establish a causal connection between the sterility and lost earning capacity.<sup><a href="#one84">184</a></sup>
<p>
The Tribunal has thus acknowledged that impotence or sterility could result in a disabling psychological condition which can impair earning capacity.<sup><a href="#one85">185</a></sup> Compensable benefits defined under s. 45(12) of the <cite>W.C.A.</cite> define permanent disability as &quot;any physical or functional abnormality or loss, or any psychological damage arising therein after maximum rehabilitation has been achieved.&quot; The section as worded could be more liberally interpreted to include the psychological effects of impotence: on confidence, work performance, exercise of judgement, etc., which have a long-term impact upon earning capacity. It does seem unfair that the reproductive health effects of harmful working conditions are not compensable, except at a very high threshold of psychological damage.
<p>
In contrast, the jurisprudence in British Columbia held that a worker does not need to demonstrate an actual loss of earnings as a requirement for eligibility for compensation. The Tribunal has recognized the non-economic consequences of impotence and awarded compensation based upon a sliding scale of compensable benefits, from
15 per cent pensions to workers under age 45 to five per cent for those over age 65.<sup><a href="#one86">186</a></sup> Although this in part is accounted for by different statutory language, the B.C. Tribunal has also held that there may well be an indirect effect on earning capacity from feelings of inadequacy, depression, and lack of self-confidence, which should be considered.<sup><a href="#one87">187</a></sup> Similarly, in granting female workers 15 per cent of total disability awards for female sexual dysfunction following a workplace injury, the W.C.B. did not require a demonstrated loss of earnings.<sup><a href="#one88">188</a></sup>
<p>
Given that few reproductive adverse health effects can be shown to cause lost earning capacity, the formulation of workers' compensation legislation in Ontario largely acts as a bar to compensation for those effects. Unless a worker can demonstrate first that there exists a negative health effect, and second, that the effect actually impaired her or his earning capacity, then under existing laws, a permanent disability pension beyond very minimal compensation is rarely, if ever, available. Further, the workers' compensation regime is a comprehensive regime, which means that workers do not have the right to bring a civil action. Thus, it is a catch-22: reproductive
ill-health effects which can have an extraordinary impact on workers' personal lives, cannot be compensated without establishing lost earning capacity. Yet where there is no lost earning capacity, the regime is crafted such that there appears to be no legal recourse for compensation in civil law.
<p> 
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

LOOKING FORWARD: THE ROYAL COMMISSION REPORT
<p>
The federal Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies has issued its final report, <cite>Proceed With Care</cite>. It is most unfortunate that the Commission chose to ignore many of the pressing issues identified in this article. Only 8 of the 293 Commission recommendations address occupational reproductive health hazards in any way, and many of the recommendations suggested by its background study were not adopted.<sup><a href="#one89">189</a></sup> In part, this is due to lack of information on the precise scope and extent of workplace reproductive hazards, but it may also be due to the fact that the effects of health hazards are more visible than the causes. Thus, governments may perceive that it is easier to deal with these tangible effects rather than to identify the causes and eliminate the hazards at the source. Far more resources have gone into new technologies which try
to correct the results of workplace and environmental exposure, (i.e. infertility, impotence), than into creating safe workplaces which would prevent many reproductive problems in the future. The Royal Commission focused almost exclusively on the high-tech medical and technological industries which are curative as opposed to preventive.
<p>
The Royal Commission did make a few important recommendations, however, which could assist the federal and provincial governments in looking forward to what needs to be done to minimize reproductive risks. The Commission started from the explicit premise that no work environment can be absolutely safe, but that the balance of risks and costs (to health, to the environment and the financial costs to employees and the employer's competitive advantage) must be factored into the setting of standards or the design of workplace controls. It made four key recommendations. First, hazards must be reduced through workplace design and controls at the source, rather than
through discriminatory policies. This reinforces some of the human rights decisions discussed earlier, but goes a step further to recommend a positive obligation to put engineering controls in place to reduce exposure to reproductive hazards. Although the Commission did not make a formal recommendation, it notes that governments have failed to use existing enforcement powers and urges them to do so to ensure compliance where regulatory standards do exist.<sup><a href="#one90">190</a></sup>
<p>
Second, the Commission endorsed existing experience-rated workers' compensation systems, where employer contribution rates are set based upon experience of injury or illness, and recommended expanding these provisions to use penalties as incentives to reduce reproductive hazards. Third, the Report recommended building upon the existing W.H.M.I.S. system to promote information sharing and move towards establishment of uniform standards for exposure to reproductive hazards. Finally, it recommended that provinces and territories amend their health and safety legislation to conform to the Quebec regime, which vests real decision-making power in joint employee-employer health and safety committees. This would include requiring employers to obtain committee approval of any major workplace changes and providing external resource supports for non-unionized joint  committees.<sup><a href="#one91">191</a></sup> This is a fairly important recommendation for a Royal Commission to make, because legislative change granting real power to joint committees would begin to allow employees some control in eliminating reproductive health risks. Workers who are required to bear the economic, emotional, and physical costs of reproductive health hazards have a direct interest in the decision-making which affects their safety.
<p>
 The Royal Commission ignored many of the substantive findings, however, and failed to adopt the proposals of one of the background studies which comprehensively examined the need for legislative change in this area.<sup><a href="#one92">192</a></sup> The study by Fudge and Tucker examined the current tort regime and its relationship to reproductive issues, assessing current limitations and liabilities, as well as its limited utility in
eliminating reproductive health risks.<sup><a href="#one93">193</a></sup> It also argued that while economic incentives should be utilized through Workers' Compensation administration, employees should not be compensated for pain, suffering, loss of consortium or other non-economic loss. It suggested that the harm caused by reproductive hazards is inestimable, and trying to place a price on loss of reproductive health &quot;cheapens them and encourages a pernicious tendency in our society to reduce even the most basic human emotions to exchangeable commodities.&quot;<sup><a href="#one94">194</a></sup> The issues raised by the study of whether we should
compensate for non-economic loss or encourage a no-fault compensatory system are critically important and somewhat controversial, and deserve more serious consideration than either the Royal Commission accorded them or this article allows.
<p>
 Fudge and Tucker suggest that there is little information about the human and economic costs that can form the basis of policy choices.<sup><a href="#one95">195</a></sup> While such information is being compiled, they call for a generic reproductive hazard standard as an immediate policy response to the current regime. This standard would contain a provision that evidence establishing a <i>prima facie</i> case that workers of either sex are at risk, or that a fetus exposed via the mother or father is at risk, should trigger the assumption that all workers are at risk until proven otherwise.<sup><a href="#one96">196</a></sup> Such a standard would address many of the problems cited throughout this article, particularly if it were accompanied by strong economic protection and enforcement measures. The Royal Commission did not adopt this recommendation. It will be interesting to see whether these and other recommendations for preventive strategies are seriously considered by political decision-makers, given the comparatively small amount of attention that was given to workplace prevention issues by the Royal Commission.
<p>
BUILDING A COMPREHENSIVE REGIME
<p>
In concluding, I argue that lessons should be learned from the Quebec model in constructing a comprehensive statutory regime to address current problems with respect to protection of reproductive health rights. There are three main points. First, hazards must be reduced wherever possible. Although the ultimate goal must be zero
tolerance of reproductive hazards, this is not realistically achievable in our lifetimes. This is not to suggest that we abandon any push for the substitution of less harmful substances, merely that what is required is a continuum of strategies to reduce exposure of both men and women to workplace reproductive hazards. Thus engineering controls and workplace design which control exposure to hazards at their source are a much needed and reasonably effective alternative. As the Royal Commission points out, engineering controls are also easier to enforce than regulated exposure levels, because design controls or lack of them are immediately discernable upon inspection of the workplace.<sup><a href="#one97">197</a></sup> This may be true, but any controls must still be monitored and enforced in order to be truly effective.
<p>
In my view, prevention is likely to be more cost-effective for government, employers, and individual workers than the expensive medical technology required to cure the adverse health effects of poor preventive policies. Prevention, as is discussed below, should entail a range of strategies including mandatory pre-market testing and, where necessary and appropriate, the exclusion of harmful substances from the workplace; the implementation of design controls which focus on those employees at highest risk, namely, women and men of child-bearing age, to protect them from exposure to reproductive hazards; the implementation of preventive rights of reassignment and income protection, not only for pregnant and nursing workers, but also for those who are trying to conceive; and, as a last resort, the setting of maximum exposure levels as a means of lowering if not preventing the risk of harm. Without this continuum of preventive measures, adverse reproductive health effects will persist, as will their serious consequences for society. 
<p>
The direct compensation costs alone for disease and injury in Canada for 1987 were $3.5 billion, with indirect costs estimated at $17.5 billion for that year alone.<sup><a href="#one98">198</a></sup> For workers, the cost is
both economic and social. Reproductive hazards have an impact on their earning capacity, both in terms of access to particular jobs if women or men of child-bearing age wish to have children, and in terms of time lost due to the adverse health effects of workplace hazards. The social costs are enormous in terms of the impact on workers'
ability to have healthy families at a time they consider most appropriate. For employers, any short-term savings in the use of cheaper chemicals or unsafe work practices merely add to long-term costs, not only in terms of experience-rated workers' compensation costs, but in the loss of healthy productive workers who make a valuable contribution to the workplace. For government, the costs are borne in resources expended on the health care system, including increasing resources directed towards medical strategies to deal with the outcomes of reproductive hazards and the soaring costs of workers' compensation. Preventive strategies to eliminate many of the sources of hazards will ultimately be much more cost-effective and socially just than letting individual workers pay for the
consequences of unsafe workplaces.
<p>
Furthermore, there should be mandatory testing of all new chemicals and substances for adverse reproductive health effects <i>prior</i> to their introduction into the workplace. Existing substances in the workplace should be required to undergo rigorous toxicological studies to evaluate their effects on reproductive health. This requires a more serious effort to determine which substances negatively affect reproductive health. One background study by the Royal Commission recommended that co-ordination of previous medical and workplace records could be used to evaluate suspected workplace risks and the reproductive health effects.<sup><a href="#one99">199</a></sup> Instead of having to wait for the time-lag of new studies, researchers and government could learn from existing fragmented data bases, using these as an analytical tool to make the linkages between the cause and effect of substances.<sup><a href="#twohundred">200</a></sup> Although the epidemiological validity of such a strategy may be questionable, use of these data bases could provide an accessible starting point to determine where to focus first in actually studying and establishing cause and effect. 
<p>
Second, I would endorse the strategy suggested by Fudge and Tucker, that in the absence of an ability to eliminate all hazards, a generic reproductive standard be enacted. Once a <i>prima facie</i> case is made that a substance affects one kind of worker, for example, a pregnant woman, the standard would trigger protection for all workers
in their reproductive years. This would begin to address some of the existing problems of standards in scientific research, as well as many issues of equality of treatment raised earlier in this article. Some of the resources being expended on reproductive technologies would be better directed at prevention at the source of the problems, the workplace. Non-toxic alternatives exist for many chemicals, but are more expensive and thus are not used. Without government regulation to set universal standards, even environmentally and health-conscious employers will not change their work practices if they are to maintain their competitiveness in the market. Despite the potential employer complaints regarding too much government intervention and cost, the reality is that the social and economic costs are already being incurred. The question is who will continue to pay for them?
<p>
Third, any control strategies must be accompanied by laws which provide preventive paid leave or reassignment to less hazardous working conditions. Only in Quebec do the laws protect pregnant and nursing mothers from potential harm to themselves or their unborn or nursing children by protecting both the right to reassignment and the
economic security which allows women to exercise this right effectively. Similar laws need to be enacted in other jurisdictions, not only for this category of workers, but for all employees of child-bearing age who seek reassignment so that they can have the best chance possible of having healthy children. The federal law needs to be amended to provide for full compensation for preventive leave. As the Quebec experience has amply illustrated, express legislative provisions and full economic protection are required before workers will exercise any rights they may have to protection of the law. Any such legislation, as it does in Quebec, should remove the onus from the employee to demonstrate the work is hazardous. Further, such legislation must be given the kind of purposive interpretation which has ensured the success of the Quebec experience, and which promotes public policy goals of a safe, healthy, and productive workforce.
<p>
In the interim, existing health and safety laws should be used to test the limits of protection for workers. Unions should be encouraging their members to exercise the right to refuse unsafe work for reproductive hazards, and government inspectors should be issuing orders recognizing such rights. This should include pressing for paid reassignment away from the hazardous work until the danger is eliminated. The recent amendment to Ontario's <cite>O.H.S.A.</cite>, which in exceptional circumstances allows certified worker health and safety representatives to shut down unsafe work operations, should be assessed for its potential to deal with the most egregious reproductive health hazards.<sup><a href="#two01">201</a></sup> Training of both employee and employer health and safety representatives must begin to focus on the unique problems of workplace reproductive hazards, and where possible, joint health and safety committees should begin to seriously address control and elimination of such hazards.
<p>
Human rights laws should also be utilized where possible, particularly the provisions regarding the duty to accommodate. Further, in unionized workplaces, there is enormous potential for use of recent amendments to the Ontario <cite>Labour Relations Act</cite> which grant arbitrators the authority to interpret and apply the requirements of human rights and other employment-related statutes necessary to the interpretation of a dispute under a collective agreement.<sup><a href="#two02">202</a></sup> Finally, workers' compensation regimes which are premised upon lost earning capacity need to be supplanted by more comprehensive compensation schemes which cover all accident and illness, and do not require either the establishing of causation or proof of lost earning capacity. 
<p>
In summary, instead of the current patch-work quilt of laws which are too haphazard to provide comprehensive protection for both women and men, there needs to be a co-ordinated legislative response to implement both short- and long-term protective strategies if the current problems are to be ameliorated. Elimination of reproductive health hazards and their accompanying effects is a crucial public policy goal which requires immediate attention.

Recently common law courts have rendered a number of important decisions on the issue of recovery for relational economic loss.

are far from being consistent, but the cases share one similarity: they arose in the area of maritime law.  The author argues that support for these controversial decisions can be found in features and characteristics unique to maritime law.  These distinguish maritime law from other areas of law, and speak to the concerns that prompted the development of an exclusionary rule. Consequently, the continued strict application of the rule is not justifiable.  In some maritime law cases relational economic loss should be recoverable.

<h3>I. Introduction</h3>

Maritime law and the common law make, at times, strained bedfellows. Their relationship is complex because maritime law does not actually constitute an integral part of the common law. Instead, it is a system of laws developed independently over thousands of years which has come to be grafted onto the common law for
convenience.<sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup> In some areas this union has been virtually seamless. The common law of negligence, for example, is as important to the relationship between maritime parties as in any other context. In fact, the jurisprudence in maritime contexts has generated some of the leading decisions in the  development of the theory of tort law.<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup> This contribution has not diminished in the present day: maritime law continues to provide a venue for the resolution of issues on the leading edge of the development of the law of negligence. It is not often recognized, however, that at the same time, maritime law also
continues to develop and maintain doctrines and rules which are exclusive to its domain, and have no equivalent outside the maritime context.<sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup> This dichotomy results in situations where jurisprudence developed within the common law conflicts with the theories and policies of maritime law. The inevitable consequence of this is contradiction and confusion in the development of maritime law, particularly in the context of one of the most important current issues in maritime law: relational economic loss. 
<p>
Relational economic loss occurs when a person suffers financial loss as a result of damage to the property of another
person.<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup> As such, it forms a subset of the law of general economic loss which, in actions for negligence, deals with financial losses not causally related to physical injury of the plaintiff's person or property.<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup> Historically, common law courts routinely and as a matter of course
refused to award recovery for such damages in claims of negligence. The result was a <i>de facto</i> rule excluding such damages from recovery. The strict application of this common law `exclusionary rule' was justified by the court on a number of grounds, including the promotion of certainty in actions, and the prevention of
never-ending litigation if such recovery was permitted. In the past forty years, however, this rule has been extensively reexamined by these courts. Instead of strictly refusing to grant recovery for these losses, exceptions to the application of this exclusionary rule are gradually being recognized and developed. One of the most active areas of debate over such recovery in recent years has been that of relational economic loss.
<p>
The importance of relational economic loss to maritime law comes naturally. Maritime law, at its essence, represents a body of law devoted to the regulation of the commercial nature of maritime activity. Today, this activity involves a commercial network of highly mobile and sophisticated parties spanning the globe. At the heart of this network are the commercial fleets of the world. It is this fact that makes relational economic loss so important in maritime law. Interference with a vessel can have significant impacts on a number of parties other than the vessel's actual owner. The value of the assets and contracts involved in maritime transactions mean the losses incurred when things go wrong can easily reach tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars. Under the exclusionary rule, claims for relational economic losses in these circumstances would be unrecoverable as against the tortfeasor who caused them. 
<p>
Increasingly in recent years, some maritime courts have found this result to be unsatisfactory. They have responded by relaxing the exclusionary rule in certain contexts. The difficulty is that these decisions have not been made in any coherent manner by the courts. Instead, decisions to award recovery for relational economic loss damages have been made haphazardly, on a case-by-case basis, without providing reasoning or doctrines which can be relied upon to predict what the next court would do on similar facts. The different approaches to economic loss in general, and relational economic loss in particular, which have developed among the various common law jurisdictions in recent years have added to the confusion. The resulting state of uncertainty and confusion has led to a situation in which commentators and even some courts have openly advocated reversion back to the certainty of the traditional absolute bar to recovery.
<p>
The purpose of this article is to advocate against a return to an absolute bar to recovery for relational economic losses in maritime law. It will do so first by tracking the historical development and current status of this branch of the law in England, the United States, Canada, and Australia (the dominant common law maritime jurisdictions of the world). From this foundation it will be argued that these cases demonstrate how the reasons underlying the existence of the exclusionary rule do not always apply in the realm of maritime law. Two aspects of maritime law will then be discussed to explore this point. The first will be three sets of maritime actors, each of which raises unique considerations in arguing against the application of the exclusionary rule: 1) time and voyage charterers; 2) other third parties contractually related to a vessel; and 3) parties affected by so-called `blocking situations'.<sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup> The second aspect will be the availability of limited liability for tortfeasors in maritime law in general. All of these factors, it will be argued, demonstrate that strict application of the exclusionary rule against recovery for relational economic losses does not have a place in maritime law.
<p>
<h3>II.  Relational Economic Loss</h3>

II.1  GENERAL HISTORY OF ECONOMIC LOSS
<p>
In order to understand the law of relational economic loss as it now stands, it is necessary first briefly to examine the law of economic loss in general in order to understand where the momentum for recent changes and developments has originated.
<p>
The exclusionary rule for economic losses of any kind can be traced back to the decision of the House of Lords in <cite>Cattle v. Stockton Waterworks Co.</cite><sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup> In that case a contractor was retained by a land owner to construct a tunnel through the latter's land. A third party then interfered with the land in a way which made the contractor's contract less profitable. The House of Lords, while appearing to want
to grant the contractor's claim for damages against this third party, stated:
<blockquote>
. . . if we did so, we should establish an authority for saying that, in such cases as that of <cite>Fletcher v. Rylands</cite> the defendant would be liable, not only to an action by the owner of the drowned mine, and by such of his workmen as had their tools or clothes destroyed, but also to an action by every workman and person employed in the mine, who in consequence of the stoppage made less wages than he would have otherwise done. . . . It may be said that it is just that all such persons should have compensation for such a loss, and that, if the law does not give them redress, it is imperfect. Perhaps it may be so. But, as pointed out by Coleridge, J. in <cite>Lumley v. Gye</cite> courts of justice should not &quot;allow themselves, in the pursuit of perfectly complete remedies for all wrongful acts to transgress the bounds, which our law, in a wise consciousness as I conceive of its limited powers, has imposed on itself of redressing only the proximate and direct consequences of
wrongful acts.&quot; In this we quite agree.<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup>
</blockquote>
This statement by Blackburn L.J. reveals the driving force behind the exclusionary rule in economic loss: the fear of
indeterminate liability. Any number of people can potentially be affected by one's negligent interference with another's person or property. As a result, it is argued that if economic loss were generally permitted, a tortfeasor in such a situation would potentially face liability for claims which could not be reasonably foreseen in any way at the time of the accident, and for amounts which cumulatively could easily far exceed that relating to the property damaged by the negligence. This `floodgates' argument against the award of economic losses in any situation was best expressed by Cardozo C.J. in <cite>Ultramares Corporation v. Touche</cite>,<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup> who characterized liability for economic loss as &quot;liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class.&quot;<sup><a href="#ten">10</a></sup> This spectre of `indeterminate liability' can be seen flowing through the doctrine of economic loss to the present day; the way in which the courts continue to deal with it essentially creates most of the current difficulties.
<p>
The <cite>Cattle</cite> exclusionary rule survived intact in all its parts for almost a century,<sup><a href="#eleven">11</a></sup> until 1963 when the House of Lords relented in <cite>Hedley Byrne and Co. Ltd. v. Heller &amp; Partners Ltd.</cite><sup><a href="#twelve">12</a></sup> Even the landmark <cite>Donoghue v. Stevenson</cite>,<sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup> while developing the modern tort of negligence by formulating the reasonable foreseeability and duty of care standards, restricted damages to compensation for injuries to person or property. <cite>Hedley Byrne</cite> was the first indication of a crack in the exclusionary wall. The
original `negligent misrepresentation' case, it involved a request by the plaintiff to its bankers that they ask the defendant bankers for financial information on a company the plaintiffs were dealing with. The defendants gave the information but disavowed any responsibility for its accuracy. When the plaintiff suffered losses after relying on
the information, it sued to recover. While the disclaimer eventually protected the defendant from liability, the House of Lords clearly stated that economic losses would be permitted where a person, whose advice was relied upon because of his or her specialization or skill, has made a negligent statement or misrepresentation. The law would
impose on that person a duty to protect those who could reasonably be foreseen to be relying on the information.
<p>
It was the acceptance of <cite>Hedley Byrne</cite> in common law jurisdictions which marked the explosion in economic loss thinking. Courts, while never quick to embrace wholesale change, began to reconsider the application of the exclusionary rule in certain situations, including that of relational economic loss. The trend has been for decisions and doctrines developed in one area to migrate into others as the courts attempt to formulate tests encompassing a general theory of recovery for economic losses instead of relying upon individual exceptions. The following analysis traces this progression of the law of relational economic loss, from <cite>Hedley Byrne</cite> and in cases decided prior to it, to where it stands today in England, the U.S., Australia, and Canada.
<p>
II.2   SUPPORTING THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE
<p>
As the law currently stands, both the U.S. and English courts generally appear to support the strict application of the
exclusionary rule to claims for relational economic loss---in other words, their view is that relational economic losses should not be recoverable under any circumstances.
<p>
<i>England</i><br>
The House of Lords' reconsideration of the <cite>Cattle</cite> exclusionary rule predates <cite>Hedley Byrne</cite> to 1947, when it decided <cite>Greystoke Castle</cite>.<sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup> In that case, the plaintiff was a cargo owner who was forced to pay general average damages to the owner of the ship on which it was shipping cargo, because of damage which the defendant had caused by negligently colliding with the ship. The ship's cargo had not been damaged in any way. The cargo owner brought a claim against the defendant for the money it had been so required to pay. The House of Lords agreed that the defendant was liable. In doing so, it stated it was following the reasoning put forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in <cite>The Sucarseco</cite>,<sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup> discussed below. Specifically, the House of Lords accepted that in this situation, the ship and cargo owners were so closely intertwined in their relationship as against third parties that they constituted a `common adventure.' As a result, the cargo owner could recover as if the ship had actually been its property.
<p>
This harbinger to the end of the exclusionary rule was quoted and approved of in <cite>Hedley Byrne</cite>, but it did not gain common acceptance as a broad precedent for recovery for relational economic loss. In a succession of three cases decided in the late 1960's, lower English courts refused to award such damages. In <cite>The World Harmony</cite>,<sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup> the plaintiff was a time charterer of a ship which was sunk by another's negligence. Claiming lost profits, the plaintiff raised the general principles of <cite>Donoghue v. Stevenson</cite>, as well as the economic loss precedent set in <cite>Hedley Byrne</cite>. The court rejected this
approach, affirming that <cite>Donoghue v. Stevenson</cite> contemplated personal or property damage only, and that <cite>Hedley Byrne</cite> was based on an entirely different situation which was not applicable in this case. In <cite>Weller &amp; Co. v. Foot and Mouth Disease Research Institute</cite>,<sup><a href="#seventeen">17</a></sup> the court refused damages on the grounds of the exclusionary rule, invoking the need to avoid indeterminate liability in commercial situations. The plaintiff cattle breeder had sued for losses suffered
because cattle auctions had to be closed due to the defendant's negligence. Then, in <cite>The Wear Breeze</cite>,<sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup> a purchasor of cargo in whom ownership was to vest upon delivery sued the carrier shipowners for negligently damaging the cargo. The court reaffirmed its position from the above cases, specifically stating that under English law ship owners owed no duty to anyone except the legal owner of the cargo.<sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a></sup>
<p>
Elsewhere in the field of economic loss, the English courts were not being quite so strict. <cite>Junior Books v. Veitchi Co. Ltd.</cite> extended the exception created in <cite>Hedley Byrne</cite> into another area: product liability.<sup><a href="#twenty">20</a></sup> Likewise, <cite>Anns v. Merton London Borough Council</cite> extended recovery for economic loss to public authorities.<sup><a href="#twenty1">21</a></sup> The plaintiffs in <cite>Anns</cite> had unknowingly bought negligently constructed buildings. When the defects were discovered, the purchasers sued the city for failing to carry out its duties of
inspection and certification of the buildings as they were constructed; they sought damages amounting to the cost of
constructing new buildings. Allowing this claim, Lord Wilberforce formulated a two-part test for determining when to award damages for pure economic loss. Success in a claim on this test depended upon 1) the reasonable foreseeability of the losses suffered as a result of the negligent act, and 2) the examination of considerations which
require limitation or negation of that duty or the scope to which it extends.<sup><a href="#twenty2">22</a></sup>
<p>
Any hope that this doctrine, which was picked up in subsequent decisions such as <cite>Junior Books</cite>, would become the test for relational economic loss in England was quashed with the decision of the Privy Council in 1986 in <cite>The Mineral Transporter</cite>.<sup><a href="#twenty3">23</a></sup> The plaintiff in this case was in
the unique position of being both the owner and the time charterer of a vessel which was negligently damaged by the vessel &quot;Mineral Transporter.&quot; The plaintiff had chartered the damaged boat back from the bare-boat charterer to whom it had originally chartered the boat. The terms of this time charter included a partial `off-hire' clause. `Off-hire' clauses provide that the charterer does not have to pay hire while a vessel is incapable of providing the services for which it was chartered. In this case the clause reduced the hire payable by the plaintiff to 25% while the vessel was incapacitated awaiting repairs. The plaintiff sued the defendant for recovery of this hire as an expense caused by the accident. The vessel's demise charterer had already recovered for not only the physical damages to the boat, but the economic loss occasioned by losing 75% of the boat's hire under the `off-hire' clause. The Privy Council held that the plaintiff had no cause of action, despite the plaintiff's clear proprietary interest in the vessel as its residual owner outside of the time charter. The Privy Council said that the claim was exclusively based on the plaintiff's time charterer position. The court voiced concerns about indeterminate liability and quoted <cite>Cattle</cite> and its exclusionary rule with approval.
<p>
In the same year, the House of Lords decided <cite>The Aliakmon</cite>.<sup><a href="#twenty4">24</a></sup> The facts were almost identical to those of  <cite>The Wear Breeze</cite>, in that the claim was for losses caused as a result of damage done to cargo which was not legally the property of the plaintiff at the time of the damage. The plaintiff argued that recovery should be permitted in this case because there was no danger of indeterminate liability on these facts; only this plaintiff could possibly bring a claim. The House of Lords rejected this idea on the basis of the `slippery slope' theory; if an exception were granted here, there would be no
way to prevent it from becoming a general exception, and the spectre of indeterminate liability would become a reality. The court held that it was preferable to maintain certainty in the law by uniformly enforcing the exclusionary rule. In both The <cite>Mineral Transporter</cite> and <cite>The Aliakmon</cite>, the court explicitly stated that <cite>Greystoke Castle</cite> was an anomalous decision which should be restricted to its facts.
<p>
Any possible doubt as to the English position on relational economic loss ended with <cite>Murphy v. Brentwood District Council</cite>.<sup><a href="#twenty5">25</a></sup> On its facts it was a very similar case to <cite>Anns</cite>, in that it involved public authorities and product liability. Yet the House of Lords reviewed the problems that <cite>Anns</cite> and similar cases had caused in determining the outer margins of recoverable economic loss. Their conclusion was that outside the situation of negligent misrepresentation, no sufficient theory had developed under <cite>Anns</cite> or any other approach to prevent the possibility of indeterminate liability. While admitting that cases such as <cite>Greystoke Castle</cite> were still the law, they treated that particular case as being based in maritime law, not common law. The decision of the House of Lords was to overturn <cite>Anns</cite> and hold that outside the negligent misrepresentation context, the <cite>Cattle</cite> exclusionary rule would once again apply in full as good law against any claims for economic loss.
<p>
The result in <cite>Murphy</cite> was not a surprise given the approach towards relational economic loss that the lower courts had adopted. Ending development in all of the areas of economic loss except for negligent misrepresentation was a major step, however, and it involved overruling over twenty years of decided cases. Whether the previous momentum for change can be restricted in this way remains to be seen, but for now, relational economic loss appears to be beyond recovery in England.
<p>
<i>United States</i><br>
Long before <cite>Hedley Byrne</cite>, the U.S. confirmed its adoption of the <cite>Cattle</cite> exclusionary rule in the case of <cite>Robins Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co. v. Flint</cite>.<sup><a href="#twenty6">26</a></sup> It involved a claim by a time charterer of a vessel against the defendant repair yard for damage to the vessel during other repairs. The delay caused by the further repairs had caused the plaintiff losses in wasted hire (hire it had been required to pay the shipowner while the vessel was incapacitated). The Supreme Court of the United States held that there could be no recovery for economic losses by someone who did not hold a property interest in the property concerned: this is the traditional formulation of the exclusionary rule. This decision, closely followed by <cite>Ultramares Corporation v. Touche</cite>, and Cardozo C.J.'s comment about `indeterminate liability,<sup><a href="#twenty7">27</a></sup> appeared to leave little doubt regarding the Supreme Court's position on economic losses. 
<p>
Soon after <cite>Robins</cite>, however, the U.S. Supreme Court permitted a claim for relational economic loss by a cargo owner who sued for recovery of general average damages payable as a result of the defendant's negligent collision with the carrier vessel.<sup><a href="#twenty8">28</a></sup> These facts, almost identical to the later case of <cite>Greystoke Castle</cite> and quoted in it, led the Supreme Court to award damages on the grounds that the relationship between ship and cargo owners was so close and interdependent that it constituted a `joint adventure' which permitted recovery.
<p>
<cite>Robins</cite> remained untouched by the Supreme Court for years after this decision. Into this void stepped the lower courts, particularly the Circuit Courts of Appeal. In the vast majority of cases, these courts simply applied <cite>Robins</cite> and denied any and all claims for relational economic loss.<sup><a href="#twenty9">29</a></sup> In more recent years, however, and especially since <cite>Hedley Byrne</cite>, these courts occasionally moved towards developing further exceptions to the exclusionary rule along similar lines to
their fellow English judges. In 1974, the Ninth Circuit Court established the leading exception in this area,<sup><a href="#thirty">30</a></sup> an exception for the economic losses of fishermen as a result of oil company negligence.<sup><a href="#thirty1">31</a></sup> In 1985 the Fifth Circuit Court decided <cite>The Testbank</cite>,<sup><a href="#thirty2">32</a></sup> where a collision involving hazardous substances
resulted in the blocking of the Mississippi River, the evacuation of a 10 mile radius, and the filing of 41 claims for economic loss. The court applied <cite>Robins</cite> in all but one claim. It upheld the exception for commercial fishermen put forward in <cite>Union Oil</cite>. In 1986 the same court affirmed the exception to <cite>Robins</cite> for cargo owners as developed in <cite>The Sucarseco</cite>.<sup><a href="#thirty3">33</a></sup>
<p>
Despite the occasional development of these exceptions, some of which are unique to American law, the U.S. courts have generally been extremely consistent in their application of the exclusionary rule as formulated in <cite>Robins</cite> to the area of relational economic loss. In this, they were for a period on a different jurisprudential track from Canada, Australia, and to some extent, England. With <cite>Murphy</cite>, however, England and the U.S. now appear approximately parallel in their rejection of recovery for relational economic
losses.
<p>
II.3   CHALLENGING THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE
<p>
In recent cases both the Australian and Canadian high courts have produced decisions that imply a much greater willingness to award damages for relational economic loss. As will be demonstrated below, however, these cases have not provided any clear framework for determining the circumstances that will trigger success in such claims, nor for deciding when (or even if) the exclusionary rule should be retained. While these jurisdictions may be more
liberal in their approach to economic loss, this uncertainty makes their decisions entirely unpredictable from one case to the next.
<p>
<i>Australia</i><br>
The leading Australian case on recovery for economic loss is <cite>Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty. Ltd. v. the Dredge
&quot;Willemstad</cite>.&quot;<sup><a href="thirty4">34</a></sup> In a case where a dredge had negligently damaged a pipeline between an oil terminal and a refinery, the terminal owner sued for the economic losses incurred in transporting oil to the refinery using alternate methods. The pipeline was owned by the refinery. The High Court of Australia allowed the claim. Yet while the decision was unanimous, it was arrived at on four separate grounds by the five judges. Their decisions summarize many of the different approaches to relational economic loss which permit recovery instead of excluding it.
<p>
Two judges held that there should be an exception to the exclusionary rule where the spectre of indeterminate liability does not arise on the facts of the case. These would be cases where the plaintiff was someone the defendant should have specially foreseen as likely to suffer economic loss as a result of the defendant's actions. This `known plaintiff' would be the only person entitled to recover. Stephens J., unwilling to apply a general tort standard to the
situation, decided the case on the basis of proximity. This test requires a strong proximate relationship between the injured and the plaintiff. This judge held that in this case there was sufficient proximity between the plaintiff and the property to grant compensation. This test differs from that of the `known plaintiff' in that the defendant's knowledge of this relationship may not be a factor.
<p>
Jacobs J. based his finding on the `physical propinquity test.' He stated that recovery should be granted where the damaged property in some way has physical effects (short of actual injury) upon the assets of the plaintiff. Examples would include an inability to move, operate or utilize one's property because of what the tortfeasor has done to another's property. Here it was accepted that the plaintiff had the movement and use of its oil disrupted by the damage to the pipeline. Finally, Murphy J. applied the broadest exception. He turned to the negligence principles of <cite>Donoghue v. Stevenson</cite> and held that it should include both physical and economic losses on the same grounds: duty of care and reasonable foreseeability.
<p>
It is clear from this case that the High Court of Australia knows where it wants to go with recovery for economic losses; unfortunately, it cannot agree on how to get there. Equally unfortunate is that each of the theories proposed above has been extensively criticized as failing to provide the necessary framework and protections to permit us to abandon <cite>Cattle</cite>, even on a limited basis.
<p>
<i>Canada</i><br>
The doctrine of <cite>Cattle</cite> received the Supreme Court of Canada's approval in <cite>Warner Quinlan Asphalt Co. v. The King</cite>.<sup><a href="#thirty5">35</a></sup> The case involved a claim by a time charterer for compensation under the <cite>War Measures Act 1914</cite> for the loss of use of the chartered vessel because it had been expropriated for military service. The Supreme Court affirmed that <cite>Cattle</cite> was the law in Canada and that economic losses could not be recovered for damages to property which one did not possess or own. This stance was later confirmed in <cite>Deep Sea Tankers Ltd. v. The Tricape</cite>.<sup><a href="#thirty6">36</a></sup> 
<p>
Relational economic loss was not an area which benefited from the attempted expansions of the <cite>Hedley Byrne</cite> principle in Canada. The most that can be said is that it was suggested in some cases that, in this area, the exclusionary rule should be reconsidered.<sup><a href="#thirty7">37</a></sup> Nonetheless, the impact of decisions in other areas of economic loss gradually migrated to decisions on relational economic loss as well.
<p>
In 1977 the Federal Court decided two cases on relational economic loss: <cite>Gypsum Carrier Inc. v. R.</cite>,<sup><a href="#thirty8">38</a></sup> and <cite>Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. St. Lawrence Seaway
Authority</cite>.<sup><a href="#thirty9">39</a></sup> Both involved losses suffered as a consequence of damages to another's property. The <cite>Gypsum Carrier</cite> case involved claims by four railway companies for the expenses they incurred in rerouting their trains around a bridge negligently damaged by the defendant's vessel. Collier J. pointed to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <cite>Rivtow Marine Ltd. v. Washington Iron Works</cite>,<sup><a href="#forty">40</a></sup> in which the court had permitted
recovery for economic losses in a situation where the maker of a product was held to have a duty to warn its customers about potential problems with the product. Collier J. held that <cite>Rivtow</cite> was authority in Canada that &quot;. . . there need not be physical injury to person or property in order successfully to recover from pure economic loss.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty1">41</a></sup> On this basis, the court analyzed the claims on negligence grounds to see whether the damages were a reasonably foreseeable result of the negligence. In the end the court held that the railways' damages were not proximate enough to the bridge's damage to be a reasonably
foreseeable consequence of the collision. 
<p>
This approach did not survive long, however. The same court in <cite>Bethlehem Steel</cite> quickly retreated from this departure from the exclusionary rule. Addy J. held that the <cite>Rivtow</cite> exception did not extend to situations of relational economic loss. This case involved plaintiffs who had suffered economic losses as a result of the negligent blocking of the St. Lawrence Seaway. The court denied all of the claims against the limited liability fund. The court adopted an extremely pragmatic approach, stating that, although applying the exclusionary rule might offend one's sense of justice, it is important in areas such as relational economic loss for the law to set up a clear system of rules to permit the parties involved to know where they stand and to govern themselves
accordingly.<sup><a href="#forty2">42</a></sup>
<p>
Of course this case did not end the debate, not even within the Federal Court Trial Division. Another hint that the exclusionary rule was in doubt in this area of law occurred in <cite>The Atlantic Splendour</cite>.<sup><a href="#forty3">43</a></sup> An ore carrier was damaged due to negligence of the crew while loading at dock. The vessel remained at dock for the 17 days it took to repair the damage, even though the damage did not prevent it from being removed to another location. As a result, plaintiff's vessels were forced to stand off and wait for 17 days before getting access to the dock; the plaintiff sought the recovery for the economic losses caused by this delay. The Federal Court Trial Division granted recovery. Dube J. reviewed <cite>Gypsum Carrier</cite> and <cite>Bethlehem Steel</cite> and interpreted both cases as being decided on the basis of foreseeability. In this case, he said, the operators of the &quot;Atlantic Splendour&quot; could clearly foresee the losses their actions were causing to the parties standing off the dock and waiting for 17 days. These parties therefore recovered. On the subject of relational economic loss in general, Dube J. held that liability should flow from the same tort doctrines governing damages to property: duty and foreseeability.<sup><a href="#forty4">44</a></sup>
<p>
The Supreme Court of Canada had an opportunity to settle the debate in <cite>Ontario (A.G.) v. Fatehi</cite>.<sup><a href="#forty5">45</a></sup> Estey J., writing for the court, described relational economic
loss as &quot;unrecoverable economic loss.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty6">46</a></sup> He went on to note, however, that in <cite>Agnew-Surpass Shoes v. Cummer-Yonge Investments Ltd.</cite>,<sup><a href="#forty7">47</a></sup> Pigeon J. had approved the interpretation of <cite>Rivtow</cite> that permitted recovery without physical loss or damage.<sup><a href="#forty8">48</a></sup> Estey J. recognized that <cite>Rivtow</cite> had been subject to varied interpretations and applications in courts across the country, but then held he did not have to resolve the debate to in order to decide the case before him.
<p>
This was the situation before the leading relational economic loss case in Canada, <cite>Canadian National Railway Co. v. Norsk Pacific Steamship Co. (&quot;Jervis Crown&quot;)</cite>,<sup><a href="#forty9">49</a></sup> was decided. The facts of the case are almost identical to those of <cite>Gypsum Carrier</cite>. It involved the economic losses experienced by railway companies who had to reroute their trains around a government bridge over the Fraser River which the defendants had negligently damaged. The bridge was a major link to Vancouver. The only difference between <cite>Gypsum Carrier</cite> and <cite>Norsk</cite> was that one of the four railway companies using the bridge, C.N.R., was responsible for 86% of the usage, and the bridge was generally known as the `C.N.R. bridge.' Only C.N.R. brought its claim for economic losses to court; the other three companies agreed to be bound by the decision.
<p>
The Supreme Court decided four to three in favour of the plaintiff, awarding economic loss damages. The case, however, does little to clarify the Canadian position on relational economic loss, despite the result, because the structure of the judgments was such that each proposed approach to the problem was rejected by a majority of the
court.<sup><a href="#fifty">50</a></sup> The majority consisted of McLachlin J., writing for L'Heureux-Dube and Cory JJ., and Stevenson J.; the dissenting judgment was written by La Forest J. with Sopinka and Iacobucci JJ. concurring. The only issue that these judgments do agree upon is that <cite>Murphy</cite> is not the law in Canada.
<p>
McLachlin's judgment touched on a number of alternatives to the exclusionary rule. She compared the law of various jurisdictions and held that there are two constants in economic loss: that indeterminate liability is the overriding motivation for denying recoverability, but also that the common law will always find ways around strict rules such as the rule proposed in <cite>Murphy</cite>. In light of this, she rejected the <cite>Murphy</cite> approach and approved the incremental development of the law permitted by <cite>Nielson v. Kamloops</cite>.,<sup><a href="#fifty1">51</a></sup> an earlier decision of the court which had approved of and adopted Lord Wilberforce's two-stage test from <cite>Anns</cite>. She held that this test permitted case-by-case development in the law of economic loss, and yet provided for protections against indeterminate liability.
<p>
McLachlin J. then set out what would be required to grant economic loss recovery in a particular case. She focussed on proximity, stating that &quot;pure economic loss is prima facie recoverable where, in addition to negligence and foreseeable loss, there is sufficient proximity between the negligent act and the loss.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty2">52</a></sup> In applying this formulation to the case, she held that the relationship between C.N.R. and the government in connection with the bridge was of such closeness that they constituted a `common adventure,' as was originally suggested in <cite>Greystoke Castle</cite>. She stated that this placed C.N.R. in essentially the same position as the owner of the bridge and it made no sense to deny them recovery for losses resulting from its damage.<sup><a href="#fifty3">53</a></sup> 
<p>
Stevenson J. rejected this approach. Restricting his comments to relational economic loss (which McLachlin J. had not done), he believed McLachlin J.'s formulation provided insufficient protection against indeterminate liability. Instead, he favoured the `known plaintiff' test for liability; that the plaintiff had to be a specific individual the defendant could foresee sustaining harm by his or her negligence. On this approach he held that C.N.R.'s association with the bridge was sufficiently well known to the defendant that it could foresee the damages which would be  caused as a result of the collision.
<p>
La Forest J., writing for himself and Sopinka and Iacobucci JJ., dissented strongly. He recognized that in other economic loss situations, there may be recovery for economic losses and he rejected <cite>Murphy</cite> as law in Canada; he then restricted his comments to relational economic loss. Referring to the majority judgments, he
dismissed McLachlin J.'s discussion of proximity as insufficiently precise to guard against indeterminate liability. Instead La Forest J. took a more policy-oriented approach to the issue. He stated that there was no policy reason for awarding relational economic loss damages on the basis that it would provide a disincentive to tortfeasors, simply because liability for physical damage does this now. Instead, he said that policy considerations gave rise to a need
to examine the positions of both the plaintiff and defendant to determine their ability to foresee and provide for such damage. His approach advocates that relational economic loss in each case should be allocated to the party best able to protect himself or herself from such harm.<sup><a href="#fifty4">54</a></sup> Only when the situation
warrants would the exclusionary rule be relaxed and the person who actually suffered the loss be allowed to recover. On the facts of <cite>Norsk</cite>, he concluded that this was not such a case. In his opinion the railway companies were sophisticated actors who knew of the bridge's importance to their operation and could have made any number of contractual or insurance provisions against the possibility of its damage. The losses experienced should therefore lie with the railway companies.<sup><a href="#fifty5">55</a></sup> 
<p>
Canadian law of economic loss, therefore, stands in almost as great a state of flux as that of Australia. On a strict reading, McLachlin J.'s decision has to be taken as the <i>ratio</i> of <cite>Norsk</cite> and therefore the leading statement in Canadian law, but it is not possible to ignore the strength of the dissenting opinions in the case. The only certainty is that Canadian law has advanced a much more accommodating approach to economic loss in general, and to relational economic loss in particular, than have England and the United States.
<p>
<i>Analyzing the Alternatives</i><br>
Between <cite>Caltex</cite> and <cite>Norsk</cite>, a number of alternate theories have been proposed as to when and how the exclusionary rule should be relaxed or even abandoned in relational economic loss cases. It is not possible to conduct an extended critical analysis of each here, but it is important to note that none has been free from criticism, either in the decisions of other judges or in academic writings. Murphy J.'s approach in <cite>Caltex</cite>, that economic loss damages simply receive the same treatment as physical damages, may be appealing in its simplicity, but it has been severely criticized by writers who maintain that there are inherent differences between such losses.<sup><a href="#fifty6">56</a></sup> The other approaches have received similar treatments. The `known plaintiff' test, for example, has been rejected as basing liability simply on the level of notoriety of the plaintiff; if, and only if, the defendant has heard of the plaintiff, the plaintiff succeeds.<sup><a href="#fifty7">57</a></sup> Reliance on the principle of proximity, although this principle is recognized as necessary to some extent in any successful theory, has been criticized as too imprecise to protect against indeterminate liability.<sup><a href="#fifty8">58</a></sup> The suggestions of La Forest in <cite>Norsk</cite> that the losses should lie with those best able to provide against them has been denounced as being inconsistent with the entire theory of malfeasance which is the foundation of tort law.<sup><a href="#fifty9">59</a></sup> It also works effectively only in hindsight, as a party will only know whether it will be liable for damages when it knows the identity and financial circumstances of the other party in an action, and can determine which of them is more capable of sustaining such losses.
<p>
II.4   CONCLUSION
<p>
Any review of these exceptions to the exclusionary rule and their problems makes it rather easy to sympathize with the position of the House of Lords in <cite>Murphy</cite>, in other words, that the debate continues to create greater uncertainty instead of resolving anything and as such it is best for it simply to be terminated. This does not appear to be an option, however. The history of economic loss at common law suggests that this debate continue in Canada and Australia in the near future, and to a lesser degree in the U.S. History also suggests that courts in England will soon be developing ways to get around both the <cite>Cattle</cite> and <cite>Murphy</cite> decisions.
<p>
This does not satisfy the needs of maritime actors who need to understand where they stand today with regards to possible liabilities. The next section will be an examination of how the general doctrine on relational economic loss has translated into three very specific areas of maritime law: charters, third party relationships with vessels, and traffic blockages. As will be seen, each area presents new arguments both for and against the exclusionary rule which are unique to its sphere, and suggests that a single approach to relational economic loss may be impractical to
apply.
<p>
<h3>III.  Economic Loss at Maritime Law</h3>

III.1   THE AREAS FOR RELATIONAL ECONOMIC LOSS
<p>
In his article written in anticipation of the House of Lords' decision in <cite>The Mineral Transporter</cite>, N.J.J. Gaskell identified three areas of maritime law specifically affected by decisions in the law of relational economic loss. These areas are: 1) charters other than demise charters; 2) third party contractors with damaged vessels; and 3) situations known as `blocking cases,' where traffic or movement of some sort has been impeded by the negligent
action involved.<sup><a href="#sixty">60</a></sup> 
<p>
The common law of each for these areas is as confusing as the whole law of relational economic loss. While the majority of cases have applied the traditional exclusionary rules, more recent cases have held out the possibility, whether simply in hints or open developments of doctrine, of abandoning this strict restriction in favour of one which will permit recovery in certain situations. The result is a potential quagmire for anyone interested in predicting a party's potential liability, or a given court's decision in any situation. The following is an attempt to summarize in brief where each subset of the law of relational economic loss stands now in each jurisdiction, what the practical consequences of each are, and how they could be avoided by changes in the doctrine.
<p>
III.2   CHARTERS
<p>
As defined in <cite>Chorely and Giles'</cite>, a charterparty is a contract between a charterer and a shipowner for the hire of the use of a ship.<sup><a href="#sixty1">61</a></sup> Demise charterers hire a vessel for an indefinite amount of time, with the charterer providing any and all crew required. Such charterers are by definition deemed to take a property interest in the vessels so chartered.<sup><a href="#sixty2">62</a></sup> As a result, their claims for economic losses arising from damage to a vessel are on the same footing as the actual residual owner, and never constitute claims for relational economic loss. Instead, relational economic loss arises with charterers who do not have this presumed property interest. These are charters for either specific periods of time (time charterers) or for specific voyages (voyage charterers).
<p>
This area is in itself a microcosm of the entire debate over relational economic loss. In a large number of situations the court's denial of recovery on the basis of the exclusionary rule appears both unjust and illogical, as convincing arguments can be put forward to support recovery in these cases. As will be seen with sub-charters, however, the issue quickly gets much cloudier when the parameters are relaxed. In the end, if the exclusionary rule is to be relaxed, the ultimate choice as to where the line is to be drawn against indeterminate liability may have to rely much more on policy than on any substantive legal reasoning. 
<p>
<i>Time Charters</i><br>
A large number of relational economic loss cases have focussed on the position of the time charterer in trying to recover losses, whether for wasted hire during the boat's repair or lost profits from its lack of use, occasioned by the negligent damage of the chartered vessel.
<p>
The application of the <cite>Cattle</cite> exclusionary rule to time charters was specifically confirmed by the House of Lords in two cases: <cite>Chargeurs R&eacute;unis Compagnie Fran&ccedil;aise de Navigation &agrave;
Vapeur v. English and American Shipping Co.</cite>,<sup><a href="#sixty3">63</a></sup> and <cite>Elliott Steam Tug Co. Ltd. v. Shipping Controller</cite>.<sup><a href="#sixty4">64</a></sup> In both cases, claims for wasted hire and lost profits were dismissed on the grounds that the common law recognized no right to damages based upon a solely contractual relationship to damaged property.<sup><a href="#sixty5">65</a></sup>
<p>
The U.S. adopted this thinking in toto in <cite>Robins</cite>, the case which established the exclusionary rule in American law and which itself is a time charterer case. Holmes J. explicitly adopted the reasoning of <cite>Elliott</cite>, above, in denying liability.<sup><a href="#sixty6">66</a></sup>
<p>
England confirmed its approach as recently as 1985 in <cite>The Mineral Transporter</cite>,<sup><a href="#sixty7">67</a></sup> upholding the reasoning of <cite>Cattle</cite> and <cite>Elliott</cite> in what has to be seen as the most extreme of cases.<sup><a href="#sixty8">68</a></sup> The facts, once again, were that the plaintiff was the residual owner of a vessel which it was time chartering back from the bare-boat charterer of the vessel. The vessel was damaged by the negligent actions of &quot;The Mineral Transporter.&quot; The `off-hire'
clause in the time charter provided that while the ship was being repaired, the plaintiff's hire payable was reduced to 25% of the normal rate. The plaintiff claimed against &quot;The Mineral Transporter&quot; for this cost as economic loss. At the time, the demise charterer had already successfully claimed for both damages to the vessel and for the economic losses suffered by having to forego 75% of hire on the vessel.
<p>
The Privy Council said that the plaintiff had no cause of action, based on <cite>Cattle</cite> and <cite>Elliott</cite>. This was despite the fact that the plaintiff had a definite property interest in the vessel as
its residual owner after the demise charter. The Privy Council stated that the plaintiff's claim arose solely from the time charter, and these were the rights to which the plaintiff was therefore restricted. The plaintiff also argued that had there been a full `off-hire' clause, the demise charterer would have suffered these losses as lost hire as well, instead of only the 75% loss which was suffered, but would have been able to recover all of this amount from the defendant. Therefore all the time charterparty and the off-hire clause did was distribute the same loss. The Privy Council dismissed this fact as irrelevant and affirmed <cite>Cattle</cite>.
<p>
In Canada time charterers appear not to have had an easier time than in England and the U.S., but later cases may be leading to a difference in doctrine. In <cite>Warner Quinlan Asphalt</cite>,<sup><a href  = "#sixty9">69</a></sup> the Supreme Court of Canada also specifically adopted the <cite>Elliott</cite> reasoning. In 1955, however, even before <cite>Hedley Byrne</cite>, the Supreme Court hinted in <cite>The Tricape</cite>
that it might be willing to depart from this rule.<sup><a href="#seventy">70</a></sup> This case involved the claims of the owner and charterer of a negligently damaged vessel; the charterer's claims centred on the full hire paid during repairs to the chartered vessel. At trial, both parties were denied recovery, the charterer specifically on the basis of <cite>Elliott</cite>. Only the owner's case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The court reversed on this ground, but specifically stated it did not want to comment on the reasoning and authorities
applied at trial to exclude the charterer from recovery.<sup><a href="#seventy1">71</a></sup>
<p>
This slim ray of jurisprudential hope for time charterers was picked up by the lower courts. In <cite>Courtenay v. Knutson</cite>,<sup><a href="#seventy2">72</a></sup> the Supreme Court of British Columbia granted recovery to a charterer for loss of use of a barge. The finding in that case, however, rested upon determining that a relationship greater than a standard charter party agreement existed. Yet the position of the time charterer appeared to slip from the minds of most courts. In a number of cases subsequently decided involving claims by time charterers, their status was ignored in the reasoning of the court: they were considered to be in the same position as owners.<sup><a href="#seventy3">73</a></sup> The most drastic example of this occurred in <cite>The Atlantic Splendour</cite>,<sup><a href="#seventy4">74</a></sup> in which the plaintiff time charterers were awarded damages due to being delayed for 17 days because the defendants blocked their access to a loading dock. The plaintiffs recovered despite the fact they were time charterers, a fact which was not even mentioned in the case.<sup><a href="#seventy5">75</a></sup> The ignorance of the status of time charterers in these claims went against the clear authorities of <cite>Warner Quinlan Asphalt</cite>, <cite>The Tricape</cite>, and <cite>Elliott</cite>, which all held this fact alone would have prevented recovery.<sup><a href="#seventy6">76</a></sup>
<p>
The effect of <cite>Norsk</cite> on all of this is unclear, in that it is not a time charterer case. <cite>The Mineral Transporter</cite> was discussed and considered by La Forest J., but not expressly applied. McLachlin J.'s `common adventure' approach might provide a ground for recovery for Canadian time charterers, on the argument that the relationship between shipowners and time charterers is close enough to create such a `common adventure' position with regards to the vessel: cargo owners were deemed to be so related in <cite>Greystoke Castle</cite> (see the discussion in the next section regarding voyage charterers). The only clear conclusion is that while <cite>The Mineral Transporter</cite> has not been approved of by the Supreme Court, the weight of existing Canadian precedent, while apparently lying dormant, still mitigates against time charterers being able to recover for economic loss.
<p>
Despite all of this judicial consideration and precedent, there is a strong case to be made for allowing economic loss recovery to time charter claimants. The main argument is that the <cite>Cattle</cite> exclusionary rule adopted in <cite>Elliott</cite> is designed to protect against indeterminate liability. Time charterer cases raise no such spectre; the time charterer stands in essentially the same position as the owner of the boat would in relation to the negligent
defendant. No one involved in maritime operations could claim that the existence of a time charterer might not be reasonably foreseeable in relation to any particular vessel. Furthermore, granting time charterers economic loss recovery would not result in liability to an `indeterminate class' because the time charterer is easily identifiable as a discrete set, either of a single or in the case of sub charters (discussed below), a small number of potential claimants. There is no way for this group to grow beyond these small numbers, as the qualifying factor is a specific, and by its nature exclusive, contractual relationship with the vessel.
<p>
The current law creates a situation of extreme unfairness to charterers, in that the defendant's liability for economic loss is determined by the presence or absence of an `off-hire' clause in the charterparty. <cite>The Mineral Transporter</cite> demonstrates this quirk of excluding charterers from recovery. If a full off-hire clause existed in that case, then the plaintiff time charterer would not have to pay hire and would therefore suffer no economic loss. The demise charterer would instead suffer a greater economic loss, as now, instead of losing 75% of the hire receivable, 100% of it would be an economic loss. But the demise charterer can recover this amount from the defendant, because its claim for economic loss can be related to its property interest in the vessel. The defendant becomes liable for all the losses, physical and economic, suffered by its action. In contrast, no off-hire clause exists in the charterparty, the demise charterer has no economic losses to claim as it is receiving full hire from the time charterer. The economic losses resulting from the defendant's negligence have therefore been allocated to the time charterer through the off-hire clause, in that the time charterer has to pay full hire without getting any benefit out of the vessel. Yet this loss cannot be recovered due to the exclusionary rule. The result is that the defendant is liable only for the physical damages and avoids paying for economic losses resulting from its actions altogether. In <cite>The Mineral Transporter</cite>, the defendant only had to pay 75% of the economic losses caused by its action, because the off-hire clause had allocated 25% of the loss to the time charterer and therefore was outside the reach of recovery.
<p>
The effect of applying the exclusionary rule to time charters is therefore twofold. It protects the defendant against the possibility of indeterminate claimants from a class which by definition cannot become an infinite class and is instead hardly less foreseeable than the owner of a vessel as a particular claimant. It also results in the extent of the defendant's liability being determined on the basis of the presence or absence of an 'off-hire' clause in the charterparty contract, of which the defendant can have no knowledge before the accident. This clause has the potential to unfairly allocate losses to the time charterer which would otherwise be recoverable from the vessel's owner and to block their recovery. Both of these effects argue for at least a reconsideration of the application of the exclusionary rule to time charterers: as will be demonstrated below, however, this solution may not be as simple as
making a special exception in this case.
<p>
<i>Voyage Charterers</i><br>
Traditionally, voyage charterers have suffered the same treatment as time charterers at common law: no proprietary interest, therefore no recovery for economic losses.<sup><a href  = "#seventy7">77</a></sup> As Gaskell notes, the opportunity for loss by a voyage charterer may be less, in that much of the potential loss will be taken up by demurrage (liquidated damages payable for delays in cargo loading, as set out in voyage charterparties). Losses may still be experienced, however, in the form of lost profits or extra expenses incurred in rerouting cargo.<sup><a href="#seventy8">78</a></sup> 
<p>
The reasons put forth against applying the <cite>Cattle</cite> rule to time charterers apply equally as well to voyage charterers; they also cannot constitute an indeterminate class of plaintiffs, and are prejudiced by off-hire clauses in the same way. There is also an additional argument which bolsters their right to recover for economic losses. It flows from the idea that voyage charterers can be characterized as cargo owners who simply fill all or part of the holds of a carrier vessel. Essentially the only difference between voyage charterers and cargo owners is the size of their respective shipments. In the case of the person shipping cargo, his or her cargo follows the ship's schedule; a voyage charterer's cargo is of so large a size that he or she can get the ship to follow his or her
cargo's schedule. 
<p>
It has already been discussed above that cargo owners enjoy one of the few universally recognized exceptions to the exclusionary rule, permitting recovery for general average economic loss damages. General average damages are damages payable where the loss to either a cargo owner or vessel owner was incurred as a result of a deliberate act to benefit (usually to save) the majority of the cargo or the vessel. As they benefit from the other's loss, the parties
suffering no damage are jointly liable to compensate the party suffering the loss.<sup><a href="#seventy9">79</a></sup> Under the doctrine of <cite>The Sucarseco</cite> and <cite>Greystoke Castle</cite>, cargo owners have the right to recover general average economic damages from those who damage the vessel in which their cargo is carried, even where the cargo itself has not been damaged in any way. <cite>Greystoke Castle</cite> was one of the few exceptions to the exclusionary rule confirmed in <cite>Murphy</cite>; Lord
Keith approved of it on the grounds that it turned &quot;on specialities of maritime law or concerned the relationship of joint adventurers at sea.&quot;<sup><a href="eighty">80</a></sup>
<p>
Yet <cite>Greystoke</cite> was not restricted in its reasoning to general average claims. Lord Roche's examples extended beyond the maritime field to any example of a carrier of goods and the shipper, and beyond general average to any expenses of lost time and rerouting by the shipper.<sup><a href="#eighty1">81</a></sup> 
<p>
Even if we restrict <cite>Greystoke</cite> to the maritime context, on its reasoning a cargo owner should be able to recover expenses for rerouting cargo as well as for general average. The author was unable to find any reported cases discussing this issue. If this reasoning is accepted, however, it appears only logical that the same right
should be available to the voyage charterer. A voyage charterer would stand in a much closer `joint adventure' relationship (<cite>Greystoke Castle</cite>'s test) with a vessel's owner than a simple cargo owner.
<p>
Therefore permitting a voyage charterer to avoid the application of the exclusionary rule would be entirely consistent with existing jurisprudence in the U.S. and England. In Canada, the argument should be even easier to make, because <cite>Greystoke</cite>'s reasoning is similar to that of McLachlin J. in <cite>Norsk</cite>; she specifically approves of the case. It remains to be seen whether the courts will accept this approach.
<p>
<i>Sub-charterers</i><br>
If the situation of individual time and voyage charterers argues strongly for recovery for relational economic loss, the practical results of permitting such recovery, when the group of affected charterers grows, strains this approach somewhat, and possibly renews support for the application of the exclusionary rule.
<p>
Despite the fact that the consideration of sub-charterers extends the list of potential claimants, it does not present the possibility for indeterminate claims by indeterminate numbers of plaintiffs. This is because there are practical restrictions on how long the chain of charters on any given vessel can possibly be. It is unusual to find more than five charters between any vessel's current user and its owner; moreover, arrangements of this type are foreseeable
characteristic of any vessel operating.
<p>
Instead, the difficulty comes from potential indeterminate liability on the part of the defendant in such actions. This liability is not infinite, but it may be entirely unpredictable by the defendant. If recovery is extended to time and voyage charterers suffering economic losses, as argued above, the amount of money the defendant would be liable for in a given situation will depend entirely upon a factor the defendant cannot in any way anticipate before the event: the culprit is once again the `off-hire' clause.
<p>
A complete treatment of the effects of a number of charter arrangements with varying off-hire clauses on the liability of a defendant if charterers were granted recovery is set out in Gaskell.<sup><a href="#eighty2">82</a></sup> Only a simple example will be used here to demonstrate the problem; to simplify the discussion, it will contemplate only claims for expenses and not lost profits.
<p>
A given vessel is negligently damaged by the defendant. This vessel was subject to the following charterparty arrangement: the owner, O, had demise chartered the vessel to A for $10,000 per month. A had in turn time chartered the vessel to B for $11,000 per month; B had then voyage chartered the vessel to C for one month for $12,000. The damage to the vessel requires it to be docked for repairs for the month of C's charter (the line of charters would be O-A-B-C).
<p>
If, as argued, full recovery for economic losses is allowed, and no off-hire clauses exist between any of the parties, then the defendant's liability for economic loss is restricted to $12,000, being the amount of hire wasted by C on the vessel. All the other parties are getting full hire paid under the charters, and they are suffering no losses as a result of the negligence. If instead C had a full off-hire clause in its charter contract with B, then B, not C, would claim for economic loss as C would no longer be suffering while B would be losing $11,000 per month in rent it had to pay to A. The defendant's liability would be to B, not C, and would increase to $11,000 by operation of the off-hire clause. The situation changes greatly if the only off-hire clause exists between A and B. C would still have a claim for $12,000 against the defendant as if no off-hire clauses existed at all. However, A has to pay hire to O but is receiving no income from B because of the off-hire clause. A would therefore have a claim against the defendant for $10,000. The defendant's liability is now $22,000, up $12,000 from the earlier situation, entirely as a result of the existence and position of off-hire clauses in the arrangement.
<p>
One argument for recovery by time and voyage charterers is that the exclusionary rule unfairly benefits defendants when off-hire clauses exist. It can now be seen that if recovery is permitted, defendants would also potentially be prejudiced by the existence of such clauses. The question is whether this problem can be addressed without requiring strict application of the exclusionary rule to all charterer situations. One possible solution might be a policy decision permitting only one charterer to claim per vessel.<sup><a href="#eighty3">83</a></sup> Another solution might be to restrict the number of positions down the chain from the current operating charter that the defendant has to compensate. Or it could be argued that the defendant should get no protection; that these losses are the result of the actions of the defendant and as such the defendant should be liable for all of them without having
the benefit of any such protections. 
<p>
Whatever the solution in the sub-charter situation, it should not be allowed to be a ground for taking the easy road and applying the exclusionary rule to avoid this problem. The exclusionary rule no longer makes any sense in application to time and voyage charterers, if it ever did, and in this area of relational economic loss at least, maritime actors should be able to rely on their reasonable expectations for recovery.
<p>
III.3   OTHER THIRD PARTIES
<p>
In the broadest sense, charterers are simply third parties with a contractual interest in the damaged vessel. As such, while they are distinguishable on the nature of the contract from other claimants, they do not represent the only parties susceptible to economic losses through contractual association with a vessel or other property. Vessels especially are usually surrounded by a web of contractual relations with various parties. A partial list of such
parties includes stevedores and longshoremen, tug owners, cargo owners, fuel suppliers, and maintenance and repair yards. All of these parties and others can at any given time have contracts which are adversely affected by someone's negligent interference with the operation of a particular vessel, resulting in economic losses. For
example, stevedores and longshoremen may have to forego loading contracts for a delayed vessel, and they may never recover the amounts potentially earned under the contracts. Fuel suppliers may purchase diesel for inventory in anticipation of the arrival of a vessel according to a standing contract, only to have that vessel's destination changed as a result of an accident; the fuel purchased may not be sold as quickly as it would have been, or on terms as good, resulting in a loss. A cargo owner's deliveries would be delayed by a delay in the carrier's voyage; tug boats under contract to a particular vessel will be prejudiced if the vessel is delayed or never shows up at the port at all. These are only a sample of the potential sources of economic losses suffered by contractual third parties to a vessel.
<p>
Traditionally the claims of all these parties have been the victims of the exclusionary rule of <cite>Cattle</cite> and have been denied as a result. This is not unexpected. Both <cite>Cattle</cite> and <cite>Robins</cite> have as their central premise that parties related to property only through contract do not have sufficient interest in the property to
recover for economic losses.<sup><a href="#eighty4">84</a></sup> Yet once again, these are cases where the potential for unlimited liability by the defendant has to be questioned. All of these parties, and maybe even the losses they suffer, would be reasonably foreseeable by any defendant, especially given the fact that the defendant in many cases will have similar contracts surrounding the activities of its own vessel. Furthermore, the limits of liability in these cases would be subject to the principle of proximity in the same way as liability for physical damages; the economic loss equivalent of Mrs. Palsgraf would not collect as a result of simply extending the duty to protect the foreseeable contractual parties from economic losses.
<p>
Unfortunately, none of the courts in the jurisdictions examined above appear to be making any move towards extending the bounds of recovery to any party contractually related to a vessel, either to charterers or other third parties. The only ray of hope for these parties desiring recovery is again <cite>Greystoke Castle</cite>, which permits cargo owners to recover their losses from rerouting and delays if their carrier vessel is delayed. That case, as well as <cite>Norsk</cite>, however, awarded damages on the basis of a `common adventure' existing between the property owner and the plaintiff. The limits of this relationship have not been clearly defined, but undoubtedly an
onshore supplier of a vessel will have a harder time satisfying such a test than a cargo owner would. Not only that, but in Canada at least, La Forest J.'s dissent in <cite>Norsk</cite> would argue strongly against recovery in these situations. As discussed above, La Forest J. advocated that the loss be allocated to those parties most capable of bearing the loss in a given situation. For a diversified group of suppliers, the vessel in question would represent only a portion of their activities, and they would also be experienced actors in their particular businesses and therefore able to foresee the possibility of such economic losses occurring. They would most likely, therefore, be deemed to be the appropriate parties to bear the economic losses than the defendant, who would have to bear the sum of these losses alone.
<p>
For most third party contractors with a vessel, the law of economic loss is therefore relatively clear and consistent among all common law jurisdictions. This is despite recent decisions in Australia and Canada relaxing the exclusionary rule in other contexts of relational economic loss in the maritime area. Despite the arguments which
exist to support recovery, the general exclusionary rule, as set out in either <cite>Cattle</cite> or <cite>Robins</cite>, is of full force and effect.
<p>
III.4   BLOCKING CASES
<p>
This area of the law of relational economic loss in the maritime context is perhaps the most complex of all. On one side, the spectre of indeterminate liability that has been a factor in every economic loss decision is front and centre as a consideration. Yet this area has been the focus of recent decisions which have presented a large number of arguments supporting relief from the exclusionary rule in this situation. Particularly, <cite>Norsk</cite> and <cite>Caltex</cite>, two of the most prominent recent decisions in this entire area of economic loss, have awarded recovery in blocking case situations. Furthermore, the importance of understanding what is happening in this debate and where it is going has an urgency beyond simply resolving a conflict at common law. Blocking situations represent potentially the greatest liability situation possible at maritime law, and all parties involved on a practical level need to know their potential liability in terms of the economic losses they can generate.
<p>
In simple terms, blocking claims arise when the defendant's alleged negligence impedes the freedom of movement and/or travel of the plaintiff's property, causing the plaintiff economic losses. There are a number of manifestations of this situation. The most commonly litigated cases, which also cause the biggest problem in terms of theory, are cases where the negligence of the defendant actually blocks a waterway, restricting the traffic of other vessels past the point of the accident. The traffic impeded need not be maritime travel. The so-called `bridge cases' such as <cite>Norsk</cite>, where a vessel damages a bridge used by other modes of transportation, are also blocking cases. So is <cite>Caltex</cite>, where the flow of oil through a pipeline was disrupted.
<p>
<i>England and the U.S.</i><br>
England has had an uncharacteristically quiet history of decisions in these cases. The only reported decisions are of lower courts; as such there is no leading English case to examine as a statement of the law in that country. However, the consistency of the approach of the decided cases, as well as the approach to the issue taken by higher English courts in other areas of relational economic loss, leave little doubt as to which side of the exclusionary rule debate the Appeal Courts or the House of Lords would come down on in this debate. <cite>The Anglo-Algerian S.S. v. Holder</cite>,<sup><a href="#eighty5">85</a></sup> and <cite>The Maindy Manor</cite><sup><a href="#eighty6">86</a></sup> are two of the reported lower court decisions. In <cite>Anglo-Algerian</cite>, the
defendant's ship damaged a series of canal locks; the plaintiff's ship arrived and was delayed two and a half days while repairs were effected. The court refused to grant a claim for losses suffered as a result of this delay, on the grounds that the defendant owed a duty to no one but the owner of the property. Similarly, in <cite>The Maindy Manor</cite> a river was blocked by the negligent grounding of the defendant's ship; again claims for losses by those ships which were delayed until the ship could be removed were denied.
<p>
The U.S. has arrived at essentially the same position in its doctrine, but on the basis of a large number of decided cases. This is due to the U.S. courts having been extremely consistent in denying blocking case claims on the basis of <cite>Robins</cite>. Recent cases continue to invoke this rule. For example, in <cite>General Foods v. U.S.</cite>,<sup><a href="#eighty7">87</a></sup> a regular bridge user's claim for costs incurred when the bridge was damaged was denied. A similar claim for lost wages by railway employees who lost work hours due to rerouting around a bridge damaged by the defendant's negligence was also denied in <cite>The Northern King</cite>.<sup><a href="#eighty8">88</a></sup> In <cite>The Testbank</cite>,<sup><a href="#eighty9">89</a></sup> the majority of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal recognized that the plaintiff may indeed have been reasonably foreseeable, but stated that this was irrelevant as <cite>Robins</cite> denied recovery in any circumstance.<sup><a href="#ninety">90</a></sup>
<p>
There are signs, however, that even U.S. courts are beginning to have second thoughts about the application of <cite>Robins</cite> in this area. The first such sign was the decision of the Second Circuit Court of Appeal in <cite>Re Kinsman Transit Co.</cite>,<sup><a href="#ninety1">91</a></sup> known as <cite>Kinsman II</cite>. The claims arose when a negligently moored ship freed itself from its moorings during a winter storm. It collided with and freed another ship; both ships then drifted down river to collide with a drawbridge in the city of
Buffalo. The effect was to block the river with ice, causing extensive flooding upstream. The <cite>Kinsman I</cite><sup><a href="#ninety2">92</a></sup> consisted of claims for physical damages which were allowed against the defendant as being reasonably foreseeable.
<p>
The <cite>Kinsman II</cite> case consisted of claims for economic loss, including two claims by shippers who were delayed as a result of the blockage of the river. One vessel had been prevented from making a delivery upriver from the blockage and claimed for costs incurred in finding alternate sources of supply for its customer; the other had been delayed in loading operations by the ice caused by the blockage. The trial judge denied both claims on the basis of <cite>Robins</cite>. The Court of Appeal agreed with the result, but held that a tort analysis was preferable to the exclusionary rule in these circumstances. On this analysis, the two claims still failed, but only because they
were held to have been too remote.<sup><a href="#ninety3">93</a></sup>
<p>
The reasoning in the <cite>Kinsman II</cite> decision has had far-reaching implications for the theory of relational economic loss in the U.S.<sup><a href="#ninety4">94</a></sup> Other circuit courts of appeal have expressly adopted its reasoning as their method for analysis in a number of cases.<sup><a href="#ninety5">95</a></sup> It was also relied on in the dissenting opinion of Wisdom J. in <cite>The Testbank</cite>; the contrasting judgments in that case have been referred to as the starting point for any understanding of the current debate over <cite>Robins</cite> in American law.<sup><a href="#ninety6">96</a></sup>
<p>
One must conclude, therefore, that both England and the U.S. can be relied upon to continue the application of the <cite>Cattle</cite> and <cite>Robins</cite> principles in the near future. While the U.S. may be showing some signs of weakening in this position and adopting instead a tort-based analysis of economic losses in blocking cases, this has yet to achieve broad and regular acceptance as overruling <cite>Robins</cite>. The relative certainty in the position of both jurisdictions is in sharp contrast with the current situation in Australia and Canada.
<p>
<i>Australia and Canada</i><br>
The law regarding blocking cases in both Australia and Canada currently suffers from the difficulty that recent high court decisions in the area have provided little definite direction to parties wanting to understand their potential liability. As was discussed above, both <cite>Caltex</cite> and <cite>Norsk</cite> are blocking cases; the reasoning in these cases is therefore directly relevant to this area of the law. But as was also noted above, neither case provides definitive guidelines for analyzing economic loss situations. The only certainty as a result of these decisions is that in blocking cases, both jurisdictions appear to be perfectly willing to reject the exclusionary rule and examine individual situations on the basis of tort analysis to determine liability. Concentrating on Canadian jurisprudence prior to <cite>Norsk</cite>, it can be seen that this recent position is not a dramatic change from that of previous decisions. In fact, Canadian courts appear to have been much more open to avoiding the exclusionary rule in these circumstances as they have been in, for example, charterparty cases. Given the limited blocking situation in <cite>Norsk</cite>, however, how far will its reasoning be extended in subsequent decisions?
<p>
The major Canadian blocking cases prior to <cite>Norsk</cite> have already been discussed in detail above, as such cases have been among the few maritime relational economic loss cases decided in Canada. These cases are <cite>Gypsum Carrier</cite>,<sup><a href="#ninety7">97</a></sup> <cite>Bethlehem Steel</cite>,<sup><a href="#ninety8">98</a></sup> and <cite>The Atlantic Splendour</cite>.<sup><a href="#ninety9">99</a></sup> <cite>Gypsum Carrier</cite> was a similar case to <cite>Norsk</cite>. Railway traffic had been blocked by a damaged bridge. The court held that the appropriate approach was one based on duty and reasonable foreseeability, not strict exclusion of liability. While recovery was still rejected in that case, it was due
to a lack of proximity. In <cite>Bethlehem Steel</cite>, the situation was a more conventional blocking case in that the defendant blocked a waterway and the claims were for economic damages to other vessels delayed as a result. The court in that case took a much harder line against applying an exception to the exclusionary rule in blocking
cases, stating that this was not an area for such an exception. The tort analysis was again used in <cite>The Atlantic Splendour</cite>, however, and it was on this test that recovery was permitted. While this case may be unique from a tort perspective in that it involved a continuous act of blocking over 17 days with the plaintiffs' vessel standing by, it still represents a departure from the exclusionary rule.
<p>
<cite>Norsk</cite>, therefore, was decided against a backdrop of already confusing jurisprudence on this issue, and <cite>Norsk</cite> did not help to resolve the situation. The majority judgment accepted the need for exceptions to the exclusionary rule in these cases, and affirmed the use of tort principles to determine liability for economic loss. It cannot be ignored, however, that the majority imposed on the analysis policy considerations against recovery as set out under the second branch of the test in <cite>Anns</cite> and <cite>Nielson</cite>. In addition, the eventual decision to award recovery in the case rested on the extreme proximity of the plaintiff and the injured property; they
were held to have constituted a `common adventure.' The facts of the case were also distinguishable from those of the waterway blocking cases involving a large number of plaintiffs, such as <cite>Bethlehem Steel</cite>. Finally, the strong dissent on the part of La Forest J. suggests that a similar case might receive different treatment if it came before a slightly different court.
<p>
In the end, <cite>Norsk</cite> only drives the Canadian law deeper into uncertainty. The `common adventure' reasoning of the majority makes it doubtful that plaintiffs in blocking cases such as <cite>Bethlehem Steel</cite> would have a stronger chance of recovery, as most blocking cases are comprised of plaintiffs with no interest whatever in property the defendant has damaged. In fact, on its reasoning, <cite>Norsk</cite> does not even directly contradict <cite>Gypsum Carrier</cite>, in that none of the railways in that case appear to have had the
relationship with the bridge that the court would now  require. Yet, it does reject the exclusionary rule against economic losses, opting instead for a case-by-case approach. In Canada, then, a claimant for relational economic losses caused by blocking can expect to have to satisfy an easier test than a similar claimant in England or the
U.S., but only marginally so; the principles of duty, proximity, and reasonable foreseeability are likely to be applied with extremely high thresholds.
<p>
<i>Analysis</i><br>
It is difficult to criticize the court's concern for indeterminate liability in cases such as these; the possible number
of parties affected by a blockage of the St. Lawrence Seaway, for example, could hardly be more indeterminate. Moreover, if the practice of awarding damages in individual claims were to become prevalent, the number of such claimants could be expected to increase exponentially in comparison to the number of claimants seen in the
current cases.
<p>
It may very well be that the correct policy decision to avoid these situations is to apply the exclusionary rule against all such claims. This would provide certainty of liability to all parties involved, who could then make provision against the potential for such losses. The cost of this approach, however, can be injustice to the plaintiff in the individual action. The major difficulty with a rule excluding recovery for all claims is the desire of individual courts to get around the rule to prevent injustices in their decisions.
<p.
There are possible alternatives. One alternative would be distinguishing between the different varieties of blocking cases. As shown, the situation in <cite>Norsk</cite> and <cite>Caltex</cite> is much different from <cite>Kinsman II</cite>, for example, especially in terms of the possibility for indeterminate liability. Perhaps it would be possible to differentiate between the two situations, with the exclusionary rule applying only to the latter. The difficulty would, of course, be establishing the parameters for such a distinction. The physical differences between the location of the potential plaintiffs would not suffice. While the `bridge cases' of <cite>Norsk</cite> and <cite>Gypsum Carrier</cite> involved a small defined set of potential claimants in the users of the damaged bridge, it would be equally possible for a busy highway bridge to be damaged in the same way; the number of potential claimants could possibly exceed even those of the seaway blocking cases. Instead, perhaps the number of potential claimants itself could be the key; where they are contained in a small defined set, such as railway bridge users, the exclusionary rule should be avoided.
<p>
Yet a closer examination of the jurisprudence on blocking cases reveals that special alternate theories or approaches may be entirely unnecessary. Instead, the solution may be to abandon the exclusionary rule altogether in all blocking cases, in favour of general application of negligence doctrines. The recent trend towards a tort analysis for blocking cases appears to hold promise as a viable alternative to the exclusionary rule. Despite a number of decisions applying standards of duty, foreseeability, and proximity to blocking cases, there has been no opening of the floodgates to liability. Instead, the approach of the courts has been to set the thresholds for these tests at such a high level that potential liability is restricted to reasonable limits. Cases such as <cite>Kinsman II</cite> and <cite>Gypsum Carrier</cite> demonstrate that a relaxation of the exclusionary rule in favour of a tort analysis will often create the same result as if the exclusionary rule still applied.<sup><a href="#onehundred">100</a></sup> It does, however, give the courts the flexibility to address perceived injustices. This flexibility simply does not exist under a strict rule against recovery.
<p>
On this approach, there would only be two areas for concern, both of which are not unique to blocking cases: the loss of certainty provided by the exclusionary rule; and the determination of the exact threshold for the negligence doctrines of proximity or foreseeability. Both of these issues are common to all of the areas of maritime economic loss which this article has addressed; their treatment will therefore be left to the conclusion.

<h3>IV.  The Not-So-Limited Significance of Limited Liability</h3>

IV.1   INTRODUCTION
<p>
Up to this point, relational economic loss and maritime law have been discussed in terms of the initial establishment of liability in tortfeasors. It has been argued that instead of blindly applying the exclusionary rule against liability for relational economic loss damages, the rule can be relaxed in certain situations on the basis of considerations unique to maritime law. Liability may instead be determined on a case-by-case basis with the standard for recovery being determined by a form of negligence analysis, as if the damages experienced had been related to physical or personal injuries and not solely economic losses. The result would be that a tortfeasor would be liable for the damage actually done by his or her act, and would not be able to escape liability solely on the basis of the nature of the relationship between the parties to which he or she has caused losses.
<p>
In making this argument, it has been assumed for simplicity that a tortfeasor would be liable in full for whatever damages were awarded by the courts. This assumption is in fact the basis of Cardozo C.J.'s fear of indeterminate liability, one of the driving factors behind the exclusionary rule. In any other sphere of the common law this
would indeed be the case: the liability of the tortfeasor is limited only by the size of the damage awards permitted by the court. It is on this point that the common law and maritime law differ in dramatic fashion. One of the unique features of maritime law is that it gives certain defendants, including shipowners, the ability to limit their liability.<sup><a href="#one01">101</a></sup> The implication of this feature is that, apart from the arguments explored above, it raises serious questions about the justification for a rule excluding recovery for relational economic loss in maritime law.
<p>
IV.2   HISTORY OF LIMITED LIABILITY
<p>
The concept of limiting the liability of shipowners for the actions of their vessels is hundreds of years old.<sup><a href="#one02">102</a></sup> Its widespread adoption in Europe originated in the desire to promote shipping and
the investment in ships during the colonial periods of the European powers. It was deemed to be unfair to shipowners, and therefore bad for the shipping business, that shipowners could be held liable in tort for any and all damages his ship may negligently cause on its voyages. The unfairness stemmed from the fact that the negligence
would most often be caused by the crew of the ship and not by the shipowner personally; yet the latter would be liable for all damages. These damages could easily result in the bankruptcy of the shipowners.<sup><a href="#one03">103</a></sup> To make investment in owning and operating ships attractive, it was therefore necessary to do something to reduce this unpredictable and sizable risk. To deal with this problem, European countries quickly moved to adopt a system for limiting liability for shipowners. In 1733, England passed legislation which limited liability in certain situations; but it was not until the 19th century that this protection was extended to liability created by collisions.<sup><a href="#one04">104</a></sup> 
<p>
In modern times, this principle has been retained as a matter of convenience. Modern communication technology now means that shipowners no longer send ships to sea without any control whatsoever over their activities. As well, the countries which originally passed such legislation are no longer concerned with encouraging ship
building as a function of empire-building. The driving force behind the retention of the concept of limited liability has been the convenience of the rule in the insurance market. The attractiveness of the system of limited liability to shipowners and their insurers is that the total potential liability of a vessel can be calculated by the parties in advance. This arrangement permits the parties to have some certainty regarding the risk involved in insuring the
vessel.<sup><a href="#one05">105</a></sup> Without such certainty, the process of obtaining insurance for a vessel would unquestionably be more difficult and less efficient. It is these practical considerations in the efficient operation of the world maritime insurance market which have been the motivation behind a number of international conventions limiting liability of shipowners in negligence,<sup><a href="#one06">106</a></sup> including
the <cite>International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to the Limitation of Liability of Owners of Seagoing Vessels</cite>,<sup><a href="#one07">107</a></sup> the <cite>International Convention Relating to the Limitation of Liability of Owners of Seagoing Ships</cite>,<sup><a href="#one08">108</a></sup> and the <cite>1976 Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims</cite>.<sup><a href="#one09">109</a></sup> 
<p>
These conventions set out a system for determining who has access to the ability to limit losses, when this right can be exercised, and how the limitation amount is calculated and distributed. For years the 1957 Convention set these standards globally: most maritime nations, including Canada, were signatories (Canada has not ratified the Convention but has instead given effect to its provisions through amendments to the Canada <cite>Shipping Act</cite>.<sup><a href="#one10">110</a></sup>). Under this Convention, shipowners are able to limit liability for damages in tort or contract if they can establish that the act in question occurred without the owner's `actual fault or privity.'<sup><a href="#one11">111</a></sup> If the shipowner is successful, their total potential liability is limited to a maximum amount. Any and all claims for damages are then paid out of this amount: if the aggregate claims exceed this total, the claims are paid on a pro rated basis. Two such limitation amounts are calculated. The first amount relates to damages from loss of life or personal injury. The second amount relates to damages arising from damage to property. The basis for these calculations is the gross tonnage of the shipowner's vessel: the larger the vessel, the greater the shipowner's liability before it can benefit from any limitation. The formula for calculating the exact amount of liability is extremely complex; the end result in Canada under the <cite>Shipping Act</cite> is a maximum liability for loss of life and personal injury of $310 per ton, and a maximum liability for property  damage of $100 per ton.<sup><a href="#one12">112</a></sup>
<p>
Up to the middle of this century, liability for damages was readily awarded by common law courts around the world. Plaintiffs faced an `almost impossible task' of showing the necessary level of owner involvement to avoid limited liability.<sup><a href="#one13">113</a></sup> Extreme results in a number of decisions at that time, however, began to change attitudes. Courts in England and Canada became much more reluctant to grant limited liability to shipowners.<sup><a href="#one14">114</a></sup> In fact, Canadian jurisprudence took a dramatic enough dislike to limited liability that it could be argued the doctrine was dead in Canada.<sup><a href="#one15">115</a></sup>
<p>
One of the reasons put forward for this reluctance was the perception that the amounts set under the 1957 Convention were too low. The trend in the jurisprudence away from limited liability exerted pressure within the industry to revise the standards in its availability and calculation. The result of this pressure was the 1976 Convention noted above. Under this convention a new balance between liability and limitation was struck.<sup><a href="#one16">116</a></sup> Article 4 provides that limitation of liability is now only unavailable where the losses can be proven to have resulted from the personal act or omission of the shipowner, committed either with the intention to cause the loss or recklessly with the knowledge that the loss may occur. The result is that it is now much easier for defendants to benefit from limited liability.<sup><a href="#one17">117</a></sup> For the benefits of plaintiffs, however, the threshold for limitation of liability is now much higher.<sup><a href="#one18">118</a></sup> While neither Canada not the U.S. are signatories to this 1976 Convention and have not
adopted its terms, there are indications that Canada may do so before the turn of the century.<sup><a href="#one19">119</a></sup>
<p>
IV.3   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND RELATIONAL ECONOMIC LOSS
<p>
In the context of economic loss, the availability of limited liability immediately raises an important question: what
purpose is served by applying an exclusionary rule against such losses?  As has been discussed above a number of times, the <cite>Cattle</cite> principle of excluding economic loss was founded on the principle of avoiding liability of the defendant to an indeterminate number of parties for an indeterminate amount because of a single act
of negligence. Yet if shipowners and other defendants in maritime economic loss cases have the potential to limit their liability through other statutorily-approved means, the principal reason for the exclusionary rule disappears. People with statutorily limited liability have no need for a protection against unlimited liability. In other words, application of the exclusionary rule to relational economic loss claims in maritime law against shipowners is a
duplication of protection. Even if the exclusionary rule is removed and replaced with a negligence standard which applied no stricter test to economic losses than to physical or personal losses, shipowners will in most circumstances never suffer exposure to Cardozo C.J.'s `indeterminate liability.' Their total liability instead will be fixed and determinable ahead of time, meaning most importantly that they will still have full access to insurance for
their losses.
<p>
Surprisingly, this factor has received little consideration in the jurisprudence. Despite the fact that the cases focus on negligence and the recovery of damages, the cases rarely spend much, if any, time discussing the fact that the defendant shipowner most likely has access to the protection of limited liability.<sup><a href="#one20">120</a></sup> Even in the larger cases, the presence of limited liability means that awarding complete
recovery for all property and relational economic loss damage claims would only result in a right to a <i>pro rata</i> portion of a fund. It would have no effect upon the total liability of the defendant. It might be expected that this fact would alleviate court fears of indeterminate liability, as it quite simply prevents the shipowner from ever being so exposed. 
<p>
There are, however, a number of possible explanations for this failure to consider limited liability. Most cases focus upon the establishment of the initial liability, which is most often refused; therefore the question of whether the defendant would have access to limited liability never arises. In addition, it may simply be recognized by all the parties involved that any recovery will only be a portion of what is being claimed and, as such, it is not an issue
between them at trial. In other circumstances, there may be sufficient resources in the liability fund to cover the economic losses claimed. Finally, in Canada and the U.S. at least, where the 1976 Convention has not been adopted, the courts have recently made it increasingly difficult for shipowners to qualify for limited liability; therefore it may not be a factor in most cases at all.<sup><a href="#one21">121</a></sup>
<p>
There may be another justifiable reason for not awarding economic loss damages even in the presence of limited liability. Not awarding such damages may be required to protect claimants for physical damages against having their recovery reduced, perhaps significantly, if claims for economic loss were permitted to rank with them in the distribution of the limited liability fund. The more claims allowed against the liability fund of a shipowner, the lower the amount that each claimant takes on a <i>pro rata</i> basis. Wholesale permission of economic loss claims has the potential to substantially reduce the recovery of the owners of the property with which the action originated. If these parties are prevented from recovering sufficient amounts to pay for repairs to the property damaged, and those repairs are delayed or foregone as a result, then the economic loss damages caused by the accident would only be exacerbated. It may therefore be in the interest of all parties to permit at least particular property claimants to recover as much of their damages as possible. Yet there are two points on which to question this approach. The first is that it characterizes economic loss claims as secondary or subservient to those for physical damage, an idea which is not supported in the jurisprudence. Secondly, granting every kind of claim equal standing with in relation to the liability fund results in a situation which is no different from other areas of the law where the assets available do not satisfy all the judgments against a defendant.
<p>
The shipowners' access to limited liability raises issues in economic loss which are faced only in maritime law. By providing a ceiling on the total liability payable by a defendant, limited liability appears in many ways to duplicate the protection provided by the exclusionary rule against the recovery in economic loss developed at common law.
By doing so, it provides another reason for arguing that, at the least, the protections of the exclusionary rule can be relaxed in maritime law.
<p>
<h3>V.  Conclusion</h3>

Until relatively recently, any party suffering economic loss enjoyed a state of relative certainty regarding their prospects of recovery: there were no such prospects at common law. All common law jurisdictions applied the exclusionary rule against such losses, alternatively formulated in <cite>Cattle</cite> or <cite>Robins</cite>, with
strict regularity. Their main motivating factor was the avoidance of indeterminable liability for huge numbers of claims which could theoretically arise from the same transaction. The strict application of the exclusionary rule provided, at least in theory, the parties who would be susceptible to such losses with the motivation to protect themselves against the losses, through vehicles such as insurance.
<p>
The cost of this certainty, however, was the injustice it could create in individual cases, or in certain situations. As we have seen, the situations of time and voyage charterers, other third parties contractually related to a vessel, and those affected by the blocking of transportation routes all have varying potential to render the application of the exclusionary rule unjust to those suffering the loss. This injustice in the application of the global rule to individual situations has been the motivation for courts to attempt to avoid the rule and to seek alternatives on a case-by-case
basis. As a result, one of the major difficulties with the exclusionary rule has been inconsistency in its general application by courts who do not like its particular results>

In searching for these alternatives, courts in the U.S., Canada, and Australia have discovered that it is possible to abandon the exclusionary rule without opening the floodgates to indeterminate liability. Instead of strictly disallowing liability, these courts have been gradually and nominally adopting the same standards for assessing liability for relational economic damages as for physical damages in negligence: duty, foreseeability, and proximity.
Admittedly, these courts and others have only been able to agree that different or modified standards of these tests need to be applied to maintain the balance between recovery and indeterminate liability. As yet, they have not been able to formulate a threshold test which has gained approval by even a slim majority of judges. Yet this does not
mean that such a test does not exist, and even if one is never found, it may simply indicate that there should be different tests for different fact situations. It is not appropriate, however, to `throw the baby out with the bath water' as the House of Lords attempted to do in <cite>Murphy</cite>, by attempting to end the debate with a strict reversion to the exclusionary rule. 
<p>
In any other area of the common law, the relaxation of the exclusionary rule would result in dramatically increased uncertainty about the liability generated from any given act of negligence. Even if high thresholds for the elements of negligence were introduced, to protect the defendant from being unfairly victimized as a result of others' losses, this liability could still be extensive and unpredictable. In maritime law, access to limited liability alleviates this problem. It separates the liability actually proven against the defendant from the amount that the defendant will
actually have to pay. The latter is the only concern of the maritime law defendant once the limitation threshold has been reached. After that point, further findings of liability only determine the number of parties who have access to that limitation amount. The advantage of the system is that this amount will still be determinable ahead of time with the same certainty as it is today, making insurance equally determinable. Removing the exclusionary rule will therefore not cause the defendant to suffer increased financial uncertainty regarding the liability for damages. Instead, the uncertainty will relate to the size of the share of this fund collected by claimants who would have no recovery under the exclusionary rule. 
<p>
In conclusion, the maritime context presents enough unique considerations to justify reconsidering the application of the common law bar to recovery of economic losses in this context. Yet it is apparent that the problems and issues posed by economic loss in the maritime context will not be resolved quickly by anything short of the establishment of an international convention and subsequent adoption of its rules by all common law countries. While legislation on the topic in individual jurisdictions may at least improve certainty in the area, it will most likely only confuse the marine operator regularly operating between such jurisdictions. As it stands now, marine operators still generally expect not to recover for claims for economic losses in the U.S., England, Canada, or Australia. The chance of success is greater now than it was a decade ago, however, especially in the latter two countries, and it may be that in the near future we will see recovery for relational economic losses become a regular occurrence in maritime law.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

Point of sale electronic funds transfer (EFT-POS) transactions are an increasingly popular means of consumer payment in Canada.<sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup> Similarly, automated teller machines (ATMs) are now widely used.<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup> While the volume of consumer electronic funds transfer (EFT) transactions does not yet rival the volume of cheque transactions,<sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup> the moment is approaching. However, despite the convenience and efficiency of EFT, under the present legal framework the consumer might well be advised to be wary of the use of it. 
<p>
It will be shown that there is a clear need for regulation of risk allocation in cases of consumer EFT fraud in Canada. While the common law appears inadequate to the task, there are several possible models for the regulation of EFT. Keeping the two goals of a secure banking system and an efficient amount of loss compensation in mind, this paper looks at the solutions attempted in both the United States and Australia before moving to a brief analysis of which approach is more suited to the Canadian situation.
<p>
<h3>Cheque Fraud</h3>

Before examining EFT fraud, it is appropriate to gloss over the corresponding situation with respect to cheques. There are two basic types of forgeries which can be performed with cheques. These are alterations to the body of the cheque, such as an increase in the amount payable or a change in the name of the payee, and forged signatures. The signature forged can be that of the drawer or can be an endorsement. For the purposes of comparison, only the
forgery of the drawer's signature is relevant.
<p>
Cheques, as a means of payment, are regulated by the <cite>Bills of Exchange Act</cite>.<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup> The general rule under the <cite>Act</cite> is that the bank bears the risk of fraud. Section 49(1) of the <cite>Act</cite> is designed to protect the purported drawer from forgery and provides that a forged signature is wholly inoperative. Later subsections modify this slightly by requiring notice of the forgery within one year and by permitting ratification of an unauthorized signature which does not amount to a forgery.<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup> Thus, when a customer's signature is forged on a cheque, subject to the requirement of reasonable notice and the common law estoppel which may operate against the customer by virtue of his negligence,
the bank<sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup> bears the risk and is not entitled to debit the customer's account.<sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup>
<p>
<h3>EFT Fraud</h3>

By contrast, consumer EFT is largely unregulated in Canada. The rights and responsibilities of the parties are subject only to the contract between them. The result is that the risk of fraud and forgery rests almost entirely on the consumer.
<p>
EFT fraud is surprisingly simple. The most common scheme runs as follows. The criminal waits in a vehicle or at some other vantage point near an ATM and observes (perhaps through binoculars) the bank customer entering the PIN. Alternatively, a video camera could be located near the ATM. The criminal records the PIN. If at the end
of the transaction, the customer drops the printed transaction receipt to the ground, the criminal notes the time and picks up the accumulated transactions records a short time later. This receipt will record the time and may, depending on bank policy, record the card number and the account balance. If the card number is recorded on the slip, the technology to encode cards is relatively simple; given the card number, a sophisticated criminal can easily obtain an encoded card. Having obtained a number of `forged' cards and their corresponding PINs, the criminal is free to proceed with the actual fraud. This is usually done over a long weekend, when the account holder is less likely to detect the fraud. Subject to the daily withdrawal limit, the criminal and his associates then proceed to
empty a number of accounts. By the first business day following the long weekend, when presumably the fraud is detected, the criminals are generally in another country, beyond the effective reach of Canadian criminal law.<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup> In England, several other variations have been reported. Thieves have built dummy fronts to cover the PIN keyboard, allowing recording of the PIN. There are even records of dummy ATM machines being built and designed to keep the card and record the PIN attempted.<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup>
<p>
It may also be possible to penetrate the system electronically. There are no publicly recorded instances of success, but one must question if the banks might be tempted to handle such a breach of security internally, in view of the possible negative consequences of the adverse publicity. Michael Oke, a bank security expert, stated in 1989 that &quot;(t)he potential for large scale frauds is significant and will become enormous when global funds transfer and retail EFT/point of sale systems become widespread.&quot;<sup><a href="#ten">10</a></sup> Both of these are now a reality. The solution to this danger is advanced computer encryption, a subject outside the current legal
analysis.<sup><a href="#eleven">11</a></sup>
<p>
While the above discussion deals primarily with fraud related to ATM cash machines, the problem is only exacerbated with relation to EFT-POS transactions. While ATM user etiquette demands a certain distance between customers in a line (thus minimizing the opportunity to view another customer's PIN), no such distance is possible in the typical EFT-POS transaction. The retail clerk is often close enough to see the customer entering the PIN. The clerk also has temporary access to the customer's card, allowing the card number to be viewed and memorized. The store employee could then obtain a forged card and use it in the manner outlined above, either at an ATM or in
fraudulent EFT-POS transactions. 
<p>
EFT-POS also makes electronic fraud easier. The physical security of an ATM is generally high, making it difficult to tap into the proper communication lines. By contrast, the typical EFT-POS terminal is composed of a card reader and PIN keypad wired to a base unit by exposed telephone cable. It would be a simple matter for a computer-literate criminal to tap the telephone cable and obtain the required information from a wiretap under the counter of the sales desk.<sup><a href="#twelve">12</a></sup>
<p>
<h3>The Relative Difficulty of Cheque and EFT Fraud</h3>

Having examined some of the types of fraud which can be perpetrated with cheques and with ATMs, let us now examine the relative difficulty. Cheque fraud requires a blank cheque, either stolen from the customer or forged. At one time, a signature sample of the drawer was required, but the present clearing system, where the drawee bank is likely to provisionally pay on the cheque without ever comparing it to a signature sample,<sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup> reduces the requirement for a signature sample. The most common form of EFT-POS fraud requires only the ATM receipt and an opportunity to view the PIN being entered. Some equipment is also
needed to duplicate the card. The conclusion to be drawn from this comparison is that cheque fraud is relatively easy to perform on a small scale, while electronic fraud requires a larger amount of technology and organization. 
<p>
However, banks today generally practice conservative banking practices to reduce cheque fraud (holding a cheque depositor's funds, only cashing cheques for customers, etc.) in order to reduce the amount of fraud which is successful. One reason why banks take these precautions is that the <cite>Bills of Exchange Act</cite> puts
almost all of the risk of cheque forgery on the bank. The bank, as a profit-maximizing enterprise, is motivated to reduce the amount of cheque fraud because it alone bears the cost.
<p>
<h3>Canadian Legislation Dealing with EFT Fraud</h3>

In the case of EFT fraud, there is no federal statutory allocation of the losses from fraud,<sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup> although there is some provincial legislation. Using British Columbia as an example,
there is the <cite>Consumer Protection Act</cite>,<sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup> which at one
time was assumed by lawyers to apply to some EFT transactions. In the case of theft or loss of a credit card, s. 31 of the <cite>Act</cite> limits the liability of the card holder to fifty dollars for any unauthorized transactions prior to notification of the issuer, and excuses the holder entirely from liability for any unauthorized transactions entered into after the issuer has been notified. &quot;Credit card&quot; is defined in the act to be:
<blockquote>
a card, document or similar instrument, or a replacement or renewal of any of them, by which on a continuing basis and from time to time goods and services or credit may be obtained on deferred payment, or by any means of which cash may be obtained, whether or not there is any cost of borrowing or default charge for the credit or cash.<sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup>
</blockquote>
This definition would appear to cover ATM and EFT-POS transactions.<sup><a href="#seventeen">17</a></sup> However, the former British Columbia County Court considered just this issue in <cite>Plater v. Bank of Montreal</cite>.<sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup> In that case, the customer lost his wallet which contained both his Master Card and PIN. The Master Card had arrived unsolicited. Before he had the opportunity to notify the bank, several cash advances were obtained using ATMs. In a decision almost devoid of analysis, the court considered the application of the <cite>Consumer Protection Act</cite> and decided that: &quot;[t]he use (and misuse) of the credit card-PIN combination is an operation separate and distinct from the use of the credit card alone to obtain goods or services, or cash advances . . .&quot;<sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a></sup> and that, as a result, s. 31 of the <cite>Act</cite> was not applicable to EFT. The court proceeded to apply the liability provision of the cardholder agreement. In doing so, the court relied on <cite>Villemure v. Master Card (Division Banque de Montreal)</cite><sup><a href="#twenty">20</a></sup> where the court declined to apply the Quebec equivalent of the <cite>Consumer Protection Act</cite>.<sup><a href="#twenty1">21</a></sup>
<p>
Even if the <cite>Act</cite> were changed in an attempt to make it clearly applicable to consumer EFT transactions, there remains a constitutional issue. In so far as the Act might be applied to ATM transactions, it is probably <i>ultra vires</i> the province. The power to regulate banking is an exclusively federal power.<sup><a href="#twenty2">22</a></sup> The federal government was also given the power to regulate all of the payment
mechanisms in existence at the time of Confederation.<sup><a href="#twenty3">23</a></sup> A broad and purposive reading of the Constitution would extend these powers to the regulation of new payment modes.<sup><a href="#twenty4">24</a></sup> While the provincial power to regulate creditor-debtor relationships could be used to permit some provincial legislation in the area, federal law would be paramount.<sup><a href="#twenty5">25</a></sup> It might be argued that federal regulation would not apply to provincial institutions like credit unions or trust companies, but this is a confusion of the financial institution and the payment system within which the institution operates.
<p>
<h3>The Common Law of EFT Fraud</h3>

In the absence of federal regulation, the rights of the parties are left to the common law and are covered by the contract between the bank and the customer. As one might expect from standard form or adhesion contracts,<sup><a href="#twenty6">26</a></sup> these allocate the risk to the customer. The most common provision is one which makes the customer liable for all unauthorized withdrawals made before the notification of the bank.<sup><a href="#twenty7">27</a></sup> In practice, this means that the customer is liable for the full amount of his bank balance, plus any overdraft facilities, as the criminal in the scheme outlined above would be able to empty the account over the long weekend before the customer would even be aware of the use of the forged card. The only possible mitigating factor for the customer would be the possibility that the bank might be willing to absorb the loss in the interest of good customer relations.<sup><a href="#twenty8">28</a></sup> It might be expected that this would most often occur if the client was a long-term client with substantial dealings with the bank. The banks certainly can be expected to rely on their legal rights and remedies in a large number of cases of unauthorized transactions.
<p>
Faced with the institution's refusal to make good her loss or its insistence that she repay the unauthorized overdraft, the customer will have to fall back on her common law rights. There are several general problems with relying on the common law in these types of situations. The first difficulty stems from the sums of money involved. Since few people keep more than a few thousand dollars in their current account and banks generally have withdrawal limits on ATM or EFT-POS transactions, any individual's loss from consumer EFT fraud is likely to be small. This means
that the consumer is unlikely to be able to retain counsel for an amount commensurate with the possible recovery. As a result, the consumer will have to present her own case. In view of the common law rules to be discussed, a consumer faced with counsel from the bank would be in a difficult position. 
<p>
Another problem is that these amounts place the case within the monetary jurisdiction of the small claims court in most jurisdictions.<sup><a href="#twenty9">29</a></sup> With respect, many small claims judges have limited exposure to banking and commercial law matters and rely on counsel to provide guidance. In the absence of counsel for the customer, the only guidance will come from counsel for the financial institution---hardly the ideal from the customer's perspective. The small claims court jurisdiction will generally also result in the decision not being reported. This means that a body of precedent will not develop, leaving each successive case to be built on first principles.<sup><a href="#thirty">30</a></sup> There are also some difficult problems of evidence. When the bank controls all of the documentary evidence of the relevant transactions, it is very difficult for the litigant customer to do any more than assert that he did not make the impugned withdrawal.<sup><a href="#thirty1">31</a></sup> While this problem could be avoided by the proper use of discovery and interrogatories<sup><a href="#thirty2">32</a></sup>, one must question the ability of a lay litigant to use these devices.
<p>
The second problem arises from the scope of actual common law remedies available. For ease of analysis, assume that the fraud complained of was perpetrated using a card number governed by the Bank of Nova Scotia Cashstop/Transaction Cardholder Agreement. While terms may vary from institution to institution, this agreement
is broadly representative of those used by other banks. In the event of any fraudulent use of the card, the bank will rely on clause 9 of the agreement to shift all of the liability to the card holder. This clause provides that:
<blockquote>
You are liable for all indebtedness, withdrawals and account activity resulting from your use of the card including all indebtedness, withdrawals and account activity by persons to whom you have made the card and/or PIN available. You are liable for all unauthorized use of the Card and/or PIN (including indebtedness, withdrawals and account activity arising from unauthorized use of the Card and PIN where the Card and the PIN have been kept together or in such a manner as to make them available for use together) until we have received notice of loss, theft or unauthorized use. You will notify us immediately of the loss, theft or any unauthorized use of the Card or the PIN. Your liability will cease only when notice of loss, theft or unauthorized use is received by us.
</blockquote>
If a court upholds this clause, the customer is liable for any unauthorized withdrawals. It might be possible to attack the whole agreement on the basis of non-disclosure or unconscionability.<sup><a href="#thirty3">33</a></sup> Although the applicant signs that he has received the agreement, this is not necessarily the case. If the customer is prepared to swear that he was never given the agreement,<sup><a href="#thirty4">34</a></sup> a court might be willing to decline to apply the clause under the <i>non est factum</i> doctrine.
<p>
If the court could be persuaded not to enforce the written agreement, either on the basis of <i>non est factum</i> or general unconscionability,<sup><a href="#thirty5">35</a></sup> the customer would then have to argue that
the loss was caused by the bank's negligence. He would have to assert that the bank was negligent in designing the ATM terminal or EFT-POS keypad in such a way as to allow the criminal to see the PIN and negligent in providing a full paper record of the card number.<sup><a href="#thirty6">36</a></sup> Even if this were possible, it would still lead to a finding of contributory negligence, at least under the ATM fraud outlined above, as the customer should have kept his transaction record in order to prevent the fraud. If the fraud took place as a result of an EFT-POS transaction, it might be easier to avoid a finding of contributory negligence.
<p>
Given the likelihood of lay litigants, these sorts of common law remedies are not satisfactory. Even if the law were such that a successful case could be made for the customer (and it is not at all clear that this is so), the difficulty of presenting such arguments would often prevent the unrepresented customer's success. Consumers are assisted to some degree by the relaxation of procedure in small claims court, but this is not enough.<sup><a href="#thirty7">37</a></sup> The complexity of the substantive common law itself is a barrier to access, as is the need for litigation.<sup><a href="#thirty8">38</a></sup> There is clearly a need for some other mechanism. The consumer would be better protected by a clear right. If there were definite legislation, the bank would pay the claims (or some statutory portion thereof) directly to the customer, and litigation would be avoided. This would be in the bank's best interest as well. Surely, banks must be unhappy with paying $400 to defend a $500 claim in small claims court, where legal costs may not be recoverable.
<p>
<h3>The American Legislative Model of EFT Regulation</h3>

There are several jurisdictions where consumer EFT is regulated. Turn first to the American statutory solution to the problem of risk allocation with respect to electronic funds transfer fraud. In 1978, Congress passed the <cite>Electronic Funds Transfer Act</cite> or <cite>EFTA</cite>.<sup><a href="#thirty9">39</a></sup> The <cite>Act</cite>, which purports to cover all electronic financial transactions, has several provisions dealing specifically with ATM and EFT-POS fraud. The <cite>EFTA</cite> also allowed the creation of regulations in the area, including Regulation E which covers consumer EFT.<sup><a href="#forty">40</a></sup>
<p>
The <cite>EFTA</cite> is the result of pressure from American consumer advocates, who stressed the need for protection against the power of financial institutions to contractually limit their risk exposure. American financial industry representatives, of course, took the position that regulation was unnecessary and that unauthorized use
was always the result of negligence on the customer's part.<sup><a href="#forty1">41</a></sup> Despite the lobbying efforts of the financial services sector, the final legislation was generally favourable to the consumer advocate's position.
<p>
Section 1693g of the <cite>EFTA</cite> provides that the consumer is liable for unauthorized transactions made with the card and some means of identification (with present technology, a PIN). However, this liability is limited to the lesser of fifty dollars or the sum withdrawn before the customer notifies the financial institution of the loss of the card or of the existence of unauthorized transactions. If the customer does not report the loss of the card within two days of knowledge, or does not report unauthorized transactions within sixty days, he may be liable for greater amounts.<sup><a href="#forty2">42</a></sup>
<p>
The American courts have since interpreted the statute and regulation liberally to give wide protection to the consumer. In <cite>Russell v. First Am. Bank-Mich., N.A.</cite>,<sup><a href="#forty3">43</a></sup> the court held that the bank could not contractually expand the customer's liability beyond the <cite>EFTA</cite>. In that case, the customer wrote the PIN down and gave it to her daughter with the card. The daughter told her mother that the card had been stolen. When Mrs. Russell reported the theft to the bank $310 had already been debited. The court held that neither the plaintiff's nor her daughter's negligence would deny the plaintiff recovery. Not even the plaintiff's breach of the cardholder contract (which provided that the card was not to be kept with the PIN) could
prevent the customer's recovery of funds from the bank.<sup><a href="#forty4">44</a></sup>
<p>
The importance of the availability of evidence has already been noted. The <cite>EFTA</cite> provides that the burden of proof is on the financial institution throughout. If a customer questions the validity of a transaction, the onus shifts to the bank to prove that the transaction was authorized.<sup><a href="#forty5">45</a></sup>
<p>
<h3>The Australian `Soft Law' Approach to EFT Fraud Regulation</h3>

Another possible model for the regulation of EFT fraud is the Australian model.<sup><a href =  "#forty6">46</a></sup> The same concerns enumerated above led the Australian federal government to form a &quot;Working Group Examining the Rights and Obligations of Users and Providers of Electronic Funds Transfer
Systems.&quot;  In conjunction with the Consumer Affairs Ministers of the various states, the Federal Government Working Group issued a report recommending changes in the law governing EFT.<sup><a href="#forty7">47</a></sup> Their approach is very different, at least in form, from the American one. 
<p>
Consider the form of the recommendations. The Working Group did not recommend legislation, but gave the banks a list of suggestions to guide their contractual interactions with their customers. A Code of Conduct was released by the federal and state governments, with the strong suggestion that legislation would follow if the recommendations in the code were not met.<sup><a href="#forty8">48</a></sup> The Code of Conduct is periodically reviewed to
allow for new developments.<sup><a href="#forty9">49</a></sup> This system appears to have been successful in Australia. Of the approximately 430 million transactions in 1990, about 6,000 complaints were made about unauthorized transactions. Of these complaints, over half were settled in the customer's favour.<sup><a href="#fifty">50</a></sup>
<p>
Consider next the substance of the Australian recommendation on fraud. A consumer should not be liable for any loss over fifty dollars, unless she contributes to that loss. If she contributes, she is responsible for the actual loss.<sup><a href="#fifty1">51</a></sup> The imposition of this limited liability on the consumer, even if no contribution to the loss is shown, is defended on the ground that it provides an incentive for the consumer to take
care not to lose the card.<sup><a href="#fifty2">52</a></sup> The Australian Trade Practices Commission has also provided a dispute resolution mechanism for the settlement of EFT disputes.<sup><a href="#fifty3">53</a></sup>
<p>
<h3>Analysis of the Suitability of These Models to the Canadian Situation</h3>

Given that the present situation in Canada is unsatisfactory from the perspective of the informed consumer, which
of the several possible alternative risk allocation schemes is preferable?<sup><a href="#fifty4">54</a></sup> The <cite>Bills of Exchange Act</cite> cheque analogy would suggest putting all of the risk on the financial institution. However, this is less than satisfactory, at least from the institution's point of view, because of the differences in the technology. Assume that regulation is desirable if it improves efficiency in the economist's sense. In the case of a cheque, the bank is theoretically able to compare a forged cheque with a sample signature and detect forgery. Thus, it is arguably efficient to make the bank bear the risk because this will encourage the bank to prevent the forgery. With EFT, a fraudulently obtained PIN or electronic signature is identical to a bona fide PIN. If the bank is to use technically efficient online verification, the PIN is necessary<sup><a href="#fifty5">55</a></sup> and the risk of
unauthorized use cannot be completely prevented by the bank. While this paper has generally adopted a consumer perspective, the banks have legitimate system security interests which must be protected. The earlier discussion of the methods of fraud available make it clear that the banks' claim that all EFT fraud is the result of the customer's collusion or negligence is not valid. However, a portion of the control over the physical security of the system is in the customer's hands.<sup><a href="#fifty6">56</a></sup> The responsibility for electronic security rests entirely on the financial institution. Therefore, like the control over security, the risk should be shared between the customer and the institution. Presumably this will result in an efficiently<sup><a href="#fifty7">57</a></sup> low amount of fraud.
<p>
This risk-sharing should be an arbitrary split. If the risk is shared according to a fault standard, the problems of litigating small sums will simply recur in more definite form. There is a need for an essentially nonjudicial risk allocation.<sup><a href="#fifty8">58</a></sup> Because of the barriers to access, a common
law judicial system of loss compensation is not suitable.
<p>
The American and Australian approach of limiting customer risk to fifty dollars is a good one. This places a sufficiently high onus on the customer to encourage him to safeguard his card and PIN. At the same time the remaining risk encourages the bank to take more security measures. For example, omitting part of the card number on the transaction receipt would prevent the execution of the most popular EFT fraud scheme. Yet only some of the
financial institutions surveyed by the author have taken this simple step, and their customers are still at risk when they use other banks' machines. As well, a small plastic shield makes it considerably more difficult for the criminal to observe the PIN being entered, yet few banks have taken this step. Putting part of the risk on the bank would provide the necessary impetus for these and other measures, as they become necessary. In the event that litigation becomes necessary under this system, the American approach of shifting the burden of proof to the bank is  reasonable, given the bank's control over the evidence, and should be adopted. There is no need to create a new dispute settlement body as was done in Australia. With a code of conduct in place, the rights and obligations of the parties will be clear and little litigation will be necessary. The small amount which will arise can certainly be
handled by the various small claims courts.
<p>
As a practical matter, the fragmentary nature of the American banking system made legislation necessary there. However, in Australia, with a Canadian style branch banking system, the government was able to use moral suasion on the small number of banks to convince them that the time was ripe to remove liability from the consumer. If possible, this soft law approach would seem to be preferable because it provides more flexibility and allows the easy introduction of new technology.<sup><a href="#fifty9">59</a></sup> The only question remains the willingness of the banks to be persuaded. The traditional position of the Canadian banks is that virtually all EFT fraud is the result of negligence or collusion on the part of the card holder.<sup><a href="#sixty">60</a></sup> However, using the Canadian Bankers Association and the Canadian Payment Association, it is possible that the federal
government could persuade the banks to change their practices voluntarily, especially in the face of threatened legislation. If the threat is not sufficient, then the government should proceed to implement the same recommendations through legislation and regulation.
<p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

Despite the need for a more efficient system to regulate the losses arising from consumer EFT fraud in Canada, no progress has been made toward this goal. The previous examination of the Australian and American systems of `soft law' and legislation leads to the conclusion that the federal government should begin negotiating with the financial institutions about the contents of a Canadian Code of Conduct. The government should insist that the Code contain a set division of liability. Only then will the informed consumer be comfortable carrying a bank card.

<h2><i>Macedonia</i>:  Cultural Right or Cultural Appropriation?

The dispute between Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, with respect to the use of the name <i>Macedonia</i> and the Vergina Sun symbol, serves to highlight lingering issues surrounding the status of culture in international law.  This paper represents, in part, a search for regimes with which to make cultural disputes legally intelligible.  Setting aside the fruitless historical debates, the author characterizes Macedonia's position as a claim to cultural identity in international law and evaluates this claim within the framework of self-determination, human rights, and peoples' rights.  Conversely, Greece's position is characterized as a claim of cultural protection, and is considered under the guise of cultural property law, international intellectual property law and cultural &quot;appropriation,&quot; as voiced by indigenous populations.  In the end, the Macedonian argument appears almost intuitive, while Greece's claim of a proprietary-type interest in the name and symbol seems to be beyond the scope of both international law and workable international policy.

<blockquote><dl>
<dt>&quot;What's in a name?&quot;
<dd>Shakespeare, <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>, 2.ii.43
</dl></blockquote>

The ongoing controversy between Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia over the latter's wish to be recognized by a name which allegedly remains a Greek designation, stands as one of the world's more curious conflicts. After breaking off from a disintegrating Yugoslavia with aspirations to achieve full, independent statehood, the would-be Macedonia has experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining international recognition.
By objecting to a name which it says remains for the exclusive use of its own northernmost province and amounts to an aggressive claim over Greek territory and an unwarranted theft of Greek national and cultural heritage, Greece has lobbied internationally in the hopes of forcing its young neighbour to reconsider the name <i>Macedonia</i>, along with its flag and certain constitutional provisions.
<p>
While perhaps a strange and unnecessary political debate in the eyes of the international community, questions which surround the controversy are nonetheless rather interesting when seen through the lens of international law. Who, for example, owns the name <i>Macedonia</i>?  This is a type of question with which international law, to date, has had great difficulty. Although concerns over forms of &quot;cultural appropriation&quot; have recently
been voiced by members of the world's indigenous populations, the dispute over the name <i>Macedonia</i> has brought these concerns over the control of cultural intangibles to a new, interstate level. The purpose of this comment is simply to attempt a preliminary exploration of legal structures which might be relevant in addressing the issue of collective interests in cultural intangibles, or &quot;cultural intellectual property,&quot; on the international level.
<p>
The scope of peoples' cultural rights is unfortunately a manifestly unclear area of international law, and one is
ever-conscious that in proposing legal categories which may accommodate these perceived needs one is perhaps running when one ought merely to walk. As yet, international law provides few quick-fix remedies for disputes between peoples or states. Nevertheless, I press onward and suggest that rights to culture, broadly stated, are bound up with desires for expression of identity or notions of property and preservation of heritage. Legal regimes such as those of self-determination, human rights and peoples' rights provide some justifications for a Macedonian nation seeking to express its cultural identity internationally. Correspondingly, existing cultural property law and international intellectual property law provide frameworks for evaluation of Greek national heritage claims. Admittedly, no current legal category presents immediate or complete answers. The current controversy, ironically,
has served in the case of Macedonia to question what was always assumed (i.e. the right to call one's collective self what one wished), and in the case of Greece, to ask new questions hitherto unknown to law (i.e. involving the exclusive control of history and heritage). While the conflict may well be an odd interstate irritation requiring quick resolution, it is hoped that the ensuing debate might be put to constructive use by providing frameworks for and eventual clarification of the content of rights and duties relating to culture in international law.
<p>
<h3>Current Events</h3>

As is no doubt customary, the facts, factors, and forces involved in the current Greek/Macedonian controversy are complex and likely only superficially evident at this time. A brief highlight of recent events must then suffice to establish the content of the dispute at hand.
<p>
In the final months of 1991, the Republic of Macedonia took steps to formalize its detachment from Yugoslavia and achieve sovereign and independent statehood. Buttressed by seventy-two per cent support in a national referendum, and the passage of a Constitutional Act based on principles of parliamentary democracy, the government of the Republic of Macedonia formally requested international recognition in December, 1991.<sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup> Recognition was, however, neither immediate nor automatic, but was contingent (as was the earlier request) on processes established by the European Community.<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup> On the
11th of January 1992, the Conference on Yugoslavia Arbitration Commission, established by the European Council, declared that, after recent amendments to the Macedonian constitution which ensured respect for other states' territory and sovereignty, the Republic of Macedonia satisfied the <cite>Guidelines on the Recognition of New States in Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union</cite><sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup> and the <cite>Declaration on Yugoslavia</cite>.<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup> Accordingly, the Commission declared that, given the Republic's renunciation of all territorial claims, &quot;the use of the name <i>Macedonia</i> cannot therefore imply any territorial claim against another State . . .&quot;<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup> 
<p>
Despite the Arbitration Commission's recommendation, recognition was slow in coming. A European Community member since 1981, Greece consistently vetoed any Council attempt to recognize the state, alleging that any use of the name <i>Macedonia</i> intimated territorial ambitions towards Greece's northern province of the same name and moreover amounted to cultural theft. In June 1992, the European Council bowed to Greek demands, acknowledged its fellow member state's supreme national interest, and declared its willingness to recognize the Republic only under a name which did not include the term <i>Macedonia</i>.<sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup> Not surprisingly, Macedonia refused the European invitation<sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup> and prepared to sit out an oil blockade engineered by Greece after allegations of sanction-busting leakage through the Republic into
Serbia.
<p>
The year 1993 brought with it some positive news for Macedonia, a nation still diplomatically anonymous and bearing with difficulty UN sanctions against Serbia, formerly Macedonia's largest trading partner. After the matter was referred to the United Nations, the Security Council unanimously recommended that the state be admitted to membership in the United Nations as &quot;the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&quot; (FYROM) pending the settlement of the dispute.<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup> Recognition by the International Monetary Fund and European financial sources followed.
<p>
Domestically, the Greek government nevertheless still responded to popular concern over what was termed the &quot;Skopje&quot; issue (in reference to the capital of the FYROM). Human Rights Watch/Helsinki reports that throughout the summer of 1993, freedom of expression was restricted for ethnic Macedonians in Greece's northern province and some Macedonian rights activists were prosecuted and convicted for peaceful expression of their views.<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup> Moreover, in October of that year the Socialist party under the leadership of Andreas Papandreou regained control of the Greek government and immediately took a hardline stance on the Macedonia question despite the assumption of diplomatic relations with Macedonia by six European Council members.<sup><a href="#ten">10</a></sup>
<p>
The events of 1994 did not serve to bring the matter significantly near conclusion. On February 16, perhaps in reaction to the United States' recognition of the Republic, as well as to domestic politics, Greece blockaded Macedonia by refusing it use of its port at Thessaloniki. Angered by Greece's embargo, the European Commission has initiated legal proceedings in the European Court of Justice. Although the Court refused a request for a temporary injunction in June of 1994 on the grounds that while the embargo hindered the movement of goods in Europe, it did not represent serious damage to the European Community, the final decision on the legality of the Greek blockade of Macedonia is still pending. Meanwhile, American peacekeeping troops have been sent under the auspices of the UN to monitor Macedonia's Serbian border in light of fears that the continuing violence in the former Yugoslavia will spill over into the Republic. Although Greece and Macedonia continue to talk, the impasse continues.
<p>
<h3>The Positions</h3>

While common wisdom has suggested that a good name is more desirable than great riches, one is perhaps somewhat surprised that Macedonia has embraced the concept so wholeheartedly. A landlocked nation of just over two million inhabitants, facing Greek sanctions on the south and a closed Serbian border to the north, and geographically located at the crossroads of rival regional nationalisms without a standing army, Macedonia is paying a price for its name and its existence.
<p>
Macedonia has adopted a stubborn position with regard to the name and historical symbol issue, bred of a desire to maintain an identity in the face of its Balkan neighbours. Living for centuries in the ancient region of Macedonia and residing in that part of the ancient territory which remains unclaimed, they are nothing if not Macedonian, they contend. In exercising their right to self-determination and independence they suggest that they, as a people, cannot identify themselves as anything other than <i>Macedonians</i>. The majority of the population of the state consider themselves ethnically Macedonian and speak a Macedonian language.
<p>
It is the existence of minorities in Macedonia, however, which has made the Republic even more disinclined to compromise with Greece on the name. Compound names such as <i>Slav Macedonia</i> are considered unacceptable in that they would fan the flames of ethnic tension. Minorities in Macedonia include a large ethnic
Albanian population (twenty to thirty per cent), Bulgarian-leaning factions and formerly-privileged and newly-insecure Serbs. Moreover, and related to this, the government argues that the citizens of the country decided in the September 1991 referendum for an independent and sovereign state under the name <i>Macedonia</i>, and any powers-that-be, domestic or international, must respect this fact.
<p>
Greece's position on Macedonia is somewhat more clearly articulated. In short, Greece objects to the use of the name <i>Macedonia</i>, the use of the Vergina Sun symbol on the FYROM's flag (a 16-rayed gold star associated with the ancient Royal Dynasty of Macedonia and found on Philip II's tomb), certain Macedonian constitutional provisions, and what it considers continuous hostile and irredentist propaganda directed towards its own northern
province which in itself compromises approximately one-half of what was Ancient Macedonian territory. Greece sees this behaviour as both a threat to its own territorial integrity and an appropriation of its history and culture.
<p>
The issue of territorial integrity is one with which international bodies are significantly acquainted, and it is not
surprising that much of the dialogue and debate has centered around this more tangible concern. While both the UN Security Council and European Community have stopped short of declaring the name <i>Macedonia</i> in itself a threat to peace and security or &quot;good-neighbourly&quot; relations,<sup><a href="#eleven">11</a></sup> Macedonia has continuously been required to give assurances that it considers its frontiers inviolable, has renounced any territorial claims against its neighbours, and has confirmed that it will refrain from hostile propaganda and meddling in the internal affairs of other states.<sup><a href="twelve">12</a></sup> Still smarting from Yugoslav incursions into northern Greece during Greece's civil war period in the 1940s, Greece sees the use of the name and flag as symbols of continuing expansionist visions and considers discussions of a separate Macedonian identity to be expansionist propaganda. Moreover, constitutional references to traditions and decisions of earlier Macedonian political bodies and similar references to ethnic Macedonians in neighbouring countries, are considered to be further
indications of continual yearnings for a super-Macedonian state.<sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup> Greece, like its rival, has objected to proposals for the use of various compound names. The names <i>Northern Macedonia</i>, <i>New Macedonia</i> and <i>Vardar Macedonia</i> all tend to imply recognition of a greater
Macedonia and have fuelled Greek concerns over further irredentist claims.
<p>
While it is thus prudent to keep in mind that Greece's objections to the name <i>Macedonia</i> must be seen in the context of a Balkan region which has historically experienced its own share of armed strife and territorial ambitions, considerations of whether the existence of a name, symbol, or vaguely-worded constitutional provision might be rightfully deemed threats to another state's territorial integrity are beyond the scope of this paper.<sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup> In fact, as I will allude to shortly, one wonders whether these considerations can ever be dealt with jurisprudentially given the political and historical speculation that is involved. To be sure, relevant <i>legal</i> frameworks do exist. Article 2(4) of the <cite>UN Charter</cite> and the <cite>Declaration on Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States</cite> formally outlaw the use of force against other states,
and the UN General Assembly's <cite>Definition of Aggression</cite> attempts to provide guidelines for the identification of prohibited activities.<sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup> However, Article 39 of the <cite>UN Charter</cite> and international practice has left final determination of the existence of any act of
aggression or threat to peace to the discretion of the Security Council. The question of whether Greece's territorial concerns are well-founded is thus perhaps destined to remain within the realm of <i>political</i> discourse.<sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup>
<p>
The second objection of Greece, and that which is central to this paper, is the concern that the FYROM has appropriated Greece's history and culture through the use of the name <i>Macedonia</i> and the Vergina Sun symbol. It is a concern less tangible internationally than that of territorial integrity and has consequently garnered less serious consideration. Greece contends that the modern FYROM has no historical claim on either the name
<i>Macedonia</i> or the Vergina Sun symbol. Arguing that modern Macedonians are little more than an ethnic mish-mash of Albanians, Bulgarians and whatever other power has made incursions into the region, Greece considers Macedonia to be an artificially created state, and Macedonian identity to be a fiction created by propaganda and anti-Greek sentiment. Moreover, domestically Greece denies the existence of a Macedonian ethnic minority in its northern province, recognizing at best the presence of small scattered groups of Slavophone Greeks in the region.<sup><a href="#seventeen">17</a></sup> The use of what is thought to be a historically Greek
name and symbol by an &quot;illegitimate&quot; group strikes at the heart of Greek cultural pride. Alternatively, even if the Slavs have been present in Macedonia since the 7th century A.D., as is claimed, the Greeks argue that the modern Macedonians can make no similar claim on names and symbols which flourished centuries before Christ.
<p>
<h3>Appeals to History</h3>

It is not so surprising that much of the popular, if not diplomatic, dialogue in the past years' debate has centered around competing interpretations of history---or to put it another way, the mutual assertions of national myths. In the absence of a clear legal framework, recourse must be made to persuasive moral or historical argument to sway political positions. I do not intend to engage in any evaluation of the merits of either party's claims, however.
While recognizing that legal discourse and evaluation is generally a backward-looking process, I admit to being rather suspicious of historical evidence as it relates to culture or peoples' rights. In such situations, what people <i>perceive</i> their history to be may well be more important---and certainly more easily discerned---than
any attempt to establish actual historical facts or <i>was eigentlich gewesen ist</i>.<sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup>
<p> 
Of the two countries, it seems Greece is more reliant on arguments for the accuracy of the historical record. In attempting to establish exclusive control over cultural forms, Greece forces itself to prove historical continuity and significant historical links to the cultural symbols. Macedonians, on the other hand, need only to give current expression to their own story or identity. In the absence of legal regimes, these considerations alone may well
give Macedonia the edge it needs to rebuff Greek assertions. Although it is not necessary to solve the grand question of the relationship of history to that of cultural identity at this time, attention ought to be paid to how legal regimes use and understand history when faced with peoples' claims to cultural rights.
<p>
<h3>International Law and Peoples' Rights to Culture</h3>

Evidently, moral and historical claims to rights relating to culture are deserving of international attention. The following questions, however, remain: To what extent is international law able to accommodate these claims and restate them in such a way as to allow any enforcement mechanisms to be effective?  To what extent does international law provide protection for a people wishing to call themselves <i>Macedonians</i>?  Or conversely, to what extent does international law protect Greeks from the unwarranted appropriation of their culture?
<p>
Little has been written on rights relating to culture in international law. There is general confusion not only as to the
scope of so-called cultural rights but as to the definition of culture itself. For the purposes of this comment, peoples' rights to culture may be thought of in two ways: first, rights relating to the expression of identity and, second, rights relating to the preservation and protection of heritage or property.<sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a></sup> Macedonia's claims will be considered as claims to rights in cultural expression while Greece's position will be dealt with under the model of heritage protection rights. This paper's primary concern is the question of how cultural
intangibles, like names, stories and symbols, might relate to legal regimes within these categories.
<p>
<i>Cultural Identity:  Macedonia</i>
<p>
When considering the FYROM's ability to name itself <i>Macedonia</i>, one finds oneself questioning that which has always been assumed---the right of a nation to call itself what it wants. Traditionally, states, as honourary individuals on the international stage, have benefitted from what seems to be a generally understood right to freedom of expression. This ability for a state to do and say what it desires comes not as an expansion of much newer human rights law, but rather from basic notions of state sovereignty and the equality of states. States' abilities to express or act seem limited only by newer, and as yet fairly narrow, principles such as the prohibition on the use of force across frontiers and on other acts which constitute violations of another's territorial integrity.<sup><a href="#twenty">20</a></sup> As noted above, I do not wish to deal at this point with the issue of whether the name <i>Macedonia</i> does in fact represent a threat or actual violation of Greece's territorial integrity. I am content, at the moment, to assume that this is not the case and hope to focus rather on whether, all things being equal, the FYROM may be legally justified in selecting the designation <i>Macedonia</i>. Moreover, any Macedonian
justification based on state sovereignty assumes that Macedonia is in fact a state. While membership in the UN and a gradual but significant increase in the number of states recognizing the new entity speaks to the likelihood of Macedonian statehood, in 1991 this was certainly less clear. In the absence of full statehood then, what legal justification do nations, such as what is now known as the FYROM, have in selecting a name such as <i>Macedonia</i>?  I propose to deal with this problem through discussions of self-determination, cultural rights law proper, and peoples' rights.
<p>
While by now the principle of self-determination is well enshrined in international law,<sup><a href="#twenty1">21</a></sup> it is by no means clear that the international law principle of self-determination inherently contains cultural privileges. Traditionally, self-determination has been considered a <i>political</i> right---a means to potential jurisdiction and control over a wider scope of affairs, rather than an end in itself. Often construed narrowly as applicable only to traditional decolonization, the right of self-determination has been deemed to give peoples the choice to become independent, to integrate into the colonial country in some way, shape or form, or to integrate similarly into another state.<sup><a href="#twenty2">22</a></sup>
 <p>
Many, however, do not consider the concept of self-determination frozen under the political/decolonization model. The International Covenants on <cite>Civil and Political Rights</cite> and <cite>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</cite> as well as the <cite>Declaration on Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States</cite> all explicitly refer to self-determination as a right available to &quot;all peoples.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty3">23</a></sup> It is clear that if self-determination is to be a relevant principle in this post-colonial era, it cannot be limited by exclusive reference to European colonial conquests of the past four centuries. Moreover,
these documents' reference to cultural development under the banner of self-determination gives rise to renewed questions as to the scope of the right. Similarly worded to the others, the <cite>International Covenant of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</cite> states the following:
<blockquote>
All peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.<sup><a href="#twenty4">24</a></sup>
</blockquote>
It seems that implicit at least within self-determination lies an acknowledgement that peoples, at the minimum, may freely pursue their own forms of culture and identity. Moreover, it would follow that it is for these peoples to determine the content of their culture or identity, including their collective name. Thus, for Macedonia, Judge Dillard's famous, albeit somewhat cryptic, words in <cite>Western Sahara</cite> might bring comfort:
<blockquote>
It is for the people to determine the destiny of the territory and not the territory the destiny of the people.<sup><a href="#twenty5">25</a></sup>
</blockquote>
As a corollary to this, one might propose that it is for a <i>people</i> to determine their <i>history</i> or collective
myths and not accepted historical <i>scholarship</i> the identity of the people. While admittedly an exclusive focus on contemporary perceptions and reality can lead to its own dangers,<sup><a href="#twenty6">26</a></sup>  outsiders' selective attempts to determine what is and what is not part of a people's &quot;authentic&quot; culture or national heritage once again highlight the difficulties of using &quot;objective&quot; historical &quot;evidence&quot; in the legal context. 
<p>
It is thus for the people themselves to express and shape their identity. In short, it is for the people to determine who they are. This cultural consciousness may then give rise to political consciousness, as a people seeks to create institutions which reflect its distinctive character. In nation to nation or &quot;external self-determination&quot; situations like that of the FYROM and Greece---where jurisdiction or territorial concessions are not involved---it is quite possible that the legal principle of self-determination would provide justification for the use of the name <i>Macedonia</i> as an expression of cultural and state identity.
<p>
Despite their enshrinement in an important international covenant,<sup><a href="#twenty7">27</a></sup> the scope of cultural rights proper suffers from an indeterminacy which makes their relevance to the <i>Macedonia</i> issue rather dubious. Creatures of human rights law, cultural rights as proclaimed in the <cite>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</cite> refers generally to the rights of individuals to take part in their own culture. Little attention has been paid to these individual rights beyond their bare assertion. The <cite>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</cite> expands on the notion of individual rights by making reference to minority groups within states, but it again centers on participation and association. Article 27 declares that
<blockquote>
In those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities exist, persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied the right, in community with the other members of their group, to enjoy their culture, to profess and practice their own religion, or to use their own language.<sup><a href="#twenty8">28</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Clearly, international human rights law's exclusive focus on the individual as the subject of its protection provides limited support to a group wishing to assert rights to a name or symbol.
<p>
Recent developments in international human rights law might, however, represent a new movement in the protection of group identity. The <cite>Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious or Linguistic Minorities</cite> adopted by the UN Commission on Human Rights in 1992 would require states to &quot;protect the existence and the national or ethnic, cultural, religious and linguistic identity of minorities within their respective territories, and . . . encourage conditions for the promotion of that identity.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty9">29</a></sup> While explicitly intended to deal with minority groups within state structures, the draft's applicability to the <i>Macedonia</i> issue lies in its recognition that cultural identity might be protected within the traditional human rights framework.
<p>
Far more relevant to the <i>Macedonia</i> question however is dialogue surrounding what has been termed the <i>third generation</i> of international human rights, namely &quot;collective rights,&quot; &quot;peoples' rights,&quot; or &quot;Community-Oriented Rights.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty">30</a></sup> Third generation rights seem both a recognition of existing rights' collective components or implications and an attempt to reformulate individual and minority rights into rights of peoples. Hence, the principle of self-determination discussed above has been considered a third generation human right, as might the right of minorities to cultural
identity proposed by the UN Commission on Human Rights.
<p>
What makes talk of third generation rights interesting in international law is both their capacity to give legal rights to entities previously not recognized as subjects of international law and the potential content of these rights. If &quot;all peoples&quot; now have the right to self-determination, might not minorities and other groups have a right to create and maintain their cultural identity? The potential use of collective rights paradigms is virtually
endless, although admittedly, discussions of cultural rights under this framework have remained on the fringes of legal discourse. Having said that, however, a proposal which would include a peoples' or a community's right to create and develop its own culture is hardly a radical concept. Its existence is almost intuitive; an explicit formulation does not seem far-fetched. The right of the people in the FYROM to declare themselves <i>Macedonian</i> in the 1991 national referendum seems under existing legal frameworks perhaps not so controversial.
<p>
<i>Cultural Protection:  Greece</i>
<p>
Having argued in favour of a group's ability to create and express a cultural identity, I now turn to the extent a group may protect this cultural expression internationally. Might Greece, whose people also consider the name <i>Macedonia</i> as well as the ancient Vergina Sun symbol to be part of their cultural identity, prevent others from using the same?
<p>
While Macedonia's claim to <i>use</i> seems almost intuitive, Greece's argument that others may <i>not use</i> the name and symbol is not yet known to international law. Considering the name <i>Macedonia</i> and the Vergina Sun symbol to be its own form of cultural intellectual property, Greece seeks to assert a type of copyright or trademark protection or, in the alternative, a personal or proprietary interest akin to various domestic formulations of <i>moral rights</i> law which protect an author's paternity and the integrity of a copyrightable work from mutilations or use by others.<sup><a href="#thirty1">31</a></sup> Greece's claims must then be evaluated through a consideration of what cultural property and international intellectual property rights currently exist in international law.
<p>
There is a significant body of international law dealing with cultural property.<sup><a href="#thirty2">32</a></sup> To date, however, this law has concerned itself exclusively with tangible cultural objects or artifacts and remains deaf to cultural intangibles such as names or symbols. A creature of discourse surrounding the laws of war, the <cite>Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict</cite><sup><a href="#thirty3">33</a></sup> of 1954 was the &quot;first universal convention to deal
solely with the protection of cultural property.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty4">34</a></sup> Convinced that damage to peoples' cultural property meant &quot;damage to the cultural heritage of all mankind, since each people makes its contribution to the culture of the world,&quot; the contracting parties pledged to impose sanctions on &quot;those persons, of whatever nationality, who commit or order to be committed a breach of the . . . Convention.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty5">35</a></sup> The UNESCO <cite>Convention on the Means
of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property</cite><sup><a href="#thirty6">36</a></sup> of 1970 represented a further development to cultural property law. Seeking to prevent &quot;illicit&quot; trade in cultural artifacts and objects, the parties agreed to oppose the &quot;impoverishment of the cultural heritage&quot; of a nation through illegal trade.<sup><a href="#thirty7">37</a></sup> Illegality was to be determined by individual source nations, while once again, the treaty by definition restricted its contemplation of cultural property to that of tangible objects.
<p>
Much has been made in the ensuing debate over the interplay between competing notions of <i>cultural universalism</i> and <i>cultural nationalism</i> in international cultural property law.<sup><a href="#thirty8">38</a></sup> In the spirit of the Common Heritage of Mankind [sic] &quot;principle&quot; in
international law, cultural universalism sees the protection of cultural property to be ultimately for the benefit of all humankind. Heralding international cultural awareness and interplay as a human good, cultural universalists are particularly impressed by the information that objects and artifacts may provide in regards to particular cultures. Preservation, a concern for authenticity or truth, and easy access are thus seen to be policy goals.<sup><a href="#thirty9">39</a></sup> As a consequence, cultural universalists tend to be somewhat less concerned over the actual <i>location</i> of cultural objects. Placement in a foreign museum which provides for greater preservation
and study of an object, for example, would thus be considered by cultural universalists as a more favourable alternative to a cultural artifact's domestic residence. Cultural nationalists, on the other hand, stress the ongoing importance and relationship of cultural objects to the identity and communal flourishing of peoples. These objects are thus best kept physically within their originating nations. Seeking to identify objects which might qualify as
&quot;property for grouphood&quot; and thus, it is proposed, be subject to a regime of &quot;absolute inalienability,&quot; cultural nationalists look to objects which are said to be sufficiently bound up with the collective personality of the people. Relevant factors would include the length of time of &quot;ownership,&quot; history, the object's contribution to notions of continuity and group pride, as well as the original artist, author, or sculptor's intended use for the object.<sup><a href="#forty">40</a></sup>
<p>
Neither position, however, affords much support to Greek concerns with respect to the use of <i>Macedonia</i> or the Vergina Sun. While cultural universalism considers copying a pollution of truth or authenticity of information, and its additional characteristic focus on the market value of tradeable objects implies the existence of potentially protectable cultural &quot;resources,&quot; its roots in Common Heritage of Mankind discourse is obviously quite
incompatible with Greek wishes to retain sole control over the alleged property. Moreover, cultural nationalism's push for inalienability rests to a large extent on the sanctity of communal objects which cannot be duplicated effectively or are not possessed in sufficient physical quantity. Neither approach lends itself well to the retention or protection of intangible property.
<p>
International intellectual property law, by contrast, has engaged the problem of cultural intangibles to at least a small degree. The <cite>Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property</cite> and its subsequent revisions<sup><a href="#forty1">41</a></sup> represents one of the major universal intellectual property agreements. Both Greece and Yugoslavia were considered parties to this convention at the start of the recent Balkan armed conflict. Under the terms of the agreement, nationals of Paris Union countries are entitled to the same intellectual property protection as domestic nationals in the respective party states. Article 6 of the <cite>Paris Convention</cite> deals with the registration of trademarks; Article 6ter lists prohibitions. Under Article 6ter, countries of the Union agree to invalidate applications for trademark registration which make unauthorized use of &quot;armorial bearings, flags, and other State emblems, of the countries of the Union.&quot; Parties to the Convention furthermore agree to communicate, through the International Bureau, &quot;the list of State emblems . . . which they desire . . . to place wholly or within certain limits under the protection of this Article . . . &quot; Domestic Greek legislation includes provisions prohibiting the use of &quot;emblems and insignia of the Hellenic State, Royal emblems, emblems of any authority, religious symbols or their names or devices . . . &quot;<sup><a href="#forty2">42</a></sup>
 <p>
Although international law thus recognizes the need for international protection of state and national symbols, its narrow application to the market context and its intent to curtail the activities of individuals rather than the state parties themselves, makes the trademark protection as it currently stands inadequate for Greece's purposes.
<p>
What then are the prospects for international intellectual property protection for cultural intangibles?  So far, little has been accomplished in this field. Traditional notions of originality and the single author/proprietor continue to permeate legal thought.<sup><a href="#forty3">43</a></sup> Moreover, establishing collective rights to traditional stories, artistic styles and the like flies in the face of pressures to expand the public domain to allow individual expression to flourish in the marketplace of ideas. The most vocal supporters of collective rights in intangibles have been aboriginal groups. These peoples seek to control what they consider to be both a blatant and systemic pirating of their symbols, images, ceremonies, designs, methods, stories, and art by non-aboriginal people in the commercial, literary and artistic realms.<sup><a href="#forty4">44</a></sup> Success has been limited.
Preliminary work as represented in a <cite>Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</cite> points to an attempt to declare internationally that indigenous peoples have &quot;the right to special measures to protect, as intellectual property . . . cultural manifestations, including . . . oral traditions, literatures, designs and visual and performing arts.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty5">45</a></sup> It is, however, unknown how such declarations will ultimately fare in the UN General Assembly.
<p>
It appears that Greece's attempt to control as intangible cultural property the use of the designation <i>Macedonia</i> and the Vergina Sun symbol currently has little legal foundation. Absent an agreement, it is difficult to see how a state's attempts to enforce extra-territorial jurisdiction over other states' or peoples' use of
national symbols is legally possible. A final question remains: Is it desirable?
<p>
<h3>An Evaluation</h3>

As mentioned above, from a strictly historical point of view, attempting to objectively determine cultural identity or
integral cultural symbols is a questionable enterprise at best. History, the pundits tell us, is all too often written by winners. The relevance of history in the determination of third generation rights moreover remains a matter of debate, particularly with respect to self-determination. Whether such principles are to be seen as remedies for past injustices or expressions of the needs of current and future populations is a matter which requires more  consideration. As a result, a project intending to afford nation states with abilities to control the use of their cultural intangibles seems doomed to fail by way of definitional uncertainty.
<p>
The project seems equally difficult when looked at from an anthropological point of view. Scholars question whether concepts of possession (and perhaps even of identity) are appropriate in the cultural context. Nations and cultures, they say, &quot;are not bounded, continuous over time, or internally homogeneous.&quot; Cultures and
groups are, rather, &quot;continually reconstructed, realigned, and reimagined.&quot;  To argue that cultural property bears witness to a present group, &quot;is to take a present-day understanding of one's collective identity and to naturalize it as if it were an objectively and continuously existent thing.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty6">46</a></sup> As Richard Handler maintains:
<blockquote>
[T]he culture that present-day groups claim as belonging to them from time immemorial, embodied in historically particular pieces of cultural property, is likewise the product of a current interpretation and not an objective thing that has possessed a continuous meaning and identity over time.<sup><a href="#forty7">47</a></sup>
</blockquote>
One does not wish to engage in a debate over whether, in this particular case, the name and symbol in question might be considered representative of a sufficiently static Greek or Macedonian culture. The anthropological critique suggests rather that, as a general policy, international legal protection of cultural intangibles may well be an illegitimate enterprise.
<p>
Finally, the nature of international law itself provides an impediment to such a regime. With binding dispute resolution between states remaining in most cases a consensual operation, it is difficult to see how historical and political claims of this nature could be effectively enforced. While the current <i>status quo</i> with regards to Macedonia appears an all-too-arbitrary exercise in power politics, it is as yet uncertain whether, in this case at
least, a reasonable compromise cannot be achieved. Where a resort to the Rule of Law may be most desired is in similar situations where diplomatic dialogue suffers from such a power imbalance as to be completely ineffectual.
<p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

The conflict between Greece and Macedonia remains an unfortunate international dispute in a region that needs no further cause for unrest. The realities of politics and power have left it a debate characterized by recourse to the legends of days gone  by---a battle of the historians. The brief attempt above at a legal analysis of the situation lends support to a prediction that the Greek-Macedonian conflict will remain a political war of attrition, with a workable interim compromise perhaps struck in the meantime on issues relating to the constitution and acceptable compound names. While Macedonia's position intuitively seems legally sound, Greece's desire to claim a proprietary-type interest in the name as well as in the Vergina Sun symbol seems beyond the scope of current
international law and contrary to workable international policy. It is unlikely that Greece would be willing to allow a legal determination of the case's merits in the absence of a declaration by the UN Security Council that non-Greek use of the name Macedonia amounts to a threat to international peace and security.
<p>
Nevertheless, it is hoped that the debate will serve to promote constructive discussion of the content and scope of rights relating to culture in international law. Attempts to clarify what is meant by &quot;peoples' rights&quot; and by &quot;peoples' rights to culture&quot; are certainly welcome in an area of law which suffers from a serious lack of attention.

<h3>Didi Herman, <cite>Rights of Passage: Struggles for Lesbian &amp; Gay Legal Equality.</cite>  Toronto: University of Toronto Press; 1994. 198 pp. $60.00 cloth. $19.95 paper.</h3>

In the past decade, activists within the lesbian and gay rights movement have turned increasingly to the courts and
legislatures to seek protection and affirmation of their existence. Human rights codes have been used to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination, and where sexual orientation is not included as a prohibited ground of discrimination, these codes have been challenged using the equality provision in s. 15 of the <cite>Charter of Rights
and Freedoms</cite>.<sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup> While individual cases and issues have attracted the attention of legal scholars,<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup> no one has explored the construction of  &quot;rights&quot; to the extent that Didi Herman does in <cite>Rights of Passage: Struggles for Lesbian &amp; Gay Legal Equality</cite>.<sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup> In this work, Herman further develops some of the themes she introduced in an earlier article, &quot;Are We Family?: Lesbian Rights and Women's Liberation&quot;.<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup> These include the social construction of the family, the relative efficacy of rights-based litigation, and the characterization of sexual orientation in human rights jurisprudence.
<p>
Herman is concerned about how rights are constructed in human rights legislation, and the extent to which the law is open to receiving new constructions. She is also interested in comparing the tactics of what she terms the &quot;New Christian Right&quot; (NCR) with the struggles waged by lesbian and gay legal reformers. As a lawyer and sociologist, Herman investigates a number of different aspects of the lesbian and gay rights movement,  including the use of feminist ideology, expert testimony in courts, and the reactions of legislators and jurists to the rights movement. In her research, Herman incorporates extensive interviews, case studies, and personal anecdotes which are influenced by her own &quot;Jewish, lesbian, socialist feminist&quot;<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup> perspective. This holistic approach breathes life into a number of abstract concepts and issues, so that even to one not familiar with the surrounding academic debate, <cite>Rights of Passage</cite> offers a meaningful insight into the legal process. It is extremely well researched and provides a well-written analysis of
some of the main issues in the current lesbian and gay rights movement.
<p>
Herman begins her work by situating lesbian and gay identity in current political and legal discourse. She traces the history of the use of human rights legislation and litigation under the <cite>Charter</cite> to advocate legal recognition of sexual orientation as a ground of discrimination. She argues that the paradigm of legal liberalism has strongly influenced the way that lesbian and gay rights reformers structure their claims. 
<p>
Human rights legislation is founded on a liberal ideology which emphasizes the equality of individuals.<sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup> The principle of equality is premised on the idea that within the population, some minority groups suffer from discrimination. In order for these discrete minorities<sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup> to fully participate in society, the state is required to act as a &quot;neutral protector&quot;<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup> by enforcing public rights documents.<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup> Gays and lesbians have been able to use this model successfully by positioning themselves as a minority group in a majority heterosexual population. With this approach, litigants have been able to show that human rights legislation is underinclusive where it does not include protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.<sup><a href="#ten">10</a></sup>
<p>
As Herman points out, however, there are difficulties with the traditional liberal approach, as embodied in the <cite>Charter</cite> and human rights codes. When applied to sexual orientation, this view implicitly reinforces heterosexuality as the unquestioned norm, while gays and lesbians find themselves characterized as a homogeneous group with immutable sexual characteristics over which they have little or no control.<sup><a href="#eleven">11</a></sup> Gays and lesbians are relegated to the status of sexual minority and there is no acknowledgement of alternative theories, such as the existence of a spectrum of human sexualities. This approach further marginalizes others, including bisexuals, transsexuals and the transgendered, who may not fit into the traditional liberal categories.
<p>
Ultimately, Herman hopes to see a wholesale change in the way courts view sexual relations between individuals. The use of a traditional minority/majority analysis serves to entrench the notion of heterosexuality as a norm against which sexual minorities are measured. As a result, individuals who differ from the norm find themselves classified into groups; their efforts at making connections with other disadvantaged groups are impeded, and they find that the effectiveness of remedies under human rights legislation is consequently reduced.<sup><a href="#twelve">12</a></sup> Feminists like Herman critique the social construction of gender roles and the imposition of sexual hierarchies in society.<sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup> Herman suggests that, in order to oppose this liberal framework, lesbians and gays could make rights claims on the basis of their political position, rather than their sexual difference.<sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup> Throughout her book, Herman considers the benefits of, and the constraints inherent in, challenging the heterosexual norm. In the short term, however, she
acknowledges the importance of the political achievements that have come from characterizing lesbians and gays as an immutable minority. For example, she cites greater visibility in the media, greater political awareness, and increasing societal acceptance of lesbians and gays as important achievements in the struggle for equality.<sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup> An additional advantage is the raising of social consciousness and solidarity among lesbians and gays around the idea of a political movement.<sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup>
<p>
<cite>Rights of Passage</cite> uses the campaign over Bill 7<sup><a href="#seventeen">17</a></sup> in Ontario as a case study through which to examine the construction of rights by all sides in the debate. This legislation added &quot;sexual orientation&quot; as a prohibited ground of discrimination in the Ontario <cite>Human Rights Code</cite><sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup> in 1986. The author argues that
&quot;in this specific struggle, a liberal equality paradigm was hegemonic.&quot;<sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a></sup> She traces the use of rights in the debate by examining the statements of legislators, the media, gay and lesbian activists, and their opponents from right-wing Christian groups. In this way, she discovers how the concept of rights can be used to serve the purpose of the group that uses it.
<p>
Legislators who advocated amending the <cite>Code</cite> to include sexual orientation tended to appeal to the public's sense of tolerance and the principle of pluralism.<sup><a href="#twenty">20</a></sup> At the same time, there was an implicit recognition that the proposed changes would have relatively minor effects.<sup><a href="#twenty1">21</a></sup> Gay and lesbian political activists generally bought into the liberal rights paradigm, even though many of them were well aware of the limited impact that the addition of sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination would have. For them, it was most important to use Bill 7 as a step in the
process toward achieving equality, even though the amendment to the <cite>Human Rights Code</cite> would not result in equality or liberation in itself.<sup><a href="#twenty2">22</a></sup>
<p>
While a sufficient social consensus developed to see the bill passed, Herman is very concerned with the implications of the fact that liberal legal concepts so effectively dominated the debate. There was little discussion of the inherent limitations of using the Ontario Human Rights Commission as a vehicle for social change.<sup><a href="#twenty3">23</a></sup> Also, those who spoke out in favour of Bill 7 tended to base their positions on a very narrow spectrum of analysis. Evelyn Gigantes, the M.P.P. responsible for the amendment, is cited as being unique
in injecting a feminist perspective into the discussion. Herman identifies her as the only person in the Ontario legislature to speak about heterosexism as a source of homophobia.<sup><a href="#twenty4">24</a></sup>
<p>
Herman next examines the politics of the New Christian Right and their response to the progress made by lesbian and gay rights reformers. By &quot;New Christian Right,&quot; Herman means a loose assortment of organizations which adhere to a conservative, evangelical type of Christianity.<sup><a href="#twenty5">25</a></sup>  In particular she focuses on the work of the Salvation Army, Focus on the Family (Canada), and REAL Women. She chose these organizations because they formed part of the coalition which intervened in the case of <cite>Mossop</cite>.<sup><a href="#twenty6">26</a></sup> By making
references to some of their published literature and to interviews with some of their members, Herman examines their construction of sexual politics.
<p>
In general, these groups perceive the <cite>Charter</cite> as entrenching the concept of liberal equality in society, as a result of which gay rights have gained a certain institutional legitimacy.<sup><a href="#twenty7">27</a></sup> They sense a clear bias in the media and the judiciary against their view of traditional Christian morality and in favour of a secular humanist approach.<sup><a href="#twenty8">28</a></sup> NCR organizations therefore feel forced to put forward their own Christian-based message in <cite>Charter</cite> litigation by taking a stance against the prevailing liberal views.<sup><a href="#twenty9">29</a></sup> In fact, Herman writes that the group REAL Women &quot;views the <cite>Charter</cite> as an unqualified evil which they argue about only because they have to: `instead, we say, get rid of the <cite>Charter</cite>.'&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty">30</a></sup>
<p>
Other NCR organizations criticize &quot;rights-oriented&quot; litigation because it places too much emphasis on the individual, while losing sight of the privileges and the responsibilities of members of society.<sup><a href="#thirty1">31</a></sup> They advocate less focus on the individual and more on the family. The &quot;family&quot; is presented as a centre of good Christian life, which is being explicitly threatened as more individual rights are conferred on gays and lesbians outside of the family setting.<sup><a href="#thirty2">32</a></sup> For all of these reasons, these groups are somewhat reluctant to use rights rhetoric to express their positions on <cite>Charter</cite> issues. At the same time, however, Herman suggests that rights
could be used by the NCR as a way of advocating their position based on the principle that the views of religious minorities must be protected.<sup><a href="#thirty3">33</a></sup>
<p>
Herman's dissection of the Bill 7 episode provides an instructive analysis for rights activists. It demonstrates how the heat of a political campaign can force groups to quickly line up on either side of a particular issue. This process does not easily allow for the presentation of novel or refined arguments, and it can lead to the concept of  &quot;rights&quot; taking on a different meaning according to how it is used in political discourse. Even the
parties most affected by the issues may find that they lose control over the nature and direction of the debate.
<p>
The second major case study in <cite>Rights of Passage</cite> uses the <cite>Mossop</cite> case as its focus. This case began as a challenge by Brian Mossop against his employer, the federal government, for refusing his request for a day of leave to attend the funeral of his partner's father. His partner did not fall under the category of
&quot;immediate family&quot; covered by the bereavement leave provision of his union's collective agreement. As the <cite>Canadian Human Rights Act</cite><sup><a href="#thirty4">34</a></sup> does not include sexual orientation as an enumerated ground of discrimination, Mossop tried to challenge it by attacking the definition of &quot;family.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty5">35</a></sup>
<p>
A coalition of conservative Christian groups intervened in order to present their view of what constituted a family. They attempted to explain why it was so important for the court to uphold the traditional view, and they expressed concern that the federal Attorney General's Office was not making a sufficient effort to present an alternative to Mossop's functional approach to the meaning of family.<sup><a href="#thirty6">36</a></sup>
<p>
Herman uses the <cite>Mossop</cite> case as a means by which to analyze how the politics of the New Christian Right have been affected by the process of <cite>Charter</cite> litigation. As the NCR organizations have adopted the language of equality rights, their Christian focus has been co-opted or ousted by the legalism of their lawyers, or alternatively, they are deliberately cloaking their true politics with respectable language. Herman sees this same process occurring when feminist organizations formulate their position on an issue. She notes that when feminist groups draft legal submissions, they do not necessarily reveal the radical politics of the lesbian feminists who are involved in the writing process.<sup><a href="#thirty7">37</a><sup>  This comparison of two very different social movements illustrates the power that <cite>Charter</cite> -oriented arguments can exert on all types of political strategies.<sup><a href="#thirty8">38</a></sup>
<p>
In the course of her interviews with key members of the NCR organizations involved in the <cite>Mossop</cite> litigation, the author finds a real sense of marginalization. In one case, one of the subjects even compares her feelings as a Christian to those of closeted lesbians and gay men who suffer from the same kinds of  persecution.<sup><a href  = "#thirty9">39</a></sup>  Herman is able to conclude that &quot;the NCR and its opponents . . . share similar yet irreconcilable views of their social worlds. Each believes the other (or some `other') controls society's major institutions. They share a fear and distrust of the other . . . .&quot;<sup><a href="#forty">40</a></sup>
<p>
This insight is fascinating, for it illustrates a rare link between groups entrenched on opposite sides of the liberal &quot;centre&quot; occupied by the courts. In presenting this view, the author balances her feelings of empathy with a deep distrust. As she cautions in the first chapter of <cite>Rights of Passage</cite>:
<blockquote>
The interviews I conducted provided me with a very different &quot;take&quot; on a group of people I would previously have dismissed as religious fanatics. I could not escape the fact that they were nice <i>towards me</i>, that they did their utmost to assist my research, and that they rather poignantly expressed gratitude that &quot;at least someone is interested in what we have to say. . . .&quot; At the same time, I knew that the interviewees were utterly opposed to everything I believed in.<sup><a href="#forty1">41</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Herman acknowledges her own perspective at the same time that she identifies some common ground with the NCR leaders. She successfully gains insight into her political opponents while maintaining the integrity of her position. 
<p>
One of the unfortunate aspects of <cite>Rights of Passage</cite> is the fact that it has come out during a period of great transition in the lesbian and gay rights movement. As such, it fails to address some of the important emerging issues in the movement.
<p>
Attention has recently turned away from the campaign to recognize sexual orientation in human rights legislation, as the limitations of this approach are becoming apparent. The goal of achieving protection from discrimination in public spheres is no longer viewed as one that will provide true equality. Instead, lesbians and gays tend to be seeking greater acknowledgement and acceptance of their existence by major societal institutions.<sup><a href="#forty2">42</a></sup> In continuing the litigation process where <cite>Mossop</cite> left off, lesbian and gay couples are coming to court in increasing numbers to demand spousal benefits. Among the most famous cases is
<cite>Egan</cite>,<sup><a href="#forty3">43</a></sup> which involves a challenge to the <cite>Old Age Security Act</cite><sup><a href="#forty4">44</a></sup> under s. 15 of the <cite>Charter</cite> on the grounds that it discriminates against same-sex spouses. The case was argued before the Supreme Court in the fall of 1994. By challenging the definition of &quot;spouse,&quot; the <cite>Egan</cite> case raises the stakes in the struggle for equality by lesbians and gays. While earlier efforts sought to extend the application of human rights legislation to lesbian and gay individuals, the <cite>Egan</cite> case strikes more closely at the very definition of a family. A broader interpretation of the word &quot;spouse&quot; would help to validate lesbian and gay relationships in the minds of the public and it would further chip away at the traditional concept of family that the NCR has fought hard to uphold.<sup><a href="#forty5">45</a></sup>
<p>
The summer of 1994 saw a political debate in Ontario which had striking similarities to the fight for Bill 7. Bill 167<sup><a href="#forty6">46</a></sup> would have recognized same-sex couples as spouses under provincial legislation.<sup><a href="#forty7">47</a></sup> It was fought over by a large, organized segment of the gay and lesbian community, and strongly opposed by religious groups---particularly the Catholic Church.<sup><a href="#forty8">48</a></sup> In contrast to the debate in 1986, this time the proposal was defeated in the Ontario legislature. Herman's depiction of the fight for Bill 7 is still instructive despite the failure of Bill 167, however, for the way it sets up a comparison of the rights debate and the positions of the parties involved. By tracing the development of the use of rights-based litigation from the time it was deployed over Bill 7, it is possible to see what the future holds for the use of the <cite>Charter</cite> by gays and lesbians to advance their rights.
<p>
The most compelling message to be derived from <cite>Rights of Passage</cite> is that gay and lesbian activists need to develop new political strategies that try to expand the traditional notions of the family and of sexual relations. There is a limit to the benefit of tailoring human rights-based notions of equality to include sexual minorities. As Herman says, &quot;the undermining of heterosexuality, and eventually the deconstruction of gender itself, is a necessary part of any larger project of social transformation.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty9">49</a></sup>  Herman recognizes that in the short run, radical arguments about the construction of sexuality in society may not be accepted. However, she identifies the importance of putting such ideas before
the judiciary so that future litigators can argue for a better conception of social relations. While the <cite>Mossop</cite> case was not decided in favour of gays and lesbians, the use of novel legal arguments has met with success elsewhere. For example, in <cite>R. v. Butler</cite><sup><a href="#fifty">50</a></sup>, the Supreme Court formulated a test for obscenity which adopted a feminist analysis of pornography, based on the harm it causes to women.<sup><a href="#fifty1">51</a></sup>
<p>
By analyzing campaigns and strategies from the past, Herman presents a valuable insight to those litigating cases under the <cite>Charter</cite>. Thus, while the book is structured around two specific political and legal campaigns in Canada, by holding a mirror to the gay and lesbian rights movement Herman's work provides the basis for understanding how rights are constructed in these contests. For those engaging in political campaigns and <cite>Charter</cite> litigation, it can most usefully serve as a caution about how the meaning of rights is constructed. For all of these reasons, <cite>Rights of Passage</cite> is a welcome addition to a growing literature on the subject of lesbian and gay legal issues. As Herman notes in her conclusion, however, there are many connections between the lesbian and gay rights movement and the struggles of other equality-seeking groups.
Ultimately, <cite>Rights of Passage</cite> tries to demonstrate how organizations seeking social change have an interest in formulating joint strategies. With her thoughtful analysis of rights issues, Herman presents a strong argument for the use of a co-ordinated effort in struggles yet to come.

In its groundbreaking decision of <cite>R. v. Sparrow</cite>, the Supreme Court of Canada explored for the first time the scope and strength of s. 35(1) of the <cite>Charter</cite> as &quot;a promise to the Aboriginal peoples of Canada.&quot;  In the course of examining s. 35(1)'s theoretical and political context, the Court set
out a framework by which to consider both the nature and content of Aboriginal rights, and their constitutional limitations.  In June of 1993, the British Columbia Court of Appeal rendered judgment on a series of cases, including <cite>Delgamuukw v.  British Columbia</cite>, in which the strength of  <cite>Sparrow</cite>'s promise to invigorate and secure constitutional Aboriginal rights was tested. The author argues that by allowing controversy over commercial fishing rights, as well as stereotyped conceptions of Aboriginal culture, to govern its decision-making process, the majority of the Court failed to uphold that promise.

<p>
When the Supreme Court of Canada decided <cite>R. v. Sparrow</cite>, <sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup> it resolved a great many outstanding issues concerning the nature of Aboriginal rights. Expressing itself in broad, affirmative terms, the Court indicated that the idea that Aboriginal rights were only `politically enforceable' and legally meaningless was no longer acceptable, and that the Court's intention was to ensure that the constitutional law of Canada take Aboriginal rights seriously. <sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup> Not only did the Court synthesize existing judicial views on the meaning of s. 35(1) of the <cite>Constitution Act</cite><sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup> in a way that sought to give meaningful content to the constitutional `recognition and affirmation' of these rights, it also attempted to set out a framework by which to reconcile the seemingly intractable competing interests affected by the recognition of Aboriginal rights. Given the difficulty of such an ambitious project, it is not surprising that we should find some loose ends left hanging from the Court's conception of Aboriginal rights. What might surprise us more would be to find the retrenchment of views rejected by the Supreme Court about the nature of Aboriginal rights and their meaning in our legal system.
<p>
It is the loose ends of  <cite>Sparrow</cite>'s judicial fabric that I intend to explore in this article.<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup> In particular, I will focus on the interpretation of  <cite>Sparrow</cite> in the British Columbia Court of Appeal's recent decisions on Aboriginal fishing rights: <cite>R. v. Van der Peet</cite>,<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup> <cite>R. v. Gladstone</cite><sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup> and <cite>R. v. Nikal</cite>.<sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup> These cases, and the more prominent <cite>Delgamuukw v. The Queen</cite>,<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup>  will most likely represent the Supreme Court of Canada's first opportunity to restate and clarify its decision in <cite>Sparrow</cite>.<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup>  It is therefore highly relevant to examine them closely for their treatment of that case, as well as of Aboriginal rights in general.
<p>
In order to evaluate these cases, I propose first to briefly outline the context in which <cite>Sparrow</cite> was decided and the aspects of the decision which I consider to be the most important for present purposes, and to describe the `loose ends' which the case leaves outstanding. Although <cite>Sparrow</cite> has been discussed many times before in academic contexts, the British Columbia Court of Appeal decisions offer us an opportunity to re-visit this important decision with the knowledge of the way in which it has been interpreted by a later high court. In this way, we can see <cite>Sparrow</cite>'s sometimes vague pronouncements about Aboriginal rights in a new light. It is the thesis of this paper that the British Columbia Court of Appeal majority chose to rely on old-fashioned, narrow, `safe' visions of Aboriginal rights instead of taking up the challenge of giving real meaning to the open-ended phrases of <cite>Sparrow</cite>, even as it invoked these very phrases.
<p>
I will divide my analysis of <cite>Sparrow</cite> along the same lines as did the Court. The first section will explore the nature and content of Aboriginal rights. The second section will examine the Court's analysis of what constitutes a violation of these rights, and how such violations may be justified. Following this revisitation of
<cite>Sparrow</cite>, I will move to a discussion of the British Columbia Court of Appeal decisions in a parallel structure. First, <cite>Van der Peet</cite> and <cite>Gladstone</cite> offer an opportunity to examine the British Columbia Court of Appeal's vision of Aboriginal rights themselves. Second, <cite>Nikal</cite> and <cite>Gladstone</cite> set out the majority's view of violation and justification. Intertwined throughout will be references to other cases that deal with Aboriginal rights, such as <cite>R. v. Agawa</cite><sup><a href="#ten">10</a></sup>  and <cite>Four B Manufacturing v. United Garment Workers of America</cite>,<sup><a href = #eleven">11</a></sup>  in order to show the genesis and context of the Supreme Court's thinking on these rights. Finally, I will set out Lambert J.A.'s consistently dissenting vision of Aboriginal rights in order to show that there is an alternative to the majority's viewpoint. While this alternative may not be the best answer, it is far superior than the majority approach, because in setting out his own vision, Lambert J.A. at least makes a real effort to adopt the vision of the Aboriginal rights-holders themselves. And since this very perspective is one of the strongest directions offered in <cite>Sparrow</cite>, this brief introduction brings us back to where I would like to begin.
<p>
<center><h3>Part One: <cite>Sparrow</cite></h3></center>

Ronald Sparrow was charged with fishing with an over-long drift net contrary to the <cite>British Columbia Fishery (General) Regulations</cite>.<sup><a href="#twelve">12</a></sup> In concluding that the regulations did infringe s. 35, the Court addressed two main issues: first, the nature of Aboriginal rights and the appropriate interpretive principles to apply to them, and second, whether Aboriginal rights are absolute within the Canadian constitutional framework, or are limited according to certain principles. 
<p>
<b>1. Aboriginal Rights and Section 35(1)</b>
<p>
As the Court had done in its early <cite>Charter</cite><sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup> decisions, Dickson C.J.C. and La Forest J. write in broad and purposive terms about the meaning and importance of constitutionally protected rights. They cast their discussion against the backdrop of the law's failure to recognize Aboriginal claims to land and, indeed, the law's general failure to acknowledge or uphold Aboriginal peoples' rights within Canada at all.<sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup> The Justices conclude that s. 35(1) is the &quot;culmination of a long and difficult struggle in both the political forum and the courts for the constitutional recognition of aboriginal rights.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup> Where, in the early <cite>Charter</cite> cases, the Court spoke eloquently about the nature of the rights protected by the <cite>Charter</cite>, the Court in <cite>Sparrow</cite> was not similarly able to comment on the rights protected by s. 35(1). Section 35(1) protects undefined Aboriginal rights, while the <cite>Charter</cite> enumerates broad, but specific, rights and freedoms. It is impossible, and inappropriate, to try to describe the substance of `Aboriginal rights' in any general way. 
<p>
As a result, instead of commenting at length on the content of the right asserted by Mr. Sparrow, the Court sets out some broad considerations that a court should take into account when contemplating Aboriginal rights. From a substantive point of view, the Justices observe that in the context of Musqueam life, &quot;the salmon fishery has always constituted an integral part of their distinctive culture,&quot;<sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup> giving future
courts some idea of the significance to Aboriginal culture that a particular practice or activity should have in order to warrant constitutional protection under s. 35(1). The Court also gives some guidance in selecting the appropriate interpretive principles. It emphasizes, for example, that courts must avoid defining the content of Aboriginal rights by sole reference to legal concepts that do not flow from Aboriginal culture. The Court notes that: 
<blockquote>
[f]ishing rights are not traditional property rights. They are rights held by a collective and are in keeping with the culture and existence of that group. Courts must be careful, then, to avoid the application of traditional common law concepts of property as they develop their understanding of ... the &quot;<cite>sui generis</cite>&quot; nature of aboriginal rights.<sup><a href="#seventeen">17</a></sup>
 </blockquote>
The Court goes on to say that &quot;[w]hile it is impossible to give an easy definition of fishing rights, it is possible, and, indeed, crucial, to be sensitive to the aboriginal perspective on the meaning of the rights at stake.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup> In my view, this approach to perspective and to the substance of Aboriginal rights is appropriate in order to ensure that these rights are not lost in the legal shuffle, as they had been &quot;for many years.&quot;<sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a></sup> These are, of course, not the only possible tools for the constitutional treatment of Aboriginal rights. For the purposes of this article, however, I will be referring to them frequently since they are the principles which the British Columbia Court of Appeal took to be definitive.<sup><a href="#twenty">20</a></sup>
<p>
FROZEN RIGHTS
<p>
In contemplating the purpose and implications of s. 35(1), the Court rejected the suggestion that s. 35(1) only  protects Aboriginal rights as they existed in regulated form in 1982.<sup><a href="#twentyone">21</a></sup> Having proposed that the Aboriginal perspective on the right is crucial, it seems doubtful that the Court could have accepted the notion of `frozen rights.'  Adopting this theory would mean assuming that Aboriginal rights may be defined by reference to federal and provincial regulations rather than by reference to the society and culture in which they are rooted. This approach is fundamentally inconsistent with the principle of adhering to the Aboriginal perspective when considering these rights. It would be odd to suggest that non-Aboriginal laws could determine what was &quot;integral to their distinctive culture.&quot;
<p>
The Court's explicit reason for rejecting the theory, however, is that it would make a mess of the Constitution. Following Blair J.A.'s view in <cite>Agawa</cite>, and Professor Slattery's comments on the subject,<sup><a href="#twentytwo">22</a></sup> the Court holds that &quot;the notion of freezing existing rights would incorporate into the Constitution a crazy patchwork of regulations,&quot;<sup><a href="#twentythree">23</a></sup> and that constitutional integrity demands a principled approach. The Court adds that &quot;far from being defined according to the regulatory scheme in place in 1982, the phrase `existing aboriginal rights' must be interpreted flexibly so as to permit their evolution over time.&quot;<sup><a href="#twentyfour">24</a></sup>
<p>
The Court's rejection of the frozen rights theory is a crucial aspect of  <cite>Sparrow</cite>, and illustrates the multi-layered nature of s. 35(1). The fallacy of frozen rights has the potential to operate both in interpreting s. 35(1) itself, through the word &quot;existing,&quot; and at the more fundamental level of where the content of the rights
themselves is determined. As a result, <cite>Sparrow</cite> imposes a further constraint on a court's powers of definition, and literally liberates the rights s. 35(1) protects. The rights are freed from being determined by reference to government action. The court is also prevented from relying solely on the content of an Aboriginal
right at a particular point in time. Although I have suggested that rejecting `frozen rights' is an inevitable consequence of adopting an Aboriginal perspective under s. 35(1), the British Columbia Court of Appeal's treatment in the cases discussed in this article reveals a resistance to the total liberation of the rights from the regulations.
<p>
In the cases I will be discussing, a key aspect of the rights asserted is that they are seen to be `different,' to varying degrees, from the practices exercised prior to the assertion of British sovereignty. The Court's view in <cite>Sparrow</cite> that Aboriginal rights are not restricted to some primaeval form is the starting point
for contemplating how different a `modern' Aboriginal right is from a `traditional' one or, indeed, whether it is different at all. Second, the rights asserted in these cases exist, as the Court notes in <cite>Sparrow</cite>, within a web of regulation so thick that it is difficult, at times, to determine what the right actually is. The difference between Aboriginal rights and <cite>Charter</cite> rights makes it easier to confuse Aboriginal rights with the regulations. It goes without saying, for example, that freedom of religion is guaranteed to every Canadian not because legislation grants it to us, but because of  &quot;the centrality of the rights associated with freedom of
individual conscience both to basic beliefs about human worth and dignity and to a free and democratic political system.&quot;<sup><a href="#twentyfive">25</a></sup> It may be more difficult for a court to understand the nature of a constitutionalized Aboriginal right to fish, existing outside the present regulatory scheme, when most Canadians exercise `rights' to fish only with the government's permission. Both the source and the scope of the rights protected under s. 35(1) have the potential to be obscured by regulation. <cite>Sparrow</cite>'s rejection of the concept of frozen rights, however, <i>requires</i> a court to extricate its perspective from the regulations, and to resist the
gravitational pull toward determining the content of an Aboriginal right by reference to the legislative scheme by which it is constrained. 
<p>
FISHING RIGHTS
<p>
In order to lay a foundation for discussion of the British Columbia Court of Appeal's decisions in <cite>Van der Peet</cite>, <cite>Gladstone</cite> and <cite>Nikal</cite>, which all concern fishing rights, it is worth examining the Court's description of British Columbia's fishing regime in <cite>Sparrow</cite>. The Court notes that the Province's fishery has become highly regulated and controlled, so much so that fishing is prohibited to everyone but licence holders.<sup><a href="#twentysix">26</a></sup> Before British Columbia entered Confederation, however, the fishery was not regulated  &quot;in any significant way.&quot;<sup><a href="#twentyseven">27</a></sup> At that time, the Court observes, &quot;[c]ommercial and sport fishing were not ... of any great importance.&quot;<sup><a href="#twentyeight">28</a></sup> Later regulations, beginning in 1878, imposed limits on fishing in general, and Indian fishing in particular. The 1878 regulations provided that Indians were free to catch fish as they wished, as long as they did not use drift nets or spears. These fish could not be offered for sale or barter. The Court remarks that the &quot;[t]he Indian right or liberty to fish was thereby restricted.&quot;<sup><a href="#twentynine">29</a></sup> It was
further restricted by its conversion from a `liberty,' to a permitted activity, and &quot;[u]ltimately, in 1917, the power to regulate even food fishing [was exercised] by means of conditions attached to the permit.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty">30</a></sup> The Court identifies the result of this progression as &quot;the Indian right to fish for food,&quot; pursuant to which &quot;an Indian could fish for food under a `special licence' specifying method, locale and times of fishing.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirtyone">31</a></sup> Needless to say, this 'right' had come a long
way from the original liberty. 
<p>
It is vital to recognize that the definition of this &quot;Indian right to fish for food&quot; evolved in lockstep with increased non-Indian participation in the fishery. The right provided for by the regulations was defined by reference to the needs of the non-Indian commercial and sport fishery, not by reference to Aboriginal societies and cultures. While the Court does eventually reject the argument that the rights were extinguished by the regulations, it is
not quite so clear that it succeeded in rejecting the role of the regulations in defining the rights. At the beginning of the Court's analysis, it notes that Indians were free to fish as they chose; at the end, the Court makes casual reference to the &quot;aboriginal right to fish for food purposes,&quot;<sup><a href="#thirtytwo">32</a></sup>and the &quot;aboriginal right to fish for food and social and ceremonial activities.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirtythree">33</a></sup> But where does this latter characterization of the Aboriginal right come from?  The phrase appears to have been coined by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in its decision in <cite>Sparrow</cite>. The Supreme Court  describes, and adopts, the Court of Appeal's conclusion that: 
<blockquote>
... the aboriginal right was to fish for food purposes, but that purpose was not to be confined to mere subsistence. Rather the right was found to extend to fish consumed for social and ceremonial activities. The Court of Appeal thereby defined the right as <i>protecting the same interest as is reflected in the government's food fish policy.</i> In limiting the right to food purposes, the Court of Appeal referred to the line of cases involving the interpretation of
the <i>Natural Resources Agreements and the food purpose limitation placed on the protection of fishing and hunting rights by the Constitution Act, 1930.</i><sup><a href="#thirtyfour">34</a></sup> [emphasis added.]
</blockquote>
Even though the Court says, just a few lines later, that &quot;historical policy on the part of the Crown is ... incapable of, in itself, delineating that right,&quot; and that &quot;[t]he nature of government regulations cannot be determinative of the content and scope of an existing aboriginal right,&quot;<sup><a href="#thirtyfive">35</a></sup> it is difficult to accept that the Court was not, in fact, highly influenced by the federal regulatory scheme in defining the Musqueam right to fish. The Court proposes, for example, to leave discussion of commercial aspects of the right to fish until another day, since the &quot;case at bar was not presented on the footing of an aboriginal right to fish for commercial or livelihood purposes.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirtysix">36</a></sup> In doing so, the Court concludes that there exists a Musqueam right to fish for food and for ceremonial and social purposes that exists separately from a Musqueam right to fish for sale or barter, and that these rights may be treated separately. This division closely patterns what the Musqueam are presently permitted and not permitted to do under the regulatory scheme. But is there any justification, flowing from <cite>Musqueam</cite> culture and society, for conceiving of separate rights to fish for food and for commercial purposes? Indeed, is there any reason for contemplating a `right to fish' rather than a `right to survive' or, for that matter, a `right to regulate fishing?'  In my view, the only justification the Court
presents is one that flows from the regulatory scheme. At the very least, the right the Court considers the Musqueam to have is too much a product of the Court's contemplation of the regulatory scheme for us to comfortably say that the Court did not fall into the very trap that it counselled future courts to avoid.
<p>
The fact that the Supreme Court could say, on the very same page, that Aboriginal rights must not be defined by reference to government policy, but then conclude that the Musqueam right is appropriately defined by government policy's conception of it, shows the difficulty of the task facing courts dealing with s. 35(1) claims. <cite>Sparrow</cite> presents courts with the challenge of attempting to put themselves in the place of the Aboriginal people asserting the right, and then determining, from this perspective, what is integral to an Aboriginal people's distinctive culture. The Supreme Court of Canada, while enunciating these principles, may not have managed to coherently apply them. In adjudicating s. 35(1), however, a court has the power to define both the legal rights of the Aboriginal people who assert them, and their history and culture. This is not a task to be taken lightly. Judges must break free of their own imagination of Aboriginal culture and the network of regulation resting upon and constraining Aboriginal rights, even if it is difficult. These requirements are the challenge of <cite>Sparrow</cite>. 
<p>
<b>2. Limitations Under s. 35(1)</b>
<p>
In addition to setting out an approach for describing the content of Aboriginal rights, the Supreme Court developed an analysis of limitations of these rights similar to the framework used under s. 1 of the <cite>Charter</cite>. The British Columbia Court of Appeal, in <cite>Sparrow</cite>, had opted for a weak justificatory standard:
&quot;s. 35(1) ... protects the aboriginal right only when exercised for food purposes and permits restrictive regulation of such rights whenever `reasonably justified as being necessary for the proper management and conservation of the resource or in the public interest.'&quot;<sup><a href="#thirtyseven">37</a></sup>The Court had
arrived at this conclusion after evaluating the various conceptions advanced regarding s. 35(1)'s effect, which ranged from the intervenors' argument that rights protected under s. 35(1) could not be limited at all, to the province's assertion that s. 35(1) did not offer any protection from governmental action because it merely
stated &quot;an assurance of good intentions.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirtyeight">38</a></sup> When the Supreme Court contemplated limitations, then, it had a variety of views from which to choose, and it is important to note that none of them, except the intervenors' argument, has much grounding in the text of s. 35(1) itself. The limitation that the Supreme Court eventually settled on has its source not in s. 35(1) but in the Court's conception of the Constitution as a whole. 
<p>
SOURCE OF THE LIMITATIONS
<p>
Dickson C.J.C. and La Forest J. hint at their eventual conclusion at the beginning of the decision, when they quote the Court of Appeal's remark that &quot;s. 35(1) of the <cite>Constitution Act, 1982</cite> does not purport to revoke the power of Parliament to act under Head 12 or 24. The power to regulate fisheries, including Indian access to the fisheries, continues ...&quot;<sup><a href ="#thirtynine">39</a></sup> The key passage in which the Court introduces its view of limitations is as follows:
<blockquote>
There is no explicit language in the provision that authorizes this Court or any court to assess the legitimacy of any government legislation that restricts aboriginal rights. Yet we find that the words &quot;recognition and affirmation&quot;  incorporate the fiduciary relationship referred to earlier and so import some restraint on the
exercise of sovereign power. Rights that are recognized and affirmed are not absolute. Federal legislative powers continue, including, of course, the right to legislate with respect to Indians pursuant to s. 91(24) of the <cite>Constitution Act, 1867</cite>. These powers must, however, now be read together with s. 35(1). In other words, federal power must be reconciled with federal duty and the best way to achieve that reconciliation is to demand the justification of any government regulation that infringes upon or denies aboriginal rights.<sup><a href="#forty">40</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The Court here introduces restrictions on Aboriginal rights that are not rooted in the text of s. 35(1), but in a vision of constitutional integrity. If the Constitution entrenches a subject matter---Aboriginal rights---that must be protected from government incursion, and at the same time gives power over Aboriginal people and the subject matters in respect of which they may exercise Aboriginal rights to the federal and provincial governments under ss.
91 and 92, neither the governmental power nor the protection of Aboriginal rights can be absolute. It is this conflict of power that underlies the Supreme Court's introduction of limitations, rather than any of the pragmatic reasons to which the British Columbia Court of Appeal refers in its decision regarding the increasingly complex world in which Aboriginal rights exist.<sup><a href="#fortyone">41</a></sup>These pragmatic concerns may well inform the <i>ways</i> in which the rights are limited, but they are not the <i>source</i> of the limitation. In this sense, it
is not so much a matter of limiting Aboriginal rights under s. 35(1). Both Aboriginal rights and legislative power are limited by each other, to the extent that they interfere with each other. It is a mutual limitation. Policing the border between Aboriginal rights and governmental power is, in the Court's view, the fiduciary obligation,<sup><a href="#fortytwo">42</a></sup> which gives rise to the Court's `test' for justifying infringements of s. 35(1).
<p>
NATURE OF THE LIMITATIONS
<p>
Dickson C.J.C. and La Forest J. propose that a court must ask &quot;certain questions&quot; in determining whether Aboriginal rights have been interfered with: 
<blockquote>
[f]irst, is the limitation unreasonable?  Second, does the regulation impose undue hardship?  Third, does the regulation deny to the holders of the right their preferred means of exercising that right? ... [T]he test involves asking whether either the purpose or the effect of the restriction on net length unnecessarily infringes the interests protected by the fishing right.<sup><a href="#fortythree">43</a></sup>
</blockquote>
This standard does not need to be very high---the Court refers to the demonstration of  &quot;some negative effect.&quot;<sup><a href ="#fortyfour">44</a></sup> Under a broad and generous interpretation of s. 35(1), which views the right with sensitivity &quot;to the aboriginal perspective ... on the meaning of the rights at stake,&quot;<sup><a href="#fortyfive">45</a></sup> a court should not encounter a great deal of difficulty finding that requiring an Aboriginal person to travel to the nearest licensing bureau in order to be permitted to fish, rather than allowing that person to simply put his net in the water when he wishes, denies that person his preferred means of exercising the right.<sup><a href="#fortysix">46</a></sup> Further, if one considers <i>prima facie</i> interference with Aboriginal rights in the light of fiduciary principles, it becomes clear that the threshold must not be very high at all. 
<p>
To outline how fiduciary principles come into play under s. 35(1), I return to the idea stated above that it is the Crown's fiduciary obligation that polices the border between Aboriginal rights and governmental power. The fiduciary obligation means that when the government exercises its power, it must do so in a way that upholds its duty to act in a &quot;trust-like, rather than adversarial&quot; manner;<sup><a href="#fortyseven">47</a></sup> federal power must be reconciled with federal duty. When considering the `test' for <i>prima facie</i> interference under s. 35(1), it is important to consider what the beneficiary of a fiduciary obligation, in private law, must show when she alleges a breach of that obligation. In particular, a beneficiary need not even show that she has been harmed
by the breach. As La Forest J. pointed out in <cite>Lac Minerals v. International Corona Resources</cite>, &quot;[f]iduciary law, being concerned with the exaction of a duty of loyalty, does not require
that harm in the particular case be shown to have resulted.&quot;<sup><a href="#fortyeight">48</a></sup> I will discuss
below why the Court determined that, in the case of s. 35(1), a rightholder must show some harm, but my point here is that since fiduciary law does not generally require any harm to be shown, the threshold that the Court proposes should be interpreted to be quite low.
<p>
The Court phrases certain aspects of this test of  <i>prima facie</i> infringement in terms that suggest that s. 35(1) requires more than a showing that an Aboriginal right has been interfered with: the Justices refer to &quot;unreasonable,&quot;  &quot;undue&quot; and &quot;unnecessary&quot; infringements of Aboriginal rights. The Court seems to be suggesting that the plaintiff has the responsibility for showing that the infringement is unreasonable or unnecessary, which is entirely out of keeping with the adjudication of rights.<sup><a href="#fortynine">49</a></sup> Under the <cite>Charter</cite>, for example, the plaintiff only has to show the effect the impugned legislation has on <i>him</i>, not whether this effect can somehow be justified in the grand scheme of things.<sup><a href="#fifty">50</a></sup> The Court cannot be taken to be holding that under s. 35(1), the plaintiff must show the unnecessariness or the unreasonableness of the regulation in question simply to get into court in the first place. Not only would such an approach place a heavy burden on the plaintiff just to get through the door, but the evidence required to show &quot;unreasonableness&quot; is likely to be in the government's possession, not the
plaintiff's.<sup><a href="#fiftyone">51</a></sup> &quot;Unnecessary&quot; and &quot;unreasonable,&quot;  then, must be
taken to be words attempting to prevent frivolous or vexatious uses of s. 35(1), and not to be imposing standards of justification.
<p>
The Court supports this interpretation later in its judgment when, in rejecting the `public interest' justification of infringements of s. 35(1), it comments that &quot;the fact that the objective is of a `reasonable' nature cannot suffice as constitutional recognition and affirmation of aboriginal rights.&quot;<sup><a href="#fiftytwo">52</a></sup>  It cannot be the law that while `reasonableness' is <i>insufficient</i> to justify an infringement of an Aboriginal right,
`reasonableness' <i>is</i> sufficient to pre-empt the justification analysis in the first place. Such a result could hardly be consonant with s. 35(1)'s purpose of reversing the problem of ignoring and failing to honour Aboriginal rights.<sup><a href="#fiftythree">53</a></sup> It is worth keeping in mind, however, that the Court's use of the word &quot;unreasonable&quot;  here, given that s. 1 of the <cite>Charter</cite> uses the word <cite>reasonable</cite> as the touchstone for a justifiable limit, has the potential to blur the two stages of analysis.
<p>
JUSTIFYING LIMITATIONS: THE PUBLIC FIDUCIARY STANDARD
<p>
Dickson C.J.C. and La Forest J. write that: 
<blockquote>
the honour of the Crown is at stake in dealings with aboriginal peoples. The special trust relationship and the
responsibility of the government vis-&agrave;-vis aboriginals must be the first consideration in determining whether the legislation or action in question can be justified.<sup><a href="#fiftyfour">54</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The fiduciary obligation, then, is the primary reference point for justification, and must inform the entire process.
Immediately following this strong statement, however, the Court notes that this presents a problem in the context of the government's legislative power: &quot;[t]he constitutional recognition and affirmation of aboriginal rights may give rise to conflict with the interests of others given the limited nature of the resource.&quot;<sup><a href="#fiftyfive">55</a></sup> In raising these two points together, the Court identifies the problem implicit in the concept of infusing government action with a fiduciary duty: how can the government, whose role is to act in the interests of all, also act with a duty of utmost loyalty toward Aboriginal people?  
<p>
The Court relies on its earlier decision in <cite>Guerin</cite> in contemplating the government's fiduciary obligation. In that case Dickson J. found that land surrendered to the federal Crown for sale or other disposition, under s. 18(1) of the <cite>Indian Act</cite><sup><a href="#fiftysix">56</a></sup>, was impressed with a fiduciary obligation. This obligation is rooted in the Royal Proclamation which, in asserting European sovereignty
over lands traditionally occupied by Aboriginal peoples, interposed the Crown between Aboriginal holders of title and third parties. If a band sought to dispose of its land, as the Musqueam Band sought to do in <cite>Guerin</cite>, it first had to surrender title to the Crown, and the Crown would then have the discretion to dispose of the land as it saw fit. As Dickson J. stated, &quot;... Parliament has conferred a discretion upon the Crown to decide for itself where the Indians' best interests really lie.&quot;<sup><a href="#fiftyseven">57</a></sup> While Dickson J.'s formulation of the obligation is rather paternalistic in this passage, he underlines the Crown's power in
this relationship. It is the broad power of the Crown that is reined in by the fiduciary obligation.
<p>
When considering the evolution of the fiduciary concept from the circumstances of  <cite>Guerin</cite> to those in <cite>Sparrow</cite>, at least one crucial difference is obvious. When the Musqueam surrendered their land to the Crown for lease in <cite>Guerin</cite>, there was no reason for any broader public interest to inform the Crown's actions because it was simply acting in the place of the Band in dealing with the golf club. The Crown's role was very similar to that of a private trustee, and its role was to act solely in the interests of the Band. In <cite>Sparrow</cite>, however, as noted above, the legislature cannot act with utmost loyalty because the public
interest <i>is</i> implicated in the regulation of the fisheries. As such, the nature of the fiduciary duty discussed in <cite>Sparrow</cite> must be different from the duty breached in <cite>Guerin</cite>, even though the source is the same: the government's assumption, through the assertion of sovereignty, of rights that historically inhered in
Aboriginal peoples themselves.
<p>
The concept of justification is not itself incompatible with fiduciary principles. For example, a beneficiary &quot;is perfectly free to permit&quot; a fiduciary's conflict of interest, so long as the fiduciary proves that he fully informed the beneficiary of the circumstances.<sup><a href="#fiftyeight">58</a></sup> In <cite>Sparrow</cite>, the government-as-fiduciary is clearly in a conflict of interest, because in regulating the fishery for the benefit of the public at large, it
is seeking to further an objective other than the benefit of Aboriginal people and, in doing so, is purporting to act both for an Aboriginal people <i>and</i> for the other group---a classic conflict of interest situation.<sup><a href="#fiftynine">59</a></sup>
<p>
In dealing with this problem, Dickson C.J.C. and La Forest J. allow for three adjustments of standard fiduciary principles. First, the prerequisite of a <i>prima facie</i> infringement requires that some effect on an Aboriginal group be shown before requiring the fiduciary to answer for it. Second, the Crown is permitted to hold an interest
other than that of the beneficiary (the Aboriginal group) to be of primary import. Instead of demanding strict loyalty from the Crown, the Court allows the public interest to be taken into account when considering legislative action, and finds that conservation measures must take priority over Aboriginal interests.<sup><a href="#sixty">60</a></sup> Third, the Court imposes a duty of consultation on the Crown. In this way, the Court takes the possibility of justification under fiduciary principles, and the <cite>Charter</cite> justification analysis with which it is familiar, and creatively synthesizes them to protect both Aboriginal rights and the public interest.
<p>
While the standard the Court imposes is very strict,<sup><a href="#sixtyone">61</a></sup> it is important to note that it is not as strict as the standard demanded from fiduciaries in private law. It resembles, instead, a half-way point between the fiduciary standard and the `good faith' standard,<sup><a href="#sixtytwo">62</a></sup> and I will refer to it as the `public fiduciary standard.'  The standard is higher than good faith, because the Court clearly conceives that the legislature must make positive efforts to preserve Aboriginal rights, as opposed to simply having regard for them; further, while the `good faith' standard can apply to adversaries in a bargaining context, the Crown here is expressly
forbidden from acting as an adversary.<sup><a href="#sixtythree">63</a></sup> The Court goes on to give examples of questions to be asked when considering the validity of legislation: is the Aboriginal right minimally infringed?  has fair compensation been awarded in the case of an expropriation?  has consultation occurred?<sup><a href="#sixtyfour">64</a></sup> The Court emphasizes that this is not an exhaustive list. Different circumstances of the exercise of legislative power will give rise to different issues to be addressed. The general principle of the &quot;honour of the Crown,&quot; however, suggests that fiduciary standards should be observed whenever possible, to be reduced to the public fiduciary standard only when circumstances make it impossible to uphold such a high level of loyalty. 
<p>
The duty of consultation is, in my view, an appropriate means by which the government's duty to the public may be reconciled with its duty to Aboriginal peoples. The fiduciary obligation is rooted in the Crown's assertion of control over something that rightfully belongs to Aboriginal people. In the context of <cite>Guerin</cite>, for example, the interposition of the Crown between the Musqueam and the Shaughnessy Golf Club has taken away the Musqueam's own ability to simply sell or otherwise dispose of their interest in land. This ability, recognized in cases such as <cite>Calder v. Attorney-General (British Columbia)</cite>, is not an interest &quot;depend[ent] on treaty, executive order or legislative enactment.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixtyfive">65</a></sup> Similarly, in extending the fiduciary obligation to the government's legislative power, the Supreme Court recognized the fact that were it not for the assertion of Crown sovereignty, Aboriginal people themselves would exercise a similar power over their lives today. The fiduciary obligation attaches because of the &quot;historic powers and responsibility assumed by the Crown&quot; over Aboriginal peoples.<sup><a href="#sixtysix">66</a></sup>
When the Court imposed a duty of consultation on the government, it recognized this assumption of power and that the government was in a compromised position in having to uphold both its fiduciary obligation to the Musqueam as well as its obligation to act in the public interest. 
<p>
By requiring the government to consult with the Aboriginal groups whose rights will be affected by a legislative measure, the Court is reducing the conflict of interest situation entailed by the government's position by enabling Aboriginal people to have a say in the protection of their rights under s. 35(1). Consultation, then, is a crucial aspect of the discharge of the Crown's fiduciary duty and must be meaningful.
<p>
To summarize this treatment of <cite>Sparrow</cite>, I would like to emphasize two aspects of the decision that face future courts. The first is that a court must give significant weight to the perspective of the Aboriginal group asserting the right, so as to give meaning to the phrase &quot;integral to their distinctive culture.&quot;  In doing so, it must avoid looking at the right from a majoritarian perspective, or through the distorting lens of existing regulations. The second aspect is that while the Court determines that Aboriginal rights cannot be absolute in their constitutionalized form, a rigorous test of justification must be applied to legislation or regulation attempting to curtail their exercise. A simple claim that the `public interest' demands it is insufficient: the government must
demonstrate that it has upheld its duty as a `public fiduciary.'  The list of questions the Court proposes is not exhaustive, nor cast in stone, but the duty of consultation is a vital element in ensuring that the government has discharged its fiduciary duty.
<p>
<center><h3>Part Two: The British Columbia Court of Appeal and <cite>Sparrow</cite></h3></center>
<b>1. Introduction</b>
<p>
This part of the article will explore the British Columbia Court of Appeal's approach to these two aspects of <cite>Sparrow</cite>. My thesis is that after setting itself on a potentially powerful direction in the early parts of <cite>Delgamuukw</cite>, the majority of the Court lost its way by overlooking the substance behind the
phrases &quot;integral part of their distinctive culture&quot; and &quot;honour of the Crown.&quot;  Each of the cases I will be discussing addresses a different facet of  <cite>Sparrow</cite>'s challenge, with <cite>Van der
Peet</cite> dealing with the content of Aboriginal rights, <cite>Nikal</cite> concerning infringement of and limitations on rights, and <cite>Gladstone</cite> touching on both. Before discussing these cases, I will
briefly deal with <cite>Delgamuukw</cite> which, while not the subject of this article, set an important foundation for the fishing rights cases in adopting <cite>Sparrow</cite>'s interpretive lens.
<p>
DELGAMUUKW
<p>
The subject matter of this case is of enormous moment, and gave rise to correspondingly wide-ranging decisions from both the British Columbia Supreme Court and Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal accepted that Aboriginal rights to the land were not extinguished by the colonial instruments known as the `<cite>Calder</cite> XIII,'<sup><a href="#sixtyseven">67</a></sup> but rejected the claim that these rights amounted to ownership, on the grounds that previous case law had conclusively determined that Aboriginal title could not constitute ownership<sup><a href="#sixtyeight">68</a></sup> because it did not amount to exclusive occupation.<sup><a href="#sixtynine">69</a></sup> The Court also rejected the Gitksan Wet'suwet'en's assertion of governmental power on similar grounds, holding that the
trial judge was correct to have concluded that the plaintiffs were asserting legislative power, and since the division of powers between the federal and provincial governments was exhaustive, it was &quot;inconceivable&quot; that an Aboriginal power of government could have survived.<sup><a href="#seventy">70</a></sup>
<p>
The only comment I would like to make on <cite>Delgamuukw</cite> concerns its treatment of  &quot;the Aboriginal perspective&quot; and the determination of Aboriginal rights by reference to &quot;that which is integral to their distinctive culture.&quot;  I suggested above that these phrases are the touchstones arising from the <cite>Sparrow</cite> decision to be used by courts in considering Aboriginal rights. In <cite>Sparrow</cite>,
however, these phrases only come up in passing commentary by the Court, and are not discussed in much detail. Instead, it is in <cite>Delgamuukw</cite> where the phrases are seized upon by the British Columbia Court of Appeal and transformed into the defining characteristics of Aboriginal rights, with Macfarlane J.A. emphasizing and repeating that  &quot;[t]he nature and content of an aboriginal right is determined by asking what the organized <i>aboriginal society regarded</i> as `an integral part of their distinctive culture'.&quot;<sup><a href="#seventyone">71</a></sup> [Emphasis added.]
<p>
If these phrases are considered with a view to taking Aboriginal rights seriously, they have the potential to give meaningful protection to Aboriginal rights. Macfarlane J.A.'s adoption of these phrases, then, could constitute a significant advance in providing this protection. <cite>Delgamuukw</cite> itself, however, gives some clue about how the Court of Appeal majority chose to apply these phrases as a `test' for Aboriginal rights. For example, under the heading of  &quot;Ownership,&quot; Macfarlane J.A. deals with the trial judge's treatment of the proof of ownership the plaintiffs had provided, noting that &quot;he discounted them considerably because of the process
by which they were prepared: these affidavits incorporated the opinions of members of the plaintiffs' community which have been exposed over the years to heated and biased discussion about the land claims controversy. This cast doubt on their utility in establishing a reputation of the plaintiffs' use and ownership of the territory.&quot;<sup><a href="#seventytwo">72</a></sup>
<p>
If a court is able to discount the worth of the evidence provided by the Aboriginal people concerned because it is `biased,' it is difficult to see how appropriate weight could ever be given to their perspective, as suggested by <cite>Sparrow</cite>. Indeed, it seems suspicious to discount Aboriginal evidence due to `bias':  how could
<i>any</i> of the witnesses involved in a case such as <cite>Delgamuukw</cite> be un-`biased,' given the philosophical and political challenges it presents?  The Court compounds this problem, in the very next paragraph, with its treatment of the evidence of a non-Aboriginal settler. In adopting McEachern C.J.S.C.'s view on ownership, the Court repeats his finding that:
<blockquote>
it is impossible to infer a community reputation for an interest in land when a prominent, life-long resident in the area like Mr. Shelford, a member of the legislature for many years, and a Cabinet minister for a time, who acknowledges hearing about general land claims for a long time, has never heard until very recently of claims of ownership or jurisdiction, or claims to specific lands, including his own, by chiefs whose family he has known personally for most of his life.<sup><a href="#seventythree">73</a></sup>
</blockquote>
What is it that makes Mr. Shelford's evidence <i>un</i>biased and the Gitksan-Wet'su-wet'en's evidence biased?  The Court appears to be suggesting that Mr. Shelford is somehow an uninterested observer, and, since he is a prominent member of the community (whose?), a Cabinet minister, and has lived there his whole life, he is a superior witness. Yet McEachern C.J.S.C. notes that Mr. Shelford's <i>own</i> land is the subject of the action. How can accepting the evidence of one non-Aboriginal settler over the evidence of a group of Aboriginal plaintiffs have anything to do with  &quot;be[ing] sensitive to the Aboriginal perspective&quot;?
<p>
This small passage from <cite>Delgamuukw</cite> is an example of the general problem of characterization that the Court of Appeal must deal with in the three cases I will be discussing here, because the Court is in the position of defining Aboriginal culture for legal purposes. Adjudicating s. 35 involves exercising the power of characterization: above, we have the characterization of some witnesses as `biased'; in <cite>Sparrow</cite>, the Court characterized the Musqueam right as a right to fish for  &quot;food, social and ceremonial purposes.&quot;  Many other questions are created by Macfarlane J.A.'s conception of Aboriginal rights. When is something &quot;integral&quot;? What makes Aboriginal culture &quot;distinctive&quot;?  When is an asserted right an &quot;evolved&quot; form of a &quot;traditional&quot; Aboriginal right, that may be protected by s. 35, and when is an asserted right a `new' right that is not?  What <i>is</i> Aboriginal culture?  Is it something that must be considered in isolation from all external influences (and what would make these influences `external'?), or does it encompass all aspects of the life of people who call themselves Aboriginal?  
<p>
It goes without saying that these are not simple questions to answer, and the context of litigation is not a particularly fortuitous one in which to try. <cite>Sparrow</cite>'s implication that the Aboriginal perspective is the relevant one constitutes an attempt to deal with these questions unencumbered by non-Aboriginal views on Aboriginal culture. <cite>Sparrow</cite>'s holding that rights must not be limited to their present-day regulated form is another expression of this objective, in that regulations imposed by non-Aboriginal governments on all Canadians have nothing to do with Aboriginal society. Compounding this challenge is the fact that the Canadian judiciary's experience in `defining' Aboriginal culture prior to s. 35's entrenchment is rooted in the `Indianness' test forwarded in the cases dealing with s. 88 of the <cite>Indian Act</cite>. In order to see the similarity in thought process, yet dramatic difference in context, between determining `Indianness' and determining the content of Aboriginal rights, it is useful to consider s. 88.
<p>
THE LEGACY OF SECTION 88
<p>
Since s. 91(24) of the <cite>Constitution Act, 1867</cite><sup><a href="#seventyfour">74</a></sup> provides the federal
government with exclusive jurisdiction over  &quot;Indians and land reserved for Indians,&quot; provincial laws concerning, for example, motor vehicle or fishing regulation cannot apply on reserve land. Section 88 provides for the application of provincial laws to Aboriginal people if they are &quot;laws of general application.&quot;  To
determine whether a law is of general application, a two-stage test was developed in the Supreme Court: first, the court must decide whether the law impinges on `Indianness' or the status and capacity of being an Indian, and second, it must decide whether the law's policy or intent was to alter or affect this core of `Indianness.'<sup><a href="#seventyfive">75</a></sup> Although these cases do not squarely raise questions of the content of Aboriginal rights,
they did put the Court in a position of deciding, for legal purposes, what characteristics of Indian life are considered to be `truly Indian.'  The Court determined that `traditional' Indian activities were considered to be at the core of Indianness, such as certain hunting practices in <cite>Kruger and Manuel</cite>, while activities seen to be non-Indian in nature, such as manufacturing in <cite>Four B Manufacturing</cite>, were ruled to be outside this core.
<p>
Four B Manufacturing was a company, owned by the Brant brothers, operating a shoe factory on the Tyendinaga reserve at the Bay of Quinte. The United Garment Workers of America had been certified by the Ontario Labour Relations Board as the exclusive bargaining agent for the factory's employees, and Four B sought to have the
certification order quashed, arguing that the <cite>Ontario Labour Relations Act</cite> could not apply to the company's activities because it impinged on federal jurisdiction under s. 91(24). In the heart of the decision, Beetz J. makes two points: first, because the context here is not restricted to the Mohawks but also includes the rights of
non-Indian workers, as well as labour relations in general in the province, Four B's enterprise cannot be considered to be solely relating to Indians. Second, even if  &quot;the situation is <i>considered from the sole point of view of Indian employees</i> and as if the employer were an Indian, neither Indian status is at stake nor rights so closely connected with Indian status that they should be regarded as necessary incidents of status such for instance as
registrability, membership in a band, the right to participate in the election of chiefs and band councils, reserve privileges, etc.&quot;<sup><a href="#seventysix">76</a></sup> [emphasis added.]
<p>
The second point is of great concern. Beetz J. suggests that he is considering the situation from the point of view of the Mohawk employees, and yet his view of what makes an Indian an Indian is informed solely by the terms of the <cite>Indian Act</cite> itself: he relies on matters related to `Indian status' under that Act. I think it is important to keep this slippery vantage point in mind. Even if it was in any way valid, in 1979, to consider `Indianness' to be
determinable by reference to laws creating the status of `Indian,' it is clearly unacceptable to do so now, given <cite>Sparrow</cite>'s conclusion that the rights recognized and affirmed in s. 35(1) are not defined by their present regulated state. Further, the idea that a particular aspect of Indian life cannot be &quot;so closely connected&quot; to being an Indian must be regarded as a highly controversial one, and <cite>Delgamuukw</cite> and the companion cases can be properly seen as part of an ongoing struggle for the power of definition. <cite>Sparrow</cite>, however, firmly asks the question: if we are to view Aboriginal rights from the perspective of the Aboriginal rightholders, how is it legally valid to take away the ability of self-definition from the Aboriginal people involved?  `Leakage' from pre-<cite>Sparrow</cite> law, such as the ideas contained in the s. 88 cases, should concern us.
<p>
<b> 2. The Content of Aboriginal Rights: Van der Peet and Gladstone</b>
<p>
FISHING RIGHTS REVISITED
<p>
A few comments about the concept of commercial rights to fish are in order, since all of the cases deal with fishing, all but one involve the sale of fish products, and the cases are all cast against the backdrop of `illegal' trade in fish by Aboriginal people.<sup><a href="#seventyseven">77</a></sup> Control over the fisheries is a highly controversial issue. It may be that the only way to effectively resolve the issue of who has the ability to sell fish and with what priority is through negotiation. Regardless of the eventual answer to the question, commercial fishing pushes a court, perhaps more than other issues, to give meaning to <cite>Sparrow</cite>'s promise that Aboriginal rights be taken seriously, that they be viewed through the eyes of the Aboriginal claimants involved, and that they not be defined by reference to their present regulated state. The fishery is highly regulated in present-day British Columbia. As a result, when one looks at commercial fishing, one is forced to look at it through many layers of regulation, because the non-Aboriginal commercial fishery has always been regulated. There is a danger that the courts may reason that because the activities giving rise to these cases are illegal <i>today</i>, there cannot be an Aboriginal right to engage in them.<sup><a href="#seventyeight">78</a></sup> The fact remains, however, that <cite>Sparrow</cite> requires a court to strip away the layers of non-Aboriginal regulation and view the right in its original form.<sup><a href="#seventynine">79</a></sup>
<p>
 A. <cite>Van der Peet</cite>
<p>
Dorothy Van der Peet's case raises highly controversial issues from very modest circumstances: she was charged under the <cite>British Columbia Fishery (General) Regulations</cite> when she sold two salmon to a friend. At trial, she raised her Aboriginal rights as a member of the Sto:Lo Nation in her defence. Scarlett P.C.J. rejected this defence, holding that the Sto:Lo had no such Aboriginal right. On appeal to the British Columbia County Court, Selbie J. reversed, finding that Mrs. Van der Peet was exercising a `modernized' form of the Sto:Lo's traditional Aboriginal rights. The Crown appealed, and the Court of Appeal, in a narrow majority, agreed with the trial judge's decision that the Sto:Lo had no Aboriginal right to sell fish. This case engages the first part of <cite>Sparrow</cite>'s analysis, as outlined above: what does s. 35 protect?  It also takes a step beyond <cite>Sparrow</cite>, since in Mrs. Van der Peet's case, there was significant disagreement over the historical
evidence required to prove the right.
<p>
In <cite>Delgamuukw</cite>, Macfarlane J.A. noted the danger that old, inappropriate legal concepts could be unconsciously applied to Aboriginal cases in a way that would fail to uphold the purposes of s. 35(1).<sup><a href="#eighty">80</a></sup> In contemplating what might be occurring &quot;unconsciously&quot; in a decision, it is important to consider the language judges use, or do not use, to describe the concepts and issues raised in a case.<sup><a href="#eightyone">81</a></sup> One notable aspect of the Court's decision in <cite>Van der Peet</cite> is that although Macfarlane J.A. emphasizes that &quot;the Aboriginal perspective&quot; is crucial in resolving s. 35(1) issues in <cite>Delgamuukw</cite>, he does not mention this perspective at all in <cite>Van der Peet</cite>.<sup><a href="#eightytwo">82</a></sup> Indeed, he does not mention the concept of perspective once in the entire decision,
implying that there is somehow an objective point of view from which to adjudicate Mrs. Van der Peet's rights. His acceptance of the trial judge's view that when Mrs. Van der Peet's ancestors began trading with the British, they were engaging in something &quot;clearly different in nature and quantity from aboriginal activity&quot;<sup><a href="#eightythree"> 83</a></sup> underlines this notion, and makes it necessary to examine exactly what made it so obvious for the trial judge that Mrs. Van der Peet was not exercising an Aboriginal right.
<p>
<i>At trial</i>
<br>
The &quot;unconscious&quot; workings of Scarlett P.C.J.'s mind in <cite>Van der Peet</cite> are perhaps best encapsulated by his use of the troubling phrase &quot;aboriginal times,&quot; which Macfarlane J.A. also uses.<sup><a href="#eightyfour">84</a></sup> He writes that &quot;no regularized trade in salmon existed in aboriginal times. Such trade as took place was either for ceremonial purposes or opportunistic exchanges taking place on a casual basis. Such trade as did take place was incidental only.&quot;<sup><a href="#eightyfive">85</a></sup> Now, what exactly are &quot;aboriginal times&quot;? While the phrase may simply serve the relatively harmless purpose of identifying the pre-contact era, it suggests that we are no longer in Aboriginal Times. It suggests that we are now in `European times,' and that Aboriginal culture is now to be defined by reference to the pre-contact era <i>only</i>, which was not the Supreme Court's view in <cite>Sparrow</cite>.<sup><a href="#eightysix">86</a></sup> The Supreme Court firmly rejected the `frozen rights' theory partly because it imposed an arbitrary time limit---1982---on the development of Aboriginal rights.<sup><a href="eightyseven">87</a></sup> Relying on the assertion of sovereignty as the `cut-off' for
the development of these rights imposes a similarly arbitrary limit, and is just as external to Aboriginal culture as was the date on which s. 35(1) was entrenched. It also accords, in my view, an overstated importance to the arrival of European settlers, similar to McEachern C.J.S.C.'s preference of Mr. Shelford's evidence over that of the Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en, that is inconsonant with the idea of viewing the practice from the perspective of the Aboriginal people involved. Such an attitude is also not in keeping with <cite>Sparrow</cite>'s holding that Aboriginal rights must be allowed to `evolve' and must be affirmed in a contemporary manner.
<p>
In addition to imposing this arbitrary cut-off, Scarlett P.C.J. performed some intriguing characterization operations on the right Mrs. Van der Peet asserted. He held that whatever trade the Sto:Lo might have engaged in prior to contact, it was merely &quot;opportunistic&quot; and not &quot;regularized.&quot;  In <cite>Sparrow</cite>, the
Supreme Court did not provide a very compelling reason for defining the right as one to fish for &quot;food, social, and ceremonial purposes&quot; rather than, for example, as a `right to fish.'  Here, Scarlett P.C.J. also exercises the court's power of definition: by calling the trade in fish &quot;opportunistic,&quot; he suggests that it was insufficient to constitute an Aboriginal right. But this holding simply begs the question. How does he know, for example, that the Sto:Lo do not have a right to `trade opportunistically' in fish, whatever that might mean?  Why does the trade need to have been extensive?  More importantly, how can he state categorically that what Mrs. Van der Peet, and the Sto:Lo Nation in general, do today cannot constitute a `modern' form of their Aboriginal right to trade in fish, however it is defined?  Scarlett P.C.J. says that the practice, in &quot;aboriginal times,&quot; was &quot;clearly different&quot; from their post-contact activity.<sup><a href="#eightyeight">88</a></sup> But if all Mrs.
Van der Peet did was sell two fish to her friend, is this act not an &quot;opportunistic&quot; sale, totally in keeping with the judge's characterization of the right?  Similarly, why is it that the arrival of hungry White settlers on the British Columbia coast cannot be characterized as the biggest opportunity for trade the Sto:Lo had ever encountered?
<p>
Scarlett P.C.J.'s decision also underlines courts' seeming inability to manage the evidence that might be adduced to demonstrate the meaning of the right, which may differ from the evidence to which they are accustomed.<sup><a href="#eightnine">89</a></sup> Essentially, Mrs. Van der Peet is faulted because her ancestors did not keep records sufficient to satisfy the trial judge. Scarlett P.C.J. deals with the evidence provided on behalf of Mrs. Van der Peet, saying at the outset that &quot;[c]aution had to be exercised in weighing the evidence of Natives which relied upon childhood
experience and recollection and expert opinion derived from subjective observation and analysis of such
recollection,&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety">90</a></sup> and concluding that &quot;[w]hile such evidence is always interesting and often fascinating, it embodied heresay [sic] often unrelated to or at variance to such historical record as was available.&quot;<sup><a href ="#ninetyone">91</a></sup> To suggest that the oral history related to the Sto:Lo witnesses contradicted the &quot;historical record&quot; is to suggest that oral history is not history at all. It is the evidence of the anthropological experts that sways the court.<sup><a href="#ninetytwo">92</a></sup> And yet every expert who testified, according to Scarlett P.C.J., said that the Sto:Lo <i>did</i> trade in salmon, and it is not clear what, other than the arrival of the Hudson's Bay Company, makes that trade so different from the modern-day sale of fish. 
<P>
<i>On Appeal: Macfarlane J.A.'s Majority Opinion</i>
<br>
Macfarlane J.A. fails to resolve any of these difficulties, and this failure must be considered all the more
serious given his emphasis on adopting the Aboriginal perspective in <cite>Delgamuukw</cite>. In <cite>Van der Peet</cite>, one might have expected some commentary on Scarlett P.C.J.'s treatment of the evidence of the
Sto:Lo witnesses, as compared to that of the expert witnesses, especially given that the summary appeal judge thought that Scarlett P.C.J.'s opinion was coloured by irrelevant considerations.<sup><a href="#ninetythree">93</a></sup> While appeal courts consistently decide that they should not overturn a trial court's finding of fact, I believe that it would have been highly appropriate for Macfarlane J.A. to make some comment about the trial judge's approach to the facts before him. That said, however, Macfarlane J.A.'s own view of the issue is even more problematic
because of what he adds and takes away from the <cite>Sparrow</cite> analysis.
<p>
One aspect of Macfarlane J.A.'s decision that is immediately notable is the revival of the frozen rights fallacy. He asks whether &quot;there [is] a commercial aspect to the aboriginal right to fish which was an integral part of the distinctive culture of the Sto:lo people?&quot;<sup><a href="#ninetyfour">94</a></sup> This formulation is accurate, but he then adds that he 
<blockquote>
put[s] the question that way because this case is not about the casual disposal of surplus food fish. In essence, it is about an asserted Indian right to sell fish allocated for food purposes on a commercial basis. The result would be to give Indian fishers a preference or priority over other Canadians who seek a livelihood from commercial fishing.<sup><a href="#ninetyfive">95</a></sup>
</blockquote>
By defining the right in this way---to sell fish, allocated for one purpose, for another purpose---Macfarlane J.A. reads the regulation into the right. The Aboriginal right to fish, while it may have aspects of self-regulation, is not about `allocation': that is the sole creation of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO). What is it that makes fish &quot;surplus food fish&quot;?  If the sale of fish is necessary to the Sto:Lo's survival, for example, then it is
not `surplus': it is only surplus because the numbers have exceeded the DFO allocation for the Sto:Lo fishers. But allocation has little to do with the Aboriginal right. This characterization of the right, performed with no attempt to extricate himself from the heavily-regulated fisheries context, aids Macfarlane J.A. in finding that the Sto:Lo have no such right. This conclusion is not surprising, however, because he has basically suggested that the Sto:Lo are asserting a right to be law-breakers, rather than a right to observe the dictates of their own culture.<sup><a href="#ninetysix">96</a></sup>
<p>
At bottom, the issue in {\itl Van der Peet} and the other commercial fishing cases is whether the dramatic increase in Aboriginal trade in fish following the arrival of European traders, even if it were shown that the Europeans are the `cause' of present-day Aboriginal trade in fish, can be determinative of Aboriginal rights protected by
s. 35(1). The issue is fundamentally about characterization. Is the &quot;opportunistic&quot; trade practised prior to the arrival of the Europeans <i>different</i> from the trade with the Hudson's Bay Company and other settlers?  The key to Macfarlane J.A.'s response to this question is his holding that &quot;[i]t is ... necessary to separate those traditions from practices which are not a unique part of Indian culture, but which are common to Indian and non-Indian alike.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninetyseven">97</a></sup> He says:
<blockquote>
The summary appeal judge was of the opinion that social changes altered the content of the aboriginal right; and that the occasional and rudimentary practice of exchanging fish in the aboriginal community blossomed, with the arrival of the British, into a full blown right to fish to supply a non-Indian market. I recognize that the arrival of the Europeans brought new customs, new ways and new incentives; but that does not mean the unique nature of
aboriginal traditions had to conform to the practices of the British, or what they encouraged the Indians to do would shape and construct a new right for the Indians. As a practical consequence the aborigines probably began to adjust to those changes. Undoubtedly they began to sell fish on a commercial scale. But that practice, which had not
been integral to the organized society and its distinctive culture, and which was induced and driven by European influences ought not, in my opinion, to qualify for protection and priority as an aboriginal right.<sup><a href="#ninetyeight">98</a></sup>
</blockquote>
This passage indicates Macfarlane J.A.'s total subscription to the &quot;aboriginal times&quot; notion, and thus, his adoption of a `frozen' attitude toward Aboriginal rights. To say that &quot;the unique nature of aboriginal traditions [did not have] to conform to the practices of the British&quot; is to suggest that they had a choice to remain in &quot;aboriginal times&quot; and because they did not, they gave up their ability to further `modernize' their culture. Furthermore, it is to find that Aboriginal trade with the British was solely a product of British culture and could therefore not have anything to do with Aboriginal practices. Yet trade, by its very nature, requires two sides, and to say that it was &quot;induced and driven by European influences&quot; is to overlook Aboriginal peoples' role in the inception and success of the trading posts. Macfarlane J.A.'s conclusion above is driven by his concept that a practice which is a part of European culture cannot be part of an Aboriginal right <i>even if</i> the practice is common to both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal culture. 
<p>
This attitude flows from Macfarlane J.A.'s initial approach to the `test' of what is integral to Aboriginal people's distinctive culture. He appears to have interpreted this to mean that if something is integral to a culture other than that of Aboriginal people, it cannot be part of Aboriginal people's <i>distinctive</i> culture, because that which makes Aboriginal culture distinctive is that which differentiates it from non-Aboriginal culture. This view is, to put it bluntly, wrong, and it is wrong for several reasons. 
<p>
First of all, it is wrong on purely textual terms: Macfarlane J.A. is mentally substituting the word &quot;distinct&quot; for &quot;distinctive.&quot;  In the Concise Oxford English, for example, &quot;distinctive&quot; is defined as &quot;distinguishing or characteristic.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninetynine">99</a></sup> &quot;Distinct,&quot; on the other hand, is defined as &quot;1: (<i>often followed by `from'</i>) a. not identical, separate, individual; b. different in kind or quality; unlike.&quot;<sup><a href = #hundred">100</a></sup> [Emphasis added.]  While &quot;distinct&quot; mandates comparison and evaluation from a separate vantage point, &quot;distinctive&quot; requires the object to be observed on its own. While describing an object's &quot;distinctive&quot; qualities may entail describing how the object is different from others (that is,
&quot;distinguishing&quot;), there is nothing in the term that <i>requires</i> it to be different. To give a trivial example, when one describes a deerstalker cap's distinctive features, one is likely to refer to its ear flaps. But this does not mean that no other hat has such a distinctive feature, or that this fact makes the deerstalker any less a deerstalker. All that &quot;distinctive&quot; entails is identification, not differentiation. 
<p>
Second, in <cite>Sparrow</cite>, where the phrase was coined, the Supreme Court emphasized that one of the purposes of s. 35(1) was to bring Aboriginal rights into the constitutional framework and to give these
rights legal force. The Court reiterated this attitude of integration and recognition when it indicated that &quot;general principles of constitutional interpretation&quot; were appropriately applied to s. 35(1).<sup><a href="#hundredone">101</a></sup> The Court's description of the political process of getting Aboriginal rights taken seriously strongly suggests, in my view, that the Court's intention was to recognize the distinctiveness of Aboriginal rights while, at the same time, integrating them into the constitutional framework. In short, the Court's view relied on the idea of integration, not separation, even as it recognized and affirmed `unique' rights. It was certainly not <cite>Sparrow</cite>'s intention to define Aboriginal culture as that which is left over after one takes away non-Aboriginal culture, which brings me to the final reason for rejecting Macfarlane J.A.'s view.
<p>
As described earlier, part of the reason for rejecting the `frozen rights' approach in <cite>Sparrow</cite> was that Aboriginal rights could not be defined by reference to regulations, because these are external to Aboriginal culture. Saying that what is common to both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal culture must necessarily be non-Aboriginal and <i>not</i> Aboriginal is, to say the least, an overly Eurocentric approach. As Lambert J.A. later points out, presumably the European settlers had previously fished for food in Europe, but no one has suggested that Aboriginal people cannot hold a right to fish for food as well.<sup><a href="#hundredtwo">102</a></sup> Simply put, what is it that requires the common elements to disappear from the Aboriginal culture, rather than from non-Aboriginal culture? More importantly, why can distinctive features not be shared among cultures in s. 35(1) analysis?  
<p>
In suggesting that it is the Aboriginal practice which loses its identity, Macfarlane J.A. is not stating anything mandated by the nature of Aboriginal rights, but rather is enunciating a majoritarian attitude toward rights that denies the equality of peoples. We might consider this point as follows: why is it that the Sto:Lo and Sheshaht, for example, can both have an Aboriginal right to fish for food, but the Sto:Lo cannot have an Aboriginal right to trade fish because such trade is common to both Sto:Lo and European culture? The Sto:Lo culture is distinctive, and distinct from the Sheshaht culture, even though they are both Aboriginal cultures. But the magical effect European influences appear to have on the rights of the Sto:Lo, an effect that other Aboriginal cultures do not have, suggests that it is not the Aboriginal culture Macfarlane J.A. is looking at, but the presence of Europeans. He defines `Indian' as `that which is not non-Indian.'  Just as he invents the requirement of `difference,' Macfarlane J.A. also invents a new vantage point for Aboriginal rights: they are whatever is left over following a comparison between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal culture. This conclusion is a direct descendant of s. 88's legacy of defining Aboriginal culture through the perspective of non-Aboriginal sources, for which there is no normative justification in the context of
s. 35(1). Instead, the concept of taking Aboriginal rights seriously, the broad and generous approach offered by the Supreme Court in <cite>Sparrow</cite>, and the need to refer to an Aboriginal people's perspective on rights, which was emphasized in <cite>Delgamuukw</cite>, all provide a normative justification for doing the very opposite of what Macfarlane J.A. and the trial judge do. I have suggested here that Macfarlane J.A.'s application of the `integral-to-the-distinctive-culture test' is thoroughly wrong, even if the `test' itself has merit. But at bottom, <cite>Sparrow</cite> still leaves us with a basic problem of characterization: how is a court able to know when something <i>is</i> integral?  Is there any principle underlying such characterizations, or will courts always
simply favour one characterization over another?  The problem lies, in my view, in the majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal's decision to focus on practices and traditions, such as fishing for one purpose or another, rather than on something more profound. In short, the majority decided to focus on the &quot;integral parts,&quot;
rather than the &quot;distinctive culture.&quot;  Focusing on discrete parts of a culture, and separating these from the culture in which they are rooted, may enable a court to more easily translate the interests s. 35(1) protects into rights-talk, but it does not do justice to the purposes of s. 35(1). For this and other reasons, Lambert J.A. dissents from the majority opinion in <cite>Van der Peet</cite>, and proposes instead a &quot;social theory&quot; of right.
<p>
<i>On Appeal: Lambert J.A.'s Dissent</i>
<br>
Lambert J.A. recognizes that the whole issue is one of characterization, and he echoes the Supreme Court's view that the right should be characterized in a way that accords with the rightholders' point of view.<sup><a href="#hundredthree">103</a></sup> He then suggests some possible approaches to Aboriginal rights, and evaluates each of them according to how well they fit in with the Aboriginal perspective in question. In his view, a particular activity could be described according to the purpose the custom served, or the way in which the custom was regulated, or according to the role the custom played in the culture in question.<sup><a href =#hundredfour">104</a></sup> He deals with the first two alternatives very briefly, rejecting the first because it would accord more with observing the culture in
question from the perspective of the settling nation rather than that of the Aboriginal group itself, and the second because while it may attempt to view the practice from the appropriate perspective, it does not recognize the underlying significance of the practice or the reason why it should be considered to be integral.<sup><a href="#hundredfive">105</a></sup>
<p>
Lambert J.A. chooses the third alternative for a variety of reasons. He believes that this theory was &quot;foreshadowed&quot; in <cite>Sparrow</cite> when the Court wrote of protecting the &quot;integral parts of their distinctive culture&quot;; that it is in keeping with Dickson J.'s analysis of the history of the fishery in <cite>Jack</cite> and that the theory is consonant with the approach taken by the American courts in adjudicating the fishing rights of Aboriginal peoples closely related to Aboriginal peoples of the west coast of British Columbia.<sup><a href ="#hundredsix">106</a></sup> He also makes the decidedly common-sense point that if the Sto:Lo have a right to fish for food, it makes no sense in the present day to confine them to eating nothing but fish; they should be able to sell the fish in order to buy other nourishment.<sup><a href = #hundredseven">107</a></sup>
<p>
In contemplating these alternatives, I think an analogy to the <cite>Charter</cite> is useful. One way of characterizing the scope of <cite>Charter</cite> protection is to say that s. 2(b), for example, does not seek to protect particular manifestations of the freedom of expression, but to protect the ability to express. While an
individual's rant on a street corner is protected by s. 2(b), the freedom is not conceptualized as the protection of all of its possible manifestations (for example, speaking in public, speaking in class, writing in a newspaper), but as the protection of the fundamental purposes for which one might express oneself. In this sense, the speech itself is actually the third layer of s. 2(b) protection; at the core, there are the goals of individual self-realization, political activity, etc., for which freedom of expression is protected; around that is the idea that these goals may be furthered by protecting expression in general; finally, there is the actual expression chosen by a particular individual at a
particular time. If we compare this structure to the opinions expressed in <cite>Van der Peet</cite>, we find that Macfarlane and Wallace JJ.A. are seeking to protect only the outermost layer of the right, while Lambert J.A.'s theory chooses to protect the inner layers and <i>therefore</i> the outermost layer as well, to the extent that it is a manifestation of something more profound. 
<p>
While this conception of the <cite>Charter</cite> may not be acceptable to all, I think it is undeniable that the values inhering in the <cite>Charter</cite> are necessarily multi-layered and multi-faceted. This aspect of `<cite>Charter</cite> thinking' must be brought into contemplation of s. 35(1), even if a liberal conception of individual rights is inappropriate to s. 35(1). The Supreme Court could not outline the interests protected by s. 35(1) in the same fashion as it had done with the <cite>Charter</cite>, because of the undefined nature of s. 35(1). But Lambert J.A.'s view is that in proposing the key phrase &quot;integral parts of their distinctive culture,&quot; the Supreme Court was coming as close as it could to outlining a general principle regarding the purpose of the section, one that would accord Aboriginal rights the same protection as <cite>Charter</cite> rights, even as they flow from a different source. To the extent, then, that s. 35(1) may be informed by <cite>Charter</cite> thinking, it must also be seen as protecting not a series of individualized practices or customs, but the distinctive culture of which these practices and customs are a manifestation. If we look at Aboriginal rights in this manner, combined with Lambert J.A.'s reasoning, I think that he does provide a <i>principle</i> to guide the process of characterization.
<p>
At the end of his opinion, Lambert J.A. finds that Scarlett P.C.J.'s approach, and therefore Macfarlane J.A.'s, was incorrect because it misconceived the meaning of an Aboriginal right. He therefore does not address some of the difficulties in Scarlett P.C.J.'s analysis that I have outlined above, because his theory simply does not entail
asking questions such as `is this culture a band or a tribal culture?' or `was there or was there not regularized trade?'  He adds, however, that even if he had applied a `purpose' test to the circumstances of the case, he would have found that Mrs. Van der Peet's sale was protected by s. 35(1) because he has no difficulty concluding that the historical evidence of trade proves the existence of a system of exchange that was the precursor to present-day sale of fish,<sup><a href="#hundredeight">108</a></sup> and that such a finding is in keeping with <cite>Sparrow</cite>'s direction that aboriginal rights are not to be frozen in time. 
<p>
Lambert J.A.'s application of the `purpose' theory, however, when compared to the `social' theory, is much less satisfactory. There does not seem to be any underlying principle, so that even if one agrees with Lambert J.A.'s characterization of the present-day practice as `the same' as the historical practice, the identification is still nothing more than a label. He suggests that if a group of Aboriginal people began to trade with the English as soon as the
opportunity was available, then they could be said to be `evolving' their traditional practices. This formulation has the advantage of focusing on an Aboriginal group's view of the trade rather than on the Europeans', but it is still mired in an analysis of individual practices rather than an entire culture, and still seems to be imposing arbitrary time limits. For example, if the Sto:Lo had waited for fifty years following contact before deciding to trade
with the British, even though the opportunity had presented itself much earlier, why should that decision not be an `evolution' of an existing custom rather than the introduction of a new practice?  The fact that even Lambert J.A. cannot apply the purpose theory convincingly suggests to me that it is simply the wrong approach to take.
<p>
In the end, it is not clear whether Lambert J.A.'s `social theory' will actually avoid all of the problems identified in Scarlett P.C.J.'s analysis: for example, does the social theory make it any easier to evaluate historical evidence, whether in the form of oral history or in actual written records?  Does the time of European settlement matter?  Lambert J.A. does not offer us a way out of the problem that judges have the power of definition: it is still up to
them to decide what is and what is not an Aboriginal right when the issue comes to court. But Lambert J.A. does, at least, recognize this power, and in formulating an approach that he believes best accords with the idea of viewing the rights from the perspective of the rightholders, he is attempting to limit the influence of judges' own whims and biases in the definition of cultures most of them know little about. In summarizing his opinion, he notes in response to a comment from Wallace J.A.<sup><a href="#hundrednine">109</a></sup> that:
<blockquote>
I do not say that ``the scope and nature of aboriginal rights will vary depending upon the particular method of analysis chosen.&quot; I say that the description of the aboriginal right, though not the right itself, is affected by the perspective from which the right is viewed. I prefer a social perspective to a purpose perspective.<sup><a href="#oneten">110</a></sup>
</blockquote>
In describing the function of characterization in this way, Lambert J.A. clearly recognizes that judges have no power to <i>change</i> Aboriginal rights: all they can do is describe and attempt to define them. This attitude, in my view, best accords with the idea of `recognizing and affirming' Aboriginal rights under s. 35(1). More importantly, it emphasizes that the rights are in no way a product of the government, of judges or, as Wallace J.A. appears to cynically believe, of Aboriginal peoples' present-day material desires. They flow from Aboriginal peoples' prior occupancy and sovereignty. 
<p>
Even if one were not convinced by <cite>Van der Peet</cite> that the project Macfarlane J.A. sets for himself is a highly perilous one, <cite>Gladstone</cite> confirms it.<sup><a href="#oneeleven">111</a></sup> In order to see the problem in more vivid detail, it is important to recall why Macfarlane J.A. rejected Mrs. Van der Peet's claim: he believed that the right she was asserting could not be considered to be an Aboriginal right because it was `created' by European influences. In <cite>Gladstone</cite>, because extensive trade of the nature engaged in by the Gladstones existed long before the arrival of the Europeans, such a characterization is not available. Nonetheless, Macfarlane J.A. denies the existence of the right. His treatment of the right, then, is worthy of some analysis although I should warn at the outset that he offers very little to analyze in the mere twelve paragraphs he writes on the Gladstones' rights.
<p>
<i> B. Gladstone</i>
<p>
The Gladstones, members of the Heiltsuk Band, were arrested and charged with attempting to sell herring spawn on kelp contrary to the <cite>Pacific Herring Fishery Regulations</cite> when they were found with 4200 pounds of spawn in a U-Haul truck. It is useful to look at the evidence marshalled in the Gladstones' favour regarding the trade in spawn on kelp. In this case, unlike <cite>Van der Peet</cite>, the appellants were able to find persuasive anthropological evidence that the West Coast Indians, including the Heiltsuk, had engaged in extensive trading of this particular food. The expert witness noted that while some Aboriginal groups had access to spawn and others did not, it only made sense that they would trade. And trade they did: Hutcheon J.A. quotes from a report measuring the trade in &quot;tons,&quot; with &quot;flotillas&quot; of canoes travelling along the coast.<sup><a href="#onetwelve">112</a></sup> Similarly, Lambert J.A. quotes passages from English traders' diaries, in which they described the trade in herring spawn on kelp amongst Aboriginal people on the Coast, and with the Europeans themselves.<sup><a href ="#onethirteen">113</a></sup> There was little dispute that the Heiltsuk, along with other Aboriginal groups, had engaged in a burgeoning trade in herring spawn, even if this trade had waned during certain years.<sup><a href="#onefourteen">114</a></sup>
<p>
The trial judge held, however, that while the Heiltsuk may have had an Aboriginal right to trade and barter, this &quot;surreptitious&quot; attempt to sell a large amount of spawn was not in keeping with that right, and that the regulations were justified limitations on it. The summary appeal court judge, in similar fashion, also accepted the
existence of an Aboriginal right to trade in spawn, but held that this was not an &quot;absolute and unfettered right to harvest herring spawn in any quantity and to sell the spawn so harvested commercially.&quot;<sup><a href="#onefifteen">115</a></sup> The requirement of a licence for commercial sale was therefore found not to interfere with the Aboriginal right. Regardless of their conclusions, both judges determined that the Gladstones <i>were</i> exercising an Aboriginal right when they attempted to sell the herring spawn. The majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, however, overturned these findings and held that there was no such right.
<p>
This change of judicial mind is nothing short of mysterious. Macfarlane J.A. deals briefly with the lower court decisions and concludes that, in spite of their findings that the appellants were exercising Aboriginal rights, &quot;[i]t is clear that the trial judge and the summary appeal judge did not view the activity in question as
being an integral part of the distinctive culture of the Heiltsuk people. I agree that the activity is different in nature and quality than the aboriginal right identified by the evidence.&quot;<sup><a href="#onesixteen">116</a></sup> In support of this conclusion, Macfarlane J.A. notes that the trial judge did not believe that &quot;inter-tribal trade in herring
spawn was very extensive or very significant in the affairs of the Heiltsuk Band,&quot;<sup><a href="#oneseventeen">117</a></sup> although he does not offer any evidence that this was, indeed, the trial judge's view or,
more importantly, what would be required to demonstrate that the trade <i>was</i> integral.
<p>
Considering the importance Macfarlane J.A. put on the lack of evidence of pre-sovereignty trade by the Sto:Lo in <cite>Van der Peet</cite>, one would have thought that the comparatively voluminous evidence provided by the appellants in this case would at least merit comment. But he does not once mention the extensive evidence of
trade in spawn long before sovereignty. Instead, he notes, as if searching for the necessary `foreign' element that can take all Aboriginality away from an Aboriginal practice, that the commercial herring spawn fishery &quot;<i>first</i> developed in British Columbia in the early 1970s in response to a demand for the product in
Japan&quot;<sup><a href="#oneeighteen">118</a></sup> [emphasis added], thereby denying the relevance of all the other historical evidence. His decision rests, in the end, on the simple assertion that &quot;[t]he regulation in question controls commercial activity, which is not integral to aboriginal culture, and therefore cannot be said to infringe an
aboriginal right,&quot;<sup><a href ="#onenineteen">119</a></sup> a conclusion that rests, in turn, on the earlier declaration that: 
<blockquote>
the quality and character of the activity in aboriginal times was quite different from that disclosed by the evidence in this case. The aboriginal activity was rooted in a culture which gave significance to sharing a resource, to which one nation had ready access, while other Indian peoples did not.<sup><a href="#onetwenty">120</a></sup>
</blockquote>
This chain of reasoning is mysterious because it puts forward the idea that in &quot;aboriginal times,&quot; what the Heiltsuk did was to provide herring spawn for those who had no access to the resource, but what they are doing now is different; it is `commerce.'  But what is `commerce' but trading one thing, be it money or goods, for
another?  Macfarlane J.A. seems to be suggesting that the activity disclosed by the evidence somehow had cultural and political significance only, and the fact that the traders were meeting their material needs had nothing to do with the trade in herring spawn. Perhaps a definition of `commerce' and an explanation of why it is different from what the Gladstones' ancestors had participated in scores of years earlier would have been helpful, but none is provided
by Macfarlane J.A., save the scanty reasoning presented above. But how much closer could an Aboriginal group come to demonstrating that a present-day practice was a `modernized' form of a historical practice than the Gladstones did in this case?<sup><a href="#onetwentyone">121</a></sup>
<p>
Macfarlane J.A.'s reasons in <cite>Gladstone</cite> are completely infused with the idea that Aboriginal rights protect `what Indians do' so long as it is not the same as `what non-Indians do.'  While non-Aboriginal people may engage in commerce, the Heiltsuk's activity is defined as &quot;sharing a resource, to which one nation had ready
access, while other Indian peoples did not,&quot; and therefore not commerce. It is entirely possible that Macfarlane J.A., although he does not state as much, believes that the Aboriginal right is limited to this &quot;sharing&quot; only with other Aboriginal peoples, such that the attempted sale to a Japanese buyer was outside the protection of s. 35(1). But this is a simply absurd interpretation of Aboriginal rights. It gives no weight to the idea that Aboriginal rights may `evolve' in response to changing circumstances, and further, evinces no appreciation for the Heiltsuk perspective on the rights. To quote Macfarlane J.A., &quot;this is not the course set by
<cite>Sparrow</cite>.&quot;<sup><a href ="#onetwentytwo">122</a></sup>

One of the ways that <i>was</i> set by <cite>Sparrow</cite> is that the infringement of Aboriginal rights demands strict justification, since the protection of Aboriginal rights is impressed with a fiduciary obligation. The next part of this article will examine the British Columbia Court of Appeal's understanding of when an Aboriginal right is infringed and how such infringement may be justified. <cite>Nikal</cite> and <cite>Gladstone</cite> provide the context for determining whether the promise of <cite>Sparrow</cite>'s second branch was fulfilled any better than the first.
<p>
<b>3. The Limitation of Aboriginal Rights: Nikal and Gladstone</b>
<p>
The second aspect of  <cite>Sparrow</cite> addressed by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in this series of cases is the infringement of Aboriginal rights and the test for justification of those violations. In <cite>Nikal</cite>, the majority of the Court accepted that Aboriginal rights did exist as asserted, and moved directly to consider their violation. As I will discuss, even though <cite>Sparrow</cite> set a low threshold for violation, and a high standard for justification, the Court determined that Nikal's rights were not violated by the requirement that the Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en hold a licence in order to fish. In <cite>Gladstone</cite>, Hutcheon J.A. (unlike Macfarlane J.A.) decided that the Gladstones had proved a commercial fishing right, and that it had been violated, and went on
to consider whether the violation was justified. These cases provide an opportunity to follow the growth of both branches of  <cite>Sparrow</cite>'s infringement analysis at the Court of Appeal. 
<p>
<i>A. Nikal</i>
<p>
<cite>Nikal</cite> raises an issue touched on in <cite>Sparrow</cite> but left unresolved: whether the special licences issued to Aboriginal people violate their fishing rights. Jerry Nikal, a member of the Moricetown Band of the Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en, was charged with fishing without a licence after he was photographed gaff fishing in the Bulkley River. He raised two defences: first, that the Moricetown Band by-law governed fishing in the river and
that he had not breached it by not having a licence; second, that the licence requirement infringed his Aboriginal right to fish according to the customs and laws of his own people rather than those of the DFO. I will not deal with the first defence, since it was treated by all of the judges as an issue of traditional property law and interpretation rather than one of Aboriginal rights,<sup><a href="#onetwentythree">123</a></sup> and I will focus instead on the second one. It is important to note that the controversy in <cite>Nikal</cite> is not whether the Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en have a right to fish or whether they have a right to regulate this fishing, since Macfarlane J.A. apparently accepts that they have a right to `self-regulate,' but whether this right is infringed by s. 4(1) of the <cite>British Columbia Fishery (General) Regulations</cite>. As a result, <cite>Nikal</cite> engages the second branch of  <cite>Sparrow</cite>---determining when a right is infringed and whether this infringement may be justified.
<p>
Macfarlane J.A. quotes from Mr. Nikal's factum in order to describethe right asserted: 
<blockquote>
104. Self-regulation of the fishery is part of the s.35(1) right. This does not deny the Crown's overriding authority to manage the fishery. It simply requires the government to justify any interference with the right of self-regulation.
<p>
99. It is submitted that in order for the right to fish to have any substance it must include the right to carry on the fishery as it has traditionally been carried on with the people making the necessary decisions under the direction of their hereditary leaders as to when, where, how, what and for whom they would fish.<sup><a href="#onetwentyfour">124</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Several aspects of this description are noteworthy. First of all, Mr. Nikal is not arguing that the Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en right is <i>beyond the reach</i> of federal regulation, but that it exists within it and that incursions into it must be justified. The right is thus framed exactly within <cite>Sparrow</cite>'s paradigm where the Court wrote that &quot;there was from the outset never any doubt that sovereignty and legislative power ... vested in the
Crown,&quot;<sup><a href="#onetwentyfive">125</a></sup> and held that the Crown would nonetheless have to justify its interferences with Aboriginal rights. Second, the suggestion that the right involves continuing to practise fishing &quot;as it has traditionally been carried on&quot; does not refer to traditional methods or purposes, but to the historical ability of the Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en to govern how fishing was to be carried out. Lambert J.A.'s `social theory' is in accord with this description of the right, in that he too attempted to describe the right at a lower level of particularization, from which flow specific manifestations (`when, where, how, what, and for whom') of the right.
<p>
The most notable aspect of this conception of the right is that  Macfarlane J.A. does not comment at all on the passages he quotes; instead, he moves straight on to discuss infringement and justification. It may be that Macfarlane J.A.'s view in <cite>Delgamuukw</cite>, that &quot;[n]o declaration by this court is required to
permit internal self-regulation in accordance with aboriginal traditions, if the people affected are in agreement&quot;<a href="#onetwentysix">126</a></sup> is the source for this conclusion in <cite>Nikal</cite>. The conclusion has much in common with Lambert J.A.'s view in <cite>Van der Peet</cite> that if a right is recognized and affirmed by s. 35(1), the institutions under which that right is protected are also protected, including the ability to self-regulate and self-govern.<sup><a href="#onetwentyseven">127</a></sup> At any rate, Macfarlane J.A.'s view, if unstated, is that the Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en right to fish carries with it the right to regulate this fishing.<sup><a href="#onetwentyeight">128</a></sup>
<p>
Macfarlane J.A.'s conclusion in relation to the right may have been a positive one, but in my view, his analysis of whether the right was infringed shows his complete failure to try to understand the meaning of the right from the rightholders' perspective. His conclusion that the licence requirement does not even constitute a <i>prima facie</i>
infringement of the fishing right is so furtive that it merits a thorough discussion here. 
<p>
The first move Macfarlane J.A. makes is to suggest that <cite>Sparrow</cite> has already resolved the issue of whether the licence requirement infringed Aboriginal fishing rights. He comments that:  
<blockquote>
[a]lthough the licensing scheme, with which we are dealing in this appeal, was discussed by Dickson C.J.C. and La Forest in <cite>Sparrow</cite> ..., and although it was argued on behalf of Mr. Sparrow that &quot;the holders of aboriginal rights may exercise those rights according to their own discretion,&quot; ... and &quot;that the right to
regulate is part of the right to use the resource in the band's discretion&quot; ... , it was not suggested that licensing by itself constituted a <i>prima facie</i> infringement of s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.<sup><a href="#onetwentynine">129</a></sup>
</blockquote>
While this attempt at judicial dispatch may be admirable, part of the reason that licensing was not considered to be contrary to s. 35(1) in <cite>Sparrow</cite> was that the issue was not argued.<sup><a href="#onethirty">130</a></sup> Mr. Sparrow only argued that the conditions of the Musqueam licence, in imposing a particular net length, infringed
his right. Further, even if the licensing regime <i>had</i> been found not to interfere with the Musqueam right, Macfarlane J.A. himself noted in <cite>Delgamuukw</cite> that &quot;[t]he scope and content of aboriginal rights may vary from context to context in accordance with distinct patterns of historical occupancy and use of
land.&quot;<sup><a href="#onethirtyone">131</a></sup> The rights of the Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en may well differ from those of the Musqueam, but by attempting to apply <cite>Sparrow</cite> directly to Mr. Nikal's case, Macfarlane J.A. forecloses discussion of this issue.<sup><a href="#onethirtytwo">132</a></sup>
<p>
Macfarlane J.A. then comments that: 
<blockquote>
[a]t the heart of the submission on behalf of Mr. Nikal is the proposition that any government action affecting the right of self-regulation must be justified. If that is correct then the first question is not whether a <i>prima facie</i> infringement has been established by the holder of the right, but whether the Crown can justify its action. That is not the course set by <cite>Sparrow</cite>.<sup><a href="#onethirtythree">133</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Even though the above reasoning is founded on an unresolved &quot;if,&quot; he never contemplates that Mr. Nikal could be suggesting something <i>other</i> than this reasoning. &quot;Ifs&quot; are not a particularly sturdy foundation for the denial of a constitutional right. This is especially true given that the factum refers to
&quot;interference,&quot; not &quot;effect,&quot; such that, as described above, it is only mirroring the <cite>Sparrow</cite> justification process. But more importantly, Macfarlane J.A.'s view that Mr. Nikal is asserting an absolute right overlooks the nature of the right described above. If the right to fish also contains a right to regulate, as Macfarlane J.A. has apparently accepted, then it is very difficult to see how <i>any</i> regulation enacted by the federal government does not constitute a <i>prima facie</i> interference with the right, since the power to regulate the fisheries and the asserted right to self-regulate occupy the very same field, insofar as federal laws may affect the Moricetown Band. Any government action regarding the Band's fishing would, <i>by definition</i>, affect and interfere with the right of self-regulation.
<p>
Another notable &quot;if&quot; in Macfarlane J.A.'s reasoning arises in his treatment of Millward J.'s analysis of infringement. This &quot;if&quot; indicates that Macfarlane J.A. has run the two stages of <cite>Sparrow</cite> together, determining <i>prima facie</i> infringement and justification at the same time. Millward J. had held that &quot;it is important to note also that the aboriginal right includes the right, not the privilege but the right, to follow the directions of the traditional leaders of the band in conducting the fishery,&quot; and he then enumerated a number of means by which this right might manifest itself.<sup><a href="#onethirtyfour">134</a></sup> Following from
this conception of the right, Millward J. concluded that the licence requirement was a <i>prima facie</i> infringement of the right. Macfarlane J.A., after quoting this passage from Millward J.'s reasons, writes that &quot;[i]f that means to say that a right of self-regulation is an absolute right, and that any government action
affecting it is a <i>prima facie</i> infringement of s.35(1) then I disagree. It is contrary to <cite>Sparrow</cite>.&quot;<sup><a href="#onethirtyfive">135</a></sup>
<p>
This commentary is, of course, almost indistinguishable from Macfarlane J.A.'s treatment of Mr. Nikal's argument, as quoted above. Here, as above, he appears to believe that Millward J.'s conception of the right and its <i>prima facie</i> infringement is an attempt to foreclose the justification branch of  <cite>Sparrow</cite>. But even if one could somehow interpret the appellant's factum to be proposing such a view, it is impossible to view Millward J.'s reasons in the same way. The oral decision from which Macfarlane J.A. quotes was a separate judgment concerned <i>solely</i> with the nature of the right, rendered several months before argument on justification was even heard.<sup><a href="#onethirtysix">136</a></sup> It is completely baffling, then, that Macfarlane J.A. could conclude
that Millward J. was suggesting that the Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en possessed an absolute right, because the commentary was expressly confined to the infringement, and had nothing to do with justification. Just as confusing is his own understanding of  &quot;<i>prima facie</i> infringement&quot; of an Aboriginal right.
<p>
The Supreme Court offered three preliminary questions to be considered: is the limitation on the right unreasonable?  does the limitation cause undue hardship to the Aboriginal people affected? does the limitation deny them their preferred method of exercising their right?  Based on Macfarlane J.A.'s outline of Mr. Nikal's claim, it is not clear whether his case relied on one of these questions in particular, or all three, or whether he advanced new questions for the Court to ask. In any case, Macfarlane J.A.'s treatment was very spare. In my discussion, I will focus on the
first question of `reasonableness,' with an eye to some of the problems I outlined above in my discussion of <cite>Sparrow</cite>. 
<p>
It is worth noting, however, that if Mr. Nikal <i>did</i> raise a concern of undue hardship in his defence, Macfarlane J.A. did not think much of it, dismissing the entire question with the remark that &quot;in most circumstances, it ought not to constitute an undue hardship.&quot;<sup><a href="#onethirtyseven">137</a></sup> Macfarlane J.A.'s treatment of this question indicates a problem coursing through every part of  <cite>Nikal</cite>: the majority judges have failed to examine Mr. Nikal's rights and his situation as a specific case, relying instead
on conclusions about licences in general, Aboriginal rights in general, and government action in general. His answer that it &quot;ought&quot; not to cause undue hardship most of the time is unsatisfactory.
<p>
The sum total of Macfarlane J.A.'s analysis of whether the licence denies to the Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en their preferred means of exercising their rights is his assertion that the licence requirement does not &quot;deny a right to  fish.&quot;<sup><a href="#onethirtyeight">138</a></sup> This observation is beyond doubt. It is also completely beside the point. No one in the case is suggesting that a licence requirement <i>denies</i> anyone the ability to fish; Mr. Nikal's objection is to the fact that in the present regulatory scheme, it is the regulation that <i>enables</i> him to fish legally. Mr. Nikal's claim is that being required to ask the DFO's permission before exercising the Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en right to fish denies the Band its preferred means of exercising this right. It seems self-evident that they would prefer to exercise their right under a regulatory regime that does not negate the very source of the right---the people, not the DFO.
<p>
After all this, it is hard to imagine that there is an aspect of Macfarlane J.A.'s decision in <cite>Nikal</cite> that is <i>less</i> understanding of  <cite>Sparrow</cite>'s meaning, but his treatment of the first question---&quot;is the limitation unreasonable?&quot;---shows that his decision has truly failed to appreciate it or attempt to resolve any
of its difficulties. As described above, the British Columbia Court of Appeal is not solely to blame for the confusion over this branch of the test; the Supreme Court's own choice of words is less than fortuitous. I have described the problem that arises if one considers the word `reasonable' in this branch of  <cite>Sparrow</cite> to
have the same meaning as &quot;reasonable limits&quot; under s. 1 of the <cite>Charter</cite>: the burden of proof becomes reversed and the plaintiff, instead of demonstrating the effect of the regulation on himself, must somehow demonstrate that the regulation is unreasonable on some global basis. 
<p>
In <cite>Nikal</cite>, there is every indication that this is exactly how Macfarlane J.A. interprets this word. The most vivid clue to this effect is his reference to the Ontario Court of Appeal's decision in <cite>Agawa</cite> and the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal's decision in <cite>Denny, Paul and Sylliboy v. The Queen</cite><sup><a href="#onethirtynine">139</a></sup> in support of his conclusion. In those cases, the Courts of Appeal determined that
because licensing serves a conservation purpose, it is `reasonable.'
<p>
It is not immediately obvious how cases about the inland fishery in Ontario and fishing on the Atlantic Coast are relevant to whether or not the British Columbia licensing system is `reasonable,' an obscurity that is compounded by the fact that <cite>Agawa</cite> deals with provincial, rather than federal, legislation, but it seems that Macfarlane J.A.\ is invoking these cases for their talismanic effect: they were approved by the Supreme Court in <cite>Sparrow</cite>. This assessment may seem cynical, but it is important to note that several cases, including <cite>R. v. Joseph and Underwood</cite>,<sup><a href="#oneforty">140</a></sup> <cite>R. v. Archie</cite>,<sup><a href="#onefortyone">141</a></sup> <cite>R. v. Joseph</cite>,<sup><a href="#onefortytwo">142</a></sup> <cite>R. v. Ellsworth</cite><sup><a href="#onefortythree">143</a></sup> and <cite>R. v. Bones</cite>,<sup><a href="#onefortyfour">144</a></sup> all of which (except for <cite>Joseph</cite>, which was decided in the Yukon Territory) were decided by British Columbia courts <i>after</i> <cite>Sparrow</cite>. These cases provided a wealth of different approaches to licences in British Columbia. Macfarlane J.A.'s failure to even consider these cases becomes all the more striking when one considers
exactly what was decided in the cases to which he does make reference, particularly <cite>Agawa</cite>.
<p>
The passages from these cases with which the Supreme Court agreed have nothing to do with licensing.<sup><a href="#onefortyfive">145</a></sup> Instead, the Court approved of <cite>Agawa</cite>'s treatment of the term &quot;existing,&quot; and of <cite>Dennym</cite>'s discussion of the appropriate priority to be accorded to Aboriginal fishing rights. Most importantly, both <cite>Agawa</cite> and <cite>DennyM</cite>, decided as they were before <cite>Sparrow</cite>, may have contributed in various ways to the `stringent' test enunciated in that case, but neither one of them actually applies it. Once <cite>Agawa</cite>, in particular, is viewed in this light, it is clear that when Macfarlane J.A. allows the Ontario Court of Appeal's view that s. 12(1) of the <cite>Ontario Fishery
Regulations</cite> &quot;constitutes a reasonable limitation on the Batchewana Band's treaty right to fish and, therefore, does not infringe s. 35(1) of the <cite>Constitution Act, 1982</cite>&quot;<sup><a href="#onefortysix">146</a></sup> to govern his own conclusions about the licence restriction imposed on Mr. Nikal, he is actually circumventing the <cite>Sparrow</cite> test altogether. 
<p>
In <cite>Agawa</cite>, the Court accepts the British Columbia Court of Appeal's decision in <cite>Sparrow</cite> entirely, including the `public interest' view of regulation that the Supreme Court expressly rejected in favour of the more stringent test of justification. The Supreme Court also adopted the priority list set out in <cite>Jack</cite> which the Ontario Court of Appeal, in the passage immediately following the one cited by Macfarlane J.A. in support of his view, <i>did not</i>.<sup><a href="#onefortyseven">147</a></sup> The end result of Macfarlane J.A.'s
treatment of <cite>Agawa</cite> and the term `reasonable' employed in that case is that he denies Mr. Nikal the benefit of the legal ground broken in <cite>Sparrow</cite> and subjects him, instead, to a form of the `public interest' test, in which not even the priority of the Aboriginal right to fish, much less the existence of a right to
self-regulate, is considered. This approach to Aboriginal rights, if it is not downright sneaky, cannot be said to be in keeping with <cite>Sparrow</cite>'s mandate that Aboriginal rights be taken seriously.
<p>
Macfarlane J.A.'s decision that licences do not even constitute a <i>prima facie</i> infringement of the Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en right to regulate their own fishing is highly problematic. Not only is it analytically unsound, it reflects poorly on the Court's understanding of Aboriginal rights in the following sense.
<p>
I have discussed earlier the mandate, in <cite>Sparrow</cite>, that a court be sensitive to the perspective of the Aboriginal person or people asserting a right when contemplating the content and scope of that right. It may seem self-evident to state that having regard for this perspective also requires the court to recognize the fact that
the rights have as their source the Aboriginal people asserting them, not an act of the state. This simple idea is embodied in Judson J.'s remarks about Aboriginal title, in <cite>Calder</cite>, when he said that &quot;it is clear that Indian title in British Columbia cannot owe its origin to the Proclamation of 1763, the fact is that when the
settlers came, the Indians were there, organized in societies and occupying the land as their forefathers had done for
centuries.&quot;<sup><a href="#onefortyeight">148</a></sup> Judson J. recognized this fact even as he rejected the argument that Aboriginal title still existed in British Columbia. It is astonishing, then, that the majority of British Columbia Court of Appeal, in the series of cases in which Judson J.'s conclusions about extinguishment are overturned, at the same time appears to ignore his observation about the source of Aboriginal rights.
<p>
The British Columbia fishing regulations in force at the time that Jerry Nikal was photographed gaff fishing on the Bulkley River subject both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people to the same licence requirement provided by s. 4(1) of the regulations: 
<blockquote>
Unless otherwise provided in the Act or in any Regulations made thereunder in respect of the fisheries to which these regulations apply or in the <cite>Wildlife Act (British Columbia)</cite>, no person shall fish except under the authority of a licence or permit issued thereunder.<sup><a href="#onefortynine">149</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The regulation establishes an absolute prohibition on fishing in the province, with exceptions provided for those who hold licences. Further, permission to fish is considered to flow from the authority of the licence itself. Through this mechanism, the state grants what is clearly classifiable as a fishing `privilege' to all fishers in British Columbia, in the same way that the province grants licences to motorists or to restaurants wishing to serve alcohol.
Section 27(1.1) of the regulations underlines the nature of the Indian food fishing licence, in particular, in even more dramatic terms: it provides that &uqot;<i>The Minister may</i> issue an Indian food fish licence to an Indian or a band for the sole purpose of obtaining food for that Indian and his family or for the band.&quot;<sup><a href="#onefifty">150</a></sup> [emphasis added.]
<p>
The licence, then, is not even considered to flow `as of right' from the Aboriginal right, so to speak; issuance is still at the discretion of the Minister in the same way that the Minister of Indian Affairs has the ability to disallow by-laws enacted under s. 81 of the <cite>Indian Act</cite>. When one views it in this light, the regulatory scheme established by the <cite>Fisheries Act</cite> does not sit comfortably with the concept of Aboriginal rights. Considering that the prohibition embodied in s. 4(1) has existed since at least 1888,<sup><a href="#onefiftyone">151</a></sup> a time long before Aboriginal rights were recognized in this province, this is not surprising. What is surprising, however, is that the majority judges in <cite>Nikal</cite> do not appear to turn their minds to this problem, accepting without much analysis that licences, in and of themselves, do not infringe the rights of the Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en.
<p>
Lambert J.A., on the other hand, flatly states that the Supreme Court did not resolve the issue of licences in <cite>Sparrow</cite>, writing that Mr. Nikal's 
<blockquote>
aboriginal right to fish is not dependent on holding a licence. Requiring him to hold a licence, is, in itself, an
interference with his right to fish. And photographing him while he is fishing and prosecuting him for the offence, indicates the severity of the interference.<sup><a href="#onefiftytwo">152</a></sup> 
</blockquote>
Lambert J.A.'s easy finding that there was a <i>prima facie</i> interference is, in my view, more in keeping with the low threshold which the Supreme Court must be taken to have established in <cite>Sparrow</cite>. Further, by spending so little time on determining whether the right was infringed, Lambert J.A. is able to devote more time to the `real' issue in this case, which is whether licences can be justified as infringements of Aboriginal rights and,
if so, why?  In broaching this subject, Lambert J.A. reflects the same approach to justification as did Mr. Nikal in his factum when he recognized the federal government's over-arching power to manage
the fishery:
<blockquote>
As we struggle towards a sensible solution in this difficult area, the final outcome, it seems to me, must incorporate a system of regulation of the fishery in order to ensure conservation and the continuance of the supply of fish both at sea and in the river. That system must be controlled, in my opinion, by one single organization with power to make decisions for the whole length of the river system, and at sea, so as to control conservation of the resource throughout the system. And that body should consult with all the users of the resource throughout the system to endeavour to secure a consensus and voluntary compliance with agreed or otherwise fairly determined conservation goals. Such a scheme may well require a form of licensing in order to ensure reporting and to enforce catch limitations and if it includes licensing for fishers in the ocean and in the lower reaches of the river it might well also require licensing for those engaging in the highest fishery on the river.<sup><a href="#onefiftythree">153</a></sup>
</blockquote>
While licensing may be necessary and reasonable to serve the goals of conservation, Lambert J.A. holds that because the licensing regime presently in place does not recognize the existence of Aboriginal rights in the first place, it is impossible that it could be considered to meet the standard of justification set out in <cite>Sparrow</cite>. Lambert J.A. points out that in 1986, when the Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en Chiefs began to refuse to apply for licences, they did so in a decidedly confrontational and negative atmosphere. The federal government refused to recognize any Aboriginal rights to fish, and later argued that the Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en's acceptance of
licences in the past constituted the implicit surrender of these rights. The Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en asserted such rights to fish and therefore refused to recognize the authority of the DFO.<sup><a href="#onefiftyfour">154</a></sup> This scheme, he says, cannot possibly be described as a regime that recognized Aboriginal rights to fish and it certainly could not give rise to any effective consultation. He concludes that the test of justification is not met.
<p>
The nature of Mr. Nikal's case forecloses discussion of the factors that <i>might</i> meet the test of justification. The majority judges determine that no justification is necessary because the right is not infringed, and Lambert J.A. holds that no justification is possible because of the nature of the regime that infringes the right. In <cite>Gladstone</cite>, however, there is discussion of justification, both from a majority judge---Hutcheon J.A.---and Lambert J.A., since they agree that the Gladstones' Aboriginal right was infringed. This decision will be the last one in this journey through the British Columbia Court of Appeal decisions, as it raises the issues of the final part in <cite>Sparrow</cite>---justification and the public fiduciary standard.
<p>
<i>B. Gladstone</i>
<p>
I have described earlier the treatment of the Gladstones' right by the majority judges, and my view that it is entirely out of keeping with <cite>Sparrow</cite>. Macfarlane J.A. concludes, however, that &quot;[a]lternatively, if there was a <i>prima facie</i> infringement of an aboriginal right it was justified,&quot;<sup><a href ="#onefiftyfive">155</a></sup> thus accepting Hutcheon J.A.'s justification analysis. This latter analysis is unfortunately no more satisfactory than Macfarlane J.A.'s treatment of the right. 
<p>
In order to understand why this is the case, it is important to recall the points made earlier about <cite>Sparrow</cite>'s institution of a public fiduciary standard for justification of infringements, and
the reasoning underlying this high standard. The Supreme Court held that the infringement of an Aboriginal right was a serious matter, and even though &quot;it does not promise immunity from government regulation in a society that, in the twentieth century, is increasingly more complex, interdependent and sophisticated, and where exhaustible resources need protection and management, it does hold the Crown to a substantive promise,&quot;<sup><a href="#onefiftysix">156</a></sup> and even though &quot;the justificatory standard to be met may place a heavy burden on the Crown,&quot;<sup><a href="#onefiftyseven">157</a></sup> the &quot;honour of the Crown is at stake in dealings with aboriginal peoples.&quot;<sup><a href="#onefiftyeight">158</a></sup> <cite>Gladstone</cite> provides us
with an opportunity to observe just how much the British Columbia Court of Appeal believes that honour is worth.
<p>
The two key aspects of justification that arise in <cite>Gladstone</cite> are the allocation of priorities in the herring spawn fishery, and whether the Heiltsuk people were consulted when the regulations were put in place.<sup><a href="#onefiftynine">159</a></sup> In considering these factors, it is worth recalling Lambert J.A.'s view in <cite>Nikal</cite> that any regulation put in place prior to the government's recognition of Aboriginal rights in British Columbia could not be in keeping with the honour of the Crown, because the regulations would be rooted in the notion that Aboriginal people fish at the permission of the Crown, not as of right. In <cite>Gladstone</cite>, Hutcheon J.A., who held in <cite>Nikal</cite> that <cite>Sparrow</cite> had already decided the issue of the validity of licensing in general,<sup><a href="#onesixty">160</a></sup> does not consider the Heiltsuk Band's licence, issued in 1988, to be unjustifiable solely because of when it was issued. Instead, he goes on to consider the questions the Supreme Court had set out. 
<p>
The appellants argued that the Heiltsuk had not been consulted when the licence was issued. In <cite>Sparrow</cite>, the Supreme Court did not outline what it thought `consultation' looked like, and therefore
does not give much guidance in this respect. Above, I have proposed what I believe to be a compelling reason for this duty of consultation: the DFO is holding the Heiltsuk Band's ability to act on its own behalf in regulating its fishing activities in `safekeeping' under the aegis of a fiduciary duty, until the Band's ability to represent itself is returned. The Crown's compromised position in this situation, as a fiduciary for the Heiltsuk who is nonetheless responsible for the interests of all users, gives rise to the requirement for the Crown to consult the Band and allow it to represent its own interests.
<p>
Hutcheon J.A.'s response to this requirement does not do much to further the understanding of why there is a duty of consultation, or of the nature of the Crown's responsibility toward the Heiltsuk interests. Instead, he simply concludes that &quot;in the application for the 1988 Category J licence, the Heiltsuk Band Council named a
representative to speak on its behalf. Consultation with that representative is sufficient to meet the requirement of consultation discussed in <cite>R. v. Sparrow</cite>.&quot;<sup><a href="#onesixtyone">161</a></sup> Nowhere in Hutcheon J.A.'s opinion is there any indication that this representative was actually consulted; he or she is not even named in his reasons. Additionally, the Category J licence does not permit the sale of the catch, which is the very issue of this case, so it is hard to see how the Heiltsuk's Aboriginal rights, especially concerning commerce, could have even been considered. Indeed, as alluded to above, if the Crown did not recognize any Aboriginal rights in 1988, it seems inconceivable that if the Heiltsuk representative had been consulted, the nature of the discussion would have had much to do with upholding the Heiltsuk's rights. Instead, the naming of a representative appears to be the routine filling-in of a blank, and Hutcheon J.A. does not discuss what the role of that person was intended to be even within the narrow scope of the existing regulations.
<p>
The honour of the Crown is no better upheld in Hutcheon J.A.'s discussion of the allocation of priorities in the spawn fishery. He refers to a meeting that took place at some undisclosed date, possibly in 1975 or 1976, in which all licence holders, of which the Heiltsuk were one, were brought together to &quot;discuss plans for those
holders.&quot;<a href="#onesixtytwo">162</a></sup> Again, there is no indication of whether the Heiltsuk were actually consulted; however, in this case, given that there was an actual meeting, it seems more likely. Hutcheon J.A., however, describes the attendees as 16 non-Aboriginal licence holders and 12 Aboriginal licence holders. It is worth asking what would have happened, in 1975 or 1976 (which even predated <cite>Jack</cite>), the Heiltsuk had claimed Aboriginal rights to the spawn fishery. Would anyone have listened to them?  Would the meeting have
simply collapsed in disarray?  Further, and perhaps this is more important, if this meeting could be considered `consultation' pursuant to <cite>Sparrow</cite>, it is difficult to see how the Crown's fiduciary duty to Aboriginal peoples could be met by treating Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal fishers in exactly the same fashion.
<p>
Finally, in dealing with the assertion that the allocation to the Heiltsuk Band was unjustifiable, Hutcheon J.A.\ refers to a letter that was sent to all licence holders, in which the plan for 1988 was set out. He quotes the part of the letter in which the allocations were tabled, and concludes that: 
<blockquote>
[a] fair inference from the evidence is that the allocation was made following consultation with the Category J licence holders including the representative of the Heiltsuk Band Council. In my opinion, the Crown met the burden of proof of justification at this stage and it was for the defence to show in what way the allocation
was improper.<sup><a href="#onesixtythree">163</a></sup>
</blockquote>
He adds that &quot;priority is always assured to the Indian people for food purposes,&quot; and then refers to the actual percentages of the herring-spawn fishery allocated to the Aboriginal fishers, noting that they are quite high.<sup><a href="#onesixtyfour">164</a></sup> This chain of reasoning merits several comments. First of all, in the above discussion of fiduciary principles under <cite>Sparrow</cite>, it is quite clear that it is the duty of the fiduciary to show the righteousness of his actions, not the duty of the beneficiary to demonstrate that they are improper. To suggest that because it may be &quot;fairly inferred&quot; from the evidence that there was consultation with the Heiltsuk the Crown has met its &quot;heavy burden&quot; is to ignore these principles, particularly when the only evidence Hutcheon J.A. provides for this inference is a numerical table that does not even
mention Aboriginal people's allocation.<sup><a href="#onesixtyfive">165</a></sup> Perhaps there was other evidence for his conclusion, but one might have expected, given the seriousness of the burden on the Crown, that he would have reproduced it in his opinion. Further, Hutcheon J.A. refers to the fact that priority is always given to Aboriginal people <i>for food purposes</i>, which, according to the terms of a Category J licence, does not permit sale of the catch. There is no discussion of whether the right of the Heiltsuk people to trade in herring spawn has been contemplated, and no discussion of where commercial rights might fit into the `priority list' established in <cite>Jack</cite> and accepted in <cite>Sparrow</cite>.<sup><a href="#onesixtysix">166</a></sup>
<p>
Instead of following the test of strict justification set out by <cite>Sparrow</cite>, it is my view that Hutcheon J.A. is simply applying a variation of the &quot;necessary and reasonable in the public interest&quot; test, which the Court of Appeal had earlier offered in <cite>Sparrow</cite>, which was rejected by the Supreme Court in that case,
but which was resurrected by Macfarlane J.A. in <cite>Nikal</cite>. 
<p>
He relies in large part on the fact that the allocations for Aboriginal fishers appear to be generous, quoting the percentages of the fishery to which they have access. By doing so, he appears to be suggesting that the allocation is reasonable and the Heiltsuk have nothing to complain about. Now, if the duty of consultation actually had been met, the allocation may have been no different: for all we know, the Heiltsuk may have received a smaller slice of the fishery. But in fiduciary law, process is everything, as is evidenced by the fact that the beneficiary need not show actual harm resulting from a breach. It is irrelevant, then, that the Heiltsuk's allocation seems generous. What <i>is</i> relevant is that the Heiltsuk  representatives, if they were consulted at all, were lumped in with
non-Aboriginal spawn fishers. The form of consultation accepted by the Court does not require the Crown to act in the Heiltsuk interest; the Crown's actions on the evidence provided by Hutcheon J.A. bespeak a `public interest' test. <cite>Sparrow</cite> demands a much higher standard. After enumerating the &quot;Crown's responsibility toward Aboriginal peoples&quot; as one of the considerations for the Court, Hutcheon J.A.'s failure to mention this responsibility even once, and the three concurring judges' failure to speak up about this is perhaps indicative of the British Columbia Court of Appeal majority's view of the value of Aboriginal rights. The Court has placed an extraordinarily low value on the &quot;honour of the Crown,&quot; and in doing so, similarly devalues the project of taking Aboriginal rights seriously.
<p>
Indeed, Hutcheon J.A.'s rather vapid treatment of the objective and justification in this case becomes all the more noticeable when one compares it to Lambert J.A.'s analysis, in which he finds that, on the evidence, even the <i>first</i> stage of justification was not met, holding that no conservation purpose was served by the licensing
system. At this point, Lambert J.A. appears to have tired of attacking his brothers' findings, and instead reviews different evidence altogether. He notes the evidence of an expert witness, who said that the licensing system served an allocation function more than a conservation function, and whose evidence was not challenged. Lambert J.A. concludes that: 
<blockquote>
in regulating the stock, there is no conservation imposed on the herring spawn on kelp fishery and no need for such conservation in the circumstances which existed in 1988. The conservation each year is entirely dealt with by regulating the 94% of the total of spawn and roe which are from fish that are netted and killed for their roe.<sup><a href="#onesixtyseven">167</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The only other possible reason for issuing licences, according to Lambert J.A., is for reporting purposes and, as he notes, a complete prohibition on the exercise of the Aboriginal right is an inappropriate means of serving this goal given that there is no conservation purpose underlying it.<sup><a href="#onesixtyeight">168</a></sup> In framing the issue this way, Lambert J.A. again underlines the majority judges' total failure to recognize the significance of a licensing system that requires Aboriginal people to get the government's permission to exercise rights that flow not from the government but from the people themselves. He thus shows the huge gap between <cite>Gladstone</cite> and the Court's initial promise in <cite>Delgamuukw</cite> to attempt to view the rights from the perspective of the Aboriginal people asserting them. The British Columbia Court of Appeal majority covered a lot of ground between these two cases, and much of this ground lay far behind what the Supreme Court had attempted to achieve in <cite>Sparrow</cite>. The Supreme Court will have, in my view, much work to do to set the contemplation of Aboriginal rights back on a meaningful level of discussion.
<p>
<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

Although the Supreme Court avoided discussion of licences and commercial fishing in <cite>Sparrow</cite>, at some point it will be called upon to evaluate issues such as those presented in the cases I have discussed in this article. These are hard questions. At the same time, the judges of the British Columbia Court of Appeal have
asserted, as have I, that various arguments or treatments of Aboriginal rights are &quot;not the course set by <cite>Sparrow</cite>.&quot; It will fall upon the Supreme Court, then, to clarify exactly what the course of <cite>Sparrow</cite> is. 
<p>
In this article, I have tried to point out some of the strong points and ambiguities that the Supreme Court opened up in <cite>Sparrow</cite>. In particular, the Court sought to invigorate Aboriginal rights as a legal concept by asking future courts to be sensitive to the perspective of the people holding them, rather than seeing the issues solely through a majoritarian lens. Second, the Court set out a strict test of justification, contemplating what I have referred to as a `public fiduciary standard.'  At the same time, the Court emphasized that the <cite>Sparrow</cite> analysis should not be applied mechanically to all following cases, thus challenging future courts to mould the analysis to particular cases to give real meaning to <cite>Sparrow</cite>'s promise that Aboriginal rights be taken seriously. In this sense, the Court set out a framework for contemplating Aboriginal rights, and challenged future courts to turn their minds to the difficult task of describing the rights in a fashion that is comprehensible in Canada's Anglo-European judicial system.
<p>
The majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal did not meet this challenge. By transforming the phrase &quot;integral to their distinctive culture&quot; into an incantation invoked without much thought, the majority turned analysis of Aboriginal rights back to the Eurocentric vision of `Indianness' expressed in <i>Four B</i>.
And by initiating a notion of Aboriginal rights that implies that their content is limited to that which is absent in non-Aboriginal culture, the Court sets s. 35(1) analysis on a dangerous course, potentially depriving Aboriginal rights of legal protection if they appear to diverge too far from their incarnations in &quot;Aboriginal times.&quot;  Further, the Court's view of what a <i>prima facie</i> infringement of, or a justifiable incursion on, an Aboriginal right looks like, as evidenced in <cite>Nikal</cite> and <cite>Gladstone</cite>, wanders drastically from the strict test set out in </cite>Sparrow</cite>. Viewing a name on an application form as sufficient to give meaning
to the Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en's historical power to govern themselves can hardly be said to be meeting the &quot;heavy burden on the Crown.&quot;
<p>
Lambert J.A.'s `social theory' of Aboriginal rights, on the other hand, constitutes a significant effort to take the rightholders' perspective as paramount and yet describe the right in a way that is comprehensible to Anglo-Canadian courts. I have suggested that the `social theory' has much in common with a theory of <cite>Charter</cite> rights: both Aboriginal and <cite>Charter</cite> rights are multi-layered and analysis will change depending on how deeply a Court plumbs into the content of the right. The <cite>Charter</cite> should in no way be determinative of rights-analysis under s. 35(1). But the Supreme Court's original conception of s. 35(1) in <cite>Sparrow</cite> owes a great deal to the early <cite>Charter</cite> analysis, and further contemplation of the meaning of <cite>Charter</cite> rights could aid the Court in returning s. 35(1) to the way set by <cite>Sparrow</cite>.
<p>
Whatever else the Court does, however, I think that it is imperative that it follow through on its promise to attempt to view Aboriginal rights from the perspective of the people who hold them, and to consider limitations on these rights from that same point of view, because to do otherwise would create an inexplicable disjuncture between s. 35(1) and other rights-affirming documents in Canada, once again treating Aboriginal people as `different' for no apparent reason. The decisions of the British Columbia Court of Appeal amply demonstrate that it is unsatisfactory to deny protection to asserted rights simply by identifying them as `different.'
<p>
Finally, given the controversy surrounding Aboriginal commercial fishing rights and licences in British Columbia, I underline that the Court will also have to hold itself strictly to its own view, in <cite>Sparrow</cite>, that a `public interest' justification is insufficient to justify a limit on constitutional rights. If such rights are found to exist, the proper course is to manage the claims of competing users of the fishery through consultation and negotiation. The proper course is not to sense impending controversy and solve the problem by denying that the rights exist in the first place. Such an approach would have too much in common with the `political rights' concept that the Court has already rejected. It would also utterly fail to uphold <cite>Sparrow</cite>'s promise that Aboriginal rights will be taken seriously.

regulations. He writes:
<blockquote>
I pause here to point out the obvious: namely, that every resident of British Columbia, native and non-native, has the
right to fish in British Columbian waters and dispose of their catch commercially. This right, however, is limited and controlled by a variety of regulations which require that the fishers hold licences permitting them to engage in commercial fishing. The regulations impose restrictions and controls respecting the place, time, method of fishing and quotas which limit the volume of fish caught by particular methods, and sold in the commercial market. <i>Ibid</i>. at 98.
</blockquote>
Not only is this conception of the fishery not obvious, it is plainly wrong, because under s. 4(1) of the <cite>British Columbia Fishery (General) Regulations</cite>, <i>supra</i> note 12, <i>no</i> non-Aboriginal British Columbian has the <i>right</i> to fish under the present regime: fishing is prohibited outright, and those who fish do so under a licence. Aboriginal people, however, may be able to prove a right to sell fish that is protected under s.
35(1). By suggesting that everyone has the <i>same</i> right to sell fish, and that this is merely restricted by the fishing regime, Wallace J.A. effectively dismisses s. 35(1)'s purpose of recognizing the uniqueness of Aboriginal rights.
<p>
It is perhaps worse, from the perspective of avoiding `frozen rights' thinking, that Wallace J.A. writes the majority opinion in <cite>NTC Smokehouse</cite>, and at the outset announces that what s. 35(1) protects is not the &quot;integral parts of their distinctive culture,&quot; but that which is &quot;integral to the Band's cultural and traditional way of life.&quot; <i>Supra</i> note 7 at 164.

Although Lambert J.A. does not explain why he finds this rationale so persuasive, he is implicitly recognizing the artificiality of separating `American Indian culture' from `Canadian Indian culture,' because the U.S.-Canadian border has nothing to do with Aboriginal culture itself. Wallace J.A., however, criticizes Lambert J.A.'s view, writing that:
<blockquote>
while harmony in the treatment of aboriginal rights on both sides of the border between Canada and the United States may be desirable---and I express no opinion in that regard---where the law of one jurisdiction is based on interpreting the United States Indian policy and resulting treaties from the nineteenth century, and the law of the other is based on determining the scope and nature of aboriginal rights recognized by the common law at sovereignty, such harmony may not be possible or even desirable. (at 101)
</blockquote>
Considering that Canadian law on Aboriginal issues is largely grounded in the Marshall trilogy (<cite>Fletcher v. Peck</cite>, 10 U.S. (6 Cranch) 87 (1810); <cite>Johnson v. M'Intosh</cite>, 21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) 543 (1823); <cite>Worcester v.

It goes without saying that this idea puts a very low value on Aboriginal rights and makes them inexplicably contingent and variable, as compared to <cite>Charter</cite> rights, for example. The assertion becomes all the more curious when one compares it to <cite>Van der Peet</cite>, in which the Court held that an Aboriginal right could not have arisen over the
twenty-five years between the arrival of the Hudson's Bay Company and the assertion of sovereignty over British Columbia. It is rather insulting that the Crown should have argued that while an Aboriginal right may not be gained in twenty-five years of `use,' it may be lost over nineteen years of `disuse.'  Specious as this argument is, however, it may be that Macfarlane J.A. accepted it, since in his view, the trade in spawn began in the 1970s.

He commented again on the illicit nature of the sale, saying that it was &quot;not dissimilar
to the manner in which criminals transport and sell narcotics.&quot; <i>Ibid</i>. at 141. These comments raise the question, in my view, of whether the reason Lemiski P.C.J. found that the Gladstones' activity was `different' from the activity evidenced by the historical record was because what they were doing was `illegal,' unlike the historical activity, which was above-board. Hutcheon J.A., quite properly, writes, <i>ibid.</i> at 141, that this is completely beside the point, because whether or not something is illegal today has nothing to do with the content of the right.

<blockquote>
[b]y evolution, the original scope and nature of the right is altered such that it can no longer be said to be an integral
component of the natives' traditional way of life or culture save in the most general sense, i.e. earning a livelihood. The absence of the requisite relationship between a traditional aboriginal practice and a present commercial activity is exemplified, for instance, by the remote connection between the aboriginal practice of gaming and the commercial operation of a gambling casino.<p>
In contrast, the modern manner of exercising a traditional right does not involve a distortion of the scope and nature of the aboriginal right; rather, it permits the right to remain, as it was at the time of sovereignty, an integral part of the native culture and traditional way of life. It is the manner of exercising the right which may take a contemporary form such as hunting, fishing, gathering and farming with modern equipment. <i>Supra</i>, note 5 at 156--7.

How Wallace J.A. can be so sure of what may be a &quot;distortion&quot; of an Aboriginal right, or that operating a gambling casino is unrelated to gaming, remains unexplained.

<h1>A Comparative Study of the Exclusionary Rule and Its Standing Threshold in Canada, the United States, and New York State: The Relation of Purpose to Practice

The author argues that the evidentiary exclusion rule should be firmly grounded in principles that coherently guide its development.  This rule is compared across three jurisdictions, revealing a complex interplay of purposes which define the boundaries of the rule: deterring police misconduct; remedying the violation of constitutional rights; maintaining judicial integrity; and maintaining the integrity of the justice system as a whole.  Problems in the development of the rule result from shifting views of its dominant purpose, and from the tensions between these views.  Case law within each jurisdiction exhibits this tension, but nevertheless is generally consistent with the accepted purpose of the rule.  The author suggests that differences between jurisdictions represent, in part, differences in their approaches to rights.
<p>
Contradictions remain, however, between the purpose and practice of the rule.  Primarily, the narrow rule of standing is inconsistent with the principles underlying the exclusionary rule, regardless of the accepted purpose.  The author advances a model to reconcile thresholds for standing with the purpose of the exclusionary rule.
Finally, the ambiguity as to which factors affect the fairness of the trial, and why, must be resolved, as these considerations play a central role in the development of the exclusionary rule in Canada.

<h3>I: Introduction</h3>

Comparative study of the treatment of illegally obtained evidence by courts in Canada, the United States, and New York reveals that each region has evolved quite distinct regimes in this respect, each with its own areas of contention. The exclusionary rule is defined very much in terms of its purpose and these jurisdictions present contrasting views of both the principles behind the rule and the process whereby exclusion of evidence is considered. Whereas the American jurisdictions employ a categorical exclusionary rule with various judge-made exceptions,<sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup> Canada has a more discretionary approach, requiring the Court to balance various factors before excluding evidence. <sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup> Four primary foundations for the rule have been put forward with varying degrees of acceptance over the years, including a) the need to deter police misconduct, b) the need for a remedy which is inferable from the constitutional guarantee of the right which was violated, c) judicial integrity, and d) the need to maintain the integrity of the justice system as a whole. Canadian and American approaches to the exclusionary rule differ significantly with respect to which of these underlying principles guides the rule.
<p>
Debate continues in both countries between those who favour a strong exclusionary rule and those who fear its impact on effective law enforcement.<sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup> Comparing and contrasting the evolution of case law in these three jurisdictions may point to worthy alternative approaches as well as to dangers that should be avoided. This comparison is particularly crucial for Canadian criminal procedure, which changed dramatically with the introduction of the <cite>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite> in 1982, and has begun in the last five years
to swing towards a more exclusionary rule. Certain criteria, if fulfilled, will now lead to nearly categorical exclusion, regardless of the balance of other factors. 
<p>
Any analysis of the American rule, however, must consider the differences between state and federal versions of the
exclusionary doctrines. Although this paper emphasizes the federal rule, New York provides an illuminating state perspective for two reasons. First, it is a major border state, hence it serves to emphasize certain fascinating cross-border differences, differences that persist despite a great cultural similarity on many levels. Second, due to its State Constitution, New York has departed from the federal interpretation of the exclusionary rule in some innovative
and significant ways. Indeed, some commentators, as discussed below, feel that state constitutions may be the last stronghold of an exclusionary rule which has been increasingly weakened at the federal level.
<p>
Many differences in the approach to an exclusionary rule relate to variations in the legal basis and purpose of the
exclusionary powers of the Court in each jurisdiction, and the relationship of the rule to the constitution. For example, the `categorical rule with exceptions' which characterizes American law reflects the absolute nature of many American constitutional rights, whereas the balancing approach used by Canadian courts is consistent
with constitutional recognition that <cite>Charter</cite> rights are not absolute. Other differences relate to the distinct evolution of the common law regarding illegally obtained evidence in Canada as compared to the United States.<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup> The guiding constitutional law or common law is often ambiguous, however, and
some distinctions may be related as much to v ariations in public and judicial opinion as to jurisdictional differences. 
<p>
Of all aspects of the exclusionary rule, the one most in need of reform (in all three jurisdictions) is standing law, the
threshold one must pass before a Court will consider an application on its merits. The effect of the exclusionary rule depends in large part on its breadth, with the rule's impact weakened by limiting the situations in which violations are found to have occurred, or by limiting standing to invoke the rule. Comparison of these three jurisdictions indicates a surprising degree of similarity regarding `standing', an area of the law that actually raises some of the
greatest contradictions between purpose and practice. This contradiction is especially important in Canada because the Supreme Court has yet to rule directly on this issue. That Court has the chance to avoid entrenching a standing threshold that is inconsistent with the substantive purpose of the exclusionary rule, and with this fact in mind, I shall present a model of standing law which reconciles the principle, or principles, behind the rule with the standing threshold itself. Defining the ideal boundaries of the exclusionary rule raises complex issues which shall be addressed in detail, but only after first reviewing the basis for exclusionary powers, the expressed purpose of those powers, and finally the general criteria considered in each jurisdiction before excluding illegally obtained evidence. Finally, some alternatives to the exclusionary rule will be briefly discussed.
<p>
<h3>II: The Basis and Purpose of Exclusionary Powers</h3>

UNITED STATES (FEDERAL)
<p>
In federal courts, the exclusionary rule has a long and varied history,<sup><a href =  "#five">5</a></sup> with several justifications for its existence appearing over time. The Supreme Court in recent years has consistently approved only one of these justifications, that being its role as a general deterrent against Fourth Amendment violations. In <cite>Mapp v. Ohio</cite>,<sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup> the first case to apply the federal exclusionary rule to state jurisdictions, the majority of the Court was divided in its reasoning as to why the exclusionary rule applied. The majority judgment grounded the power in the Constitution as a remedy necessarily implied to give substance to the
rights.
<blockquote>
This court has ever since required of federal law officers a strict adherence to that command which this court has held to be a clear, specific, and constitutionally required---even if judicially implied---deterrent safeguard without insistence upon which the Fourth Amendment would have been reduced to `a form of words.'<sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution (1791) reads:
<blockquote>
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.
</blockquote>
In addition to the implied remedy argument, some commentators<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup> describe <cite>Mapp</cite> as saying that the power to exclude is rooted in a need for the &quot;judicial integrity so necessary in the true administration of justice.&quot;<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup> Akin to the language in the Canadian <cite>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite>, Justice Clark's judgment seems to suggest that excluding
illegally obtained evidence is necessary to preserve the integrity of the justice system, from the level of the individual to the level of the Court itself.
<p>
Unfortunately, these two arguments were not supported by a complete majority of justices<sup><a href="#ten">10</a></sup> or by later decisions of the Supreme Court, leaving a third major argument as the sole survivor---the deterrence incentive. Recent decisions have gone as far as to state that the exclusionary rule is &quot;a <i>judicially created</i> remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved.&quot;<sup><a href="#eleven">11</a></sup> This move away from a clear grounding in the Constitution has caused considerable debate; in the absence of a constitutional foundation, the exclusionary rule can no longer be applied to states (which would have to devise their own statutory or constitutionally-derived rules). Some critics believe that by &quot;basing exclusion solely upon deterrence (and not seriously considering judicial and governmental integrity), the Court has dismantled the rule.&quot;<sup><a href="#twelve">12</a></sup>
<p>
At the moment, the dominant and possibly sole purpose of the exclusionary rule is general deterrence of future constitutional violations. Protection of personal rights plays no role in exclusions. As we shall see, this characterization of the purpose leads to a much more limited exclusionary rule than in either of the following two jurisdictions.
<p>
NEW YORK STATE
<p>
As noted above, the United States Constitution serves as the ground for extending the federal exclusionary rule to New York State, but state courts are free to implement their own version of the exclusionary rule, which in some areas is stricter than the federal rule. In fact, the jurisprudence is not entirely clear as to how far the State Constitution protects individual rights by exclusion. State courts tend to interpret state constitutional provisions resembling federal constitutional provisions along lines following federal decisions, although they can develop their own independent reasoning if they wish.<sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup> Some commentators have urged such independent rule-making in light of the weak federal position regarding exclusion of illegally obtained evidence.<sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup> In New York, early jurisprudence on exclusion rejected such a rule at common law, claiming that the State Constitution, once it had been introduced, did not change the common law.<sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup> Until forced to follow <cite>Mapp v. Ohio</cite>, the New York Court was historically reluctant to exclude evidence at all, and as recently as 1982 in <cite>People</cite> v. </cite>Young</cite>, the Court expressly stated that the &quot;underlying purpose of the exclusionary rule is not to redress the injury to the accused's privacy for that privacy once invaded, may never be restored. Rather, the rule's
primary objective is to deter future unlawful police conduct and thereby effectuate the Fourth Amendment's proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup>
<p>
<cite>People v. Johnson</cite> is perhaps the closest the Court has come to suggesting that exclusion may be a personal remedy for the violation of individual rights, but a more accurate reading is that the Court was merely echoing the federal view that exclusion protects rights generally by deterrence of future misconduct. As
noted in <cite>Johnson</cite>:
<blockquote>
the proscription against unlawful searches and seizures contained in N.Y. Constitution, article 1, S 12 conforms with that found in the 4th Amendment, and ... this identity of language supports a policy of uniformity between State and Federal courts ... Certainly, when the Supreme Court has not addressed a specific issue or provided guidance for such an analysis in its 4th Amendment rulings, we may, as we have in the past, choose to judge the lawfulness of the police conduct by the standards of our State Constitution ... [in this appeal,] the aims of predictability and precision in judicial review of search and seizure cases and <i>the protection of the individual rights of our citizens</i> are best promoted by applying State constitutional standards.<sup><a href ="#seventeen">17</a></sup>
</blockquote>
This reliance on the State Constitution, with its aspect of individual rights protection, has enabled New York to maintain an exclusionary rule with fewer exceptions<sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup> than the federal rule, which denies the existence of any personal rights guarantee under the Fourth Amendment.<sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a></sup> 
<p>
Although the exclusionary rule has not been elevated yet to a personal remedy for rights violations, the emphasis on protecting individual rights has definitely lead to stricter enforcement of the rule. In <cite>Bigelow</cite> and <cite>Johnson</cite>, the New York courts have added individual protection of rights as another <i>factor</i> to be considered, in addition to deterrence, when deciding if an exception to the rule is warranted. Such a factor only makes sense, however, if there is a constitutional basis for it. Whether the Court moves to the next logical step, expressly recognizing a personal remedy as a necessary implication of the constitutional rights, remains to be
seen.
<p>
CANADA
<p>
Canada, prior to the introduction of the <cite>Charter</cite>, there was very limited common law power to exclude illegally obtained evidence. In the <cite>Queen v. Wray</cite>, Martland J. held that apart from a limited discretion to exclude evidence where it would operate unfairly against the accused, &quot;the function of the court is to determine the issue before it, on the evidence admissible in law, and it does not extend to the exclusion of admissible evidence for any other reason.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty">20</a></sup> Just before
the advent of the <cite>Charter</cite>, the Supreme Court in <cite>Rothman v. The Queen</cite><sup><a href = #twenty1">21</a></sup> first considered the possibility that police actions bringing &quot;the administration of
justice into disrepute&quot; might justify exclusion of evidence. Lamer J. (as he then was, concurring with the majority for different reasons) and Estey J. (dissenting with Laskin C.J.)  proposed such tests<sup><a href="#twenty2">22</a></sup> but the majority of the Court followed the common law as established in <cite>Ibrahim v. The King</cite>.<sup><a href="#twenty3">23</a></sup> It was the <cite>Charter</cite> that opened the door on
more profound changes.
<p>
One of the primary differences between the American and Canadian jurisdictions is that the Canadian Constitution <i>expressly</i> allows a court to exclude evidence obtained in violation of <cite>Charter</cite> rights. In <cite>R</cite>. v. <cite>Therens</cite>,<sup><a href="#twenty4">24</a></sup> the Supreme Court concluded that evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2) rather than s. 24(1),<sup><a href="#twenty5">25</a></sup> a finding
later confirmed in <cite>R</cite>. v. <cite>Collins</cite>, the case which set the foundation for the Canadian exclusionary rule. Despite this clear constitutional basis for its exclusionary power, the Canadian Court has been criticized both for taking liberties with the text to expand the rule, and for not going far enough in applying the rule in some areas.<sup><a href="#twenty6">26</a></sup>
<p>
The Supreme Court of Canada adopted a view of the purpose of the exclusionary rule which, on its face, is radically different from that adopted by the United States Supreme Court. Acting with knowledge of the American situation, the Court in <cite>Collins</cite> held that:
<blockquote>
It is whether the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute that is the applicable test. Misconduct by the police in the investigatory process often has some effect on the repute of the administration of justice, but s. 24(2) is not a remedy for police misconduct, requiring the exclusion of
evidence if, because of this misconduct, the administration of justice was brought into disrepute. Section 24(2) could well have been drafted in that way, but it was not. Rather, the drafts of the <cite>Charter</cite> decided to focus on the admission of the evidence in the proceedings, and the purpose of s. 24(2) is to prevent having the
administration of justice brought into further disrepute by the admission of the evidence in the proceedings. This further disrepute will result from the admission of evidence that would deprive the accused of a fair hearing, or from judicial condonation of unacceptable conduct by the investigatory and prosecutorial agencies. It will also be necessary to consider any disrepute that may result from the exclusion of the evidence. It would be inconsistent with the purpose of s. 24(2) to exclude evidence if its exclusion would bring the administration of justice into greater disrepute than would its admission. Finally, it must be emphasized that even though the inquiry under s. 24(2) will necessarily focus on the specific prosecution, it is the long-term consequences of regular admission or
exclusion of this type of evidence on the repute of the administration of justice which must be considered.<sup><a href="#twenty7</a>27</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Exclusion of evidence as a deterrent against police misconduct seems to be ruled out by the initial words of this
passage, but a deterrence dimension to the rule was clearly retained in the final words. Nevertheless, Canadian courts are primarily required to look at the disrepute arising from the use of any evidence in each particular trial, a principle of judicial, or justice system, integrity. The remedy of exclusion is also, to some extent, a personal constitutional right <i>if</i> the appropriate criteria are met (in the view of the Court), thus differing from the
U.S. position.
<p>
The decision in <cite>Collins</cite> is guided by the text of s. 24(2), and in part perhaps by learning from the difficulties encountered with the rule in its long history in American courts. By avoiding reliance on a deterrence argument, the Court has given the rule both stability and flexibility; crucial evidence may be admitted where necessary, even if investigatory violations deserve to be punished. 
<p>
The interpretation of s. 24(2) also demonstrates elements of judicial creativity. The requirement of &quot;further disrepute&quot;, which minimizes the role of exclusion as `punishment' for police misconduct, is not derived from the text of s. 24(2), for example, nor does the idea that evidence should be admitted if its exclusion would bring further disrepute. A final point of interest is that Justice Lamer's equation of &quot;judicial condonation of unacceptable conduct&quot; with &quot;disrepute&quot; evokes Justice Clark's discussion of  &quot;judicial integrity&quot; as the basis (now rejected) for the American rule in <cite>Mapp v. Ohio</cite>.
<p>
The Canadian view of the exclusionary rule's purpose, then, is more flexible than that of the United States federal system, and somewhat more flexible than the New York view. It is not limited to certain delineated exceptions. Whether it is actually more or less exclusionary is hard to say without a very broad-based empirical study of cases involving suppression issues. How the difference in principles plays out in the characterization of the rule in practice will now be examined in some detail. 
<p>
<h3>III: Characterization of the Exclusionary Rule</h3>

UNITED STATES (FEDERAL)
<p>
The federal exclusionary rule can be described as generally mandating exclusion if there has been a violation of the
Constitution, unless the situation fits within a number of judicially-approved exceptions. Any evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, or Sixth Amendments is to be excluded, but as Justice Holmes stated in <cite>Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States</cite>, &quot;this does not mean that the facts thus obtained become sacred and inaccessible.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty8">28</a></sup> In fact, the Supreme Court has outlined a number of circumstances that justify admission of evidence despite violations. 
<p>
Evidence derived from illegal conduct, if classified as the &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot; (that is, causally connected to the violation), will also be excluded. The test for this exclusion is outlined in <cite>Segura v. United States</cite>.<sup><a href="#twenty9">29</a></sup> If the evidence would not have been discovered, &quot;but for&quot; the illegality, it may be excluded, though not necessarily so if the circumstances come under one of the exceptions.
<p>
Rather than concentrate solely on the known exceptions, however, one should consider the underlying rationales as well, because only a few important ones account for most of the exceptions to the exclusionary rule, and will lead to the most crucial future developments in the law. These rationales include:
<ol>
<li>Evidence will only be excluded to the extent that the exclusion leaves the police (and the defendant) &quot;in the same, not a <i>worse</i>, position than they would have been in if no police error or misconduct had occurred.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty">30</a></sup> This reasoning lies behind<br>
a) the independent source doctrine;<sup><a href="#thirty1">31</a></sup><br>
b) the inevitable discovery doctrine;<sup><a href="#thirty2">32</a></sup> and to some extent,<br>
c) the attenuation of causal connection doctrine;<sup><a href="#thirty3">33</a></sup> and,
<p>
<li>Evidence will not be excluded if the general deterrence effect on future constitutional violations is outweighed by the social cost of excluding undeniably probative evidence.<sup><a href="#thirty4">34</a></sup> If deterrence will have no effect on a similar fact situation in the future, the evidence will likely be admitted.<sup><a href ="#thirty5">35</a></sup> This rationale forms the basis of:<br>
d) the good faith exception.<sup><a href="#thirty6">36</a></sup><br>
It can also be extended to cover cases where deterrence of police action would be an undesirable result, as in the case of:<br>
e) the emergency/exigent circumstances exception.<sup><a href="#thirty7">37</a></sup>
</ol>
Balancing of various factors can occur in the federal exclusionary rule, depending on the context, but the factors to be valued and balanced are primarily the benefit of deterring police misconduct and negligence, the social cost of exclusion (given great emphasis in many cases), and to some extent, the effect on the trial (if a harmless effect, no change will be made).<sup><a href="#thirty8">38</a></sup> The balance is guided by the rationales listed above, and as will be demonstrated, is potentially much narrower in scope than the balance in New York and Canada. In addition, the federal rule may give much higher weight to the social cost of exclusion<sup><a href="#thirty9">39</a></sup> than the rule in Canada, at least on the surface.<sup><a href="#forty">40</a></sup> Before moving on to discuss the exclusionary rule in
other jurisdictions, however, the five main exceptions listed above will be briefly reviewed.
<p>
a) <i>The Independent Source Doctrine</i>:
<br>
This doctrine was first defined in <cite>Silverthorne Lumber Co.</cite>, when Justice Holmes stated that if &quot;knowledge of [facts gained by illegal means] is gained by an independent source they may be proved like any others, but the knowledge gained by the Government's own wrong cannot be used by it in the way
proposed.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty1">41</a></sup> Recent cases like <cite>Nix v. Williams</cite> and <cite>Murray v. United States</cite> indicate that the Court will not allow agents of the government to place themselves in a better situation by illegally obtaining evidence, but neither will courts place them in a worse situation than they would have been in absent the illegality.<sup><a href="#forty2">42</a></sup> In <cite>Murray</cite>, the leading case on independent source doctrine, a warrant for a search was obtained following the illegal entry of a warehouse. In the initial search, the warehouse was found to contain bales of marijuana, but the police did not use
or rely on the evidence from the illegal search in obtaining the warrant.<sup><a href="#forty3">43</a></sup>  Under the
circumstances, the Supreme Court held that the evidence from a second search (with the warrant) was obtained <i>independent</i> of the original illegality.<sup><a href="#forty4">44</a></sup> Even if the warrant was based in part on illegally obtained evidence, the Court would still uphold the warrant if it could have been validly issued in any case on the basis of the remaining untainted evidence.<sup><a href="#forty5">45</a></sup>
<p>
b) <i>The Inevitable Discovery Doctrine</i>:
<br>
Similar to the doctrine above, if illegally obtained evidence would have been discovered regardless, to exclude it would place the police in a worse position than they would have been in absent the illegality. The courts refuse to punish police in this way.<sup><a href="#forty6">46</a></sup> Instead, if police can &quot;establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the information ultimately or inevitably would have been discovered by lawful means ... then the deterrence rationale has so little basis that the evidence should be received.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty7">47</a></sup> The police need not even prove an absence of bad faith, because the Supreme Court felt that this would risk placing the police in a worse situation than that in which they would have been.<sup><a href="#forty8">48</a></sup> In practice, the burden of proving inevitable discovery may be quite low since courts have routinely accepted that certain procedures such as proper searches would have been used in due course.<sup><a href="#forty9">49</a></sup>
<p>
The difficulty with the inevitable discovery doctrine, permissible under the &quot;no worse position&quot; rationale, is that it is really an oracular fiction---although there is <i>definitely</i> police misconduct, there need only be a &quot;preponderance of evidence&quot; that discovery would have resulted in any case. To admit evidence in such cases may excuse &quot;bad faith&quot; by failing to consider it as a factor at all. As long as the inevitable discovery doctrine is retained, it seems that the first rationale cited above takes precedence over the second. This doctrine also impacts indirectly on the second rationale by reducing the deterrent force of the exclusionary rule generally, making it more likely that evidence will also be admitted under that rationale in the future.
<p>
c) <i>Attenuation of Causal Connection</i>:
<br>
According to the Court in <cite>Wong Sun</cite>, if the evidence was obtained in a manner that was sufficiently distinguishable from the illegality as to be &quot;purged of the primary taint&quot; (i.e. the causal connection was broken), it will be admissible.<sup><a href="#fifty">50</a></sup> Determining whether the causal chain has been broken will vary on a case by case basis but three factors should certainly be considered.<sup><a href="#fifty1">51</a></sup> These include: (a) the\break temporal proximity of the illegality and the evidence;<sup><a href="#fifty2">52</a></sup> (b) the  resence of intervening circumstances;<sup><a href="#fifty3">53</a></sup> and particularly (c) the &quot;purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty4">54</a></sup>
<p>
d) <i>The Good Faith Exception</i>:
<br>
The basis of this exception is that no deterrent value will result from excluding evidence if officers were relying in good faith upon a warrant,<sup><a href="#fifty5">55</a></sup> or operating under a law<sup><a href="#fifty6">56</a></sup> which they honestly believed to be valid at the time. Similarly situated officers in the future, unaware that they were operating under a false assumption, would not be deterred from acting. In <cite>United States v. Leon</cite>, the Supreme Court held that officers acting under a facially valid warrant were acting in good faith and that the evidence they obtained should not be excluded.<sup><a href="#fifty7">57</a></sup>
<p>
The Court in <cite>Leon</cite> opened up a large possible exception with this ruling, but also set up certain safeguards that must be observed before deference to the magistrate's warrant is acceptable. As we shall see in the discussion of Canadian jurisprudence, good faith on the part of police is one of the most common justifications put forward by the prosecution to remove the taint from evidence. The <cite>Leon</cite> ruling set four limits on when a warrant will be objectively reasonable (in light of the fact that probable cause is normally evaluated using a totality of the circumstances test).<sup><a href="#fifty8">58</a></sup> Deference to the magistrate's decision will not be given if (a) the warrant was based on the knowing or reckless falsity of an affidavit;<sup><a href="#fifty9">59</a></sup> (b) the magistrate was not &quot;neutral and detached;&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty">60</a></sup> (c) there was no substantial basis for determining the existence of probable cause under the totality of circumstances;<sup><a href="#sixty1">61</a></sup> or (d) there was no objectively valid reason for the officers to believe the warrant was facially valid.<sup><a href="#sixty2">62</a></sup> Whether these safeguards will be sufficient to maintain the deterrent force of the exclusionary rule, however, is questionable.<sup><a href="#sixty3">63</a></sup>
<p>
e) <i>Emergency/Exigent Circumstances</i>:
<br>
In <cite>U.S. v. Chadwick</cite>, the Court recognized certain exigent circumstances as exceptions to the exclusionary rule. These circumstances include danger to the public or the officers, as well as a need to preserve evidence in danger of imminent removal or destruction.<sup><a href="#sixty4">64</a></sup> The presence of such factors is defined largely by the context.<sup><a href="#sixty5">65</a></sup>
<p>
Many of the concepts discussed above have their counterparts in New York State law, but as the following discussion will show, there are significant differences, most of which can be traced back to a desire to provide greater protection for constitutional rights in New York State.
<p>
NEW YORK STATE
<p>
Many of the principles of state law mirror developments in the federal exclusionary rule, but in several cases New York has enforced a stricter version of the rule. The underlying rationales behind New York's exceptions to the general rule defined in <cite>Mapp v. Ohio</cite> differ somewhat from federal rationales. The
first rationale listed above is unchanged, but after <cite>People v. Johnson</cite> and <cite>People v. Bigelow</cite>, the second rationale should be rephrased. In New York, evidence will only be excluded if the benefit obtained by deterring state misconduct <i>and protecting individual  rights</i><sup><a href="#sixty6">66</a></sup> offsets the social cost of excluding relevant evidence. Other factors such as judicial integrity and abusiveness of police misconduct have also been mentioned by New York courts, though with
less frequency.<sup><a href="#sixty7">67</a></sup>
<p>
How much weight the state courts will give to the factor of individual rights protection remains uncertain at this time. At one end of the spectrum is the federal rule, which presently views general deterrence as the only relevant means of protecting rights. At the other end is the view that any infringement of a personal right requires a punitive exclusionary remedy. New York, like Canada, occupies a middle position, and as yet, courts in New York have not given clear weight to this factor. Two main choices face the Court, either (a) a rule that excludes illegally obtained
evidence in <i>all</i> cases, except when it would put the state in a <i>worse</i> position than it would have been in if not for the error (a categorical version of rationale number one, above; this direction may be the one taken in <cite>Bigelow</cite> when the Court rejected <cite>Leon</cite>), or (b) a rule that emphasizes rationale number two, above, and balances various factors even if it does put the police in a worse position (as in Canada). The implications of such shifts for each of the major federal exceptions should be reviewed.
<p>
<cite>People v. Knapp</cite><sup><a href="#sixty8">68</a></sup> established a &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot; doctrine in New York, and exceptions similar to federal ones have followed.
<p>
a) <i>The Independent Source Doctrine</i>:
<br>
The doctrine in New York mirrors that in the federal jurisdiction and does not appear to be affected by <cite>Bigelow</cite> and <cite>Johnson</cite>, unless the Court decides to give priority to the balancing (second) rationale rather than to the &quot;no worse position&quot; (first) rationale.<sup><a href="#sixty9">69</a></sup>
<p>
b) <i>The Inevitable Discovery Doctrine</i>:
<br>
In <cite>People v. Acevedo</cite>,<sup><a href="#seventy">70</a></sup> the Court followed <cite>Nix v. Williams</cite> in adopting the federal position on inevitable discovery.<sup><a href="#seventy1">71</a></sup> The Court may even have effectively <i>lowered</i> the burden of proof required to establish inevitability of discovery. A warrant was issued for a search between six a.m. and nine p.m., but the search occurred at 4:15 a.m.; the Court said no evidence suggested there would have been any change in circumstance between 4:15 and the proper time for legal use of the warrant (six a.m.), therefore search products were admitted. This phrasing seems less onerous than the need for a preponderance of evidence required in <cite>Nix</cite>. More disturbing, if it were truly &quot;inevitable&quot; that there would have been no change in circumstances, why did the officers feel the need to begin two hours early when they had a valid warrant for six a.m.?
<p>
The possibility that the second rationale (balancing of factors) may take precedence over the first rationale (&quot;no worse position&quot;) appears in a recent case. <cite>People v. Brandon</cite><sup><a href="#seventy2">72</a></sup> suggests there is authority for refusing to apply the inevitable discovery doctrine to evidence obtained directly, as opposed to indirectly, from the illegality. Such reasoning might have resulted in a different holding in <cite>Acevedo</cite>.
<p>
c) <i>Attenuation of Causal Connection</i>:
<br>
The test in New York, developed in <cite>People v. Martinez</cite>,<sup><a href="#seventy3">73</a></sup> generally follows the federal position established in <cite>Brown v. Illinois</cite> and has not
been affected by the changes noted above.<sup><a href="#seventy4">74</a></sup> Nevertheless, an indication of interpretive differences between the state and federal method of applying the test can be seen in <cite>New York v. Harris</cite>.<sup><a href="#seventy5">75</a></sup> With probable cause related to a murder, police entered the accused's apartment without a warrant, gave him <cite>Miranda</cite> warnings and began an interrogation resulting in an admission of guilt. This entry of the home was held to be unconstitutional<sup><a href="#seventy6">76</a></sup> (evidence gathered at the home was suppressed as the fruit of illegality). After transfer to the precinct, a second interrogation occurred one hour later (after a second <cite>Miranda</cite> warning) in which the defendant again admitted guilt.<sup><a href="#seventy7">77</a></sup> The New York Court of Appeals found that the short time between the illegality and the second statement was insufficient attenuation. The statement was deemed the &quot;fruit&quot; of the illegal entry. At the Supreme Court, however, the decision was reversed in a five to four decision (Marshall, Brennan, Blackmun and Stevens, JJ. dissenting). The Supreme Court majority placed weight on the fact that probable cause to detain the suspect existed, therefore the interrogation at the precinct was inevitable anyway;<sup><a href="#seventy8">78</a></sup> it held that the constitutional <cite>Payton</cite> violation ended when the suspect was removed from the site of the illegal entry. In addition, the Court indicated that enough deterrence was gained by excluding all evidence seized at the home, rendering further exclusions unnecessary.<sup><a href="#seventy9">79</a></sup> The dissent rejected the home/precinct distinction and insisted on applying the three
factors set out in <cite>Brown</cite>, reaching the same conclusion as the Court of Appeals, that the second confession was not sufficiently attenuated.<sup><a href="#eighty">80</a></sup> The Supreme Court decision implies that the statement could have been obtained legally in any case (the first rationale), whereas the New York Court of Appeals applied a stricter rule, concentrating on whether the events in the home produced the fruit of the second confession.
<p>
d) <i>Good Faith Exception</i>:
<br>
Relying on the State Constitution, New York courts have rejected applying <cite>Leon</cite>'s good faith exception both to searches without a warrant<sup><a href="#eighty1">81</a></sup> and searches with a warrant believed valid.<sup><a href="#eighty2">82</a></sup> The Court in <cite>Johnson</cite> rejected the federal test of probable
cause, defined in <cite>Illinois v. Gates</cite><sup><a href="#eighty3">83</a></sup> as sufficient cause under the &quot;totality of circumstances.&quot;  Instead, the more rigorous two-pronged test of the <cite>Aguilar-Spinelli</cite> rule was retained as the standard.<sup><a href="#eighty4">84</a></sup> The alternative of a good faith exception was expressly rejected &quot;as a matter of State constitutional law&quot; in <cite>Bigelow</cite>.<sup><a href="#eighty5">85</a></sup>
<p>
It appears that New York State courts are considering more than just the deterrent effect in making suppression decisions. Unfortunately, the cases to date have not made it entirely clear what other factors are considered and what weight they should be given. A clear statement of the rule is lacking.
<p>
e) <i>The Emergency/Exigent Circumstances Doctrine</i>:
<br>
As with the federal doctrine, there are general principles which justify warrantless searches in cases where an officer
&quot;reasonably perceives that [an] emergency situation exists,&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty6">86</a></sup> so long as the search is related in time and extent to the circumstances validating the arrest.<sup><a href="#eighty7">87</a></sup>
Justifications for this exception include securing the safety of the public<sup><a href="#eighty8">88</a></sup> and the officer (hence its relevance to search incident to arrest),<sup><a href="#eighty9">89</a></sup> and protection of evidence from destruction or concealment (hence its extension to mobile items such as automobiles and their  contents).<sup><a href="#ninety">90</a></sup> One specialized branch of the exception is referred to specifically as the `automobile exception.'<sup><a href="#ninety1">91</a></sup>
<p>
Having seen that New York's exclusionary rule seems to have given a greater role than the federal rule to factors other than deterrence, an examination of the Canadian rule is in order.
<p>
CANADA
<p>
The Supreme Court of Canada, in <cite>Collins</cite>, outlined a set of relevant factors to be considered and balanced during exclusion motions, no single factor initially being held sufficient on its own to grant admission or exclusion.<sup><a href="#ninety2">92</a></sup> Unlike in the United States, even after evidence is shown to be illegally obtained, the onus is on the accused to show that admission of the evidence will bring the administration of justice into disrepute.<sup><a href="#ninety3">93</a></sup> Defining disrepute &quot;requires the judge to refer to what he conceives to be the views of the community at large,&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety4">94</a></sup> though only in an abstract sense (and only when that community's mood is reasonable), guided by the factors set out in <cite>Collins</cite>. Three main classes of factors were specified by Lamer J. (as he then was)---those relating to:<sup><a href="#ninety5">95</a></sup>
<blockquote>
a) the fairness of the trial; <br>
b) the seriousness of the <cite>Charter</cite> violation; and <br>
c) the effect of excluding the evidence.
</blockquote>
Significantly, in Canadian law, there is no underlying rationale limiting exclusion if it would &quot;put the police in a worse position.&quot;  Instead, any piece of evidence could theoretically be excluded if the balance of factors weighs against it. As a result, judges in Canada have greater flexibility in dealing with the factual circumstances of each case than their American counterparts. On a positive note, balancing allows judges to be more sensitive to the
different weights given to factors such as the probative value of and need for evidence in different contexts. On a negative note, such a broad discretionary range may be a licence to make case law that is based primarily on the facts of each case and not on coherent principles. The latter problem is most apparent in search and seizure cases when the evidence to be excluded is generally both highly probative and necessary for a conviction. Sympathies will not often lie with the accused in such cases, particularly if serious crimes are involved. Rights protection may take second place behind crime control.
<p>
Despite this apparent difference between the United States and Canada, there are actually many similarities between the factors balanced in Canada and the factors and exceptions considered in the United States. The primary distinction is in the role played by each factor. Good faith, for example, is a blanket exception in the federal U.S. system, and is not an exception at all in New York, whereas it is one of many factors that are balanced in Canada, its
weight varying from case to case depending on the circumstances. Consideration of the <cite>Collins</cite> factors in more detail will illuminate the distinctions even more.
<p>
<i>Fairness of the Trial</i>
<br>
Since the Supreme Court's decision in <cite>Mellenthin</cite>, where fairness of the trial is affected, the evidence will likely be excluded without regard to the other circumstances, making violations of this factor lead to near-categorical exclusion.<sup><a href="#ninety6">96</a></sup> Even before <cite>Mellenthin</cite>, any effect on the fairness of the trial was given strong, but not conclusive weight.<sup><a href="#ninety7">97</a></sup> Prior to  <cite>Mellenthin</cite>, however, the Court held that real evidence &quot;obtained in a manner that violated the <cite>Charter</cite> will rarely operate unfairly for that reason alone,&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety8">98</a></sup> as opposed to inculpatory statements which would almost certainly affect trial fairness. That situation appears to have changed.
<p>
To understand why the nature of the evidence is now less conclusive a factor, one must ask how fairness of the trial is initially defined. In <cite>R</cite>. v. <cite>Genest</cite>, Dickson C.J.C. asked the question: &quot;would the admission of the evidence change the balance of the trial because of the nature of the particular <cite>Charter</cite> infringement in that case?&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety9">99</a></sup> This concept of changing the balance of the trial reflects the first rationale listed for the American federal system: do not exclude, if it will put the state in a worse position than it would have been in without the misconduct. In Canada, however, the rationale is best stated: do not <i>admit</i> evidence if it would not have been found but for the violation (i.e. do not put the state in a better position than it would have been in). This line of thought seems to lie behind both <cite>Mellenthin</cite> and the &quot;preliminary question&quot; (or &quot;discoverability&quot;) doctrine outlined recently by the Supreme Court in <cite>R. v. Dersch</cite>.<sup><a href="#hundred">100</a></sup> In <cite>Dersch</cite> the Court said &quot;the preliminary question one must ask is whether the evidence obtained would have been discovered had the <cite>Charter</cite> violation not occurred.&quot; That case built on <cite>R</cite>. v. <cite>Mellenthin</cite>, which in turn built on <cite>Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada</cite>, a case which gave new weight to statements made by Lamer C.J.C. in <cite>Collins</cite>.
<p>
Defining fairness of the trial in this fashion (by discoverability in the absence of a <cite>Charter</cite> violation) forms a more coherent doctrine than the pre-<cite>Mellenthin</cite> view. There are now four main sub-factors under the fairness of the trial area:
<dl>
<dt>a) the nature of the evidence obtained;<sup><a href="#hundred1">101</a></sup>
<dd>Real evidence <i>was</i> generally admitted whereas evidence created by the misconduct was excluded (especially statements or other forms of self-incriminating evidence). 
<dt>b) the nature of the right violated;<sup><a href="#hundred2">102</a></sup>
<dt>c) whether the evidence could have been obtained without a violation;<sup><a href="#hundred3">103</a></sup>
<dd>This factor has not previously been stressed, but with the advent of <cite>Mellenthin</cite> and <cite>Dersch</cite>, this factor may be the seed for a Canadian version of the inevitable discovery and
independent source doctrines. Already, the case of <cite>R</cite>. v. <cite>Grant</cite> appears to provide a rationale similar to the latter doctrine. In <cite>Grant</cite>, a warrant based in part on information from an earlier illegal search was upheld on the basis that other information given for the warrant would have been sufficient in any
case. The inevitable discovery doctrine seems to be mirrored in <cite>R</cite>. v. <cite>Colarusso</cite>, in which blood sample analyses wrongfully seized by police were admissible on the basis that they <i>could</i> have been legally seized in any case with a proper warrant, had the wrongful seizure not taken place. Note that the facts are similar to those in <cite>Dersch</cite>, wherein the analyses were excluded. However, in <cite>Colarusso</cite> the blood had already been legally sampled by the coroner (though not for police use)
whereas in <cite>Dersch</cite>, the doctors involved breached their duty of confidentiality in giving police the samples.
<p>
There is a tension in this factor that is discussed below in more detail. Despite similarities with American doctrines, these factors may not be sufficient on their own to decide the exclusion issue, depending on the balance of other factors.
<dt>d) whether the accused was conscripted against himself<sup><a href="#hundred4">104</a></sup>
<dd>This factor was not one of the factors initially stressed in <cite>Collins</cite>, but it came to the forefront in <cite>R</cite>. v. <cite>Ross</cite>. Lineup evidence after a violation of s.10(b) of the <cite>Charter</cite> (right to counsel) was excluded because the accused was &quot;conscripted against himself since he [was] used as a means for creating evidence for the purposes of the trial.&quot; This concept may have been the beginning of the reasoning in <cite>Mellenthin</cite> and <cite>Dersch</cite>. 
</dl>
If the evidence obtained has probative value and low prejudicial effect (in the sense that it does not lead the jury to
irrational conclusions), is fairness of the trial really being affected?  What the Court seems to be measuring is the taint on the fairness of the judicial process as a whole, beginning with police investigations; taint carries over into the trial. Misconduct in the former throws the latter into disrepute, but does not render the <i>trial</i> unfair unless the Court refers to some fictional &quot;pre-existing balance&quot; of evidence to which each side would have had access in a world that lived according to the <cite>Charter</cite>, as suggested in <cite>Genest</cite>. 
<p>
Certainly the nature of the evidence is itself not conclusive and should not affect the fairness of the trial. Even
inculpatory statements, if they meet common law standards of admissibility,<sup><a href="#hundred5">105</a></sup> will not necessarily have any less probative value or any greater prejudicial effect if they are obtained by a violation of <cite>Charter</cite> rights. If the reliability of the statement is affected, there may be prejudicial effect. However, if reliability is not affected, and in particular if the statement is later corroborated, the fact that it is a statement should not have any effect on trial fairness. Some observers may respond that an illegally obtained statement violates the right to full answer and defence<sup><a href="#hundred6">106</a></sup> by forcing the accused to breach their right to silence in defence and by breaching the right against self-incrimination. However, the same is true of statements not obtained by police misconduct. 
<p>
The difference, and perhaps a crucial one, is that in the case of misconduct, the inculpatory statement may not have been given voluntarily if the rights had been respected (in particular the right to counsel); voluntary statements, absent misconduct, may be presumed to be waivers of the right to silence. Following the logic of the preliminary question doctrine, one could conclude that inculpatory statements that might/would not have been given but for the
misconduct will affect the fairness of the trial. Statements that would have been given in any case would not affect the fairness of the trial but would potentially still bring the administration of justice as a whole into disrepute by affecting the fairness of the investigatory system. 
<p>
The best rationale of exclusion, then, would be based solely on the <i>manner</i> of obtaining the evidence, and not on the nature of the evidence, contrary to the view expressed by Lamer J. in <cite>Collins</cite>.<sup><a href="#hundred7">107</a></sup> Such a route would avoid much of the confusion surrounding how to classify various types of evidence, as if calling it &quot;real evidence&quot; is a magical boundary that once crossed, justifies admission of the evidence.<sup><a href="#hundred8">108</a></sup> It would also be a test that judges could still apply with some precision, especially if evidence on discoverability is led by both sides.
<p>
As pointed out by Paciocco,<sup><a href="#hundred9">109</a></sup> however, cases like <cite>R</cite>. v. <cite>Duarte</cite><sup><a href="#one10">110</a></sup> and <cite>R</cite>. v. <cite>Wiggins</cite><sup><a href="#one11">111</a></sup> appear to involve conscription of defendants against themselves (statements that would not have been heard but for the violation), yet the Court admitted the evidence largely on the basis that police acted in good faith (for example, on the basis of a facially valid law). Either good faith is capable of trumping the
trial fairness factor in some cases, or there is no trial unfairness in those cases. If the latter is true, it might be explained by assuming that police would have followed <cite>Charter</cite> ideals had they known the law was invalid, therefore they would have obtained a warrant and inevitably have obtained the same evidence anyway. This may be a subtle form of inevitable discovery logic, although the Court does not phrase it this way.
<p>
One final ambiguity that may need to be resolved is that <cite>Mellenthin</cite> suggests that fairness of the trial is affected when evidence would not have been found but for the participation of the accused and a violation of their rights. It is not clear why participation of the accused is crucial. Mellenthin helped the officer in that case search his bag, but would there have been any less unfairness to the trial if the officer had just walked along the street and randomly probed through Mellenthin's car when Mellenthin was elsewhere? Surely the doctrine set out in <cite>Mellenthin</cite> should be clarified to read: any evidence which could not have been obtained but for the violation of someone's (not necessarily the accused's) <cite>Charter</cite> rights, will affect the fairness of the
trial.
<p>
<i>Seriousness of the Charter Violation</i>
<br>
The four main factors considered under this grouping include:
<ol>
<li>seriousness of the violation;<sup><a href="#one12">112</a></sup>
<li>the deliberate, willful or good faith character of police action;<sup><a href="#one13">113</a></sup>
<li>urgency and necessity;<sup><a href="#one14">114</a></sup> and,
<li>whether other means were available to obtain the evidence.<sup><a href="#one15">115</a></sup>
</ol>
Although no one factor is sufficient to decide the issue of exclusion, good faith and the reasonableness of the violation (e.g. a reasonable rather than an abusive search) have consistently been used as major justifications for admitting evidence.<sup><a href="#one16">116</a></sup>
<p>      
<i>Effect of Exclusion</i>
<br>
The factors concerning the effect of exclusion are analogous to the American view of the &quot;costs&quot; of excluding relevant evidence, although Canadian courts tend to enunciate more expressly the component elements of the cost. These component factors include:
<ol>
<li>the seriousness of the charge;<sup><a href="#one17">117</a></sup>
<li>how essential the evidence is to the case;<sup><a href="#one18">118</a></sup> and
<li>the availability of other remedies short of exclusion.<sup><a href="#one19">119</a></sup>
</ol>
As discussed above, courts in the United States expressly give great weight to the cost of exclusion in defining their balance. Canadian courts do not always emphasize the factor expressly; in fact, they often downplay it.<sup><a href="#one20">120</a></sup>
<p>
Since the seriousness of the crime and the key nature of the questioned evidence seem to be such strong factors to the American courts, and likely to the general public as well, I reviewed a sample of recent exclusion cases with <cite>Charter</cite> violations<sup><a href="one21">121</a></sup> to see if any trends appeared. The survey is not
intended to be conclusive or statistically accurate because even reported cases are pre-selected for certain reasons; rather it is intended to give a quick impression of how these factors <i>may</i> impact on exclusion decisions by taking the first small step beyond theory to look at the actual practice of the courts. To make a more accurate assessment of trends, a comparison of a random sample of actual trials dealing with exclusion questions would be required (working from transcripts to gain an objective view of the weight given to various factors). 
<p>
Of 53 Canadian cases noted, only 20 resulted in exclusion of the evidence (thirty-eight per cent). Of those 20 exclusions, only two occurred in a murder case (statements and related conduct), and the Court upheld the conviction directly in one of those cases anyway due to the strength of other evidence.<sup><a href="#one22">122</a></sup> The rest were predominantly narcotic or impaired driving offences, with one assault
and one break and enter. 
<dl>
<dt><i>Murders</i>:<dd>Of seven murder cases in the sample, only one effectively resulted in exclusion affecting
the trial. 
<dt><i>Statements</i>: <dd>Six of thirteen statements were excluded (forty-six per cent).
<dt><i>Real Evidence</i>: <dd>Only seven of twenty-two pieces of real evidence in issue were excluded (thirty-two per cent) (not counting breath and blood sample evidence).
</dl>
Comparing the Canadian cases to a sample of New York cases<sup><a href="#one23">123</a></sup> reveals some differences, although the smaller sample size makes conclusions tenuous at best. Of 15 cases with rights violations, only six exclusions resulted (forty per cent), similar to the Canadian ratio. Of the six exclusions, one was a murder case involving statements.<sup><a href="#one24">124</a></sup> The rest were possession offences (weapons or narcotics). In New York, half of the excluded pieces of evidence (three of six) were statements, as compared to only twenty-six per
cent in Canada.
<dl>
<dt><i>Murders</i>: <dd>one of two resulted in exclusion.
<dt><i>Statements</i>: <dd>three of four were excluded (seventy-five per cent---much higher than in Canada)
<dt><i>Real Evidence</i>: <dd>three of nine excluded (thirty-three per cent, similar to Canada)
</dl>
Several possible generalizations suggest themselves from this brief survey. First, Canadian courts may give more weight to the seriousness of the offence and the probative value of the evidence than they are saying (although it should be noted that there are simply far fewer murder cases in the system than impaired driving cases, for example; there are murder cases in which evidence was excluded that did not fall in the random sample).<sup><a href="#one25">125</a></sup> Of seven murders, only one crucial piece of evidence was excluded. Second, statements are more readily excluded than real evidence in both jurisdictions, particularly in New York. New York courts, then, may be looking at the nature of the evidence even though they do not expressly say so. Again, hasty conclusions should be avoided, because it may simply be that statements are not usually as crucial to the case as real evidence, and the cost of excluding statements is therefore lower. Third, overall, the chances of succeeding with a suppression motion are not markedly different in the two jurisdictions, but this fails to consider a) variations in types of crimes dealt with,<sup><a href="#one26">126</a></sup> and b) the possible difference in filtering of exclusion claims at the level of defining whether a right was ever violated.<sup><a href="#one27">127</a></sup>
<p>
One factor largely ignored is the effect of increased probative value. For example, blood tests and DNA analyses in
particular may be highly probative. To exclude evidence of such a high probative value as a DNA match might be more difficult for a court than the exclusion of more ambiguous evidence; at the very least it might affect the balance of factors more than other types of evidence.<sup><a href="#one28">128</a></sup>
<p>
<i>Tensions</i>
<br>
Several internal tensions are set up within the balance of factors without a clear resolution. Both the `seriousness of the offence' and the `possibility of obtaining evidence by another manner' could weigh either for or against exclusion. The seriousness of the offence, as indicated, is often downplayed, but may favour admission more than is granted. However, as <cite>Collins</cite> points out, the more serious the offence, the greater the consequences to the accused, therefore it should favour exclusion, at least where fairness of the trial is in question.<sup><a href="#one29">129</a></sup> In practice the courts may have come down on the side of admission, regardless of whether the evidence affects the fairness of the trial, but it remains unclear. 
<p>
If evidence could have been obtained by another means, obtaining it by a <cite>Charter</cite> violation suggests disrespect for the <cite>Charter</cite> and exclusion is mandated under the &quot;seriousness of the violation&quot; category, however, in <cite>R</cite>. v. <cite>Grant</cite> and <cite>R</cite>. v. <cite>Colarusso</cite>, the Supreme Court seems to have approved admission of tainted evidence largely <i>on the basis</i> that it could have been obtained in any case.<sup><a href="#one30">130</a></sup> In those cases and in <cite>Mellenthin</cite>, inevitable discoverability and independent sources for obtaining evidence suggest that under the first category, fairness of the trial will not be affected. It is not clear how this tension is to be resolved without overruling or clarifying either <cite>Collins</cite> or <cite>Mellenthin</cite> on this single point. 
<p>
COMPARISON
<p>
The Canadian balance of factors expressly considers three factors that American courts either fail to address or give low weight---the nature of the evidence, the conscription of the accused against himself, and the seriousness of the rights violation. Regarding the former two factors, the Canadian courts appear to be moving towards the American position, looking less at the type of evidence and more at whether the evidence would have been discovered without the violation. Regarding the third factor, Canadian courts continue to take a harsh view of abusive police conduct. Many if not most exclusions involve cases of willful or abusive rights violations.<sup><a href="#one31">131</a></sup> In the United States, abusive conduct is occasionally mentioned as a possible factor, but rules such as the inevitable discovery doctrine potentially condone abusive or willful misconduct. In Canada, which has no categorical exceptions, there is a greater deterrence check on police misconduct since misconduct weighs heavily in the balance of factors.
<p>
There are both advantages and disadvantages to having a balance of factors rather than a more categorical rule with fixed exceptions. One advantage is that judges have more flexibility in weighing concerns on a case by case basis. Canadian courts also do the balancing more expressly than American courts, which often merely state their conclusions. This allows lawyers, other judges, and the public generally to see the balance and get a sense for the weight of the different factors. Public opinion can track judges' behavior and provide feedback. This is more important in Canada than in the United States because s. 24 expressly requires a determination as to whether the administration of justice will be brought into disrepute.<sup><a href="#one32">132</a></sup> The drawback of a balance is that it may just provide a broad discretion for judges to concentrate more on the facts of each case than on underlying principles. For example, the seriousness of the charge may become a disproportionately emphasized factor, psychologically, while other factors serve as a mask to justify any decision made. If one trusts the judiciary, a balance may be appropriate, otherwise bright-line rules and exceptions might lead to a more principled approach.
<p>
The Canadian approach has distinct advantages over the American approach in two senses. First, the jurisprudence mandating protection of individual rights is firmly rooted in the text of the constitutional exclusionary rule, hence there is no real danger of the Court extinguishing the exclusionary rule. In the United States, however, there is a real danger that a conservative `crime-control' court could (or may already have) undermined the rule by refusing to
recognize a constitutional imperative for rights protection via the exclusionary rule. The only resort for due process proponents, if the trend continues, may be through strengthened state exclusionary rules, based independently on state constitutions, as in New York.
<p>
The second advantage of the Canadian experience is the genuine flexibility of the <cite>Collins</cite> balance. While it leaves a great deal of discretion in the judge's hands, in the last ten years the courts have proven their willingness under the <cite>Charter</cite> to go far beyond pre-<cite>Charter</cite> jurisprudence in excluding evidence, rapidly building a case law foundation that explicitly and implicitly tries to balance elements of rights protection, police regulation, crime control and attention to community morality. Even the elements of the <cite>Collins</cite> test themselves show a concern for this broad range of interests, and the factors that courts seem to have stressed most in recent years (fairness of the trial, good faith on the part of police, the type of right infringed, and the seriousness of the crime) demonstrate a balance that at the very least does not prejudice rights to other interests. The Court has even recently required that police advise suspects in breathalyzer cases of a
1-800 number that Ontario has made available for duty counsel assistance. There was no constitutional requirement that the program be set up initially but since it has in fact been put in place, the Supreme Court has ruled that it must be made <i>effectively</i> available otherwise evidence of test results may be excluded. 
<p>
The <cite>Mellenthin</cite> case may even have further strengthened the <cite>Collins</cite> test for the accused by stating that if fairness of the trial is affected, evidence will be excluded, regardless of the other factors. However, <cite>Mellenthin</cite> also ushered the inevitable discovery doctrine into Canadian law, providing a new tool for both the accused and the Crown to justify admission or exclusion. In many cases it may work to the disadvantage of the accused. Are inculpatory statements now no longer going to affect fairness of the trial if the Crown can show
that they would have been uttered in any case, for example?
<p>
One advantage of the American system which may be useful is the assignment of definite weight to certain factors such as good faith and inevitable discoverability. Many Canadian decisions spend very little time discussing the weight assigned to <cite>Collins</cite> factors in a given case, perhaps because it is not clear what weight
they <i>should</i> be assigning. Making the weight clearer eliminates fears of arbitrariness in the law and one can establish clear guidelines without necessarily laying down rigid categorical rules. Since the <cite>Charter</cite> exclusionary rule only arrived in Canada just over a decade ago, the courts may still be leaving the questions open somewhat. More likely however is that they have reached a stable balance and are now adapting slowly to new
situations as they arise. Given the balance noted above, such a strategy is appropriate and not inconsistent with the purpose of the exclusionary rule in Canada. The American rule is relatively consistent with its stated purpose, but as noted, that purpose itself is threatened, particularly as concern with crime control in the United States continues to grow. 
<p>
An area in which rapid change is needed in all of the jurisdictions, however, is in the threshold requirements of standing law, which presently bar many people from the protection of the rule no matter how flagrant the violation of the right.
<p>
<h3>IV: Standing</h3>

A crucial element of any study of the exclusionary rule is the standing threshold which must be crossed before a suppression motion can even be considered on its merits. Examination of standing jurisprudence in the three jurisdictions reveals major contradictions between the substantive principles behind the exclusionary rule and
the standing threshold as presently defined. In order to reconcile principle and practice, an alternative standing regime will be presented and evaluated at the end of this section. First, however, I shall briefly review the present law in each jurisdiction.
<p>
UNITED STATES (FEDERAL)
<p>
The federal standing rule has evolved considerably in the past thirty years,<sup><a href="#one33">133</a></sup> beginning with the Supreme Court's decision in <cite>Katz v. United States</cite><sup><a href="#one34">134</a></sup> which marked a major change from Fourth Amendment exclusionary claims based on property/possessory interests to one based on a &quot;legitimate expectation of privacy.&quot;  Since this change, standing law has evolved along lines paralleling suppression requirements in search and seizure, beginning with <cite>Alderman v. United States</cite><sup><a href ="#one35">135</a></sup> in which the Court followed a deterrence rationale in deciding not to extend standing to other defendants.<sup><a href="#one36">136</a></sup> One could only urge suppression
of evidence if one's rights were violated by the search itself and not merely by the introduction of evidence at trial.<sup><a href="#one37">137</a></sup> The cases of <cite>Rakas v. Illinois</cite><sup><a href="#one38</a>138</a></sup> and <cite>United States v. Salvucci</cite>[a href="#one39</a></sup> effectively closed the door on significant expansion of the standing doctrine, rejecting Justice Fortas' dissent in <cite>Alderman</cite>, which advocated extension of standing to at least those who were targets of searches, if not to anyone against whom the evidence was to be used.<sup><a href="one40">140</a></sup>
<p>
In <cite>Rakas</cite>, the Supreme Court outlined two criteria that must be met before standing will be granted: &quot;first, whether the proponent of a particular legal right has alleged `injury in fact,' and, second, whether the proponent is asserting his own legal rights and interests rather than basing his claim for relief upon the rights of third parties.&quot;<sup><a href="#one41">141</a></sup>To assert such a right, a defendant can no longer simply rely on possessory interests because <cite>Katz</cite> was construed to mean that &quot;the protection of the Fourth  Amendment depends not upon a property right in the invaded place but upon whether the person who claims the protection of the Amendment has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the invaded place.&quot;<sup><a href="#one42">142</a></sup> Not even ownership of the object seized is of any assistance in establishing standing, without the expectation of privacy.<sup><a href="#one43">143</a></sup> One is then led to wonder why, if proprietary interests are not\break `sufficient,' they should still be `necessary' if the Amendment is really about protecting people not places.
<p>
Prior to <cite>Salvucci</cite>, there had been a limited `automatic standing' rule for defendants in possession cases, because establishing standing would require the assertion of a possessory interest, thereby amounting to self-incrimination.<sup><a href="#one44">144</a></sup> The Court granted relief for the same dilemma in non-possessory cases in <cite>Simmons v. United States</cite><sup><a href="#one45">145</a></sup> (bank robbery) by holding that suppression hearing testimony could not be used against the defendant at trial on the actual charge. Acting on <cite>Simmons</cite>, the Supreme Court in <cite>Salvucci</cite> held that there was no longer any reason to
grant automatic standing as the paradox had been resolved. Indeed, the Court went so far as to say that both a possessory interest <i>and</i> an expectation of privacy in the invaded area were necessary.<sup><a href="#one46">146</a></sup> The same case also indicated that there was no legal contradiction in having prosecutors argue that there was no possessory interest at the suppression hearing and argue the opposite view at trial.<sup><a href="#one47">147</a></sup>
<p>
In cases citing Fifth and Sixth Amendment violations, there is also a clear reluctance to extend standing to third party defendants, whose rights were not directly violated. Following the <cite>United States v. White</cite>,<sup><a href="#one48">148</a></sup> the Court in <cite>Bellis v. United States</cite><sup><a href="#one49">149</a></sup> denied standing to a law partner with respect to the suppression of firm financial records. The defendant, as &quot;an individual cannot rely upon the privilege to avoid producing the
records of a collective entity which are in his possession in a representative capacity, even if these records might incriminate him personally.&quot;<sup><a href="#one50">150</a></sup> This decision may turn on the facts of the case, given that the defendant's right was not violated directly and the corporation itself (the direct victim) had no rights to protection from self-incrimination as it was not a &quot;natural individual.&quot;<sup><a href="#one51">151</a></sup> Later cases such as <cite>United States v. Fortna</cite><sup><a href="#one52">152</a></sup> and <cite>United States v. Robinson-Munoz</cite>,<sup><a href="#one53">153</a></sup> however, clearly indicate that even direct violation of a co-defendant's rights cannot be used by a defendant to bar evidence from that defendant's trial.
<p>
The great difficulty with the Court's approach in recent years has been the malleability of the standard of a &quot;legitimate expectation of privacy.&quot;  Expectation of privacy is defined in a way that makes it very hard for defendants to establish such an expectation. For example, there was no expectation of privacy regarding evidence:
<blockquote>
a) Seized from a friend's purse;<sup><a href="#one54">154</a></sup><br>
b) Seized from a co-defendant's home;<sup><a href="#one55">155</a></sup><br>
c) Seized from a car when the defendant was a passenger;<sup><a href="#one56">156</a></sup><br>
d) Found by a helicopter overview of private property;<sup><a href="#one57">157</a></sup><br>
e) Seized from an acquaintance's apartment;<sup><a href="#one58">158</a></sup><br>
f) Seized from garbage;<sup><a href="#one59">159</a></sup>
</blockquote>
From the picture that emerges, many people might contest the Court's view as to when an expectation of privacy exists. While many might concede that there is no expectation of privacy in garbage left by the street or in a strange apartment (not yours) when the door is left ajar,<sup><a href="#one60">160</a></sup> most would likely strongly protest that they should not be subject to warrantless aerial fly-overs when they have made their intention to maintain privacy clear by putting up high fences. Nor would they acknowledge that they have given up an expectation of privacy in something placed in a friend's purse (except with respect to that person). 
<p>
Two problems lie at the heart of the Federal Courts' jurisprudence---first, it has defined expectation of privacy in a
debatable manner generally, as noted above, and second, it has not defined the expectation of privacy specifically in relation to agents of the state. There is no reason why one's expectation of privacy with regard to state officers is decreased at all when one keeps something in a friend's apartment or a friend's bag. It is only decreased with respect to the friend or others the person expects to have access to it.<sup><a href="#one61">161</a></sup> The state should not be in that class of persons. As the discussion of New York and Canada will show, all three jurisdictions have similar problems, as well as conflicts between the rationale for their exclusion rule and the operation of the standing rule, problems which shall be addressed at the end of this section by a new model for standing in such cases.
<p>
NEW YORK
<p>
In most ways, the criteria for standing in New York State are the same as those in the federal jurisdiction, varying little except in terms of the facts of each case when it comes to establishing a legitimate expectation of privacy. <cite>People v. Hansen</cite>,<sup><a href="#one62">162</a></sup> for example, and <cite>People v. Ponder</cite><sup><a href="#one63">163</a></sup> mirror the decisions in <cite> Jones</cite> and <cite>Salvucci</cite> respectively.<sup><a href="#one64">164</a></sup> In <cite>Ponder</cite>, the state Court declined to broaden the federal rule on standing, following <cite>Katz</cite>, <cite>Mancusim v. DeForte</cite>,<sup><a href="#one65">165</a></sup> and <cite>Rakas</cite>, to require a legitimate expectation of privacy before standing would be granted. 
<p>
In <cite>People v. Rodriguez</cite>, the Court outlined the nature of the privacy threshold test. &quot;The number of times a person stays in a particular place, the length and nature of the stay, the indicia of connectedness and privacy, like change of clothes or sharing expenses or household burdens, are all factors which may alone or in combination with other factors support a reasonable expectation of privacy which is protected by the Fourth Amendment.&quot;<sup><a href="#one66">166</a></sup> These factors may be irrelevant, however, to one's expectation of privacy with respect to agents of the state. Practically, the Court has found no expectation of privacy in such cases as:
<blockquote>
a) the search of a car owned and operated by the defendant's girlfriend;<sup><a href="#one67">167</a></sup><br>
b) the search of stolen jeep;<sup><a href="#one68">168</a></sup><br>
c) the search of someone else's apartment;<sup><a href="#one69">169</a></sup><br>
d) the search of a relative's schoolbag.<sup><a href="#one70">170</a></sup>
</blockquote>
These cases are all dependent, however, on the factual context, what I shall call a `contextual expectation of privacy.' The Court did find a reasonable expectation of privacy, for example, when contraband was recovered from an apartment in which the defendant was a daily occupant, took naps and meals, admitted people to the apartment, was present during the search, and had a key. Where any Court will draw the line depends on the facts and the
Court's view of one's expectation of privacy, at best conjecture, at worst a fiction.
<p>
Like the Supreme Court, the New York courts have decided<sup><a href="#one71">171</a></sup> that deterrence is the primary purpose of the exclusionary rule, but that the deterrence value of giving standing to &quot;third parties&quot; whose legitimate expectations of privacy were not directly violated is insufficient to offset the harm to society. If we examine Canadian law now, it seems that the standing issue is still unsettled, but seems to favour the American view somewhat. 
<p>
CANADA
<p>
The Supreme Court has yet to rule directly on how far standing extends with respect to s. 24(2) petitions, but in <cite>Collins</cite>, Lamer C.J.C. asked the following question with respect to the requirement that the applicant's rights or freedoms had been infringed or denied: 
<blockquote>
There are at least two problems [remaining to be decided by later cases]: must the rights or freedoms infringed or denied under the second prerequisite be those of the applicant, and must the applicant be the accused?  For example if the admission of evidence obtained as the result of the unreasonable search of a third party's home could bring the administration of justice into disrepute, could the accused (if for example his right to a fair hearing was thereby
infringed) or the third party move under s. 24(2) for the exclusion of the evidence?<sup><a href ="#one72">172</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The open-ended nature of the question could imply that the Supreme Court will be bound less by the strict text of s. 24 than by the spirit of the section. At the very least, it leaves open the possibility that admission of illegally obtained evidence would affect the fairness of the trial of a third party (s. 11(d) of the <cite>Charter</cite> or a s. 7 liberty interest), thereby establishing standing. Such a view would be more consistent with the Court's position on fairness of the trial outlined above<sup><a href="#one73">173</a></sup> in <cite>Mellenthin</cite> than the present position taken at various courts of appeal.
<p>
Several provincial courts of appeal have understood s. 24(2) to limit standing to &quot;anyone whose rights or freedoms, as guaranteed by this <cite>Charter</cite>, have been infringed or denied,&quot; reading s. 24 as a whole quite literally. If no personal right is infringed directly, one has no standing. Such an approach, however, seems to conflict with the underlying rationale of the exclusionary rule in Canada; apparent condonation of the violation of third party rights is as inconsistent with saving the administration of justice from disrepute as it is with the American rationale of deterrence. 
<p>
To date, the leading cases have come from the courts in Alberta and British Columbia. <cite>R</cite>. v. <cite>Leaney</cite><sup><a href="#one74">174</a></sup> was one of the first cases to deal with a petition to have
evidence obtained from a co-defendant's home excluded under s. 24(2). Like American courts, the Alberta Court of Appeal limited standing to those personally affected by the rights violation. Based on <cite>Hunter v. Southam Inc</cite>.,<sup><a href="#one75">175</a></sup> the Court held that &quot;the right protected by s. 8 of the Canadian <cite>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite> was personal, and that s. 8 protected an individual's `reasonable expectation of privacy.' There is nothing peculiar in the circumstances to suggest that Leaney had a reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to any of the searches.&quot;<sup><a href  = "#one76">176</a></sup> Rawlinson, the co-defendant whose home was searched, did not question the validity of the search and the Court took note of this fact in its decision. 
<p>
The Alberta test, which echoes the American standing rule in many respects, was moderated somewhat in <cite>R</cite>. v. <cite>Montoute</cite>,<sup><a href="#one77">177</a></sup> a case of conspiracy to traffic in
narcotics in which intercepted private communications between a co-conspirator and a police agent were not authorized by court order. Contrary to the holding in <cite>Leaney</cite>, the majority of the Court stated that even though the defendant's s. 8 rights had not been violated, he was still entitled to have the evidence excluded under
s. 24(2) if to admit the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute; this holding, however, seems contingent on the fact that it was a conspiracy charge, which brings certain unusual hearsay exceptions into play that would normally not be available.<sup><a href="#one78">178</a></sup> The dissenting judge did not expressly differ on the question of availability of standing, differing only in his view that no such disrepute had arisen on the facts of this case.
<p>
 In British Columbia, on the other hand, <cite>R</cite>. v. <cite>Fraser</cite><sup><a href="#one79">179</a></sup> held that the &quot;language of s. 24(1) makes it clear that the applicant for relief must be the person whose rights were infringed.&quot;<sup><a href="#one80">180</a></sup> Section 24(2) was then linked to s. 24(1) because the text
of s. 24(2) refers to ``proceedings under subsection (1).&quot;<sup><a href="one81">181</a></sup> The comments by Lamer C.J.C. in <cite>Collins</cite>, noted above, were interpreted as no more than &quot;a statement that the infringement of the rights of one might also constitute an infringement of the rights of another,&quot;<sup><a href="#one82">182</a></sup> which is a very narrow reading. In <cite>R</cite>. v. <cite>Clymore</cite>,<sup><a href="#one83">183</a></sup> evidence seized from the defendant's father's car gave no standing to the defendant as there had been no reasonable expectation of privacy on his part. Similarly, in <cite>R</cite>. v. <cite>Arason</cite>,<sup><a href="#one84">184</a></sup> the Court of Appeal refused standing because the premises searched had been leased
to someone other than the accused and that person would have consented to the search. British Columbia, then, has a narrower approach to standing under s.24(2) than Alberta at this time.
<p>
In Ontario, the only other jurisdiction to grapple with the standing question, there is no clear ruling. The leading case of <cite>R</cite>. v. <cite>Pugliese</cite><sup><a href="#one85">185</a></sup> denied the defendant standing to quash a warrant for a search because he had no proprietary interest in the apartment (though he owned the building) or in the drug-related paraphernalia found. However, the Court expressly distinguished the absence of standing to
quash a warrant (which is like a replacement for the property owner's permission to enter) from the ability to get standing to challenge the admissibility of evidence obtained by the warrant. 
<blockquote>
When an accused, such as the appellant, asserts at his trial that there has been a breach of his s. 8 <cite>Charter</cite> right to be secure from unreasonable search or seizure, he is asserting a particular right to privacy which may, on occasion, be unrelated to any recognized proprietary or possessory right. Section 8 of the
<cite>Charter</cite> is directed to the protection of the security of the person, not the protection of his property, and it is the appellant's personal exposure to the consequences of the search and seizure that gives him the right to challenge, not the search warrant itself, but the admission into evidence at his trial of the fact of the search and the account of what was seized.<sup><a href="#one86">186</a></sup>
</blockquote>
While the comments regarding standing of third parties may be <i>obiter</i> on the facts of the case, they clearly point to a more expansive view of standing than that proposed by courts in Alberta and British Columbia. Unfortunately for defendants, that expansive view has been retracted in the recent case of <cite>R</cite>.
v. <i>Edwards</i><sup><a href="#one87">187</a></sup> in which the majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal held that a
third party had no privacy interest in a girlfriend's apartment, and since no right had been infringed, that person had no standing. A dissent by Abella J.A., however, would have granted standing on the basis that a contextually-defined privacy interest did exist (though not one defined solely by proprietary or possessory circumstances)
because of his association with the apartment in question (key, clothing, overnight stays, etc.). Abella's dissent echoes the New York jurisprudence on the degree of connection to the site, and does not really follow the same principle set out in <i>obiter</i> in <cite>Pugliese</cite>. In any case, it seems that the Supreme Court may
soon make a final ruling on this issue.
<p>
How the Supreme Court will actually fill the gap in standing law remains to be seen, particularly since several of the major cases to date involve consent or probable consent on the part of the person whose rights were directly affected, and therefore possibly no rights violation at all. Jonathon Dawe, in a recent paper addressing the standing dilemma,<sup><a href="#one88">188</a></sup> suggests that the Court would do well to learn from the American &quot;mistakes&quot; and embrace a broader standing rule in which the interpretation of both the right (s.8 in his paper) and of s. 24 itself are undertaken in light of <cite>Charter</cite> values. While Dawe looked only at search and seizure cases, his point that the American example should not be followed in Canada is a valid one. The American rule is based on a deterrence principle, one which is rejected as the primary purpose of s. 24(2) (and as I point out below, a narrow standing rule is equally inconsistent with the American rationale behind the rule). Whereas Dawe uses a largely normative evaluation of standing law (much of with which I agree), the analysis below concentrates in large part on ensuring a rational connection between the purpose of the exclusionary rule and its practice. In particular, Dawe suggests that the purpose behind the Canadian rule should be to protect the integrity of the judicial system as a whole rather than just the integrity of the judiciary. Such a view would incorporate some elements of police regulation while emphasizing the importance of rights protection. In effect, however, the factors of the <cite>Collins</cite> test itself show that the Court <i>has addressed</i> more than mere judicial integrity <i>per se</i>. Using the <cite>Collins</cite> test, the Court has defined judicial integrity in a manner that considers elements of rights protection (the type of right, fairness of the trial generally), police regulation (good faith, seriousness of the violation, other means available, urgency/necessity), crime control/community standards (necessity of evidence, seriousness of crime, etc.) and societal protection (urgency/necessity). Judicial integrity is only preserved if this field of values, which often conflict, is properly balanced and reconciled. Therefore, while the Court's approach to s. 24(2) <i>is</i> balanced on the whole, it need only reconcile this vision of the substantive law of the exclusionary rule with its vision of standing. Keeping this need in mind, contradictions in standing law are presented below, followed by a new model that may solve some of those problems.
<p>
TOWARDS A NEW MODEL OF STANDING LAW
<p>
Standing rules in the United States, which limit standing to people directly aggrieved, are inconsistent with both the
deterrence and the `judicial integrity' rationales for exclusion. It would be consistent to some extent with the personal constitutional remedy theory of exclusion, but that doctrine is the one soundly rejected by the Supreme Court in <cite>Leon</cite> and <cite>Calandra</cite>. In Canada as well, where the primary rationale is to avoid bringing the administration of justice into disrepute by a balance of relevant factors, a standing rule which admits evidence unless obtained in direct violation of the defendant's rights would also be inconsistent with the <cite>Charter</cite>.
<p>
In both the U.S. `deterrence v. cost' balance and the Canadian s. 24(2) balance, the only way to justify such a narrow
standing rule (which excludes third parties to the violation) is if the proportionality of factors is such that: a) in the United States, the loss of extra deterrence value is more than offset by the prevention of greater costs to society and b) in Canada, significantly less disrepute arises from using the fruit of a third party violation than the fruit of a direct violation of someone's rights. Both arguments are hard to justify. The more people encompassed by the exclusionary rule, the greater the deterrence. Similarly, it seems odd that disrepute in using tainted evidence
depends on who suffers the violation. Judicial condonation of  <i>any</i> violation seems inconsistent with the Court's interpretation of s. 24(2). It would be odd to say that a minor infraction against a defendant's rights might lead to exclusion of probative evidence, but that a flagrant and abusive violation of a third party's rights would not, due to the standing threshold. Indeed, violation of an innocent person's rights to get at a guilty party seems even more reprehensible than violation of a guilty party's rights directly.
<p>
In Canada, a categorical standing rule is even harder to justify because the only way to <i>know</i> if the administration of justice is brought into disrepute is to <i>do</i> a s. 24(2) balance. The present standing law prevents one from ever getting to that stage. 
<p>
Arguments in Canada against extending the standing rule depend on the text of s. 24(2). There are two possible
interpretations of that section. If the text in s. 24 is strictly adhered to, as in <cite>R</cite>. v. <cite>Fraser</cite>, one may first have to cross the threshold of proving that one's rights have been violated, regardless of the amount of disrepute that may result from admission of the evidence. A second interpretation, more in keeping with the spirit of the <cite>Charter</cite> as a whole, is that s. 24(2) provides that whenever an application is brought for a remedy under s. 24, once the &quot;court concludes that evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed or denied <i>any</i> rights or freedoms guaranteed by this <cite>Charter</cite>,&quot;<sup><a href="#one89">189</a></sup> the threshold for standing is not whether one's rights were directly violated (as set out in s. 24(1)) but whether the
administration of justice would be brought into disrepute by admission of the evidence. Section 24(2) should be seen as going beyond s. 24(1) to provide its own remedy threshold when a case of illegally-obtained evidence is in question. Such a view would provide internal consistency in the law by bringing the law of standing into line with the substantive law of s. 24(2), a result that seems more appropriate than the narrow reading in <cite>Fraser</cite>.
<p>
In the United States, there must be a violation of the defendant's rights to establish standing. In Canada, one can
establish standing in the same way, or possibly by showing that the administration of justice has been brought into disrepute by violation of a third party's rights or freedoms.<sup><a href="#one90">190</a></sup> There are two main ways to establish standing on the first basis (that a right of the accused has been violated under search and seizure provisions): 1) by showing that the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy; and/or 2) by showing that the right to a fair trial will be affected.<sup><a href="#one91">191</a></sup>
<p>
The latter possibility was discussed not only in the Canadian context but in the United States as well. <cite>U.S. v. Merkt</cite><sup><a href="#one92">192</a></sup> held that a &quot;defendant may assert her own Fifth Amendment right to a fair trial as a valid objection to the introduction of statements extracted from a non-defendant by coercion or other inquisitional tactics.&quot;<sup><a href="#one93">193</a></sup> The threshold for unfairness is a high one, however, as the defendant must establish that the &quot;government's investigation  methods resulted in a fundamentally unfair trial,&quot;<sup><a href="#one94">194</a></sup> a burden that was not met in
<cite>Merkt</cite>. In that case, access to counsel was barred by police while third parties were questioned, the resulting statements being the impugned evidence. Because their testimony in person at the defendant's trial was similar to their statements (with inconsistencies, however), there was held to be no fundamental unfairness to Merkt. 
<p>
Since <cite>Merkt</cite>, no signs of life in this reasoning have been seen in the United States, nor, however has it been expressly rejected. Its role in Canada remains uncertain, although the Court in <cite>Fraser</cite> also suggested in <i>obiter</i> that a judge could &quot;exclude evidence of a witness who at the time of testifying was
under threat, drugged or had recently been beaten. Such conduct would be a breach of the accused's right to a fair
trial.&quot;<sup><a href="#one95">195</a></sup> More recently, the Ontario Court of Appeal, in the case of <cite>R</cite>. v. <cite>Paolitto</cite>,<sup><a href="#one96">196</a></sup> has held that the accused's right to a fair trial is not infringed by admission of evidence when standing is refused to a third party. If the ruling in  <cite>Mellenthin</cite>, however, is interpreted to mean that &quot;evidence which would not have been discovered but for a <cite>Charter</cite> violation affects the fairness of the trial&quot; in the context of a s. 24(2) consideration of the merits of the case, it would be very difficult to say that such evidence affects the fairness of the trial any less, simply because the right violated was that of someone other than the defendant. If this view is valid, then fairness of the trial (a right of the defendant) is affected even if the defendant was not technically affected by the initial violation; violation of the right to a fair trial then gives the defendant standing even under a strict interpretation of s. 24(1). To hold otherwise would be to risk a grave and inexplicable contradiction between the substantive definition of what &quot;affects fairness of the trial&quot; in terms of a s. 24(2) analysis of the merits as compared to a standing analysis. In any case, a new model of standing is needed to resolve the confusion in all three jurisdictions.
<p>
<i>A New Model of Standing</i>
<br>
In cases of search and seizure of goods from a third party, there are two main factors affecting the legitimate expectation of privacy. The first is whether one has a possessory/proprietary interest in the object seized or in the place invaded. The second is whether or not the third party subjected to the search consented to it. One must ask not only &quot;is there an expectation of privacy?,&quot; but &quot;with respect to whom?&quot;  One may have a low expectation of privacy with respect to a friend to whom one has given something or in whose apartment one has left something. Likewise one may have a low expectation of privacy regarding regular foreseeable visitors to
that apartment, or regarding the friend's friends, depending on the circumstances (which can be defined in court). One is unlikely to have much lower an expectation of privacy with respect to the police however, than if the object was in one's own bag or apartment. In <cite>Rawlings</cite>, for example, the very fact that Rawlings placed the
object in the purse could be evidence that he was seeking a higher expectation of privacy than by leaving it in the open. Other factors such as visibility of the evidence to the public (for example, plain view in an automobile), and warnings or special instructions to the third party, will also affect the level of expectation of privacy if defined in this way.
<p>
The issue of consent of the third party in allowing the search is a difficult one. On the one hand, it may render the search entirely reasonable; at the very least it indicates police were operating in good faith, unless there is evidence police knew the sought-after material did not belong to the third party (for example searching a car in which the real target is a passenger). On the other hand, should a third party be allowed to consent when he/she has taken on an obligation?  Certainly, it seems that third party consent, in general, will render the search reasonable.  
<p>
As long as the search subject's choice is an informed and non-coerced one, the only quarrel of the defendant should be with the third party's frame of mind and not with police conduct. An informed choice implies at a minimum that the standard in <cite>Florida v. Bostick</cite><sup><a href="#one97">197</a></sup> is met---that subjects are told they can refuse a search. To be fair, subjects should also be given <cite>Miranda</cite> rights or at least advised of the right to counsel in such situations, although this goes further than the American jurisprudence. In Canada, given the wide definition of detention,<sup><a href="#one98">198</a></sup> the courts should require a
strict standard for informed consent to searches.
<p>
Nevertheless, even with consent, the defendant could still have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the evidence, but there will have been no unreasonable search. There may however have been an unreasonable <i>seizure</i>. Can the police seize items that do not belong to the subject of the search? Should they be under a duty to ask whether items belong to people searched, and, if they belong to someone else, should the police be allowed to seize the evidence in any case?  If they do seize items in such a case, the defendant's rights may still be <i>directly</i> violated as an unreasonable seizure (though not an unreasonable search), as long as the Court finds that the defendant still had a legitimate expectation of privacy <i>regarding the police</i>. This last fact depends on the
context, as discussed above.
<p>
To simplify the application of standing rules, I shall consider several general circumstances as defined by the two main factors set out above.
<ol>
<li><i>Defendant has a possessory/proprietary interest in the evidence or in the place searched.</i><br>
<dl>
<dt>a) Third party consents:
<dd>i) if informed consent was given, the search is presumptively reasonable, although the Court may still hold that the seizure was not. Standing depends on the Court's view of the latter point.
<dd>ii) if no informed consent was given, the search was presumptively unreasonable; the defendant retained a legitimate expectation of privacy with respect to the police, concerning both the search and the seizure (unless other factors as discussed above indicate there was no subjective expectation of privacy). If there was a legitimate expectation of privacy, standing should be granted to the defendant.
<dt>b)  Third party does not consent:
<dd>i) the same result as in 1(a)(ii) above. Standing should be granted.
</dl>
<li><i>The defendant has <b>no</b> possessory/proprietary interest in the evidence or the location of the search (or the violation is of another person's right to counsel, etc.)</i><br>
The defendant has no expectation of privacy personally, therefore the standing rule depends on one's rationale for the exclusionary rule. The two rules should follow consistent parallel lines.
<dl>
<dt>a) Third party consents:
<dd>i) if it is an informed choice, there is no violation and therefore no standing under any rationale;
<dd>ii) if it is not an informed choice, it is presumptively as if there had been a violation, with results similar to those under 2(b) below.
<dt>b)  Third party does not consent:
<dd>i) If the purpose of the rule is <i>to promote deterrence</i>, standing should be granted as there has been a violation of &quot;general rights,&quot; and exclusion from related actions as well as actions involving the actual subject, would provide a much greater deterrence effect. To refuse standing would be tantamount to giving the police a licence to go fishing for evidence by random stops of automobiles and other searches in the knowledge that evidence can be used against those not directly affected. Ironically, such an incentive would increase the incidence of searches against <i>innocent</i> friends and associates of suspects, resulting in the very intrusion that the
Fourth Amendment and s.8 of the <cite>Charter</cite> were designed to curtail. Particularly in a society in which random stops seem to have a deeply disturbing disproportionate effect on racial minorities, such a licence to search should not be permitted.
<dd>ii) If the purpose of the rule is to <i>avoid bringing into disrepute judicial integrity or the administration of justice</i>, standing should be granted. A violation by the state of someone's rights has occurred, and to refuse standing and admit the evidence would be to condone the violation by acquiescence, regardless of its severity. The Court should balance the factors discussed with regard to s. 24(2) and reach the same result on standing as on the
substantive question as to whether there would be disrepute. Evidence is not less tainted if obtained in violation of another's rights. Indeed, if the defendant was the sole target of the search (as discussed above), then obtaining evidence by deliberately violating an innocent party's rights should bring an even greater taint to the evidence. 
<dd>iii) If the right to a remedy is related to <i>a personal right</i> to be safe from rights violations, one is not necessarily precluded from using the rationales in 2(b)(i) and (ii) to grant standing. In addition, standing can be granted on the basis that one's right to a fair trial has been violated. One could use either the strict test outlined above in <cite>Merkt</cite> and <cite>Fraser</cite>, or a more lenient test such as that used in s. 24(2) generally. In Canada, the latter would be more consistent with s. 24(2) jurisprudence. To determine if the right to a fair trial has been violated under that test, a useful guide is the &quot;but for&quot; test:<sup><a href="#one99">199</a></sup> if the evidence would not have been obtained <i>but for</i> the violation of the third party's rights, it probably renders
the defendant's trial unfair.
</dl>
</ol>
Whatever the rationale chosen, it would seem that standing rules in all three jurisdictions should be opened to potentially include people not directly affected by such searches.
<p>
<h3>V: Alternatives to an Exclusionary Rule</h3>

Judges and commentators alike have explored numerous alternatives to the exclusion of evidence in an attempt to uphold the rights of individuals without imposing the cost on society of excluding clearly probative evidence. Among these suggestions are civil damages aimed at police, reduction in sentences, and contempt citations for rights violators. None of these solutions, however, have been able to avoid the inevitable tradeoff---preventing societal costs in the courtroom means incurring societal costs to the underlying constitutional rights. Letting criminals go is the &quot;`price' our society pays for enjoying the freedom and privacy&quot; that was constitutionally guaranteed.<sup><a href="#twohundred">200</a></sup> As Brennan J. said while dissenting in <cite>U.S. v. Leon</cite>, &quot;it is not the exclusionary rule, but the Amendment itself that has imposed this cost.&quot;<sup><a href="#two01">201</a></sup>
<p>
One question that has often been asked in U.S. jurisdictions is whether the exclusionary rule imposes any
significant cost on society in terms of lost convictions, or has any deterrence effect on police conduct at all. Numerous studies have indicated that there may be relatively low loss of convictions related to the exclusionary rule,<sup><a href="#two02">202</a></sup> but on the whole, the studies seem inconclusive.<sup><a href="#two03">203</a></sup>
Similarly, some studies show a small deterrence effect related to exclusion<sup><a href="#two04">204</a></sup> but
others suggest there is no effect at all.<sup><a href="#two05">205</a></sup> All of these studies are subject to the problems inherent in using statistics to describe trends that could be related to any number of complex social and legal changes, and the results are inconclusive or ambiguous for the most part.<sup><a href="#two06">206</a></sup> Are rising crime rates related to the exclusionary rule, increased violence in the media, increasing unemployment, or more likely to some combination of inter-related factors?  No single statistical study will decide this issue.
<p>
Deterrence of police misconduct can occur both at the level of officer education and briefing, and at the level of police practice in the field. Developments in the law will no doubt be communicated to officers, but changes must also be studied at the ground level. Judicial requirement of warrants has not greatly decreased the number of warrantless searches being conducted, for example.<sup><a href="#two07">207</a></sup> There may be no deterrent effect at all if officers are not in some way affected by failure to comply with the exclusionary rule. Police in some forces
may see their role as mainly to &quot;bring people in,&quot; and blame any problems with the exclusionary rule on the prosecutor's office, as &quot;more administrative red tape.&quot;
<p>
Unless police see themselves as responsible for the lost conviction and feel the hurt, there is little deterrent value in
excluding evidence. Such connection between the rule and police conduct could come through supervision of conduct, and reports on failure to comply with the Constitution.<sup><a href="#two08">208</a></sup> Officers with poor records of upholding constitutional rights in the course of their work should perhaps be subjected to work penalties. Other commentators have suggested more direct penalties, including civil damages.<sup><a href="#two09">209</a></sup>
<p>
CIVIL DAMAGES
<p>
Civil damages as an alternative to the exclusionary rule suffer from several major weaknesses. First, they are reactive, coming into play after the damage to one's rights or freedoms has already been done. More importantly, they come after the damning evidence has been discovered. Once brought to light, the probative value of such evidence carries immense public sympathy and is difficult to override. Second, in light of the probative evidence
found, the public is most likely going to favour the police, who were `just doing their job' in an effort to protect the public. Little juror sympathy is likely for plaintiffs whose guilt seems visible from the evidence discovered. For this reason, even if damages were awarded they would likely be low. Even a trial by judge alone might have similar results.<sup><a href="#two10">210</a></sup>
<p>
REDUCED SENTENCES
<p>
This option, pursued in several Saskatchewan cases,<sup><a href="#two11">211</a></sup> adopts an interesting compromise position. It involves a form of personal remedy, but not exclusion. The cost to society is less than if evidence were excluded, but higher than if sentence were not reduced. It has a much lower deterrence effect,
given that police will still obtain convictions as a result of their actions. In addition, since discretion in sentencing is available to judges in any case, it may be that judges would simply play a numbers game to end up with sentences similar to those the defendant would normally have obtained anyway (start high and then `reduce' to a
normal level).
<p>
In compromising between the various positions, one may lose most of the deterrent effect, retain most of the taint on `judicial integrity,' and abandon the principled basis for the exclusionary rule. Such a solution could only be upheld on principle if the right to a constitutional remedy is a personal one, as suggested by Brennan J. in <cite>U.S. v. Leon</cite>.<sup><a href="#two12">212</a></sup> Whether s. 24(2) guarantees a personal remedy of this sort
is uncertain. One could argue, however, that mitigating on sentence alleviates any taint that would arise from admitting the evidence.
<p>
CONTEMPT
<p>
The benefit of a contempt sanction is that &quot;the courts could directly and efficiently punish the misconduct while at the same time permitting reliable evidence to be used at trial.&quot;<sup><a href="#two13">213</a></sup> This proposal has been supported by many commentators, including Dean Wigmore,<sup><a href="#two14">214</a></sup> as one responsive to the public's interest, both in terms of preventing rights violations and preventing criminals from going free. Difficulties with criminal contempt proceedings include the high burden of proof and the possible reluctance of juries or judges to impose stiff sentences on police officers.<sup><a href="#two15">215</a></sup> Kinasz dismisses standard civil contempt as an impractical remedy, despite its lower burden of proof, because of the indeterminate nature of the penalty, the strain on judicial resources and the questionable deterrent value.<sup><a href="#two16">216</a></sup> Instead, Kinasz proposes a variant of criminal contempt based on a judicial order specifying police duties under the Fourth Amendment.
<p>
Such a judicial order, however, would be most difficult to frame, given the great debate that still surrounds the Fourth Amendment in the United States and the evolution of s. 24(2) in Canada. Most police duties are evaluated <i>ex post</i> on a case by case basis, and attempts to regulate police conduct in advance might fail badly. Alternatively, if the Court sets too flexible a net, it might result in no police misconduct being caught at all.
<p>
Although contempt may deter police conduct, it will not eliminate any disrepute resulting from the admission of evidence into the proceedings. Contempt <i>would</i> provide a form of personal remedy, however, since the particular wrong-doers would be punished directly rather than through indirect deterrence. Such a personal
remedy would be available both to innocent victims of rights violations and culpable ones, unlike the exclusionary remedy which only comes into play with those who are taken to trial. Under the present system, innocent victims have no recourse other than a civil suit, with its many disadvantages and financial costs. As a result, collateral damage to innocent citizens may go unaddressed, limiting deterrence effects considerably.
<p>
IMPLICATIONS
<p>
No matter which of the above remedies is chosen, there will be some costs to society or to the rights of individuals within society. If the justice system admits tainted evidence, it condones the violation. Contempt and damages punish police directly, but they also punish society indirectly in the same way that the exclusionary rule does. If police <i>are deterred</i>, they will not conduct searches in situations that they would have before; as a result,
probative evidence will not be uncovered, and the parties involved will never go to trial, if they are arrested at all.<sup><a href="#two17">217</a></sup> The exclusionary rule, in attempting to return the parties to a world in which <cite>Charter</cite> rights are respected by police, just does in retrospect what deterrence would do in advance. In either situation, convictions will be lost, because as Brennan J. stated, it is the price we pay for the right, not for
the rule.<sup><a href="#two18">218</a></sup>
<p>
The most effective method would likely be a combination of an exclusionary rule with internal police disciplinary regulation related to the treatment of constitutional rights and freedoms. Penal sanctions may be going too far when police in most cases do believe that they are acting in the best interest of society. A more reasonable sanction that retains deterrent force is work sanctions. Relating work sanctions (demotion, re-assignment, suspension, etc.) to
performance of duty, in an atmosphere where constitutional duties are <i>effectively</i> communicated to police forces by an educational officer, would prevent many incidents without putting undue pressure on police forces. It would also capture violations affecting innocent parties rather than just ones who go to trial. The exclusionary rule would serve both as the final screen to protect constitutional rights and as a measure of police performance with regard to those rights.
<p>
<h3>VI: Recommendations and Conclusions</h3>
Although the three jurisdictions differ in terms of their primary justification for the exclusionary rule, four justifications run as undercurrents in each jurisdiction: deterrence of police misconduct, maintenance of judicial integrity, maintenance of the integrity of the justice system as a whole, and the sense that where there is a constitutional right, there should be a remedy. In the United States and New York, deterrence is the primary justification, although New York has strengthened the rule relative to the federal jurisdiction, making it harder to justify exceptions. Elements of a personal right, as advocated by Brennan J. in <cite>Leon</cite>, creep
subtly into the New York decisions but deterrence remains the primary principle, despite its weak constitutional foundation. In Canada, preventing &quot;the administration of justice&quot; from falling into disrepute is the primary principle, one grounded firmly in the text of the Constitution.<sup><a href="#two19">219</a></sup> The right could still be classed as a personal one, however, in that s. 24(2) comes into play after the violation of an individual's rights, and if evidence stemming from that violation would bring the administration of justice into disrepute (discretion of Court), it &quot;shall be excluded&quot; (no discretion).
<p>
All three jurisdictions employ a form of proportionality test in deciding whether or not to exclude evidence, although the tests differ somewhat. In the American jurisdictions, the balance pits deterrence value (which arguably leads to protection of societal rights) against the cost to society of excluding probative evidence. New York, on the basis of its State Constitution, is more reluctant to diminish the deterrence force of the rule by creating more exceptions, but neither jurisdiction explains the balance in great detail.<sup><a href="#two20">220</a></sup> Canadian
courts, on the other hand, expressly balance all or most of the <cite>Collins</cite> criteria in making their decisions, although fairness of the trial seems to be becoming a dominant factor, leading to categorical exclusion if infringed in some contexts.
<p>
Balancing of criteria should be encouraged in Canada, where the Constitution expressly recognizes that rights are not absolute; balancing leads to more flexible laws than absolute rules or exceptions, as the latter can become rigid and arbitrary, unresponsive to contextual differences and the underlying purpose of the constitutional rights. The dangers of judge-made law should be curtailed, however, by clear expressions of principle and overt balancing with an emphasis on coherent reasoning. American courts, working with a more absolute view of rights, may not be able to justify flexible balancing, but should nonetheless be more explicit when balancing is done. No matter what the text of the constitution in question, judges always retain a range of discretion in interpretation, discretion which should be used wisely and scrutinized carefully. Ambiguities should be resolved as much as possible. For example, the definition of what affects fairness of the trial in Canada is left somewhat muddied by the decision in <cite>Mellenthin</cite>, and should be clarified. Distinctions based on the type of evidence discovered should be replaced by concerns with the manner in which evidence was obtained: any evidence which could not have been obtained but for the violation of someone's (not necessarily the accused's) <cite>Charter</cite> rights, should be presumed to affect the fairness of the trial.
<p>
Of all the principles behind the American exclusionary rule, the least compelling theoretically, as well as practically, is the deterrence rationale. The constitutional background for such a rationale is weak at best, whereas there are strong arguments supporting the personal constitutional remedy theory embraced by some members of the Court in <cite>Mapp v. Ohio</cite>.<sup><a href="#two21">221</a></sup> Judicial integrity, as espoused by Brandeis J.<sup><a href="#two22">222</a></sup> and Holmes J.,<sup><a href="#two23">223</a></sup> is less clearly related to the text of the U.S. Constitution but is certainly in line with its spirit. Whatever rationale or rationales are chosen, the application to exclusion law should be internally consistent.
<p>
Standing, therefore, should generally be extended to allow one to contest evidence obtained in violation of constitutional rights, even if the rights violated were those of third parties. A new model of standing, as set out <i>infra</i>, should be developed, emphasizing consistency between a) the substance and purpose of the exclusionary rule; and b) the standing threshold.
<p>
To strengthen the exclusionary rule and dampen criticism of its lack of deterrent effect, the failure to comply with the Constitution should be brought directly home to police forces. Rather than criminal or civil sanctions, however, a mandate should be emplaced to create constitutional education in police forces and tie workplace penalties to failure to comply. Convictions will still be lost, by deterrence of certain searches, but the cost is more than
offset by the greater freedom from unwarranted state interference with constitutional rights.
<p>
Each jurisdiction's exclusionary rule is driven primarily by its underlying constitutional rationale. Insofar as these differ, there may be limits on how much similarity there can and should be in the rule from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Nevertheless, the concerns which arise in one are inevitably felt as currents in the other, though perhaps of different strength. In the end, it seems that the American federal rule is the least exclusionary, the hardest on defendants. Canada, with its balancing, may be more or less exclusionary than New York, although the rejection of a `good faith exception' by New York and the strong weight given to `good faith' by Canadian courts suggest that New York may provide the most protection for its constitutional rights. Of course, only a broad empirical study would resolve this last issue with any certainty. This study can make no hard claims about the relative strengths of the rule in each jurisdiction, because the very nature of the discretionary balancing makes the relation between theory in the cases and practice in the courts difficult to ascertain.

<li><a name="one">The high water</a> mark of categorical exclusion was reached in such cases as <cite>Olmstead v.

In this paper, I shall concentrate mainly, but not exclusively, on the rule's application to the Fourth Amendment.

<li><a name="four">Canadian law, up until the</a> <cite>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite>, was extremely permissive, admitting real evidence and even corroborated parts of confessions that were obtained by flagrant violations of rights: <cite>Queen v. Wray</cite>, [1971] S.C.R. 272. In the United States, such evidence would have been deemed the &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot; (i.e. the fruit of the violation of the right) and excluded, even as early as 1920: <cite>Silverthorne Lumber Co</cite>. v. <cite>United States</cite>, 251 U.S. 385 (1920) [hereinafter <cite>Silverthorne</cite>].
<p>
<li><a name="five">Beginning as far back</a> as <cite>Boyd v. United States</cite>, 116 U.S. 616 (1886) (a civil case), the exclusionary rule came into prominence in <cite>Weeks v. United States</cite> 232 U.S. 383 (1914). The constitutional foundation of the rule was put in doubt in <cite>Wolf</cite>, <i>supra</i> note 1 at 28, 33, but the Court's power to exclude was revived under its supervisory power in <cite>Elkins v. United States</cite>, 364 U.S. 206 (1960) [hereinafter <cite>Elkins</cite>]. With the decision in <cite>Mapp</cite>, <i>supra</i> note 1, the Court outlined a new constitutional basis for its powers, one now threatened.<p>
 Since <cite>Elkins</cite>, the supervisory power (developed in <cite>McNabb v. United States</cite>, 318 U.S. 332 (1943)) as a basis for extending the exclusionary rule to states has been considered and rejected; see B.

<li><a name="fifteen">In the case of</a> <cite>People v. Loria</cite>, 179 N.E.2d 478 at 480 (N.Y. 1961), the Court followed the recent binding decision of <cite>Mapp</cite>, noting that it would have followed pre-existing jurisprudence otherwise. Those earlier cases, beginning with <cite>People v. Adams</cite>, 192 U.S. 585 (1904) and <cite>People v. Defore</cite>, 242 N.Y. 13, <i>cert. denied</i> 46 S.Ct. 353 (1926) [hereinafter <cite>Defore</cite>], held that the manner in which evidence was obtained was not relevant to its admissibility. Justice Cardozo rejected a rule that would mean &quot;[t]he criminal is to go free because the constable has blundered,&quot; because it would give a lowly constable the capacity to
give &quot;immunity&quot; to the most savage criminal (<cite>Defore</cite>, <i>supra</i> at 21--24). In fact, <cite>People v. Richter's Jeweler's</cite>, 51 N.E.2d 690 (N.Y. 1943) expressly states that the state
constitution did not change the law as it was before its adoption, a finding that was effectively overruled by <cite>People v. Johnson</cite>, 497 N.Y.S.2d 618 (1985).

The holding may actually be an attempt to limit the Supreme Court's decision in <cite>R</cite>. v. <cite>Ladouceur,<cite> (1990), 56 C.C.C. 3d) 22 (S.C.C.), another random stop case which upheld random stops as constitutional, even if not part of a R.I.D.E. program.

deter police abuse of random stops, and deterrence is certainly necessary given the evidence that random stops may often affect minority groups in a disproportionate way.

At the level of arrests in California, six per cent of abandoned cases are due to exclusion problems, compared to sixty per cent due to witness/victim problems. At the level of the prosecutor, approximately five per cent are dropped for exclusion reasons. Finally, at trial, 5.6% are dropped due to exclusion reasons. Most (&gt;seventy per cent) of the lost convictions are drug offences, with only six per cent related to burglary, rape, robbery and murder
charges (Fyfe at 256--257). This makes sense if one considers that in drug related offences, the drug evidence seized will be the main foundation of the charge.

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<blockquote>
Securitization is the linchpin for the growth of the real estate asset class.<sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The real estate investment trust (&quot;REIT&quot;) vehicle is a topic of current interest to investors in and portfolio holders of real estate. With the recent decline in real estate values, investors have been frustrated by their inability to exit syndicated real estate investments.<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup> The REIT vehicle affords liquidity. This investment vehicle is, at present, highly regarded as a financial instrument for public institutional ownership of real estate. It is as well an attractive format that enables small investors to participate in the ownership of substantial real estate investments usually available to only corporate or more affluent and sophisticated investors.<sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup>
<p>
A REIT is an entity organized to consolidate the capital of a large number of investors for the purpose of investment in real estate, either through direct equity acquisition or in real estate-secured mortgage loans. As an investment vehicle, the REIT combines the best features of real estate and stocks. It affords the investor a practical and efficient mechanism to include professionally managed quality real estate in an investment portfolio. The REIT investor receives a security, in the form of a share or unit, which entitles the investor to an unspecified proportionate share of the assets in the REIT trust. Most of the U.S. REITs and all of the Canadian REITs trade on a listed exchange.<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup>
<p>
In recent months in Canada and for the last several years in the United States<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup>, REITs have generated considerable attention in the equity and real estate markets. In Canada there has been a recent marked increase in REIT activity and the emergence of portfolio owners interested in forming REITs and investors interested in the purchase of REIT units. This activity is influenced by a variety of factors. The impressive performance of the stock markets in the past few years has renewed investor confidence and interest in public markets. The recent low interest rates have caused REITs to become attractive in terms of current yield.<sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup> The dearth of capital for real estate and the increasing need for asset liquidity has influenced acceptance of this vehicle by developers, property managers and institutional investors. Lastly, favourable tax rules
relating to REITs have resulted in higher after-tax yields.<sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup>
<p>
This paper analyzes the attractiveness of REITs as a vehicle for investing in real estate. It is the author's opinion that, despite the current level of uncertainty in the capital markets, the prospects for the introduction of REITs to the Canadian marketplace are quite promising. As the market trend in real estate finance is shifting from private transactions to public markets, REITs offer an ideal vehicle through which real estate can be securitized and
equitized. Subject to some structural differences, it is anticipated that the development of the Canadian REIT industry will parallel that of the more mature and established U.S. market.
<p>
The topic of real estate securitization raises interesting legal issues in the areas of real estate law, securities law and tax law. As a publicly traded instrument, REITs must comply with securities legislation designed to ensure full, true and plain disclosure in the marketplace. Accurate disclosure of the value of the underlying asset of a REIT is often difficult to quantify due to the lack of liquidity of the underlying real estate assets. Although the real estate properties are appraised on an annual basis, market value cannot accurately be determined except where the real estate is sold in the marketplace. In addition to the issue of liquidity, the value of REIT units will be influenced by prevailing market conditions, investors' acceptance of this form of security instrument and the ability of REITs to generate attractive yields.
<p>
The structure of the REIT has relevant tax implications. Canadian issuers have employed two structures---open-end funds, which provide investors with a right of redemption and closed-end funds, which do not. Depending on the structure selected, the REIT must concern itself with Part XII.2 Tax, a tax levied in connection with trust distributions made to non-residents of Canada, the 21-year deemed disposition rule of capital property held in a trust entity, and different rules relating to Registered Savings Plan eligibility, Capital Cost Allowance, and recapture allocation and land transfer tax. Recent Revenue Canada proposals to amend the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite> provisions relating to REITs should greatly promote their use as a favourable format for the holding of institutional real estate. This paper contains a detailed analysis of the tax rules applicable to the open-end and closed-end REIT structures. 
<p>
Since Canadian REITs are structured as trust entities, they do not, unlike the corporate structure, provide limited liability to the investor. This issue is particularly relevant with respect to environmental matters and, to a much lesser extent, debt exposure. There is risk that the trust, and indirectly the unit holders, could incur general liability for environmental harm. This paper considers this issue and the steps taken by the REIT entity to insulate the investor from exposure to environmental liability.<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup>
<p>
The information in this paper is organized into three parts. Part I examines the nature of a REIT and the characteristics associated with this form of investment vehicle. Part II deals with the public markets for investing in REITs. This section contains a detailed analysis of the benefits and risks associated with this type of investment. Although reference is made to the U.S. REIT market and its history, primary emphasis is given to existing and emerging Canadian REITs. Finally, Part III considers the Canadian tax rules applicable to REITs and, where relevant, legal reform and other significant legal issues are addressed.
<p>
<h3>Part I: Nature of the Real Estate Investment Trust Vehicle</h3>

1. GENERAL DESCRIPTION
<p>
A REIT is an entity that aggregates the capital of many investors to acquire a portfolio of income-producing properties or, in the case of mortgage REITs, to provide financing in the form of real estate-secured mortgage loans. A REIT is similar to a mutual fund that restricts its investments to real estate. A REIT is owned by unit holders who acquire shares, which in the case of publicly-traded REITs, are listed on a major stock exchange.
<p>
REITs provide a suitable investment vehicle for investors of limited financial means who can pool their resources and invest in real estate properties without the major commitment of time and capital required for direct ownership. The investment offers liquidity, especially if publicly traded, and diversification can be achieved through a mixed portfolio of various types of income-producing properties located in different geographic areas.
<p>
REITs are an investment vehicle that originated in the United States initially to overcome restrictions on collective real property ownership and, in due course, to comply with the requirements of the <cite>Internal Revenue  Code</cite><sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup> and other favourable legislation.<sup><a href="#ten">10</a></sup> Canadian tax
law does not contain specific REIT provisions and the applicable provisions of the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite><sup><a href="#eleven">11</a></sup> are not identical to the <cite> Internal Revenue Code</cite>. As a consequence, the features and characteristics of Canadian REITs differ somewhat from their American counterparts. Most of the differences can be attributed to the differences in tax treatment between the two jurisdictions.<sup><a href="#twelve">12</a></sup>
<p>
The term REIT &quot;has been adopted by the Canadian real estate industry to refer generally to a publicly traded, tax-efficient, high yield, low leverage, real estate security.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup> Canadian REITs were initially introduced as closed-end publicly listed real estate investment funds. The underlying concept of a closed-end fund is that the units are not redeemable on demand and are not offered on a continuous basis. Recently, a modified open-end mutual fund trust was to have been introduced to the marketplace. This open-end fund intended to provide for the redemption of units on demand with the modification that such redemption will take place at a pre-specified discount to market value.<sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup> At present, the tax treatment of the open-end vehicle approximates that of U.S. REITs whereas the closed-end real estate investment fund does not.<sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup>
<p>
2.  U.S. REITS
<p>
<i>(i)   Overview</i>
<br>
The REIT vehicle first originated in the 1800's in Massachusetts under the name &quot;Massachusetts business
trust.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup> This alternative form of collective ownership of real estate was created
to avoid state legislative restrictions on collective ownership of real estate for investment purposes. Following the enactment of federal income tax law in the U.S., utilization of the business trust vehicle as a form of collective ownership of real estate accelerated rapidly as U.S. courts consistently held, until 1935, that this trust vehicle did not attract corporate income tax. Use of REITs ended abruptly after 1935 as a result of a United States Supreme
Court ruling that such a business trust was sufficiently similar to a corporation that it should be subject to the same federal taxation rules.
<p>
The current REIT vehicle was created in 1960 as a result of amendments to the U.S. <cite>Internal Revenue Code</cite>. The tax amendments were introduced to enable flow through treatment of real estate income, losses through a business trust, and also to create a mechanism for small investors to access or participate in the ownership of substantial real estate holdings that previously were available by direct acquisition to only large corporate or very
affluent and sophisticated investors. The key feature of the U.S. REIT is that income or capital gains distributed to its shareholders are exempt from federal taxes. In addition, investors retain the benefit of limited liability associated with traditional corporate investments.
<p>
<i>(ii)   Qualifications of U.S. REITS</i>
<br>
To qualify as a REIT for U.S. tax purposes, a number of stringent requirements must be met.<sup><a href="#seventeen">17</a></sup> The extensive requirements of tax, securities and other legislation have resulted in REITs having many common organizational features and characteristics:
<ul>
<li>A REIT must be organized as a corporation, business trust or association and it must be treated as a corporation for tax purposes;<sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup>
<li>Management of a REIT must be carried out by an elected board of directors or trustees.<sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a></sup> In most states, a majority of the directors must be independent;
<li>REITs often employ independent property managers or ground lease their property assets to others, as the tax provisions place limitations on direct management;
<li>A REIT is primarily a real estate entity, as most of its assets must be invested in real estate and most of its gross
income must be generated from rental income or mortgage interest. A minimum of seventy-five per cent of the entity's assets must be invested in real estate with at least seventy-five per cent of the entity's income derived from property rental income or mortgage interest.<sup><a href="#twenty">20</a></sup> No more than thirty per cent of the entity's income may be from the sale of real property held for less than four years or securities held for less than six
months;<sup><a href="#twenty1">21</a></sup>
<li>REIT securities are required to be widely held. Beneficial ownership must be held by at least 100 persons for at
least 335/365th of a taxation year.<sup><a href="#twenty2">22</a></sup> Ownership cannot be concentrated such that more than fifty per cent of the value of the REIT is owned by 5 or fewer individuals.<sup><a href="#twenty3">23</a></sup> This structure promotes a broad base of institutional and non-institutional investment regardless of whether the investors are taxable or tax-exempt;
<li>A REIT must distribute at least ninety-five per cent of its taxable income without regard to capital gains each
year.<sup><a href="#twenty4">24</a></sup> The REIT will only be subject to federal tax at the corporate level on  undistributed income. To the extent that the REIT does not distribute the capital gain on the sale of a property, there are provisions which enable the gain to only be taxed at the investor level;
<li>REITs generally hold income producing, low leverage real estate. REITs are not permitted to speculate on real estate, but rather, must hold their underlying assets for long periods of time;
<li>The investor's interest in a REIT is represented by a security certificate; and
<li>Regardless of whether a REIT is privately or publicly owned, its shares must be freely transferable, often on a
public exchange.
</ul>
<i>(iii)   Characteristics of U.S. REITs</i>
<br>
The resurgence of REIT activity in the U.S. has led to the emergence of a wide variety of new types of REITs, hereinafter identified, which offer increased diversity to the investor community. These new REITs can be categorized by the type of real estate in which they invest and by their structural features. 
<p>
Three basic categories of REITs have evolved in the U.S., characterized primarily by the nature of their underlying
investments.<sup><a href="#twenty5">25</a></sup> <i>Equity REITs</i>, which are the most common form, invest exclusively in equity interests in real estate, through outright ownership of real property interests. The assets of an equity REIT may be <i>diversified</i> or <i>specialized</i> and may be leveraged or unleveraged. <i>Diversified REITs</i> invest in a number of different types of property, in terms of both product type and geographical location, while <i>specialized single-purpose REITs</i> invest in a single property or several properties of the same type (for example, health care facilities).<sup><a href="#twenty6">26</a></sup> <i>Mortgage REITs</i>, as their name implies, invest in mortgage loans secured by real estate. The assets of mortgage REITs include participating mortgages, convertible mortgages, wrap-around mortgages and REITs which own pools of residential mortgages acquired in the secondary market.<sup><a href="#twenty7">27</a></sup> Finally, the assets in <i>hybrid REITs or combination REITs</i> contain a combination of ownership and security interests in various types of real estate. U.S. REITs are also commonly classified according to their particular structural features. These
include:<sup><a href="#twenty8">28</a></sup>
<dl>
<dt><img src = "http://www.law.utoronto.ca/icons/blueball.gif"> <i>Closed-End vs. Open-End</i>
<dd>Closed-end REITs have provisions which restrict the issuance of shares to the initial offering. In contrast, open-end REITs may raise additional capital through the issuance of securities.
<dt><img src = "http://www.law.utoronto.ca/icons/blueball.gif"> <i>Finite-Life vs. Nonfinite-Life</i>
<dd>A finite-life REIT has a predetermined schedule for the sale or liquidation of all the assets and the subsequent distribution of the proceeds to security holders. Conversely, nonfinite REITs have no fixed wind-up schedule or liquidation.
<dt><img src = "http://www.law.utoronto.ca/icons/blueball.gif"> <i>Self-Liquidating vs. Perpetual</i>
<dd>A self-liquidating REIT distributes all cash flow from property sales or financing to security holders as it is collected. In contrast, a perpetual REIT reinvests the surplus proceeds from sales or financing. Both forms must, as is the case with REITs, distribute ninety-five per cent of their taxable income to preserve their REIT status.
<dt><img src = "http://www.law.utoronto.ca/icons/blueball.gif"> <i>Fully Specified vs. Blind Pool</i>
<dd>A fully specified REIT invests only in real property or mortgages permitted by the documents establishing the REIT at the time funds are initially raised. In a blind pool offering, capital is raised first and then suitable investments are determined.
</dl>
One form of REIT which has recently achieved considerable acceptance in the U.S. marketplace is the closed-end, finite-life, self-liquidating, fully specified, equity REIT.<sup><a href="#twenty9">29</a></sup> The benefits from this form of REIT include: increased predictability of returns, as there is no risk of dilution of security holder's interest; a guarantee that security holders will receive the current benefits of property ownership, as all cash flow is distributed; and, the ability of security holders to participate in any appreciation in the portfolio properties on a current basis.<sup><a href="#thirty">30</a></sup>
<p>
3.  CANADIAN REITS
<p>
<i>(i)   Overview</i>
<br>
Problems experienced by existing real estate based mutual funds in late 1992 gave impetus to the emergence of the Canadian REIT industry.<sup><a href="#thirty1">31</a></sup> In Canada, real estate mutual funds have traditionally been structured as mutual fund trusts for income tax purposes.<sup><a href="#thirty2">32</a></sup> While the tax treatment of an open-end mutual fund approximates that of a U.S. REIT (to the extent that the trust entity is not subject to tax when all income and capital gains are distributed on an annual basis), the redemption entitlements inherent in mutual fund trusts gave rise to their demise.
<p>
The redemption provision in mutual fund arrangements, a condition for qualifying as a mutual fund trust, created an
asset/liability mismatch.<sup><a href="#thirty3">33</a></sup> The fundamental problem is that, while the units of the mutual fund trust are highly liquid, the underlying real estate assets can at various times be illiquid. A consequence
of this dichotomy is that mutual fund trusts are obliged to effect sales of their underlying assets in weak real estate markets and/or at disadvantageous prices for the simple purpose of financing unit redemptions. A further complicating problem associated with redemptions was the fact that unit redemption prices were based on the appraised value of the underlying real estate. In unstable markets, appraisals are usually overly optimistic and very often not reliable. As a consequence, the redeeming unit holder is placed in a more favourable position than unit holders whose interests are redeemed upon a liquidation of the trust (where properties are sold at a discount to market value).<sup><a href="#thrity4">34</a></sup>
<p>
The sharp decline in Canadian real estate values during the past several years resulted in an increased demand for redemptions. Whereas prior to the recession, open-end mutual fund trusts could easily satisfy or offset redemption requests by the sale of units, the rapid decline in real estate values compromised the overall solvency of the funds. Rather than liquidate real estate assets at depressed prices in an unstable marketplace, recourse to the redemption feature was suspended and the mutual fund trusts were restructured.
<p>
Those Canadian mutual funds that suspended redemptions include North American Real Estate Fund, Metfin Real Estate Growth Fund and Counsel Real Estate Fund.<sup><a href="#thirty5">35</a></sup> These mutual fund trusts have been converted to REITs. North American Real Fund now trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange as RealFund (symbol RFN.UN), Metfin now trades as Canadian Real Estate Investment Trust or CREIT (symbol REF.UN) and Counsel Real Estate Fund began trading on March 10, 1994 as Counsel Real Estate Investment Trust (symbol REI.UN).
<p>
<i>(ii)   Qualifications of Canadian REITs</i>
<p>
Canadian tax law does not contain specific REIT legislation.<sup><a href="#thirty6">36</a></sup> Notwithstanding the absence of legislation, two REITs emerged in 1993 and one REIT has been introduced in 1994.<sup><a href="#thirty7">37</a></sup> The present objective in forming a REIT is twofold: to create a real estate investment vehicle which has liquidity, and therefore attraction to an investor (as its units are traded on a stock exchange), and to
provide investors with both a return in excess of market interest rates and the potential for capital appreciation.
<p>
In Canada, most REITs are being structured as commercial trusts which are closed-end funds. The closed-end funds do not permit redemption on demand; however, in some cases, the units may be redeemed on demand over a defined period up to established limits.<sup><a href="#thirty8">38</a></sup> Canadian closed-end funds do have shortcomings which include potential tax liabilities and unlimited liability concerns.<sup><a href="#thirty9">39</a></sup>
<p>
A recent advance tax ruling by Revenue Canada<sup><a href="#forty">40</a></sup> with respect to the Lantower REIT's open-end format may have set an important precedent. Revenue Canada ruled that a redemption feature which
allows units to be redeemed at eighty per cent of their current trading price (to be paid in either cash or three-year subordinated debt, at the option of the REIT) be qualified as a mutual fund trust for tax purposes. The tax treatment of this modified open-end mutual fund trust structure approximates that of U.S. REITs and thereby resolves the inherent tax difficulties associated with closed-end funds. There remains, however, the issue of unlimited liability for holders of open-end fund units.
<p>
<i>(iii)   Characteristics of Canadian REITs</i>
<br>
As introduction of REITs in the Canadian marketplace has only recently occurred, it is perhaps premature to identify or speculate as to what combinations of traditional REIT characteristics will emerge in the future. Notwithstanding the foregoing, several common organizational features and characteristics have been identified with Canadian REITs:<sup><a href="#forty1">41</a></sup>
<ul>
<li>REITs pay out all income, the majority of which is sheltered due to capital cost allowance (CCA) and interest deductions inherent in real estate. A REIT is essentially a tax-sheltered yield-producing instrument;
<li>A REIT itself does not pay tax at the fund or trust level. It is a tax-efficient structure for investors wanting the tax shelter opportunities from the CCA and interest deductions;
<li>To date, the Canadian REIT market has focussed exclusively on income property portfolios. These equity REITs contain only income producing, low leverage real estate;<sup><a href="#forty2">42</a></sup>
<li>Primarily as a result of their limited capital base, but also to maximize overall return expectations, REITs have
generally invested in secondary or &quot;B&quot; class properties, as opposed to the more prestigious and expensive &quot;A&quot; class buildings;<sup><a href="#forty3">43</a></sup>
<li>Two of the early Canadian REITs, RealFund and Counsel Real Estate Investment Trust, provide no redemption
provisions. A third, Canadian Real Estate Investment Trust, provides limited redemption rights. Due to the tax benefits associated with the modified open-end structure adopted by Lantower Real Estate Investment Trust, it is anticipated that this structure will become prevalent in the future;
<li>Regardless of whether redemption rights are provided to unit holders, the REIT vehicle is much more liquid than direct investment in real estate or investment in limited partnerships or other syndicated structures. The reason for this liquidity is the fact that REIT units are listed and traded on a major stock exchange. To date, all Canadian REITs are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange; and
<li>In the Canadian market, due to their relatively small size, most REITs will be managed through advisory
relationships. In contrast, the trend in the U.S. has been for REITs to convert to self-advised status.
</ul>
<h3>Part II:   The Market for Investing in REITs</h3>

1.  BENEFITS OF A REIT INVESTMENT
<p>
In addition to their liquidity and the favourable tax treatment afforded to REITs, there are other features associated with this investment vehicle that can make it attractive to investors. For example, REITs:
<ul>
<li>permit portfolio diversification into real estate;
<li>generate attractive after-tax yields;
<li>invest in high quality real estate and contain low debt levels;
<li>are professionally managed; and
<li>are structured efficiently to acquire real estate holdings.
</ul>
<i>(i)   Liquidity</i>
<br>
The ability to divest oneself of a real estate investment is an attractive feature for both large institutional investors and small private investors. As Canadian REITs are publicly traded on a major stock exchange (presently only the Toronto Stock Exchange), investors can easily convert their indirect real estate investment into cash. The lack of capitalization in the marketplace and thin trading volumes may, however, be limiting factors.<sup><a href="#forty4">44</a></sup>
<p>
<i>(ii)   Diversification</i>
<br>
Traditional wisdom suggests that an investment portfolio be balanced and therefore include a real estate component. This theory assumes that real estate provides a hedge against inflation as rents, and therefore values, rise in an inflationary environment.<sup><a href="#forty5">45</a></sup> However, during the current decade, inflation is expected to remain low and, as a consequence of the oversupply of income-producing properties of all categories, effective rental growth is expected to be marginal.<sup><a href="#forty6">46</a></sup> Any material increase in interest rates during this period of oversupply and low inflation will minimize or defeat the hedge value of real estate.
<p>
Current market conditions make real estate investments very attractive. Properties can be purchased at historically high capitalization rates and financed with historically low interest rates.<sup><a href="#forty7">47</a></sup> This combination enables real estate to deliver attractive yields to investors. Many analysts believe that real estate values are now at or near the bottom after an unprecedented five year decline from 1989 to 1993. As a result, the potential for growth in the value of real estate may now exist.<sup><a href="#forty8">48</a></sup>
<p>
The REIT vehicle permits smaller investors (institutional and private) to participate in the real estate investment marketplace and to access top quality substantial real estate properties formerly available only to large institutional investors or more affluent and sophisticated investors who would make direct purchases of such properties. As well, diversification of product acquired by the REIT, through property type and geographical location, will provide
improved risk-return trade-offs.<sup><a href="#forty9">49</a></sup>
<p>
<i>(iii)   Attractive After-Tax Yields</i>
<br>
REITs provide attractive after-tax yields by distributing all income to their unit holders on a periodic
basis.<sup><a href="#fifty">50</a></sup> The existing Canadian REITs distribute operating income on a quarterly basis and realized capital gains on an annual basis. Income from the REIT is generally subject to tax at the investor level and in most cases, little or no income tax liability will arise because of the capital cost allowance (CCA) and interest deductions inherent in real estate.
<p>
The attractive yields from REITs result from the positive net cash flow and appreciation of value of properties within the fund. An increase in yield can be generated either internally or externally. Internal growth can be derived from such factors as increases in rental rates, declining vacancy rates, decreasing interest costs, reducing operating costs and property re-development or expansion.<sup><a href="#fifty1">51</a></sup> External growth is generated primarily by taking advantage of the spread between available returns on the acquisition of real estate and the REIT's current cost of capital.<sup><a href="#fifty2">52</a></sup>
<p>
<i>(iv)   High Quality Real Estate</i>
<br>
Because REITs are essentially a yield instrument, the properties acquired by REITs must produce sufficient rents and, as a consequence, sufficient net income to generate the required yields. Speculative properties, undeveloped properties, raw land and distressed real estate are therefore not appropriate assets for REIT acquisition. Suitable properties are limited to well located, mature, income-producing real estate such as leased shopping centres, high rise residential buildings, and quality industrial and office buildings.<sup><a href="#fifty3">53</a></sup> As a result of
limitations on their capital base and partly as a reflection of overall return expectations, Canadian REITs to date have generally invested in secondary or &quot;B&quot; class properties rather than the more suitable and expensive &quot;A&quot; class properties.<sup><a href="#fifty4">54</a></sup>
<p>
Canadian REITs generally invest in low leverage real estate. They are conservative regarding debt borrowing and usually employ long-term fixed rate debt financing, which is appropriate for the long-term nature of the leases that provide the REITs' cash flow. Most REIT documentation restricts borrowing in excess of a fifty per cent debt to total asset ratio.<sup><a href="#fifty5">55</a></sup> This is substantially less than the seventy-five per cent (or greater) debt to total asset ratio that has been typical of debt levels in the real estate industry.<sup><a href="#fifty6">56</a></sup>
<p>
<i>(v)   Corporate Governance</i><sup><a href="#fifty7">57</a></sup>
<br>
Publicly-held REIT securities enjoy the benefit of professional management, overseen by a board of directors or
trustees. When investors acquire a REIT security, their investment has the benefit of professional management of the underlying assets, and the investor is the beneficiary of fiduciary obligations owing from senior management of the public entity.
<p>
A REIT's performance is monitored on an on-going basis by independent directors of the REIT, independent analysts, independent auditors, and the business and financial media. This scrutiny provides the investor with both a measure of protection and a barometer of the REIT's financial condition and performance.<sup><a href="#fifty8">58</a></sup> A further measure of protection afforded the REIT investor is the market mechanism. Yields and
performance dictate the value of the investor's security relative to other investments. Investors who feel the fund is under-performing may liquidate their interest and invest the proceeds in an alternative investment. The competition between investment alternatives is healthy and, in its own way, should provide stability and afford a REIT investor with a level of protection. 
<p>
<i>(vi)   An Efficient Ownership Vehicle for Real Estate Investments</i>
<br>
In acquiring real estate investments, various legal entities may be used. The common formats include: direct ownership of real property, partnership, co-tenancies, limited partnership structures and direct acquisition of share capital in real estate companies or open-end mutual funds.<sup><a href="#fifty9">59</a></sup> Each of the foregoing have
inherent limitations for those with minority interests. The REIT format appears to be a most efficient format for participation in the ownership of substantial real estate properties, particularly for non-controlling interests.<sup><a href="#sixty">60</a></sup> The limitations referred to are as follows:
<dl>
<dt><i>Direct Investments</i>
<dd><img src = "http://www.law.utoronto.ca/icons/blueball.gif">The types of commercial properties available in
small dollar amounts are limited;
<dd><img src = "http://www.law.utoronto.ca/icons/blueball.gif">Requires property management which is time consuming; and
<dd><img src = "http://www.law.utoronto.ca/icons/blueball.gif">Diversification of investment portfolio is
difficult as significant capital may be tied up in one property.
<dt><i>Partnerships, Co-tenancies, &amp; Limited Partnership Structures</i>
<dd><img src = "http://www.law.utoronto.ca/icons/blueball.gif">Generally sold as tax shelter deals and lack
on-going yield and investment value;
<dd><img src = "http://www.law.utoronto.ca/icons/blueball.gif">Liquidity is limited by the provisions of the
partnership, co-owners or limited partnership agreement; and
<dd><img src = "http://www.law.utoronto.ca/icons/blueball.gif">Typically lack strong asset management.
<dt><i>Common Equity Investments in:</i>
<dt><i>Real Estate Companies</i>
<dd><img src = "http://www.law.utoronto.ca/icons/blueball.gif">Subject to partial double taxation;
<dd><img src = "http://www.law.utoronto.ca/icons/blueball.gif">Typically highly leveraged;
<dd><img src = "http://www.law.utoronto.ca/icons/blueball.gif">Low or non-existent dividend rates; 
<dd><img src = "http://www.law.utoronto.ca/icons/blueball.gif">Often inordinately high administrative and
management fees; and
<dd><img src = "http://www.law.utoronto.ca/icons/blueball.gif">Usually include a large component of
non-income-producing assets, such as land.
<dt><i>Open-End Mutual Funds</i>
<dd><img src = "http://www.law.utoronto.ca/icons/blueball.gif">Very few funds to chose from;
<dd><img src = "http://www.law.utoronto.ca/icons/blueball.gif">The redemption feature is only available in theory
and, as a practical matter, unavailable where there is a material decline in real estate values; and
<dd><img src = "http://www.law.utoronto.ca/icons/blueball.gif">Pricing of units does not always reflect market
conditions.
</dl>
Conversely, REITs are income producing, as a result of the type of real estate they own and the requirement to distribute the majority of their income, tax efficient as CCA and interest deductions flow directly to the investor, liquid, efficiently managed and conservative regarding debt.
<p>
2.  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH REITS
<p>
While there are many advantages to the REIT vehicle, investors must also consider the risk factors associated with REIT ownership. Many disadvantages of a REIT investment are included in the following summary:
<ul>
<li>REITs are subject to the usual risks of real estate ownership;
<li>REITs are exposed to general changes that occur in the public security markets. For instance, trading volumes may be low, dilution may occur for new security issues and unit prices may fluctuate with changes in financial markets;
<li>REITs are a passive form of real estate investment. Potential conflicts of interest arise between REIT
investors and management;
<li>The management of REITs is often dependent on key personnel;
<li>The performance (that is, tax equivalent yield) of REITs may decline over time, as CCA deductions will decrease if additional properties are not purchased to enhance the depreciation pool;<sup><a href="#sixty1">61</a></sup>
<li>Depending on the structure of the REIT, certain adverse tax rules are applicable such as Part XII.2 Tax and Land Transfer Tax (subject to proposed amendments to the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite>);<sup><a href="#sixty2">62</a></sup> and
<li>As Canadian REITs are structured as trusts, they do not offer limited liability.<sup><a href="#sixty3">63</a></sup>
</ul>
<i>(i)   Real Property Ownership</i>
<br>
All real property investments are subject to a certain degree of risk. They are affected by various factors including
general economic conditions, local real estate markets, demand for leased premises, and competition from other available investment opportunities. The value of any income-producing property interest will very much depend on the financial integrity and stability of the tenants. REITs often will be very careful in tenant selection even at the cost of rent maximization.<sup><a href="#sixty4">64</a></sup>
<p>
Real property equity investments are relatively illiquid. This lack of liquidity restricts the REIT from expeditiously making changes to its portfolio in response to changes in economic or investment conditions. In the event a REIT was forced to liquidate material portions of its real estate holdings, the proceeds of disposition may be significantly less than fair market value.
<p>
REITs are exposed to risks associated with debt financing. There is a risk that existing mortgage indebtedness cannot be refinanced, or that financing cannot be obtained on favourable or market terms. The financial strength of the REIT and quality and value of the assets that must be financed are pivotal. To minimize this risk, some REITs will be structured so that the timing for renewal of major tenant leases will coincide with the refinancing.<sup><a href="#sixty5">65</a></sup>
<p>
<i>(ii)   Public Market for Units and Unit Prices</i>
<br>
As REITs have fallen in and out of favour over the years in the U.S. and are only a recent phenomenon in Canada, there is the risk that an active public market for REITs will not develop or will not be sustainable. If trading volumes are low, liquidity will be compromised. In the event of a small market float, larger investors seeking to dispose of real estate security may be obligated to sell the security in small increments to avoid a negative impact on the market price.<sup><a href="#sixty6">66</a></sup>
<p>
One of the significant factors influencing the trading volume of REIT units is yield. Increases in interest rates will prompt potential purchasers of REIT units to demand a higher annual yield causing an adverse impact on the market price of the units. Finally, there is concern that the public markets do not properly value the specific underlying real estate assets and, as a consequence, the securities trade at a discount having regard to fair market value of the real estate assets.<sup><a href="#sixty7">67</a></sup>
<p>
<i>(iii)   Potential Conflict of Interest with Trust and Related Parties</i>
<br>
Various conflict of interest situations may arise as a result of the REIT's management and other related parties being
engaged in a wide range of real estate and other business activities. For instance, where only a percentage interest in a property is owned by the REIT, and the non-REIT co-owner is also engaged as the manager of the REIT, there is an obvious conflict regarding decisions to sell the asset. The manager's personal and/or corporate circumstances, preparedness to forego management fees, and suitability of time for a sale, will conflict with the course of conduct that serves the best interest of the REIT.<sup><a href="#sixty8">68</a></sup>
<p>
The structure of the remuneration schedule for the manager of the REIT contains possible conflicts of interest. In general, the REIT manager will be entitled to an annual management fee based on the adjusted unit holders' equity in the trust, leasing fees, and a percentage fee based on the total acquisition price of any purchase or total disposition price of any sale of real property from the REIT.<sup><a href="#sixty9">69</a></sup> The monetary incentives in place for management to acquire and dispose of real estate may adversely impact the timing of such transactions.
<p>
<i>(iv) Future Performance of REITs</i><sup><a href="#seventy">70</a></sup>
<br>
The future performance of a REIT may be dependent on management's ability to source and acquire quality real estate and effectively administer the assets. The loss of services of talented personnel could adversely affect the REIT. The timely acquisition of assets will also affect the performance of REITs. If additional properties are not acquired from time to time, a decline in pre-tax yields will likely occur as a consequence of erosion of the CCA base
over the years.
<p>
<i>(v)   Legal and Tax Related Risks</i>
<br>
Potential tax exposure and liability concerns are risks attendant upon Canadian REITs. Depending on whether the REIT is structured as an open-end or closed-end investment trust, Part XII.2 Tax<sup><a href="#seventy1">71</a></sup> is levied on non-resident beneficiaries, and Land Transfer Tax<sup><a href="#seventy2">72</a></sup> may be applicable. Because REITs are trusts, they do not offer unlimited liability.<sup><a href="#seventy3">73</a></sup> This issue is particularly relevant with respect to environmental matters as the trust and indirectly the unit holders could be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances, and for general damages that such materials may cause to adjoining properties.
<p>
3.  MARKET PERFORMANCE
<p>
<i>(i)   United States REIT Market</i>
<br>
It is instructive to examine the market performance of U.S. REITs to predict the acceptance of this vehicle in the Canadian marketplace. The present investor interest in REITs can be attributed to a number of factors, including low interest rates which have contributed to high REIT yields relative to other income-oriented investments. The lack of financing from traditional sources has prompted the organization of REITs as an alternative source of funding of investments. In addition, investors foresee a growth opportunity through a secular recovery in the real estate industry.
<p>
The U.S. REIT industry is comprised of approximately 275 REITs of which 186 are publicly traded.<sup><a href="#seventy4">74</a></sup> By far the most common form of REIT is the equity REIT, representing eighty-one per cent of the total industry capitalization.<sup><a href="#seventy5">75</a></sup> The U.S. REIT market is specialized and diversified. There are separate REITs for different property categories---regional shopping centres, community shopping centres, health care facilities, nursing homes, industrial complexes, and even a REIT for mobile homes.<sup><a href="#seventy6">76</a></sup> In addition to property type specialization, some REITs have specialized geographically according to a particular region, state, or city.<sup><a href="#seventy7">77</a></sup>
<p>
The historical performance of REITs in the U.S. over the past twenty years compares favourably to other corporate indices. While all REITs on an aggregated basis underperformed the S&amp;P 500 index by approximately eighty-five per cent, equity REITs actually outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by about twenty-five per cent.<sup><a href="#seventy8">78</a></sup> During the period 1972--1993, equity REITs averaged an annual total return of 14.7% or 170 basis points higher than the S&amp;P 500 index. Further, when accounting for the fact that REITs distribute a much greater portion of their earnings immediately to shareholders, U.S. equity REITs earned on average 410 basis
points over the S&amp;P 500 over this period.<sup><a href="#seventy9">79</a></sup>
<p>
In spite of the positive overall trend, the REIT industry has experienced significant periods of underperformance. We are currently experiencing the third boom in the history of REITs, the previous two being in 1968--1972 and 1985--1986.<sup><a href="#eighty">80</a></sup> These growth periods were followed by significant periods of restructuring in the real estate sector.
<p>
The current boom period has witnessed substantial growth in equity REITs. Over the past two years, 1992 and 1993, $14.8 billion (U.S.) has been raised for equity REITs, $10 billion (U.S.) of which was forthcoming for initial public offerings.<sup><a href="#eighty1">81</a></sup> The size of initial public offerings has increased substantially from $115 million to $195 million on average.<sup><a href="#eighty2">82</a></sup> Despite this phenomenal growth, the REIT
industry remains relatively immature with a market capitalization of $34 billion. To provide some perspective, the capitalization of the entire REIT industry is roughly equal to companies such as General Motors ($45 billion) or Microsoft ($24 billion).<sup><a href="#eighty3">83</a></sup>
<p>   
<i>(ii)  Canadian REIT Market</i>
<br>
<i>(a)   Market Returns</i>
<br>
The Canadian REIT market is in its infancy. As of November 1, 1994, there are three REITs in Canada---RealFund, Canadian Real Estate Investment Trust (CREIT), and Counsel Real Estate Investment Trust. RealFund commenced trading on August 3, 1993, CREIT on September 13, 1993, and Counsel REIT on March 10, 1994. All three of
these REITs trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Together these funds have assets worth $302 million<sup><a href="#eighty4">84</a></sup> and a net asset value of  $246.6 million.<sup><a href="#eighty5">85</a></sup>
<p>
Given the recent emergence of the Canadian REIT market, it is difficult to project market yields for the entire industry. A REIT's distribution is primarily based on cash flow and not earnings. An individual taxpayer is taxed based on the investor's proportionate share of the REIT's net income and the balance of the distribution is treated as a return of capital. The deferral of income tax increases substantially the fully taxable yield equivalent of the equity
REIT.<sup><a href  = "#eighty6">86</a></sup> For example, with a REIT yielding 7.00% on a dividend which represents an eighty-five per cent return of capital, the pre-tax interest yield would be 13.72% (assuming a fifty-three per cent tax rate).<sup><a href="#eighty7">87</a></sup> This yield is substantially greater than several REIT substitutes.
<p>
In Canada, the recent instability in the marketplace, combined with interest rate increases, have adversely affected the share price of the three REITs which currently trade. Consequently, Counsel REIT, RealFund, and CREIT are currently trading at higher yields than originally expected at the time of their equity issues.<sup><a href="#eighty8">88</a></sup> As yield vehicles, REITs are interest rate sensitive, and with the increases in interest rates
in 1994, their prices have correspondingly fallen. All three REITs currently trade at a significant discount to market value. In addition to market uncertainty, the inherent tax liability associated with recapture of CCA in closed-end funds partly accounts for this discount.<sup><a href="#eighty9">89</a></sup> 
<p>
<i>(b)   Market Growth</i><br>
Depending on favourable market conditions, the Canadian REIT market is expected to grow in the next few years.<sup><a href="#ninety">90</a></sup> It was intended that the following REITs would be introduced in the last
half of 1994: Lantower Real Estate Investment Trust, Orlando Real Estate Investment Trust, and Confederation Property Fund. These REITs were to have assets worth approximately $720 million and net assets of  $545 million.<sup><a href="#ninety1">91</a></sup> The market introduction of each of these three REITs has now been
terminated due to unfavourable market conditions.<sup><a href="#ninety2">92</a></sup> Market instability caused by rising interest rates, and investor concern over market performance, led to an investment climate not conducive
to REIT offerings.
<p>
Despite their termination, the conclusions drawn in this paper regarding the open-end REIT format that Lantower REIT was pioneering are still valid. The advanced tax ruling<sup><a href="#ninety3">93</a></sup> obtained by Lantower REIT will serve as a valuable precedent for future REIT offerings. The Canadian REIT market has focused entirely on income-producing portfolios (i.e. equity REITs). The structure adopted by the first three REITs has been the closed-end trust format. In the case of CREIT and Counsel REIT, no redemption rights are granted to unit
holders. RealFund, on the other hand, has elected to provide limited redemption rights at a discount to the trading value of the units, but subject to a monthly cap of $20,000 worth of redemptions.<sup><a href="#ninety4">94</a></sup> One of the terminated REITs was to be structured as an open-end trust vehicle. Lantower REIT intended to provide the unit holder with a right to redeem the unit at a twenty per cent discount to the current trading price, with the proceeds payable in cash or a three-year subordinated debenture at the option of the trust.<sup><a href="#ninety5">95</a></sup>
<p>
It is expected that the Canadian REIT market will grow to a size which will provide ample liquidity. There is a global trend in financial markets towards securitization.<sup><a href="#ninety6">96</a></sup> Canada lags far behind the United States in real estate securitization. The U.S., in turn, is only one-tenth as securitized in commercial real estate as are the U.K. and France.<sup><a href="#ninety7">97</a></sup> Given the Canadian real estate industry's need
to recapitalize and the ability of REITs to provide necessary new capital and liquidity, securitization of the Canadian real estate market is expected to accelerate. There appears to be no shortage of potential issuers of REITs. Public and private real estate companies, financial institutions, governments and corporate owners of large real estate portfolios are all candidates for the marketing of REITs.
<p>
4.  VALUATION OF THE REIT INVESTMENT
<p>
In the U.S. marketplace, the value of a REIT is primarily a function of yield.<sup><a href="#ninety8">98</a></sup> The
yield is measured by dividing the current or following year's projected distributable income by the price of the REIT. To determine distributable income all costs of operating the REIT, including interest, leasing commissions, tenant inducements and structural reserves are deducted from the amount of net operating income. Generally, the CCA and interest costs substantially shelter the distributable income from tax liability.
<p>
The value of a REIT will be derived from the REIT's ability to deliver distributable income on a consistent basis and capital appreciation in the underlying real estate assets.<sup><a href="#ninety9">99</a></sup> Where interest rates are low and there is little expectation of capital appreciation, a REIT's value will be based on yield. Taxable investors will be interested in the pre-tax equivalent yield<sup><a href="#onehundred">100</a></sup>, while the non-taxable investor will focus on pre-tax yield. When interest rates increase, the emphasis will switch to capital appreciation of the underlying assets and, as a consequence, discount or premium to net asset value will be of greater importance to
investors.<sup><a href="#one01">101</a></sup>
<p>
Investors frequently make the mistake of focusing on the dividend yield to the exclusion of the underlying fundamentals of the real estate. Dividend valuation involves more than comparing current payout ratios as high yields may not be sustainable and low yields may not accurately reflect the growth potential in a portfolio.<sup><a href="#one02">102</a></sup>
<p>
In addition to comparing yields and analyzing net asset value, there are additional factors which impact upon the valuation of a REIT. The significant factors include:<sup><a href="#one03">103</a></sup>
<ul>
<li>Quality of portfolio properties;
<li>Quality of management;
<li>Management fees;
<li>Other fund costs;
<li>Level of total debt;
<li>Exposure to interest rate fluctuations;
<li>Exposure to lease roll-overs;
<li>Investment criteria for new properties; and
<li>Amount of cash reserves held by REIT.
</ul>
5.  INVESTORS IN REITS
<p>
Investors generally should have a keen interest in REITs. Taxable investors will be attracted by the fact that REITs generally distribute their income on a quarterly basis and their capital gains annually. This enables the taxpayer to avoid the double taxation that often arises at the conduit level. Investors requiring higher yielding investments or wishing to diversify their portfolio should consider investing in REITs as this vehicle represents a simple and efficient way for smaller investors to gain market exposure to substantial real estate properties.
<p>
In the U.S., larger investors such as pension funds and mutual funds are increasingly investing in REITs. At present, mutual funds and financial institutions are purchasing fifty per cent to seventy per cent of REIT initial public offering shares.<sup><a href="#one04">104</a></sup> Once the market capitalization for Canadian REITs
increases, this trend is expected to be replicated in the Canadian marketplace. In addition to institutional and retail investors, the sponsor or management of the REIT is maintaining a significant ownership position of approximately ten per cent to thirty per cent.<sup><a href="#one05">105</a></sup>
<p>
<h3>Part III: Taxation of REITs and Related Legal Issues<sup><a href="#one06">106</a></sup></h3>

1.  TYPE OF STRUCTURE: OPEN-END VS. CLOSED-END
<p>
It should be recalled from the analysis on the Canadian REIT market contained in Part II of this paper that two structures can be employed---open-end and closed-end funds. The distinguishing feature is whether or not the REIT affords the unit holder the right to require redemption of their units.
<p>
The structure of the fund has relevant tax implications.<sup><a href="#one07">107</a></sup> Should the REIT provide unit holders with redemption rights and satisfy other requisite conditions, it will obtain favourable tax status as a mutual fund trust.<sup><a href="#one08">108</a></sup> Where the right of redemption does not exist or, in the unlikely event that other requisite conditions for qualifying as a unit trust or mutual fund trust are not satisfied, the REIT will be characterized as a commercial trust for tax purposes.<sup><a href="#one09">109</a></sup>
<p>
The structure of the fund also has relevant investor implications. If attendant with redemption rights, liquidity is
available by access to the right of redemption and as well by access to the marketplace. If the REIT does not provide redemption rights, unit holders must rely only on the market to obtain liquidity.<sup><a href="#one10">110</a></sup>
<p>
RealFund and Counsel REIT eliminated all redemption rights when they were converted from mutual fund trusts to REITs.<sup><a href="#one11">111</a></sup> Consequently both REITs will be taxed based on the relevant rules for commercial trusts. CREIT, which was also converted from a mutual fund trust, elected to retain limited redemption rights at a twenty-five per cent discount to the trading value of the units, but subject to a monthly cap of  $20,000 worth of redemptions.<sup><a href="#one12">112</a></sup> It is uncertain whether CREIT will continue to qualify as a mutual fund trust with restrictions on the redemption right in place. The information circular for this REIT is perhaps misleading to the extent it avoids any reference as to whether or not the fund continues to qualify as a mutual fund trust.<sup><a href="#one13">113</a></sup> Since the REIT does not provide unrestricted redemption rights to unit holders, it should not be classified as a mutual fund trust, and therefore should be taxed as a commercial trust. Orlando REIT and Confederation Property Fund, which have been terminated, were structured similar to RealFund and Counsel REIT.
<p>
In contrast to the aforesaid five REITs, the structure of Lantower REIT is innovative and will likely become the preferred structure for future REITs.<sup><a href="#one14">114</a></sup> Lantower REIT was structured to provide a right of
redemption to unit holders, subject to a twenty per cent discount to the trading value of the units with the redemption price to be paid, at the option of the REIT, in either cash or by issuance of three-year subordinated debt.<sup><a href="#one15">115</a></sup> An advanced income tax ruling was obtained from Revenue Canada
which qualified Lantower REIT as a mutual fund trust for tax purposes.<sup><a href="#one16">116</a></sup> Despite the termination of this offering, the conclusions drawn with respect to this &quot;modified&quot; open-end format continue to apply.
<p>
2.  CLOSED-END TRUST STRUCTURE
<p>
<i>(i)   Overview of the Tax Rules</i>
<br>
In Canada, most REITs have been structured as commercial trusts which are closed-end funds. No redemption rights are provided to unit holders. A closed-end REIT (as would a commercial trust) will be subject to the following Canadian tax consequences:
<ul>
<li>Capital cost allowance (CCA) is claimed by the trust entity;
<li>Beneficiaries of the trust are subject to tax on any recapture arising from the sale of property;<sup><a href="#one17">117</a></sup>
<li>Losses incurred by a trust cannot flow through to beneficiaries;<sup><a href="#one18">118</a></sup>
<li>The trust can designate net taxable capital gains in favour of beneficiaries;<sup><a href="one19">119</a></sup>
<li>The preferred beneficiary election is not available to allocate undistributed trust income to beneficiaries;
<li>The 21-year deemed disposition rule will be applicable;<sup><a href="#one20">120</a></sup>
<li>The fund will be subject to tax on any &quot;designated income&quot; under Part XII.2 of the <cite>Act</cite>;
<li>The fund may not qualify as a registered investments for RRSPs, RRIFs and DPSPs;<sup><a href="#one21">121</a></sup>
<li>There is no rollover format available for the transfer of assets to a commercial trust, a unit trust, or a mutual
fund trust;<sup><a href="#one22">122</a></sup>
<li>Purchasers of units on an exchange could potentially be liable for tax if they acquire units from a
non-resident vendor who does not have a certificate indicating that the tax with respect to the sale has been paid;<sup><a href="#one23">123</a></sup>
<li>Income derived from the trust is subject to the alternative minimum tax;<sup><a href="#one24">124</a></sup>
<li>The fund is not subject to capital tax;<sup><a href="#one25">125</a></sup> and
<li>The fund is not subject to large corporations tax.<sup><a href="#one26">126</a></sup>
</ul>
<i>(ii)   Tax Treatment of a Commercial Trust</i>
<br>
The term &quot;commercial trust&quot; is not defined in the <cite>Act</cite>. It is generally used to describe a trust which is not a personal trust. The conditions for a personal trust are set out in subsections 248(1) of the <cite>Act</cite>. Commercial trusts are taxed according to the same rules as ordinary <i>inter vivos</i> trusts,
which are found in subdivision k of Division B in Part I of the <cite>Act</cite>.
<p>
A trust is considered to be an individual for taxation purposes. As the REIT is resident in Canada it will be subject to tax on its income from sources inside and outside Canada.<sup><a href="#one27">127</a></sup> In computing its income (including capital gains), a trust may deduct amounts payable in the year to a beneficiary, subject to limitations with respect to income payable to non-residents.<sup><a href="#one28">128</a></sup> Where income is retained by the trust entity it will incur tax at the top marginal federal rate (that is, twenty-nine per cent) combined with the provincial rate.<sup><a href="#one29">129</a></sup> A trust is not entitled to claim personal credits when computing tax payable.<sup><a href="#one30">130</a></sup>
<p>
<i>(iii)   Tax Treatment of a Beneficiary</i>
<br>
To the extent that income (including capital gains) is paid out or is currently payable<sup><a href="#one31">131</a></sup> to beneficiaries of a trust, the income will be subject to tax in the hands of the beneficiary.<sup><a href="#one32">132</a></sup> The beneficiary of the trust (REIT unit holder) will be required to include REIT payments in income for the year as income from a business or property with the exception of amounts deemed to be a taxable capital gain. A capital gain may also arise where the unit holder sells the REIT unit for proceeds in excess of the holder's adjusted cost base. The beneficiary is taxed on income and taxable capital gains according to their marginal federal rates.<sup><a href="#one33">133</a></sup>
<p>
<i>(iv)   Particular Tax Considerations for Closed-End Structures</i>
<br>
<i>(a)   Capital Cost Allowance and Recapture</i>
<br>
Capital Cost allowance<sup><a href="#one34">134</a></sup> (CCA) is claimed at the trust level. The REIT will be
entitled to deduct CCA with respect to any depreciable property held within the year. As REITs predominantly own real property interests, the applicable CCA rates are four per cent or five per cent, depending on whether the property is a class one or class three asset.<sup><a href="#one35">135</a></sup> A trust is subject to the rental property restriction in that it cannot use CCA to offset other rental income of beneficiaries.<sup><a href="#one36">136</a></sup> A trust may annually take CCA on the undepreciated capital cost (UCC) base<sup><a href="#one37">137</a></sup> of the property to the lesser of the maximum prescribed rate or the amount of income generated by the property.<sup><a href="#one38">138</a></sup>
<p>
By way of contrast, a mutual fund trust (or open-end REIT) is entitled to designate a portion of its inherent tax liability for recaptured CCA<sup><a href="#one39">139</a></sup> to unit holders who are redeeming their units.<sup><a href="#one40">140</a></sup> However, in the case of closed-end structures that trade on an exchange, there is no mechanism to pass on the deferred liability to unit holders who sell their units. The inherent tax liability within the fund for recaptured CCA will simply continue to accumulate and may or may not be reflected in the price at which the units will trade on an exchange. This represents a latent liability which may impact a purchaser of units without the
investor's knowledge.
<p>
<i>(b)   21-Year Deemed Disposition Rule</i>
<br>
To prevent the accumulation of capital in a trust on a tax-free basis, there is a notional deemed disposition of all capital property every 21 years.<sup><a href="#one41">141</a></sup> The accrued gain will be subject to tax within the trust at the top marginal rate.<sup><a href="#one42">142</a></sup>  The 21-year rule, although applicable to commercial
trusts, does not apply to unit trusts or mutual fund trusts.
<p>
The 21-year period may be calculated from the date that the fund was first created and not from the date that the fund ceased to qualify as a unit trust or mutual fund trust. This may be disadvantageous to those REITs, such as RealFund, CREIT and Counsel, which were formerly structured as open-end real estate mutual fund trusts.<sup><a href="#one43">143</a></sup> It should be noted that the impact of a deemed disposition of assets may not be harmful if none of the fund's properties have in fact appreciated in value.
<p>
<i>(c)   Part XII.2 Tax</i>
<br>
A closed-end trust is liable for Part XII.2 tax, which is a tax on designated income on certain trusts, unless it can certify that during the year none of the unit holders were &quot;designated beneficiaries.&quot;<sup><a href="#one44">144</a></sup> The legislation defines a &quot;designated beneficiary&quot; of a trust as a non-resident or non-taxable investor who acquires a unit from a taxable investor.<sup><a href="#one45">145</a></sup> Part XII.2 tax is
levied at a rate of thirty-six per cent on the trust's &quot;designated income,&quot; which includes income from real property and capital gains arising from the disposition of Canadian property.<sup><a href="#one46">146</a></sup>
<p>
As a result of taking capital cost allowance, most existing Canadian REITs do not anticipate having any designated income in the short term.<sup><a href="#one47">147</a></sup> However, if a fund does incur Part XII.2 tax, taxable Canadian resident beneficiaries are permitted to claim their <i>pro rata</i> share of the tax paid by the fund as a credit against their ordinary tax obligation, whereas non-resident beneficiaries would not receive any credit. Certain tax-exempt entities may claim a similar refund for the Part XII.2 tax paid. In reality, for Canadian residents, Part
XII.2 tax simply represents a timing difference, as most unit holders can claim a credit in computing their annual or quarterly tax liability equal to their proportionate share of the Part XII.2 tax the REIT has paid.
<p>
All the existing Canadian closed-end REITs contain provisions prohibiting non-resident unit holders.<sup><a href="#one48">148</a></sup> However, as a practical matter, a REIT is a publicly traded vehicle and it is virtually impossible to ensure that the fund does not become tainted by &quot;designated beneficiaries.&quot;  The existing closed-end REITs are currently indemnifying new unit holders who participate in their special warrant issues against Part XII.2 tax for approximately two years.<sup><a href="#one49">149</a></sup> Recent proposed amendments to the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite>, introduced on 27 May 1994, appear to resolve this issue.<sup><a href="#one50">150</a></sup>
<p>
<i>(d)   Registered Savings Plan Eligibility</i>
<br>
In contrast to mutual fund trusts, the closed-end REIT structure must qualify as a registered investment under Part X.2 of the <cite>Act</cite>.<sup><a href="#one51">151</a></sup> The fund must meet the following  qualifications:<sup><a href="#one52">152</a></sup>
<ul>
<li>the fund must have a sole corporate trustee who is licensed under federal or provincial laws to carry on a business as a trustee;
<li>the fund must not have less than 20 beneficiaries which are either RRSPs or RRIFs;
<li>at least eighty per cent of its property (measured by fair market value at the time of acquisition) must be
held in shares, bonds, mortgages, marketable securities, cash or equity in real property held for the purposes of producing income;
<li>the value of any share, bond, mortgages or other securities of any one corporation or debtor (excluding
government debt) must not exceed ten per cent of the fair market value of all its properties in excess of debt owing on account of the acquisition of real property;
<li>the fair market value at the time the acquisition of any one real property less any debt owing on account
of the acquisition of such property must not exceed ten per cent of the fair market value of all properties; and
<li>not less than ninety-five per cent of income must be derived from the investments described in (c) above.
</ul>
The requirements for a closed-end fund to be eligible for a registered savings plan (RSP) are stringent and must be satisfied on an on-going basis. All the Canadian REITs except Lantower must satisfy the conditions for being a &quot;registered investment&quot; in order to retain their RSP eligibility. In the case of Lantower REIT, it is
structured as a mutual fund trust and would thereby qualify as a registered investment.<sup><a href="#one53">153</a></sup> Recent proposals by Revenue Canada will enable real estate trusts to qualify as mutual fund trusts and, therefore automatically qualify as RSP eligible investments.
<p>
<i>(e)   Dispositions by Non-Residents</i><sup><a href="#one54">154</a></sup>
<br>
Units of a closed-end structure do not qualify as &quot;excluded property&quot; for the purpose of section 116 of the <cite>Act</cite>. The units will constitute taxable Canadian property, with the result that any non-resident vendor would be required to obtain a certificate indicating that taxes either have been paid or arrangements to pay are in place prior to the sale.<sup><a href="#one55">155</a></sup> Any purchaser of units on an exchange is potentially subject to liability if the vendor has not obtained the certificate, unless, after reasonable inquiry, the purchaser had
no reason to believe the vendor was not resident in Canada.<sup><a href="#one56">156</a></sup> As a consequence of this potential liability, all the Canadian REITs that are structured as closed-end funds prohibit non-residents from legally or beneficially owning units.<sup><a href="#one57">157</a></sup>
<p>
<i>(f)   Provincial Land Transfer Tax</i><sup><a href="#one58">158</a></sup>
<br>
If a fund owns real property in Ontario and ceases to qualify as a mutual fund trust, then a transfer of units would no
longer be exempt under the current provisions of the <cite>Land Transfer Tax Act</cite> (Ontario). The sale of a closed-end real estate trust unit is considered to be a transfer of a beneficial interest in real estate and is subject to land transfer tax.
<p>
This tax would be very difficult to administer as units freely trade on an exchange and buyers and sellers are unknown. As a practical matter, enforcement appears impossible. The tax is not being paid on transfer and the taxing authorities do not appear to be monitoring this issue.<sup><a href="#one59">159</a></sup>
<p>
3.  OPEN-END REIT STRUCTURES
<p>
<i>(i)   Overview of the Tax Rules</i>
<br>
To date, only one Canadian REIT, Lantower, was structured so as to qualify as a mutual fund trust for taxation
purposes.<sup><a href="#one60">160</a></sup> Mutual fund trusts are given favourable tax treatment in the following respects:
<ul>
<li>A mutual fund trust is not taxable if it distributes all income and capital gains annually, provided that
appropriate designations are made;
<li>Tax paid on capital gains of the trust will be refunded as units are redeemed;<sup><a href="#one61">161</a></sup>
<li>Capital gains of the trust can be designated as capital gains of non-resident beneficiaries;<sup><a href="#one62">162</a></sup>
<li>The units are qualified investments for RRSPs, RRIFs and DPSPs;<sup><a href="#one63">163</a></sup>
<li>The 21-year deemed disposition rule is not applicable;<sup><a href="#one64">164</a></sup>
<li>Part XII.2 tax, which gives rise to a thirty-six per cent tax on designated income (real estate income and
capital gains) does not apply to a mutual fund trust;<sup><a href="#one65">165</a></sup>
<li>Units of mutual fund trusts are exempt from land transfer tax;<sup><a href="#one66">166</a></sup>
<li>Units of mutual fund trusts are excluded property for the purposes of the certificate requirements under
section 116 for dispositions by non-residents;<sup><a href="#one67">167</a></sup>
<li>Income received from the trust is not subject to the alternative minimum tax;<sup><a href="#one68">168</a></sup>
<li>The fund is not subject to capital tax;<sup><a href="#one69">169</a></sup> and
<li>The fund is not subject to large corporation tax.<sup><a href="#one70">170</a></sup>
</ul>
<i>(ii)   Qualifications for a Mutual Fund Trust</i>
<br>
A mutual fund trust is a specific form of unit trust.<sup><a href="#one71">171</a></sup> The basic requirement of a unit trust is that it be an <i>inter vivos</i> trust, having the interest of each beneficiary described by reference to units of the trust.<sup><a href="#one72">172</a></sup> In the case of an open-end unit trust, there must be conditions attaching to the units, requiring the trust to accept, at the demand of the unit holder, the surrender of the unit. At least ninety-five per cent of the fair market value of the units must be redeemable or retractable based on the appraised value of the assets.<sup><a href="#one73">173</a></sup>
<p>
A mutual fund trust must be a unit trust which satisfies several additional conditions. The trust must be resident in Canada. Its undertaking must be limited only to the investing of funds of the trust and dispersal of ownership of its units. Public trading of the units must comply with conditions prescribed by regulation.<sup><a href="#one74">174</a></sup> The prescribed conditions require the trust to have issued units to the public pursuant to a prospectus or similar procedure, and to have a minimum of 150 unit holders each owning one block of units with an aggregate fair market value of at least $500.<sup><a href="#one75">175</a></sup>
<p>
<i>(iii)   Tax Treatment of Mutual Fund Trusts</i>
<br>
Subject to certain exceptions, the rules governing the determination of income (including capital gains) and taxable income of a unit trust (and therefore, a mutual fund trust) are the same as those applying to ordinary trusts.<sup><a href="#one76">176</a></sup> The exceptions are that the 21-year deemed disposition rule of capital property is made expressly inapplicable and a unit of a unit trust will generally be treated as capital property, analogous to the share of a corporation, in order to avoid difficulties on the sale of transferable units.<sup><a href="#one77">177</a></sup>
<p>
Similar to other types of trusts, to the extent that income (including capital gains) is payable in the year to beneficiaries, subject to exceptions involving non-resident unit holders and designated beneficiaries, it is taxed in the hands of the individual and not the trust.<sup><a href="#one78">178</a></sup> There are flow-through provisions which enable capital gains and capital cost allowance to pass through to the beneficiaries. With mutual fund trusts, capital gains that are not distributed in the year in which they are earned cannot be subsequently distributed other than by redemption of units in order to recover the tax paid at the trust level on such gains.<sup><a href="#one79">179</a></sup>
<p>
To the extent that income (including capital gains) is retained in the trust, it is subject to a flat rate of tax equal to the top federal marginal rate of twenty-nine per cent.<sup><a href="#one80">180</a></sup> When provincial taxes of fifty-eight
per cent are included, the overall rate of tax levied on income in the trust is 45.8% (ignoring surtaxes). A trust is not entitled to claim personal credits when computing the tax payable.<sup><a href="#one81">181</a></sup>
<p>
<i>(iv)   Tax Treatment of Unit Holders</i>
<br>
To the extent that income (including taxable capital gains) of a unit trust, including a mutual fund trust, is currently
distributed or currently distributable,<sup><a href="#one82">182</a></sup> it will not be subject to tax in the hands of the trust but rather, will be treated as income of the particular unit holder.<sup><a href="#one83">183</a></sup> A unit holder would be required to include this amount in his income for the year from a business or property except any amount deemed to be a taxable capital gain. The taxable capital gains of the individual are aggregated and offset against any accumulated capital losses before being subject to tax. A capital gain can also arise when the unit holder disposes of a unit for proceeds of disposition in excess of the unit's adjusted cost base. The income and the net taxable capital gain (that is, three-quarters of capital gains less accumulated capital losses) will be subject to tax at the individual's marginal rate.<sup><a href="#one84">184</a></sup>
<p>
Non-residents are permitted to own mutual fund trust units. Distributions of income by a resident trust to a non-resident unit holder are subject to withholding tax of 25% (subject to Treaty deduction).<sup><a href="#one85">185</a></sup> If, however, the distributed amount is deemed to be a taxable capital gain of the non-resident unit holder, no withholding tax will be imposed.<sup><a href="#one86">186</a></sup> Where a non-resident unit holder owns less than twenty-five per cent of the issued units in the five years prior to disposition, the unit will not constitute taxable Canadian property, and therefore, no withholding tax is exigible on the proceeds of the sale.<sup><a href="#one87">187</a></sup>
<p>
4.  SELECTING BETWEEN OPEN-END AND CLOSED-END STRUCTURES
<p>
In addition to tax implications associated with the REIT structures, there are significant business issues that must be
considered prior to selection of the appropriate structure. The choice of structure involves various trade-offs. Where a closed-end trust structure is utilized, REITs do not offer a right of redemption to unit holders. The liquidity that arises from a closed-end REIT will be solely derived from the market. To the extent that trading volumes are thin, liquidity will suffer. Open-end or modified open-end trust structures afford the unit holder the right to redeem
the security. This affords the unit holder additional liquidity beyond that offered by the market. However, to protect the REIT from the risk of becoming insolvent, which may arise as a result of recourse to redemption rights in a concentrated time frame by a substantial number of unit holders, the REIT builds in a mechanism whereby redemption occurs at a steep discount to market value. As an added protective measure, the REIT may wish to specify the form of payment as being either cash or a subordinated debenture of a specified duration, to be determined at the option of the REIT. The steep discount and the ability to specify the timing of and form of
payment will discourage unit holders from exercising their redemption rights, and will therefore impact on the liquidity of the unit. Inclusion of an unrestricted redemption feature (the open-end structure) affords investors a more favourable income tax treatment.
<p>
Ignoring the different tax implications of the two REIT structures, issuers will prefer the closed-end structure as it denies investors the right to require the issuer to redeem their shares. Investors in closed-end REITs must resort to the marketplace to sell their securities. Investors will clearly prefer the open-end structure as it affords them additonal liquidity, since they may sell their shares in the marketplace or exercise their right of redemption and require the issuer to purchase their shares.
<p>
5.  UNLIMITED LIABILITY CONCERN<sup><a href="#one88">188</a></sup>
<p>
Since Canadian REITs are structured as trust entities, they are not afforded the limited liability benefits that are commonly associated with U.S. REITs or Canadian corporations. The inability to offer limited liability gives rise to investor risk, predominantly with environmental issues and, to a much lesser extent, debt exposure.<sup><a href="#one89">189</a></sup>
<p>
Environmental and ecological legislation and policies have become more prevalent and onerous in recent years. Under various federal and provincial legislation, the REIT could become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on or in its properties, and at common law, for consequential general damage to adjoining property owners. Failure to remove or remediate such substances will adversely impact the owner's ability to sell the real estate or borrow using the real estate as collateral and further, could potentially result in financial damage claims against the owner.
<p>
To protect the unit holders, all Canadian REITs carry environmental insurance.<sup><a href="#one90">190</a></sup> Prior to acquisitions of real estate or conversion to a REIT status, Phase One environmental assessments (which are an
&quot;unintrusive&quot; initial analysis of environmental problems) are performed as a precautionary measure.<sup><a href="#one91">191</a></sup> Depending upon the use provisions, new leases require tenants to carry adequate environmental insurance. In addition, the management of REITs have commenced the practice of periodic
inspections of tenant premises where the tenant's use of the premises or lands adjacent thereto may subject the property to environmental contamination or harm.
<p>
Personal liability may also arise with respect to contractual obligations of the trust. The possibility of this liability arising is remote as most of the REITs' obligations arise by contract, and non-contractual risks are generally insurable. Furthermore, REITs minimize their liability to unit holders through the use of non-recourse debt.<sup><a href="#one92">192</a></sup>
<p>
6.  PROPOSED INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS
<p>
Although Canada does not have specific REIT legislation, sustained lobbying activity by the Canadian Institute of Public Real Estate Companies (CIPREC) on behalf of many large financial institutions such as pension funds, life insurance companies, trust companies, and banks has influenced Revenue Canada to propose minor changes to the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite>. These changes will clarify certain issues and remove certain ambiguities affecting Canadian REIT structures. This proposal would provide for a &quot;clean&quot; closed-end REIT structure and would obviate the need for enactment of specific REIT legislation.
<p>
The Finance Department of Canada, in a <cite>News Release</cite> dated 27 May, 1994, announced proposed changes to the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite> that would facilitate the holding of real estate investments by
mutual fund trusts.<sup><a href="#one93">193</a></sup> Under the existing income tax provisions, a real estate trust
cannot qualify as a mutual fund trust unless the trust allows for the redemption of its units by  unitholders.<sup><a href="#one94">194</a></sup> The proposed changes would permit real estate trusts whose units are publicly traded to qualify as mutual fund trusts.
<p>
Under subsection 108(2), there are two ways to qualify as a unit trust, which is a prerequisite to qualifying as a mutual fund trust. First, where the shares have a right to redeem, such as in the case of the open-end REIT structure, the security will qualify as a unit trust.<sup><a href="#one95">195</a></sup> Alternatively, shares which do not permit
a right to redeem may still qualify as a unit trust provided they hold certain specified assets.<sup><a href="#one96">196</a></sup> The proposed changes to the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite> entitle a closed-end trust to now hold real property situate in Canada, provided at least eighty per cent of the real property is located in Canada, and qualify as a mutual fund trust without having to offer the investor a right of redemption.
<p>
It is expected that this legislation will be enacted sometime in 1995. Institutions planning to market a REIT cannot obtain an advanced income tax ruling as to the tax status of their offering since the legislation has not been enacted. Revenue Canada is, however, prepared to provide an opinion that the foregoing changes will be introduced and will have the aforementioned effect on the tax status of the offering. Because of the present uncertainty, parties intending to issue a REIT may decide to delay their introduction until these changes are enacted so as to avoid a temporary interim period when the closed-end fund does not qualify as a mutual fund trust.<sup><a href="#one97">197</a></sup>
<p>
As previously noted, there are favourable tax implications that are associated with the mutual fund trust status. The closed-end REIT will now be exempt from Part XII.2 tax, a tax levied in connection with trust distributions made to investors not resident in Canada. The 21-year deemed disposition rule will not apply to a mutual fund trust. Finally, units of a mutual fund trust automatically qualify as eligible investments for retirement savings plans. Unfortunately the issue of unlimited liability of unit holders still remains, although the risk of exposure can largely be minimized.
<p>
<h3>Concluding Remarks</h3>

The history of REITs in the U.S. marketplace will offer guidance and a valuable framework for the development of this vehicle in Canada. The recent increased popularity of REITs among both investors and issuers represents a fundamental shift in the way substantial quality real estate is owned and financed. The REIT vehicle offers the investor liquidity, and also provides attractive yields, the opportunity for growth, and permits large and small
investors to access the real estate market sector. From the issuers' perspective, REITs represent an efficient form of equity financing as many traditional sources of capital for real estate have retrenched. For some issuers, REITs represent a vehicle to enable issuers to sell assets for cash or minimal financing in circumstances where direct or
indirect future benefit is derived from such assets through receipt of management fees pursuant to arrangements with the REIT.
<p>
It is the general conclusion of this paper that REITs have the potential to become a key feature in Canada's real estate and capital markets. The same factors influencing acceptance in the U.S. marketplace---need for equity, need for liquidity and search for higher yields by investors---prevail in Canada. Small investors collectively represent an enormous capital pool. The REIT mechanism enables small investors to now enter the securitized real estate marketplace.<sup><a href="#one98">198</a></sup> REIT issuers and the security industry in general have their own incentive to tap this capital pool. 
<p>
The recently proposed amendments to the <cite>Income Tax Act</cite> which, in effect, sanction a &quot;clean&quot; closed-end REIT structure will greatly encourage the use of the REIT format for the holding of
institutional real estate. As a result of the proposed legislative reform, the closed-end REIT structure should emerge as the preferred structure.
<p>
Market acceptance of the REIT vehicle in Canada will also depend on the liquidity in the capital markets and on the REIT's ability to generate sufficient growth to provide investors with a risk-adjusted total return sufficient to compensate for the inherent equity risk.<sup><a href="#one99">199</a></sup> As the number of REITs introduced to the marketplace increases, there is added risk that the lack of market reception or very poor performance of one REIT may, in the short run, taint the entire investment class.

<h1>Restitution, `Passing On,' and the Recovery of Unlawfully Demanded Taxes: Why <b>Air Canada</b> Doesn't Fly<p>
PAUL MICHELL</h1>

<center><h3>ABSTRACT / <a  href="http://www.law-lib.utoronto.ca/law-review/utlr53-1/michell.htm">Fulltext</a></h3></center>

There is an emerging doctrine in the law of restitution that taxes paid under an unlawful statute may be
recovered as of right.  The Supreme Court of Canada has been reluctant to fully accept this principle, however.  In <cite>Air Canada v. British Columbia</cite>, and in <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines v. British Columbia</cite>, the Court accepted a `passing on' defence.  The defence allows public authorities to argue that any enrichment they received in the form of taxes did not come at the expense of the taxpayer, because it `passed on' the cost of taxes so paid to its customers.  More recently, lower courts have disagreed over the proper scope of the `passing on' defence.  The author argues that the `passing on' defence should not be accepted, because it is inconsistent with the law of unjust enrichment, it reduces the ability of commercial taxpayers to recover tax payments from public authorities, thus undermining important constitutional principles, and it is economically misconceived.  The better approach is to refuse the `passing on' defence, but in some cases to require a commercial taxpayer to hold any moneys recovered on constructive trust for those of its customers who paid the tax.
<p>
Une tendance &eacute;merge dans le droit de la restitution selon laquelle les taxes acquitt&eacute;es en vertu d'une loi ill&eacute;gitime peuvent &ecirc;tre r&eacute;cup&eacute;r&eacute;es &agrave; titre de droit.  La Cour supr&ecirc;me du Canada a tout de m&ecirc;me h&eacute;sit&eacute; &agrave; accepter compl&eacute;tement ce principe.  Dans les arr&ecirc;ts <cite>Air Canada c. Colombie-Britannique</cite> et <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines c. Colombie-Britannique</cite>, la Cour a accept&eacute; une d&eacute;fense selon laquelle l'enrichissement dont a b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute; le gouvernement s'est fait au d&eacute;triment de tiers parties et non au d&eacute;triment des plaignants.  Ce moyen de d&eacute;fense permet aux autorit&eacute;s publiques de soutenir que tout enrichissement re&ccedil;u sous la forme d'une taxe n'&eacute;tait pas aux d&eacute;pens du contribuable, puisque ce dernier a fait supporter le fardeau des taxes ainsi acquitt&eacute;es &agrave; ses clients. R&eacute;cemment, les juridictions inf&eacute;rieures se trouvaient en d&eacute;saccord sur le domaine d'application de ce moyen de d&eacute;fense. L'auteur soutient que cette d&eacute;fense ne devrait pas &ecirc;tre accept&eacute;e, car elle est incompatible avec le droit de l'enrichissement injustifi&eacute;; elle diminue la capacit&eacute; des contribuables commerciaux de r&eacute;cup&eacute;rer des autorit&eacute;s les taxes pay&eacute;es, minant ainsi certains principes constitutionnels importants.  De plus, elle serait mal con&ccedil;ue du point de vue &eacute;conomique.  La meilleure approche est de rejeter ce moyen de d&eacute;fense, et d'exiger dans certains cas d'un contribuable commercial qu'il garde toute somme re&ccedil;ue en fiducie par interpr&eacute;tation pour les clients qui ont acquitt&eacute; la taxe.

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

The legal framework regulating the recovery of taxes paid under an unlawful statute has recently undergone a major upheaval. The main thrust of these developments has been welcome: there is an emerging rule mandating the recovery of taxes paid under an unlawful statute. Yet there is concern that this nascent rule will be undermined by the ill-considered adoption of particular defences to such claims for recovery. The taxpayer's suit against the government is an important testing ground for the general principle of unjust enrichment<sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup> The subject has been under discussion for decades in Canada.<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup> Regrettably, the considerable optimism which has accompanied the more general development of the law of restitution in Canada must be dimmed on this point. The Canadian law with regard to the
recovery of taxes paid under an unlawful statute is unsatisfactory, due in large measure to the Supreme Court of Canada's ambiguous acceptance of the `passing on' defence.<sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup>
<p>
According to its adherents, the `passing on' defence may be advanced by a public authority when sued by a taxpayer in unjust enrichment. In the paradigm case, the plaintiff is a firm which has made tax payments to a government. The legal authority requiring such payments is later declared to be unlawful (that is, <i>ultra vires</i>, unconstitutional, or misapplied).<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup> The plaintiff then brings a suit seeking
restitution of its money. The public authority argues that it would not be unjust for it to retain the tax payments because although the plaintiff paid the taxes, it `passed on' the cost of doing so to its customers in the form of higher prices. It is argued that it would be unjust to order the return of the taxes to a plaintiff who has recovered fully from its customers. In effect, the plaintiff would be awarded a windfall. At first blush, the defence may carry some
intuitive appeal. This initial impression must be resisted. More careful analysis demonstrates that in most instances the `passing on' defence should not be recognized for three reasons. First, the `passing on' defence is founded on a misunderstanding as to the nature of the unjust enrichment principle. Second, an uncritical acceptance of the `passing on' defence threatens the courts' acceptance of a broader constitutional principle requiring public
authorities to return tax payments collected without lawful authority. Finally, the `passing on' defence is based on unsound economic reasoning. The `passing on' defence is bad law and unsound policy.
<p>
An explanation of the problem cannot be divorced from an account of more general developments in the law of restitution. After much temporizing,<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup> the common law world has now largely accepted that unjust enrichment forms a unified category of civil obligation distinct from tort and contract.<sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup> Canadian<sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup> and Australian<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup> courts played a vanguard role in the assertion of a general principle of unjust enrichment, and there can be no doubt that unjust enrichment is now recognized as a principle in Canadian law.<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup> For the most part, Canadian courts make use of a broad conceptual framework so that the
law of restitution may unfold in an ordered and incremental fashion.<sup><a href="#ten">10</a></sup> The danger is that the law governing the recovery of unlawfully collected taxes is out of step with more general developments in the law of restitution. In the past three years, there have been rapid developments in the law of restitution in England, with the belated judicial recognition of a general principle of unjust enrichment.<sup><a href="#eleven">11</a></sup> The English law, after years of denial, has now vaulted ahead of the Canadian law.
<p>
In a landmark decision, <cite>Woolwich Equitable Building Society</cite>,<sup><a href="#twelve">12</a></cite> the House of Lords established a general right to restitution of taxation payments made to a public authority under <i>ultra vires</i> regulations.<sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup> A building society (&quot;Woolwich&quot;) had made a tax payment of almost $57 million to the Revenue under protest. Woolwich argued that the demand for the payment was <i>ultra vires</i> and thus void. Woolwich sought judicial review of the tax regulations, and it was determined by the House of Lords that the regulations had been <i>ultra  vires</i>.<sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup> The Revenue then decided to return the full amount of tax which had been paid. However, the Revenue argued that this repayment had been made at its discretion alone, that Woolwich had no right to this repayment, and resisted paying interest on the $57 million. Woolwich brought an action in unjust enrichment in order to establish that it had a right to repayment of the taxes, so that the Court could award interest on the money (which amounted to some $6,730,000) in addition to the return of the initial sum. The majority of the House of Lords upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal that Woolwich was entitled to recover the tax payment as of right, and thus, with interest.<sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup>
<p>
<cite>Woolwich Equitable Building Society</cite> is a revolutionary decision, remarkable for its ambition and refreshing in its willingness to advance the common law.<sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup> It reversed a century of equivocal jurisprudence which had muddied a formerly clear constitutional prohibition<sup><a href="#seventeen">17</a></sup> against taxation without legal authority.<sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup> A recent English case has embraced this rule,<sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a></sup> and its importance for constitutional and administrative law has been recognized.<sup><a href="#twenty">20</a></sup> Unfortunately,
Canadian courts have as yet been unwilling to adopt the principle advanced in <cite>Woolwich Equitable Building Society</cite>.<sup><a href="#twenty1">21</a></sup>   Nevertheless, the decision has met with general
favour from legal academics,<sup><a href="#twenty2">22</a></sup> and it will provide a strong impetus for the Supreme Court of Canada to reconsider the scope of restitution against public authorities for tax payments made
under an unconstitutional or <i>ultra vires</i> statute. The logic of <cite>Woolwich Equitable Building Society</cite> is compelling, and it is both desirable and necessary that the Supreme Court of Canada
revisit the issue in light of that decision. Indeed, <cite>Woolwich Equitable Building Society</cite> calls into question the correctness of its recently stated views.
<p>
Despite the Supreme Court of Canada's clouded exposition of the right to restitution for tax payments unlawfully collected, there is no question that unjust enrichment as a general principle has a solid grounding in Anglo-Canadian law. In recent years, the structure of the law of restitution has changed dramatically. The shift has been from a system which places limits upon the forms of action which will lead to a successful restitutionary claim towards a structure in which a broad general principle of unjust enrichment is limited by various defences.<sup><a href="#twenty3">23</a></sup> Courts have always harboured a concern about encouraging too much restitution. Formerly, they were content to allow the forms of action themselves to limit the scope of restitutionary claims. Now, it is the defences to the general principle which must limit restitutionary liability, and it is the defences which will become the focus of litigation over the coming years. This is why the need for courts to delineate the extent of
defences to the general principle of unjust enrichment has become so pressing. These defences include change of position,<sup><a href="#twenty4">24</a></sup> estoppel,<sup><a href  = "#twenty5">25</a></sup>
limitation,<sup><a href="#twenty6">26</a></sup> bona fide purchase,<sup><a href="#twenty7">27</a></sup> and illegality,<sup><a href="#twenty8">28</a></sup> among others.<sup><a href="#twenty9">29</a></sup> Not surprisingly, the `passing on' defence has received only limited attention, given that the right to recover taxes paid under an unlawful statute has only begun to emerge.<sup><a href="#thirty">30</a></sup>
<p>
Until only recently, English cases discussed the `passing on' defence only in <i>dicta</i>,<sup><a href="#thirty1">31</a></sup> although a version of the defence is recognized by statute in England.<sup><a href="#thirty2">32</a></sup> More recently, the `passing on' defence was considered and rejected in England in the context of the `swaps' litigation.<sup><a href="#thirty3">33</a></sup> In <cite>Kleinwort Benson</cite>,<sup><a href="#thirty4">34</a></sup> the plaintiff merchant bank had entered into
several interest-rate swaps agreements with the defendant Council. Trouble arose when the Divisional Court (and later the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords) determined that swaps contracts were <i>ultra vires</i> local councils.<sup><a href="#thirty5">35</a></sup> Four of the five swaps contracts were incomplete at the time of this determination. However, under the incomplete contracts, the plaintiffs had advanced funds to the defendants, and the plaintiffs had not received an equivalent amount in return from the defendants at the time that the contracts were declared void. The plaintiffs brought an action in restitution for recovery of the difference between what they had advanced to the Council and what they had received.
<p>
The Council attempted to advance a defence of `passing on.' Essentially, it argued that as the plaintiffs had hedged their liability under the relevant contracts, they had succeeded in recouping from third parties any losses they might have suffered from the failure of the swaps contracts with the Council, and thus any enrichment enjoyed by the Council had not come at the plaintiffs' expense. Hobhouse J. unequivocally rejected the Council's argument:
<blockquote>
What contracts or other transactions or engagements the plaintiffs may have entered into with third parties have nothing to do with the principle of restitution. Therefore it suffices in the present case for the plaintiffs to show that they were the payors of the relevant money, that the defendants were unjustly enriched by the payments and that there is no obstacle to restitution.<sup><a href="#thirty6">36</a></sup>
</blockquote>
It is submitted that this is the proper course for Canadian law to follow. Hobhouse J. noted, however, that in the context of taxation, different considerations might apply. In my view, the approach which Hobhouse J. applied to the question of recovery of moneys paid under a void contract is equally applicable to the recovery of moneys paid under an invalid tax.
<p>
The `passing on' defence was similarly rejected in Australia by Windeyer J. in <cite>Mason v. New South Wales</cite>.<sup><a href="#thirty7">37</a></sup> In that case, the High Court of Australia allowed the recovery of licence fees exacted from road carriers under an <i>ultra vires</i> statute. Windeyer J. dismissed
the State's attempt to mount a `passing on' defence by showing that the plaintiffs had `passed on' the expense of permits to their customers. To the contrary, his understanding was that the law of unjust enrichment does not require the plaintiff to demonstrate that he has suffered a deprivation which mirrors the defendant's enrichment. On this account, it is immaterial to the restitutionary action against the public authority whether the plaintiff may have
`passed on' to his customers the expense of a tax imposed on him.<sup><a href="#thirty8">38</a></sup> More recently, however, there have been signs that the `passing on' defence may have found favour in Australia.<sup><a href="#thirty9">39</a></sup> It will be seen, then, that the issue is in a state of flux.
<p>
The `passing on' defence figured prominently in two decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, <cite>Air Canada</cite><sup><a href="#forty">40</a></sup> and <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite>.<sup><a href="#forty1">41</a></sup> Its availability is intimately linked with the ability of taxpayers to recover tax payments made to public authorities under a mistake of fact or law. For reasons set out below, it is my view that the majority judgment in <cite>Air Canada</cite> erred in admitting the `passing on' defence in that case, whereas in  <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite>, the Court was correct in implicitly rejecting the defence on the one hand, but allowing it to be advanced on the other. The confusion which has resulted stems directly from the Supreme Court's inconsistent approach to the defence. The recent decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <cite>Allied Air Conditioning</cite><sup><a href="#forty2">42</a></sup> is indicative of the uncertainty which the combination of <cite>Air Canada</cite> and <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite> has engendered. In my view, the Court of Appeal in <cite>Allied Air Conditioning</cite> erroneously allowed the `passing on' defence to be raised in that case. The better approach was expressed by Oliver J. at trial in the British Columbia Supreme
Court,<sup><a href="forty3">43</a></sup> where the proper test was applied and the `passing on' defence
rejected.
<p>
This article begins, in Sections Two and Three, with a discussion of the major Canadian cases on the `passing on' defence (<cite>Air Canada</cite>, <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite>, and <cite>Allied Air Conditioning</cite>). It then outlines, in Sections Four and Five, a legal and economic model of the `passing on' defence in order to demonstrate that the current law is unsatisfactory. Sections Six and Seven consider the European and American experiences with the `passing on' defence, with a view to extracting principles to guide
the development of the law in Canada. In Sections Eight and Nine, these principles are applied to a model for the application of the `passing on' defence. Some brief conclusions are set out in Section Ten.
<p>
<h3>2.  The Canadian `Passing on' Rule: <cite>Air Canada</cite> and <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite></h3>

The leading Canadian case concerning the `passing on' defence is the complicated decision in <cite>Air Canada</cite>.<sup><a href="#forty4">44</a></sup> Three airlines brought an action for restitution of
gasoline taxation payments made between 1974 and 1976 to the government of British Columbia under a provincial statute<sup><a href="#forty5">45</a></sup> which was subsequently held to be unconstitutional because it mandated indirect taxation.<sup><a href="#forty6">46</a></sup> The <cite>Act</cite> was amended in 1976 in an effort to correct its perceived deficiencies. However, in 1981, legislation was passed purporting both to apply the 1976 changes retroactively to the 1974--1976 period, as well as to confiscate the taxes which had been paid during that period. Three issues were presented for the Supreme Court's consideration. First, was the original  <cite>Gasoline Tax Act</cite> constitutionally valid as imposing a direct tax within the province?  Second, if the <cite>Gasoline Tax Act</cite> was <i>ultra vires</i> the Province, could the 1981 legislation retroactively impose the tax as well as permit the retention of the payments which had been made under the old invalid legislation?
Finally, could the tax paid under an <i>ultra vires</i> statute be recovered by the taxpayers, apart from statute?
<p>
All of the judges agreed that the original (pre-1976) <cite>Gasoline Tax Act</cite> provisions were <i>ultra vires</i> the province. They also agreed that the 1976 legislation remedied the deficiencies of the original legislation. Finally, all agreed that the province possessed the authority to impose a tax with retroactive application.
The disagreement arose over the province's ability to use the 1981 legislation to confiscate the taxes which had been paid between 1974 and 1976 under the invalid pre-1976 legislation. Beetz and McIntyre JJ. held that the 1981 legislation was valid in its entirety, and denied recovery to the airlines on this basis, so they did not express an opinion on the third issue. They agreed, however, that if necessary, they would have adopted La Forest J.'s views on the rule as to the recovery of taxes paid under an <i>ultra vires</i> statute. La Forest J. (with whom Lamer and L'Heureux-Dub&eacute; JJ. concurred) wrote the leading judgment. For him, the real question in the case
was whether the 1981 legislation was <i>ultra vires</i> because its confiscatory provisions coloured its retroactive taxing provisions, with the result that the entire enterprise was invalid. His view was that the confiscatory provision, while clumsy, was merely the Province's chosen method of putting into effect the retroactive tax
provisions. The fact that the amount owing under the retroactive provisions was identical to the amount confiscated did not give him cause for concern.
<p>
Having answered the second question in the affirmative, five of the six judges (Wilson J. dissenting) decided the case on the basis that the 1981 legislation was valid and thus denied recovery to the airlines. However, La Forest J. went on to consider a framework to deal with the third issue, namely the rules to regulate the recovery of taxes paid under an unlawful statute. It should be noted that these views are technically <i>obiter dicta</i>, but are important
because the issues involved were considered at some length. La Forest J. held that as a general rule, money paid under mistake of law should be recoverable.<sup><a href="#forty7">47</a></sup> In so doing, he adopted the minority position of Dickson J. (as he then was) in <cite>Hydro-Electric Commission of the Township of Nepean v. Ontario Hydro</cite>, which had strongly criticized the distinction between mistake of law and mistake of fact as a basis for regulating recovery.<sup><a href="#forty8">48</a></sup> <cite>Air Canada</cite> has been discussed elsewhere primarily for its rejection of this distinction, and the accompanying rule barring recovery for payments made under a mistake of law.<sup><a href="#forty9">49</a></sup> But as we shall see, it is an open question whether in eliminating the mistake of fact/mistake of law distinction on the one
hand, La Forest J. resurrected it with the other. This question arises because La Forest J. also held that there were certain exceptions to this general principle which should apply here to deny recovery of the tax payments by the plaintiff airlines.<sup><a href="#fifty">50</a></sup> Two special policy considerations, namely the `passing on' defence, and the potential disruption to the public finances which might be caused by repayment,<sup><a href="#fifty1">51</a></sup> precluded recovery of the taxation payments, even though the statute in question was admittedly unconstitutional.<sup><a href="#fifty2">52</a></sup>
<p>
While La Forest J. had no doubt that British Columbia had been enriched by receipt of the taxes, he considered the question of whether the province had been enriched <i>at the expense of the plaintiff airlines</i> to be of central importance. He accepted British Columbia's argument that the airlines had been able to `pass on' the tax to their passengers, such that the province's enrichment came at the expense of the passengers, and not the airlines themselves. La Forest J. did not deny that an action in restitution might still lie against British Columbia, only that it could not be brought by these particular plaintiffs (namely, the airlines). It may be inferred that `passing on' does not provide the defendant public authority with a general defence: it asserts only that the enrichment came at the expense of a third party, namely the plaintiff's customers. 
<p>
For their part, the airlines argued that the `passing on' defence could apply only when the tax had been explicitly charged by the airlines to their passengers, ``so as to make those parties [the passengers] the true taxpayers.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty3">53</a></sup> The mere fact that the airlines had attempted to recover the cost of the tax from their passengers should not bar the airlines' recovery of the tax payments from the province.
The airlines advanced an economic argument, which is examined in some detail below:<sup><a href="#fifty4">54</a></sup> that as they were forced to raise the ticket prices charged to passengers in order to cover the cost of the gasoline tax, their sales revenues were likely adversely affected, which would in turn result in decreased profits. Although this is not, strictly speaking, a restitutionary argument---it is more properly a claim in tort---it does reveal that the allegation that the airlines could simply `pass on' the cost of taxes to their customers without suffering adverse effects themselves is misconceived.
<p>
In outlining the `passing on' defence, La Forest J. turned to the American experience for assistance. He cited with approval a passage from Professor George Palmer's <cite>The Law of Restitution</cite> to the effect that unless it could be demonstrated that the burden of a tax had not been shifted to others, then &quot;it seems preferable to leave the enrichment with the tax authority instead of putting the judicial machinery in motion for the purpose of shifting the same enrichment to the taxpayer.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty5">55</a></sup> In my view, this is an argument of convenience, not one of principle. Certainly, it may be difficult and complicated to determine who has
borne the expense of the government's unjust enrichment. Yet it should not follow from this that the government is entitled to retain the enrichment. An unjust enrichment must be disgorged if there is no valid juridical reason why it should be retained.<sup><a href="#fifty6">56</a></sup> Furthermore, it is unclear why the complexity of the economic consequences of asserting a `passing on' defence should fall in favour of the defendant public authority, who is, after all, the party advancing the defence. It seems more appropriate, if the defence is to be allowed at all, that the burden of asserting it should fall upon the defendant. La Forest J. held that if it were necessary, he would have allowed the defence of `passing on' to be advanced in <cite>Air Canada</cite>, as the airlines had, on the evidence, `passed on' the burden of the tax to their passengers. But as I discuss below,<sup><a href="#fifty7">57</a></sup> this is of course what all firms must do: `pass on' the cost of their inputs (as much as possible) to their consumers. La Forest J. concluded his analysis of the `passing on' defence by stating that &quot;[t]he law of restitution is not intended to provide windfalls to plaintiffs who have suffered no  loss.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty8">58</a></sup> Yet an examination of the economic difficulties associated with `passing on' of a tax by a firm to its customers demonstrates that this conclusion is wrong on two counts. First, it is very likely that the plaintiffs in <cite>Air Canada</cite> did suffer a loss. Second, the view misconceives what a `loss' is in restitution. There can be no question but that the airlines paid the tax to the government. 
<p>
Brief mention must also be made of the second basis upon which La Forest J. denied recovery to the airlines in <cite>Air Canada</cite>. He stated that even if the airlines had been able to demonstrate that they had borne the burden of the tax, he would still have denied recovery. Indeed, La Forest J. indicated that this second basis
would have been the ground upon which he would have dismissed the airlines' action. Since <cite>Woolwich Equitable Building Society</cite> seriously undermines this second ground (to say nothing of the main ground of decision in <cite>Air Canada</cite>), however, `passing on' may remain as the sole ground of decision in <cite>Air Canada</cite>. La Forest J. raised the familiar concern that it might be severely disruptive to public finances to require a public authority to repay moneys received under a tax statute which was subsequently found to be
illegaL.<sup><a href="#fifty9">59</a></sup> A brief survey of the experience of other jurisdictions lent support
to his argument that ``there are solid grounds of public policy for not according a general right of recovery in these circumstances, and ... this prohibition exists quite independently of the law of restitution.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty">60</a></sup>
<p>
While there has been some debate on this point,<sup><a href="#sixty1">61</a></sup> in my view, this argument is unconvincing as a general proposition.<sup><a href="#sixty2">62</a></sup> There may of course be some cases in which the amount of money at issue would be so large that to require restitution would cause a crisis in the public finances.<sup><a href="#sixty3">63</a></sup> But most cases are unlikely to be of this sort, so that a blanket prohibition upon recovery is inappropriate. The particular circumstances of each case, taking into account factors such as the amount of money at stake, the size and resources of the public authority, the nature of the tax regime, and the public authority's ability to raise funds, must all be considered. One must also ask why public authorities should be treated any differently from private individuals in this regard.<sup><a href="#sixty4">64</a></sup> There are many instances where <i>A</i> has been unjustly enriched at the expense of  <i>B</i> and a large sum of money is at stake. In such cases, it will often be onerous to require <i>A</i> to return the money to <i>B</i>. Yet in the absence of a valid defence, it must be returned. 
<p>
Of course, private defendants have the defence of `change of position' available to them, and public authorities may also be able to advance this defence.<sup><a href="#sixty5">65</a></sup> The burden of proof rests with the defendant, however, and it seems unlikely that a public authority---perhaps with the exception of a small public authority, such as a municipal council<sup><a href="#sixty6">66</a></sup> ---would be able to discharge this
burden.<sup><a href="#sixty7">67</a></sup>  Professor Beatson views this as a reason why there
should be some sort of rule granting special protection for public authorities against actions in restitution.<sup><a href="#sixty8">68</a></sup> The Law Commission has taken a similar view.<sup><a href =  "#sixty9">69</a></sup> On the other hand, it may be argued that if there is to be a different rule for public authorities than for private individuals, rule of law considerations suggest that the former should be held to a stricter standard of conduct, not a lesser one.<sup><a href="#seventy">70</a></sup> Clearly, there may be some limits placed upon the ability of taxpayers to recover in actions for unjust enrichment from public bodies.<sup><a href="#seventy1">71</a></sup> Defences must not become so broad that they undermine the integrity of the underlying cause of action, and thus amount to crude barriers which prevent recovery in standard cases. In my view, there is little to recommend a blanket `disruption of public finances' rule to limit recovery against public authorities.<sup><a href="#seventy2">72</a></sup> It may be that legislatures will think it essential that for particular taxes, there should be a statutory framework to regulate recovery. And indeed, the constitutional considerations outlined in <cite>Amax Potash</cite> suggest that provinces would be prudent to enact statutory regimes to regulate the recovery of taxes.<sup><a href="#seventy3">73</a></sup> But in the absence of such a
framework, the presumption must be one of recovery as of right.<sup><a href="#seventy4">74</a></sup> Any legislation which derogates from this common law standard must do so specifically. 
<p>
Thus, La Forest J. was of the view that where taxes are paid under legislation which is later determined to have been unconstitutional or <i>ultra vires</i>, there is a policy rule against recovery. Conversely, where the tax payment has been received due to the misapplication of an otherwise valid statute or regulation, the general principles of restitution should apply. This distinction is made largely with an eye to the potential magnitude of repayment which might arise under the respective situations. It is unlikely that a large amount of money could be collected through the consistent misapplication of an otherwise valid statute, so recovery would be allowed in such situations. By way of comparison, it seems possible that money could be collected under a tax statute for years before it was determined that the statute in question was unconstitutional or <i>ultra vires</i>. The problem with La Forest
J.'s approach is that it resuscitates the mistake of fact/mistake of law distinction which <cite>Air Canada</cite> itself purports to lay to rest.<sup><a href="#seventy5">75</a></sup> Where a statute is deemed to be valid but misapplied, there has likely been a mistake of fact involving a single taxpayer or a small group of taxpayers. Under La Forest J.'s rule, recovery is permitted in such circumstances. Where taxes are found to have been collected
under a statute which is subsequently determined to have been unconstitutional or <i>ultra vires</i>, however, there is likely to have been a mistake of law. Yet La Forest J.'s rule would preclude recovery in such circumstances. The rule's sole purpose is to exclude the possibility of fiscal disruption for public authorities, no matter how remote. As Maddaugh and McCamus note, &quot;The more severe the legislator's error, the less likely it is that the taxpayer will recover.&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy6">76</a></sup> This result is highly unsatisfactory. As we have seen, there are other methods by which legislatures can ensure that their finances are not disrupted. The rule against recovery in the case of <i>ultra vires</i> or unconstitutional statutes amounts to the rebirth of the mistake of law/mistake of fact distinction, with all of its unfairness and arbitrary results. It severely undercuts any general
right of recovery.
<p>
Wilson J.'s dissent in <cite>Air Canada</cite> provides the basis for a more principled way to regulate the recovery of payments made under an unlawful statute. She agreed that the <cite>Gasoline Tax Act</cite> was <i>ultra vires</i> the Province in 1974 and remained so until corrected by the 1976 amendments, after which the <cite>Act</cite> was <i>intra vires</i> the Province. But she departed from the majority by objecting to the constitutionality of the 1981 legislation, which in her view imposed a retroactive tax to cover the 1974--1976 period
in order to confiscate the payments which had been made under the original unconstitutional version of the <cite>Act</cite>. Wilson J. believed this to be a colourable attempt on the part of the Province &quot;to achieve indirectly what it could not achieve directly, namely the imposition of an <i>ultra vires</i>  tax,&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy7">77</a></sup> in direct contradiction to the <cite>Amax Potash</cite> principle.<sup><a href="#seventy8">78</a></sup> It was not the retroactive application of the tax which aroused her ire, but the combined effect of the retroactive tax with the confiscatory provision which indicated that the 1981 legislation was merely an
attempt to give legal effect to an unconstitutional statute.
<p>
Wilson J. was less concerned than La Forest J. with removing the rule against recovery for payments made under a mistake of law, because she did not believe that the plaintiffs' right to recovery was based upon this ground. In her view, the mistake of law doctrine should apply only to mistaken payments made under &quot;perfectly valid legislation,&quot; but not here, where payments were made under unconstitutional legislation &quot;quite properly presumed by the taxpayer to be constitutional.&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy9">79</a></sup> The unjust factor, on her account, was the very fact that the legislation was unlawful. Wilson J. would have allowed recovery for all payments made under a legally invalid tax provision. Not surprisingly, she refused to adopt La Forest J.'s broad exceptions to this general principle of recovery, which in her view undermined the integrity of the general principle. She held that governments should not be put in a privileged position as compared with private litigants: there should be no exception for public authorities to the general right to recovery. A `fiscal chaos' defence would place the burden of the government's errors upon individual taxpayers, which would be particularly inappropriate, because in most cases taxpayers make payments in the innocent belief that government demands have a legal foundation. The better approach would be to spread the cost of repaying the taxes across all taxpayers. She did not accept La Forest J.'s distinction between recovery for misapplied but otherwise valid legislation and recovery where the statute was <i>ultra vires</i> or unconstitutionaL.<sup><a href="#eighty">80</a></sup>
<p>
Wilson J. also rejected La Forest J.'s application of the `passing on' defence. She disputed the majority's claim that to allow recovery of the taxes would amount to a &quot;windfall&quot; for the airlines, even if the airlines had `passed on' the cost of the taxes to their customers. In response to La Forest J.'s assertion that the plaintiffs had been unable to show that the unjust enrichment was at their expense as opposed to that of their customers, she stated:
<blockquote>
In my view, there is no requirement that they be able to do so. Where the payments were made pursuant to an unconstitutional statute there is no legitimate basis on which they can be retained.<sup><a href="#eighty1">81</a></sup>
</blockquote>
To allow the provincial legislature to retain the tax payments would be, according to Wilson J., to sanction the use of unlawful taxation statutes. Commentators for the most part suggest that Wilson J. got the better of this exchange.<sup><a href="#eighty2">82</a></sup> 
<p>
On the same day that judgment was handed down in <cite>Air Canada</cite>, the Supreme Court of Canada decided a companion case, <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite>.<sup><a href="#eighty3">83</a></sup> In that case, the plaintiff airlines sought to recover social service tax<sup><a href="#eighty4">84</a></sup> wrongly paid on aircraft parts and equipment. One of the plaintiffs (&quot;Air Canada&quot;) also sought recovery of social service tax paid on alcoholic beverages sold to passengers in flight. The social service tax was imposed as a percentage of the purchase price on the sale of tangible personal property within the province. The legislation deemed the airlines to be agents of the Minister for the purposes of collecting the tax from the airlines' customers. The Court held that the social service tax did not apply to the airlines' aircraft and parts, and that they could recover the tax payments made under the statute on the aircraft parts and equipment. The Court also held that the social service tax could not apply to alcoholic beverages consumed in flight. Nevertheless, it denied recovery of these latter tax payments on the basis that the tax had been imposed upon the passengers who had consumed the beverages, and not upon the airline.<sup><a href="#eighty5">85</a></sup> Even Wilson J., who had strongly
dissented in <cite>Air Canada</cite>, accepted La Forest J.'s view on this point in <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite>. She distinguished this case from <cite>Air Canada</cite> on the basis that in the latter case, the
tax was imposed on the airlines, whereas here the tax on the sale of alcoholic beverages was imposed on the passengers themselves.<sup><a href="#eighty6">86</a></sup>
<p>
Some degree of uncertainty has now arisen as to what the law is regarding the `passing on' defence. <cite>Air Canada</cite> and <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite> appear to come to opposite conclusions. Recovery would have been precluded on the basis of `passing on' in <cite>Air Canada</cite>. Yet in <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite>, `passing on' seemed to apply to the social service tax on alcoholic beverages, but not to the aircraft parts and equipment. The distinction between the two cases (and the two taxes in <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite>) is not immediately apparent. As the next section indicates, the confusion resulting from the Supreme Court's misapplication of the `passing on' defence has been reflected by conflicting interpretations of the defence in the lower courts.
<p>
<h3>3.  Confusion Reigns: The Progeny of <cite>Air Canada</cite> and <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite></h3>

<cite>Air Canada</cite> has been interpreted by the lower courts to stand for the proposition that the recovery of taxes paid under a mistake of law should as a general rule be governed by the law of restitution.<sup><a href="#eighty7">87</a></sup> Attempts to reconcile <cite>Air Canada</cite> with <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite> have proven intractable, however. This difficulty is demonstrated by a recent decision, <cite>Allied Air Conditioning Inc. v. British Columbia</cite>,<sup><a href="#eighty8">88</a></sup> in which the British Columbia Court of Appeal reversed the earlier judgment of the British Columbia Supreme  Court.<sup><a href="#eighty9">89</a></sup> A group of air conditioning and heat pump contractors brought an action in unjust enrichment against the Province of British Columbia for recovery of social service tax payments which the plaintiffs alleged were wrongfully collected.<sup><a href="#ninety">90</a></sup> The same statute, it will be recalled, was the subject of litigation in <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite>. The contractors had replied to private tenders for construction projects with lump sum bids to install air conditioning and heat pump equipment. The prices submitted in these lump sum bids included all labour, equipment, and applicable taxes, including the provincial social service tax. The invoices sent by the plaintiffs to their customers did not set out the amount of tax paid by the plaintiffs on each contract. 
<p>
Both parties agreed that the plaintiffs had paid taxes due to a misapplication of the <cite>Social Service Tax Act</cite>.<sup><a href="#ninety1">91</a></sup> While the <cite>Act</cite> was not <i>ultra vires</i> the
province's legislative powers, it had been mistakenly applied to the transactions in question.<sup><a href="#ninety2">92</a></sup> As a `misapplied but otherwise valid statute' case, and not an `unconstitutional or <i>ultra vires</i> statute' case, the `fiscal chaos' policy rule from <cite>Air Canada</cite> could not apply to preclude recovery. The issue was whether the tax payments made under the <cite>Act</cite> were recoverable. British Columbia argued that although it may have been unjustly enriched by the payments, it was not unjustly enriched <i>at the expense of the contractors</i>. Oliver J. noted that in <cite>Air Canada</cite> the airlines' claim had been rejected because the airlines had not demonstrated that the province's unjust enrichment had been at their expense, as opposed to at the expense of their customers: &quot;The airline [sic] recovered the expense of the tax by passing it on to its customers and thus could not claim to have been deprived.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety3">93</a></sup>
<p>
British Columbia argued that the Supreme Court of Canada in <cite>Air Canada</cite> had set out two propositions. First, it had rejected the airlines' argument that the `passing on' defence should be available
only where the tax has been specifically charged to other identified parties so as to make those parties the true taxpayers. Second, it affirmed that the onus is on the taxpayer to demonstrate that it actually bore the burden of the tax. The fact that the taxpayer had nominally paid the tax is insufficient evidence alone to prove the second restitutionary requirement of a deprivation. Thus, British Columbia argued that the `passing on' defence is available to a public authority whenever the taxpayer does not displace the presumption that it has `passed on' the tax burden to its customers. Moreover, the `passing on' defence applies whether or not the tax was `passed on' directly and specifically to customers as a separate charge, or was included in the general price charged to the plaintiffs' customers.
<p>
Not surprisingly, the contractors rejected this interpretation of <cite>Air Canada</cite>. They argued that <cite>Air Canada</cite> must be viewed in conjunction with <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite> in order to properly understand the Supreme Court of Canada's view of the `passing on' defence. The contractors suggested that in <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite>, the Supreme Court had implicitly accepted that the distinction between different forms of taxation was relevant for the `passing on' defence. Taxes directly and specifically `passed on' to customers (such as the tax on alcoholic beverages) should not be recoverable by the firm, whereas taxes not directly and specifically `passed on' (such as the tax on aircraft parts and equipment) should be recoverable. By allowing recovery of the taxes paid for the aircraft parts and equipment, the Supreme Court must have rejected the application of the `passing on' defence to that part of the airline's claim. The taxes were not `passed on' to the
airline's customers directly and specifically, but instead were included along with other costs in the general price charged to consumers. The contractors in <cite>Allied Air Conditioning</cite> argued that the tax imposed upon their contracts was analogous to the tax upon aircraft parts and equipment in <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite>
(indeed, both cases concerned the social service tax), and thus that it was recoverable.
<p>
Oliver J. accepted the contractors' interpretation of the `passing on' case law, stating that: 
<blockquote>
the requirements of unjust enrichment are satisfied where the taxpayer can show that it has not `specifically and directly' passed on the burden of tax to its customers. Only where such tax expense has been directly passed on to the customers, making them the `true taxpayers,' can the passing-on defence apply.<sup><a href="#ninety4">94</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Applying this to the case at bar, Oliver J. ordered recovery of the tax payments from the province. The contractors had invoiced their customers for lump sum payments, so the contracts did not set out a separate sum indicating the amount of tax payable. In these circumstances, the Court held that the tax is not `passed on' to the taxpayers. 
<p>
Oliver J. also distinguished <cite>Air Canada</cite> from <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite> on the basis that in <cite>Air Canada</cite>, the taxes were not payable because they were levied under an <i>ultra vires</i> or unconstitutional statute, whereas in <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite>, the tax statute was valid, but had been erroneously applied to the airlines. Following La Forest J.'s rule in <cite>Air Canada</cite> (unconstitutional or <i>ultra vires</i> taxes are not recoverable in an action in unjust enrichment due to policy reasons &quot;quite independent of the law of restitution&quot;), Oliver J. allowed recovery here, because the statute had been misapplied to the heat pumps and air conditioning equipment. According to this theory, the `passing on' defence has potential application only in cases where the taxing statute is valid but mistakenly applied. The defence is
redundant where the tax statute is unconstitutional or <i>ultra vires</i>, as there can be no recovery due to `policy reasons' in such cases. If, as I have argued, La Forest J.'s distinction between unconstitutional/<i>ultra vires</i> tax statutes and misapplied tax statutes cannot be sustained, then the application of the `passing on' defence must be rethought. Indeed, one also wonders how comfortable the Supreme Court of Canada is with the <cite>Air Canada</cite> rule: it is intriguing that La Forest J. felt obliged to discuss the `passing on' defence in such detail in <cite>Air Canada</cite>, given that his decision ultimately did not rest upon it. Even if La Forest J. was correct on the unconstitutional/<i>ultra vires</i> point---and with respect, I do not accept that he was---he was surely in error on the `passing on' point.
<p>
The Court of Appeal reversed. Legg J.A. rejected Oliver J.'s interpretation of <cite>Air Canada</cite> and <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite> which permitted the taxpayer to recover where it could demonstrate that the burden of the tax had been included generally in the price charged to customers, as opposed to being specifically and directly `passed on' through representation of the tax to customers as a separate charge. Legg J.A. interpreted La Forest J.'s decision in <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite> to hold that since the social service tax did not apply to the airlines' aircraft parts and equipment, and since the province could not resist recovery of the tax payments on the basis that the plaintiffs had made a mistake of law, the plaintiffs were entitled to recover the taxes erroneously paid on the aircraft parts and equipment. But Legg J.A. noted that &quot;[t]he decision does not explain how this result was reached.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety5">95</a></sup> He held that <cite>Air Canada</cite> and <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite> could be reconciled through a single interpretation: that in the latter case (at least with regard to the tax on aircraft parts and equipment), La Forest J. had found not only that the province was unjustly enriched, but that the airline had borne the burden of the enrichment. &quot;Given La Forest J.'s description in <cite>Air Canada</cite> of the exception to the general rule against recovery, these conclusions follow by necessary implication.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety6">96</a></sup>
<p>
Legg J.A. rejected Oliver J.'s view that the `passing on' defence is unavailable where the burden of the tax has not been directly and specifically `passed on' to the plaintiffs' customers, but instead has been included generally in the calculation of the price of goods or services sold to the customers. To the contrary, he held that &quot;[i]f a tax expense has been included generally in the calculation of the price to a customer, the tax has been `passed on' and the taxpayer has not shown that he has borne the burden of the tax.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety7">97</a></sup> Furthermore, Legg J.A. interpreted La Forest J.'s judgment in <cite>Air Canada</cite> to place the onus on the plaintiffs to demonstrate that they, and not their customers, had borne the burden of the tax. On this test, the plaintiffs in <cite>Allied Air Conditioning</cite> had not discharged their onus. He thus held that the Province's appeal should be allowed, and that the trial court's order requiring restitution of the tax payments to the plaintiffs should be reversed.
<p>
Taylor J.A., with whom Proudfoot J.A. concurred, wrote a brief judgment concurring with that of Legg J.A. In his view, the main issue was whether the contractors had demonstrated that they had suffered a deprivation at the hands of the defendant province, or whether the deprivation had been `passed on' to the contractors' customers. He explained the result in <cite>Air Canada</cite> as having turned on the Supreme Court of Canada's determination that the airlines had `passed on' the fuel tax burden &quot;in the sense that the airline recovered it, as an operating cost, from its passengers.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety8">98</a></sup> Taylor J.A. distinguished <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite> on the basis that in that case, British Columbia had never advanced the `passing on' defence with regard to the tax payments on aircraft parts and equipment. Also, with respect to the tax on alcoholic beverages in <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite>, the airline never actually paid the tax in question, but instead acted only as a collection agent for the province as required by statute. Taylor J.A. rejected the trial
judge's view that the tax in <cite>Allied Air Conditioning</cite> was more analogous to the tax on aircraft parts and equipment than to the tax on alcoholic beverages in <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite>.
<p>
While he reached the same result as Legg J.A., Taylor J.A. reconciled <cite>Air Canada</cite> and <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite> on a different basis. He argued that the Supreme Court of Canada had allowed recovery for the taxes paid on aircraft parts and equipment in <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite>---and by implication rejected the application of the province's `passing on' defence---on the basis that aircraft parts and equipment were capital assets &quot;for the continuous use by the airline for the purpose of generating income.&quot; As such, taxes on these assets &quot;could not be said to be then `passed on' to passengers as part of their ticket  price.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety9">99</a></sup> This situation could be contrasted, not with the tax
on alcoholic beverages, which Taylor J.A. did not view as `passing on,' but instead with the fuel tax in <cite>Air Canada</cite>, the recovery of which the Supreme Court of Canada had denied to the airlines because it had been allegedly `passed on' to the airlines' passengers. The distinction was based on the fact that fuel is not a capital asset; instead, fuel costs are &quot;direct, or actual daily operating expenses&quot; recovered by passing them on to
customers.<sup><a href="#onehundred">100</a></sup> Taylor J.A. was of the view that <cite>Allied Air Conditioning</cite> provided an even better example of the operation of the <cite>Air Canada</cite> rule than <cite>Air Canada</cite> itself. Here, the fact that the tax on air conditioning and heat pump equipment had been included in the calculation of bid prices demonstrated that the burden of the tax had been `passed on' to the plaintiff's consumers.
<p>
<cite>Allied Air Conditioning</cite> reveals the confused state of the Canadian version of the `passing on' doctrine. Legg J.A.'s approach is based on the same faulty economic premise (namely, that a tax may simply be shifted by a firm to its customers) which La Forest J. adopted in <cite>Air Canada</cite>. Moreover, <cite>Allied Air Conditioning</cite> demonstrates how a `passing on' defence which places an onus upon the plaintiff to show that it has not `passed on' the economic burden of a tax to its customers will frustrate efforts to recover unlawfully collected taxes. Taylor J.A.'s attempts to explain <cite>Air Canada</cite> and <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite> by distinguishing between taxes on capital assets and taxes on operating expenses is similarly unhelpful. The economic cost of taxes on capital assets is almost invariably shifted to consumers by inclusion
in the general price of a firm's goods or services, as opposed to representing a separate and distinct charge to customers. But the same may be said for many operating expenses as well, such as the taxes on aviation fuel in <cite>Air Canada</cite>. Oliver J.'s approach at trial to this question is the better one. 
<p>
The substantial disagreement over the proper interpretation of the `passing on' defence has been reflected in other recent Canadian decisions. In <cite>Sobeys</cite>,<sup><a href="#one01">101</a></sup> a supermarket chain sought recovery of provincial sales tax which it had paid on butchering and fish processing equipment. It argued that the equipment was exempt from tax under the relevant provincial legislation, and was successful at trial. On appeal, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal held that on the wording of the statute, the equipment was not exempt, and the Attorney General's appeal was allowed. Nonetheless, comments made by Jones J.A. in <i>obiter</i> suggest that had there been an exemption for the equipment, he would have allowed recovery of the taxes.<sup><a href="#one02">102</a></sup> More recently, in <cite>Liquor Control Board of Ontario</cite>,<sup><a href="#one03">103</a></sup> the Court held that the LCBO had been collecting liquor taxes from airlines to which it was not entitled and ordered repayment. The airlines sold liquor to their passengers at a loss because they believed that competitive pressures demanded it. There was no relationship between the price charged to passengers and the cost of the liquor to the airlines. The LCBO argued that the airlines had `passed on' the cost of the LCBO mark-ups and fees to their customers. Saunders J. held that the evidence was to the contrary:
<blockquote>
Ticket prices and charges for liquor are a function of competitive conditions and are entirely independent of the cost of liquor. The economic burden of the mark-up and fees was not shifted to the passengers.<sup><a href="#one04">104</a></sup>
</blockquote>
In spite of such cases as <cite>Sobeys</cite> and <cite>Liquor Control Board of Ontario</cite>, the interpretation of the `passing on' defence set out by the Court of Appeal in <cite>Allied Air Conditioning</cite> seems to be predominant.<sup><a href="#one05">105</a></sup> In the following sections, I set out arguments demonstrating that the approach adopted by the Court of Appeal in <cite>Allied Air Conditioning</cite> is mistaken, and that this error stems directly from the manner in which the Supreme Court of Canada formulated the `passing on' defence in <cite>Air Canada</cite> and <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite>. The essential error of the `passing on' defence is that it misconstrues the function of the law of restitution.
<p>
<h3>4.  `Passing on' and the Structure of Unjust Enrichment</h3>

An evaluation of the `passing on' defence must be based on an understanding of the basic principles of unjust enrichment. The general test for unjust enrichment in Canada was outlined by Dickson J. (as he then was) in <cite>Pettkus</cite>.<sup><a href="#one06">106</a></sup> Three elements must be present in order to ground an action in unjust enrichment: an enrichment; a corresponding deprivation; and the ``absence of any juristic reason for the enrichment.&quot;  A valid defence to an action in unjust enrichment (other than a procedural defence, such as the invocation of a limitation period) must nullify one of these elements, such that defences may be usefully divided into three categories corresponding to the elements of the <cite>Pettkus</cite> test. One type of defence
refutes the assertion that the defendant gained an enrichment. A second type of defence stipulates that while the defendant may have gained an enrichment, it did not come at the expense of the plaintiff, so there is no &quot;corresponding deprivation.&quot;  The third type of defence goes to the &quot;unjust&quot; element of the equation, and suggests that there is a &quot;juristic reason&quot; for the enrichment, or alternatively, the lack of a juristic reason why the enrichment should now be disgorged.
<p>
The `passing on' defence arises in cases in which a public authority has been unjustly enriched at the expense of a taxpayer.<sup><a href="#one07">107</a></sup> `Passing on' cannot arise in disputes between private parties.<sup><a href="#one08">108</a></sup> In <cite>Allied Air Conditioning</cite>, for example, the tax payments were made under the erroneous understanding that the <cite>Social Service Tax Act</cite> applied to the
transactions. The first requirement of the <cite>Pettkus</cite> test---that the defendant public authority must have been enriched---is generally made out with little difficulty. A tax payment is usually made in the form of money, which by definition cannot be &quot;subjectively devalued&quot;<sup><a href="#one09">109</a></sup> by the defendant public authority. The defendant cannot claim that it has not been enriched by the receipt of money, because receipt of money <i>always</i> constitutes an enrichment. Instead, the `passing on' defence goes to
the second and third requirements of the <cite>Pettkus</cite> test. 
<p>
The main foundation for the `passing on' defence appears to be the concern that a plaintiff not be awarded a &quot;windfall.&quot;  This proposition can be divided into two related arguments. The first, which would appear to be related to the third element of the <cite>Pettkus</cite> test, is the concern that the plaintiff not be overcompensated by receiving repayment of taxes where it has suffered no loss. In <cite>Air Canada</cite>, for example, it is clear that La Forest J. believes that the airlines have suffered no loss. Yet as Professor Woodward notes, this analysis cannot provide an adequate explanation of the defence, because if it did, plaintiffs would be
compensated up to their demonstrated loss.<sup><a href="#one10">110</a></sup> Moreover, a concern about the so-called overcompensation of plaintiffs has not exerted much influence on the law of restitution. Several cases indicate that a plaintiff may recover from a defendant who has been unjustly enriched even where the plaintiff has suffered no demonstrable loss.<sup><a href="#one11">111</a></sup>
<p>
The second, stronger base for the defence is the argument that the plaintiff's customers were the real payers of the tax. As such, the real plaintiffs in the cases for the recovery of tax should be the customers, and not the firm, which is, in practice, only an intermediary. The issue, on this account, is not whether the government was unjustly enriched, but at whose expense the enrichment took place: the second branch of the <cite>Pettkus</cite> test. It would be inappropriate to take money belonging to customers from the government and award it to the plaintiff firm. This argument suggests that the `passing on' defence only postpones the government's day of reckoning. If the defence is upheld, the implication is that while the government has been enriched, it was not unjustly enriched <i>at the expense of this plaintiff</i>, because it has been demonstrated that <i>this plaintiff</i> did not pay the taxes in question. Thus, it would seem that the persons who <i>were</i> the bearers of the tax burden would be able to launch their own action in restitution against the public authority for repayment of the taxes. 
<p>
Put this way, the `passing on' defence seems uncontroversial. If the plaintiff did not actually make the taxation payments in question, why should a court require that the public authority disgorge the tax payments to this plaintiff?  While the defendant public authority has unquestionably been unjustly enriched, it may be even more unjust to order that the moneys be given to a plaintiff who seems not to have suffered a loss. But this simplicity is deceptive. The difficulty arises in the need to accurately define the scope of the `passing on' defence. This difficulty is compounded by the knowledge that when the plaintiff is a firm, its natural response is to view a tax
imposed on it as a cost of carrying on business. Much like any other tax payment made by a firm---for example, unemployment insurance premiums, payroll tax, municipal charges, and so on---the cost of a tax is spread out over the firm's customers through incorporation into the price of the firm's products or services. At first blush, it
would appear that a firm <i>never</i> bears the full burden of a tax, because the cost of any tax is `passed on' to the consumers of its products or services.<sup><a href="#one12">112</a></sup> In England, the Law Commission has noted that in theory, the `passing on' defence could be raised in <i>any</i> action for restitution where the plaintiff has attempted to make up its loss by raising the prices which it charges to its customers.<sup><a href="#one13">113</a></sup> Yet to adopt so broad an approach is to misunderstand the principle of unjust enrichment.
<p>
Where a firm has made a tax payment to a public authority under an unlawful statute, and it sues for restitution of the payment, the court is caught between two compelling claims. On the one hand, it seems unjust that the government should retain a taxation payment to which it has no legal right. (That is, the retention is `unjust'
according to the law of restitution, although it is also unsound constitutional policy). To allow the `passing on' defence to be advanced would be to allow the government to retain the ill-gotten gains of taxation payments made to it under an unlawful statute. At the same time, courts are apprehensive about awarding &quot;windfalls&quot;
to plaintiffs who seem to have `passed on' the economic burden of the disputed tax to their customers. As between the government and a firm which may appear not to have borne the economic burden of a tax, courts may exhibit a reluctance to require the public authority to disgorge the tax payments. A court may take a dim view of a plaintiff who wants to recover tax payments for its own private benefit, as opposed to a public authority which may intend to spend the tax payments on the provision of public services. (Although it is by no means clear that the more responsible course is to leave the funds with the government). Faced with this dilemma, what should the
courts do?
<p>
The courts should narrowly circumscribe the application of the `passing on' defence. For three reasons, a public authority which has been enriched should be required to disgorge the tax payment. The primary reason is that on a proper theory of unjust enrichment, only a narrow interpretation of the `passing on' defence is supportable. This article is informed by a conception of the law of restitution as fundamentally concerned with the prevention of unjust enrichment.<sup><a href="#one14">114</a></sup> Unlike in tort, a plaintiff in an action in restitution need not demonstrate that she has suffered a loss, only that the defendant has been unjustly enriched at her
expense. Of course, in many cases of unjust enrichment, the plaintiff will have suffered a tangible loss corresponding directly to the defendant's enrichment. If <i>A</i> mistakenly deposits $100 into <i>B</i>'s bank account, <i>B</i>'s enrichment is equal to <i>A</i>'s deprivation. But in other cases, the relationship between the
plaintiff's loss and the defendant's enrichment may not be so clear. Imagine a breach of fiduciary duty case, in which a trustee has taken money from the beneficiary's trust fund, invested it, made a large profit, and returned the original sum to the trust fund, while retaining the profits for himself. The beneficiary may have suffered no demonstrable loss. Yet an action in restitution still lies in such a case, and the trustee must account for his profits to the beneficiary. A similar result may be seen in the leading cases on the taking of corporate opportunities.<sup><a href="#one15">115</a></sup> Indeed, some of the most famous cases in the law of restitution---such as <cite>Reading v. Attorney-General</cite><sup><a href="#one16">116</a></sup> and the `Great Onyx Cave' case<sup><a href="#one17">117</a></sup> ---demonstrate that the measure of recovery in restitution is the defendant's benefit, and not the plaintiff's deprivation. A common law claim for restitution seeks not only to compensate for a loss, but also to deprive a party of a benefit which he unjustly retains.
<p>
More specific to the issue of `passing on,' the plaintiff in these cases has paid the taxes to the public authority, in the technical sense that it has transferred them to the public authority. As between the plaintiff firm and the public authority, the plaintiff's claim must be stronger, because the public authority has no basis for retaining the moneys so paid to it. Our desire to do justice to the plaintiff's customers, which accounts for the intuitive appeal of the `passing on' defence, should not cloud the determination of rights as between the plaintiff and the defendant public authority. In particular, it must not lead to the conclusion that the plaintiff should not recover at all. The plaintiff has paid the taxes to the public authority and is thus entitled to sue to recover them. That the plaintiff may have entered into contracts or have restitutionary obligations to its customers with regard to the taxes cannot affect
the &quot;at the expense of&quot; part of the restitutionary equation against the public authority. Thus, the `passing on' defence is inconsistent with the proper account of both the second and third elements of the
<cite>Pettkus</cite> test, and should be rejected as a defence.
<p>
Second, there are compelling constitutional reasons against allowing the government to retain unlawfully-collected tax payments, reasons suggested by Wilson J. in her dissent in <cite>Air Canada</cite>, averted to by Lord Goff in <cite>Woolwich Equitable Building Society</cite>,<sup><a href="#one18">118</a></sup> and set out more extensively by Professor Birks in his several commentaries on the subject.<sup><a href="#one19">119</a></sup> It is important to understand that the principle at issue consists not only of the invocation of the rule of law, although it does contain that element. The struggle for supremacy between King and Parliament had its historical focus upon the ability of the monarch to levy taxes without the consent of Parliament. Parliament won this battle, and its supremacy was confirmed by the Bill of Rights, which provided that the Crown could not levy taxes without Parliamentary consent.<sup><a href="#one20">120</a></sup> To modern citizens, such a principle may seem arcane. But there can be little doubt that it is an essential foundation of Anglo-Canadian constitutional government.<sup><a href="#one21">121</a></sup> As Professor Hogg explains, the principle enshrined in the Bill of Rights &quot;ensures not merely that the executive branch is subject to the rule of law, but also that the executive branch must call the legislative branch into session to raise taxes (and vote supply).&quot;<sup><a href="#one22">122</a></sup> Indeed, this principle takes on increased importance in the modern regulatory state, because it ensures that acts of the executive and administration which purport to impose taxes or other charges on citizens must have a legal foundation based on an act of the legislature. A broader version of the constitutional principle is that public authorities must not be permitted to benefit from unlawful conduct. In essence, to permit the government to retain taxes unlawfully collected is to sanction unlawful government conduct. There is no more powerful disincentive to unlawful government conduct than to prevent public authorities from gaining from such conduct. In the tax context, this necessarily implies that taxes collected under a statute which is invalid or misapplied---that is, taxes collected without a legal foundation---must be returned to the taxpayers.
<p>
The third reason to question the `passing on' defence is that the plaintiff firm is likely to have suffered &quot;collateral damage&quot; from the government's unlawful imposition of taxes upon it. The imposition of taxes will have adversely affected the plaintiff's business by causing it to raise its prices, reducing the volume demanded for its products or services, and thus reducing its revenue and profits.<sup><a href="#one23">123</a></sup> The plaintiff may also have suffered costs associated with the imposition of a tax, such as hiring lawyers and accountants, and the cost of time spent completing documentation, reconfiguring equipment, and so on. Of course, these losses stem from the wrongful imposition of the tax, a loss which should be distinguished from the deprivation caused by payment of the tax itself. An action for recovery of the former loss would be in tort,
not unjust enrichment. The particular cause of action in tort is as yet unrecognized: it would be a form of economic loss which we might call `wrongful taxation.'  The fact that the plaintiff has suffered this first type of loss should weigh heavily in the court's balancing of the equities when it comes to deciding whether to order restitution of the tax payments, however. Restitution of the tax payments made by the plaintiff to the public authority may partially
or fully compensate the plaintiff for these losses. 
<p>
The `passing on' defence appears to be closely tied to the argument that plaintiffs are under a duty to mitigate their losses. While a duty upon the plaintiff to mitigate its loss has never been recognized in the law of restitution, Professor Burrows has argued that the courts should impose such a duty.<sup><a href="#one24">124</a></sup> It is entirely unclear how this would work in practice. A duty to mitigate would require the plaintiff to undertake reasonable steps to reduce the extent of its loss.<sup><a href="#one25">125</a></sup> Yet in the context of restitution for taxes unlawfully collected, mitigation would require a plaintiff to `pass on' the burden of its deprivation to its customers. While there is a natural incentive for a plaintiff to `pass on' the tax burden, it is unclear why it should be <i>required</i> to do so. Burrows suggests that a mitigation defence is &quot;preferable&quot; because it would let the so-called `windfall' lie with the defendant, a state of affairs which &quot;minimizes legal intervention and litigation.&quot;<sup><a href="#one26">126</a></sup> As a matter of legal principle there is little to recommend this approach. A duty to mitigate would ensure that public authorities would never be required
to disgorge tax payments received under an unlawful statute, because plaintiff firms would be required to `pass on' the cost of the unlawful tax payments to their customers. As I outline in Section Five, it is often much more difficult for a business to `pass on' tax burdens to their customers than the courts have been prepared to admit. But more importantly, a duty to mitigate would allow public authorities to refrain from disgorging unlawfully collected tax payments.
<p>
In an action in unjust enrichment against a public authority for recovery of a tax payment made under an unlawful statute, a plaintiff should be under no duty to mitigate his or her deprivation because it is misleading to think of this deprivation as a `loss' in the tort or contract sense of the term. Compare the position of a firm which has suffered a tort at the hands of another party. Certainly, the firm is under an obligation to minimize the loss which results from the wrongful act, and must take all reasonable steps to do so. But a loss may remain despite the plaintiff's efforts. In the case of a firm, it may then attempt to make up the loss by `passing on' the cost of the loss to its customers in the form of higher prices. The customers may or may not choose to pay the higher prices. If enough customers do choose to pay the higher prices, so that the firm is able to `pass on' the cost of its loss to them, no one could argue that the defendant would not remain liable for the full cost of the loss caused by his wrongful act. Similarly, in restitution, the fact that the plaintiff may have `passed on' to others the amount by which he or she has been deprived by the defendant is not relevant in considering whether the defendant has been unjustly enriched at the
expense of the plaintiff. Mitigation has no place in the law of restitution.
<p>
<h3>5.  An Economic Model of `Passing On'</h3>

Economic analysis provides a critical objection to the `passing on' defence, suggesting that the economic logic underlying the `passing on' defence is unwieldy.<sup><a href="#one27">127</a></sup> The legal structure of
restitution must be informed by an awareness of the likely economic effects of particular legal rules. The economic analysis outlined in this section buttresses the legal arguments developed above against the `passing on' defence. The difficulty lies primarily in determining the extent to which the burden of a tax payment has actually been `passed on.'  To this end, an essential distinction must be drawn. Clearly, a public authority may make a person
statutorily liable for paying a tax. It does not necessarily follow from this, though, that the person on whom a tax is imposed bears the economic burden of the tax, because the burden may be shifted to other persons. Notwithstanding this, the person on whom the tax was initially imposed almost invariably suffers some residual impact of the tax, because a tax may be `passed on' to others only at some cost to the person on whom it was originally imposed.<sup><a href="#one28">128</a></sup> The person (or persons) on whom the economic
burden finally falls is said to bear the incidence of the tax.<sup><a href="#one29">129</a></sup> It is this distinction, and the analysis which follows, that render the existing approach to the `passing on' defence in the law of restitution, as set out in <cite>Air Canada</cite> and <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite>, of dubious authority.
<p>
The Supreme Court of Canada in <cite>Air Canada</cite> assumed that the plaintiff airlines could simply add the cost of the tax which had been imposed on them to the price charged to their customers, and thus suffer no loss because the tax had been `passed on.'  When a firm has a tax imposed on it by a public authority, it will attempt
to `pass on' the cost of that tax to its customers by raising the price which it charges to them for its products or services to take into account the cost of the tax. This process is not as simple as the Supreme Court has suggested. A firm's ability to `pass on' the economic burden of a tax is dependent on the relative elasticities of supply and demand for the firm's product or service. Elasticity is a measure of responsiveness of quantities supplied and demanded to changes in price.<sup><a href="#one30">130</a></sup> It is a commonplace observation that a rise in the price of a good or service will likely reduce consumer demand for it, and above a certain level, will adversely affect the firm's profits. Thus, a firm is likely to be harmed by the imposition of the tax even if it is able to `pass on'
the nominal amount of the tax to its customers by raising its prices. Only in certain rare situations will an increased price charged to consumers not affect their demand for the product or service. This result occurs when volume of demand for a product or service is perfectly inelastic, and customers will purchase the same amount of product or service regardless of the price charged. But a good or service for which demand is perfectly inelastic is really only an economist's abstraction; few economists can point to such a product or service in the real world.
<p>
Conversely, where demand for the firm's products or services is perfectly elastic---where the quantity demanded is immediately and radically connected to the price---the firm will be unable to `pass on' <i>any</i> of the tax burden to its customers. For if it raises its prices at all, its sales will drop to zero. Of course, few goods or services have demand curves which are perfectly elastic (or inelastic). The vast majority of goods and services have demand
elasticities which are either relatively elastic (price sensitive) or inelastic (more immune to price changes). Not to be forgotten are elasticities of supply: relatively elastic supply will force more of the economic burden of a tax onto the buyer, whereas relatively inelastic supply will force more of the tax burden onto the seller. Overall, then, as demand becomes more inelastic, or as supply becomes more elastic, the buyer will bear more of the burden of a tax. As demand becomes more elastic, or as supply becomes more inelastic, the seller will bear a greater proportion of the burden. The burden of a tax will be shared between a buyer and seller according to the ratio of elasticity of supply to elasticity of demand.<sup><a href="#one31">131</a></sup> The simple conclusion is that for almost all products and services, an increase in price will adversely affect the quantity demanded. The difficulty lies in determining exactly how the imposition of a tax on a firm affects its sales and profits. Few courts have recognized
this difficulty: most are content to state that if the taxpayer has been adversely affected by the imposition of a tax, it should be able to demonstrate this to the satisfaction of the court.<sup><a href="#one32">132</a></sup> The reality is considerably more complicated, as some courts have recognized.<sup><a href="#one33">133</a></sup> Professor Birks states that La Forest J.'s adoption of the `passing on' defence in <cite>Air Canada</cite> commits the court to &quot;an impossible inquiry.&quot;<sup><a href="#one34">134</a></sup>
<p>
The economic model also suggests that the incidence of a tax may be `passed up' as well as `passed on.'<sup><a href="#one35">135</a></sup> In addition to attempting to shift the economic burden of a tax onto its customers, a firm may also attempt to shift some or all of the burden of a tax `up' to its suppliers in the form of reducing the amount of money it is willing to pay them for inputs.<sup><a href="#one36">136</a></sup> Yet this process also has its limits. Few firms will be able to `pass up' the entire burden of a tax to their suppliers. In most situations, a firm will attempt to `pass on' some of the cost of a tax to its customers, and some of the cost to its suppliers. In most
cases, then, the burden of a tax is likely to be shared between the business, its customers, and the firm's suppliers. But exactly how much is `passed on' to each may be difficult to determine, and in many cases competitive pressures will ensure that only a portion of the total burden is `passed on.'  Moreover, the economic model suggests that a firm's profits may be adversely affected by the imposition of a tax on it, even if it is able to transfer the entire burden of the tax to its customers in the form of higher prices. Itbis facile, therefore, to suggest that a firm which has `passed on' thebburden of a tax to its customers has suffered no loss. 
<p>
An American case, <cite>Twentieth Century Sporting Club v. United States</cite>,<sup><a href="#one37">137</a></sup> highlights these concerns. The plaintiff (a boxing and wrestling promoter) collected a federal admission tax from attendees at its matches and transmitted the tax revenues to the government. The plaintiff sought recovery of overpayments made of the federal tax, claiming that instead of being applied to the base price of the ticket (without state taxes), the federal tax had been applied erroneously to the ticket price on top of state taxes, so that tax had been paid on tax. The statute regulating recovery permitted an action to be brought by
a &quot;taxpayer.&quot;  The Court of Claims held, however, that the plaintiff had merely collected the tax from its customers on behalf of the government. No action for recovery could lie because the promoter had never actually paid the tax in question.
<p>
Nevertheless, the promoter sought to show that it had in fact borne the burden of the taxation. While it may not have paid the impugned tax itself, it was economically harmed by the imposition of the tax. It is unfortunate that the plaintiff confused matters by not distinguishing between the &quot;burden&quot; of having to pay the tax and the &quot;burden&quot; of being economically harmed by the tax through decreased demand and lower profits. (Recall that an action to recover the first loss would be in restitution, whereas the second would require an action in tort which is as yet unrecognized, so-called `wrongful taxation'). The promoter argued that the maximum price it could charge its customers was $11.50 per ticket, including all taxes, because demand for tickets would fall rapidly if the price of tickets was set above $11.50. As a result, the burden of the federal government's erroneous computation of taxes was not `passed on' to customers (which would have driven the price up to $11.54) but was absorbed by the promoter. In order to ensure that the final consumer price did not go above $11.50, the promoter absorbed the excess federal tax; it paid the tax out of its profits by reducing its initial ticket price so that the final price remained the same.<sup><a href="#one38">138</a></sup> An example closer to home demonstrates that this is not an unusual situation. Before the imposition of the GST in Canada, <cite>The Toronto Star</cite> charged $0.50 for a weekday edition of the newspaper. After the imposition of the GST, the base price was reduced to $0.47 so that with GST, the final price to the consumer would remain at $0.50. Both the promoter in <cite>Twentieth Century Sporting Club</cite> and the proprietors of  <cite>The Toronto Star</cite> recognized that consumers do not want to be bothered with irregular prices, and that competition requires that prices remain low. Yet the Court of Claims in <cite>Twentieth Century Sporting Club</cite> held that the promoter had <i>chosen</i> to bear the burden of the federal government's tax error; it had not been compelled to do so. It thus dismissed the application.
<p>
The economic analysis in this section suggests that `passing on' is not the simple process that the Supreme Court of Canada has implied. A variety of economic factors conspire to ensure that when a tax is imposed on a firm, the economic burden of the tax will be shared by several parties in varying degrees, depending on the elasticities of
supply and demand for the firm's products or services, and other factors in a competitive marketplace. In most cases, the burden of a tax will be shared between the firm, its suppliers, and its customers. In almost all cases, the imposition of the tax on a firm forces it to raise its prices and harms its revenues and sales, causing economic losses. Moreover, as cases such as <cite>Twentieth Century Sporting Club</cite> demonstrate, customers' resistance to
increased prices may require firms to absorb much or all of a tax increase. Yet few common law courts have recognized this reality. It is time that they did.
<p>
<h3>6.  The European Cases: A Principled Approach</h3>

The economic model outlined in the previous section has been reflected in the European Court of Justice's treatment of the `passing on' defence. Particularly valuable are the views of the Court and the European Commission as to the placement of the onus of demonstrating whether or not the plaintiff firm has in fact `passed on' the economic burden of a tax to its customers. Following earlier decisions which outlined a nascent right to recovery of levies determined to be illegal under Community law,<sup><a href="#one39">139</a></sup> the European Court first tackled the `passing on' defence in <cite>Hans Just I/S v. Danish Ministry for Fiscal Affairs</cite>.<sup><a href="#one40">140</a></sup> A Danish alcohol producer and importer brought an action for recovery of overpayment of Danish excise taxes. It challenged the excise tax provisions on the grounds that they taxed imported products at a higher rate than domestic products and violated art. 95 of the <cite>Treaty of Rome</cite> (specifically, the principle of non-discrimination).<sup><a href="#one41">141</a></sup> In addition, the plaintiff sought repayment of what it alleged to be overpayments of excise tax under the Danish scheme. One question posed to the Court was whether European Community law contained any rules governing the repayment of
taxes deemed to be inconsistent with art. 95. More specifically, was it relevant that the producer could establish that it had suffered a loss as a result of the tax?
<p>
The Court held that the impugned excise tax legislation violated art. 95 of the <cite>Treaty of Rome</cite>. Moreover, the Court found that the relevant Danish law of unjust enrichment required that the plaintiff must demonstrate that he or she has suffered a loss in order to merit repayment of the impugned taxes. Danish law does not allow a claim to succeed against a public authority where it could be demonstrated that the economic burden of the taxes in question had been `passed on' to the business' consumers.<sup><a href="#one42">142</a></sup> Denmark argued that in such a situation, to require the repayment of taxes would unjustly enrich the plaintiff.
The Court held that Member States could design their own legal regimes for the repayment of taxes found to violate Community law, as long as the repayment regime was no less favourable to nationals from other Member States than to domestic nationals. Community law does not prevent national legal regimes from taking into consideration
whether the burden of the charges which have been unlawfully levied has been `passed on' to  others.<sup><a href="#one43">143</a></sup> <cite>Hans Just</cite> suggests that under European law, Member States may preclude reimbursement of taxes where it can be demonstrated that the burden of the taxes was `passed on' to the plaintiff's consumers.
<p>
Given this deferential approach to national law, in later cases the European Court was not concerned with whether Member States could impose conditions---such as a statutory `passing on' defence---on the repayment of taxes collected under illegal statutes. Yet the Court carefully outlined the requirements which a national scheme must meet in order to be compatible with Community law. <cite>Hans Just</cite> was soon followed by <cite>Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v. San Giorgio SpA</cite>,<sup><a href="#one44">144</a></sup> the case which contains the most sophisticated understanding of the economic forces at work in the `passing on' defence. A dairy argued that health inspection charges imposed by Italy on the transit of
animals, meat, and related products violated Community law. Italian law provided that payments of an illegal tax could not be recovered where the business had `passed on' the cost of the payments to its consumers, and that there was a presumption that such `passing on' had in fact taken place. Italy's constitutional court allowed the application, held that the charges were illegal, and ordered restitution of the payments to San Giorgio. 
<p>
The European Court's consideration of the issue focused upon San Giorgio's right to recovery of the taxes from the Italian authorities. The Court was faced with two main questions: first, whether a national law could predicate the recovery of taxes paid to a public authority under an illegal statute on certain conditions, such as the requirement that the taxpayer demonstrate that the taxes had not in fact been `passed on.'  Second, the Court considered whether the Italian legislation's requirement that the taxpayer provide documentary proof that the taxes had not been `passed on' rendered ``the exercise of rights which national courts are under a duty to protect virtually impossible.&quot;  Following its decision in <cite>Hans Just</cite>, the Court reiterated its view that Community law does not prevent Member States from implementing national schemes to regulate the repayment of taxes paid under illegal statutes. These national schemes could consider whether the taxpayer has `passed on' the cost of the taxes to its customers. Nevertheless, the Court held that national regulatory schemes were subject to the dictates of Community law. The central issue in <cite>San Giorgio</cite> was the burden of proof as to whether the taxes in question had or had not
been `passed on.'  The Court held that Community law does not permit a Member State to create an irrefutable presumption that a charge or tax has been `passed on' by the taxpayer to its customers. Nor can Member States impose the burden of proof on the taxpayer: it must be the responsibility of public authorities to demonstrate that the
taxes have in fact been `passed on' by the taxpayer to its consumers. Further, the Court held that the standard of proof must not be so high as to make it impossible for the taxpayer to demonstrate that it did not in fact `pass on' the economic burden of an impugned tax or charge. In so doing, the Court was acutely aware of the economic
difficulties in determining what proportion, if any, of the tax had actually been `passed on.'<sup><a href="#one45">145</a></sup> The complexity of the economic calculations, in the Court's opinion, require that the burden of proof not be imposed on the taxpayer. Otherwise, the vast majority of taxpayers would be effectively prevented from receiving repayment of taxes levied contrary to Community law. The Court concluded that Member States are prohibited by Community law from making the repayment of illegal charges conditional on the production of documentary evidence by the plaintiff showing that the charges were not `passed on' to its customers.
<p>
The conclusions of Mancini A.G. in <cite>San Giorgio</cite> are of particular interest, as they reinforce the economic model of `passing on' which was developed above.<sup><a href="#one46">146</a></sup> Mancini A.G. took issue with the `passing on' defence as examined in both <cite>Hans Just</cite> and in <cite>San Giorgio</cite>. To allow such a defence, he argued, would make it all but impossible for taxpayers to recover
from the government. Mancini A.G. recognized that the price paid by consumers for goods or services is composed of a number of factors, including taxes, the exact composition of which is difficult to determine. In such circumstances, it would be folly to isolate one element of the price of the good or service as being attached to a
tax paid by the plaintiff. It would also render impracticable attempts at recovery by subjecting plaintiffs to an almost insuperable task.<sup><a href="#one47">147</a></sup>
<p>
The European Court confirmed this position in two subsequent cases. In <cite>Re Repayment of Illegal Taxes</cite><sup><a href="#one48">148</a></sup> the Court examined an Italian decree-law<sup><a href="#one49">149</a></sup> which provided that repayment of taxes and charges made under legislation which was subsequently found to have been illegal was dependant on taxpayers furnishing documentary evidence that the charge or tax had not been `passed on' to other persons. The legislation was similar to that considered in <cite>San
Giorgio</cite>.<sup><a href="#one50">150</a></sup> The European Commission applied to the European Court for a declaration that the provisions were contrary to European law because the onus which they imposed on
taxpayers seeking repayment of taxes collected under illegal statutes was too severe. Slynn A.G. suggested that the Italian scheme violated the principles set down by the Court in <cite>San Giorgio</cite> for two reasons. First, the scheme imposed the onus on the taxpayer to prove that it had not `passed on' the burden of the taxes to its customers. Second, the scheme's requirement of documentary evidence made the threshold for recovery all but insurmountable.<sup><a href="#one51">151</a></sup> The Court agreed. This position was reiterated in <cite>Les Fils de Jules Bianco S.A. v. Directeur G&eacute;n&eacute;ral des Douanes et Droits Indirects</cite>,<sup><a href="#one52">152</a></sup> in which the Court considered the status of French taxes on fuel oil. The plaintiffs, French fuel oil distributors, paid the impugned taxes and subsequently challenged their legality. French legislation provided that the taxes could be recovered only where the taxpayer could demonstrate that the taxes had not been passed on to a customer. The Court held that the plaintiffs needed only to prove that the tax statute in question was unlawful and that they had paid it. The Court held:
<blockquote>
a member-State is not entitled to adopt provisions which make the repayment of charges levied contrary to Community law conditional upon the production of proof that those charges have not been passed on to the purchasers of the products that were subject to the charges and to place the burden of adducing such negative proof entirely on the natural or legal persons claiming repayment.<sup><a href="#one53">153</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Thus, the European Court, while allowing Member States to preserve the `passing on' defence as an element of their domestic law of unjust enrichment, has required that the burden of proof and evidentiary considerations not conspire to make it effectively impossible for taxpayers to recover payments made under unlawful statutes. Canadian courts would do well to adopt these principles in Canadian law.
<p>
<h3>7.  The American Cases: Defining the Scope of `Passing on'</h3>

The `passing on' defence has had a long history in the United States, largely because the American Constitution provides broad grounds for challenging the legality of tax statutes, whereas most other common law countries do not possess a similar constitutional structure.<sup><a href="#one54">154</a></sup> American courts have been generally receptive to the `passing on' defence, claiming in many cases that the plaintiff business has likely passed
on the economic burden of the tax to its customers, and that it would receive a windfall if it were allowed to recover the tax payments from the government. But as we shall see, despite this initial reluctance to allow plaintiffs to recover, some glimmers of hope have emerged. A word of caution must be said about the American cases: many of them involve the interpretation of a statutory provision defining the circumstances and procedures by which a claim for restitution of payments made under an unconstitutional statute, or overpayments under a valid statute, may be initiated. Many of these statutory regimes include a `passing on' provision.<sup><a href="#one55">155</a></sup> Notwithstanding this <i>caveat</i>, some broader lessons can be drawn from the decisions. For the most part, the U.S. courts have given a wide scope to their pronouncements, and have not limited their holdings to narrow questions of statutory interpretation confined to the individual case. In any event, in the absence of a well-developed common law in Canada on the `passing on' defence, some guidance may be gained from the U.S. decisions. 
<p>
This dominant strain in the U.S. law is manifest in <cite>Bacchus Imports, Ltd</cite>. v. <cite>Dias</cite>.<sup><a href="#one56">156</a></sup> Four wholesalers sold liquor to retailers at a base price
plus a 20 per cent state excise tax. They challenged the constitutionality of the tax and sought restitution of $45,000,000 which they had paid to Hawaii under it. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the tax statute was unconstitutional.<sup><a href="#one57">157</a></sup> Hawaii contended that there should be no refund to the wholesalers because they had `passed on' the ``economic incidence&quot; of the tax to their customers through a separate addition to the price that their customers were legally obligated to pay within a certain time. Furthermore, the State argued that the retailers, and not the wholesalers, bore the legal obligation to pay the tax. By contrast,
the wholesalers claimed that they were liable to pay the tax, regardless of whether their customers had paid their bills on time. They also put forward a variant of the economic argument against `passing on' outlined above:<sup><a href="#one58">158</a></sup> that the effect of the tax (that is, having to charge a price 20 per cent higher) was more complicated than simply `passing on' the cost of the tax to retailers. The U.S. Supreme Court viewed restitution as a matter for the State Court to decide and remanded the case for trial. Dissenting on other grounds, Stevens J. (joined by Rehnquist and O'Connor JJ.), was skeptical as to the ability of the wholesalers to
demonstrate that the discriminatory tax had had an adverse impact on their business. While the wholesalers challenged the entire regulatory scheme by arguing that these exemptions were discriminatory, the dissent was convinced that wholesalers had `passed on' the economic burden of the tax to their customers. The case demonstrates that the American courts have been keen to ensure that where a plaintiff is seeking restitution against the government for illegal taxation payments, the plaintiff is not awarded a &quot;windfall.&quot;<sup><a href="#one59">159</a></sup> Courts are reluctant to award restitution in cases in which the plaintiff firm collects taxes from its customers on behalf of a public authority.
<p>
A similar result was reached in <cite>Jefferson Electric</cite>.<sup><a href="#one60">160</a></sup> The Court held that the proper interpretation of a legislative provision regulating the refund of certain automobile taxes was that a prospective recipient of a tax refund had to demonstrate that the burden of the tax had not been `passed on' to its customers. In the Court's view, while the government had likely been unjustly enriched by receipt of the tax
payments, to allow a refund in these circumstances would be unjust enrichment of a different sort. Van Deventer J. stated that &quot;we cannot assent to the view that a court may give a judgment awarding a taxpayer a refund without inquiring whether he has borne the burden of the tax or has reimbursed himself by collecting it from the
purchaser.&quot;<sup><a href="#one61">161</a></sup> 
<p>
It is useful to turn to a series of older Illinois cases in which the `passing on' defence was examined in some detail. The defence was approved in <cite>Chicago Motor Club v. Kinney</cite>,<sup><a href="#one62">162</a></sup> where the applicant sought a declaration that an Illinois motor fuel tax was unconstitutional. The legislation provided a refund of two cents per gallon of tax which would otherwise be payable, if the gasoline were used &quot;for any purpose other than operating a motor vehicle upon the public highways.&quot;  The tax was imposed on distributors and refiners of motor fuel. The Supreme Court of
Illinois held that the statute was unconstitutional, but refused to allow recovery of taxes paid under the statute because the tax &quot;is merely one of the items of cost to the distributor and it enters into the cost to the ultimate consumer just as any other item does.&quot;<sup><a href="#one63">163</a></sup> The State, which
would ordinarily be required to disgorge the payments made under an invalid statute, was not required to do so because the Court considered that the distributors had likely `passed on' the cost of the tax to their customers. 
<p>
This rule was followed in a series of cases arising out of the determination that the Illinois motor fuel legislation was
unconstitutional. In <cite>Richardson Lubricating Co. v. Kinney</cite>,<sup><a href="#one64">164</a></sup> two motor fuel distributors sought restitution of tax payments made under the
invalidated Illinois statute, but were refused on the grounds that they had not borne the burden of the tax. The Court was unimpressed that the distributors had not offered to return the tax payments to their customers should they be awarded a refund. In a companion case,<sup><a href="#one65">165</a></sup> the Court again allowed the `passing on' defence to be advanced. In denying recovery of the tax payments from the State, the Court held that the motor fuel distributor: 
<blockquote>
acted merely as an intermediary between its customers and the department of finance. It paid the tax, not out of its own funds, but by the collections from its customers for the particular purpose. It now seeks to recover what it has not refunded, and does not intend to refund to its customers.<sup><a href="#one66">166</a></sup>
</blockquote>
In <cite>Standard Oil Co. v. Bollinger (No.2)</cite>,<sup><a href="#one67">167</a></sup> the petitioning oil company objected to this characterization, arguing that it had agreed with certain of its customers, to whom it had `passed on' the unconstitutional tax in question, to attempt to recover the taxes so paid on their behalf and to return the tax payments to the customers on a <i>pro rata</i> basis. Again, the Supreme Court of Illinois denied recovery and condemned what it viewed as the petitioner's opportunistic behaviour on the part of the petitioner. In all of the Illinois motor fuel tax cases the Court was clearly apprehensive about awarding what it saw
as a windfall to distributors, and allowed the `passing on' defence to be advanced to prevent this.
<p>
In a final case in the series, <cite>Benzoline Motor Fuel Co. v. Bollinger</cite>,<sup><a href="#one68">168</a></sup> the Court moderated its refusal to allow recovery. There, the petitioning fuel
company had held a conference with its customers soon after the impugned act went into effect. Furthermore, the company kept accurate records of the amount of fuel sold to its customers, along with their names, addresses, and the amount of tax each had paid. The Court held that here the customers had agreed that the taxes should be paid by the fuel company under protest, and that records were maintained by the plaintiff  &quot;in order that it would be able to make full and proper returns of tax money in the event the money was returned to it by the  state.&quot;<sup><a href="#one69">169</a></sup> This situation was different from the earlier cases concerning recovery of the fuel tax. The Court ordered restitution of the tax payments, declaring that the State director of finance: 
<blockquote>
is in control of money that in equity and good conscience he has no right to retain, inasmuch as the avenue for the return of the tax money in full to the customers of complainant, without any deductions, is straight and broad.<sup><a href="#one70">170</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The Court was prepared to reject the `passing on' defence, and order restitution to a business which had `passed on' the burden of a tax, where there was a continuing relationship between the firm and its customers, and where the business had kept adequate records which would enable it to return the tax payments to its customers. 
<p>
Conversely, the `passing on' defence was also upheld in <cite>Shannon v. Hughes &amp; Co.,</cite><sup><a href="#one71">171</a></sup> in which an ice cream manufacturer challenged the constitutionality of a Kentucky tax of seven cents per quart on the sale of ice cream. The plaintiff had collected the tax from its customers and forwarded it to the State, as required by the statute. The case is analogous to the tax on
alcoholic beverages in <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite>, in that the plaintiff in both cases was under a statutory obligation to collect the tax from its customers on behalf of the government. The State asserted that even if the tax statute was unconstitutional and void, the plaintiff, having recovered the tax from its customers, should
not be able to recover the tax payments from it. The Court found that the plaintiff &quot;added the tax to the price charged for its products, and thus collected the tax from its vendees and shifted to them the economic burden of its imposition.&quot;<sup><a href="#one72">172</a></sup> The Court followed <cite>Jefferson Electric</cite><sup><a href="#one73">173</a></sup> in holding that the State may require the plaintiff to demonstrate that it has not `passed on' the burden of the tax to its customers as a pre-condition for recovery of
taxes unlawfully collected.
<p>
The Court, stating that &quot;[t]he doctrine of unjust enrichment has received a wide application in tax cases even without the aid of a statute,&quot; followed the Illinois motor fuel cases discussed above, and denied recovery to the plaintiff. Although the plaintiff was under a duty to collect the tax in question on behalf of the State, it could not be considered a &quot;taxpayer&quot; for the purpose of the statutory recovery provision, which stated that the customers alone could recover. Rees J. stated:
<blockquote>
the sellers of ice cream who paid the tax into the state treasury should show that the amounts they seek to recover do not include collections made by them from their customers ... [t]o hold otherwise would be manifestly unjust and would result in the unjust enrichment of the one seeking to recover the tax from the [state] and supported by no outlay on his part. Indirectly it would allow him to take money wrongfully paid into the treasury of the [state] by another through himself acting as collector, and leave the actual payer of the tax with a bare cupboard.<sup><a href="#one74">174</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The plaintiff put forward the economic argument discussed above,<sup><a href="#one75">175</a></sup> arguing that the imposition of the tax had injured its business due to a drastic decline in volume of sales,
such that it should be permitted to sue the State in order to recoup these losses, given that the impugned statute had been deemed to be unconstitutional. The Court quickly dismissed this suggestion on the grounds that this would be to allow an action against the State for losses stemming from the effects of taxation. But it is unclear why
this should be a bar to an action when the tax statute was entirely invalid and unconstitutional. Moreover, the tax here was not set out as a &quot;specific charge&quot; to customers, but was included in the total undifferentiated price. I argue below that the `passing on' defence is considerably weaker in situations where a tax was not
&quot;specifically charged&quot; to customers as a distinct item.
<p>
The pessimism which emerges from a reading of these cases is allayed considerably by a line of cases beginning with <cite>123 East Fifty-Fourth Street</cite>,<sup><a href="#one76">176</a></sup> in which the majority rejected the application of the `passing on' defence. A restaurant at that address in New York City sought recovery of a federal excise tax which had been levied against it in error. A 5 per cent surcharge was levied separately on all admission, refreshment, service, and merchandise charges on which the restaurant had collected tax from its
customers and paid to the federal government. The statutory provision did not limit recovery of tax payments illegally collected to taxpayers who had borne the burden of the taxes paid. For its part, the federal government argued that Congress could not have intended that the restaurant should secure the &quot;windfall&quot; which
would result if the tax payments were returned to it. The restaurant was liable under statute for the payment of the taxes, regardless of whether they were actually recovered by it through `passing on' to its customers. The Court held that although the restaurant's customers had undoubtedly paid more for food, drink, and entertainment than they would have had there had never been a tax, the fact that the restaurant had `passed on' the tax to its customers
meant that when the higher price (including the `passed on' tax) was paid, &quot;that price became the plaintiff's money.&quot;<sup><a href="#one77">177</a></sup> As a result, the majority held that the customers would have no right of action against the plaintiff for their overpayments. Chase J. allowed the restaurant to recover on
the basis that the money belonged to it when it was transmitted to the government.
<p>
Learned Hand J. issued a strong dissent in this case. He made a distinction between two forms in which the tax might have been presented to customers by the plaintiff. It could be inferred that the restaurant had charged its customers by presenting them with a bill indicating the amount payable, with the tax added on as a separate and distinct charge. He contrasted this with the situation (which he did not believe had occurred here) in which the restaurant might have presented its customers with a `lump sum' bill showing a single sum payable with all taxes included. He regarded the distinction between the two cases as &quot;crucial&quot;; if the latter situation obtained, Learned Hand J. suggested that he would have agreed with the majority that the customers had no claim to the
money, and would have allowed recovery for the plaintiff. If, however, as he believed was the case here, the former situation had transpired, and the restaurant had represented the tax to its customers as a separate and distinct charge on top of the regular price, it would be &quot;understood to be a statement that it [the restaurant] was obliged to pay it as a tax&quot; on behalf of the customers to the government. That is, it could be implied that the restaurant had agreed to accept the tax payments from its customers only on the condition that it be forwarded to the government in fulfillment of statutory obligations. Learned Hand J. would have held that the payments should be returned to the plaintiff and held on constructive trust by it for the benefit of its customers. The restaurant could not recover unless it could locate the customers who had paid the tax and repay the money to them.
<p>
This distinction of form is determinative, and shows that <cite>Shannon</cite> was wrongly decided.<sup><a href="#one78">178</a></sup> (Recall that in that case, the Court denied recovery to the plaintiff even though the tax had not been specifically charged to customers.)  The manner in which the tax was presented to the customers should affect whether the plaintiff firm recovers the payment from the government, and whether the plaintiff can keep the money outright or must hold it under a constructive trust. If the customers knew that a discernible portion of the price which they were paying for the plaintiff's goods or services was a tax, it can be logically inferred that they agreed to pay the plaintiff's price plus the tax, and paid the tax on the condition that it be actually forwarded to the government by the plaintiff. If it were subsequently determined that the tax was unlawful, then the moneys recovered should be returned to the plaintiff and held on constructive trust for those of its customers who paid the tax. If, however, the plaintiff's price was presented to the customer as an undifferentiated lump sum---as in <cite>Allied Air Conditioning</cite>---it becomes far more difficult to argue that the customer should have a
claim on the portion of the price which actually (but unbeknownst to the customer) consisted of the `passed on' tax payment, because it may be safely inferred that the plaintiff's customers would have paid that lump sum price regardless of whether they knew that it included a tax charge. In the latter case the customer was not making a tax
payment <i>qua</i> tax payment, and the plaintiff firm should recover from the government, but be under no obligation to advance the proceeds to its customers. 
<p>
Suppose that on the facts of <cite>Air Canada</cite>, the Supreme Court of Canada had allowed the airlines to recover on the basis of unjust enrichment. Could passengers who had paid a portion of the tax (because the airlines had likely `passed on' at least part of the cost of the impugned fuel tax to them) then launch their own action
in unjust enrichment against the airlines?  <cite>Wayne County Produce Co</cite>. v. <cite>Duffy-Mott Co</cite>.<sup><a href="#one79">179</a></sup> provides an answer to the problem which arises when a party to whom the cost of a tax has been `passed on' seeks recovery of that burden from a business which has successfully recovered tax payments from the government. The plaintiff had purchased more than 157,000 gallons of sweet cider from the defendant. The plaintiff had paid the defendant both a base price as well as a 10 per cent war tax, which the defendant had transmitted to the federal government. The U.S. Treasury Department's application of the war tax to sweet cider was subsequently determined to have been erroneous. The defendant demanded and received a refund of the taxes from the government. The plaintiff then sought recovery of the tax payments which it had made to the defendant. Cardozo C.J. ordered recovery for the plaintiff. He distinguished an early New York decision, <cite>Moore v. Des Arts</cite>,<sup><a href="#one80">180</a></sup> where the tax in question had been paid by the producer and &quot;absorbed in a total or composite price to be paid at all events.&quot; In <cite>Moore</cite>, the tax had been paid by the business on an input, and then the cost of that tax had been `passed on' to the business' customers. In such a situation, a buyer in the position of the plaintiff would be without a remedy, even through ``the annulment of the tax may increase the profit to the seller.&quot;  Interestingly, this is exactly the situation in <cite>Air Canada</cite>, where La Forest J. did not allow recovery.<sup><a href="#one81">181</a></sup>
<p>
In <cite>Duffy-Mott</cite>, the tax was entirely distinct from the cider; it was a per gallon tax payable by the consumer through the producer, who would forward the taxes thus paid to the government. The Court held that the contract between the parties was an essential consideration. The consumer was obligated to pay the taxes for which
the seller was liable, on the implied condition that if the tax was later determined not to be payable, the tax payment should be returned by the seller to the consumer. If the seller had not &quot;specifically charged&quot; the tax as a distinct sum, the customer could not have recovered. In a situation where the firm recovered a tax from the government, it has no valid defence against an action from one of its customers for restitution of the portion of the tax which the customer actually paid. The <cite>Duffy-Mott</cite> approach, combined with the reasoning of Learned Hand J. in his dissenting judgment in <cite>123 East Fifty-Fourth Street</cite>, contains principles
which lead us to a solution to the `passing on' problem.
<p>
<h3>8.  A Solution?</h3>

An innovative solution to the problems raised by the `passing on' defence is contained in the judgment of Traynor J. of the Supreme Court of California in the <cite>Decorative Carpets</cite><sup><a href="#one82">182</a></sup> case. A tax upon the sale and installation of carpeting was miscalculated, so that a carpet vendor collected sales tax from its customers, and overpaid to the State in excess of $4,300,000. The vendor sought recovery of this money, and was granted it at trial on the basis that it was retained in error by the State. That the vendor had no intention of returning the overpayments recovered from the State to the customers who had actually paid it did not concern the trial court. But on appeal, the State contended that the vendor would be unjustly enriched if it were allowed to keep the tax overpayments.
<p>
In an effort to balance the competing considerations at issue, Traynor J. adopted Learned Hand J.'s dissent in <cite>123 East Fifty-Fourth Street,</cite> and held that the State should return the tax overpayments to the vendor, but that the vendor must hold the overpayments on trust for the customers who had actually made the payments. This approach is useful, as it requires the State to disgorge payments which would be unjust for it to retain. Yet it
avoids a &quot;windfall&quot; for the plaintiff by requiring that the vendor hold the payments on constructive trust for the customers who bore the burden of the tax. Traynor J.'s decision was no doubt assisted by the trial testimony of the president of the vendor firm that it had retained invoices showing the names and addresses of all 882 customers who had paid the sales tax overpayment. Indeed, the case was remanded to the trial court &quot;with directions to enter judgment for plaintiff only if it submits proof satisfactory to the court that the refund will be returned to plaintiff's customers from whom the excess payments were erroneously  collected.&quot;<sup><a href="#one83">183</a></sup> In these circumstances, it would be a relatively easy matter to return the overpayments to the customers, and the result seems just and enlightened. But it is also evident that such information may be available in only a few cases, possibly limiting the applicability of the <cite>Decorative Carpets</cite> approach. On the facts of <cite>Shannon</cite>, for example, involving many thousands of customers about whom there may be very little information, and a relatively small amount of money paid by each customer, the <cite>Decorative Carpets</cite> approach would certainly be much more difficult to apply. Similarly, on the facts of <cite>123 East Fifty-Fourth Street</cite>, it is unclear how a requirement that the restaurant hold the tax payments in question on trust for those customers who had made them would help resolve the situation, because in all likelihood there would be no way to trace any of the customers who had paid the tax. 
 <p>
<h3>9.  Re-Ordering `Passing On'</h3>

The potential application of the `passing on' defence may arise in three different ways. I argue that in all three situations, the plaintiff taxpayer should recover against the government, but certain conditions may apply to this recovery. My later discussion examines what should happen after the plaintiff firm recovers from the public authority, and analyzes the proper relationship between the plaintiff and its customers. In all of these cases, we must suppose that the government has received tax payments from the plaintiff firm under a statute which has subsequently been ruled <i>ultra vires</i> or unconstitutional. The first situation involves cases in which the plaintiff firm has acted as a tax collection agent for the government. In such cases, a public authority has imposed a
statutory obligation on the plaintiff firm to collect the taxes and forward the proceeds to it. Such a tax (a sales tax) usually applies to the final product produced by the firm, and the firm applies it as a surcharge on the bills given to its customers. In this type of case, the courts should apply the <cite>Decorative Carpets</cite> solution, which is to order that the government return the tax payments to the plaintiff firm, but that the plaintiff must hold these  payments on constructive trust for those of its customers who actually paid the tax. A constructive trust is imposed because it would be unjust enrichment as between the customers and the firm for the tax payments to be retained by the firm alone. A constructive trust is imposed to prevent unjust enrichment.<sup><a href="#one84">184</a></sup> As a corollary, the <cite>Duffy-Mott</cite> rule must also apply. Customers of the plaintiff who actually paid the tax in question must be able to sue the plaintiff firm to recover their portion of the tax moneys recovered.
<p>
This approach views the plaintiff firm as a conduit through which the tax payments may be returned to the customers who bore the economic burden of the tax.<sup><a href="#one85">185</a></sup> It ensures both that the public authority does not retain the enrichment to which it has no entitlement, and also that the moneys are returned to the parties who actually made the payments. It could be objected that it would be unfair to impose the responsibility of a constructive trust on the plaintiff firm. Yet in situations where it is feasible to impose a constructive trust, it is feasible precisely because accurate records are available and the customers who paid the
tax may be identified, as in <cite>Decorative Carpets</cite>, and thus, the burden would not be particularly onerous. In any event, it was not unfair for the government to impose the trust relationship on the plaintiff in the first place,<sup><a href="#one86">186</a></sup> so it is not clear why it would now be unfair for the court to impose such a trust relationship as a remedy. Another concern is that the firm would seem to face little incentive
to bring actions for recovery of tax where they would not benefit from any recovery because obliged to hold the proceeds on constructive trust for their customers. There are two responses to this. First, the constructive trust should not be of indefinite duration. After some reasonable period of time, the plaintiff should be entitled to retain unclaimed funds which it is holding on trust, and keep them for its own benefit. Second, it may be that the firm
has bargained with some or all of its customers to press their claim, so it may be compensated by them for doing so.<sup><a href="#one87">187</a></sup> Thus, firms are likely to face incentives to bring actions against the government for recovery of taxes even where they must hold the proceeds on constructive trust for their customers for a period of time. Furthermore, given these incentives, the plaintiff firm is likely to be a more efficient agent to return the tax payments to the customers than is the public authority.
<p>
The second class of cases are those in which, as in the first class, the plaintiff firm has acted as a tax collector for the government. But here, either the tax was not presented to the customers as a separate item on their bills or invoices, or else other factors ensure that the <cite>Decorative Carpets</cite> solution of a constructive trust is impracticable. As was outlined above,<sup><a href="#one88">188</a></sup> in many situations, the favourable factors present in <cite>Decorative Carpets</cite> ---such as a small number of identifiable customers, and a relatively large amount of tax paid by each customer---will be absent. Of the cases which we have examined, the alcoholic beverage tax in <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite> and the ice cream tax in <cite>Shannon</cite> are of this type. At first blush, this class of cases presents grave difficulties, such that a plaintiff may avoid making a claim in unjust enrichment at all.<sup><a href="#one89">189</a></sup> It is unlikely that there will be adequate information on the customers who actually paid the tax, making it potentially arduous to return the tax payments to
individual customers. Further, although the total amount of the tax payments may be considerable, the amount of money at stake for any given consumer who paid the tax may be small, so that individual consumers will have little incentive to seek recovery of their portion of the total tax payment. Nevertheless, it is my view that the <cite>Decorative Carpets</cite> remedy should still apply. Even where it may seem unlikely that the ultimate customers will `get their money back,' and that the plaintiff firm will receive a &quot;windfall,&quot; restitution should still be ordered. 
<p>
Three factors support this argument. First, the rules of civil procedure in several provinces permit class action suits to be brought,<sup><a href="#one90">190</a></sup> which ensures that if the total amount of money at stake is substantial, then there will be an incentive for a litigant representing the class of customers who paid the tax to seek
restitution from the plaintiff firm who has recovered from the government. This would be the case even if the amount of tax paid by any one customer is relatively small. Thus, the <cite>Duffy-Mott</cite> situation could apply even where litigants are relatively dispersed, and have a small individual interest in the litigation. Second, the
policy considerations motivating Wilson J. in her dissent in <cite>Air Canada</cite>, and Professor Birks in his writing on the subject---that there are overwhelming constitutional reasons why a government must not benefit from illegal taxation statutes by remaining unjustly enriched despite a finding of illegality---are compelling and should
make courts lean to a presumption of restitution in cases concerning tax payments to public authorities under invalid statutes. In this vein, the Law Commission in England has noted that the likely result of allowing a `passing on' defence is to enrich the government despite its having acted unlawfully.<sup><a href="#one91">191</a></sup> If awarding the occasional &quot;windfall&quot; to plaintiff firms is the price which must be paid to support this fundamental constitutional principle, then perhaps it is not an undue one. 
<p>
Professor Arrowsmith has argued that the `passing on' defence should be allowed only in situations where the enrichment was gained through &quot;duress&quot; on the part of the defendant public authority.<sup><a href="#one92">192</a></sup> As a result, she approves of the application of the defence by the majority in <cite>Air Canada</cite>, presumably on the grounds that <cite>Air Canada</cite> did not involve duress. She would not allow the defence to be advanced where the public authority's enrichment arose through duress, as in <cite>Mason</cite>.<sup><a href="#one93">193</a></sup> This argument is untenable. First, on the facts of the case, it may be argued that there was in fact duress (or reasonable apprehension thereof) in <cite>Air Canada</cite>. The broader point is that duress however, is generally an unhelpful concept in explaining cases for recovery of unlawful tax. More fundamentally, the thrust of the most recent developments in the law of restitution for payments made to public authorities under an <i>ultra vires</i> or unconstitutional statute, as exemplified by
<cite>Woolwich Equitable Building Society</cite>, is that the relationship between public authorities and private citizens should be governed by the requirement that the government must not be permitted to retain the fruits of unlawful action. If one adopts this view, then the problem involved in determining whether duress applies in a
particular situation---and the artificiality of implying duress into particular transactions---disappears. This is particularly true where the dispute centres around the imposition of a tax by a public authority: one need not be a libertarian to believe that &quot;the power to tax involves the power to destroy.&quot;<sup><a href="#one94">194</a></sup>
<p>
Third, as suggested above,<sup><a href="#one95">195</a></sup> the imposition of the illegal tax has likely had an adverse effect on the plaintiff's business, even if the plaintiff has not actually borne the burden of the tax, either because it acted as a tax collection agent, or else `passed on' the burden to its customers. Allowing recovery from the government can go some way toward compensating, if only roughly, for this loss. Strictly speaking, of course, there may be only an indirect relationship between the value of the taxation payments at stake, and the plaintiff's losses due to the imposition of an illegal tax, so that it might be argued that the plaintiff should instead pursue two separate actions: first, an action in unjust enrichment for recovery of the tax payments made to the public authority under the invalid statute (even if these amounts subsequently become the object of a restitutionary action launched by the firm's customers as in <cite>Duffy-Mott</cite>); and second, an action against the government in tort to recover for losses suffered by it due to &quot;wrongful taxation.&quot;<sup><a href="#one96">196</a></sup> It will be recalled that it is extremely difficult to determine the exact loss caused to a firm stemming from having an illegal tax imposed on it. A rule requiring the public authority to disgorge the entire tax payment would have a
valuable dual effect. It would compensate the plaintiff for its loss (even if the risk of overcompensation remained), thus avoiding difficult, expensive and often fruitless attempts to determine the precise loss caused to the plaintiff. Second, it would provide a powerful affirmation of the constitutional principle that public authorities must not benefit from unconstitutional acts.
<p>
The third class of cases are exemplified by the situation in <cite>Air Canada</cite>, in which the government imposed a tax on an input in the plaintiff's business. In <cite>Air Canada</cite>, this was a tax on aviation fuel. The province did not charge the tax on a per customer basis; the tax was charged to the plaintiff airlines on the aviation fuel alone. When the airlines invariably `passed on' the cost of the tax to their customers, the tax was not presented as a separate charge to customers. Similarly, the tax on aircraft parts and equipment in <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite> was of this type. In such a situation, the court should <i>always</i> order restitution,
even though to do so may in effect provide a &quot;windfall&quot; to the plaintiff. But note that ordering restitution provides a &quot;windfall&quot; only <i>as between the plaintiff and its customers</i>. As between the government and the plaintiff, the government has unquestionably been unjustly enriched at the plaintiff's expense.
The fact that the plaintiff may have `passed on' the burden of the tax to its customers is irrelevant as between the two parties in the lawsuit. It may of course be very relevant in a lawsuit brought by the customers against the firm for recovery of the tax payments, but that is another matter.<sup><a href="#one97">197</a></sup> In part, the impulse behind the `passing on' defence is a valid one, namely a concern that the plaintiff's customers may ultimately have a better claim on the payments than the plaintiff itself. But this does not change the fact that as between the plaintiff firm and the public authority, the latter's claim pales.
  <p>
The use of a constructive trust imposed on the funds returned to the plaintiff by the government raises an important question. What should be done with funds which remain after the plaintiff has made good faith efforts to return them to its customers?  The issue was considered by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in <cite>Illinois Bell Telephone Co</cite>. v. <cite>Slattery</cite>.<sup><a href="#one98">198</a></sup> The U.S. Supreme Court had previously determined that the telephone company had made illegal overcharges and ordered it to repay these amounts to its customers.<sup><a href="#one99">199</a></sup> The telephone company made good faith efforts to locate its customers in order to pay the refunds, but because some customers could not be located, some unrefunded moneys remained. When the limitation period expired, the telephone company sought both to be discharged from the obligation to make any more refunds, and also to retain the money for its own use. The State of Illinois argued that the remaining funds must be retained in trust for the unlocated customers, or else be forfeited to the State as <i>bona vacantia</i>, under which personal property without an owner reverts to the sovereign. But the Court rejected the application of the doctrine here, on the basis that the customers were creditors of the telephone company, and that the debts dissolved on the expiration of the limitation period. The remaining funds were held to be the property of the telephone company.
<p>
However, in a California case, concerning moneys resulting from a determination that a streetcar company in San Francisco had been unlawfully charging a seven cent fare instead of a six cent fare, it was held that the moneys should revert to the city, and not the company. In <cite>Market Street Railway Co</cite>. v. <cite>Railroad
Commission</cite>,<sup><a href="#twohundred">200</a></sup> the illegal fare resulted in a surplus of some $705,000 over what would have been collected under a legal fare. Of this, almost $12,000 was returned to customers, leaving $693,000 in an uncertain state. The streetcar company, relying on <cite>Illinois Bell Telephone Co</cite>.,<sup><a href="#two01">201</a></sup> sought a declaration that the unrefunded moneys were its property. The Court held that the moneys should be given to the city, in the belief that this was the most effective way to return the money to &quot;the people of the city.&quot; Edmonds J. in dissent argued that the customers had abandoned the excess fare to the streetcar company by not seeking refunds within the limitation period. In my view, <cite>Illinois Bell Telephone Co.</cite> is the preferable approach. Where there are remaining moneys after good faith efforts to return tax payments to customers, the moneys should be retained by the plaintiff firm who recovered them from the government.<sup><a href="#two02">202</a></sup> This approach provides an incentive for plaintiffs to press suits against the government, while ensuring that where appropriate customers are permitted to recover against the plaintiff firm.
<p>
The European cases point to a final consideration: the burden of proof. The Supreme Court of Canada in <cite>Air Canada</cite> and <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite> and the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <cite>Allied Air Conditioning</cite> were all of the opinion that the plaintiffs in an action for restitution of taxes unlawfully collected bear a burden of demonstrating not only that the enrichment in question has been at their expense, but that in addition, they did not `pass on' the burden of the tax to their customers. Clearly, it is my view that `passing on' has little merit as a defence. But at the very least the courts should create a rebuttable presumption that a payment of tax to a public authority under an illegal or <i>ultra vires</i> statute is a deprivation on the part of the person who paid the tax. Under this approach, it would be incumbent upon the public authority advancing the `passing on' defence to demonstrate that the burden of the tax payments had actually been borne by the plaintiff's customers through direct and specific `passing on.'  As cases such as <cite>Hans Just, San Giorgio, Re Repayment of Illegal Taxes,</cite> and <cite>Fils de Jules Bianco</cite> make clear, the onus should be placed on the government to demonstrate `passing on,' because the imposition of the burden of proof on the plaintiff seeking
restitution is all too often a burden which is extremely difficult to discharge. It must be remembered that it is the public authority which has &quot;received payments which it was not entitled to demand and presumptively to retain.&quot;<sup><a href="#two03">203</a></sup> It is the public authority which should bear the burden of advancing its defence. If a broad scope is given to the `passing on' defence, the emerging principle that a public authority must not retain tax payments acquired under an unconstitutional or <i>ultra vires</i> statute will be seriously compromised.
<p>
<h3>10.  Conclusion</h3>

The law regulating the recovery of unlawfully collected taxes is in danger of diverging from the general principles of unjust enrichment. This unsound development is due largely to the acceptance of defences such as `passing on,' and should be resisted. A primary culprit has been the Supreme Court of Canada's willingness to embrace the `passing on' defence. The Supreme Court's own decisions in <cite>Air Canada</cite> and <cite>Canadian Pacific Airlines</cite> appear contradictory, and have led to considerable confusion, as <cite>Allied Air  Conditioning</cite> and other recent decisions indicate. In my view, the `passing on' defence should be rejected, because it undermines general restitutionary principles, has an unsound economic basis, and strikes at the heart of constitutional government. The European and American experience make this clear. The better approach would be for the Supreme Court of Canada to reject the `passing on' defence altogether, and enunciate a clear general right
of recovery for taxes collected without a legal basis, as the House of Lords did in <cite>Woolwich Equitable Building Society</cite>. In certain limited situations it will be appropriate to require that a tax refund be held on constructive trust for the plaintiff firm's customers. But concern for the plaintiff's customers should not allow the government to retain the tax payments in the first place, to which it has no valid claim whatsoever. Only in this way will the values of restitution be upheld, as well as the important constitutional principles which militate against the government's retention of unlawfully collected taxation.

Its function is to ensure that where a plaintiff has been deprived of wealth that is either in his possession or would have accrued for his benefit, it is
restored to him. The measure of restitutionary recovery is the gain the province made at the airlines' expense.

<li><a name="sixty3">In <cite>Air Canada</cite>,</a> <i>supra</i> note 21 at 1204--1205, La Forest J. discusses the difficulties which arose in the United States after a provision eliminating the mistake of law/mistake of fact distinction was inserted into the recovery section of the Internal Revenue Code. In <cite>United States v. Butler</cite>, 297 U.S. 1 (1936), the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the <cite>Agricultural Adjustment Act</cite>, which would have led to almost $1 billion in restitutionary claims against the federal government. Congress then passed a statute which allowed recovery only where the plaintiff could demonstrate that it had not `passed on' the cost of the tax to its customers, which severely limited recovery. The difficulty in Canada, as La Forest J. notes, is that the rule in <cite>Amax Potash</cite>, <i>supra</i> note 52, would seem to preclude provinces from resorting to this legislative solution in cases of potential `fiscal chaos.'  This may be so, which
should encourage provincial governments to enact some of the other measures suggested in the text, such as limitation periods, to regulate recovery of unlawful taxes. The great irony, as Professor Arrowsmith notes (&quot;Restitution and Mistake of Law in Canada [Case Comment]&quot; (1990) 106 L.Q.R. 28 at 32) is that <cite>Amax Potash</cite>'s strong rule against legislatures attempting to secure the fruits of invalid action by other means, ends up justifying the draconian limits on the right to recovery of unlawful taxes by seeming to preclude the legislative option in cases where recovery would be severely prejudicial to the public finances.

rules for limiting the liability of public authorities to actions in restitution for repayment of taxes. These include a `no retrospective effect' rule (recovery would be restricted to those plaintiffs who had sought recovery of the payments before the payments were held to be invalid), a change of position defence, short limitation periods, or legislation precluding recovery. Woodward, <i>supra</i> note 30 at 929, suggests that in certain cases, courts should allow public authorities to repay in installments in order to minimize fiscal disruption.
<p>
<li><a name="seventy">See Collins,</a> <i>supra</i> note 2 at 429--437. The suggestion that it would be an

<p>
<li><a name="one07">There is some dispute</a> as to whether the `passing on' defence may also apply where the defendant is not a public authority. Burrows, <i>supra</i> note 28 at 59, indicates that `passing on' &quot;has been advocated exclusively for public authorities.&quot;  Yet in <cite>The Law of Restitution</cite>, <i>supra</i> note 6 at 476, Burrows interprets the majority decision in <cite>Air Canada</cite> to hold that `passing on' is a valid defence for public authorities &quot;although apparently not confined to such a defendant.&quot;  In my view, the `passing on' defence may be raised by public authorities alone because only they are in a position to impose a trust-like obligation on a business in requiring it to collect tax payments from its customers for the public authority's benefit.
<p>
<li><a name="one08">A case which seems to</a> suggest that `passing on' is available to private parties as a defence in a restitutionary action is <cite>Linz v. Electric Wire Co. of Palestine</cite>, [1948] A.C. 371 (P.C.) [hereinafter <cite>Linz</cite>]. The plaintiff purchased shares in the defendant company and later sold them at a loss to a third party. It was then discovered that the company resolution under which the shares had been issued had been invalid. The plaintiff sought recovery of the money she had paid for the shares, arguing that she had received no consideration from the defendant for her money. She also made it clear that if she recovered from the defendant, she did not intend to relinquish the money she had received when she sold her shares to the third party.
The plaintiff's claim was dismissed on the grounds that she had received consideration for her initial outlay of money in the form of the money she had received when she finally sold the shares, albeit at a loss. Lord Simonds noted that the plaintiff's rights against the company &quot;must be the same whether she sold them [the shares] at
their par value or for more or less&quot; (at 377). On one view, the case can be seen as endorsing the position that a party who has suffered a loss, but had `passed on' the loss to a third party, should not be able to bring an action in restitution against the party who was enriched at her expense. Commentators, however, have been very critical of <cite>Linz</cite>, on the grounds that it relies on a defective `no consideration' form of reasoning: see Birks, <cite>An Introduction to the Law of Restitution</cite>, <i>supra</i> note 6 at 248; Goff &amp; Jones,  <i>supra</i> note 6 at 402. It does not provide a strong ground for the argument that a `passing on' defence is
available to private defendants.

<li><a name="one09">&quot;Subjective devaluation&quot;</a> embodies the idea that benefit may be a subjective concept. For example, if A cleans B's car, B may argue that she has not been enriched because she prefers to drive a dirty car. If A mistakenly leaves $100 in B's car, however, B cannot dispute that she has been
enriched, because by definition as a medium of exchange, money cannot be subjectively devalued: Birks, <cite>An Introduction to the Law of Restitution</cite>, <i>supra</i> note 6 at 109--114.

He wore his uniform so that the trucks would not be inspected by the military police. When caught, the money he had received was seized. He later brought an action in unjust enrichment for recovery of the money. The House of Lords held that he could not recover, even though the Crown had &quot;lost no profits or suffered no damage.&quot; Lord Porter held that &quot;[i]t is the receipt and possession of the money that matters, not the loss or prejudice to the master [<i>i.e</i>. the Crown]&quot; (at 516).

The plaintiff, an adjoining landowner, brought suit, alleging that part of the cave was under his land, such that the defendants had been unjustly enriched.

The manufacturer of a rocker swing sought a declaration that its product was a &quot;swing&quot; and thus exempt from purchase tax. The Commissioners disputed this, and the manufacturer paid the tax. In the interim, the manufacturer sold some of the rocker swings to customers at a price including the disputed purchase tax. The customers could no longer be traced. The manufacturer brought an action seeking recovery of the purchase tax which it had paid, but only sought to recover the tax attributable to the unsold rocker swings. The issue of passing on was thus neatly avoided, in that the plaintiff sought recovery only for those tax payments which it had not passed on to its customers. The manufacturer was awarded recovery.

<h1>The Change of Position Defence in Restitution

Although almost all common law jurisdictions now allow claims in restitution (or &quot;unjust  enrichment&quot;) to be resisted by a &quot;change of position&quot; defence, considerable disagreement exists
with respect to the defence's conceptual basis. As long as the principle underlying the defence remains unclear, the law will be uncertain. In order to determine who can invoke the defence, and in what situations, it is necessary to have an understanding of why the defence exists and what it is supposed to accomplish. In this paper, the author considers the two leading understandings of the defence: the idea that the defence is based on considerations of equity and fairness between the parties, and the alternative view that the defence is rooted in the nature of the defendant's enrichment. The author argues that while neither explanation is completely free of problems, the enrichment-based understanding provides a more coherent and logical basis for the change of position defence.
<p>
Bien que, dans presque tous les ressorts de common law, le fait d'avoir modifi&eacute; sa situation constitue un moyen de d&eacute;fense contre une action en restitution, les avis sont partag&eacute;s quant aux assises th&eacute;oriques de cette d&eacute;fense. Aussi longtemps que les principes sous-jacents demeureront incertains, l'&eacute;tat du droit le sera &eacute;galement, car on ne peut d&eacute;terminer, ni les personnes qui peuvent invoquer cette d&eacute;fense, ni les situations dans lesquelles elle peut &ecirc;tre soulev&ecute;e, si on ne comprend pas sa raison d'&ecirc;tre et les finalit&eacute;s qu'elle vise. Dans cet article, l'auteur traite des deux principales th&eacute;ories de ce moyen de d&eacute;fense, &agrave; savoir: celle selon laquelle la d&eacute;fense cherche &agrave; &eacute;tablir des conditions &eacute;quitables ou justes entre les parties, et celle qui tourne autour de la nature de l'enrichissement dont le d&eacute;fendeur a b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute;. Selon l'auteur, ni l'une ni l'autre de ces explications ne sont id&eacute;ales. Entre les deux, cependant, l'analyse de la nature de l'enrichissement a l'avantage d'&ecirc;tre plus coh&eacute;rente et logique.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

Over the past century, courts throughout the common law world have gradually come to recognize restitution as an independent branch of private law, distinct from tort and contract and grounded in the concept of unjust enrichment. In many jurisdictions, recognition of the law of restitution has been followed by the adoption of what is generally referred to as a defence of &quot;change of position.&quot;  The defence permits recipients of benefits who would
otherwise be liable to claims in restitution to resist such claims in whole or in part, on the ground that events that have transpired since the benefit was received make it impossible for them to make full restitution without placing themselves in a worse position than they were in before the benefit was received. While it is most often invoked in cases involving mistaken payments of money, the defence can also arise in cases where the benefit is non-monetary, or in cases where the transfer of the benefit was induced by a third party. A change of position defence was set out in the 1937 American <cite>Restatement of Restitution</cite>,<sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup> while in Canada the Supreme Court recognized the defence's legitimacy in its 1975 decision in <cite>Rural Municipality of Storthoaks v. Mobil Oil Canada Ltd.</cite><sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup> More recently, in the 1991 case of <cite>Lipkin Gorman v. Karpnale Ltd.</cite><sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup> the English House of Lords followed suit and approved of the change of position defence, thereby bringing the law in England into line both with the weight of academic opinion<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup> and with the position taken by North American courts. In light of these developments, the defence now appears to be firmly established as an important component of the law of restitution in the common law world.<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup>
<p>
In the face of this apparent triumph of the change of position defence, it is somewhat surprising to discover that both its conceptual basis and its relation to the principles of restitution have yet to be fully analysed, either by the courts or by academic writers. Many commentators characterize the defence as flowing from considerations of equity. For example, Fridman and McLeod take the position that &quot;[o]ne situation which would appear to render it
inequitable for the defendant to be required to disgorge a benefit received from the plaintiff in the absence of any wrongdoing on the part of the defendant would be if he has changed his position for the worse as a result of the receipt in question.&quot;<sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup> The nature of the inequity that would be caused by
making the defendant provide full restitution, however, has remained largely unexplored. In <cite>Lipkin Gorman</cite>, Lord Goff declared:
<blockquote>
[I]t is right that we should ask ourselves: why do we feel that it would be unjust to allow restitution in cases such as these [where the defendant has changed his or her position]?  The answer must be that, where an innocent defendant's position is so changed that he will suffer an injustice if called upon to repay or to repay in full, the injustice of requiring him to repay outweighs the injustice of denying the plaintiff restitution.<sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup>
</blockquote>
As an explanation for the defence, this is unsatisfactory. It merely restates the underlying problem: if the basis of the
defence is the injustice of requiring repayment in these circumstances, why is it that the law considers the injustice full repayment would cause to the defendant to be greater than the injustice of denying the plaintiff full restitution?
<p>
It has been suggested<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup> as an alternative that the defence can best be
understood in an entirely different way: rather than seeing it as motivated by considerations of fairness between the parties, it is possible to envision the change of position defence as a corollary to the principles underlying the claim in restitution in which it arises. Resolving the question of the defence's basis is important not only in terms of our theoretical understanding of the law of restitution, but will also ultimately have significant consequences for the practical operation of the change of position defence, since the contours of the defence will inevitably be shaped to reflect courts' understandings of its purpose.
<p>
It is useful to consider the problem in terms of the definition of unjust enrichment set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in <cite>Pettkus v. Becker</cite>:<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup>
<blockquote>
[T]here are three requirements to be satisfied before an unjust enrichment can be said to exist---an enrichment, a
corresponding deprivation and absence of any juristic reason for the enrichment.<sup><a href="#ten">10</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Assuming that the second requirement---that the plaintiff has suffered a deprivation corresponding to the defendant's enrichment---is satisfied,<sup><a href="#eleven">11</a></sup> the defence of change of position has two potential bases. The first possibility is that a change of position by the defendant affects the first factor---the defendant's enrichment. That is, in some cases the defendant may have consumed or disposed of part of the original
enrichment in some fashion, so that by the time the plaintiff makes his or her claim the defendant's &quot;enrichment&quot; (as recognized by law) has wholly or partially dissipated. Under this line of reasoning, the principles of restitution might thus require only that the defendant remit to the plaintiff the lesser amount or
&quot;enrichment,&quot; however defined, that remains. A second possibility is that the defence of change of position has its origins in the third branch of the test---the requirement that there be an absence of juristic reason for the retention of the enrichment by the defendant. In other words, even if the defendant is thought to remain &quot;enriched&quot; there may be some countervailing juristic reason triggered by a change of position that entitles him or her to retain a portion of the enrichment. The juristic reason could, for instance, be based on considerations of fault, or implied representations by the plaintiff, or it might depend on some other set of factors.
<p>
In what follows, these two alternative bases for the change of position defence will be explored in more detail, and an attempt will be made to discover the preferable manner of approaching the problem. Before embarking on this course of action, however, it is necessary as a preliminary step to consider in more detail what is meant by a &quot;change of position.&quot;
<p>
<h3>&quot;Change of Position&quot; Defined</h3>

How is it that recipients of benefits can change their position in such a way that they would suffer if forced to disgorge them?  Suppose, for the sake of simplicity, that the benefit in question is a monetary payment mistakenly conferred. With the excess money in hand, the recipient may alter his or her spending patterns, and spend part or all of the mistaken payment on goods or services that he or she would not have purchased if the mistaken payment had
not been made. If called on to repay the money under a claim for restitution, it may be impossible for the recipient to return himself or herself to the position he or she occupied before the payment was made: purchased goods or services may have been irretrievably consumed, or they may have depreciated in value. Either way, forcing the recipient to return the full amount of the initial mistaken payment would leave the defendant worse off than he or she was at the outset, notwithstanding the fact that the recipient obtained some benefit from the goods or services consumed.
<p>
Although this point is to some extent self-evident, it is of such importance to the discussion of the change of position defence that it is worth examining in some detail.<sup><a href="#twelve">12</a></sup> Suppose that
prior to receiving a mistaken payment a defendant has a certain initial income. If there is a range of uses to which he or she can put that money (i.e., spending it on goods and services, saving it, or giving it away) he or she will distribute it among those alternatives by allotting specific amounts to each one. This will be done in such a way as to maximize the utility the defendant derives from the expenditures.<sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup>
<p>
Now, suppose that the defendant receives a mistaken payment, which elevates his or her income to a higher level. The defendant will plan to distribute this new amount among the alternatives in a new manner that maximizes utility at this new level.<sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup> What happens if, after having expended some or all of the money on this new distribution, the defendant is presented with a claim for restitution of the mistaken payment?  If the defendant can return his or her spending allocations to the initial distribution he or she will suffer no loss of utility by being made to return the money. This will be possible if no irretrievable expenditures that differ from
the first utility-maximizing distribution have yet been made. For instance, a defendant will suffer no loss if he or she has simply put the mistaken payment in the bank and not yet otherwise altered his or her spending patterns, or if he or she has spent some of the money buying a Rembrandt that he or she can resell at the price she paid for it. 
However, if some of the expenditures that differ from the original distribution are not recoverable, the defendant will, in general, experience an overall decrease in utility if he or she is made to return the entire mistaken payment:  it will be impossible for the defendant to return to the initial distribution, which by assumption was the distribution
that maximized utility at the initial level of income.<sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup> This will be the case even though the defendant may have gained <i>some</i> utility from the non-optimal expenditures.<sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup>
<p>
The defendant's loss of utility from misallocating his or her expenditures as a result of the mistake stems from the fact that people are generally not indifferent to alternative ways of allocating their resources. As a simple example, suppose X lives in a world where the only two commodities are bread and jam. If she has $10, suppose that she will choose to divide it evenly between bread and jam, on the assumption that this distribution of her resources maximizes her utility at this level of income. X derives a certain amount of utility from having $5 worth of bread
and $5 worth of jam, and gains even more utility if she can have the two together and indulge her fondness for jam sandwiches. Suppose, now, that she is the recipient of a mistaken payment of $2. She may now decide to distribute her new higher income by spending $6 each on bread and jam.<sup><a href="#seventeen">17</a></sup> If she
spends $6 on jam, and is then made to repay the $2 (before she has been able to buy bread) she will have only $4 remaining to spend on bread. The utility X can obtain will, as a result, be diminished---although she will gain some utility from having the extra dollar's worth of jam, this is worth less to her in and of itself than an additional dollar's worth of bread. Her overall utility is further decreased by the fact that she will now be able to make fewer jam sandwiches than could be made under her initial distribution of $10.
<p>
Receiving a mistaken payment can also cause a defendant to change his or her position in a related, but distinct manner. With the mistaken payment in hand, the recipient may choose to forgo income-earning opportunities in favour of leisure or some other activity. For example, after receiving a mistaken payment a defendant may decide not to volunteer for additional hours of overtime, choosing instead to go home and read a book. By being forced to return the money, the recipient can be affected in exactly the same way as if he or she had irretrievably spent an equivalent amount of the payment---from an economic point of view, the two situations are indistinguishable.
<p>
From this discussion, a few general observations can be extracted. To begin, it can be seen that in cases involving changes of position, whatever caused the benefit to be conferred---for instance, a mistake of fact or law or the actions of a third party---creates a net decrease in the well-being of the two parties. Although the defence
of change of position may or may not be conceived of as having as its <i>purpose</i> the allocation of this loss between the parties, it is useful to bear in mind that the <i>effect</i> of the defence, however understood, will be to distribute the loss between the parties in some way. As a second observation, it can be noted that there is nothing in the above analysis that suggests that only expenditures that deviate radically from the recipient's usual spending  patterns produce a change in position---when combined, a series of incremental changes in expenditure can have the same effect as a single extraordinary outlay.
<p>
There is, of course, an enormous practical difficulty that arises when applying this utility-based understanding of &quot;change of position&quot; to actual cases. Although the idea of a person's &quot;utility&quot; is a useful conceptual device, it is impossible to measure and difficult even to estimate. As a result, a court attempting to compute a change of position in terms of utility would be faced with the difficult problem of converting an abstract
detrimental change in utility to a concrete monetary figure. For example, if a defendant spent some portion of a mistaken payment on a trip to Europe, the above analysis suggests that the court should attempt to determine not only how much was spent on the trip, and whether the defendant would have gone on the trip in any case, but also the benefit he or she in fact received from the vacation. (Even if the person would not have gone were it not for the mistaken payment he or she will generally experience <i>some</i> benefit from it.)  This is, admittedly, a daunting prospect. Nevertheless, these practical difficulties do not invalidate the utility-based approach to the problem. Although the difficulties involved in analysing changes of position in terms of utility are indeed thorny, they are in essence evidentiary problems. When assessing damages in tort cases, courts are often confronted with problems that are as difficult or worse, which they manage to resolve, however imperfectly. It can be argued that the benefits that the utility-based approach provides by clarifying our understanding of the underlying problem of changes of position outweigh the practical complexities it creates. In any case, courts that consider themselves capable of estimating the value of a tort plaintiff's lost limb cannot legitimately shirk from attempting to estimate the utility of a trip to Europe.

<h3>Conceptual Bases for the Change of Position Defence</h3>

Having set out the issues and considered the meaning of the expression &quot;change of position,&quot; the central question can now be asked: what are the possible explanations underlying the change of position defence?  As noted earlier, two main alternative points of view exist. Some authors have suggested that the defence of change of position is based in some way on ideas of equity---that is, the defence is available in situations where it would be in some sense unjust to require the defendant to make full restitution. Alternatively, it has been argued that the defence is rooted in the concept of enrichment, and that its purpose is to restrict the defendant's obligation to the amount by which he or she was actually &quot;enriched.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup> In what follows,
each of these approaches to the problem will be discussed in turn, and an attempt will be made to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each position.
<p>
&quot;FAIRNESS- AND EQUITY-BASED&quot; EXPLANATIONS
<p>
A number of commentators have advanced explanations of the change of position defence based on the idea that when the recipient of a benefit changes his or her position as a result, it would be unfair to make him or her disgorge the entire benefit and absorb the ensuing loss. The origins of this position are often said to be found in the case of <cite>Moses v. McFerlane</cite>.<sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a></sup> In that case, in the course of discussing the nature of an action for money had and received, Lord Mansfield stated:
<blockquote>
[The defendant] can be liable no further than the money he has received; and against that, may go into every equitable defence, upon the general issue; he may claim every equitable allowance; etc.; in short, he may defend himself of every thing which shows that the plaintiff, <i>ex aequo et bono</i>, is not entitled to the whole of
his demand, or to any part of it.<sup><a href ="#twenty">20</a></sup>
</blockquote>
This statement has often been interpreted as a declaration that the right of restitution is &quot;essentially
equitable&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty1">21</a></sup> notwithstanding its common law origins, and that &quot;whenever the defendant can show that in equity and good conscience he ought not to repay, the obligation to repay should no longer exist, even if it did exist prior to the time when the defendant's equitable defence arose.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty2">22</a></sup>
<p>
The idea that changes of position can act as a defence by altering the balance of equities between the parties has been expressly adopted in several jurisdictions. In New Zealand, for instance, statute dictates that in cases of mistake restitution is to be denied in whole or in part
<blockquote>
if the person from whom the relief is sought receives the payment in good faith and has so altered his position in reliance on the validity of the payment that in the opinion of the Court, having regard to all possible implications in respect of other persons, it is inequitable to grant relief, or to grant relief in full, as the case may be.<sup><a href="#twenty3">23</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Many U.S. courts<sup><a href="#twenty4">24</a></sup> and commentators have taken a similar view. Probably the most notable American proponent of the &quot;equity-based&quot; defence is the <cite>Restatement of the Law of Restitution</cite>, which states:
<p>
&#167;142
<blockquote>
(1) The right of a person to restitution from another because of a benefit received is terminated or diminished if, after the receipt of the benefit, certain circumstances have so changed that it would be inequitable to require the other to make full restitution.<sup><a href="#twenty5">25</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Although it is debatable whether in this instance the <cite>Restatement</cite>'s position actually reflects a true consensus among U.S. courts as to the state of the law,<sup><a href="#twenty6">26</a></sup> there is no doubt that the authors' formulation of the change of position defence has been very influential in promoting the
&quot;balancing equities&quot; understanding of it.<sup><a href="#twenty7">27</a></sup>
<p>
If the change of position defence is conceptualized in terms of the balancing of equities between plaintiff and defendant several difficult questions arise. In attempting to strike an &quot;equitable&quot; balance, what considerations should a court view as relevant, and on what basis should the court weigh different factors that might
affect the &quot;equities&quot; of the situation?  To repeat Lord Goff's words, how is a court to decide when &quot;the injustice of requiring [the defendant] to repay outweighs the injustice of denying the plaintiff
restitution&quot;?<sup><a href="#twenty8">28</a></sup> Moreover, if it so happens that the  &quot;equities&quot; in a particular case are equal, what should the result be?
<p>
The <cite>Restatement</cite> addresses the first of these questions by introducing considerations of fault into the analysis:
<p>
&#167; 142
<blockquote>
(2) Change of circumstance may be a defence or a partial defence if the conduct of the recipient was not tortious and he was  no more at fault for his receipt, retention or dealing with the subject-matter than was the claimant.
<p>
(3) Change of circumstance is not a defence if--- 
<blockquote>
(a) the conduct of the recipient in obtaining, retaining, or dealing with the subject-matter was tortious, or 
<p>
 (b) the change occurred after the recipient had knowledge of the facts entitling the other to restitution and had an opportunity to make restitution.<sup><a href="#twenty9">29</a></sup>
</blockquote></blockquote>
From the point of view of &quot;balancing the equities,&quot; considering the relative fault of the two parties undoubtedly makes some sense. Since a decision to allow or not to allow the change of position defence to succeed will result in one or the other of the parties absorbing the loss that the mistake and resulting change of position has
created,<sup><a href="#thirty">30</a></sup> the question of which of the parties bears more of the responsibility
for creating the state of affairs that led to the loss does seem to have some intuitive connection with the &quot;fairness&quot; of allowing the defence to succeed. If, for example, it was the plaintiff's carelessness that caused a mistaken payment to be made, it seems unfair to make the defendant suffer as a result.<sup><a href="#thirty1">31</a></sup> There are, however, significant problems involved in translating this intuitive sense of fairness into a consistent legal rule.
<p>
<i>Problems with the Fault-Based Approach</i><br>
Introducing considerations of fault into the change of position defence creates several difficulties. To begin, it is
uncertain what degree of fault the authors of the <cite>Restatement</cite> believe is necessary to trigger the scrutiny of the court. Is some minimum level of fault required, and, if so, does the degree of fault needed differ from the negligence standard in tort law?  Moreover, does the fact that the <cite>Restatement</cite> differentiates between &quot;tortious&quot; conduct and mere &quot;fault&quot; imply that &quot;fault&quot; is intended to refer to some degree of blameworthiness less serious than negligence, or does the difference lie only in the fact that tort liability is dependent on the existence of a duty of care as well as an unreasonable standard of conduct?  The authorities on this point are ambiguous---the Comment on &#167; 142 by the authors of the <cite>Restatement</cite> speaks only of a &quot;fail[ure] to exercise care,&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty2">32</a></sup> while in his textbook Palmer states that &quot;[w]hen fault can fairly be attributed to either or both parties, relative fault is a fact to be taken into account&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty3">33</a></sup>
without identifying the degree of fault to which he is referring. As Cohen points out, American case law suggests that a much lower standard of fault than that found in tort law is generally applied:
<blockquote>
The law of torts furnishes a whole exegesis of the word &quot;negligence&quot;; and within the limits of that subject the word can be used with precision. Unfortunately, it bears no definable relation to the notion in quasi-contracts which is also termed negligence. It is different procedurally, for the decisions do not require a jury
to answer whether either party failed to observe reasonable care. It is different substantively, for the theory does not limit the court to significant inquiry into due care. The opinions do not make inquiry into the facts to determine whether given conduct meets <i>standards</i>. They content themselves with showing that the party ruled against made the mistake, and with asserting that he was the one who should have avoided it.<sup><a href="#thirty4">34</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The <cite>Restatement</cite> thus appears to indicate that courts are to determine the availability of the change of position defence by attempting to decide which of the parties was more to blame, without analysing their blameworthiness in relation to an objective standard of unreasonableness or, for that matter, to any other threshold of culpability. This approach is arguably rooted in distributive justice principles: courts are to determine which of the two parties is the least &quot;deserving&quot; within a limited moral framework defined by the parties' responsibility for the underlying mistake, and then allocate the loss arising out of the mistake accordingly. The
authors of the <cite>Restatement</cite> endorsed this loss allocation-based conception of &#167; 142 in the Comments accompanying the section, where they state:
<blockquote>
The rule stated in this Section is an application of the underlying principle of this Subject that restitution is granted
only where it is equitable so to do. Where events are such that a loss must be suffered by one of the parties, either with or without the ability to obtain reimbursement from a third person, justice does not require that the recipient should bear the loss, where he is guilty of no greater fault than that of the claimant.<sup><a href="#thirty5">35</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Viewed in isolation, there is not necessarily anything objectionable about such a loss allocation approach. Any decision to allow or disallow the change of position defence will indeed result in the loss caused by the mistake being assigned to one or the other of the two parties; consequently, a rule based on allocating the loss on the basis of some set of normative factors may be defensible. Nevertheless, taking this approach to be the basis of the change of
position defence leads to inconsistencies when the defence is considered in the context of the law of restitution and its underlying principles.
<p>
If the purpose of the change of position defence is to allocate the loss brought about by the mistake on the basis of the parties' responsibility for causing the mistake, the question can be asked: why should the analysis of relative fault be restricted to the plaintiff and the defendant?  The problem can be seen most clearly in cases where a third party plays a crucial role in the conferral of the benefit on the defendant. For example, in <cite>Jones v. Waring &amp; Gillow</cite>,<sup><a href="#thirty6">36</a></sup> both the plaintiff and the defendant were deceived by the &quot;rogue&quot; Bodenham. Bodenham tricked the plaintiff company into giving a cheque for  &#163;5000 to the defendant by leading it to believe that it was buying an interest in an automobile franchise business. In reality, neither the business nor the automobiles existed. The defendant was under the impression (also induced by Bodenham) that the payment it received was related to a debt owed to Bodenham, that he was transferring to it. After receiving the money, the defendant leased some expensive furniture to Bodenham on a hire-purchase contract. Eventually the truth of Bodenham's activities emerged and the defendant repossessed the furniture, but not before it had suffered irreparable harm.
<p>
If this case is to be analysed with a view to allocating the loss caused by the change of position on the most blameworthy party, there is an obvious candidate to bear the loss: Bodenham, the rogue. The restitutionary action in which the change of position defence arises, however, is a two-party process, involving only the defendant and
the plaintiff. This seems to suggest that if fault-based loss allocation is used to decide the issue of the defence considerations will be introduced to the problem that are alien to the underlying principles of the claim itself.<sup><a href="#thirty7">37</a></sup> If this is so, the resulting law is likely to be incoherent. 
<p>
In reply to this criticism it might be argued that the absence of Bodenham as a party to the proceedings is not fatal to the loss allocation model: the rogue, after all, is usually insolvent, and will thus escape shouldering the loss no matter how much he or she might deserve to bear it. As a result, even if all the parties were present, a court attempting to allocate the loss on the basis of fault would, presumably, be forced to identify the next most
blameworthy candidate and pin the loss on him or her. Moreover, if Bodenham had been able to pay, the plaintiff in this case would probably have sued him directly rather than involving the defendant. Therefore, it might be said the absence of Bodenham in this case is immaterial, since if he had been capable of bearing the loss he, and not the defendant, would be the subject of the action. Even if the theory behind the loss allocation approach suggests he should be present and accountable, it may be that no real harm will be done by his absence.
<p>
This counter-argument may be somewhat effective in situations like <cite>Jones</cite>, where the &quot;missing person&quot; is clearly the most blameworthy and is insolvent. It breaks down, however, when it is applied to situations where the third party is not such an obvious villain, or is not particularly villainous at all. As an example,
suppose that A ships goods to B by rail. The shipment never arrives, but B mistakenly pays A for the goods. Later, B sues A in restitution to recover the mistaken payments.<sup><a href="#thirty8">38</a></sup> The facts might reveal that the railway was, in fact, the most &quot;blameworthy&quot; of the three parties, even if all three were in some manner responsible for the mistake. Nonetheless, even if the railway were solvent the case might still arise as an action in restitution between buyer and seller, since the cause of the mistake might not be known before the action was brought. If the concept of placing the loss on the most blameworthy party is to be taken seriously as the central motivation of the defence, it evidently makes no sense to leave the railway out of the picture. The fact that the action in restitution does so suggests that a fundamental inconsistency might exist between the law of restitution and a defence of change of position that is conceptualized as a loss allocation device.
<p>
It is, moreover, no answer to this problem to say that whoever of the two parties is made to absorb the loss in the above situation will have a cause of action against the railway, so that the loss will eventually be shifted where it &quot;belongs.&quot;  The third party (in the example, the railway) may not have been enriched, so an action in
restitution against it might be impossible (for example, suppose the railway did not retain the goods, but instead delivered them to the wrong address). It is true that in some cases an action against the third party might lie in tort, but there is no guarantee that such an action would succeed. For instance, even if it is assumed that the &quot;blameworthy&quot; railway in the above example owed a duty of care to the losing party in the restitutionary action, it is quite possible that the railway, although more at fault than anyone else, was nonetheless not negligent in the more rigorous tort law sense (as noted earlier, the standard of fault applied in American change of position cases has been considerably lower than the standard of unreasonableness found in tort law). Consequently, the failure to include the railway in the initial loss allocation problem can have a real impact on where the loss finally falls. The incoherence that exists between the logic of the loss allocation model of the change
of position defence and the structure of the two-party action makes it impossible to achieve the result that the model suggests should be attained.
<p>
The interaction described above between the loss allocation model of the change of position defence and tort standards can be seen as an aspect of a larger conceptual problem that the existence of tort law poses for the loss allocation approach to the change of position defence. Like the change of position defence, however conceived,
one of the <i>effects</i> of a decision in tort law is the placing of a loss on one or the other of the parties in the case. Tort law does not, however, operate on the basis of loss allocation. Rather, it analyses problems in terms of the relationship between the parties, deciding cases on the question of whether, in the circumstances, the
defendant breached a duty owing to the plaintiff to take reasonable care to avoid creating the loss that ultimately ensued.<sup><a href="#thirty9">39</a></sup> Under this approach, it is perfectly possible (and self-consistent) for a plaintiff to bear a loss even if the defendant was &quot;more to blame&quot; for its occurrence, as long as the relative &quot;fault&quot; of the defendant falls short of the legal standard of unreasonableness. Without taking a position on the relative merits of tort law over other possible legal regimes, it can still be argued that it is inconsistent to apply different conceptions and standards of fault to two problems that, while not identical, are at least similar in their crude outlines. Both tort law and the change of position defence as conceptualized in the <cite>Restatement</cite> deal with problems that have the same general form: A does something that causes B to suffer a loss. Yet the loss allocation-based change of position defence suggests that the two problems should be treated quite differently, without explaining why this should be. Put another way, if fairness and justice dictate that the loss caused by a mistaken payment should fall on the party whose &quot;fault,&quot; no matter how slight, led to the mistake, why do these same considerations not require that the Long Island Railroad bear the loss suffered by Mrs. Palsgraf when the scales fell on her head?<sup><a href="#forty">40</a></sup> The accident was, after all, more the railroad's fault than hers, even if the railroad was not so much at fault as to have been negligent. If the
issue in each case is the fault of the parties, consistency would seem to require that a similar approach be taken to the question of fault in each instance, even though one case arises as a defence to a restitutionary action and the other as an action in tort.
<p>
In response, however, it might be argued that in spite of certain similarities to tort law the change of position defence is an altogether different creature. The change of position defence is, after all, merely a defence: it gives the defendant no positive right to bring an action, but merely allows him or her to resist partially a plaintiff's claim. This difference, it might be argued, is enough to make the analogy between the defence and tort law break down---it
need not be the case that the standards of fault necessary to raise a defence be the same as those required to establish an independent legal claim.
<p>
A similar position has been taken by Birks, in a somewhat different (although related) context. Birks has argued that a defendant should be able to defeat by estoppel a claim for restitution of money paid as a result of a mistake when the plaintiff owed a duty to the defendant to make accurate assessments of the amount the defendant was entitled to receive.<sup><a href="#forty1">41</a></sup> He states, however, that &quot;[t]his duty need bear no
relationship to the duty of care required to constitute tortious liability in negligence. We are not here concerned with tortious liability but with the conditions necessary to constitute a defence.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty2">42</a></sup>
<p>
On one level, this argument is hard to dispute---there is, indeed, no absolute necessity that all defences in law apply the same standards as related forms of positive action, nor an absolute requirement that defences and forms of action be consistent with one another. Nonetheless, although not required, consistency and coherence between various areas of the law are goals worth striving for. The fact that the loss allocation-based explanation of the change of position defence creates inconsistency and contradiction is sufficient reason to doubt the adequacy of the model, particularly when there exist alternative explanations (as discussed below) in which these problems do not arise to the same extent. Moreover, even if symmetry between claims and defences is not an absolute requirement, it is a feature of many areas of the law. For example, in tort cases based on negligence where the defendant can argue as a defence that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent, essentially the same standard is applied in judging the plaintiff's conduct as is used in judging the defendant's.<sup><a href="#forty3">43</a></sup> Consequently, the fact that the &quot;equity&quot;-based change of position defence relies on a new standard of fault may, indeed, be grounds for rethinking the rationale that suggests the need for the new standard in the first place.
<p>
<i>Situations Where &quot;Fault&quot; Is Absent</i><br>
Aside from the question of the merits of introducing the issue of fault into the analysis of the change of position defence, a further problem arises under the &quot;equity&quot;-based approach. In many cases where the change of position defence is likely to be invoked it will be impossible to ascribe any meaningful degree of fault to either the plaintiff or the defendant.<sup><a href="#forty4">44</a></sup> The general consensus in American law (including the <cite>Restatement</cite>) appears to be that in this situation the defendant should nonetheless be allowed to invoke his or her change of position as a defence. It is far from clear, however, that this rule can be
justified on the basis of the &quot;balance of equities&quot; between the parties. Cohen has argued that in cases of this sort it is impossible to make a determination based on &quot;moral&quot; considerations. As he writes:
<blockquote>
Is it true that a genuine moral judgment is possible in what the commentators treat as the usual case of change of position?  It seems to this writer at least that the problem as they posit it really furnishes no moral alternatives with which to weight a decision. To consider a concrete case. <i>P</i> pays to <i>D</i> money which, through the fault of neither, both believe is owing. In fact, <i>X</i> is the debtor, but this is not discovered until the Statute of Limitations has run against <i>D's</i> remedy against <i>X</i>. Can there be any moral, as distinguished from ethical, <i>ought</i> in this case?  To require <i>D</i> to repay the money paid to him under mistake is to ignore the fact that he irrevocably changed his position in reliance on the mistaken payment. Yet to deny <i>P</i> a recovery is to change his position irrevocably, if only by virtue of the denial, and to make indefeasible in <i>D</i>
a title which he did not originally have. The claims of each party to sympathetic attention are so obvious that it is nothing short of shocking that the question should be approached as if the dictates of good conscience could furnish a satisfactory answer. That the moral alternatives are equally attractive, that either horn of the dilemma pricks the good conscience with identical sharpness, would seem clear. Though regrets for the abandoned alternative may be deeper, the choice does not differ materially from that which makes the rule of the road.<sup><a href="#forty5">45</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Indeed, proponents of the defence who support it on &quot;moral&quot; grounds have generally been unable to articulate anything more than an imprecise intuition that when neither party is at fault the defendant should be protected. Even the economics-oriented authors. Beatson and Bishop admit that in supporting the rule they &quot;rest [their] choice frankly on grounds of moral intuition&quot;<sup><a href="#forty6">46</a></sup> that they cannot articulate in concrete terms. It may be the case that most people do, in fact, share this intuitive response, and believe that the defendant should be protected from the consequences of the mistake. It is
debatable, however, whether such a vague intuitive belief can provide a sound basis for a legal rule.
<p>
Although it may be impossible to articulate a concrete &quot;moral&quot; reason for favouring the defendant, a related argument can be made, based on the claim that the change of position defence is in essence an equitable device that should be governed by general equitable principles. In particular, it might be argued that the equitable
maxim &quot;he who seeks equity must do equity&quot; applies to prevent a plaintiff from fully enforcing his or her right to full restitution if to do so would unduly harm the defendant. On this view, the conscience of a court of equity prevents it from acting as the agent by which an inequity is committed, even if the result of inaction is to make the plaintiff suffer an equivalent loss that is not necessarily morally justified. As Lord Greene M.R. stated in
<cite>Re Diplock</cite>:<sup><a href="#forty7">47</a></sup>
<blockquote>
[E]quity intervenes not to do what might be thought to be absolute justice to a claimant but to prevent a defendant from acting in an unconscionable manner ... . If this limitation on the power of equity results in giving to a plaintiff less than what on some general idea of fairness he might be considered entitled to, that cannot be helped.<sup><a href="#forty8">48</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The idea that such equitable considerations should be relevant in restitution is often traced to the comments of Lord
Mansfield in <cite>Moses v. McFerlane</cite> quoted earlier.<sup><a href="#forty9">49</a></sup>
<p>
This argument, however, has several drawbacks. From an historical point of view, the law of restitution developed from the common law action of <i>indebitatus assumpsit</i> rather than from equity. In any case, there is disagreement over whether the change of position defence was traditionally recognized by equity itself.<sup><a href="#fifty">50</a></sup> As a result, any argument promoting an equitable conception of the change of position defence must go beyond a discussion of traditional equitable maxims and provide compelling reasons explaining why the approach <i>should</i> be adopted in the restitutionary context. This may not be an impossible task---it could be argued, for instance, that courts should never as a rule act in a way that harms &quot;morally innocent&quot; parties. This approach, however, fails to explain what courts should do in cases where the
&quot;equities&quot; are unequal. In such a case, it seems inevitable that considerations of fault will have to be brought back into the analysis. The result is a rather cumbersome two-part explanation for the defence---if some sort of moral fault can be established, loss allocation principles will dictate where the burden of the loss falls, but if no moral distinction can be drawn between the parties a decision not to allow full restitution will be based on essentially unrelated policy grounds concerning the proper role of the court. Faced with this unwieldy explanation for the defence, one has to wonder whether it is not possible to find a more persuasive rationale for its existence.
<p>
To summarize, it appears that attempts to justify the change of position defence on &quot;equitable&quot; grounds stumble on a number of hurdles. Attempting to &quot;balance the equities&quot; between the parties seems to lead inevitably to the introduction of considerations of relative fault into the analysis---considerations that do not always
fit in well with the overall two-party structure of the restitutionary action, and that create problems of consistency with other areas of law (in particular, tort law). Moreover, when fault cannot be ascertained it becomes necessary to look elsewhere for a reason to prefer one party over the other. On the whole, the &quot;equitable&quot; conception of the change of position defence is unsatisfactory. Fortunately, an alternative approach to the problem can be found, which avoids at least some of the problems raised by the equitable model. The alternative approach, as noted earlier, focuses on the <i>enrichment</i> of the defendant rather than on the justice or injustice of its retention.
<p>
&quot;ENRICHMENT-BASED&quot; EXPLANATIONS
<p>
As the Supreme Court of Canada has stated, the modern law of restitution is based on the concept of unjust
enrichment.<sup><a href="#fifty1">51</a></sup> There is, however, a degree of uncertainty involved in the term
&quot;enrichment&quot;: how is enrichment to be measured, and at what time is the measurement to be made?  It has been suggested that the definition of enrichment lies at the heart of the defence of change of position. As Klippert puts it:
<blockquote>
A logical defence to an unjust enrichment claim would be to plead that the defendant has not been enriched. His enrichment may have been only temporary, so that by the time he has notice of the claim he is no longer in a position to disgorge the benefit. The aim of the unjust enrichment action is to require benefits to be disgorged; if there is no longer a benefit to be disgorged, the court should not go further and require the impoverishment of an innocent defendant to compensate the plaintiff.<sup><a href="#fifty2">52</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Birks has analysed the problem in a similar way, although the details of his approach differ slightly. As he conceives it, claims in restitution necessitate a four-step inquiry:
<blockquote><ol>
<li>Was the defendant enriched?
<li>If so, was it at the expense of the plaintiff?
<li>If so, was the enrichment actionably &quot;unjust,&quot; in the sense that it was in the circumstances
reversible as a matter of positive law?
<li>Is there any defence or other countervailing factor requiring restitution nonetheless to be denied
in whole or part?<sup><a href="#fifty3">53</a></sup>
</ol></blockquote>
Although Birks sees the issue of change of position as falling under the fourth stage of the inquiry rather than the
first, he nonetheless argues that the conceptual basis for the defence is the effect of a change of position on the defendant's enrichment. After noting that there are three possible types of expenditure that might lead to a change of position---unrequested expenditures, expenditures made at the behest of the plaintiff, and expenditures prompted by a request of a third party<sup><a href="#fifty4">54</a></sup> ---Birks goes on to assert that:
<blockquote>
[C]hange of position ... is an effective defence because it bears directly on the measure of the defendant's enrichment in that there is a direct causal nexus between the plus received and the minus laid out ... [I]t follows that our three cases can all be treated as one, for the same idea will explain each: they can all be seen as enrichment-based changes of position in which the causal nexus between plus and minus requires that the enrichment represented by the plus be adjusted to allow for the minus.<sup><a href="#fifty5">55</a></sup>
</blockquote>
In spite of the differences in their approaches, both Birks' and Klippert's formulations of the change of position
defence rest on the same underlying conception: namely, the idea that a defendant who detrimentally changes his or her position is to that extent no longer enriched, and should only be liable in restitution for the amount of enrichment that has been retained.
<p>
The &quot;enrichment-based&quot; explanation has a number of distinct advantages over the &quot;fairness-based&quot; approach. By relating the availability of the defence to the principles underlying the initial
restitutionary claim, the need to import into the analysis external considerations of blameworthiness or fault can be avoided, so the problems and inconsistencies such importation creates do not arise. Under the enrichment-based view, the change of position defence is simply another aspect of the concept of unjust enrichment itself. Plaintiffs in restitution cannot, after all, claim compensation from defendants for <i>any</i> loss they might have suffered; rather, there must be a connection between the loss and the defendant's gain---if there is no corresponding enrichment, restitution grants no remedy. The enrichment-based change of position defence simply extends this logic one step further, declaring that the amount of restitution is to be limited to the extent of the defendant's true
enrichment.
<p>
It might be argued, however, that the symmetry of the restitutionary action and the enrichment-based understanding of the change of position defence is achieved only by submerging the problems encountered in the  &quot;equitable&quot; approach in the definition of &quot;enrichment.&quot;  The suggested connection between a defendant's change of position and his or her enrichment can be made only if the concept of enrichment is understood in a particular way---that is, if a person's enrichment from the receipt of a benefit is thought of as
relating to the utility he or she derives from it, rather than to the benefit's face value. Such a conceptualization is by no means inevitable. If the decision to adopt such an understanding of enrichment was purely result-driven---that is, intended solely to facilitate the existence of the change of position defence, which one favoured on other grounds (such as an imprecise &quot;moral intuition&quot; that &quot;innocent&quot; defendants should be protected)---the apparent coherence of the enrichment-based approach with the rest of the law of restitution would indeed be illusory: the dilemmas plaguing the &quot;equitable&quot; approach would simply have been swept under the
carpet, and no real conceptual progress would have been made.<sup><a href="#fifty6">56</a></sup>
<p>
The choice of a definition of enrichment that allows for a change of position defence, however, can arguably be justified on grounds other than the fact that it might protect defendants. Restitutionary cases have a certain structure, which in some important respects reflects the structure of actions in tort. In both situations a plaintiff who has suffered a loss seeks compensation from a defendant. The plaintiff is not, however, entitled to compensation from anyone he or she chooses---there must be a legally recognized connection between the plaintiff and a particular defendant that entitles the plaintiff to compensation from <i>that</i> defendant.<sup><a href="#fifty7">57</a></sup> In tort law, the required connection is that the plaintiff's loss be caused by the defendant, and that the defendant be at fault in respect of the injury that has materialized; similarly, in restitution the connection comes into being only if the defendant is enriched at the plaintiff's expense, in the absence of a juristic reason that would entitle him or her to retain the enrichment. In both regimes, once the conditions for liability have been established, the focus shifts to the extent of compensation that is required. In tort law, although a defendant is liable only for damages of a type that are foreseeable, within this limitation a tortfeasor &quot;takes his or her victims as he or she finds them&quot;: damages are calculated (at least in principle) on the basis of the loss of utility of the passive victim---the particular plaintiff in <i>that</i> case. For example, in personal injury cases a court assessing damages takes into account the particular situation of the plaintiff---his or her earning potential, for instance---and computes the quantum of damages accordingly.<sup><a href="#fifty8">58</a></sup> Whatever the defendant might have gained from his or her tortious conduct is irrelevant. Similarly, it can be argued, in restitution cases the quantum of compensation---the extent of the defendant's enrichment---should also be determined in terms of changes in utility. In restitution,<sup><a href="#fifty9">59</a></sup> however, unlike tort, it is the <i>defendant</i> rather than the <i>plaintiff</i> who is the passive recipient of a change in utility (which happens to be positive rather than negative). As a result, it might be suggested, symmetry with tort law requires that the quantum of restitution also be calculated in terms of the change in utility (here, the increase) experienced by the passive party (here, the defendant).
<p>
Even if this argument in support of the enrichment-based approach to the change of position defence is accepted, a number of vexing questions still remain. If the defence operates by recognizing that in certain circumstances the extent of defendants' enrichment can be affected by events that make it impossible for them to return to their initial pattern of saving and consumption, a question arises: are there any limits on the type of intervening events that can
trigger the defence?  As an illustration, consider two defendants, A and B, who each mistakenly receive payments of $2,000. Suppose that both of them, motivated by their new-found wealth, alter their spending patterns by making substantial purchases that they would not have made but for the mistaken payment: A spends her money on a trip to Fiji, while B buys a new car, which is subsequently destroyed in an unfortunate accident. Assume that at the time restitutionary claims are made against them that both defendants would suffer if made to return the entire $2,000. Should the fact that B's inability to return to his initial position is at least in part a result of an intervening external event---the accident---affect the availability of the change of position defence in his case?
<p>
As Dawson has pointed out, in German law almost any intervening event that produces a loss can be enough to allow an &quot;innocent&quot; defendant to invoke the change of position defence. As he describes it:
<blockquote>
For [German judges] there is one short and simple rule: [defendants] cannot be required to surrender more than their
surviving net gain, or, as it is often expressed, they must under no circumstances be required to &quot;reach into their own pockets.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty">60</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The scope of the defence is limited, however, by the fact that it is available only to &quot;innocent&quot; defendants---that is, to defendants who did not know that they were not entitled to keep the benefit they had received. Once a defendant has obtained actual knowledge, his or her liability to provide restitution becomes
fixed, and is not reduced even if he or she does not act in bad faith---for example, if the benefit is lost through some unavoidable accident before the defendant has the opportunity to grant restitution.
<p>
Dawson is highly critical of the German approach, which he characterizes as showing &quot;a basic though well-meaning confusion of thought.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty1">61</a></sup> In his view, the German
defence &quot;rest[s] on the ... basic misconception, that the existence or the extent of liability to restore unjust enrichment should depend on the degree to which the person enriched was aware of his own moral fault.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty2">62</a></sup> Dawson objects to this conception on the grounds that in most
restitutionary claims both the plaintiff and defendant were active participants in the transaction that led to the  conferral of the benefit, so there is no reason to favour the defendant.<sup><a href="#sixty3">63</a></sup>
<p>
Although it is impossible in the limited space available here to respond fully to the detailed and extensive arguments put forward by Dawson, a few points can be made. While Dawson's hostility toward the German model appears to be based to a large extent on what he sees as a mistaken belief that equity dictates that &quot;innocent&quot; defendants be protected, his own criticisms are vulnerable to attack on the opposite grounds: he is arguably too quick to assume that defendants who are unaware that they are not entitled to retain a benefit are guilty of &quot;moral fault&quot; for not immediately recognizing this lack of entitlement. As Dawson recognizes, the duty to make restitution does not depend on active &quot;wrongdoing&quot; by the defendant; his use of the term &quot;moral fault&quot; in this context appears to mean simply the defendant's duty to remit to the plaintiff
an enrichment that it would be unjust to retain. It does not necessarily follow from the principles of restitution, however, that this duty attaches at the time the benefit is conferred (as Dawson appears to assume) rather than at the time the defendant becomes <i>aware</i> that he or she is not entitled to retain it. Dawson's view that it attaches at the earlier time is arguably based as much on an unfounded assumption about the moral position of defendants as
is the German position he criticizes---if the German rule can be attacked for making the unwarranted assumption that all defendants are &quot;innocent,&quot; Dawson can be criticized for assuming that they are all &quot;guilty&quot; instead.
<p>
That said, however, the German approach may still go too far. Although the concept of enrichment can be interpreted to allow defendants to reduce the amount payable to take into account changes in their spending patterns, it is less clear that the definition of enrichment can easily encompass the scope of protection offered to defendants
under the German rule. In effect, the German rule requires plaintiffs to insure &quot;innocent&quot; defendants against all manner of loss that occurs before the defendants learn of their duty to return a benefit. This may not be defensible---as Dawson points out, the defendant may not be so &quot;morally innocent&quot; that equity requires
the plaintiff to bear all the risk that accompanies a mistaken conferral of benefit. In the absence of a proprietary remedy, defendants are not generally required to disgorge additional gains that accrued from their temporary possession of the benefit, so it may not be unfair to make them shoulder the responsibility for certain types of risk as
well.
<p>
Moreover, although almost everyone would agree that defendants who wilfully change their position after obtaining a benefit to which they know they are not entitled should not be able to adjust the amount owing, if the knowledge of the defendant is the sole determinant of whether or not a loss can be deducted (as it is in German law) unusual results can sometimes ensue. Consider, for example, the following situation: two people are in a restaurant, and
one mistakenly places a $10 bill in the other person's coat pocket, having mistaken her friend's coat for her own. After leaving the restaurant the second person finds the money in his pocket, thinks it is <i>his</i> own, and puts it in his wallet. On the way home, he is mugged and his wallet stolen. Now consider the same set of events, with one variation: when the recipient finds the money, he realizes it belongs to his friend, and places it in his wallet with the
intention of returning it to her the next day. It is hard to see why in these two cases knowledge of the mistake should make any difference in the way the law treats the loss---common sense would seem to dictate that either both hypothetical recipients should be entitled to a defence or neither of them should be, but that a defence should not be available to one and not the other.
<p>
Several authors<sup><a href="#sixty4">64</a></sup> have addressed these problems by suggesting that only certain types of changes to a defendant's utility can be used to raise the change of position defence. As Birks conceives it, there must be a &quot;causal nexus&quot; between the initial conferral of a benefit and the subsequent
change of position that would lead to the defendant suffering a loss if full restitution is ordered. In other words, the change of position must in some sense have resulted from the conferral of the benefit. As an example, Birks considers a contractor who has received a cash payment in advance for building a house. The money is subsequently destroyed in a fire. Birks asks:
<blockquote>
Has the builder suffered an enrichment-related change of position?  It is very difficult to say that he has, because,
contrary perhaps to first appearances, there is no causal nexus between the plus and the minus. It is irrelevant that among his losses were the very notes received. The situation would be exactly the same if they alone had survived. He has simply suffered a fortuitous supervening loss, much as though, the day after receiving the payment, a
company in which he had previously invested had collapsed, or he had crashed his car and broken his legs, or his Picasso had been stolen. Supervening poverty does not necessarily erase enrichment. This is not a genuine paradox, but merely a semantic trick. The condition of having been enriched is undone by causally related outlay, not by
the causal onset of poverty. Job, for example, if he received any mistaken payments or other unjust enrichment, remained thereby enriched even after the Devil had stripped him of all his earthly wealth.<sup><a href="#sixty5">65</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The notion that a causal link must exist between the receipt of the benefit and the defendant's change of position before the change can give rise to a defence is in many ways an appealing one. It does, however, present problems of its own. As is the case in other areas of law, the problem of causation in change of position cases can be an enormously difficult one to resolve. In terms of simple &quot;but for&quot; causation, for instance, a distinction actually can be drawn in the above example between the builder's loss of the cash and the other types of loss that Birks mentions: unlike the other examples, the money would not have been destroyed had it not been for the payment---the payment was responsible, as it were, for the money being in the wrong place at the wrong time. This type of crude &quot;but for&quot; causation is, presumably, not what Birks has in mind in imposing his causation requirement.<sup><a href="#sixty6">66</a></sup> Arriving at a more sophisticated definition of causation is, however, no simple task. It is some consolation that the problem is probably no more difficult than the corresponding issues of causation that arise in tort and criminal law, for example, which courts have been able to deal with even if they have not been able to resolve them conclusively.
<p>
Birks has also raised the possibility that the enrichment-based explanation for the change of position defence may not be able to cover all the situations where such a defence might be appropriate. He points out that in some cases defendants might be unable to establish &quot;a causally determined minus to set against the plus&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty7">67</a></sup> yet would suffer hardship if forced to return the full amount of the benefit. As an
example, he presents the case of a poor schoolteacher who receives a mistaken overpayment in his salary. By the time his employer discovers the error and demands the money back, the defendant's financial condition has worsened and he would experience hardship if made to return the money, although he can point to no particular
expenditure made in reliance on the extra income. Birks then asks the following questions: &quot;[I]s there to be a hardship related defence of change of position distinct from an enrichment-related defence?  If yes, what kind of hardship, and what other facts will it require?&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty8">68</a></sup>
<p>
It is debatable, however, whether Birks' hypothetical example truly presents a new problem that cannot be dealt with under the framework of the enrichment-based change of position defence. The hardship that Birks pictures his schoolteacher suffering is not, after all, simply the realization that his windfall has to be returned, as would be the case if the defendant had simply put the mistaken payment in the bank. Rather, Birks posits a situation where
the money has been spent, but where the defendant is unable to identify a specific expenditure that would not otherwise have been made.<sup><a href="#sixty9">69</a></sup> In order for the example to make sense, however, it must be the case that the mistaken payment has not simply gone towards an expenditure that
would otherwise have been made---if it had, then by definition the defendant would have an equivalent surplus remaining (which, it is assumed, he does not). Instead, the defendant must have increased his overall spending patterns to include his new-found income, although he may have done so in a way that is difficult to identify:
for example, he may have purchased slightly higher-quality groceries.
<p>
What Birks fails to recognize is that the defendant's difficulty in identifying a specific &quot;causally determined minus&quot; that can be deducted from the amount owing is in essence an <i>evidentiary</i> problem rather than a <i>conceptual</i> problem. As discussed earlier, the series of incremental changes in expenditure in this case can cause just as significant a change in the defendant's position as he or she would have experienced if the money had been spent on a single major act of consumption, such as a trip to an exotic locale---the only difference is that the first type of change of position may be more difficult for a defendant to prove. Consequently, a court would not appear to require recourse to any new conceptual mechanisms in order to allow the change of position to be
invoked in Birks' hypothetical example. Rather, what would be required is a more flexible approach to the evidentiary issue. This is not an insurmountable difficulty---in the proper case (including Birks' example), it might be possible for a court to infer from the surrounding facts that the defendant has, in fact, incrementally changed his or her position. 
<p>
Although on its facts the outcome in <cite>Storthoaks</cite><sup><a href="#seventy">70</a></sup> may not be inconsistent with this approach, the Court can be criticized for the emphasis placed in its decision on &quot;special financial commitments&quot; as the hallmark of changes of position, since this suggests that changes of position only arise when extraordinarily large shifts in spending habits occur. As the above discussion indicates, this is hard to justify as a matter of principle. Rather, it can be argued that the Court should recognize that a series of incremental deviations from pre-benefit patterns of expenditure can also produce a change of position, and that the
significance of &quot;extraordinary&quot; expenditures are simply that they make changes of position easier to prove as matters of fact, not that they are essential as matters of law.
<p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

The enrichment-based explanation of the change of position defence provides a more coherent and logical foundation for the defence than can be found under the fairness-based approach. A number of outstanding issues require further analysis, however, before the enrichment-based explanation will be entirely satisfactory. In particular, if the change of position defence is to be limited by a requirement that there be a &quot;causal nexus&quot; between a defendant's initial enrichment and his or her later change of position, the precise nature of the causal relationship needs further explanation. Nonetheless, the improvements in conceptual understanding that are gained by adopting the enrichment-based framework outweigh the drawbacks of the approach, especially when the more serious inadequacies inherent in the alternative ways of envisioning the defence are taken into account.
<p>
The <cite>Storthoaks</cite> decision was undoubtedly an important first step in the development of the defence of change of position in Canadian law. As a foundation for future development of the change of position defence, however, <cite>Storthoaks</cite> leaves something to be desired---although the Court recognized the existence of the defence, it did little to explain its underlying conceptual basis. This omission must be corrected if the defence is to be able to develop in a consistent and understandable manner.
<p>
The law of restitution is still in its infancy, at least in comparison with its older, more well-established private law
siblings, contract and tort. Consequently, it is neither surprising nor alarming that many important issues still await conclusive treatment by Canadian courts---in time, these issues will arise to be decided, and the blank areas on the map of the law of restitution will be filled in. In the case of the change of position defence, the courts will be faced with a difficult choice in deciding on a conceptual framework. It is to be hoped that they will approach the problem in a way that helps rather than hinders the goal of a clearly articulated and principled development of the law. Once drawn, lines on the map of restitution will be difficult to erase or change. It would be better if the courts get them right the first time.

<li><a name="two">(1975), 55 D.L.R. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.)</a> [hereinafter <cite>Storthoaks</cite>]. The Municipality had granted Mobil certain oil and gas leases. Under the terms of the leases, Mobil was required to pay the Municipality royalties based on the production of oil and gas from the leased property. Mobil was entitled to
terminate any of the leases at any time. In 1964, Mobil decided to terminate two of the leases, and notified the Municipality of its intention. As a result of an unexplained error by Mobil's accounting department, however, the company continued to pay royalties relating to these properties for four more years. Eventually the mistake was
discovered, and Mobil sued to recover the mistaken payments. Martland J., writing for the Court, recognized the existence of a change of position defence, stating (at 13):
<blockquote>
In my opinion it should be open to the Municipality to seek to avoid the obligation to repay the moneys it received if it can be established that it had materially changed its circumstances as a result of the receipt of the money.
</blockquote>
On the facts of the case, however, he held that since there was no evidence that the Municipality had undertaken any special projects or special financial commitments as a result of the payments it had not established that it had  changed its position.

[hereinafter <cite>Lipkin Gorman</cite> cited to All E.R.]. Cass was a partner in Lipkin Gorman, a firm of solicitors. Over several months he embezzled more than &#163;300,000 from the firm. He was a compulsive gambler and lost much of the stolen money in the defendant Karpnale's casino. The
casino had no idea that Cass was not entitled to the money. Once the theft was discovered, Lipkin Gorman sued Karpnale, demanding return of the money. As a result of s.18 of the <cite>Gaming Act</cite> 1845 the gambling contracts between Cass and Karpnale were void, so Karpnale was prevented from arguing that it had given good consideration in exchange for the money. The question that then arose was whether Karpnale was entitled to plead change of position---that is, whether it could deduct from the money it had received from Cass the money it
had paid out to him on those occasions when he had won his bets. The House of Lords held that it could, thereby recognizing for the first time the existence of a change of position defence in English law.

<p>
<li><a name="thirteen">In mathematical terms,</a> the problem can be described as follows: the defendant has an initial income <i>I<sub>o</sub></i> which can be allotted between N choices by allotting amounts x<sub>1</sub> ...x<sub>N</sub> to each choice. The defendant distributes his or her income in
a way that maximizes his or her utility function,<p>
<center><img src="formula1.gif" alt="Mathematical formula"></center>

<p>
It should be noted that in order not to reduce the generality of this formulation it is necessary to express the
utility gained from buying the <i>n</i>th item as a function of the amounts allotted to each of the N expenditures. This reflects the fact that some expenditures are useful only if they are accompanied by corresponding spending on other items---for example, the utility one derives from owning a car will vary depending on whether one can
afford to buy gasoline. (Of course, in practice not every term will exhibit an actual dependence on every variable.)
<p>
<li><a name="fourteen">That is,</a> if the new income is designated <i>I</i><sub>1</sub>, the defendant will distribute this higher income among the N alternatives in a new way, <i>y</i><sub>1</sub> ... <i>y</i><sub>N</sub>, that produces a new utility <i>u</i>(<i>y</i><sub>1</sub> ... <i>y</i><sub>N</sub>).
<p>
<li><a name="fifteen">It is,</a> of course, possible that there was more than one initial distribution which could achieve this maximum utility, so it is conceivable that the defendant might be able to return to a new spending distribution that was also utility-maximizing.

The <cite>Nunavut Agreement</cite> is the first comprehensive land claims agreement in Canada to extend aboriginal self-government over a vast region. It is not localized self-government, the jurisdiction of which is comparable to a municipality. Instead, Nunavut is unique for a land claim in that it guarantees political rights to self-government. However, self-government takes on a new meaning in Nunavut. It is a government system that is enshrined in democratic principles such as popular representation. Moreover, it becomes a recognized governing
region in Canada with a distinct cultural identity. &quot;Public government&quot; in Nunavut thus provides effective self-government, due to the huge Inuit majority of the population in the Eastern Arctic. Any omissions in the <cite>Agreement</cite> can be covered by an Inuit territorial government with broad administrative powers. Inuit concerns become entrenched in the government agenda due to the majority status of the Inuit in Nunavut. However, public government does not liberate the Inuit from the hardships experienced in the communities. It is at the community level where significant change occurs. Therefore, newly acquired political rights will not resolve
problems, but only facilitate their solutions. Thus, while the future of the Eastern Arctic relies on factors that are yet to be determined, one constant will be the elevation of Inuit interests onto the government agenda and the preservation of Inuit culture, which can never be eroded in a land where no other group is a threat to become the majority.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

One thing that emerged from the failure of the Charlottetown Accord was a realization among native Canadians that
constitutional entrenchment of an aboriginal right to self-government was still illusory. Moreover, the dialogue was not likely to be reopened for some time. As many First Nations returned to the bargaining table to pursue their interests independently of one another, there was a common perception that land claims agreements, sometimes referred to as &quot;modern treaties,&quot;<sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup> could better satisfy current aboriginal needs and settle outstanding grievances, as well as establish First Nations self-government. 
<p>
One such &quot;treaty&quot; is the <cite>Nunavut Land Claims Agreement</cite>.<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup> It is a product of over 20 years of exhaustive consultation among Inuit representatives and the federal and territorial governments. During that time, the Inuit did not perceive constitutional entrenchment of
general aboriginal rights as a viable alternative to a land claims settlement. Land claims are a useful vehicle for the Inuit to engage in a new relationship with the government. Although controversy surrounds any extinguishment of rights and title, which these agreements require, the impact of surrendering them may be overstated in the context of the Eastern Arctic. The <cite>Agreement</cite> contains a specific framework that governs many aspects of life in the Eastern Arctic including wildlife management, land and water use, and resource development. It creates a number of tribunals and agencies to enforce its provisions and guarantees Inuit representation on them. This is of great importance because it ensures Inuit participation in overseeing the development of the Eastern Arctic.
<p>
The most controversial component of the <cite>Agreement</cite> is the clause that extinguishes Inuit title and rights to traditional lands and water in exchange for financial compensation. The boundaries of the land claim encompass the traditional lands of the Inuit, but the Inuit have given up title to---and many corresponding
rights in---those lands. In addition, the extinguishment clause precludes the Inuit from taking any legal action against the government. The loss of their rights as titleholder to the land and the right to assert any other legal claims against the government may have serious ramifications when the payments from the government which are stipulated in the <cite>Agreement</cite> terminate.
<p>
However, to minimize the potential difficulties of the extinguishment clause, the <cite>Agreement</cite> delegates political control of Nunavut to the Inuit. Inuit government will ultimately extend beyond the local level, thus creating a wide scope of jurisdiction. This will be effected by a severance from the Northwest Territories in 1999 which will introduce Nunavut as Canada's third territory. Nunavut will have its own legislature, whose representatives will be elected from a population of which the Inuit are clearly the majority. This suggests that Inuit concerns will dominate the government agenda, mitigating the losses resulting from the extinguishment clause.
<p>
The purpose of this article is to explore the relationship of the <cite>Agreement</cite> to Inuit political development. It begins with an historical overview to provide a better understanding of the <cite>Agreement</cite>. It then examines the concept of self-government, the definition of which is mired in ambiguity, and a revision of this concept---known as public government---on which the <cite>Agreement</cite>
is based. It will be demonstrated that due to the realities of the Eastern Arctic, public government may be a more appropriate mechanism to satisfy Inuit aspirations. This is followed by a comparative analysis with other comprehensive land claims, and the problems encountered in them. The <cite>Agreement</cite>'s response to those problems will be highlighted to distinguish Nunavut from other land claims. 
<p>
This article also addresses whether the <cite>Agreement</cite> will facilitate solutions in areas that raise the most pressing issues for the Eastern Arctic---economic development, resource and land-water management, and community participation. A promising future may be highly dependent on variables the <cite>Agreement</cite> cannot control. The article concludes by examining the issue of community justice, the means by which Inuit aspirations will be fully met. Although the <cite>Agreement</cite> is silent on this issue, a future political accord
creating the Nunavut territory is expected to encourage local dispute resolution. What takes place at the local level will demonstrate how Nunavut will work. Any notion of self-government or self-realization for the Inuit ultimately relies not on the present wording in the <cite>Agreement</cite>, but on participation at the community level as well
as higher regional levels. The obstacles inherent in attaining Inuit objectives are abundant. However, the possession of government authority, complemented by constituents who are actively involved in their own government, creates the potential to overcome these obstacles.
<p>
<h3>The Inuit, Land Claims, and Aboriginal Rights</h3>
<p>
It is important to distinguish the Inuit experience from that of other First Nations. The Inuit are less disenchanted with the government than are other native peoples, which is attributable to their more recent exposure to non-native North Americans. Historically distinct, Inuit culture has been less undermined by the impact of Canadian expansion. Because the Inuit live in a profoundly different environment, their response to government initiatives is unique. Furthermore, the concept of aboriginal rights takes on a different meaning in the Eastern Arctic. Debate over native issues, such as the controversy surrounding land claims, must be viewed through the Inuit perspective.
<p>
The choice of resolving these issues through a land claims settlement, where First Nations would receive financial compensation, land ownership, participation in government, and administrative responsibility in exchange for the extinguishment of their aboriginal rights to traditional lands and waters, has touched off controversy.<sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup> A loss of title to the land is equivalent to a loss of identity. The land plays a strong role in
native lifestyles; to remove title to it can weaken native culture.
<p>
Some argue that an individual agreement contributes little to the advancement of aboriginal constitutional
goals.<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup> On this account, aspirations of sovereignty and self-determination
cannot be met by any delegation of authority. This undermines any attempt by aboriginal peoples to &quot;live the way they wish.&quot;<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup> In fact, the reverse may ensue; aboriginal peoples may eventually suffer from assimilation and, as a result, cultural erosion.<sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup> The attraction of land claims with promises of greater accessibility to government institutions and increased participation in decision making can be construed as a vehicle for acculturation that operates by convincing aboriginal peoples of the merits of the Canadian political process.
<p>
The extent of what an extinguishment clause destroys is a source of confusion for First Nations.<sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup> The clause in the <cite>Agreement</cite> does not preclude the Inuit from enjoying all
constitutional rights or government programs.<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup> The courts are continually expanding the parameters of aboriginal rights,<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup> which might counterbalance what was given up in the <cite>Agreement</cite> since the rights surrendered under it relate primarily to the land.
Additionally, because land claim agreements are recognized in s. 35 of the <cite>Constitution</cite>,<sup><a href="#ten">10</a></sup> entitlement to benefits flowing from aboriginal rights as well as government programs is constitutionally guaranteed.
<p>
Land claims agreements provide a concise and concrete outline of aboriginal rights and responsibilities for a specific area. This replaces the more general concept of &quot;aboriginal rights and title&quot; which is indisputably vague. The delineated transfer of economic and especially political power induces the &quot;enhancement of aboriginal rights, not the extinguishment.&quot;<sup><a href="#eleven">11</a></sup> The federal government's description of its land claims policy illustrates this point:
<blockquote>
The stated purpose of the federal government's comprehensive land claims policy ... is to provide certainty and clarity of rights to ownership and use of land and resources in those areas of Canada where Aboriginal title has not been dealt with by treaty or superseded by law... . Land claims negotiations should look to the future and should provide a means whereby Aboriginal groups and the federal government can pursue shared objectives such as
self-government and economic development.<sup><a href="#twelve">12</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Other observers have reaffirmed the comprehensive nature of the land claims agreements, which satisfy many objectives such as cultural protection and economic development of the area.<sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup> The <cite>Agreement</cite> removes the Inuit from the constitutional discourse and alternatively presents them with a definitive framework for administering their lands. 
<p>
A general right to self-government may be incompatible with land claims agreements. The agreements laboriously set out the parties' rights, duties and responsibilities and specify how the administration will operate and how royalties and compensation funds will be handled. A blanket right to self-government over a settlement region is difficult to reconcile with the detailed terms of land claims agreements. It raises questions of interpretation more than it provides answers to the existing needs of the communities and the people's relationship with the land. Including this right in any agreement creates an ambiguity that can hinder progress for the land claims area. 
<p>
In addition, land claims agreements have some advantages over negotiating within a rights discourse. &quot;Aboriginal rights&quot; is a loose, generalized term that lacks any contextual meaning. Peter Ittunuar, a chief negotiator for the <cite>Agreement</cite>, comments:
<blockquote>
If there is one word that describes the legal status of the concept of aboriginal rights, that word is &quot;ambiguous.&quot;  During the last ten years almost every legal initiative taken to clarify the
concept has resulted in further ambiguities being created.<sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup>
</blockquote>
 &quot;Aboriginal rights&quot; is an abstract, Euro-Canadian legal term used to define a relationship with the land. By contrast, the <cite>Agreement</cite> establishes administrative and regulatory mechanisms to monitor use
of the land and its resources while addressing particular Inuit issues. Furthermore, rights must be confirmed in the judicial arena. Establishing Inuit rights in court requires patience to withstand the protracted litigation process. Moreover, litigation requires a tremendous financial commitment to cover necessary court and legal expenses. Consequently, this diverts attention and resources from the more immediate problems in the communities. The rights discourse, which proposes to ensure equality among all Canadians, is far removed from the daily interaction between individuals in northern communities. 
<p>
Rights are abstract legal concepts embedded in principles of individualism and personal liberty. Thus, the pursuit of aboriginal rights assumes that each aboriginal person is equal. As a result, all aboriginal peoples are deemed to be living in the same conditions and sharing the same ambitions. This perception of a unified native perspective has pervaded the constitutional dialogue, but it fails to appreciate regional and local aspirations.<sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup> The needs of the Inuit may not correlate with the ambitions of aboriginal (Indian)
peoples in southern Canada. Purich comments:
<blockquote>
While the Inuit sought to attain many of the same goals as their Aboriginal counterparts, the Inuit came to the negotiating table with a very different perspective and history than the Indian and M&eacute;tis people. No reserves were ever created for the Inuit, as there had been for the Indian people. Nor had promises been made to
the Inuit, as there had been to the Indian people by way of treaty, or to the M&eacute;tis by the way of the Manitoba Act and Dominion Lands Act.<sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Inuit exposure to Canadian society has been a relatively recent phenomenon. Interest in northern development<sup><a href="#seventeen">17</a></sup> emerged during an era in which treaties were no
longer pursued.<sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup> Canada's relationship with the Inuit has developed in a different context in which land claims have supplanted the treaties of the past. 
<p>
The presence of the Canadian government has been less intrusive on the Inuit lifestyle compared with Indians in southern Canada or even the Dene or M&eacute;tis, who have been, directly or indirectly, the subject of various federal and provincial legislation.<sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a></sup> Furthermore, the reserve system, which did not apply to the Dene and M&eacute;tis, has contributed to the erosion of traditional aboriginal culture. The relations between government and the Inuit may not be as acrimonious as those of other aboriginal peoples who are embittered by numerous treaty abrogations. A less painful history has engendered more trust in the government by the Inuit, which was apparent during the negotiation of the <cite>Agreement</cite>.<sup><a href="#twenty">20</a></sup> 
<p>
Contributing to the differences between the Inuit and other First Nations are their intermittent conflicts with each other. Historically, there have been incidents of hostility and disgruntlement between Indians and the Inuit; these still exist, albeit in a more subtle form.<sup><a href="#twenty1">21</a></sup> Nunavut proposals have distanced the Inuit, a people with inherent social and cultural differences, from other First Nations in the Territories. Their political transformation is evident through Inuit organizations such as the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, Nunavut Tungavik and Pauktuutit, as well as active participation at Inuit Circumpolar Conferences. Enshrining aboriginal rights such as self-government in the <cite>Constitution</cite> will not necessarily recognize these separate interests. It also fails to embrace the characteristics unique to the Arctic and its inhabitants. The aboriginal peoples' agenda is consolidated under the rubric of rights, guaranteed and equal. Its universality can lead to assimilation of the Inuit with other First Nations. Homogenizing an aboriginal identity in Euro-Canadian legal terms can induce cultural disintegration.
<p>
The <cite>Agreement</cite> appreciates rather than neglects the Inuit experience. Comprehensive land claims help foster a relationship with traditional lands. They can more easily accommodate the needs of a harmonious population, dispersed over a large region with similar ecological and climatic conditions. Inuit interests are amply reflected in an accord that they negotiated without the involvement of other First Nations. The promise of obtaining government powers over the Nunavut territory was incorporated into the <cite>Agreement</cite>. Although self-government was on the agenda during recent constitutional discussions, a redefinition that is amenable to the political environment of the Eastern Arctic could be formulated only by the Inuit.
<p>  
<h3>Self-Government vs. Public Government</h3>
<p>
Land claims settlements, generally encompassing a vast geographical area and diverse communities, usually do not contain explicit references to the right of self-government as it is currently known. Self-government is an essential aspect of First Nations' claims which include native sovereignty over their people. Many First Nations do not divorce land from self-government issues because they are interconnected.<sup><a href="#twenty2">22</a></sup> However, the ambiguity of the term &quot;self-government&quot; can exhaust land claims negotiators who attempt to define it. Opportunities to discuss a self-government arrangement occur
infrequently, but the countless questions about its operation can lead to the stagnation of the land claims dialogue. It becomes an attempt to achieve too much in a land claim and inevitably complicates the process. This problem was addressed during discussions of the <cite>Agreement</cite> in order to narrow the issues at the negotiating table.<sup><a href="#twenty3">23</a></sup> It was imperative to do so for the Eastern Arctic claim because of the size of the territory and the extensive administrative regime required to govern it.
<p>
The <cite>Agreement</cite>, however, does not abandon the issue of self-government but rather reworks it to fit current models of government in Canada based on democratic representation. Public government is legislative government that is democratic, based on regional and/or popular representation. What is unique in this situation is that the electorate is predominantly Inuit, which ensures that Inuit interests are accounted for in government decisions. Because of their majority status in the Eastern Arctic, public government is a viable option for the Inuit; it may not succeed in other parts of Canada. Inuit ambitions for self-government contrast with what other First Nations seek. Purich elaborates on the Inuit objective:
<blockquote>
Of course, there are some differences in what the Inuit seek in self-government and what other Aboriginal people seek. For the most part, the Inuit, be they in northern Quebec or the eastern Arctic, have looked to a public government to satisfy their aspirations for self-government. And in fact, Inuit spokesmen have often argued that what they are seeking is not self-government, but public government in which they will play a role appropriate to their numbers. The fact that the Inuit have chosen a public form of government rather than one which would serve Inuit people exclusively may well make it more palatable to non-Aboriginal communities.<sup><a href="#twenty4">24</a></sup>
</blockquote>
For the Inuit, a people who are about to be a majority in a new Territory where they will be strongly represented in the bureaucracy, this form of self-government is more justified. Public government does not deviate from self-government principles as much as it contributes towards the establishment of a working relationship with government involving active Inuit participation. Instead of mono-ethnic self-government, public government transplants the Euro-Canadian system of popular representation into a jurisdiction where most of the citizenry are Inuit. The interests and rights of the majority are preserved by government. Protection of the Inuit is furnished not out of a need for special treatment due to historical disadvantage, but because they form a majority of the population.
<p>
Inuit concerns are more likely to be addressed, and Inuit aspirations to flourish, when the solution is acceptable to the government. Public government does not mandate self-government for the Inuit. It is only a logical extension of democratic principles to another jurisdiction of Canada. Consequently, this renders Nunavut a more acceptable model of self-government for the federal authorities because it &quot;gives Indians internal self-determination
without compromising fundamental traditional values.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty5">25</a></sup> The <cite>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite>,<sup><a href="#twenty6">26</a></sup> as part of the <cite>Constitution</cite>, is the supreme law of the land,<sup><a href="#twenty7">27</a></sup> and consequently all public laws are subject to its provisions. By incorporating the right to self-government into the
<cite>Agreement</cite>, a constitutional &quot;exemption&quot; from the <cite>Charter</cite> would be granted under s. 25 for Nunavut laws.<sup><a href="#twenty8">28</a></sup>
<p>
Although the <cite>Agreement</cite> declares the formation of a Nunavut legislature, its status is severed from other provisions.<sup><a href="#twenty9">29</a></sup> Therefore, the right to public government under the <cite>Agreement</cite> is not a constitutional right beyond the ambit of the <cite>Charter</cite>. Any such constitutional exemption would be unacceptable to the provinces, which must legislate according to <cite>Charter</cite> provisions. Thus, it is government preference to exclude the right to self-government from land claims agreements in order to maintain the universal applicability of the <cite>Charter</cite>.<sup><a href="#thirty">30</a></sup> This position is manifest in the <cite>Agreement</cite> where all Inuit are guaranteed <cite>Charter</cite> rights.<sup><a href="#thirty1">31</a></sup> Public government does not grant immunity
from the reach of the <cite>Charter</cite>, but rather mirrors other governing authorities in the Canadian family.
<p>
Demands of sovereignty and nationhood, as legitimate as they might be, accomplish little except to isolate First Nations from the government position. In effect, Nunavut represents an adherence to the principles of sovereignty and self-determination, &quot;tempered by a measure of realism.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty2">32</a></sup> The Inuit Tapirisat of Canada states:
<blockquote>
[T]he Inuit have always been an immensely practical people, since the dawn of time. We recognize the necessity of an agreement which will codify and respect our rights in the land. We recognize that this process will be painful, but necessary if we wish to reach a workable understanding with the rest of Canada.<sup><a href="#thirty3">33</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The idea of public government may be easier for the Inuit and other aboriginal peoples in the north to accept due to their majority status in the overall population.<sup><a href="#thirty4">34</a></sup> Inuit representation in government already influences Territorial policy. Consequently, Northwest Territories legislators, who operate by consensus, consider the impact of every law on aboriginal rights. As a result, self-government is not perceived as
a method of escape from government control, as it may be by other aboriginal peoples.<sup><a href="#thirty5">35</a></sup> With the creation of a new territory in the Eastern Arctic and its own legislature,<sup><a href="#thirty6">36</a></sup> the interests of the largest sector of the voting population in Nunavut will be protected in a public government system that democratizes rather than decrees self-government. 
<p>
The &quot;home rule&quot; system in Greenland, in place since 1979, with a 4-to-1 ratio of Inuit to Europeans, is similar to what Nunavut will be. The Inuit in Greenland run their government much like a Canadian province. Greenlandic issues are largely administered by a legislative assembly which is elected by residents of the island.
Home rule resembles the public government model, with the Inuit asserting a strong role in government affairs. Originally, this was criticized as not effecting a complete withdrawal from the Danish authorities. However, Greenlanders have asserted <i>de facto</i> control over social, cultural, and environmental matters without any
express powers or rights of self-government.<sup><a href="#thirty7">37</a></sup> This suggests that in Nunavut any Inuit concern, existing or future, that the <cite>Agreement</cite> fails to acknowledge can be remedied by the Nunavut administration. The legislative process can indirectly create a self-governing territory
for the Inuit. Consequently, the <cite>Agreement</cite> essentially guarantees much of what those who advocate native self-government seek to achieve.<sup><a href="#thirty8">38</a></sup>
<p>
Before undertaking a thorough analysis of the <cite>Agreement</cite>, it is useful to refer to previous land claims settlements in Canada. Past experience has caused general discontent with comprehensive claims; thus, comparisons will help to determine how the <cite>Agreement</cite> differs from its predecessors. The negotiators
of the <cite>Agreement</cite> took heed of the problems in previous land claims agreements that occurred both before and after their signing. The major problems with the <cite>James Bay Northern Quebec Agreement</cite> (<cite>JBNQA</cite>) revolve around its inadequate implementation. The <cite>Inuvialuit Agreement</cite>, although successful in its economic ventures and environmental management, falls short on political reform. The ultimate question becomes whether the errors of the past will be repeated. 
<p>
<h3>Other Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements in Canada</h3>

I.  THE JAMES BAY NORTHERN QUEBEC AGREEMENT
<p>
The circumstances that existed before the signing of the <cite>JBNQA</cite> are helpful in understanding the dissatisfaction felt by the Cree, Naskapi and Inuit in the region. Because of its own anticipated energy needs and an opportunity to acquire lucrative electricity contracts with some states in the northeastern United States, in 1991 Quebec decided to develop a massive hydro-electric operation. The project would produce dire environmental consequences for the region through the damming and diversion of major rivers and the resulting flooding of thousands of acres of land. This gravely threatened aboriginal livelihood in the area. After offers to negotiate by the Cree and the Inuit were ignored by the Quebec government, the parties pursued the matter in the courts. They
obtained a court injunction to suspend the dam construction until native claims over aboriginal title were settled.<sup><a href="#thirty9">39</a></sup> Quebec, the federal government, corporate business entities, and the aboriginal peoples affected then ushered in a hastily negotiated agreement, under a set deadline. 
<p>
The <cite>JBNQA</cite> provided for compensation, native responsibilities in environmental and wildlife management, economic and social development of the area, and hunting rights. Despite the comprehensiveness of the <cite>JBNQA</cite>, it lacked any legal obligation to clarify its provisions or regulate its operation.
Correspondingly, there were no provisions for sanctions for failure to implement the <cite>JBNQA</cite> or for any policing body to enforce it.<sup><a href="#forty">40</a></sup> The application of the <cite>JBNQA</cite> was also impeded by limited funds based on low financial estimates for the <cite>JBNQA</cite>'s implementation and administration. This shortsightedness may have been a consequence of hammering out an agreement under the pressure of a fixed deadline. The <cite>JBNQA</cite> did not arise from a spirit of cooperation, since the Quebec government felt compelled to consent in order to foreclose any further court action, which had already diverted too much of the province's attention and financial resources.<sup><a href="#forty1">41</a></sup> The lack of goodwill may have influenced the province's reluctance to transfer the stipulated funding for requisite agencies, programmes, and services. As a result, implementation was slow and ineffective, and made the government
parties look dishonourable.
<p>
Compounding the implementation problems were the inherent ambiguities in the <cite>JBNQA</cite>. Wording and terminology are crucial to land claims settlements, but they are inevitably subject to a number of interpretations. The length of the <cite>JBNQA</cite> exacerbates that problem. It has fuelled constant disagreement between the parties as to the extent of their obligations. It has also invited attempts by the Quebec government to overlook its
commitments under the <cite>JBNQA</cite>. In response, natives in Northern Quebec have turned to the courts. 
<p>
The Quebec government has introduced proposals aimed to bypass environmental assessment requirements in the <cite>JBNQA</cite><sup><a href="#forty2">42</a></sup> for the Eastmain Dam. Its construction could wreak further devastation on the land settlement's environment.<sup><a href="#forty3">43</a></sup> Massive flooding of the area from hydro-electric development has significantly disrupted the ecological balance. This has had a severe impact on aboriginal subsistence activities. The alteration of caribou migration patterns in the area has made hunting more difficult.<sup><a href="#forty4">44</a></sup> The weakness of the wording in the <cite>JBNQA</cite>, as judicially interpreted in <cite>Eastmain</cite>, has impaired the ability of the Cree, Inuit and Naskapi to control any interference with their lands.<sup><a href="#forty5">45</a></sup> The rights of natives to participate in managing their lands were not sufficiently stated, by legal standards, in the <cite>JBNQA</cite>. 
<p>
The Inuit have experienced particular frustration from Quebec's failure to fulfil its obligations under the <cite>JBNQA</cite>. The <cite>JBNQA</cite> did address Inuit aspirations of local autonomy;<sup><a href="#forty6">46</a></sup> Inuit communities in northern Quebec have jurisdiction over standard municipal functions including zoning, policing, public health, pollution, and taxation. However, since 1981, the Quebec government has been more active in the delivery of municipal services. Its involvement has been intrusive and has fostered
resentment among the Inuit.<sup><a href="#forty7">47</a></sup> There has been inadequate funding from the province for municipal and health services, which has necessitated the diversion of capital from <cite>JBNQA</cite> compensation payments.<sup><a href="#forty8">48</a></sup> With insufficient resources, living conditions in some communities have worsened.<sup><a href="#forty9">49</a></sup>
<p>
As control at the community level has been undermined, the Inuit have also suffered from a pronounced language and cultural barrier in Quebec. The integration of Inuit values and ideals is problematic in a province that vigorously upholds the linguistic and cultural integrity of French Canada. Essentially the Inuit in Quebec are a &quot;minority within a minority&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty">50</a></sup> due to a greater familiarity with English customs, language and lifestyle. Achieving a working relationship is difficult when one party cannot comprehend the interests of the other because of divergent backgrounds. 
<p>
Aside from the implementation problems, &quot;many provisions of the agreement are working well.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty1">51</a></sup> In comparison with the little attention that has been paid previously to native peoples in northern Quebec, their financial plight has improved; many trained Inuit and Cree are employed in bureaucratic positions and the various hunting and trapping regimes have been successful.<sup><a href="#fifty2">52</a></sup> The most significant gain was the realization of s. 9 of <cite>JBNQA</cite>, which stipulated an obligation to institute self-government for the Cree. This arrangement was proclaimed the <cite>Cree-Naskapi Act</cite>,<sup><a href="#fifty3">53</a></sup> and is more extensive than any form of municipal government. The Cree and Naskapi have authority to regulate natural resources, culture, health, and wildlife protection, which differentiates them from a prototype municipality.<sup><a href="#fifty4">54</a></sup> As a provision in the <cite>JBNQA</cite>, the <cite>Act</cite> has been afforded constitutional status under s. 35 of the <cite>Constitution</cite>.<sup><a href="#fifty5">55</a></sup>
<p>
The Nunavut <cite>Agreement</cite> differs markedly from the <cite>JBNQA</cite> in a number of ways and attempts to address some of the problems that have occurred under the <cite>JBNQA</cite>. First, unlike the <cite>Cree-Naskapi Act</cite>, the Nunavut <cite>Agreement</cite> repudiates any connection between political authority and aboriginal rights.<sup><a href="#fifty6">56</a></sup> However, the <cite>Agreement</cite> does not provide for localized self-government.<sup><a href="#fifty7">57</a></sup> A government power based on a municipal model within a province can never give the Inuit the jurisdiction they need to govern themselves effectively. Nunavut will have an administration that encompasses a much larger territory and wider powers. The
creation of a new political entity lessens the importance of entrenching the Nunavut government into the <cite>Constitution</cite>. A broad jurisdiction enhances the perception of Nunavut as another order of government in Canada.
<p>
Second, the <cite>Agreement</cite> establishes a detailed framework for the Nunavut administration which will protect Inuit political power. The <cite>Agreement</cite> can thus be distinguished from the <cite>JBNQA</cite>, which suffered from numerous implementation problems. The <cite>JBNQA</cite> preceded the <cite>Constitution</cite>, thus depriving it of any overriding constitutional authority to challenge provincial unwillingness to meet <cite>JBNQA</cite> conditions. However, a land claims agreement's provisions are now responsibilities that are enshrined in s. 25 of the <cite>Constitution</cite>. Today, &quot;the lack of implementation would be tantamount to a violation of a constitutional right.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty8">58</a></sup>
 <p>
Third, the <cite>Agreement</cite> reflects the way in which the negotiating process and the parties differ from those in the <cite>JBNQA</cite>. To avoid the interpretation problems of the <cite>JBNQA</cite>, there are constitutional safeguards for First Nations, to ensure favourable interpretations of agreements or treaties with the
government in light of uncertain provisions.<sup><a href="#fifty9">59</a></sup> However, the Nunavut <cite>Agreement</cite> contains a waiver of this preference by eliminating &quot;any presumption that doubtful expressions in the <cite>Agreement</cite> be resolved in favour of Government or Inuit.&quot;<sup><a href="sixty">60</a></sup> This provides for neutrality in intepreting a comprehensive land claims agreement since the parties are deemed to be of equal bargaining power.<sup><a href="#sixty1">61</a></sup> Unlike the  <cite>JBNQA</cite>, the <cite>Agreement</cite> is a product of thorough consultations and dialogue between the
parties over a long period. Thus it is more likely to include carefully drafted terms that are fully understood by all parties. 
<p>
In addition, regardless of any constitutional protection, the Tungavik Federation of Nunavut (TFN), along with the territorial and federal governments, has responded to the complications experienced in the <cite>JBNQA</cite> by drafting an Implementation Program.<sup><a href="#sixty2">62</a></sup> This is an arrangement ancillary to the <cite>Agreement</cite> which establishes guidelines, defines terms, and provides funding and budget estimates. These guidelines are prepared for an Implementation Panel. They are not binding but merely provisional.<sup><a href="#sixty3">63</a></sup> The {\itl Contract} acts on the guarantee of &quot;timely and effective implementation of the <cite>Agreement</cite> with active Inuit participation,&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty4">64</a></sup> which can preclude any initial acts of bad faith. The Implementation Panel will ensure the execution of the initial <cite>Agreement</cite> and the smooth transition involved in transferring the Territorial administration of the Eastern Arctic to Nunavut authorities. Complications from the transition will be addressed by
the Panel, which facilitates a speedy remedy to problems that may emerge.<sup><a href= "#sixty5">65</a></sup> Unlike the <cite>JBNQA</cite>, the <cite>Agreement</cite> transition period stretches over six years, which will enable all parties to recognize and surmount preliminary hurdles.
<p>
II.  INUVIALUIT FINAL AGREEMENT: WESTERN ARCTIC LAND CLAIM
<p>
The Inuvialuit Settlement Region in the Western Arctic was originally included in the Inuit proposal to the government.<sup><a href="#sixty6">66</a></sup> However, due to disagreements between Inuit leaders, two negotiating parties emerged: the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada (ITC) for the east and the Committee of People's
Entitlement (COPE). The <cite>Inuvialuit Agreement</cite> contains provisions that transfer title and rights (including mineral surface rights) to Inuvialuit lands, guarantee exclusive harvesting rights, and promise strong involvement in environmental management and financial compensation. 
<p>
Astute management of the compensation has brought economic development to the Inuvialuit region. This has delivered financial rewards to the area and stimulated new business ventures. The Inuvialuit Regional Corporation (IRC) oversees Inuvialuit lands and subsidiary corporations which include an airline company (Aklak Air), a petroleum corporation with extraction operations in Alberta (Inuvialuit Petroleum Corporation), urban real estate, a shipping company, and the largest construction company in the western Arctic.<sup><a href="#sixty7">67</a></sup> It is due to this regional prosperity and a pivotal input to the land management process that the <cite>Inuvialuit Agreement</cite> has been praised as a success for native peoples that may never be duplicated.
<p>
Noticeably missing from the <cite>Inuvialuit Agreement</cite> are clauses addressing issues of taxation, absolute subsurface land rights, health and education which were present in a proposal tendered six years previously.<sup><a href="#sixty8">68</a></sup> While this might be attributed to reasons of political expediency,<sup><a href="#sixty9">69</a></sup> a more significant omission from the <cite>Inuvialuit Agreement</cite> is the proposal for public government known as the <cite>Western Arctic Regional Municipality (WARM)</cite>. Although the Inuvialuit are promised equal treatment when governmental restructuring is implemented in the Northwest Territories,<sup><a href="#seventy">70</a></sup> the uncertainty of what this treatment implies, or when restructuring will occur, leaves the Inuvialuit well short of having any substantial guarantee of effective self-government.<sup><a href="#seventy1">71</a></sup>
<p>
Following the signing of the Western Arctic Claim, COPE leaders expressed satisfaction with what the settlement
offered.<sup><a href="#seventy2">72</a></sup> The popular sentiment at the time downplayed the impact of the
extinguishment clause:
<blockquote>
Research conducted within the Inuvialuit Settlement Region indicates that the Inuvialuit do not feel any aboriginal rights have been extinguished. Rather, all the claims of land, self-government and cultural continuity are felt by COPE to be included in the Western Arctic Claim. Extinguishment, to COPE (Committee of People's Entitlement), means there will be no further land claims by the Inuvialuit. It extinguishes no other rights.<sup><a href="#seventy3">73</a></sup>
</blockquote>
However, there was no referendum indicating full Inuvialuit approval, which has divided Inuvialuit leaders from community members. This has become more pronounced during the recession in the early 1990s as the economic benefits from the land claims have been greatly reduced. The lack of political power has fuelled the debate between local and central administrators.<sup><a href="#seventy4">74</a></sup>
<p>
In  contrast, Nunavut officials were careful to avoid any criticism that a centralized negotiation process had overlooked the needs of the communities, by obtaining popular support for the <cite>Agreement</cite> through a plebiscite. The administration of affairs over a vast area will require support from the different regions in Nunavut.
Enthusiasm in the communities is necessary for any effective change. A legislative body, in which local leaders can express the concerns of the community, will continue the interaction between community and Nunavut territorial leaders. Public government can assist in mediating the types of conflicts that may surface in Nunavut.
<p>
The <cite>Inuvialuit Agreement</cite>, like its predecessor the <cite>JBNQA</cite>, may become the true measuring stick for future claims. Although both are highly useful for reference, any comparison with the <cite>Agreement</cite> cannot acknowledge Inuit history and development, the local political climate, and the particular needs in the Eastern Arctic. The Nunavut <cite>Agreement</cite> is an accomplishment independent of other arrangements. It is the conclusion of more than twenty years of work, which in itself separates it from other
agreements created over a much shorter period of time. Thus it is important to examine the particular terms of the Nunavut <cite>Agreement</cite> and how it can fulfil Inuit objectives. 
<p>
<h3>The Nunavut Agreement</h3>

I.  GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS
<p>
The Nunavut <cite>Agreement</cite> covers more than 2 million square kilometres and affects approximately 17,000 Inuit living in the area.<sup><a href="#seventy5">75</a></sup> Inuit land ownership encompasses approximately 352,000 square kilometres of land, with 36,300 of it including mineral rights (which have not been included in other settlements).<sup><a href="#seventy6">76</a></sup> Inuit lands are granted to the Inuit in fee simple<sup><a href="#seventy7">77</a></sup> which is alienable only in fee simple to the Territorial or Federal governments or to Nunavut municipalities.<sup><a href="#seventy8">78</a></sup> This is a restriction on the proprietary right of free alienation of land, but Canadian policy has always prohibited the disposition of native lands to private landholders under the <cite>Royal Proclamation</cite>.<sup><a href="#seventy9">79</a></sup> The Inuit are still able to lease or license the land or grant any other interest less than fee simple. Inuit Owned Lands, where aboriginal title is entrenched, are not under the jurisdiction of the <cite>Indian Act</cite>,<sup><a href="#eighty">80</a></sup> since they are not lands reserved for Indians for purposes of the <cite>BNA Act</cite>.<sup><a href="#eighty1">81</a></sup>
<p>
The <cite>Agreement</cite> is not as generous as the Inuvialuit claim, but it is still ample, providing about 15.5 square kilometres per person.<sup><a href="#eighty2">82</a></sup> Every Inuk, an individual Inuit person, has the right to remove up to 50 cubic yards of carving stone per year from Crown lands.<sup><a href="#eighty3">83</a></sup> Inuit also have an exclusive right to use any water that runs through their lands.<sup><a href="#eighty4">84</a></sup> The <cite>Agreement</cite> provides for free and unrestricted Inuit harvesting rights on the remaining Crown lands, park lands, water, and marine areas<sup><a href="#eighty5">85</a></sup> in Nunavut.<sup><a href="#eighty6">86</a></sup> Any developer who encroaches on Inuit subsistence hunting rights is liable for any loss sustained. Harvesting rights are subject to laws of general application for public safety purposes, quotas set by the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB), conservation purposes, Bilateral Parks and Conservation Areas Agreements, or land use activity authorized under the <cite>Agreement</cite>.<sup><a href="#eighty7">87</a></sup>
<p>
Any claims contesting the infringement of harvesting rights are heard before an Arbitration Board,<sup><a href="#eighty8">88</a></sup> which substitutes for the Canadian courts. The Board is composed of members agreed upon by the Government of Canada, the Territorial Government, and the Designated Inuit Organization (DIO).<sup><a href="#eighty9">89</a></sup> Therefore, Inuit hunting, trapping and fishing rights will be a
constant consideration and are precluded from analysis under Canadian law.<sup><a href="#ninety">90</a></sup> This process moves questions of Inuit cultural integrity into an arena where their
interests are understood. The Arbitration Board is an invaluable mechanism that avoids the waste of limited financial resources and the delays of the court system---hardships often incurred when pursuing aboriginal rights cases.
<p>
II.  THE DISTINGUISHING FEATURE
<p>
Although the Nunavut <cite>Agreement</cite> resembles many other land claims agreements in Canada, the requirement to create a new territory sets it apart. This was a strong incentive for the Inuit, who perceived the <cite>Agreement</cite> as opening an avenue for political empowerment and sovereignty that is absent in other settlements. The <cite>Agreement</cite> is final and protected under s. 35 of the <cite>Constitution</cite>, unless both parties agree to amend it. Articles 2.11.1 and 2.11.2 require consent and notice of the DIO<sup><a href="#ninety1">91</a></sup> for any transfer of power between the federal and territorial governments. Although territorial and federal laws still apply, if they are incompatible with the <cite>Agreement</cite>, the  <cite>Agreement</cite> prevails.<sup><a href="#ninety2">92</a></sup> However, the <cite>Agreement</cite> is not as final as other land claims settlements because it anticipates a future enactment that will complement the powers already delegated in the <cite>Agreement</cite>. The federal and territorial governments and the Inuit have agreed that any subsequent accords concerning the creation of the Nunavut territory will be distinct from the <cite>Agreement</cite>. However, the <cite>Agreement</cite> and the creation of Nunavut are not divorced from each other. The connection between the two will surface once Nunavut becomes a territory in 1999. This is reinforced by Isaac:
<blockquote>
[B]ecause the creation of the territory is an integral part of the agreement, the territory itself will become constitutionalized. It is too early to say what the results of this would be, suffice it to say that once Nunavut is created, it could not be dismantled unilaterally by the federal government. To this extent, Nunavut represents something more than a traditional territory (like the Yukon) and something less than a province.<sup><a href="#ninety3">93</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The history of negotiations has demonstrated that obtaining a Nunavut political territory was the primary consideration for surrendering unextinguished Inuit title.<sup><a href="#ninety4">94</a></sup> Aboriginal rights and political power may be mutually exclusive in the <cite>Agreement</cite>, but the <cite>Agreement</cite> and the future accord creating the Nunavut government will place a viable and culturally harmonious territory on the Canadian map.
<p>
Determining Nunavut's place in the Canadian family could be problematic. If Nunavut is acknowledged as a new Territory, comprised of devolved powers from the Northwest Territories, its constitutional validity could not be challenged by other provinces.<sup><a href="#ninety5">95</a></sup> However, if Nunavut is deemed to be a province, the process of its creation may have to comply with constitutional requirements of approval from seven of the ten provinces having a minimum of fifty percent of the country's population.<sup><a href="#ninety6">96</a></sup> This is of serious concern since two provinces, Quebec and Newfoundland, have their own Inuit populations who may increase their demands on their respective governments or suddenly migrate to Nunavut. This may suggest that these provincial governments mistreat their native populations, which would undermine their credibility in Canada. These considerations could influence Quebec, which, as the second most populous province, is a significant party in negotiating constitutional amendments.<sup><a href="#ninety7">97</a></sup> 
<p>
It is more likely that Nunavut will be a territory. A limitation on the jurisdiction of Nunavut is that most of its power
will be transferred from the territorial government, whose powers are less entrenched than those of the provinces.<sup><a href="#ninety8">98</a></sup> Delegated powers from a territory could not provide the jurisdiction that other provinces have. Isaac comments:
<blockquote>
On the face of it, the Nunavut territory would provide self-governing status to the Inuit who live in the settlement area to the extent provided by normal territorial government. This is laudable. However, a problem with this arrangement is that territorial governments do not have their own constitution and, because they are created by federal statute, are subject to federal legislative authority. It is submitted that this aspect of the agreement, the fact that Nunavut would be ultimately subject to federal jurisdiction seriously curtails Aboriginal (in this case, Inuit) aspirations for self-government. Notwithstanding the agreement, the territorial form of self-government places the Inuit under direct federal authority with no assurance of an adequate financial base (for government).<sup><a href="#ninety9">99</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The Northwest Territories do not have exclusive powers as the provinces do under s. 92 of the <cite>BNA Act</cite>.<sup><a href="#onehundred">100</a></sup> Territorial powers are a product of federal legislation that can be amended unilaterally by the federal government. Although the <cite>Agreement</cite> cannot be altered without Inuit consent, Nunavut jurisdiction will always be subject to federal delegation. 
<p>
However, since Nunavut powers flow from territorial and federal sources, there will not be an encroachment on any provincial powers. Without any interference with provincial authority, a more prominent form of public government can emerge. This contrasts with southern First Nations, who must carve their autonomy out of provincial jurisdictions. The consignment of power from the Territories and Federal government will meet fewer obstacles than would be encountered with a province, which, unlike the Territories, holds ownership to Crown lands and natural resources.<sup><a href="#one01">101</a></sup> This has been a fundamental barrier to obtaining more jurisdiction in Quebec, which the aboriginal peoples under the <cite>JBNQA</cite> were forced to overcome.<sup><a href="#one02">102</a></sup>
<p>
The anticipated formation of a new territory deepens the impression that Nunavut will be considered a distinct political entity, with its own governing institutions, in Canada.<sup><a href="#one03">103</a></sup> Nunavut,
like the current provinces and territories, will be an archetype of public government grounded in representative democracy. Much like Quebec, Nunavut will be a socially and culturally identifiable entity in the Canadian federal system. As Canadian history has demonstrated, the federal government has continually accommodated the distinct nature of Quebec because of the strength of its cultural homogeneity. Nunavut, with an active Inuit majority, could be another culturally and ethnically distinct region that shares international connections outside Canada. Mirroring Quebec's ties to Francophone countries, the Inuit could align with other nations in the Arctic Circumpolar region such as Greenland, Russia and Norway. Similarly to the Quebec experience, Nunavut is not designed to undercut the fabric of Canadian unity but to enrich it.<sup><a href="#one04">104</a></sup> A government that represents a culturally homogeneous constituency has been referred to as &quot;ethnic self-government.&quot;<sup><a href="#one05">105</a></sup> The explicit assignment of self-government in a land claim could never match the recognition Nunavut will have as an identifiably unique governing region in Canada.
<p>
The discourse on Nunavut's contribution to Canadian federalism fails to address how the <cite>Agreement</cite> and the Nunavut government will address the local needs of the Inuit. The issue of establishing mechanisms to ameliorate conditions in the communities and respond to future challenges will have to be resolved. The fundamental question is whether the <cite>Agreement</cite>, in terms of government policy, can &quot;contribute positively to a lasting solution of cultural, social and economic problems that for too long have kept the Indian and Inuit people in a disadvantaged position within the larger Canadian society.&quot;<sup><a href="#one06">106</a></sup> Significant changes in three areas---namely economic development and employment, land-use management, and community participation---will be integral to a promising future for Nunavut. These are the major policy issues that are currently being discussed in the Northwest Territories today. In addition, an examination of community justice reveals how an Inuit response to social problems plaguing communities will help the Inuit begin the process of regaining full control over their lives and their people.
<p>
 <h3>Particulars of the Agreement</h3>

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT
<p>
Financing the new territory of Nunavut is an extremely expensive proposition in light of the low economic base in the region. Currently only a few communities are economically developed. Unemployment is rampant and job opportunities are scarce. A transformation of the Inuit economy will be a comprehensive task because of a widespread subsistence lifestyle that is funded through government assistance. A successful Nunavut economy with extensive employment opportunities is needed to lessen the social and economic reliance on the government. Without it, political power will become meaningless when eligibility for compensation expires.<sup><a href="#one07">107</a></sup>
<p>
In the <cite>Agreement</cite>, the Nunavut Trust is responsible for managing income from royalties and compensation payments. The Nunavut Inuit have obtained larger benefits on land resource royalties than were given under the <cite>JBNQA</cite> and the <cite>Inuvialuit Agreement</cite>.<sup><a href="#one08">108</a></sup> It is anticipated that revenue sharing, equity participation options and eventually resource jurisdiction will follow in any Nunavut constitution, rendering fiscal management more burdensome.<sup><a href="#one09">109</a></sup> How this money is administered will be crucial. Both the Inuvialuit Investment
Corporation (IIC) and the Makivik Corporation under the <cite>JBNQA</cite>, monitor land claim compensation and profits from their lands. Since their inception, both organizations have augmented their corporate portfolio, earning dividends that contribute to social and economic development in the communities. Their success has been attributed to sound fiscal planning.<sup><a href="#one10">110</a></sup> It is this type of management that can ensure lasting financial security for the Inuit and a healthy Nunavut economy. 
<p>
However, opportunities for short-term economic stability in the communities are limited. The community level is where employment must be available, providing individuals with an option to work and live at the same location. Economic planning must recognize that business and development should be allocated to all communities. Consolidating opportunities only in the larger administrative centres will encourage community members, who are dependent on or depended on by their families, to leave. According to the <cite>Scone Report</cite>,<sup><a href="#one11">111</a></sup> there is only one Nunavut community, Nanisivik, a mining community with mostly
white residents, which is regarded as economically developed.<sup><a href="#one12">112</a></sup>
Employment opportunities in the North have traditionally been created by the government. Therefore, private business and industry are needed to remove any dependence the Inuit would have on the public sector for employment.
<p>
Current economic reality dictates a reliance on federal and territorial funding. This dependence is probably more grave than in any have-not province in Canada.<sup><a href="#one13">113</a></sup> A majority of the Inuit in Nunavut are unemployed and therefore are overly dependent on government funding. This is an unfortunate consequence of the rapid transformation of Inuit life from one of subsistence, living among family units, to relocation in communities where education, housing, health care, social services, and other goods were freely available. The marginal feasibility of earning a livelihood through traditional hunting, fishing, and trapping activities, which have suffered from a dwindling fur trade market and seal hunting industry, also contributes to unemployment. The decreasing market for goods acquired from hunting has increased the need for government welfare assistance. More Inuit are being forced to seek employment in the modern economy, with a limited job
market.<sup><a href="#one14">114</a></sup>
<p>
Subsistence livelihood has traditionally been a method of self-sufficiency. However, many young Inuk are not familiar with the essential hunting, fishing, and trapping techniques.<sup><a href="#one15">115</a></sup> The pervasiveness of Canadian culture, spread through television, transportation, and other aspects of modern life,
has substantially altered the community environment and as a result has removed the necessity for a young Inuk to live a traditional life.<sup><a href="#one16">116</a></sup> The availability of welfare has hastened the replacement of subsistence living with a monetary system. The hardships of being solely dependent on hunting and fishing act as a deterrent to a subsistence lifestyle when the conveniences and services that the state provides are easily obtainable. Furthermore, due to technological advances, it is more costly to equip hunters. This creates a situation in which individuals who can afford to hunt and fish do not have the time to do so because of work obligations, while the unemployed, with the opportunity to hunt and fish, cannot finance the equipment.<sup><a href="#one17">117</a></sup>
<p>
Economic planning in Nunavut must address the social problems evolving from massive unemployment and the inability to live off the land due to socio-economic transformation.<sup><a href="one18">118</a></sup> Solutions should attempt to abridge the old culture with the new. Jobs should be structured in a way that is flexible enough to prevent interference with seasonal hunting and fishing. Encouraging people to work is a difficult
enough proposition considering the availability of government assistance. Economic planning should offer incentives for people to work. Without a willing work force, economic development stagnates.
<P>
The <cite>Agreement</cite> creates numerous bureaucratic positions and includes the objective of representative Inuit employment in them.<sup><a href="#one19">119</a></sup> The future administrators of the state are expected to emerge from a new generation of Inuit, thus satisfying the <cite>Agreement</cite>'s objectives of encouraging self-reliance and of increasing the cultural and social well-being of the Inuit.<sup><a href="#one20">120</a></sup> Education and training will be required for these roles, in addition to fluency in Inuktitut and an understanding of Inuit culture. However, contemporary data reveal there is no large pool of qualified Inuit currently available.<sup><a href="#one21">121</a></sup> The lack of interest in scholastic pursuits among
younger Inuit might be attributable to the absence of any perceived benefits of an education in communities where very little employment is available. This disincentive is reinforced by the accessibility to welfare payments without educational requirements.<sup><a href="#one22">122</a></sup>
<p>
From the younger generation of Inuit comes a group of potential employees who are unqualified and ill-prepared to work for the government.<sup><a href="#one23">123</a></sup> While qualifications for employment are unnecessary for various wildlife management boards and regional organizations in the <cite>Agreement</cite>, they will be necessary for the Nunavut administration's civil service. Without trained Inuit during the early days of Nunavut, it will be necessary to recruit Qallunaat (whites) to staff Nunavut positions.<sup><a href="#one24">124</a></sup> Nunavut legislative directives instituting affirmative action programs cannot compensate
for the lack of Inuit with professional skills.<sup><a href="#one25">125</a></sup> To reduce this disparity, training and education programs must be engineered to effect a meaningful change in bureaucratic representation. Incentives should exist to attract individuals with local expertise to seek government jobs, thus taking control of their administration. Without it, the flourishing of Inuit aspirations in Nunavut will remain dormant, mirroring the previous era.
<p>
The current reliance on the government for social assistance should not be transposed to a reliance on government for employment. Facilitating private economic development might be a way to loosen the overdependence on government for employment as well as to reduce the government payroll.<sup><a href="#one26">126</a></sup> Relying on the government for employment can lead to the stagnation of economic growth by dissuading the Inuit of the need for private initiative.<sup><a href="#one27">127</a></sup> However, the major difficulty for Nunavut economic development is the absence of an entrepreneurial tradition among the population.<sup><a href="#one28">128</a></sup> Therefore, any stratagem must account for the cultural and psychological barriers to a &quot;business&quot; orientation. Cultivating an economic infrastructure, in both a traditional and modern sense, and in both private and public spheres, is untenable without an educated, skilled, or trained population in addition to an entrepreneurial spirit.<sup><a href="#one29">129</a></sup>
<p>
LAND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
<p>
Economic planning will have important implications for political stability in Nunavut. Decisions about economic development are necessarily related to resource management in the Eastern Arctic. Having to balance a project's economic opportunities with its impact on the region's natural resources will often put the Inuit in a precarious situation. However, what is more noteworthy is that the Inuit have an effective voice in these matters, because of shared administrative responsibility on numerous tribunals. Participation in this area is meaningful to the Inuit, who culturally identify themselves with their environment.
<p>
Incentives to develop the area must be offered to assist in improving the economic situation. Soliciting development has always been difficult in a land that is relatively inaccessible to the south and thus unattractive for companies due to the exorbitant operational costs involved. In addition, investors in the south have viewed the northern authorities as being too stringent environmentally, or as having created a process that is overregulated.<sup><a href="#one30">130</a></sup> This problem has been inimical to economic development in the Northwest Territories, where overlap, duplication, and over-bureaucratization due to both federal and territorial government involvement have deterred developers from investing.<sup><a href="#one31">131</a></sup>
<p>
The Nunavut regulatory regime amalgamates the three government systems into one process. A number of boards' decisions must still obtain ministerial approval, but the vertical structure used in the <cite>Inuvialuit</cite> region, with three different environmental assessment processes, has been replaced by a horizontal arrangement, in which a number of different boards operate concurrently. The simplification of the assessment process has resulted in growing optimism about future development in Nunavut.<sup><a href="#one32">132</a></sup>
<p>
Determining the balance between the facilitation of non-renewable resource development and responsible environmental management will be problematic. The difficulty has already surfaced at the Cullaton Lake Mine, where the Inuit Development Corporation entered into a financial arrangement for compensation which the Inuit
Tapirisat of Canada perceived as being too accommodating to mine exploration and unchecked development.<sup><a href="#one33">133</a></sup> While this conundrum may plague every government, its ramifications are more serious for the Inuit, whose daily existence is linked with a healthy environment. The land
claims process has been criticized as issuing a <i>de facto</i> licence for natural non-renewable resource exploitation, since it is the underlying reason that the government consents to any land claims agreement.<sup><a href="#one34">134</a></sup> This contrasts with Inuit values, in which cultural and spiritual identity is preserved by a healthy and sustainable environment.<sup><a href="#one35">135</a></sup>
<p>
However, natural resource development is not exclusively a government interest.
<blockquote>
The road to self-determination and self-government is paved with capital resources. With money comes power. With no money to carry out the desires of a self-determining, self-governing people, all the &quot;rights&quot; in the world will not effect any change in current conditions.<sup><a href="#one36">136</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The Inuit have historically integrated themselves into the Qallunaat's economic ventures in the north, such as trapping and whaling, which have provided economic benefits for the people. While there is little disagreement about the vast potential for northern prosperity and the corresponding need for economic integration, the Inuit have grown disillusioned by the repeated practice of businesses emigrating once the feasibility of the venture becomes suspect. Fuelling this disenchantment is the minimal reinvestment of the returns from these operations into the communities.<sup><a href="#one37">137</a></sup> The historically transient nature of these operations could cause Nunavut administrators to be sceptical of development. Immediate economic rewards may be enticing, but project approval could also be made contingent on guarantees for long-term social, economic, and cultural protection.
<p>
One approach could be to encourage Inuk developers, contractors, and employees to participate in the resource industry. This could mitigate the reliance on natural resources development, which is usually directed by outside interests.<sup><a href="#one38">138</a></sup> Currently, there is very little Inuit participation in resource development. &quot;[S]haring the wealth&quot;<sup><a href="#one39">139</a></sup> accrued from
settlement lands is at the heart of the Nunavut agenda. It would prevent situations where projects are managed by individuals who have no stake in the long-term interests of the area.<sup><a href="#one40">140</a></sup> A consolidated political voice in Nunavut could effectively lead to a fuller understanding of Inuit needs, and, incidentally, a better dialogue between Nunavut regulators and foreign companies. A useful example is the Inupiat of the North Slope of Alaska, under the <cite>Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act</cite>,<sup><a href="#one41">141</a></sup> whose input into resource development in their area has led to modifications of
development operations.<sup><a href="#one42">142</a></sup> The relationship is not intended to be
oppositional but rather a cooperative one based on respect for the people whose land is being used.
<p>
One possible way to compensate for the limited representation in development operations is to implement a public assistance program that funds Inuit-operated ventures. Subsidization of these projects could counterbalance the advantages developers wield in capital resources. Other approaches in the <cite>Agreement</cite> include a
government contract bidding process which is designed to favour Inuit businesses.<sup><a href="#one43">143</a></sup> In addition, if a project will have a socio-economic impact on the area, one constructive form of the compensation called for in the <cite>Agreement</cite> could be a direction to a developer to create employment opportunities for the Inuit.<sup><a href="#one44">144</a></sup> However, this discretion should be exercised cautiously since quota systems for hiring in the past have been unsuccessful. Moreover, they have unnerved the mining industry.<sup><a href="#one45">145</a></sup>
<p>
Inuit involvement in the development process can manifest itself in other ways. The <cite>Agreement</cite> establishes numerous tribunals and boards, composed of equal numbers of Nunavut residents and government administrators, to manage the lands, water, and wildlife in the area.<sup><a href="#one46">146</a></sup> The requirement of Inuit representation on these boards amply illustrates how far aboriginal rights have developed over the last 100 years. Instead of aboriginal peoples having a personal and usufructuary right, limited by the discretion of the Crown to extinguish it,<sup><a href="#one47">147</a></sup> the Inuit in the <cite>Agreement</cite> maintain regulatory power to manage and monitor non-native use of the land. They are also entitled to compensation for any development project in Nunavut, to be worked out prior to its commencement, that qualitatively or quantitatively affects the water in Inuit Owned Lands.<sup><a href="#one48">148</a></sup> Access to Inuit lands or subsurface materials must be approved by the DIO.<sup><a href="#one49">149</a></sup> Furthermore, consultation with the Inuit is also required for all petroleum exploration on
Crown and Inuit lands in the Settlement Area.<sup><a href="#one50">150</a></sup> The days are past when Inuit concerns could be neglected or ignored.
<p>
Some of the stated objectives in the Agreement include the clarification of rights to ownership of land and resources, the provision of Inuit wildlife harvesting rights, and effective participation and involvement in decision making while exercising those rights.<sup><a href="#one51">151</a></sup> This is meaningful to a people whose source of cultural and social livelihood depends on a sound environment. However, the Nunavut environmental assessment process resembles a co-management scheme instead of self-management. Self-management is a system in which the monitoring of the land and renewable resources is done solely by users of the resources. The users become the stewards of the land, which accords with traditional aboriginal philosophy. Co-management entails shared responsibilities between two parties. It is often the case that the party that resides within the environment that is managed does not have final decision-making power. In a common co-management scheme a board's decisions are ultimately subject to government approval. This can fall well short of self-government ambitions.<sup><a href="#one52">152</a></sup>
<p>
However, the Nunavut co-management scheme is not a polarized confrontation pitting two different value systems against each other. Although government and the Inuit are not unanimous about how the Arctic should be developed and protected, there are clear, mandated objectives establishing a consensus that crosses cultural lines. A Nunavut land use strategy will contain a list of objectives that are formulated and agreed upon at the outset. This was a concession that the Inuit were seeking. Peter Ittinuar comments:
<blockquote>
We are willing to accept the principle of a ministerial veto if the Inuit are given the power to make decisions in the first instance, and if the minister's right to overrule those decisions is subject to certain agreed-upon criteria.<sup><a href="#one53">153</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The <cite>Agreement</cite> stipulates that the government shares a concern with the Inuit to develop the area in an environmentally responsible manner, with a sensitivity to the importance of natural resources to the Inuit. The stewardship responsibilities toward the land are a joint venture. The fragility of the Arctic environment and its vulnerability to the effects of development and exploitation are the responsibility of all the affected parties. 
<p>
The Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB) illustrates a co-management system with a unified agenda. It will have nine members: four appointed by the DIO, with the remainder appointed by various government officials.<sup><a href="#one54">154</a></sup> It is likely that more than four Inuk will serve on this board since the Inuit probably possess a better understanding of the issues involved than do outside bureaucrats. Furthermore, a fifth member of the Board, appointed by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, must be ordinarily resident in Nunavut.<sup><a href="#one55">155</a></sup> The board must adhere to the harvesting interests of the Inuit and the need for a healthy renewable resource economy in every decision. It is obligated to recognize the importance of effective Inuit representation in wildlife management.<sup><a href="#one56">156</a></sup> The pronouncement of guidelines and mandatory Inuit representation ensures the acknowledgement of Inuit concerns at NWMB hearings. This makes environmental co-management of the Arctic ecosystem more harmonious, since the avenues for conflict have been narrowed. 
<p>
Enforcement of the environmental objectives through the <cite>Agreement's</cite> co-management scheme adds more protection to Inuit interests. Environmental monitoring of ongoing development continues well after the approval of projects. The Nunavut Impact Review Board (NIRB) will review public and private proposals.<sup><a href="#one57">157</a></sup> As projects proceed, the government, the Nunavut Planning Commission (NPC), and possibly the NIRB will be required to ensure that the conditions of a project approval are being met.<sup><a href="#one58">158</a></sup> Enforcement of permits, certificates, or licences will be undertaken only by the
responsible government agency in conjunction with the NPC or NIRB.<sup><a href="#one59">159</a></sup> However, a DIO does have standing to seek a determination in court whether a term or condition is being fulfilled, to obtain a court order compelling a person to perform an obligation or prohibiting a developer from implementing a
term or condition of a NIRB certificate, and to seek judicial review of any decision or order.<sup><a href="#one60">160</a></sup> Therefore, a failure to comply with expressed requirements can be challenged by many parties. 
<p>
As well as being able to participate in the enforcement of environmental management, the Inuit will have access to the assessment process. A co-management framework that recognizes the value of traditional knowledge and experience, along with the scientific expertise of government officials, will allay the alienation Inuit can experience in the assessment process. Inuit knowledge of their environment is more instinctual and less reliant on scientific data.<sup><a href="#one61">161</a></sup> Traditionally, however, environmental assessment has been a fairly
regimented procedure in which copious research and exhaustive studies are conducted. This technical aspect of the regulatory process, as well as the operation of deadlines and timetables, has confused and estranged Cree and Inuit members of the various <cite>JBNQA</cite> wildlife management boards.<sup><a href="#one62">162</a></sup>
<p>
The contribution of hunters and trappers who constantly interact with the lands would lead to more responsive decision making and community involvement in the land management process.<sup><a href="#one63">163</a></sup> Information from users of the land would be a primary resource. This process would restructure the methodology in environmental management, which is conventionally a scientific endeavour. The Nunavut Wildlife Harvest Study will incorporate local knowledge by collecting data from harvesters and
conducting interviews in each community.<sup><a href="#one64">164</a></sup> As Nunavut can be divided into different ecosystems, it is more logical to decentralize the process. 
<p>
<h3>Community Development and Participation</h3>

Northern communities are characterized by their isolation. There is always an inherent danger in a comprehensive land settlement to amalgamate community interests under a larger policy.<sup><a href="#one65">165</a></sup> The consolidation of the community interest under a Nunavut policy may not recognize that each community has
evolved independently of the others. Because the communities are so distant from each other, each community's concerns may be particular  to it. Their stages of development as well as their capabilities to deliver municipal services differ greatly. The involvement of the communities, and the community members, is essential to a functioning Nunavut government. In response, the <cite>Agreement</cite> proposes an alternative to municipal government that delegates to the community certain powers, such as wildlife management, which are relevant to
the daily activities existing at the local level. Involvement in community affairs will strengthen the community and instill a sense of purpose for many Inuit. 
<p>
Article 14 of the <cite>Agreement</cite> grants existing communities in Nunavut corporate municipal status.<sup><a href="#one66">166</a></sup> Community members are to vote in a referendum concerning the alienability of their municipal lands.<sup><a href ="#one67">167</a></sup> Municipal boundaries will
encompass lands used by the community for subsistence and recreational activities, which parallels southern communities where the home and the workplace coexist within a governmental region.<sup><a href="#one68">168</a></sup>
<p>
However, municipalities are redefined in Nunavut. Land use planning and zoning are normally designated as municipal powers; this type of authority is held exclusively by Nunavut municipalities.<sup><a href="#one69">169</a></sup> But environmental protection of municipal land is also imperative because hunting, fishing, and trapping activities are often done near the community. The <cite>Agreement</cite> guarantees consultation with the municipality on wildlife management issues and regional planning decisions<sup><a href="#one70">170</a></sup> as well as monitoring harvesting practices and techniques, and basic needs levels
through the auspices of communities' Hunters and Trappers Organizations.<sup><a href="#one71">171</a></sup> Having a stronger community presence in environmental management reflects the nature of Arctic municipalities, which substantially differ from their urban counterparts. 
<p>
Nunavut municipalities will also acquire more government powers than municipalities usually have. Devolution of authority to the community level has been on the Territorial government's agenda for the last few years.<sup><a href="#one72">172</a></sup> With new powers, however, come additional expenses. This is a dilemma for a region with extremely limited resources and communities that lack the municipal infrastructure to deliver
government services. Providing adequate funding will place a heavy burden on the Nunavut treasury, even with federal and territorial support. There may be community transfer agreements, as proposed by the Territorial Government, but a logistical analysis must carefully calculate the capability of the communities to administer municipal responsibilities.<sup><a href="#one73">173</a></sup> Simply funding local services is meaningless without experienced personnel or an established infrastructure to facilitate them. Furthermore, monetary solutions are always subject to periods of financial restraint. Contribution to community development may be more effectively made through other means such as transferring food, resources, or employment opportunities.<sup><a href="#one74">174</a></sup> 
<p>
Focus on community problems will require a decentralized approach to government in Nunavut. It allows for an awareness of the local socio-economic conditions that exist at varying stages of development. Due to that diversity, government leaders can fail to comprehend the needs of each community. It is usually at this level that problems arise and that immediate action can be taken in response. Expressing community concerns in the Nunavut legislature
can integrate local needs into Nunavut policy. Moreover, it provides an outlet for reclaiming responsibilities in the communities by airing grievances to a government body that will listen. 
<p>
Community involvement and participation are essential for Nunavut. They have been the basis of the success of the <cite>Inuvialuit Agreement</cite>.<sup><a href="#one75">175</a></sup> Over the years of negotiations for
the <cite>Agreement</cite>, there has been a healthy dialogue between the communities and the leaders.<sup><a href="#one76">176</a></sup> This could be a precursor for a more consensual style of government in Nunavut. However, the communities continue to look to outsiders for community solutions. Although social workers, management consultants, and land planners greatly contribute to local development, answers to community problems should originate from internal sources as much as from outside specialists. Essentially, community members carry a better understanding of community needs. Their involvement fashions direct and swift responses. Active participation in community affairs by members of the community should destroy the myth that only professionals or educators have the best solutions. As a result, this may be the impetus needed for communities to undertake more of their own responsibilities.
<p>
<h3>A Vehicle for Community Involvement: Community Justice</h3>

The administration of a community's affairs begins with its ability to manage local disputes and social problems. Community justice acts as a means of alleviating the local strife that disrupts community harmony.<sup><a href="#one77">177</a></sup> It is an area in which communities in Nunavut are anxious to become involved, in the hope of establishing a closer connection to tradition while assuming responsibility for social ills. In areas such as criminal law, family law, and civil disputes, local participation in the process could serve as a vehicle for community expression. Moreover, community justice can react to the dangers threatening the community while promptly addressing the wrong committed by the offender. A legal &quot;system&quot;, even under Nunavut direction, can overlook the particular characteristics of the individuals and their environment, as well as how the community itself views the situation. Decentralizing the process will allow each community to resume control of its own life.
<p>
Nunavut is based on fostering independence and self-esteem for the Inuit. It is hoped that renewed pride will engender a decrease in the crime rate in the Eastern Arctic, which is alarmingly high.<sup><a href="#one78">178</a></sup> Some conclude that the large incidence of anti-social behaviour is a by-product of exposure to white industrial society.<sup><a href="#one79">179</a></sup>However, a return to the pre-colonial era is unlikely. It would be impossible to negate the influences another culture has spread to the north, because they have reoriented Inuit life, especially for younger Inuit. These influences have created a fledgling generation of youth that is maladapted and uninvolved in community life. Trapped in a cultural abyss between traditional ways
and modern society, Inuit youth remain isolated from their own communities. This social and economic dislocation, compounded by a poor educational background and unfamiliarity with traditional practices, perpetuates repeated encounters with the justice system that are inextricably linked to substance and alcohol abuse.<sup><a href="#one80">180</a></sup>
<p>
Canadian law was introduced in the north as an act of sovereignty that protected Canadian explorers in the
area.<sup><a href="#one81">181</a></sup> Inuit community methods of dispute resolution, used for many centuries, were either supplanted or not respected. One prominent example is the story of Robert Janes, a trapper in Pond Inlet who, in 1921, began to unsettle the community with menacing behaviour.<sup><a href="#one82">182</a></sup> The Inuit perceived his actions to be a serious threat to their survival. He was subsequently murdered. The following year, the R.C.M.P. was sent to investigate and try three community members for their involvement in the murder. The jury was composed of a crew from a nearby patrol boat who had no
exposure to the community's affairs. One accused was convicted of manslaughter, one convicted for aiding and abetting, and one acquitted. As one of the first instances of the application of Canadian law in the Eastern Arctic, it started a pattern in which a community's disputes were judged under an external legal system that ignored the community's consensual dispute resolution methods.
<p>
Community justice systems in conjunction with other locally generated programs can be an effective and holistic means to combat local problems. Through its focus on the individual transgressor, the process addresses social ills at the source. Counselling for the offender is continued well after the trial has ended, while attempts are made to regain and maintain a harmonious environment. In discussing the Inumarit justice committee of Arctic Bay, Bourassa J.
stated:
<blockquote>
It is obvious to me that what has been said in evidence today, that the community is willing to act, the Inumarit is willing to act and Social Services are willing to act in this case, is not an empty promise. It is true. It is a fact. It is proven in the past by the very absence of crime or disturbance. This special part of Arctic Bay is something that I would be very sad to see, in any way, taken away or diminished. The very things that the Inumarit are trying to
do, rehabilitating the offender, reconciling the offender, the victim and the community, is done so that there is unity in the community and a program of education.<sup><a href="#one83">183</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Local solutions can uphold the principles of criminal law while strengthening the communities. The political and cultural affirmation of the Inuit in Nunavut should materialize locally. This can be realized through community directed action that treats offenders and heals the community. The application of Inuit norms and customs can allay the foreignness of the criminal law system by placing it in the community context. However, community methods have not been regularly used.
<p>
Criminal sentencing may be the most unfamiliar and thus confusing part of the legal process.<sup><a href="#one84">184</a></sup> This is due to the harsh consequences that conflict with traditional sanctions orchestrated to reincorporate the offender into the community. Community justice is sometimes employed in sentencing when the court consults with community members about the best form of treatment for the individual offender that will also recognize the interests of the collective. Trial courts may consult with community groups during sentencing proceedings, thus allowing for a convergence of the two value systems. Mediating disputes prior to trial can convince the court that normal punishment is contrary to the wishes of the community. However, those attempts can be subsequently undermined by higher courts who do not appreciate the dynamics at trial.<sup><a href="#one85">185</a></sup> Appeals are even more confusing for the Inuit when higher sentences are imposed after the original sentence has been served. At this point, the offender has already been rehabilitated and has been reintegrated back into the community, thereby concluding the matter in the community's opinion.<sup><a href="#one86">186</a></sup>  The imposition of higher sentences further distances the community's interests from the legal process.
 <p>
 The overturning of community oriented sentences illustrates the &quot;incorporation&quot; model of Canadian and Inuit justice systems. Aboriginal laws and customs are recognized as a valid way to resolve disputes only to the point where they do not contradict with Canadian law.<sup><a href="#one87">187</a></sup> This model
can overlook what has taken place since the offence, such as conciliation between the offender and the community. Most crimes in the Eastern Arctic involve violence, with a large proportion of them being sexual assault. These offences have been judicially recognized as socially condemnable, deserving of significant penal consequences.<sup><a href="#one88">188</a></sup> Community sanctions that fall short of the minimum sentencing requirements are vulnerable to appeal. Therefore, there may be limited application of community justice in cases of sexual or domestic violence, which comprise a majority of the offences in the Eastern Arctic. 
<p>
Community justice cannot be dispensed in the same fashion as was done prior to Euro-Canadian contact. The traditional sanctions employed to educate the offender and heal the community may not be as effective as before.<sup><a href="#one89">189</a></sup> Social ostracism, ridicule and gossip do not affect the offender as severely because influences of Canadian culture have reduced the interdependency of community members. Withdrawing support, food, and other provisions is a futile community sanction when those goods and services are readily available from the state. Traditional sanctions were honoured because of respect for the elders' decision. That deference has been undermined among younger Inuit, who question the wisdom of the elders, whom they perceive as not understanding their needs or the pressures they are experiencing.<sup><a href="#one90">190</a></sup>
<p>
The threat of penal servitude has not been an effective deterrent either. The cycle of violence and alcoholism continues. Law can isolate the individual problem by chopping down the tree, but the roots of these sociological problems run much deeper. As the Inuit population increases, a rise rather than a drop in the crime rate is likely.<sup><a href="#one91">191</a></sup> Community input into the judicial process affords the opportunity to reveal the underlying problems, thereby prompting collective action to prevent further harm. Treatment of the offence by the community is facilitated by group involvement which continues well after the trial has ended. This also enables the community to approach the specific offence holistically by attacking the underlying social causes. The trial acts as a starting point instead of the finish. 
<p>
However, there are some concerns about community justice. For example, any sanction on the offender must be meaningful; the offender should not gain the impression that he or she has benefitted from leniency and thus has no reason to change.<sup><a href="#one92">192</a></sup> Offenders must be committed to the community sentencing process or that process is futile.<sup><a href="#one93">193</a></sup>
<p>
Another concern is that community justice systems have traditionally been less attentive to the harm to the victim than to the problems of the offender or the injury to the community. A severe punishment may be directed when the offender is considered to be beyond redemption. Short of that, the offender will participate in rigorous consultation and community service, and publicly apologize to the victim. This approach appears to be more proactive and eliminates any notions of vengeance, but it fails to acknowledge that the victim must reside, while being intimidated, ashamed, and embarrassed, in the same community as the offender. This has been a problem for many Inuit women. Those who are victims of sexual and domestic violence often encounter a lack of support mechanisms in the community and therefore have to look to outside sources.<sup><a href="#one94">194</a></sup> The community may not take into account the presence or extent of the victims' psychological and emotional injuries. Inuit women therefore demand the same censure of domestic violence and sexual abuse that the law accords in other jurisdictions.
<p>
Compounding this problem is that traditional justice systems can tailor a penalty to the individual's importance to the community, fostering inequality and capriciousness. This suggests that for some, criminal behaviour is not as condemnable as for others. The community's dependency on the offender parallels the victim's familial dependency.<sup><a href="#one95">195</a></sup> In addition, there is always a concern that any judicial body will not fully represent the diversity in the community.<sup><a href="#one96">196</a></sup> Pauktuutit (Inuit Women's Association) has voiced some scepticism about the make-up of these organizations, which are often composed of known abusers.<sup><a href="#one97">197</a></sup>
<p>
Recognition of customary law and the concept of a separate aboriginal justice system are common topics in the political forum; however, for Nunavut it was not at the forefront of the debate. Other land claims discussions have centred on this issue, but the Inuit perhaps need a period of refinement in the nascent stages of Nunavut before an alternative justice system can be formulated.<sup><a href="#one98">198</a></sup> Nunavut communities must be prepared to take more control, but this might require a period of adjustment to a new administrative system. It may be more advantageous to design a justice system when the Inuit are more comfortable with their new political status. Aboriginal justice systems have been established in other parts of Canada; however, their strength and efficacy flows from the will of the community and the receptiveness of the government toward them.<sup><a href="#one99">199</a></sup> The Department of Justice has confirmed the potential of a grassroots community justice system in the north:
<blockquote>
In the Northwest Territories the majority of the population is native, and many native people maintain close ties to a traditional lifestyle. It should be possible here, of all places, to have a justice system which serves the needs of the native community.<sup><a href="#twohundred">200</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Nunavut communities remain relatively isolated and therefore can identify with traditional mores. Moreover, the
communities are predominantly mono-cultural; thus, a community-oriented approach to justice would reflect the majority interests. However, since Nunavut communities are at varying stages of development in justice administration, any decentralized process must recognize the differences in resources and the willingness of the communities to assume justice responsibilities.
<p>
Experimentation with community justice has occurred in other land claims agreements. The Cree and the Inuit in the <cite>JBNQA</cite> exhibit two different approaches in bringing justice closer to the people. For the Cree, the appointment in each community of a judge with a broader jurisdiction than a Justice of the Peace has been used
to integrate the community perspective into the legal process. However, this approach excludes someone without a Euro-Canadian legal background because of the complexity of the issues involved.<sup><a href="#two01">201</a></sup> This may also be an inappropriate approach for Nunavut because many Inuit do not want to reside in a community in which they are constantly judging others.<sup><a href="#two02">202</a></sup> But
maintaining the Justice of the Peace Court, with its limited jurisdiction, would only uphold the status quo which conflicts with Nunavut ambitions.<sup><a href="#two03">203</a></sup>
<p>
Statutory reform may be a more viable alternative to making procedural changes or broadening a court's jurisdiction. Potentially, the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> could be adjusted to adapt to the particular circumstances and customs of the Inuit. This was promised to Inuit consignees to the <cite>JBNQA</cite>.<sup><a href="#two04">204</a></cite> Criminal laws in Greenland, which essentially cover penal sanctions, advance a number of concessions that embrace community and cultural norms, including a prohibition against any increase of a
sentence in an appeal decision. Moreover, detention is necessary only when the safety of the community is threatened. The Greenland experience reveals a codification of community justice principles, which the Nunavut government could be empowered to implement. A consolidated proposal tabled by the Nunavut legislature could
pressure the federal government more effectively than the Inuit have been able to do in Quebec. 
<p>
Nunavut will face a great need for lawyers. The administration of criminal justice powers will require people who
understand the legal challenges involved. The contractual nature of the <cite>Agreement</cite>, as well as the many questions surrounding the status of Nunavut in Canadian federalism, also necessitates the employment of legal skills. In the communities, there will be more work for a Justice of the Peace or similar mediator who would
adjudicate over by-laws, summary conviction offences, and Nunavut laws, as well as the relevant provisions of the <cite>Agreement</cite>. Current participation of Inuit in the justice process is limited to the roles of court interpreters and Justices of the Peace. There are only two Inuk lawyers, which &quot;imposes real limitations on the
ability to move Inuit into court roles and to permit the majority of the population even to understand the language of the court.&quot;<sup><a href="#two05">205</a></sup> The federal government does offer scholarships for pre-law programs at the University of Saskatchewan and the University of Ottawa; however, transplanting an Inuk into a southern environment can pose tremendous hardships. Alternatively, there are plans for the establishment of a
Nunavut law school to be coordinated by Judge Beverley Brown of the Territorial Court.<sup><a href="#two06">206</a></sup> This may assist in melding the two systems to reflect the situation in the Eastern Arctic.
<p>
In the words of the Honourable Stephen Kakwfi, Minister of Justice, Northwest Territories, &quot;Assuming justice is part of a larger process of communities taking back responsibility over their own lives.&quot;<sup><a href="#two07">207</a></sup> Community justice mechanisms offer an opportunity for the community to resolve
local disputes. However, there are concerns about community justice committees, such as their composition, their effectiveness in deterring criminal behaviour, and their accessibility to the community. The presentation of this article was purposely designed to move from a consideration of general aboriginal policy in Canada to the pressing issues at the community level. It is here that real changes in the lives of the Inuit will be measured. The proliferation of community justice is of symbolic importance; it would demonstrate that the needs and ambitions of the Inuit are being realized through the incremental accomplishments of the community. Community justice not only serves to hark back to a prouder era, but also instills goals for the personal betterment of each Inuk. Evaluating the success of the <cite>Agreement</cite> on the basis of individual advancement is perhaps the most genuine indication of a successful future for the Eastern Arctic. 
<p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

Expectations of the perfect solution for the Inuit are unrealistic. Although the <cite>Agreement</cite> may not fully satisfy ambitions of sovereignty, self-determination, or even self-government according to some definitions, its mechanisms provide tremendous opportunity for the Inuit to manage the affairs of Nunavut. In 1999, the Nunavut government will be able to tackle public issues in a jurisdiction in which the population is predominantly Inuit. The
interchange of different viewpoints, stemming from various regions and communities, will stimulate a consensus-style government. Public government enables the Inuit to confront the problems that immediately affect the Inuit, both locally and throughout Nunavut, which is a more effective form of self-government than a strictly municipal or localized one.
<p>
However, governing an enormous territory will create considerable challenges for Nunavut. Taking responsibility will require diligent attempts to address the difficulties arising from the ongoing socio-economic transformation of the Eastern Arctic. Fostering economic development can assist in providing a sense of productiveness and self-worth for the Inuit. However, this will be difficult due to a limited economic infrastructure and a population
unfamiliar with the operation of a wage economy. Nunavut is on the verge of non-renewable natural resource development that can provide the Inuit with employment opportunities and lucrative revenue from royalties. An able work force and Inuit private investors can help the Inuit start to assume control over that development. These are the factors that will determine the success in the Eastern Arctic.
<p>
Nunavut policy should be imaginative and flexible due to the unique circumstances in the north. Initial gains will be moderate at best, with a real likelihood of miscalculations and setbacks. Moreover, there will be periods of frustration during the transition when there will be a need to depend on non-Inuit consultants. However, public government necessitates cooperation and patience, which the Inuit have demonstrated over the years of negotiations.
Difficult lessons must be learned, but experience will be the best educator. An awareness of previous mistakes will help future generations improve on the existing political framework. It must be remembered that inherent in any governing body is the propensity to err. This is a characteristic of self-government.<sup><a href="#two08">208</a></sup>
<p>
Any evaluation of the success of the <cite>Agreement</cite> must begin with each community. They are the essence of the Eastern Arctic, although some have survived better than others amidst the influences of Canadian culture. Involvement in government affairs and delivery of services at the local level can instill a sense of belonging. Control over Inuit affairs can bridge the old culture with the new, thwarting the dislocation many young Inuit are
experiencing in their own communities. The next generation may have increased opportunities, precipitating an incentive to pursue education and training programs. 
<p>
Aboriginal peoples across Canada will observe Nunavut carefully to determine its viability as a strong political aboriginal voice. Purich elaborates on how Nunavut will be seen as an experiment:
<blockquote>
Nunavut may represent a substantial breakthrough for Aboriginal people. Given current prospects, Nunavut will be the first Aboriginal government to have provincial-type powers. And as such it may be the answer to those critics who fear that an Aboriginal government may not work. Nunavut may well represent the first genuine power sharing with Aboriginal people. Its creation will serve as an example of what other Aboriginals can achieve. It is important to understand that the quest for Nunavut is part of the larger struggle by Aboriginals for justice and self-government.<sup><a href="#two09">209</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Other First Nations may not fit within the Nunavut framework, which requires a majority population in an extensive
region to implement the public government model. However, the relationship that Nunavut authorities nurture with the government can open new avenues of understanding. Consequently, other models of aboriginal self-government can establish themselves in the Canadian constitutional family, facilitated by an atmosphere of trust and cooperation.

<li><a name="seven">The perception</a> that all aboriginal rights are waived by an extinguishment clause was held by the Dene/M&eacute;tis, fuelling their rejection of a 1990 comprehensive claim proposal. In turn, it appears this decision has bifurcated the Dene Nation. The Gwich'in, Sahtu, and Treaty 8 Dene are resolving their claims independently of one another while encountering internal dissension. The Dogrib have yet to do so.

extinguishable through mining regulations, it is not a proprietary right, and title does not encompass surface or subsurface rights. See ITC, <i>supra</i> note 6 at 15 and R. Pugh, &quot;Are Northern Lands Reserved for the Indians?&quot; (1981) 60 Can. Bar Rev. 36.

<li><a name="fifteen">Berger,</a> <i>supra</i> note 11; Hochstein, <i>supra</i> note 6. In <cite>Re Eskimos</cite>, [1939] S.C.R. 104, the Supreme Court concluded that the Inuit were Indians for the purpose of federal administrative responsibility under the <cite>Indian Act</cite>, R.S.C. 1985, c. I--7. This classification represented a legal perception that all First Nations, with the notable exception of the M&eacute;tis, were fundamentally similar and thus should be governed equally. In <cite>Baker Lake v. Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development</cite>, [1980] 1 F.C. 518, [1980] 5 W.W.R. 193, the legal concept of aboriginal title was extended to Inuit title on lands not under the ambit of the <cite>Royal Proclamation of 1763</cite>, R.S.C. 1870, App. 11, No. 1. (&quot;Indian&quot; title, in the Northwest Territories, was recognized in the <cite>Dominion Lands Act</cite> S.O. 1972, s. 42.)  This reinforced the perception of the sameness of Indians and Inuit, although the standards to establish aboriginal title were adjusted to appreciate the regional history of the Inuit. This is the only case in Canada where Inuit title was ever asserted. Section 35(2) of the Constitution, <i>supra</i> note 10, mirrors this perception although it posits the distinction among Inuit, Indians, and M&eacute;tis to illustrate who are Canada's aboriginal peoples.
<p>
<li><a name="sixteen">Purich,</a> <i>supra</i> note 3 at 97. Since they were never party to a treaty, the Inuit did not regard the international flavour of these agreements, where First Nations would contract with another
sovereign on an equal footing in international law, with much importance. Perhaps this explains why the Inuit rarely refer to themselves as a First Nation but more as a people. (This observation is based on numerous conversations between the author and various Inuit and Inuvialuit.)

There has been an absence of s. 35 litigation in the Northwest Territories, which suggests that it is more advantageous to resolve outstanding grievances in a land claim rather than through litigation.

<li><a name="twenty1">The plebiscite addressing</a> the proposed boundary between the eastern and western parts of the Territories on 4 May 1992 was decided in the affirmative by only a narrow majority (54% of the popular vote). Although there was strong support in the Eastern and Central Arctic, the Western Arctic population, with a high concentration of Dene and M&eacute;tis, was generally unsupportive. This opposition may have emanated from a disagreement over whether Nunavut territory infringes upon traditional Dene and M&eacute;tis lands (that is, Contwoyto Lake, Thelon Game Sanctuary), and from the concern that with a division, native peoples will no longer be a majority in the Territories, thus silencing the aboriginal voice in government affairs.

The problem of television violence has once again become a focus of public and government concern.

<blockquote>
The historian Arnold Toynbee has pointed out that 19 of 21 civilizations have died from within and not by conquests from without. He tells us that there were no bands playing or flags waving when these civilizations decayed. It  happened slowly in the quiet and the dark when no one was aware of what was happening.
<p>
A democratic society carries no inborn guarantee that it will survive on its own merits. We have seen many such societies perish even in our time. A free society cannot be taken for granted. Truth and freedom must be guarded as precious treasures. The foundation to support the civil liberties we enjoy today is dependent upon the vigilance exercised by those who can recognize and who will protect and oppose invasion of their liberties by governments, national, provincial, or municipal.<sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup>
<blockquote>
The Hon. Emmett Hall, former Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada
</blockquote>
     
We are going to continue taking a non-legalistic approach to this. We will have parents and teachers working with the industry, the industry making the decisions with a keen sense of the public interest, and not allowing futile kabuki theater arguments about free speech and censorship to pollute a debate which is really [about] a medical problem.<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup>
<blockquote>
Keith Spicer, Chairman, Canadian Radio-Television Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)

<p><br>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

Television violence, which has recently become a target of renewed concern in both Canada and the United States, raises a problem central to the debate over freedom of expression. General principles, such as fear of the `slippery slope' of regulation, are pitted against starkly presented concerns (of greater or lesser validity) about the harmful consequences of this form of expression. This conflict between the dangers of granting to the state the power
to regulate expression, and the consequences of limiting the state's power in this regard---between contingency and emergency---lies at the heart of  <cite>Charter</cite><sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup> litigation concerning unpopular speech. As this article will show, however, a so-called `emergency' may serve as a pretext for laws whose actual purpose is to advance improperly a particular moral agenda by allowing some forms of expression and restricting others.
<p>
The power of the `emergency' argument to distort perspectives on speech regulation may be seen in this article's epigraphs, both of which arose recently in the television violence debate. Taken together, they illuminate the degree to which raising the spectre of a sufficiently worrisome harm may curtail thoughtful consideration of the risks of restricting expression, and allow the government to act in the name of public safety to banish from the airwaves expression that it finds distasteful.
<p>
Viewed on its face, Hall J.'s statement seems to warn citizens to keep watch, even in &quot;the quiet and the dark,&quot; against the state's slow encroachment on their liberty. &quot;[G]overnments, national, provincial, or municipal,&quot; are the subject of Hall J.'s warning. In its 1993 report on television violence, however, the
House of Commons' Standing Committee on Communications and Culture gives Hall's words a radically different interpretation:
<blockquote>
[S]ocieties can disintegrate from within if the values that these societies cherish are allowed to decay by a slow, subtle attrition. Justice Hall reminds us that a society needs to be vigilant in opposing such an invasion of its democratic values.
<p>
The Committee believes that the problem . . .  of  television violence . . . could lead to the fraying of our modern civilization unless a comprehensive strategy is developed to arrest such invidious progress.<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The Committee shifts its concern from a fear that the liberty to express certain values may be taken away to a warning that the <i>wrong</i> values may hold sway, effectively clothing a moral concern in the language of impending social crisis. CRTC Chairman Keith Spicer's comments take this approach further, removing the expression in question from the sphere of right or wrong values and classifying it as a &quot;medical problem.&quot;<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup>
<p>
This represents a triumph of the `emergency' approach to speech restrictions; once a particular form of expression is viewed as giving rise to a health concern, rather than simply representing a statement of values, concerns about the appropriateness of state censorship may be considered academic and swept aside. Underneath this characterization of the issue, however, the presence of a fundamentally <i>moralistic</i> viewpoint can still be sensed, a viewpoint that is only tenuously connected to any real sense of emergency.
<p>
Events suggest that concerns about the appropriateness of state censorship are hardly academic. In October 1993, in response to government pressure, the Canadian Association of Broadcasters (CAB), a private broadcasting industry group, released a revised code (&quot;the Code&quot;) regulating televised violence on private networks;<sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup> the Code took effect on January 1, 1994.<sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup> The Code imposes content and scheduling restrictions on programming for both children and adults, and establishes a ratings and warning system to alert viewers to violent programming. The Code will be administered by a private
body, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC). The CRTC has told broadcasters, however, that adherence to the Code will be a &quot;condition of licence.&quot;<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup>
<p>
This article will examine the Code's legal implications, focusing on whether it constitutes an unconstitutional infringement of the guarantee of freedom of expression in s. 2(b) of the <cite>Charter</cite>.<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup> Part I will briefly recount the events leading to the Code's introduction. Part II will describe the Code and how it is administered. Part III will examine the conflicting social science research which has served as the basis for government action, and which would be an issue in any future <cite>Charter</cite> challenge. Part IV examines issues that would arise in a constitutional challenge to the Code. Even if the regulations are viewed as more than private rules, they would likely survive a challenge as &quot;reasonable limits prescribed by law . . .  [and] demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society,&quot;<sup><a href="#ten">10</a></sup> though it will be argued that a number of persuasive constitutional arguments can and should be raised against the Code. Part V will look at the implications of allowing such content regulations. 
<p>
Finally, Parts VI and VII will suggest that these content regulations do not constitute appropriate state action. While they purport to address a social emergency, the real effect of the television violence regulations is to attempt to enforce an orthodoxy of values. This may conform to the civic republican viewpoint in legal theory, which would allow speech regulation in order to serve fundamental democratic goals and values. Ultimately, however, the moralistic approach may undermine other justifications for protecting freedom of expression. This approach is further supported by a widespread &quot;profound sense of ambivalence about Canada's mass media,&quot;<sup><a href="#eleven">11</a></sup> a feeling which has arguably led to the unjustified result that the broadcast media are more strictly regulated than any other medium of expression.
 <p>
<h3>I.   History of the Code</h3>

Televised violence has been the object of Canadian government attention on previous occasions. Most notably, in the mid-1970's, the Ontario government established the LaMarsh Commission, which was asked to explore the broader issue of &quot;the possible harm to the public interest of the increasing exploitation of violence in the communications industry,&quot; including the broadcast media.<sup><a href="#twelve">12</a></sup>
<p>
More recently, renewed interest in the subject was spurred by several events which occurred in 1992. First, in May of that year, the CRTC released a study which examined past social science research on the effects of televised violence and concluded that &quot;most studies agree that there is a positive, though weak, relation between
exposure to television violence and aggressive behaviour.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup> (An earlier study had detailed the results of previous inquiries into media violence, and summarized broadcasting standards in other countries.)<sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup>
<p>
Second, a 14-year-old girl, Virginie Larivi&egrave;re, convinced that televised violence was responsible for the sexual assault and murder of her 11-year-old sister, gathered the signatures of 1.3 million Canadians on a petition urging Parliament to force a reduction in onscreen violence; the petition was referred by Parliament to the Standing Committee on Communications and Culture on November 18, 1992.<sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup> This led to hearings by the Committee, and a subsequent Committee report entitled <cite>Fraying Our Social Fabric</cite> which was drafted by a Sub-Committee on Violence on Television. The report concluded: 
<blockquote>
The inconclusiveness of [the link between televised and actual violence] . . .  has led us away from recommending that the government legislate outright against television violence at this time. Instead, we have come to the conclusion that the problem of violence should be addressed co-operatively, by all the players, including the industry, parents and governments, and with minimal legislative intervention.<sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup>
</blockquote>
At the same time, CRTC Chairman Spicer made speeches to industry representatives, urging them to take action themselves. He told the Committee that &quot;a tough industry code and an effective standards council were two critical elements the industry had to deliver on.&quot;<sup><a href="#seventeen">17</a></sup> The Canadian Association of Broadcasters, which includes most private broadcasting networks but does not include the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), pay-TV, or specialty networks, responded in May 1992 with meetings of its Joint Societal Issues and Trends Committee to consider a revised violence code with stricter terms for member networks;<sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup> the initial code, published in 1987, lacked CRTC approval.<sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a></sup>
<p>
It is important to note that the Code, although promulgated by the CAB, is in fact the direct result of substantial government pressure. Spicer has referred to the CRTC's approach as one of &quot;masterful wooing.&quot;<sup><a href ="#twenty">20</a></sup> While stating its preference for voluntary solutions, the
Commission warns: &quot;Already an impressive number of Canadians are demanding . . .  coercive action. If we cannot make progress by the voluntary, cooperative route, it's clear that pressure on politicians for legislative or other legal solutions may become overwhelming.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty1">21</a></sup> The Hon. Perrin
Beatty, the former Minister of Communications, also made it clear that the CAB's actions would meet with strict government scrutiny: &quot;The Canadian Association of Broadcasters has just rewritten their code and it remains to be seen how effective it will be. If it isn't tough enough, I will ask the CRTC to write and enforce one that is.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty2">22</a></sup>
<p>
<h3>II.   Provisions and Administration of the Code</h3>

The Code's provisions may be divided according to their function: content regulation affecting programming for children and adults, regulatory guidelines for news and public affairs programming, scheduling regulations, and program advisories and classifications.
<p>
Section 1 of the Code, entitled &quot;Content,&quot; opens with a general prohibition: 
<blockquote>
Canadian broadcasters shall not air programming which:
<ul>
<li>contains gratuitous violence in any form*
<p>
<li>sanctions, promotes or glamorizes violence
<blockquote>
* &quot;Gratuitous&quot; means material which does not play an integral role in developing the plot, character or theme of the material as a whole.<sup><a href="#twenty3">23</a></sup>
</blockquote></ul></blockquote>
More specifically, the Code prohibits programming which &quot;sanctions, promotes or glamorizes&quot; violence against women<sup><a href="#twenty4">24</a></sup> or animals,<sup><a href="#twenty5">25</a></sup> or violence &quot;based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, or mental or physical disability.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty6">26</a></sup> No definition of &quot;sanctions, promotes or glamorizes&quot; is given. The section dealing with violence against women does provide one further direction,
noting that any violence which is present must be &quot;integral to the story being told.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty7">27</a></sup>
<p>
Section 2 provides a series of regulations concerning children's programming, defined as programming targeted at children under 12. Broadcasters are cautioned: &quot;Very little violence, either physical, verbal or emotional shall be portrayed in children's programming.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty8">28</a></sup>
<p>
The regulations also determine the permissible parameters of televised violence in children's programming. Violence involving &quot;real-life characters&quot; shall be limited to occasions &quot;when it is essential to the development of character and plot&quot;; animated shows are &quot;accepted as a stylized form of storytelling which can contain non-realistic violence,&quot; but the violence cannot be the show's &quot;central theme,&quot; nor may it invite &quot;dangerous imitation.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty9">29</a></sup> Realistic scenes of
violence must not &quot;create the impression that violence is the preferred way, or the only method to resolve conflict between individuals&quot;; they must also &quot;portray, in human terms, the consequences of that violence to its victims and its perpetrators.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty">30</a></sup> More generally,
broadcasters are told to &quot;deal carefully&quot; with themes that &quot;could threaten their [children's] sense of security,&quot; or which could lead to imitation---for example, &quot;dangerous physical acts such as climbing apartment balconies or rooftops.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty1">31</a></sup>
<p>
The Code's regulation of news and public affairs programs consists mostly of rules which leave decisions in the hands of the broadcaster. News departments are urged to use &quot;appropriate editorial judgment,&quot; &quot;caution,&quot; or &quot;discretion&quot; in reporting on and showing violence, aggression, and &quot;explicit or graphic language related to stories of destruction, accidents or sexual violence, which could disturb children and their families.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty2">32</a></sup> They are warned to be particularly cautious in covering domestic terrorism or civil unrest, &quot;to ensure news coverage does not become a factor in inciting additional violence.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty3">33</a></sup> The Code adds: &quot;While broadcasters shall not exaggerate or exploit situations of aggression, conflict or confrontation, equal care shall be taken not to sanitize the reality of the human condition.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty4">34</a></sup> Finally, the Code tells broadcasters to refer to the Code of Ethics of the Radio-Television News Directors Association of Canada &quot;for guidance regarding broadcast journalism in general.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty5">35</a></sup>
<p>
The Code's scheduling provisions restrict programs, promotions, and advertisements containing &quot;scenes of violence intended for adult audiences&quot; to the time slot between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m.,<sup><a href="#thirty6">36</a></sup> thus establishing a &quot;watershed&quot; point similar to the one imposed by broadcasters in England at the behest of the British government.<sup><a href="#thirty7">37</a></sup> Canadian broadcasters sometimes import and air over their stations the broadcast signals of American programs, a practice known as substitution; the Code says that when Canadian broadcasters substitute the broadcast signals of American programs that air before the watershed hour, the prohibition against scenes of violence does not apply. But CAB members are warned &quot;at no time [to] avail themselves of substitution rights over programming which contains gratuitous violence in any form or which sanctions, promotes or glamorizes violence.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty8">38</a></sup>
<p>
Finally, the Code sets up a classification and warning regime. The classification categories have not yet been released; the Code simply says they will &quot;provide guidelines on content and the intended audience for programming.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty9">39</a></sup> As for warnings, the Code directs broadcasters to air viewer advisory notices alerting audiences to programs containing violent scenes which are &quot;intended for adult audiences.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty">40</a></sup>
<p>
Primary responsibility for administering the Code rests in the hands of the CBSC, an independent industry standards council established in part to provide a review process for viewers' complaints that is independent of the CRTC. The process allows broadcasters an opportunity to respond to complaints; then, if a CBSC regional council finds that the broadcaster is at fault, the offending network must prominently announce that judgment on the air.<sup><a href="#forty1">41</a></sup>  
<p>
The CRTC has announced that broadcasters who are members in good standing of the CBSC---and thus who presumably comply with the Code---will be considered to have met the licence requirement of following the Code, but it promises to &quot;monitor closely the resolution of complaints about television violence.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty2">42</a></sup> Private broadcasters who are not CBSC members are also required to follow the Code's
dictates.<sup><a href="#forty3">43</a></sup>
<p>
<h3>III.   Social Science Research on Televised Violence</h3>

Before considering the constitutionality of the Code, it is important to have some understanding of the results of social science research into the issue of the consequences of televised violence. This subject has been amply covered elsewhere.<sup><a href="#forty4">44</a></sup> Nevertheless, the research is central to constitutional arguments that may be made both for and against the Code. It may have particular impact on the question of whether the courts should be deferential to government justifications for content regulation, thus adding more weight to the state's side
of the underlying emergency-contingency debate.
<p>
Despite the mass of research on the subject---one study estimated that there are over 1,000 research publications on the relationship between televised and real violence<sup><a href="#forty5">45</a></sup>---conclusions about the relationship have remained remarkably tentative. One set of researchers concludes that &quot;[t]he evidence at present favors the hypothesis that exposure to television violence increases the likelihood of subsequent aggressiveness.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty6">46</a></sup> Another group asserts: &quot;This study did not find evidence that television violence was causally implicated in the development of aggressive behavior patterns among children and adolescents . . . ,&quot; adding later that &quot;if such children exist, they constitute such a small portion of the sample that we could not draw conclusions from observing them.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty7">47</a></sup> Even studies reaching strong conclusions often add caveats to their findings, as one writer noted:
<blockquote>
The carefully modulated rhythms of conclusiveness and caution are played and replayed. A major general finding is put forward, it is carefully modified, and then it is subtly reinstated again . . .  Over and over again, the weight of the collective evidence is invoked and then cautiously softened . . . <sup><a href="#forty8">48</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The uncertainty in the field can be attributed to two methodological difficulties. First, social scientists have suggested that laboratory experiments on the subject create an unnatural environment which does not reflect television viewing in the real-world environment, and that the experiments cannot effectively measure subjects' propensity to be more aggressive in real situations.<sup><a href="#forty9">49</a></sup> Second, surveys and field experiments have been faulted for their inability to determine whether behavioural changes are caused by television viewing or other environmental factors.<sup><a href="#fifty">50</a></sup>
<p>
Indeed, despite over three decades of study in the field, the most generally agreed-upon statement appears to be one made virtually at the dawn of research into television violence: 
<blockquote>
For <i>some</i> children, under <i>some</i> conditions, <i>some</i> television is harmful . . . . For <i>most</i> children, under <i>most</i> conditions, <i>most</i> television is probably neither particularly harmful nor particularly beneficial.<sup><a href="#fifty1">51</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Given this mild conclusion, the report of the Standing Committee on Communications and Culture is appropriately restrained in its findings: 
<blockquote>
If the ongoing initiatives to reduce the amount of violence on Canadian television screens should fail, and if a higher level of government action should subsequently be required, it seems to the Committee that the government would then need more Canadian evidence than presently exists.<sup><a href="#fifty2">52</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The CRTC's conclusions, although based on the same evidence, are voiced considerably more vigorously, but they too back away from a suggestion that real violence will be the direct result of viewing televised violence. They focus less on whether television violence will result in increased acts of aggression---a result that would lend credence to claims that the issue constitutes a medical problem---and more on the exacerbation of social problems that are arguably less urgent and direct, but much easier to prove:
<blockquote>
[Studies] have pretty conclusively confirmed the link between massive, gratuitous TV violence and desensitization of children, leading to greater tolerance for real-life violence, emotional problems, school-yard bullying, and learning problems.<sup><a href="#fifty3">53</a></sup>
</blockquote>
This `defining downward' of claims about the possible effects of televised violence, from actual violence to more general symptoms of social malaise, is significant for two reasons. First, as I have indicated, it does not accord with Spicer's claim that television violence presents a &quot;medical problem,&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty4">54</a></sup> since the effects described above fall short of the direct causal link to increased violence that is the elusive object of studies in this area. Second, the CRTC position on the effects of television violence---whether the Commission asserts that television violence creates a medical problem or simply that it has unwanted social effects---would likely serve as the basis for a s. 1 test in the justification stage of a <cite>Charter</cite> challenge. Accordingly, the seriousness and likelihood of the potential social harm posited by the CRTC will influence whether the courts will uphold such an infringement under s. 1. 
<p>
Finally, it should be noted that the CAB &quot;put . . .  aside&quot; the question of the effects of televised violence when it drafted the revised Code.<sup><a href="#fifty5">55</a></sup> Any argument as to whether the government has a pressing and substantial need to infringe this speech would thus have to rely on the CRTC position.
<p>
<h3>IV.   The Constitutionality of the Code</h3>

(A)   DOES IT CONSTITUTE GOVERNMENT ACTION?
<p>
The first objection to a constitutional challenge of the Code is obvious: Why is this a constitutional problem at all?  The <cite>Charter</cite>'s strictures apply to &quot;the Parliament and government of Canada.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty6">56</a></sup> The Code is written and administered by private groups, and bears the word &quot;voluntary&quot; in its title. Why should the government be called upon to defend the constitutionality of a provision it merely endorses?
<p>
Two arguments may be raised in favour of viewing the Code as government action, or at the least as the progeny of such action. First, the Code is the direct result of the coercive powers of the CRTC and the government and its &quot;masterful wooing.&quot;  Part I, above, recounted the statements of the Standing Committee on Communications and Culture, the CRTC, and the Minister of Communications, warning private broadcasters that if they did not act, regulators would do so. It seems unreasonable to suggest that the government can achieve more through the threat of regulation than it might accomplish by actual regulation, which is subject to <cite>Charter</cite> challenge. To avoid this result, the coercive measures used by the government should be enough to bring the Code into the constitutional field.
<p>
A similar argument was raised in the United States in the 1970's, when the Federal Communications Commission (F.C.C.) adopted a tactic closely resembling the CRTC approach. In the wake of public pressure following the release of the Surgeon General's report on televised violence and the attendant Congressional hearings, the
Chairman of the FCC entered into a process of &quot;jawboning&quot; American broadcasters, urging them to self-regulate sex and violence on television &quot;without the need for any `formal' Commission action.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty7">57</a></sup> As a result, in 1975 the major broadcasters agreed to institute a &quot;family viewing hour,&quot; an hour of non-violent programming in the early evening. In an action alleging First Amendment violation, the Writers Guild of America charged that the family viewing policy resulted from the pressure that the FCC placed on the networks. 
<p>
This claim was successful in federal district court, where a judge ruled that &quot;government pressure substantially caused the adoption of the family viewing policy which deprived the individual licensees of their right and duty to make independent decisions. This deprivation violated the First Amendment.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty8">58</a></sup> The Ninth Circuit reversed the decision, on other grounds. In dicta, the Court said,
&quot;Regulation through `raised eyebrow' techniques or through forceful jawboning is commonplace in the administrative context&quot;; however, it continued, &quot;[W]e agree that the use of these techniques by the FCC
presents serious issues involving the Constitution . . . &quot;<sup><a href="#fifty9">59</a></sup> Since the  Court ruled that the case should first have gone through administrative complaint procedures, it did not decide whether the policy was the result of state action. Still, it is worth noting that this was left as a possibility.
<p>
Furthermore, the CRTC also plays a direct role in administering the Code, since its power to refuse to grant licence renewals, or to shorten licence terms, is the ultimate punishment for violating the Code. This power to disrupt broadcasters' businesses and cause serious financial losses amounts to a coercive power. It obliges broadcasters to control content to meet the CRTC's wishes, as the president of the CAB noted in testimony before the Standing Committee on Communications and Culture: 
<blockquote>
Short of very specific regulation in this area, which may be very difficult to write without creating problems under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the CRTC is now in a position to say to a broadcaster who they think is performing badly to clean up, and the next time they are around for a [licence] renewal, to give a one-year renewal instead of a five- or a seven-year renewal . . . . Do you know what that means to a company? It costs $250,000 to do another renewal application a year later, and they love that.<sup><a href="#sixty">60</a></sup>
</blockquote>
This thought is echoed in an essay by the late Bazelon J., of the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals in the United States: 
<blockquote>
[T]he government has fostered network sensitivity to government wishes by making clear that the failure to respond to the government's concept of appropriate program content would jeopardize the all-valuable license. I am reminded of one broadcaster who observed: &quot;We live or die . . .  by the FCC gun.&quot; . . .
<p>
When the right to continue to operate a lucrative broadcast facility turns on periodic government approval, even a governmental &quot;raised eyebrow&quot; can send otherwise intrepid entrepreneurs running for the cover of conformity.<sup><a href="#sixty1">61</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The CRTC has not simply exercised a power of moral persuasion here; by reserving the right to punish violations of the Code by changing licensees' status, the CRTC has made the Code a government regulation. The Commission has said that, &quot;[f]or the purposes of assessing compliance&quot; by members of the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council, it will only consider the scheduling section of the Code.<sup><a href="#sixty2">62</a></sup>
Nevertheless, this still constitutes some CRTC intervention, and it is reasonable to suppose that blatant and unchecked violation of other sections of the Code by CBSC members would also lead to CRTC action. Furthermore, non-CBSC members will also fall within the scope of CRTC regulation.<sup><a href="#sixty3">63</a></sup>
<p>
Whether the CRTC is itself a governmental body, and thus subject to the constraints of the <cite>Charter</cite>,<sup><a href="#sixty4">64</a></sup> could also be questioned, since the CRTC
for the most part acts independently of Parliament when it sets out policy and promulgates regulations. This is not truly the case, however. Although the CRTC has been independently active on the issue of television violence, the Parliament's Standing Committee on Communications and Culture clearly viewed the CRTC as a government actor when it compelled the Commission to act in Recommendation No. 19 of the <cite>Fraying Our Social Fabric</cite> report, under a section headed &quot;Legislative Action by Government&quot;: 
<blockquote>
In terms of an overall strategy for addressing violent programming on television, the Committee recommends a graduated approach. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission should begin by immediately making a few key regulations to complement the self-regulatory efforts of the industry and to symbolize the need for programming reform and, in the event that industry self-regulation proves ineffective, the Commission should then move to produce stricter regulations, giving due consideration to the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the <cite>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite>.<sup><a href="#sixty5">65</a></sup>
</blockquote>
In any case, the CRTC falls easily within the definition of a government actor articulated by the Supreme Court in <cite>McKinney v. University of Guelph</cite>.<sup><a href="#sixty6">66</a></sup> In that case, in the context of a suit alleging that several universities' mandatory retirement policies violated the <cite>Charter</cite>, the Court held that universities were not government actors. Referring to the discussion of the <cite>Canada Labour Code</cite> in <cite>Slaight Communications Inc. v. Davidson</cite>,<sup><a href="#sixty7">67</a></sup> LaForest J. noted that &quot;[i]t would be strange if the legislature and the government could evade their <cite>Charter</cite> responsibility by appointing a person to carry out the purposes of the statute.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty8">68</a></sup> He added, however, that to constitute government action, it is not enough that an actor has been created by statute; the person or entity must be acting &quot;to facilitate the performance of tasks assigned to government.&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty9">69</a></sup>
<p>
This definition surely embraces the CRTC. Section 3(2) of the <cite>Broadcasting Act</cite><sup><a href="#seventy">70</a></sup> suggests that the objectives of the government's broadcasting policy as set out in the Act should be secured by a &quot;single independent public authority&quot;---a clear description of the CRTC. Its power and purpose plainly derive from the Act, and from its role as the vehicle for the achievement of the government's broadcasting policy goals. Since the Commission and its duties are wholly a creation of the government, it cannot be said to be carrying out some traditional, non-governmental function. 
<p>
It is argued, then, that the combination of extralegal pressure and actual regulation by the CRTC, a government body, brings the Code within the field of constitutional challenge. Further discussion in this article proceeds on the assumption that the Code is effectively a government regulation. Even if one does not accept this argument, it is still worthwhile to press on in considering the Code's constitutionality, given the warnings by legislators and regulators
that they may yet introduce statutory or regulatory provisions.
<p>
(B)   DOES THE CODE INFRINGE THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION?
<p>
If the Code can be treated as government regulation, it is likely that it would be viewed as an infringement of freedom of expression. The bedrock test of infringement is stated in <cite>Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (A.-G.)</cite>:
<blockquote>
We cannot, then, exclude human activity from the scope of guaranteed free expression on the basis of the content or meaning being conveyed. <i>Indeed, if the activity conveys or attempts to convey a meaning, it has expressive content and</i> prima facie <i>falls within the scope of the guarantee</i>.<sup><a href="#seventy1">71</a></sup>
</blockquote>
This does not suggest that the meaning conveyed must be significant; it merely notes that activity whose purpose is the conveyance of meaning may be considered <i>prima facie</i> expression, thus distinguishing expressive acts from non-expressive acts.
<p>
Applying this test, several of the Code's regulations clearly regulate &quot;expression.&quot;  Section 1.1 prohibits programming which &quot;sanctions, promotes or glamorizes violence.&quot;  The children's programming rules are generally content-oriented, as in the prohibition in s. 2.6 of &quot;realistic scenes of violence which create the impression that violence is the preferred way.&quot;  Similarly, violence which &quot;sanctions, promotes or glamorizes&quot; women, members of specific groups, or animals is barred. By their very terms, these provisions do not ban non-expressive violence, but target---and intend to target<sup><a href="#seventy2">72</a></sup>---violence which conveys particular meanings or impressions. Thus, the Code may be seen as infringing s. 2(b) of the <cite>Charter</cite>.
<p>
Some arguments may be raised against finding a s. 2(b) infringement, however. First, &quot;gratuitous&quot; or &quot;glamorized&quot; violence could be seen as conveying nothing in particular, or at least nothing that could not be expressed in other ways. As was stated above, however, the Code's provisions actually define the prohibited violence by reference to the meaning conveyed by particular representations of violence. Furthermore, as the Supreme Court suggested in <cite>Ford v. Quebec (A.-G.)</cite>, one's choice of form in expressing something---in this case, one's use of violent imagery---may be intimately connected to the meaning one wishes to convey, just as a statement delivered angrily conveys a different meaning than a statement delivered in a calm voice:
<blockquote>
[T]here cannot be true freedom of expression by means of language if one is prohibited from using the language of one's choice. Language is not merely a means or medium of expression; it colours the content and meaning of expression.<sup><a href="#seventy3">73</a></sup>
</blockquote>
It might also be argued that violent expression may be regulated in a way that is consistent with the <cite>Charter</cite> given the dicta in <cite>Irwin Toy</cite>: &quot;[V]iolence as a form of expression receives
no . . .  protection.&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy4">74</a></sup> But a portrayal or recording of violence is clearly an expressive representation of violence, and not a violent act <i>per se</i>.
<p>
More significant is the objection that the <cite>Charter</cite> guarantee of freedom of expression should apply to individuals, not to the corporations that operate broadcasting services. Section 2 states: &quot;<i>Everyone</i> has the following fundamental freedoms . . . &quot;<sup><a href="#seventy5">75</a></sup> Does this language limit the protection to individuals, thus allowing the government to regulate business without being lost in a thicket of <cite>Charter</cite> challenges?  On the other hand, would s. 2(b) not create a &quot;hollow right&quot; if its guarantee of &quot;freedom of the press and other media of communication&quot; could not be invoked by the corporate bodies that constitute the press and other media bodies?<sup><a href="#seventy6">76</a></sup>
<p>
Although the Supreme Court is still developing its doctrine on application of the <cite>Charter</cite> to corporations, so far it has been willing to permit corporations to advance s. 2(b) arguments; for example, it allowed the Edmonton Journal to challenge the constitutionality of an Alberta law restraining publication of the details of divorce or separation proceedings.<sup><a href="#seventy7">77</a></sup> In the absence of a criminal charge,<sup><a href="#seventy8">78</a></sup> the Court is unwilling to allow corporations to take advantage of <cite>Charter</cite> provisions that they cannot enjoy, such as the s. 7 right to security of the person or the s. 13 right against self-incrimination.<sup><a href="#seventy9">79</a></sup> Corporations are capable of expression,
however---indeed, they are the primary vehicle of expression in the broadcast media---and so ought to have recourse to the freedom of expression guarantee. While corporate expression may have less value than individual expression, the place to resolve that issue is surely in s. 1.
<p>
More generally, laws aimed at broadcasters will necessarily affect those individuals who wish to use broadcasting networks to convey meaning, thus strengthening a corporate claim of standing.<sup><a href="#eighty">80</a></sup> Moreover, as one commentator has observed, the courts have &quot;used their discretion to grant standing to corporations when the issues are regarded as significantly important to the development of constitutional jurisprudence.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty1">81</a></sup>
<p>
In short, both policy and jurisprudence support a finding that the Code infringes the s. 2(b) rights of both broadcasting corporations and the individuals using the networks to communicate.<sup><a href="#eighty2">82</a></sup> It is worth noting that both the CRTC and the Standing Committee on Communications and Culture have acknowledged that, if content regulations of televised violence were imposed by the government, the <cite>Charter</cite> might be infringed. For instance, the Committee's report states:
<blockquote>
The Committee recognizes that legislative action taken by Parliament or regulatory measures imposed by the CRTC to control violence on television would clearly infringe the freedom of expression. The debatable question arising from this scenario is whether such intrusions could be allowed under section 1 of the <cite>Charter</cite>.<sup><a href="#eighty3">83</a></sup>
</blockquote>
(C)   IS THE CODE PRESCRIBED BY LAW?
<p>
The <cite>Charter</cite>'s guarantee of freedom of expression is not limitless; the right may be infringed &quot;<i>only</i> . . .  [by] such limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty4">84</a></sup> The first question to consider, then, is whether the Code constitutes limits that are prescribed by law. Discussion of this question assumes that the Code may be treated as a
CRTC regulation, since compliance with the Code is a CRTC licence requirement. 
<p>
The &quot;prescribed by law&quot; test poses two questions in this case. First, is there a clear, defined limit to the CRTC's discretion? Second, are the provisions of the Code impermissibly vague?<sup><a href="#eighty5">85</a></sup> It seems likely that the Code would pass both branches of the test. First, the CRTC is not given unfettered discretion to regulate content; in the context of television violence, it acts pursuant to the <cite>Broadcasting Act</cite>'s declaration that &quot;the programming originated by broadcasting undertakings should be of high standard.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty6">86</a></sup> Thus, its regulatory powers are subject to an &quot;intelligible standard.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty7">87</a></sup>
<p>
Furthermore, the Code itself narrows and clarifies the range of the CRTC's discretion, at least in the field of television violence. In <cite>Ontario Film &amp; Video Appreciation Society v. Ontario (Board of Censors)</cite>, the Ontario Court of Appeal invalidated a statute permitting film censorship, partly on the grounds that the film board's censorship criteria were non-binding and thus lacked the force of law.<sup><a href="#eighty8">88</a></sup> It was argued above that despite the CAB's voluntary imposition of the Code, the
Code's provisions should be treated in the same way as CRTC regulations, particularly since they ultimately constitute an enforceable licence requirement. If this is so, then the Code has the force of law and is binding. It therefore provides a definite regulatory constraint, limiting the CRTC's discretion and ensuring that broadcasters know the scope of the regulations.
<p>
Second, while the Act's &quot;high standard&quot; provision considered alone could conceivably be challenged for vagueness, the Code's regulations, as clarifications of the high standard requirement with respect to television violence, are sufficiently intelligible to avoid a claim of vagueness. In <cite>Irwin Toy</cite>, the Court held that
the Quebec statute prohibiting commercial broadcasting aimed at children was prescribed by law partly because the statute provided factors for the government to take into account when deciding whether to apply the law.<sup><a href="#eighty9">89</a></sup> Similarly, the Code gives broadcasters and regulators a more precise idea of what will constitute impermissible violence. Thus, the Code ought to pass a &quot;prescribed by law&quot;  test.<sup><a href="#ninety">90</a></sup>
<p>
(D)   IS THE CODE A REASONABLE LIMIT DEMONSTRABLY JUSTIFIED?
<p>
Once a court finds an infringement of the s. 2(b) right to freedom of expression, s. 1 requires the court to consider whether the regulation is a reasonable and justified limit on the freedom. It is submitted that the Code would likely survive this balancing test, although this article will offer a number of objections to such a ruling.
<p>
As part of its balancing philosophy, the court does not treat all infringements as if they were uniformly serious. Instead, the court has held that &quot;not all expression is equally worthy of protection. Nor are all infringements of free expression equally serious.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety1">91</a></sup> One must ask whether the &quot;nature of the expression&quot; lies &quot;at, or even near, the core of the guarantee of freedom of expression.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety2">92</a></sup>
<p>
The court has identified three bases for the constitutional protection of freedom of expression: &quot;[T]he pursuit of truth, participation in the community, or individual self-fulfilment and human flourishing.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety3">93</a></sup> Given these justifications, &quot;gratuitous violence&quot; in commonplace commercial programming is arguably quite far from the core of freedom of expression; hence, the value of the expression would lose weight when balanced with countervailing factors under s. 1.
<p>
Furthermore, a court may assume about most television programming what Sopinka J. said about pornography in the <cite>Butler</cite><sup><a href="#ninety4">94</a></sup> decision: that &quot;the targeted material
is expression which is motivated, in the overwhelming majority of cases, by economic profit.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety5">95</a></sup> Restrictions on such expression, said Sopinka J., quoting the decision in <cite>Rocket</cite>,<sup><a href="#ninety6">96</a></sup> may be &quot;easier to justify than other infringements.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety7">97</a></sup> Thus, it would be easier to regulate violent programming if it is viewed as having primarily a profit-seeking function, rather than an expressive purpose.
<p>
But it may be argued that artistic expression generally, even when it is motivated in part by a desire for profit, is an intimate part of individual self-fulfillment, for both creator and audience. In <cite>Butler</cite>, the Court emphasized the importance of making an exception in the obscenity law for works with &quot;scientific, artistic
or literary merit,&quot; adding that &quot;[t]he existence of an accompanying economic motive does not, of itself, deprive a work of significance as an example of individual artistic or self-fulfilment.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety8">98</a></sup> 
<p>
Although most programs involving televised violence undoubtedly are aired to generate ratings and attract advertisers, they may nonetheless also constitute an attempt at artistic and personal expression by their creator or creators.<sup><a href="#ninety9">99</a></sup> To the extent that these programs represent valuable artistic
expression, they may also serve the <i>audience's</i> desire to participate in a community of viewers and to find self-fulfillment through the experience of art. Hence, televised violence may still be defended as speech rooted in core expressive values. Further, where the violence relates to news and public affairs programming, the expression would be considerably more important, given its relationship to the pursuit of truth.
<p>
Having established how the courts may view the relative importance of the expression infringed by the Code, one can move on to a s. 1 analysis of the Code, using as a framework the test established by <cite>R. v. Oakes</cite>.<sup><a href="#onehundred">100</a></sup>
<p>
(E)   DOES THE LEGISLATION ADDRESS A PRESSING AND SUBSTANTIAL CONCERN?
<p>
Under the <cite>Oakes</cite> test, the legislative objective must &quot;relate to concerns which are pressing and substantial in a free and democratic society before it can be characterized as sufficiently important&quot; to outweigh an infringement of a particular <cite>Charter</cite> guarantee.<sup><a href="#one01">101</a></sup> In this case, the concerns must be those of the administrative body enforcing the Code---the CRTC. 
<p>
As recounted above, the Commission has not asserted that the most dangerous but least likely consequences of televised violence---namely, a general increase in acts of violence---are the pressing and substantial concern addressed by the Code, despite the suggestion by the Chairman of the CRTC that censorship concerns ought to take a back seat to the &quot;medical problem&quot;<sup><a href="#one02">102</a></sup> of television violence. Instead, the CRTC has emphasized &quot;the link between massive, gratuitous TV violence and desensitization of children, leading to greater tolerance for real-life violence, emotional problems, school-yard bullying, and learning problems.&quot;<sup><a href="#one03">103</a></sup> These problems may be considerably more abstract and less indicative of a state of emergency than actual acts of violence, but they seem sufficiently concrete to warrant the court's agreement that they present a pressing and substantial problem for the government. 
<p>
The Supreme Court has indicated its unwillingness to second-guess the government's evaluation of conflicting scientific opinions.<sup><a href="#one04">104</a></sup> Thus, it is likely that the Court would accept the CRTC's assertion that there is a pressing and substantial concern addressed by the Code. Even though the possible social consequences of television violence put forward by the CRTC, such as an increase in the tolerance of violence, are much less pressing than the health concern posed by a fear of imitative violence, the threshold for
substantial concern may be lower because the objective of the Code is to protect children. In <cite>Irwin Toy</cite>, which dealt with commercial rather than artistic expression, the Court's &quot;pressing and substantial concern&quot; analysis took into account:
<blockquote>
. . . the particular susceptibility of young children to media manipulation, their inability to differentiate between reality and fiction . . .  and the secondary effects of exterior influences on the family and parental authority.<sup><a href="#one05">105</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Even a libertarian approach to regulation may accept the need for greater strictures where children are concerned:
<blockquote>
We are not speaking of children, or of young persons below the age which the law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood. Those who are still in a state to require being taken care of by others, must be protected against their own actions as well as against external injury.<sup><a href="#one06">106</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Clearly, then, the Code could pass the first branch of the <cite>Oakes</cite> test, given current &quot;pressing and substantial concern&quot; jurisprudence. As Professor Hogg has noted, the general practice of the Supreme Court indicates that &quot;[i]t has been easy to persuade the Court that, when the Parliament or Legislature acts in derogation of individual rights, it is doing so to further values that are . . .  pressing and substantial . . .&quot;<sup><a href="#one07">107</a></sup>
<p>
Typically, then, the courts will be quite deferential when the government purports to have pressing concerns. Nevertheless, in two important s. 2(b) cases which involved a dispute over the social consequences of the expression in question, the court showed somewhat less deference than it usually does. Rather than simply list the government's research and conclusions, the court displayed some desire to satisfy itself that the evidence genuinely indicated a pressing and substantial concern.<sup><a href="#one08">108</a></sup>
<p>
I would suggest that this more searching approach is the best way to apply the pressing and substantial concern test, in freedom of expression cases and in other <cite>Charter</cite> litigation. The very act of granting supremacy to certain rights by enshrining them in a charter indicates that they are so highly valued that the Canadian people wish to make sure that government cannot easily infringe them. Moreover, since it is the state's conduct in infringing a <cite>Charter</cite> right that is at issue in a <cite>Charter</cite> challenge, the state's claims in justification of its actions should be viewed with skepticism. Therefore, the courts should be less deferential to the government's claims in <cite>Charter</cite> challenges than they are in other actions.<sup><a href="#one09">109</a></sup>
<p>
Given the relatively tenuous nature of the claim of a direct causal link between televised violence and real violence or other substantial dangers, the Code presents an opportunity for the court to suggest that a reasonable evidentiary standard indicating a pressing and substantial concern simply has not been met. Recall that despite the CRTC's confidence in its claims, the Standing Committee on Communications and Culture was less certain:
<blockquote>
[I]f a higher level of government action should subsequently be required, it seems to the Committee that the government would then need more Canadian evidence than presently exists.<sup><a href="one10">110</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Still, as long as the deference currently paid to Parliament by the courts continues, the government would be unlikely to face any serious difficulty meeting the &quot;pressing and substantial concern&quot; test.
<p>
Another issue that may be examined under the rubric of &quot;pressing and substantial concern&quot; is whether the medium itself has an influence on the importance of the government's content-specific regulation. Does television have inherent qualities or dangers that make the government's goal more pressing or substantial? Certainly the degree of intrusiveness of the CRTC generally, and the intrusiveness of the Code particularly, suggest that the government is more willing to control expression in the broadcast media than in the print media. A brief look at common rationales for broadcast regulation shows that the courts are, in fact, likely to allow more
infringement of freedom of expression in the interest of regulating this medium. It is also clear, however, that these rationales constitute questionable bases for judgment.
<p>
One common rationale for stricter scrutiny of broadcast content is codified in the <cite>Broadcasting Act.</cite><sup><a href="#one11">111</a></sup> The Act declares: &quot;[T]he Canadian broadcasting system . . .  makes use of radio frequencies that are public property . . .&quot;<sup><a href="#one12">112</a></sup> In one of the few post-<cite>Charter</cite> broadcasting cases, <cite>Re N.B. Broadcasting Co. and CRTC</cite>, the Federal Court of Appeal held that a regulation restricting ownership of broadcast licenses by daily newspapers did not violate s. 2(b) of the <cite>Charter</cite>. Using the Act's public property declaration as the basis for his ruling,
Thurlow C.J wrote: &quot;[The <cite>Charter</cite>] gives no right to anyone to use the radio frequencies which, before the enactment of the Charter, had been declared by Parliament to be and had become public property
and subject to the licensing and other provisions of the <cite>Broadcasting Act</cite>.&quot;<sup><a href="#one13">113</a></sup> The Federal Court, Trial Division <i>has</i> held that the CRTC cannot act as a &quot;censor of the contents of any individual programme.&quot;<sup><a href="#one14">114</a></sup> However, this appears simply to mean that the Commission's punitive power is limited to the draconian step of altering a broadcaster's licence status, as opposed to interfering in individual programming questions. Therefore, the courts might still use the public property argument to uphold the need to police the airwaves for violence. 
<p>
On the other hand, it may be that a public property argument is better suited to cases such as <cite>N.B. Broadcasting</cite> which involve issues of access rather than content regulation. In United States jurisprudence, the comparable case is <cite>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC</cite>, in which the court used the public property argument to uphold the Fairness Doctrine, requiring broadcasters to present opposing points of view on controversial public issues.<sup><a href="#one15">115</a></sup> In a later critique of <cite>Red Lion</cite>, Douglas J. defined the limit of this argument: &quot;[P]arks are also in the public domain. Yet people who speak there do not come under Government censorship.&quot;<sup><a href="#one16">116</a></sup> Thus, while the public property rationale will surely have an influence in Canada given its presence in the Act, the courts' application of the rationale could be limited to issues of access, not content regulation.
<p>
A related argument is that the scarcity of the broadcast spectrum---that is, the fact that there is a finite limit on the
number of available broadcast channels---may make the government's regulatory purposes more pressing.<sup><a href="#one17">117</a></sup> This rationale has been the subject of heated criticism, on the grounds that the availability of channels has climbed sharply in recent years and that the appearance of scarcity is artificial, based on the high demand caused by awarding licences at a low cost that does not reflect possible revenues.<sup><a href="#one18">118</a></sup> In any case, the same caveats apply to the spectrum scarcity rationale as to the public property rationale: it may justify ensuring increased access to the media, but it does not necessarily justify content regulation.
<p>
Finally, there is the argument that television is a uniquely powerful and pervasive medium, and hence <i>prima facie</i> presents a more compelling need for regulation.<sup><a href="#one19">119</a></sup> Since children are the target of at least some of the Code's provisions, as well as being the focus of the CRTC's justifications, courts may well adopt this rationale in finding a more pressing and substantial need to regulate broadcast media.<sup><a href="#one20">120</a></sup>
<p>
To sum up, courts are likely to find that the purpose of the Code is pressing and substantial. This finding is likely to be grounded in the fact that children are the target of the government's justification, and in the public property declaration in the <cite>Broadcasting Act</cite>. But both the inconclusive scientific evidence regarding the effects of television violence, and the shaky rationales for strict regulation of the broadcast media <i>qua</i> media, suggest that such a decision would not be without its problems.<sup><a href="#one21">121</a></sup>
<p>
(F)   IS THERE A RATIONAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT'S PURPOSE AND THE CODE'S PROVISIONS?
<p>
The second part of the <cite>Oakes</cite> test requires an examination of whether the Code's provisions are &quot;rationally connected to the objective&quot; of the government.<sup><a href="#one22">122</a></sup> The regulation must be designed to meet the government's purported pressing and substantial concern, and it cannot be &quot;arbitrary, unfair, or based on irrational considerations.&quot;<sup><a href="#one23">123</a></sup> 
<p>
If one accepts the validity of the government's assessment of the social science research, then the children's programming section of the Code, which directs broadcasters not to depict too much violence or send the wrong message about violence in programs aimed at children under 12 years old,<sup><a href="#one24">124</a></sup> seems rationally connected to the objective of protecting children from harm. The scheduling and warning systems, inasmuch as they aid parents in regulating their children's viewing, also appear to meet the rational connection test. 
<p>
Since many children typically stay up to watch programs scheduled after the watershed point, a court might also accept the Code's general prohibitions against gratuitous violence and violence directed at certain groups or at animals. Less of a rational connection applies here, however, since such programs may be intended for adults and hence lie beyond the scope of the CRTC's justifications for regulating televised violence, which focus primarily on harm to children.
<p>
News and public affairs programming is unquestionably directed at adults, and mostly viewed by adults; hence, if the Code's regulatory cautions regarding such programming are found to infringe s. 2(b), it would be difficult to find a rational connection between the provisions and the goals of the Code, since few children are likely to watch news programs and adults are unlikely to be harmed by watching them. A provision aimed at regulating news  programming might therefore be viewed as not having been &quot;carefully designed to achieve the objective in question.&quot;<sup><a href="#one25">125</a></sup>
<p>
On the whole, then, most of the Code would likely meet the rational connection test as it is usually applied. But is this the best test?  As suggested above, where a law is challenged on the grounds that it violates the <cite>Charter</cite>, a more searching examination of the government's reasoning may be appropriate. A preferable test in this context might be one set out in dissent by McLachlin J. in <cite>Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor</cite>:
<blockquote>
Rational connection must be viewed, not only from the perspective of the intention of the legislators, but from the perspective of whether in fact the law is likely to accomplish its objectives. Latitude must be accorded to the legislators, but where it appears that the law is unlikely to achieve the ends . . .  it cannot be said to be rationally connected to those objectives.<sup><a href="#one26">126</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Under such a test, the chances of showing a rational connection would drop considerably. Given the various environmental factors faced by television viewers, it is unlikely that reducing televised violence would achieve much reduction of actual violence or violent tendencies among viewers, who absorb violent messages in any number of ways. Previous studies have therefore focused more on the ease of regulating televised violence than on the effectiveness of doing so:
<blockquote>
We believe that, while increased exploitation and depiction of violence in the media is only one of the many social factors contributing to crime, it is the largest single variable most amenable to rectification.<sup><a href="#one27">127</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Furthermore, since warnings are usually only broadcast at the beginning of a show or at periodic intervals thereafter, viewers are quite likely to miss them altogether, thus rendering the warning requirement ineffective. The availability of the same material in other media, and the possibility of children videotaping programs aired at later hours, also underscore the Code's potential ineffectiveness. As one researcher noted:
<blockquote>
The matter [of regulating televised violence] gets even more complicated when it is realized that, partially at least, open network television may be (and in some areas already has been) replaced by a system enabling consumers to determine their own programing [<i>sic</i>].<sup><a href="#one28">128</a></sup>
</blockquote>
As long as the current, generally deferential rational connection test is applied, however, most of the Code should pass this test. 
<p>
(G)   DOES THE CODE IMPAIR EXPRESSION AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE?
<p>
<cite>Oakes</cite> states that the Code should &quot;impair `as little as possible' the right or freedom in question.&quot;<sup><a href="#one29">129</a></sup> Generally, the courts have ruled that the government need only show a &quot;reasonable basis, on the basis of the evidence tendered, for concluding&quot; that the regulation &quot;impair[s] freedom of expression as little as possible given the government's pressing and substantial objective.&quot;<sup><a href="#one30">130</a></sup> As with the rational connection branch, most of the Code's provisions would likely pass such a test, since they bar only limited and extreme incidents of televised violence, and allow adults to continue watching most programming, with the aid of the viewer advisory system. 
<p>
One argument may be raised against the Code under this branch, however. If the Code is overbroad---if by its terms it would restrict more expression than was its intent---it may fail the minimal impairment test.<sup><a href="#one31">131</a></sup> The vagueness of the terms involved here may make the Code overbroad. Violence which is incidental but mild or stylized (a moment of slapstick violence on a sitcom, for example) may be beyond the intended scope of the Code but nonetheless covered by s. 1.1. And news broadcasts may effectively &quot;glamorize&quot; violence, also in violation of s. 1 of the Code---by showing victorious, `unpunished' troops in battle, for instance. The difficulty of determining which televised violence ought to be barred means the regulations may simply sweep up reasonable programs in their path, thus violating this branch of the <cite>Oakes</cite> test. The Standing Committee on Communications and Culture acknowledged this problem, declaring that &quot;the broad language and wide discretion contained in [voluntary] codes would be unacceptable in legislation.&quot;<sup><a href="#one32">132</a></sup>
<p>
(H) IS THERE PROPORTIONALITY BETWEEN THE OBJECTIVE OF THE MEASURE AND ITS EFFECTS?
<p>
The final branch of the s. 1 test seeks to ensure that the benefit conferred by the infringement is significant in relation to the infringed <cite>Charter</cite> right.<sup><a href="#one33">133</a></sup> Whether the Code meets this part of the test depends on the manner in which the judge seeks to effect a balance. In <cite>Keegstra</cite>, Dickson C.J.C., speaking for the Court, considered narrowly &quot;[t]he expressive activity at which this provision aim[ed].&quot;<sup><a href="#one34">134</a></sup> In contrast, McLachlin J.'s dissent gave a greater weight to freedom of expression values by considering all the possible penumbral effects that the hate propaganda provision <i>might</i> have on free speech, not just the effects of the particular infringement caused by the provision.<sup><a href="#one35">135</a></sup>
<p>
If one follows the majority's reasoning in this case, clearly the Code constitutes a relatively minor infringement, although the benefit conferred may also be small. On the other hand, following McLachlin J., the infringement here can be seen as a potentially broad and sweeping regulation of expressive content that would threaten both journalistic and artistic expression, striking at &quot;viewpoints in widely diverse domains, whether artistic, social or political.&quot;<sup><a href="#one36">136</a></sup> In either case, the courts should keep in mind that the crux of a strong proportionality test should be whether any benefits are actually received in exchange for the infringement of a <cite>Charter</cite> right. This view of the test paraphrases Krattenmaker &amp; Powe:
<blockquote>
The nature of the first amendment dictates that the true questions are whether these harms [that the provision is aimed at alleviating] are tangible, concrete, and avoidable only by censorship.<sup><a href="#one37">137</a></sup>
</blockquote>
In other words, a court should use this branch of the test to make sure that the government is acting in response to a real problem, and that the government's solution is effective enough to justify the draconian step of infringing a <cite>Charter</cite> right.
<p>
On balance, a court that finds that the Code meets the other branches of the <cite>Oakes</cite> test is unlikely to strike down the regulation here, since at least a <i>prima facie</i> case can be made for proportionality. Still, it is clear that a great deal of expression (albeit much of it may be unwanted) has been curtailed, in exchange for a benefit that is potentially quite small.
<p>
(I)   SUMMARY
<p>
Given the court's deference to the government on matters of social science research and other evidence leading to policy conclusions, it seems certain that a fairly wide range of content regulations for broadcast programs would pass constitutional muster, at least as long as the provision is aimed at children. However, an appropriate respect for the <cite>Charter</cite> dictates that, where a bedrock right is at stake, the court should adopt a more searching
approach, questioning whether a pressing and substantial purpose really exists, and scrutinizing the real benefit that is likely to be gained from the infringement. Under such an analysis, given the absence of evidence that the Code would have any significant effect in reaching its desired goals, the provisions that regulate general content or that affect news programming would not constitute a justifiable infringement of s. 2(b) of the <cite>Charter</cite>.
<p>
<h3>V. The Code's Implications</h3>

If the Code is considered constitutional, there are a number of implications for broadcasters in terms of its applications and in terms of other content regulations.
<p>
First, of course, if the CRTC can effectively put the threat of more onerous legislation---or of licence non-renewal and other financial nightmares---behind its &quot;wooing&quot; without bringing the resulting self-regulation into the sphere of government action, then it may be able to coax broadcasters to engage in further self-censorship. Viewers who despair at the quality of modern television programming might wish for further changes in broadcasters' standards; nonetheless, a coercive approach to reforming television programming is misguided. Such an approach gives the CRTC substantial leeway to regulate content by so-called `persuasion,' while leaving itself outside the scope of administrative or <cite>Charter</cite> review. 
<p>
On this score, one should note the existence of another CAB programming code, the Sex-Role Portrayal Code for Television and Radio Programming. This code, which requires broadcasters to &quot;advance the awareness of, and sensitivity to, the problems related to the negative or inequitable sex-role portrayal of persons,&quot; was promulgated and revised at the direction of the CRTC.<sup><a href="#one38">138</a></sup>
<p>
Extensions of the Code dealing with violence could also follow. The current Code simply limits certain kinds of violence. Since the CRTC has emphasized the importance of the amount of violence one watches, future &quot;self-regulation&quot; could seek to impose quotas on the amount of violence that may be shown by a broadcaster, or to
require that a given percentage of programming meet a &quot;responsibility&quot; standard---that is, some programs would have to advance appropriate moral lessons or dissuade certain behaviour (for example, violence). Particularly where children are concerned, and possibly beyond, the CRTC could urge such `self-regulation' on the
grounds of protecting &quot;public health&quot; or morals.<sup><a href="#one39">139</a></sup>
<p>
More broadly, the reasoning that could support the Code could also support regulation of other forms of televised material. One example may be &quot;indecent&quot; language---that is, the use of shocking or profane language, at least where it may catch the attention of children. In <cite>FCC v. Pacifica Foundation</cite>, a case concerning the daytime radio broadcast of a monologue by comic George Carlin which contained repeated profanities, the United States Supreme Court held that such language could be regulated during the daytime hours, even though the radio program in question had been aimed at adults.<sup><a href="#one40">140</a></sup> The Court held that the pervasive nature of the broadcast media, and the fact that children can gain easy access to television (unlike literature, which requires that its consumers have reading skills), justified the intrusion on the First Amendment. 
<p>
Similarly, Canadian regulatory authorities could mount an effort to regulate profane or obscene lanaguage on television, arguing that a steady diet of such language has harmful effects; at the least, an early desensitization to unruly behaviour might result. Regulations aimed at such language would thus require substantial rescheduling of
programs, and perhaps an outright ban on &quot;gratuitous&quot; offensive language where it is found not to serve any artistic purpose.
<p>
It is interesting to note that <cite>Pacifica</cite> may serve as the basis for content regulation of televised violence in the United States, where in the past year a number of members of Congress have introduced bills attempting to curtail violence on American networks.<sup><a href="#one41">141</a></sup> The United States Attorney General, Janet Reno, said in testimony before the U.S. Senate last year that she felt the reasoning in <cite>Pacifica</cite> could be applied to proposed U.S. legislation regulating TV violence.<sup><a href="#one42">142</a></sup> Her position has met with opposition from the American Civil Liberties Union, which suggested, in a letter signed by several dozen First Amendment scholars, &quot;They [the pending bills] involve a content and viewpoint bias that cannot be reconciled with the Constitution . . . They are vague and overbroad . . .  Moreover, violent speech does not fit into the narrow and limited exception created by the Supreme Court for `indecent' speech when broadcast on radio or television.&quot;<sup><a href="#one43">143</a></sup>
<p>
Finally, depending on the results of scientific studies, the government could seek to apply similar violence restrictions to programming aimed more directly at adults. While adults have the reasoning power that children are presumed to lack, they may be subject to many of the same dangers, such as desensitization or increased aggression. CRTC Chairman Spicer has disavowed any intention of curtailing viewing choices for adults, telling panelists in a televised discussion, &quot;The state has no business whatever telling adults what to watch . . .  We should not keep bringing the debate back to adults. They have nothing to do with this debate. They should see whatever they want.&quot;<sup><a href="#one44">144</a></sup>
<p>
Nevertheless, the same reasoning applies. Again, an analogy with <cite>Butler</cite> suggests itself. That the consumers of pornography are mature and freely consenting adults makes no difference to the validity of the regulation if a real risk of harm is involved, and one could expect the voluntariness and maturity of an audience viewing televised violence to make no difference either. What matters is that Parliament is &quot;entitled to have a `reasoned apprehension of harm' resulting from the desensitization of individuals . . .&quot;<sup><a href="#one45">145</a></sup> If the evidence of harmful effects on adults were sufficiently convincing, future legislators or regulators might step in where today's officials will not. 
<p>
It should also be frankly noted that another possible result of the Code is that, save for the addition of program ratings and advisories, little will change. Although the Code could be strictly administered, CAB officials say they do not believe any programs currently airing on private networks would qualify as gratuitous; rather, the gratuitous violence provision is said to codify existing programming standards.<sup><a href="#one46">146</a></sup> Nevertheless, this may change as the Code is administered, or if social pressure to reduce violence on television
mounts.
<p>
<h3>VI. Violence, Values, and Republican Theory</h3>

Ultimately, the regulation of televised violence amounts to much more than an effort to solve a &quot;medical problem.&quot;  Note Mr. Spicer's suggestion that one motivation for the CRTC's actions in urging private regulation is the fear of &quot;desensitizing [children] to cruelty,&quot; a concern which addresses, not a fear of positive violent acts by children, but a more generalized fear of moral indifference. The Code also appears to suggest that there are proper and improper lessons to be derived from televised violence; thus, one should not learn that violence is the &quot;preferred way . . .  to resolve conflict between individuals,&quot; though some viewers may hold that this is true in some situations, or may watch such programs purely for their metaphorical value.<sup><a href="#one47">147</a></sup>
<p>
In short, I suggest that these regulations advance an orthodoxy of values, essentially putting forward an approved social viewpoint about violence and its portrayal. As laudable as the goal of encouraging antipathy to violence may be, one may share the goal while believing it ought to be achieved without content regulation.
<p>
Government regulation of expression, if it is the result of a desire to advance a particular moral viewpoint and censor those who would express themselves in an `immoral' fashion---in this case, through the use of gratuitously violent programming---would conflict with the general liberal view that speech rights, among other rights, exist to protect individuals against the state. Such regulation could, however, mesh with modern republican theory. Republican theory argues that regulation which is shaped by people's true preferences, and which encourages these preferences to flourish, may constitute an acceptable communitarian limitation on choice. Under this approach, a laissez-faire attitude toward current programming may reinforce a set of preferences that are themselves  unreasonable, since people's tastes may be the result of conditions such as a paucity of quality programming, or social and educational inequality. Thus, in the case of television violence, regulation reflects a more deliberative
realization of our deeper preference for thoughtful and unharmful programs, and allows us to enforce on the television screen a vision of what we think our tastes <i>should</i> be, although, for various reasons, they are often quite different.<sup><a href="#one48">148</a></sup>
<p>
In two recent books, Cass Sunstein has made a republican argument for a &quot;New Deal for speech,&quot; a new approach to speech issues which would favour greater regulation.<sup><a href="#one49">149</a></sup> In his
view, speech and its regulation should be viewed as part of a system which is &quot;closely connected to the central constitutional goal of creating a deliberative democracy.&quot;<sup><a href="#one50">150</a></sup> Speech should <i>actively</i> promote democratic self-government. In the context of television, this means that broadcasters should provide quality and diversity in their programming.<sup><a href="#one51">151</a></sup> Consequently, a legal regime which allows broadcasters to compromise the goals of quality and diversity by awarding them absolute free speech may be inconsistent with (in Sunstein's case) the First Amendment;<sup><a href="#one52">152</a></sup> and laws which reinforce these goals and encourage the shaping of true public preferences will be constitutional, even though they may abridge or affect speech.<sup><a href="#one53">153</a></sup> 
<p>
Sunstein suggests that violent programming will have a harmful social effect, particularly when it is directed at
children.<sup><a href="#one54">154</a></sup> Such programming would clearly undermine quality standards, reflect false public preferences, and disserve Sunstein's conception of a speech system which reinforces the &quot;broader aspirations&quot;<sup><a href="#one55">155</a></sup> of a deliberative democratic polity. He notes with approval the efforts of various countries to stem the flow of blood on television.<sup><a href="#one56">156</a></sup> While he favours attacking the problem first from an &quot;incentive-based, market-oriented&quot; approach rather than a &quot;command-and-control&quot; approach,<sup><a href="#one57">157</a></sup> there can be little doubt that Sunstein would permit use of the stick if the carrot fails.<sup><a href="#one58">158</a></sup>
<p>
If the government is too ready to enforce choices about moral preferences, however, it runs the risk of engaging in
&quot;\thinspace`legal moralism' . . . a majority deciding what values should inform individual lives and then coercively imposing those values on minorities.&quot;<sup><a href="#one59">159</a></sup> Republican regulation of content may lead, not to more open or clearer thinking about violence, but to well-intentioned &quot;manipulation of the flow of information and opinion.&quot;<sup><a href="#one60">160</a></sup>
<p>
In fact, the individual's fear of subjection to another's preferences in matters such as speech or religion is what has driven and still motivates the free speech guarantee. As Douglas J. wrote:
<blockquote>
That fear [of government intrusion] was founded not only on the spectre of a lawless government but of government under the control of a faction that desired to foist its views of the common good on the people.<sup><a href="#one61">161</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Adopting this reasoning, one can see the <cite>Charter</cite> guarantee in s. 2(b) as one which places freedom of expression outside the web of state influence, save for those moments when some matter of genuine public urgency---a real emergency, and not simply an unpleasant social outcome---forces an intrusion. Shifting our preferences away from violence, like preventing &quot;dirt for dirt's sake&quot; in <cite>Butler</cite>,<sup><a href="#one62">162</a></sup> does not suffice; in order for the government to regulate televised violence, there must be a substantial danger.
<p>
<h3>VII. Conclusion</h3>

This article has argued that most of the Voluntary Code Regarding Violence in Television Programming, even if viewed as a government regulation, would likely survive a <cite>Charter</cite> challenge alleging a violation of freedom of expression; however, its survival depends largely on the courts' reliance on an outmoded view of broadcasting as a special medium that requires stricter content regulation than other media, and on their apparent view that the government deserves deference even when it has acted to infringe our most basic rights. Between the courts' willingness to control broadcasting strictly, and their deferential approach to the government, the CRTC's argument that television violence presents a substantial health problem is less likely to face the skeptical examination that it deserves.
<p>
As was stated in this article's introduction, our willingness in Canada to control the flow of content through the broadcast media appears to reflect a &quot;profound sense of ambivalence about Canada's mass media.&quot;<sup><a href="#one63">163</a></sup> Similarly, one writer (discussing general views of the broadcast media rather than a Canadian viewpoint) has noticed:
<blockquote>
. . . a certain psychological attitude toward the electronic media. Many people regard television, for instance, as being too powerful and influential to be allowed freedom from government control . . .  It may be that all of this is no deeper than the fear with which the medieval church and state viewed the technology of printing.<sup><a href="#one64">164</a></sup>
</blockquote>
It is incontestable that this medium, although barely out of its infancy, is influential. But fear of its powers does not
lead to careful consideration of the reasonableness of regulating what goes on the air. In the case of televised violence, the weak evidence showing the effects of television-watching <i>only</i> succeeds in supporting the Code's rigorous content regulations if it is further assumed that the medium carries risks substantially greater than those posed by other media.
<p>
Even if the medium has greater potential influence than other media, I would argue that its influence is not strong enough to warrant government pressure on broadcasters to convey particular values and shun others, praiseworthy as those values may be.<sup><a href="#one65">165</a></sup> Indeed, we should be particularly leery of these efforts, since they establish as regular procedure a government effort to achieve its ends in an extra-governmental manner, by using the threat of regulation to force broadcasters to codify rules that the CRTC might---or might not---be able to promulgate itself.
<p>
The free speech issues involved are not academic, neither in Canada nor anywhere else. In Canada, Parliament may yet decide to turn this &quot;voluntary&quot; code into law, or to pass a stricter code.<sup><a href="#one66">166</a></sup> In the United States, legislators warn, &quot;If the TV and cable industries have no
sense of shame, we must take it upon ourselves to stop licensing their violence-saturated programming.&quot;<sup><a href="#one67">167</a></sup> The possibility of regulation is also raised in a statement by the French communications minister in the fall of 1993, announcing that he will seek international regulations to reduce violence on television.<sup><a href="#one68">168</a></sup>
<p>
The evidence and arguments now mustered against televised violence only await their application to other content. Ithiel de Sola Pool observed, &quot;The new communication technologies have not inherited all the legal immunities that were won for the old.&quot;<sup><a href="#one69">169</a></sup> Sooner rather than
later, it is important that they do.

<li><a name="eighty2">Equally interesting is</a> the question whether the CBC has standing to allege a s. 2(b) infringement by the government, despite the fact that it is a Crown corporation. Since the CBC is not covered by the Code, the issue is outside the scope of this article. Those who are interested in the topic should note a recent case,
<cite>National Party of Canada v. CBC</cite> (1993), 13 Alta. L.R. (3d) 20 (S.C.), aff'd (1993), 13 Alta L.R. 29 (C.A.). In that case, both courts decided that the CBC's refusal to give the National Party a spot on a televised debate was a programming decision which was non-governmental. The logical consequence of this would seem to be that where the government intrudes on the CBC's independent exercise of its programming judgment, the CBC should have standing to challenge the infringement, especially since viewers' rights are implicated. This is a sensible result, since, as with the universities in <cite>McKinney</cite>, the CBC is acting in a role traditionally assumed by private actors---that of broadcaster.

Admittedly, both these cases involved the Criminal Code and not regulatory provisions. I would argue, however, that this distinction is more relevant to later stages of s. 1 review, such as the minimal impairment test, if it is relevant at all. This is because the &quot;pressing and substantial concern&quot; test focuses on whether a law is necessary, an issue which does not touch directly on whether the law is too harsh or overbroad. These concerns relate to proportionality, which is dealt with in subsequent stages of s. 1 review.

s. 3(1)(d)(ii) of the Act, which encourages the &quot;displaying [of] Canadian talent in entertainment programming,&quot; without dictating programming content.
