The Common Sense Legal Reforms Act 
H.R. -- 
 
Highlights: 
 
H.R.-- makes a number of legal reforms to, among other things, 
make sure that expert witness testimony is based on 
scientifically sound evidence, that product liability laws 
are uniformly applied, that abusive securities lawsuits are 
limited, and that opportunities for alternative dispute 
resolution are expanded. 
 
Background: 
 
Almost everyone agrees that America has become a litigious 
society: we sue each other too often and too easily. In the 
federal courts alone, the number of lawsuits filed each year 
has almost tripled in the last 30 years--from approximately 
90,000 in 1960 to more than 250,000 in 1990. As President 
Bush's Council on Competitiveness found, this dramatic 
growth in litigation carries high costs for the U.S. 
economy: manufactures withdraw products from the market, 
discontinue product research, reduce their workforces, and 
raise their prices. 
 
In addition to the sheer volume of lawsuits that filter 
through the legal system each year are the problems 
associated with frivolous suits. In many cases, defendants 
know that the suit would not stand on its own merits, but 
agree to settle out of court just to avoid the endless and 
expensive claim and appeal processes. Such responses merely 
perpetuate our propensity to sue. Legal experts point to a 
few straightforward reforms that can help stem abuse of the 
system. Promoting voluntary settlements instead of court 
trials, and encouraging meritorious claims while 
discouraging baseless suits and devious trial tactics are 
just some of these proposals. 
 
Provisions: 
 
"Loser Pays Rule" 
 
H.R. -- applies the so-called "loser pays rule" (in which the 
unsuccessful party in a suit pays the attorneys' fees of 
the prevailing party) to diversity cases filed in federal 
court. A diversity case involves citizens from different 
states. 
 
However, the bill limits the size of the coverage to the 
loser's own attorneys' fees costs (e.g., if the prevailing 
party spent $100 dollars defending himself and the 
unsuccessful party spent $50, then the unsuccessful party is 
only responsible for $50 of the prevailing party's court 
costs). Courts may also impose other limits on the award of 
attorneys' fees. 
 
Bill sponsors argue that the "loser pays rule" strongly 
discourages the filing of weak cases as well as 
encourages the pursuit of strong cases, since 
claimants can get their court costs reimbursed if they win. 
 
Honesty in Evidence 
 
The bill amends Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence 
regarding expert witness testimony to state that expert 
testimony is not admissible in a federal court (1) unless it 
is based on "scientifically valid reasoning" and (2) if the 
expert is paid a contingency fee (however, the bill allows 
the judge to waive this second prohibition). 
 
Bill sponsors argue that so-called experts too often base 
their opinions on "junk science" in order to justify absurd 
claims. 
 
Product Liability 
 
The legislation creates a uniform product liability law 
(covering state and federal actions) in three areas: 
punitive damages, joint and several liability, and 
fault-based liability for product sellers. 
 
For punitive damages, the bill requires that claimants 
establish by "clear and convincing evidence" that the harm 
they suffered was the direct result of malicious conduct. 
Under the measure, punitive damages are limited to three 
times the actual harm (i.e., the economic damages awarded). 
For claimants with little actual harm, awards of up to 
$250,000 could be awarded. 
 
H.R. -- also abolishes joint liability for non-economic losses 
(mental distress, pain and suffering, etc.) and holds 
defendants liable only for their proportion of the harm. 
Under current law, a defendant can be held responsible for 
the entire award, even if he is not completely responsible 
for all the harm done. For example, if a consumer sues the 
manufacturer, the buyer, the shipper and the merchant and 
only the merchant is solvent, the merchant becomes 
responsible for the total amount of damages awarded by the 
court--including the portions owed by the other parties. The 
solvent individual is then forced to recover the others' 
portions on his own. This legislation would make an 
individual party responsible only for the portion of damages 
directly attributable to it. 
 
Finally, the bill makes product sellers liable only for 
harms caused by their own negligence (e.g., altering or 
assembling a product or making false claims about the 
product). Product sellers would only be responsible for 
manufacturer errors when the manufacturer cannot be brought 
to court or lacks the funds to pay a settlement. 
 
Attorney Accountability 
 
H.R. -- expresses the sense of Congress that states should 
enact laws requiring attorneys practicing within their 
borders to disclose certain information to clients. 
Specifically, in contingency fee cases, states should make 
attorneys disclose (1) the actual duties performed for each 
client and (2) the precise number of hours actually spent 
performing these duties. 
 
The bill also amends Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure to restore the mandatory requirement that courts 
sanction attorneys for improper actions and frivolous 
arguments intended to harass, unnecessarily delay, and 
needlessly increase the cost of litigation. Sanctions are to 
be determined by the judge and may involve financial 
penalties, contempt orders, limits on discovery and other 
procedural penalties. Prior to December 1, 1993, federal 
courts were required to impose sanctions for violations of 
Rule 11. However, on that date the Federal Judicial 
Conference's recommendations to amend Rule 11 (making sanctions 
optional 
rather than mandatory) took effect since Congress did not 
act on the proposed rule change. 
 
In addition to reinstating the mandatory sanction, the bill 
requires, for the first time, that sanctioned attorneys 
compensate injured parties. 
 
Prior Notice 
 
At least 30 days before a plaintiff can bring a suit, he 
must transmit written notice to the defendant of the 
specific claims involved and the actual amount of damages 
sought. Proponents of the legislation argue that prior 
notice of a grievance provides an opportunity for both 
parties to resolve the dispute without going to court. 
 
Legislative Checklist 
 
This section of the bill is designed to limit needless and 
costly litigation resulting from poorly-drafted legislation. 
Frequently Congress fails to directly address basic issues 
that later result in court challenges. For example, during 
consideration of the most recent amendments to the Civil 
Rights Act, Congress failed to resolve the issue of 
retroactivity. Litigation dragged on for two years until the 
Supreme Court ruled that the law was not retroactive. Bill 
sponsors argue that this could have been avoided if Congress 
had been forced to take a decisive stand on the issue. 
 
The bill seeks to limit such situations by requiring that 
committee reports address the following issues: preemptive 
effect, retroactive effect, authorization for private suits 
and applicability to the federal government. 
 
Strike Lawsuits 
 
H.R. -- reforms federal securities law to limit so-called 
"strike" lawsuits--lawsuits filed by class action attorneys on 
behalf of shareholders whose once-attractive stock purchases 
have failed to live up to their expectations. Although these 
suits claim that the holding company misrepresented the 
healthiness of their stocks, many times the down-turn can 
only be blamed on market volatility. 
 
Bill sponsors argue that these cases usually involve highly 
speculative investments in the securities field (less than one 
percent involve truly fraudulent companies) and, it is the 
attorney, not the shareholder, that benefits from the suit. 
Since class action lawyers can make decisions that are not 
in the best interest of the clients without fear of reprisal 
and take a big chunk of the settlement off the top, shareholders are 
often 
exploited. Strike suits are money-makers for the lawyers, 
but such frivolous claims destroy jobs and hurt the economy. 
Instead of spending money on research and development, or hiring 
more employees, or reducing the cost of their products, companies 
end up spending big bucks on strike suit insurance and legal 
fees. High-technology, biotechnology and other growth companies 
are 
hardest hit because their stocks are naturally volatile. 
Small- and medium-sized companies 
alone have paid out nearly $500 million dollars during the last 
two years (settling a case is often times cheaper and quicker 
than defending in court). The problem is rapidly getting worse: 
in the last five years, the number of strike suits has tripled. 
 
To address these abuses, H.R. -- (1) provides a court-appointed 
trustee for plaintiffs (to make sure that lawyers act in the best 
interests of their clients), (2) guarantees plaintiffs full 
disclosure of key settlement terms (including a breakdown of how 
much is to go 
to them and how much to their lawyers to pay legal fees), 
(3) limits "professional plaintiffs" to five class-action 
lawsuits every three years (these individuals typically 
purchase one share of every stock on the New York Stock 
Exchange and wait for the stock to drop. They then work with 
the class action lawyer to initiate the class action and 
receive bonus payments for their cooperation.), (4) makes 
losing litigants responsible for the winner's costs, (5) 
prohibits application of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations (RICO) Act to securities cases, and (6) 
prohibits vague and open-ended complaints. In a key reform, 
the bill requires that claimants show they relied on 
intentionally misrepresented information or omissions of 
information in deciding to purchase their stock, and that 
their losses were not caused by bad luck in the stock 
market.

Agenda for Civil Justice Reform in America, A Report from 
the President's Council on Competitiveness, August 1991. 
 
 
 
Taking Back Our Streets Act, H.R. -- 
 
Highlights: 
 
H.R. -- embodies the Republican approach to fighting crime: 
making punishments severe enough to deter criminals from 
committing crimes, making sure that the criminal justice 
system is fair and impartial for all, and making sure that 
local law enforcement officials (who are on the streets 
every day), and not Washington bureaucrats direct the 
distribution of federal law enforcement funds. 
 
The bill sets mandatory sentences for crimes involving the 
use of firearms, authorizes $10.5 billion for state prison 
construction grants, establishes truth-in-sentencing 
guidelines, reforms the habeas corpus appeals process, 
allows police officers who in good faith seized 
incriminating evidence in violation of the ``exclusionary 
rule" to use the evidence in court, requires that convicted 
criminals make restitution to their victims, and authorizes 
$10 billion for local law enforcement spending. Finally, in 
addressing one of the most pressing problems in our country 
today, the bill streamlines the current alien deportation 
system, while still allowing convicted aliens the right to 
judicial review and appeal. 
 
Bill sponsors argue that this legislation strikes at the 
heart of our violent crime problem by deterring criminals 
from committing crimes in the first place, and making sure 
that if they do commit a crime, they serve the sentence they 
are given and are not able to abuse the appeals process. 
Supporters contend that this bill fixes a number of problems 
created by the recently-enacted omnibus crime bill, as well 
as serious problems left unaddressed by that legislation. 
Critics maintain that the measure concentrates too much on 
punishment and not enough on prevention; the way to stop 
crime, they argue, is not to keep filling our jails, but to 
keep at-risk youth from going there in the first place. 
 
Background: 
 
Crime in America: Putting the Debate in Context 
 
Statistics paint a grim picture, illustrating clearly that 
the U.S. has failed to get a handle on its growing crime 
problem. One expert has estimated that a 20 year old black 
male has a greater chance of being murdered on the streets 
than a soldier in World War II stood of dying in combat. 
According to the FBI, the rate of violent crime in the U.S. 
is worse than in any other western-developed country, with a 
murder occurring every 21 minutes, a rape every five 
minutes, a robbery every 46 seconds and an aggravated 
assault every 29 seconds. Violent crime or property crime 
victimizes one in four U.S. households. Every year, nearly 
five million people are victims of violent crime such as 
murder, rape, robbery or assault, and 19 million Americans 
are victims of property crimes such as arson or burglary. 
Juvenile crime has increased by 60 percent between 1981 and 
1990 (compared to an increase of five 
percent among adults) and the number of inmates convicted of drug 
offenses rose 14 percent from 1983 to 1989. On all fronts, the 
problem has reached epidemic proportions. 
 
This crime crisis is particularly severe among minorities 
and the poor. The U.S. homicide rate for black males 
between the ages of 15 and 24 is 283 times that of male 
homicide rates in 17 other nations. And homicide is now the 
leading cause of death for blacks aged 15 to 34. Poor 
households are victimized more often than upper income 
households. In 1992, households with incomes of less than 
$7,500 
experienced crime at a rate of 136.7 per 1,000 compared to the 
rate of 83.3 per 1,000 for households with incomes between 
$30,000 and $49,000. 
 
While the problem is severe, statistics illustrate that a 
small percentage of criminals commit the vast majority of 
violent crimes. Just seven percent of criminals commit 
two-thirds of all violent crime, including three fourths of 
rapes and robberies, and virtually all murders. A 1991 study 
done by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 
indicated that 471 armed criminals had a total of 3,088 
felony convictions--an average of 6.55 felonies each. To make 
matters worse, many of these criminals either are never 
caught, or, if found guilty, do not serve their entire 
prison sentence. Every year, over 60,000 criminals convicted 
of a violent crime never go to prison--for every 100 crimes 
reported only three criminals go to prison. The Bureau of 
Justice Statistics has found that only 45.4 percent of 
court-ordered confinement is served on average, and 51 
percent of violent offenders sent to prison are released in 
two years or less. These numbers are even more telling in 
light of the fact that at least 30 percent of the murders in 
this country are committed by people on probation, parole or 
bail. Faced with prison overcrowding, 17 states have begun 
emergency release programs. Overall, the risk of punishment 
has declined in the past 40 years while the annual number of 
serious crimes committed has skyrocketed. 
 
All this has led to public calls for "truth-in-sentencing" 
laws (requiring criminals to serve a significant percentage 
of their sentences without a chance of parole) and "three 
strikes, you're out" laws (requiring life in prison for 
recidivists convicted of their third violent felony). 
Opponents of strict sentencing laws like these argue that 
``locking people up" does not address the problem of why 
crimes are committed in the first place. Evidence suggests, 
however, that there is a strong correlation between increased 
incarceration and decreased crime rates: from 1990- 1991, 
states with the greatest increases in criminal incarceration 
rates experienced, on average, a 12.7 percent decrease in 
crime, while the 10 states with the weakest incarceration 
rates experienced an average 6.9 percent increase in crime. 
 
Recent Legislation 
 
Just a few weeks ago, President Clinton signed P.L. 
103-322, the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1994 after nearly one 
year of congressional hearings, mark-ups, floor votes, 
conference wranglings, a delayed recess, and weekend votes. 
Many members spoke out against the legislation, arguing that 
it did little to address the fundamental crime problem in 
our country. Relying on expensive "Great Society-esque" 
programs, the bill attempted to do what all other big 
government social programs have failed to do: make 
individuals responsible for their actions and instill a 
sense of right and wrong in those with a propensity to 
commit a crime. Criticism focused not only on what the bill 
contained, but what it lacked. Republicans argued that is 
should have included reform of the habeas corpus process 
(the process by which inmates challenge the 
constitutionality of their sentences), a good faith 
exemption for the exclusionary rule, tough language against 
sexual predators, more money for state prison construction, 
and stronger requirements that states enact 
truth-in-sentencing laws to be eligible for grant 
assistance. 
 
After a crazy weekend session at the end of August, the 
conference agreement was finally approved by the House 
235-195 (Roll Call #416). When all was said and done, the 
compromise authorized a total of $30 billion over six years, 
including $5.4 billion for prevention programs, $7.9 billion 
for new prison construction and $8.8 billion for new police 
officers. It also included the so-called "three strikes, 
you're out" provision, applied the death penalty to over 50 
new crimes, increased penalties 
for repeat federal sex offenders, and banned at least 150 
semiautomatic weapons. The final version did not include the 
controversial Racial Justice Act (which allows defendants to 
introduce in their defense statistical evidence that blacks 
receive death sentences more often than whites) or any reform of 
the habeas corpus process. 
 
In addition to passing the first omnibus crime bill in four 
years, the 103rd Congress also passed the Brady Bill, which 
established a five-day waiting period for the purchase of a 
handgun. The House approved that measure (H.R. 1025) on 
November 10, 1993 by a vote of 238-189. President Clinton 
signed it into law on November 30, 1993 as P.L. 103-159. 
Other smaller crime-related bills passed during this 
Congress include the National Child Protection Act of 1993 
(P.L. 103-209) which established criminal background checks 
for child care providers, and the International Parental 
Kidnapping Crime Act (P.L. 
103-173) which made it a federal crime for a parent to kidnap 
a child under the age of 16 years from his custodial parent and 
remove 
him from the United States. 
 
Provisions: 
 
Death Penalty Provisions (Title I) 
 
General Habeas Corpus Reform. The bill makes a number of 
revisions to federal and state habeas corpus processes (the 
process by which prisoners who have exhausted all direct 
appeals challenge the constitutionality of their sentences). 
Specifically, it places a one-year limitation on the filing of 
general federal habeas corpus appeals after all state remedies have 
been exhausted. State capital cases must be filed in a 
federal court within six months, and state capital prisoners 
who file a second or successive federal habeas appeal must receive 
a certificate of probable cause stating that their case has 
merit. Non-capital federal prisoners must file within two years. 
The bill also forces federal courts to consider federal 
habeas petitions within a certain time frame. 
 
In addition to placing a time limit on when appeals may be 
made, H.R. -- limits prisoners to one appeal unless the 
defendant can show by "clear and convincing evidence, that but for 
constitutional error, no reasonable fact finder would have 
found [him] guilty of the underlying offense or eligible for 
the death penalty." 
 
Under current law, there are virtually no limits or 
restrictions on when prisoners can file habeas corpus 
appeals. For example, under current law, defendants can 
appeal anytime there is a change in the law or a new Supreme 
Court ruling. Bill sponsors argue that delays of up to 14 
years are not uncommon, making abuse of the habeas corpus 
system the most significant factor in states' inability to 
implement credible death penalties. They also contend that 
current law favors the convicted criminal. For example, the 
recently-enacted crime legislation included a requirement 
that at least two lawyers be appointed to represent the 
defendant at every stage of the process. 
 
Latin for "you have the body," a habeas corpus writ is used 
to determine whether a person is lawfully imprisoned. 
Originally designed as a remedy for imprisonment without 
trial, it is now a tool of federal and state defendants who 
have been convicted and exhausted all direct appeals 
(prisoners currently have three successive procedures to 
challenge a conviction or sentence: appeal, state habeas 
corpus and federal habeas corpus). 
Critics of the current habeas corpus process argue that (1) 
most petitions are totally lacking in merit, (2) thousands upon 
thousands of frivolous petitions clog the federal district 
court dockets each year, and (3) it allows prisoners on death row 
to almost indefinitely delay their punishment. 
 
Authorization of Funds for States to Prosecute Capital 
Cases. Congress already provides funds for death penalty 
resource centers to litigate federal habeas corpus petitions 
for death row inmates. H.R. authorizes equal funding for 
states to prosecute these cases. Bill sponsors argue that 
equal funds should be provided to both the defense and the 
prosecution in these cases. 
 
Reform of Death Penalty Procedures. The bill mandates 
that juries be instructed to recommend a death sentence if 
aggravating factors (circumstances of the crime that 
increase the level of guilt) outweigh "mitigating factors" 
(circumstances that reduce the degree of moral culpability). 
Juries must also be instructed to avoid any "influence of 
sympathy, sentiment, passion, prejudice or other arbitrary 
factors" in their decisions. 
 
Under the recent omnibus crime control act, the Justice 
Department is required to notify the court and the defendant 
that it intends to seek the death penalty, and it must 
indicate the "aggravating" factors it intends to prove as 
the basis for imposition of a capital sentence. The law 
specifically states that a jury is never required to impose 
a death sentence (even if it finds that aggravating factors 
outweigh mitigating factors), and that death penalties can 
never be imposed on individuals who are mentally retarded, 
incompetent or under 18 years of age at the time of their 
crime. Critics of current law argue that it (l) establishes 
an elaborate system of aggravating and mitigating factors, 
but then allows juries to ignore the evidence and make an 
arbitrary sentencing recommendation; (2) gives too much 
discretion to a judge and jury; (3) weakens current law; and 
(4) greatly complicates the use of any new federal death 
penalty. 
 
Mandatory Minimum Sentencing for Drug Crimes (Title II) 
 
The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 (P.L. 98-473) 
created the U.S. Sentencing Commission to develop and 
monitor sentencing guidelines to be used by federal judges 
when sentencing criminal defendants. Despite the 
commission's suggestions that mandatory minimum sentences 
tend to warp the guidelines system, Congress has enacted 
about 100 mandatory minimum sentences for a variety of 
federal crimes. Many federal judges have complained that 
these restrictions are foolish, wasteful and cruel 
(sometimes requiring them to impose a sentence without 
regard to the nature of the offense or the character and 
background of the offender), and that they have no deterrent 
effect on crime. 
 
Supporters of mandatory sentences counter that they 
complement the sentencing guidelines, prevent disparity in 
sentencing, and ensure certainty of punishment. Mandatory 
minimums send a strong and unmistakable message to criminals 
that they will serve a set minimum sentence if they commit 
certain violent crimes. Mandatory minimums are also used by 
prosecutors to extract confessions from low level offenders 
in exchange for reduced sentences. The information is then 
used to build cases against criminal crime bosses. Although 
judges object to mandatory minimums because they take away 
their sentencing discretion, prosecutors see them as 
important law enforcement tools. 
 
H.R. -- establishes a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years for 
state or federal drug or violent crimes that involve 
possession of a gun. Penalties increase to 20 years for a 
second conviction and life in prison for a third. For those 
who discharge a firearm with intent to injure another 
person, the 
first offense is punishable by a minimum of 20 years in 
prison, second offenses are punishable by a minimum of 30 
years, and third violations get life in prison. 
 
Finally, possession or use of a machine gun or other 
destructive device during the commission of these crimes is 
punishable for no less than 30 years. Second-time offenses 
are punishable by life in prison. 
 
Mandatory Victim Restitution (Title III) 
 
H.R. -- mandates that criminals pay full restitution to their 
victims for damages caused as a result of the crime. 
(Current law allows the court to order that such restitution 
be made but it does not require it.) In addition, the bill 
allows (but does not require) the court to order restitution 
of any person who, as shown by a preponderance of the 
evidence, was harmed physically, emotionally or financially 
by the unlawful conduct of the defendant. 
 
Court Responsibility. Under the bill, restitution is to 
reimburse the victim for necessary child care, 
transportation and other expenses incurred while 
participating in the investigation or court proceedings. 
The court is to determine the amount of restitution based on 
the victim's situation and not on the economic resources of 
the offender or the fact that the victim is entitled to 
insurance or other compensation. The court is also to set 
the payment schedule (e.g., a single, lump-sum payment or a 
partial payment at specified intervals) and method of 
payment (e.g., cash, return of property, or replacement of 
property). 
 
Limitations on Restitution Awards. Court-ordered 
compensation is not to affect the victim's eligibility to 
receive insurance awards or other compensation until such 
time that the court-ordered compensation fully compensates 
the victim for his losses. In addition, the bill stipulates 
that if the claimant seeks additional awards in a civil 
case, any new award is to be reduced by the amount of the 
criminal court restitution order (bill supporters argue that 
claimants may seek additional awards but should not be able 
to receive a second, full compensation). 
 
Defendant Compliance. Compliance with the schedule of 
payment and other terms of the restitution order is a 
condition for probation, parole or any other form of 
release. If the defendant fails to comply with the 
restitution order, the court may revoke probation or parole, 
modify the conditions of probation or parole, hold the 
defendant in contempt of court, enter a restraining order or 
injunction against the defendant, order the sale of the 
defendant's property, or take any other action necessary to 
insure compliance with the restitution order. The victim or 
offender may, at any time, petition the court to modify a 
restitution order if the offender's economic circumstances 
change. 
 
Law Enforcement Block Grants (Title IV) 
 
H.R. -- authorizes a total of $10 million over five years ($2 
million in each of FY 1996-2000) for local governments to 
fund law enforcement programs. These block grants replace 
the police, prevention and drug courts titles of the 
recently-enacted crime bill. Under the bill, money may be 
used to (1) hire, train or employ law enforcement 
officers; (2) pay overtime to police officers; (3) purchase 
equipment and technology directly related to basic law 
enforcement purposes; (4) enhance school security measures 
(e.g., police patrols around school grounds, metal 
detectors, fences, closed circuit cameras, gun hotlines, 
etc.); (S) establish citizen neighborhood watch programs; 
and/or (6) fund programs that advance moral standards and 
the values of citizenship and involve local law enforcement 
officials. 
To qualify for these grants, a unit of local government must show 
that it will (1) establish a trust fund in which block grant 
money is to be deposited; (2) use the money within two years; (3) 
spend the money in accordance with the guidelines in this 
section; (4) use approved accounting, audit and fiscal procedures; 
(S) make any requested records available to the Bureau of Justice 
Assistance and the comptroller of the U.S. for review; and (6) 
submit the required progress reports. Each state that applies is 
to automatically receive 0.25 percent of the funds as well as 
additional funds based on its number of reported violent crimes 
in 1993 compared to the rest of the country. States are to 
distribute the funds among local units of government based on 
their population and the number of reported violent crimes in 
1993 compared to the rest of the local governmental units in the 
state. 
 
If a unit of local government does not spend all of its 
grant money within two years of receipt, it must repay the 
unused portion to the Bureau of Justice Assistance within 
three months. The bill also stipulates that (1) this grant 
money is intended to supplement, not supplant, state funds; 
(2) grantees may not use more than 2.5 percent of their 
grant for administrative costs; and (3) grantees must hold 
one public hearing on the proposed use of their grant. The 
bill also sets out procedures to be used if a local 
government violates any portion of this title. 
 
As noted above, H.R. -- repeals sections of the 
recently-enacted crime control act that provide specific 
funds for drug courts, recreational programs, community 
justice programs and other social prevention spending. Bill 
sponsors argue that providing money directly to local law 
enforcers and letting them decide how to spend the funds (as 
the Taking Back Our Streets Act does) is preferable to the 
current law approach of authorizing specific amounts of money

Grants for Prison Construction Based on Truth-in-Sentencing 
(Title V) 
 
H.R. -- authorizes $10.5 billion over six years ($232 million 
in FY 1995, $997.5 million in FY 1996, $1.3 billion in FY 
1997, $2.5 billion in FY 1998, $2.7 billion in FY 1999 and 
$2.8 billion in FY 2000) for the Attorney General to make 
grants to states so they can build, expand and operate 
prisons for serious violent felons. This title replaces the 
prison section in the recently-enacted crime bill. H.R. -- 
also authorizes the AG to make grants for states to move 
non-violent offenders and criminal aliens to 
other correctional facilities (including old military bases) to 
make room for violent criminals at existing prisons. Grants are 
to be awarded based on two formulas: a percentage that applies to 
all states (.40 percent) and a percentage based on 
population. 
 
Fifty percent of the funds authorized under this section are 
designated as "general grants." To receive these funds, 
states must show that since 1993 (1) an increased percentage 
of convicted violent offenders have been sentenced to 
prison, (2) the state has increased the average prison time 
actually served in prison, and (3) the state has increased 
the percentage of sentences to be actually served. The other 
50 percent is reserved for truth-in-sentencing incentive 
grants. To be eligible for these funds, states must show 
that they require serious violent felons to serve at least 
85 percent of the sentence imposed, and require sentencing 
or releasing authorities to allow the defendant's victim 
(or the victim's family) to testify on the issue of 
sentencing and any post-conviction release. 
 
The bill includes an exception for prisoners over the age of 
70 years after a public hearing in which representatives of 
the public and the prisoner's victims have an opportunity to 
testify on the issue of release. It also stipulates that (1) 
grant money is to supplement, not supplant, state funds; 
(2) no more than three percent of the grant is to be used by states for 
administrative costs; (3) the federal share of a grant is 
not to exceed 75 percent of the total cost of a state 
proposal; and (4) any funds not spent in one year will carry 
over and remain available until spent. 
 
Reform of the Exclusionary Rule (Title VI) 
 
The Supreme Court enforces the Constitution's Fourth 
Amendment (which protects Americans against unreasonable 
searches and seizures) through the so-called exclusionary 
rule. The rule holds that any evidence discovered as a 
result of improper police action cannot be introduced in a 
federal or state criminal trial--i.e. "the criminal is to go 
free because the constable has blundered." Critics of the 
rule's rigidity argue that it suppresses evidence of 
unquestionable reliability and leads to the acquittal of 
many who are obviously guilty. In 1984, the Supreme Court 
modified the exclusionary rule to permit the introduction of 
evidence that was obtained in good faith reliance on a 
search warrant that was later found to be invalid. However, 
many have called for a "good faith exemption" in cases where 
the police officer, acting in good faith, conducted a search 
or seizure without a warrant. 
 
H.R. -- amends current law to allow introduction of evidence 
obtained during a search or seizure that was conducted 
with the objectively reasonable belief that it was 
in accordance with the fourth amendment, regardless of whether 
a search warrant had been granted. 
 
Prisoner Lawsuits (Title VII) 
 
H.R. -- directs federal courts to dismiss any frivolous or 
malicious action brought by an adult convicted of a crime 
and confined in any jail, prison or other correctional 
facility. The bill also requires that prisoners filing a 
suit include a statement of all assets in their possession 
so the court can require a full or partial payment of filing 
fees based on the prisoner's ability to pay. 
 
Bill sponsors argue that states are forced to spend millions 
of dollars defending prisoner lawsuits to improve prison 
conditions--many of which are frivolous. Critics of the 
proposal argue that it will restrict prisoners' rights to 
seek legitimate redress of grievances. 
 
Deportation of Criminal Aliens (Title VIII) 
 
This title of the bill provides for the prompt deportation 
of any alien without a green card who has been convicted of 
an aggravated felony and who is deportable. According to 
bill sponsors, it addresses the current problem of releasing 
these felons into the general population prior to 
finalization of deportation proceedings, since few of those 
released ever show up for their deportation hearings. 
 
Definition of an Aggravated Felony. For purposes of alien 
felon deportation, the bill expands the definition of an 
aggravated felony to include any state or federal offense 
involving (l) firearms violations; (2) failure to appear in 
court for a felony carrying a sentence of two or more years; 
(3) demanding or receiving ransom money; (4) a RICO 
violation; (5) owning, controlling, managing or supervising 
a prostitution business; (6) treason; (7) tax evasion 
exceeding $200,000; and (8) certain immigration-related 
offenses including alien smuggling and sale of fraudulent 
documents. Sponsors of the bill argue that these crimes are 
serious enough to put a convicted alien on the fast track 
for deportation. 
The current law definition of an aggravated felony includes 
murder, drug trafficking, trafficking in firearms or explosives, 
money laundering, terrorism, and any crime of violence carrying a 
prison sentence of at least five years. 
 
Criminal Alien Deportation Proceedings. The bill allows the 
Attorney General to issue a final order of deportation 
against any alien determined to be deportable for conviction 
of an aggravated felony (without requiring a deportation 
hearing). An alien is defined as anyone who (1) was not 
lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. at the 
time that proceedings for the commission of an aggravated 
crime began or (2) had permanent resident status on a 
conditional basis at the time that proceedings for the 
commission of an aggravated crime began. An alien against 
whom a deportation order is issued may appeal for judicial 
review in federal court; however, the court action is 
limited to challenging only the defendant's identification 
(whether the person is who the immigration and 
Naturalization Service [INS] says he is and whether he 
committed the aggravated felony). 
 
Judicial Deportations. When an alien whose conviction causes 
him to be deemed deportable is sentenced, a federal court 
may issue a judicial order of deportation if the U.S. 
attorney requested one prior to sentencing and the INS 
commissioner is in agreement. A judicial order of 
deportation or a denial of such order may be appealed by 
either party to the circuit court of appeals. A court 
action, however, is limited to challenging only the 
defendant's identification (whether the person is who the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service [INS] says he is and 
whether he committed the aggravated felony). 
 
If a judicial order is denied, the Attorney General may 
still pursue a deportation order through administrative 
channels. 
 
Defenses Based on Permanent Residence. Under current law, 
when an alien is in deportation proceedings, he can use 
certain defenses to get out. One such defense is showing 
that he has been a permanent resident of the United States 
for the past seven years. H.R. -- does not change the 
underlying defense, but changes the time frame in which INS 
can begin deportation proceedings against an alien convicted 
of an aggravated offense. Under current law, deportation 
proceedings are to begin after the alien has served five 
years. H.R. -- allows INS to begin deportation proceedings when 
an alien is sentenced to a term of at least five years. Bill 
sponsors argue that this standard is more relevant for 
judging the seriousness of a crime since dangerous criminals 
may be released prematurely due to prison overcrowding, or 
other reasons not related to the seriousness of the crime. 
 
Defenses Based on Withholding of Deportation. Aliens may 
also reverse deportation proceedings by showing that they 
will suffer physical harm if returned to their native 
country. As defined by international law, "withholding of 
deportation" is a higher standard of protection than asylum: 
if an alien can prove such a situation exists, he must be 
retained in the U.S. unless he poses a danger to the public. 
H.R. -- clarifies current law to stipulate that aggravated 
felons pose a serious danger to the public and are not 
allowed to request or be granted this protection. 
 
Enhanced Penalties for Failing to Deport or Reentering. 
Under current law, aliens who are deportable for criminal 
offenses, for document fraud or because they are a security 
risk to the U.S. face up to 10 years in prison for failure 
to depart. Bill sponsors argue that there are no penalties 
for aliens who are deportable for other reasons but refuse to leave. 
H.R. -- retains the current law penalty and establishes a penalty 
of up to four years in prison for all other deportable 
aliens who refuse to leave. The bill also establishes civil 
penalties for those who refuse to leave. 
Under current law, an alien who is convicted of a felony 
(other than an aggravated offense), is deported and then 
reenters the country is subject to five years in prison and 
a criminal fine. H.R. -- extends such penalties to aliens 
convicted of three or more misdemeanors and increases the 
maximum sentence to 10 years. Deported aggravated felons who 
re-enter the U.S. are currently subject to criminal fines 
and up to 15 years in prison. H.R. -- increases the maximum 
prison sentence to 20 years. 
 
Finally, under the bill, a deported alien who re-enters the 
U.S. cannot challenge his original deportation unless he 
can show that (1) all available administrative remedies 
were exhausted, (2) an opportunity for judicial review was 
denied, and (3) the deportation order was fundamentally 
unfair. 
 
Criminal Alien Tracking Center. The bill directs the INS 
commissioner and the director of the FBI, with the heads of 
other agencies, to operate a criminal tracking center. The 
measure authorizes $14 million over four years ($5 million 
in FY 1994 and $2 million in each of FY 1995-98) for the 
center, which is to assist federal, state and local law 
enforcement agencies identify and locate aliens who may be 
subject to deportation due to conviction of an aggravated 
felony.

Plaintiff SUSAN ANSPACH alleges as follows: <p>


PARTIES<p>

1. Plaintiff SUSAN ANSPACH ("ANSPACH") is an individual residing in the County of Los Angeles. She currently resides at 473 Sixteenth Street ("the Property") in Santa Monica, California. She is the owner of this property and has been the owner of the Property since 1979. <p>

2. Defendant JACK NICHOLSON ("NICHOLSON"), is a resident of the County of Los Angeles. He is an actor. <p>

3. PROTEUS FILMS, INC., MONEY PURCHASE PENSION PLAN, ("PROTEUS") is a corporation duly organized and entitled to do business in the State of California. PROTEUS is the pension fund organized under PROTEUS and maintained by defendant NICHOLSON. PROTEUS funds were used by defendants NICHOLSON and COLBERT to fund the personal "loans" to plaintiff ANSPACH as described in this complaint. <p>

4. Defendant ROBERT COLBERT ("COLBERT"), was at all times relevant hereto business manager and agent for Defendant NICHOLSON. COLBERT acted as NICHOLSON's agent in all his dealings with ANSPACH as alleged in this complaint. Defendant COLBERT was at all times relevant hereto responsible for the management and disbursal of funds for PROTEUS and for NICHOLSON. NICHOLSON told ANSPACH that COLBERT possessed authority to act on his behalf on financial matters, including the matters alleged in this complaint, and that ANSPACH was to deal only with COLBERT on such matters. He is a resident of the County of Los Angeles. <p>


FACTS COMMON TO ALL CLAIMS<p>

5. In December 1969 plaintiff ANSPACH and defendant NICHOLSON had a romantic affair during the filming of the critically-acclaimed film Five Easy Pieces in Vancouver, British Columbia. During this affair ANSPACH and NICHOLSON conceived a son, Caleb, who was born on September 26, 1970, at or around the time of the premier of Five Easy Pieces in New York. In or about early 1970, NICHOLSON called ANSPACH requesting that they speak about her pregnancy. ANSPACH did not meet with him because Mark Goddard, who became her husband in June 1970, was upset that ANSPACH was pregnant with NICHOLSON's child and did not want her to see NICHOLSON. <p>

6. NICHOLSON has expressed and has long held a personal animosity toward ANSPACH over her ending the relationship and her failure to involve NICHOLSON in Caleb's early childhood years. ANSPACH was unaware of this deeply felt hostility until very recently. NICHOLSON's animosity toward ANSPACH is the primary reason why NICHOLSON has acted as alleged in this complaint to impose enormous psychological suffering and emotional distress on ANSPACH. In addition, NICHOLSON has acted as alleged in this complaint to control ANSPACH from discussing the details of their relationship and of his relationship to Caleb in the media. <p>

7. During ANSPACH's divorce proceedings in 1977, NICHOLSON and ANSPACH discussed for the first time NICHOLSON's assumption of a fatherly role in their son Caleb's life. NICHOLSON assured ANSPACH that he would assume a fatherly role toward Caleb as soon as he felt ready to handle it. He took no action to do so at that time. <p>

8. In 1979 ANSPACH purchased her home at 473 16th Street, Santa Monica, California. Caleb grew up in this home, and still thinks of it as his family home and returns to the home on visits. He continues to store most of his personal belongings and his car at the home. ANSPACH sought no assistance from NICHOLSON for the purchase of this home and did not ask NICHOLSON for any financial assistance for Caleb or herself until Caleb went to college in 1988. ANSPACH had a successful acting career and was able to support herself and her family. <p>

9. By approximately the summer of 1988, ANSPACH began to have financial difficulties and realized that she might be forced to sell the home. When ANSPACH and Caleb discussed the difficulties of maintaining the house, Caleb told ANSPACH that he did not want to lose the home because it had been their family anchor. When ANSPACH asked for money in 1988, she told NICHOLSON and COLBERT that the purpose of NICHOLSON's help was to fulfill his son's wish of keeping the family home. ANSPACH told COLBERT of her emotionally vulnerable state due to the break up of her marriage to Sherwood Ball, her kids going away to college, and the faltering of her acting career. <p>

10. ANSPACH's vulnerable financial and emotional condition provided NICHOLSON an opportunity to control her life through his "assistance," and ultimately to exact revenge for being hurt by ANSPACH. Starting in 1988, NICHOLSON provided plaintiff ANSPACH with direct financial assistance by a number of $10,000 loans. When ANSPACH asked NICHOLSON for money, NICHOLSON told ANSPACH he would be happy to help her out, and forcefully told her that any money dealings were to be handled only through COLBERT. ANSPACH signed one promissory note for one of these loans in the amount of $10,000 at 10% interest, which stated no due date for repayment. COLBERT told ANSPACH to sign this promissory note for tax purposes. COLBERT, acting as NICHOLSON's agent, agreed that these loans would only be repaid if ANSPACH's career became financially successful again. Between 1988 and 1991, NICHOLSON gave ANSPACH a total of approximately one hundred twenty thousand dollars ($120,000.00), under the same conditions. These payments to ANSPACH were made in increments of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) each. Except for the one promissory note for $10,000, ANSPACH was not asked to sign promissory notes for any of these loans. In May of 1992, ANSPACH repaid NICHOLSON $20,000 because she was in a position to do so. On information and belief, the remainder of these "loans" were to have been written off by defendant NICHOLSON as "bad debts," presumably for the tax benefits they provide to NICHOLSON. Consistent with the agreement between ANSPACH and NICHOLSON, until ANSPACH filed her first complaint on October 30, 1995, NICHOLSON and COLBERT had never attempted to collect these amounts and had never indicated that these "loans" had to be repaid. In December 1995, after plaintiff filed suit, NICHOLSON sent her a demand for repayment of alleged "loans" in excess of $200,000. <p>


DEFENDANTS' CONSPIRACY TO CONTROL ANSPACH <p>

11. NICHOLSON intended to control ANSPACH and cause her to suffer for the anger NICHOLSON felt toward her. COLBERT was aware of NICHOLSON's animosity toward ANSPACH and aided NICHOLSON in controlling and manipulating her starting in 1989 through "loan" documents which created on paper a second trust against her house and enabled defendants to hold a "sword of Damocles" over ANSPACH'S head from 1989 to the present. NICHOLSON and COLBERT engaged in a conspiracy to control ANSPACH's ability to speak publicly about NICHOLSON and his relationship to Caleb; to humiliate ANSPACH and impose suffering on her and repay her for the hurt NICHOLSON suffered by her actions in 1970. NICHOLSON and COLBERT used the control acquired over ANSPACH through the "loans" to influence her against speaking publicly about NICHOLSON's fatherhood of Caleb and to inflict emotional distress upon her through NICHOLSON's verbal abuse and COLBERT's inappropriate sexual advances. <p>


THE 1989 PROMISES<p>

12. In approximately September or October of 1988, after defendant NICHOLSON began paying for Caleb's college tuition and expenses at Georgetown University, plaintiff ANSPACH requested assistance from NICHOLSON in order to maintain Caleb's family home in Santa Monica. ANSPACH followed NICHOLSON's wishes that she not deal with him concerning money matters and made her request for assistance to COLBERT. Defendant NICHOLSON, through defendants COLBERT and PROTEUS, "loaned" plaintiff ANSPACH $205,000. The entire basis of this agreement, as discussed between Anspach and Colbert, was that ANSPACH would repay the amounts loaned to her as soon as her career rebounded and she could afford to do so. The parties recognized that this could happen at any time. Though plaintiff ANSPACH requested that defendant NICHOLSON simply pay off the first trust deed, defendant COLBERT insisted that the "loan" be handled in the same manner as the smaller $10,000 loans. Plaintiff ANSPACH was asked to sign a promissory note indicating on paper that the $205,000 plus 10 1/2 % interest would be "duet" in a balloon payment in 1994. The note was secured on paper by a second trust deed on plaintiff's home. This interest rate was much too high for a genuine transaction but ANSPACH was told by COLBERT that it didn't matter and that she shouldn't worry about the formal arrangements. Defendant COLBERT explained that structuring the "loan" this way would look good on paper because the money would appear to be earning 10 1/2 % interest instead of the 3% to 5% it would earn anywhere else. Defendant COLBERT knew of NICHOLSON's desire to obtain control over ANSPACH and COLBERT aided in NICHOLSON's plan to carry out his desires by promising ANSPACH on several occasions that they would never cause her to lose her home. <p>

13. ANSPACH was apprehensive and nervous about signing the "loan" papers notwithstanding COLBERT's representations. Though ANSPACH tried to abide by NICHOLSON's request that she not bring up money with him, she felt such anxiety about signing these papers that ANSPACH called defendant NICHOLSON directly to express her fears and ask why the "loan" had to be tied on paper to her house, given the fact that she wouldn't have to repay the loans until her career rebounded. ANSPACH had made it clear to NICHOLSON that she was seeking financial assistance until her career rebounded to maintain the family home for Caleb even though she could have sold the home and made more than $1 million profit at that time. ANSPACH asked defendant NICHOLSON why she was being required to sign documents that, at least on paper, could put her home in jeopardy and told NICHOLSON that she was insecure about signing the documents COLBERT wanted her to sign, even though they might assist NICHOLSON. Defendant NICHOLSON told ANSPACH to do what COLBERT said. ANSPACH asked again why she needed to sign the second trust deed, and NICHOLSON told her not to worry. Defendant NICHOLSON promised "I am a compassionate and empathetic person, I will never abandon you, but I leave money matters up to Mr. C. I don't walk out on people." ANSPACH asked, "Are you going to walk out on me?" NICHOLSON responded "I'm not going to walk out on you. I'm not going to abandon you." NICHOLSON promised ANSPACH that if she could not repay the "loan," she would not lose her home. All of these representations were false when they were made. <p>

14. By structuring the "loan" transaction in the way they did, defendants trapped ANSPACH into a financial treadmill from which she could not escape. Defendants did not give her enough money to pay off the first trust deed and the interest charges on defendants' second trust deed accrued at an exorbitant rate. Defendants knew that once ANSPACH accepted their "assistance" in 1989 they had complete control over her and could force her to lose her home at any time by enforcing the "loan" documents they made her sign based on false representations and reassurances that they would not allow her to lose her home. <p>

15. From the time ANSPACH was asked to sign these "loan" papers until the present, ANSPACH has been told by NICHOLSON that he would give her the financial help she needed and to maintain the home and to do what COLBERT said. COLBERT, in contrast, told her that the reason NICHOLSON was not paying off the first trust deed entirely was that he wasn't ready to do so yet. ANSPACH told defendants that she did not understand why NICHOLSON did not just pay off her first trust deed for approximately $390,000, instead of adding a second trust deed to the house. Aware of NICHOLSON's plan to maintain control over ANSPACH, defendant COLBERT strung ANSPACH along by telling her that he was sure that defendant NICHOLSON would "come to his senses" and eventually do the right thing and buy the house for Caleb. In this way, COLBERT lulled ANSPACH into a trap devised by defendants NICHOLSON and COLBERT to control and humiliate her. There was never any discussion between the parties that plaintiff ANSPACH would be obligated to repay the "loan" or that defendants could or would foreclose on her family home if she lacked the resources to pay the "loan". Such actions are completely at odds with the entire basis of the agreement in 1989 and after. Defendants led ANSPACH to believe that they concurred with her that the underlying reason for the entire arrangement was to keep the family home of NICHOLSON's son. In fact, COLBERT assured ANSPACH that she had nothing to worry about in signing the papers. Though ANSPACH always intended to repay NICHOLSON, it was understood by the parties that defendants would never force her to sell the house to repay these "loans" to defendants if her career had not rebounded. In part, this was based on the parties' knowledge that defendant NICHOLSON is worth more than $150 million and has purchased homes for his other children, including a home he purchased, in or about 1990, for $2.475 million for his daughter Jennifer directly across the street from the Property. Plaintiff had no reason to believe that NICHOLSON would foreclose on their family home if she was unable to make the balloon payments described in the documents she signed. <p>

16. Based on these promises plaintiff ANSPACH did not sell the family home in 1989 even though the house was worth nearly $1.5 million in 1989 and had less than $400,000 in encumbrances at that time. She relied on the representations made by NICHOLSON and COLBERT in attempting to hold on to the house, as Caleb wished her to do. Had plaintiff ANSPACH known of defendants" scheme to control her or that they would renege on their promises, she would not have assumed the additional "debt" and would have sold the house at a substantial profit of approximately $1 million in 1989. <p>

17. Approximately one year after NICHOLSON made his first promises to ANSPACH, ANSPACH and NICHOLSON had another telephone conversation where ANSPACH expressed her anxiety about the "loan" and losing her house. ANSPACH was anxious because in the year after the first "loan" was made to ANSPACH, COLBERT had attempted to use the situation to make inappropriate romantic advances toward ANSPACH. These inappropriate overtures by COLBERT caused ANSPACH's level of discomfort to increase. During this telephone conversation however, NICHOLSON again reassured ANSPACH that she had nothing to worry about and she would not lose her home. NICHOLSON reminded ANSPACH that COLBERT was on her side, that she was a friend, and that NICHOLSON was not ever going to take her home away from her. <p>

18. During 1989, COLBERT made advances toward ANSPACH approximately twice when she went to his office to pick up Georgetown tuition checks. COLBERT made ANSPACH feel trapped and uncomfortable. ANSPACH had to deal with COLBERT because NICHOLSON made it clear she had to deal with COLBERT on all issues relating to money. ANSPACH was forced to see him periodically to conduct her financial dealings with NICHOLSON, despite COLBERT's inappropriate behavior because NICHOLSON had instructed her that COLBERT was acting for him in these matters. This was part of defendants' plan to humiliate ANSPACH and cause her to suffer. <p>


THE 1992 PROMISES<p>

19. In March 1992 plaintiff ANSPACH's career wag still in difficulty and she was in no position to maintain the house without further assistance. Defendants arranged to supply plaintiff ANSPACH with another $200,000 using Proteus as the source of funds for this personal "loan" to ANSPACH. In form defendant PROTEUS "loaned" plaintiff ANSPACH $476,000; however, $276,000 was used to "pay off" the 1989 loan plus accumulated interest. This "loan" was also secured on paper by a second trust deed on plaintiff's home. <p>

20. When the new $200,000 was given to ANSPACH in 1992, NICHOLSON and COLBERT again convinced her through fraudulent representations, to sign documents which would make NICHOLSON's financial assistance to ANSPACH and their son appear as a loan for tax purposes. ANSPACH again told NICHOLSON and COLBERT that she never wanted to lose the house due to its importance as a family anchor for Caleb. NICHOLSON and COLBERT again reassured her that the forms were for business purposes and that she would never be abandoned. ANSPACH was led by defendants to believe that they would never take her family home away from her and that they would continue to assist her until her career rebounded and she could maintain the house and begin to repay the "loans." These representations were false when they were made. <p>

21. Based on defendants promises that ANSPACH would not lose her house by signing the new "loan" documents, ANSPACH signed "loan" documents again in 1992 as requested by COLBERT. ANSPACH relied on defendants' representations and did not sell her home in 1992 at a substantial profit. <p>


THE SEPTEMBER 1994 PROMISE<p>

22. In August 1993, ANSPACH obtained tenants for her home because she could not make the first trust deed payments on her own. By having tenants she could hold on to the house indefinitely until her career rebounded and she could meet these payments and repay NICHOLSON. In September 1994 plaintiff ANSPACH arranged for a meeting with defendant COLBERT in order to discuss the fact that her tenants were leaving in October and what to do about this. At this point plaintiff had to decide whether to arrange to get new tenants or to move back into the house. In this meeting defendant COLBERT agreed that defendants would make sure that the payments on the first trust deed would be made by defendants for at least three years so that ANSPACH could move back into the house and would not have to get tenants in order to maintain it. It was clearly understood by COLBERT and ANSPACH that plaintiff would not be expected to make any payments to PROTEUS on the $476,000 trust deed in the spring of 1995, when it became "due" on paper, or at any other time until she could afford to do so. ANSPACH was again assured that she had nothing to worry about and that defendants would make sure that she would not lose the house. COLBERT knew at the time of the September 1994 meeting that ANSPACH would move back into the house and would not get new tenants based on his representations at the time. The parties discussed the fact that ANSPACH had to move back into the house in October, if no new tenants were obtained, because it was necessary for the house to be occupied. <p>

23. Based on these representations plaintiff ANSPACH did not rent her home to new tenants and she did not make payments on the first trust deed. ANSPACH moved more than 350 boxes of her and her children's personal belongings back into the house in October 1994. Over ninety of these boxes contain Caleb's belongings. She began to refurbish the house, as had been discussed with COLBERT. Relying on COLBERT's representation" that he would take care of the first trust deed payments, ANSPACH did not obtain new tenants for the house and organized her personal and business life around COLBERT's assurances that she need not worry about paying the first trust deed or about any payments theoretically "due" under the second trust deed. <p>

24. In January 1995 defendants, without warning, suddenly stated that they would not abide by any of the above-described promises, assurances and representations and intended to foreclose on plaintiff's home. Since then plaintiff has been subjected to extreme emotional distress, as defendants have proceeded to foreclose on her family home despite years of promises that they would never do so. <p>

25. NICHOLSON and COLBERT began trustee's sale proceedings on or about August 2, 1995, in violation of their agreement with ANSPACH. In November 1995, defendants' attorneys promised that they would give plaintiff 30 days advance notice of their intention to publish a Notice of Sale. In reliance on this promise plaintiff did not seek a preliminary injunction. <p>

DEFENDANTS' OUTRAGEOUS AND MANIPULATIVE CONDUCT <p>

26. In 1988, plaintiff ANSPACH turned to defendant NICHOLSON for help because of their long-term relationship over the years since their 1969 affair and because he was the father of their son, Caleb. COLBERT and NICHOLSON falsely led ANSPACH to believe that they were interested in doing what was best for her and Caleb. ANSPACH was falsely led to believe that defendants were acting in good faith and with integrity and fidelity toward her. <p>

27. Defendants instead acted in bad faith toward ANSPACH by persuading her to sign their "loan" documents with assurances that she would not lose the house. NICHOLSON exploited ANSPACH's dire financial and emotional situation and Caleb's longing for a real relationship with his father to exact revenge for his anger at ANSPACH. NICHOLSON and COLBERT used the power they acquired through the "loans" to deter ANSPACH from speaking publicly about NICHOLSON, to keep her dependent on defendants, to verbally abuse her, to make inappropriate advances toward her, and to cause her severe emotional distress. NICHOLSON subjected ANSPACH to outrageous verbal abuse in conversations they had starting in 1994 and continuing into the Spring of 1995. The only reason NICHOLSON had the opportunity to subject ANSPACH to this outrageous abuse was the control he had acquired over her through the 1989 and 1992 "loans." <p>

28. Between 1989 and 1995, defendants subjected ANSPACH to physical and emotional abuse based upon the financial control they obtained over her through the 1989 and 1992 "loans." Defendant COLBERT made unwelcome sexual advances to ANSPACH on many occasions when she was forced by NICHOLSON to deal with COLBERT regarding money matters. Defendants repeatedly resisted any proposal from ANSPACH concerning the house that would eliminate their control over her. <p>

29. NICHOLSON's outbursts were intended to humiliate and degrade ANSPACH and to cause her severe emotional distress to pay her back for past hurt feelings felt by NICHOLSON. The language used by NICHOLSON was outrageous and vulgar. His tone of voice was uncivilized and intentionally demeaning to ANSPACH. NICHOLSON knew how upset and vulnerable ANSPACH was and he intentionally imposed severe emotional distress on her. He repeatedly referred to her body parts and used vulgar language to demean her efforts over the years to be independent. <p>

30. In 1994, ANSPACH wrote a letter to Vanity Fair magazine in 1994, concerning NICHOLSON's fatherhood of Caleb. ANSPACH's letter angered NICHOLSON. NICHOLSON publicly reprimanded ANSPACH in The New York Times, called and verbally abused her, and punished her through the control he had over her home. After the Vanity Fair letter, NICHOLSON's verbal abuse of ANSPACH became frequent, malicious, and vulgar. Defendant NICHOLSON screamed at ANSPACH that "women are all weak, frightened c---s." NICHOLSON told ANSPACH she was an "idiot" and a "bitch," and that ANSPACH was "an unpredictable c---." In or about March, 1994, defendant NICHOLSON laughed at ANSPACH's predicament and taunted, "you're a miserable bitch, a miserable drunken bitch, and now you owe me money too." These words were intended to and had the effect of causing ANSPACH severe emotional distress. Defendants' retaliation against ANSPACH culminated in the initiation of foreclosure proceedings on her home in August, 1995, completely forsaking their promises that they would not enforce the "loans." <p>

31. Between 1988 and the present, ANSPACH has suffered and been treated for physical and mental manifestations of the emotional distress defendants caused her. ANSPACH has been treated for stress-related recurring cluster headaches, severely exacerbated allergies, premature menopause, grinding down her teeth, recurring bladder and yeast infections, dry skin, hair loss, a double hernia, and stress-induced arthritis. ANSPACH's psychological harm is also severe. ANSPACH has been treated for panic attacks, trauma, anxiety, depression, acute sleep disturbances, nightmares, suicidal ideations, and eating disorder. <p>


FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(Fraud)
(Against All Defendants)<p>

32. Paragraphs 1 through 31 are incorporated by reference and realleged as if set forth herein. <p>


The 1989 "Loan"<p>

33. In 1988, NICHOLSON and COLBERT promised falsely that ANSPACH would not lose her home by signing the "loan" documents and that plaintiff would only have to repay the "loan" when her career had rebounded and she had the financial resources to do so. Plaintiff is informed and believes that NICHOLSON and COLBERT made this representation without any intention of performing it. Instead, NICHOLSON made the representation to placate ANSPACH and cause her to feel that he was upholding his obligation to ANSPACH and Caleb and to put himself in a position to exert control over her. COLBERT knowingly participated in NICHOLSON's plan to obtain control over ANSPACH by falsely promising her that the "loan" would not be collected unless she was able to repay it. Defendants led ANSPACH to believe that she signed the "loan" documents only for the tax and other benefits they would give NICHOLSON. <p>

34. Defendants intended to use the control they obtained over ANSPACH to prevent her from speaking publicly about NICHOLSON and to emotionally manipulate ANSPACH for purposes of revenge. COLBERT intended to use his powerful position as NICHOLSON's agent to make inappropriate advances toward ANSPACH. Defendants conspired to take advantage of ANSPACH by exploiting her desire to keep the family home, while defendants enjoyed tax benefits and the power to manipulate ANSPACH's life. <p>

35. ANSPACH reasonably relied on NICHOLSON and COLBERT's promises by signing the "loan" documents based on defendants' assurances, remaining in the house and not selling it. ANSPACH was harmed in an amount exceeding $1 million because she relied on defendants' promises to her detriment in deciding not to sell the house in 1989. Plaintiff would never have kept the house if she knew that defendants would abandon her and initiate foreclosure of her home. <p>


The 1992 "Loan"<p>

36. In 1992, defendants promised falsely that ANSPACH would not lose her home by signing the PROTEUS "loan" documents. Defendants assured ANSPACH that the "loan" documents were for the tax benefits they provided NICHOLSON only, and that ANSPACH would not be expected to repay the "loan" until her career rebounded and she had the financial resources to do so. Defendants did not intend to keep their promises to ANSPACH. Instead, defendants intended to use the power obtained by persuading ANSPACH to sign the "loan" documents to deter her from speaking publicly and to control her. COLBERT knowingly participated in NICHOLSON's plan to harm ANSPACH. <p>

37. ANSPACH reasonably relied on defendants, promises by foregoing sale of the house in 1992, though she could have made a profit of at least $500,000 if she had sold the house in 1992. Plaintiff would never have kept the house if she knew that defendants would abandon her and initiate foreclosure of her home in August, 1995. <p>


The September 1994 Promises<p>

38 . COLBERT, acting as NICHOLSON's agent, promised ANSPACH that defendants would take care of the first bunt deed payments for at least three years and that she would not lose her home due to defendants' "loan" during the next three years. Defendants maliciously intended that ANSPACH rely on these promises so that they could carry out their plan to control her public statements and harm her by foreclosing on their "loan." <p>

39 . ANSPACH did rely on COLBERT's promises by moving back into the house instead of finding new tenants to move into the home so that the first trust deed payments could be made. Had ANSPACH known that defendants would not keep these promises, she would have rented the house to new tenants, and could have paid the first mortgage payment with the rental proceeds. She would not have gone to the expense and difficulty of moving back into the home or of beginning to refurbish the house. By waiting until January 1995 to renege on their promises, defendants made it impossible for ANSPACH to maintain her home even by obtaining new tenants. <p>

40. As a result of defendants' actions, plaintiff has been damaged by the loss of profits she would have received had she sold her home in 1989 or 1992; by the loss of her home; and by the emotional distress she has suffered because of defendants' fraudulent actions, in an amount to be determined at trial. <p>

41. Defendants acted with malice, fraud, and oppression to plaintiff; therefore plaintiff is entitled to an award of punitive damages in an amount to be determined at trial. <p>


SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
(Breach of Contract)
(Against All Defendants)<p>

42. The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 41 are incorporated by reference and fully realleged as if set forth herein. <p>

The 1989 Contract<p>

43. Defendant NICHOLSON directly, and through his agent and co-conspirator COLBERT, promised ANSPACH that she would not have to repay the money he advanced to her in 1989 unless she was in a financial condition to do so and that he would not take any steps to cause ANSPACH to lose her home as a result of the money he "loaned" to her or the "loan" papers he asked her to sign with Proteus for NICHOLSON'S benefit. <p>

44. Defendant NICHOLSON's promises are enforceable because of his long standing legal and moral obligation to support his son Caleb. Defendant COLBERT promised ANSPACH that the "loan" papers were for tax purposes only, and specifically assured ANSPACH that she would not lose her home by signing the "loan" documents. As Caleb's father, NICHOLSON had a past enforceable legal obligation to support him until Caleb reached eighteen years of age. NICHOLSON also had a moral obligation to support his son. The aforementioned detrimental reliance by ANSPACH, combined with NICHOLSON's past legal and moral obligations to ANSPACH and Caleb, create an implied contract. NICHOLSON has breached this contract by initiating proceedings to foreclose on the home. This sale is based on ANSPACH's default of the purported "loan," which when made, was agreed by all parties to be a loan only for tax purposes. <p>

45. Plaintiff ANSPACH relied on defendants' promises when she signed the purported "loan" documents and by not selling the house in 1989 when it was worth approximately $1.5 million. Had defendants not promised ANSPACH that they would help her keep the family home in 1989, ANSPACH would have had no choice but to sell the home and would have made a profit of $1 million, the exact amount to be proven at trial. <p>


The 1992 Contract<p>

46. Defendants promised ANSPACH in 1992 that she would not lose her home by signing the "loan" documents and that she would not have to repay the "loan" if she could not do so. Defendants' 1992 promises are enforceable because of NICHOLSON's moral obligation and his past enforceable legal obligation to support Caleb, combined with ANSPACH's change in position based on defendants' promises. ANSPACH relied on these promises, signed the "loan" documents and did not sell her house in 1992. <p>

47. Had defendants not promised ANSPACH that they would continue to help her keep the family home in 1992, she would have been forced to sell the home. At that time ANSPACH would have earned a profit of at least $500,000, an exact amount to be proven at trial. <p>


The September 1994 Contract<p>

48. Defendant COLBERT, as NICHOLSON's agent and coconspirator, promised ANSPACH that defendants would pay the first mortgage payments for three years and that ANSPACH would not be expected to make payments on the PROTEUS "loan" in the Spring of 1995, or at any other time. Based on these promises, ANSPACH did not find new tenants, and moved into the house in September of 1994. <p>

49. Had defendants not promised ANSPACH that they would pay the first mortgage payments for three years, ANSPACH would have re- rented the house to new tenants and could have covered the first mortgage payments with the rental income. <p>

50. Defendants are estopped from raising the Statute of Frauds as a bar to enforcement of the aforementioned contracts because ANSPACH changed position by signing the "loan" documents and not selling her home and in 1994 moved back into the house instead of re-renting it, in reliance upon defendants' oral promises. ANSPACH will be unconscionably injured by the loss of her home if the agreement is not enforced. <p>

51. ANSPACH seeks specific performance of the implied contracts and damages in an amount to be determined at trial. <p>


THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
(Promissory Estoppel)
(Against All Defendants)<p>

52. Paragraphs 1 through 51 are incorporated by reference and realleged as if set forth herein. <p>


The 1989 Promises<p>

53. In 1988, defendants promised ANSPACH that she did not have to repay the "loan" unless and until she was able, and that by signing the "loan" papers she would not lose her house. NICHOLSON made these promises in response to ANSPACH when she asked him why she had to sign these "loan" documents and whether she should sign them because she did not want to lose her home. Defendant COLBERT assured ANSPACH that the "loan" papers were never to be enforced by their terms; they were for the tax benefits they would provide to NICHOLSON only. The promises made by defendants were specific and unambiguous, otherwise ANSPACH would not have signed the "loan" documents. <p>

54. NICHOLSON and COLBERT expected ANSPACH to reasonably rely on their promises to take care of the house. On January 17, 1989, when the first "loan" in the amount of two hundred five thousand dollars ($205,000.00), was given to ANSPACH, NICHOLSON and COLBERT expected ANSPACH to rely on their promises by refraining from selling the house at that time. <p>

55. It was reasonable for ANSPACH to rely on defendants' promises. ANSPACH verified whether she should rely on COLBERT's promises on NICHOLSON's behalf by calling NICHOLSON in late 1988, before she signed the "loan" papers to seek reassurance from NICHOLSON that she would not lose her house by signing the documents. NICHOLSON reassured ANSPACH that she would not lose her home and he would not abandon her. The entire basis of the conversations between ANSPACH and COLBERT was that ANSPACH would not have to repay these "loans" until she was in a financial position to do so. <p>


The 1992 Promises<p>

56. Defendants promised ANSPACH in 1992 that she did not have to repay the "loan" until she was financially able, and that she would not lose her house as a result of signing the "loan" documents. COLBERT assured ANSPACH that the "loan" documents were for tax purposes only and ANSPACH would not be expected to repay unless she was financially able to do so. <p>

57. Again on March 31, 1992, when the second "loan" agreement was made between ANSPACH and NICHOLSON and COLBERT, defendants expected her to rely on their promises by not selling the house. ANSPACH did refrain from selling the house, though she could have earned a profit of at least $500,000, had she known that defendants would not keep their promises. <p>

58. It was reasonable for ANSPACH to rely on these promises. COLBERT again reassured ANSPACH that she would not lose her home by signing the "loan" documents and that the basis of the parties, agreements was the intention of keeping the family home for Caleb. ANSPACH was again assured by defendants that she would not be expected to repay the "loans" until she became financially able to do so. <p>

59. Defendants are estopped from denying their obligations to ANSPACH by ANSPACH's reasonable reliance on their promises. <p>

60. ANSPACH will suffer the loss of the property as a result of NICHOLSON's breach. The loss of this unique piece of real estate, which has great significance to Caleb as a family anchor, I would be irreparable. <p>

61. ANSPACH seeks specific performance of NICHOLSON's promise. ANSPACH also seeks damages for costs incurred in reliance on NICHOLSON's promises in an amount to be determined at trial. <p>


The September 1994 Promise<p>

62. COLBERT, acting as NICHOLSON's agent, made a specific promise to extend the "loan" to ANSPACH for at least three years and to pay the payments on the first mortgage on the home for three years. The manner in which this would be accomplished was left to COLBERT. COLBERT knew that ANSPACH would rely on his promises based on the explicit discussion that ANSPACH had to move back into the house so that it would not remain empty. <p>

63. ANSPACH reasonably relied on COLBERT's promise", by moving back into the house in October 1994 and in foregoing obtaining new tenants to live in the house and make the payments on the first trust deed. She incurred considerable expenses in moving back into the home and began to refurbish the home based on defendants, representations. <p>

64. Defendants are estopped from asserting the statute of frauds as a bar to enforcement of this oral promise because ANSPACH changed her position by moving back into the house in reliance on COLBERT's promises. <p>

65. ANSPACH will suffer the loss of the property, a unique and irreplaceable piece of real estate, due to the trustee's sale proceedings which were initiated on or about August 2, 1995. This unconscionable injury will result from NICHOLSON and COLBERT's failure to uphold their promise to make the payments on the first trust deed and extend the "loan" for three years. ANSPACH was also harmed in the amount of the cost and time of moving back into the house in reliance on COLBERT's promises. <p>

66. ANSPACH seeks specific performance of COLBERT's agreement to extend the "loan" for three years and pay the first for three years. ANSPACH also seeks damages for costs incurred in reliance on COLBERT's promises in an amount to be determined at trial. <p>


FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(Rescission)
(Against All Defendants)<p>

67. Paragraphs 1 through 66 are incorporated by reference and realleged as if set forth herein. <p>

68. ANSPACH trusted that NICHOLSON and his agent, COLBERT, to act with integrity and fidelity because of what she believed at the time was her long-term, close and trusting relationship with NICHOLSON. ANSPACH placed faith in this relationship because NICHOLSON is the father of their child. <p>

69. NICHOLSON and COLBERT used this confidential relationship with ANSPACH to gain an unfair advantage over her by influencing her through their promises that she wouldn't lose the house and their assurances that she should not worry, to sign the "loan" papers for both the $205,000 and the subsequent $476,000 "loan" against her home. <p>

70. When ANSPACH signed these "loan" documents, defendants obtained control and an unfair advantage over ANSPACH which NICHOLSON used to influence her behavior, to punish her, and ultimately to foreclose on her home. Both NICHOLSON and COLBERT were aware that ANSPACH was in an anxious and vulnerable state over her financial, emotional and professional difficulties. ANSPACH feared that she would lose the family home which held great meaning for their son Caleb. By influencing ANSPACH to sign the "loan" documents based on the deceptive promises that the "loans" would never be collected, NICHOLSON and COLBERT took unfair advantage of ANSPACH's distress. NICHOLSON and COLBERT put ANSPACH in this oppressive situation to gain control over her. <p>

71. ANSPACH seeks rescission of the "loan" agreements because they were based on defendants' undue influence amounting to constructive fraud. Plaintiff also seeks damages under C.C. Sec. 3343(a)(3) because by inducing ANSPACH to sign her home over to them through an unrealistic "loan" at an exorbitant interest rate, defendants induced her to part with her property. This inducement caused ANSPACH to refrain from selling the house in 1989, when its value was approximately $1.5 million. ANSPACH suffered consequential damages of approximately $1 million, the exact amount to be proven at trial. ANSPACH also seeks consequential damages for the money and time spent moving in and out of an apartment in Venice, California in her attempts to encourage NICHOLSON and COLBERT to keep their promises. <p>

72. ANSPACH is not required to restore benefits to defendants as a condition of her rescission claim because ANSPACH has suffered damages in excess of the benefits to be restored because of defendants' fraudulent undue influence, thus the court should determine any offsets in its final decree, and defendants' fraudulent actions have made plaintiff ANSPACH financially unable to restore benefits and to require restoration would deny ANSPACH the ability to seek relief. <p>


FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress) (Against All Defendants) <p>

73. Paragraphs 1 through 72 are incorporated by reference and realleged as if set forth herein. <p>

74. Defendants intended to gain control over ANSPACH by creating paper obligations from ANSPACH to PROTEUS that would cause her to lose her family home and cause her extreme emotional distress. On information and belief defendant NICHOLSON has used these transactions to retaliate against ANSPACH for her independence and her independent rearing of their son Caleb and for public statements she has made about the fact that NICHOLSON is Caleb's father. <p>

75. NICHOLSON used the power he obtained over ANSPACH through the "loan" agreement, to manipulate her emotionally and attempt to control ANSPACH's ability to speak publicly about Caleb, due to the constant threat that NICHOLSON could let her lose her home if she made him unhappy. NICHOLSON and COLBERT were aware of ANSPACH's emotionally and financially vulnerable state, yet NICHOLSON called her names, used vulgar language to her, laughed at her and humiliated her for being in the situation NICHOLSON had put her in because of defendants' false promises. COLBERT used this power over ANSPACH to assist NICHOLSON in his plan to manipulate ANSPACH and to make sexual advances toward ANSPACH. The aforementioned conduct of defendants was outrageous, intentional and malicious and was done with wanton and reckless disregard of the consequences to plaintiff. Defendant NICHOLSON intended by his outrageous conduct to retaliate against plaintiff, inter alia, for keeping him out of Caleb's life between 1970 and 1978 and for writing about his relationship to Caleb in Vanity Fair magazine. <p>

76. As a proximate result of defendants' outrageous, willful, wanton and malicious conduct plaintiff has suffered stress-related physical ailments and severe mental and emotional distress. As a result of these injuries plaintiff has suffered special and general damages in an amount according to proof. Because defendants' actions were malicious, oppressive and fraudulent and showed reckless disregard for the consequences they would cause to ANSPACH, plaintiff is also entitled to punitive damages in an amount according to proof. <p>


SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress) (Against All Defendants) <p>

77. Paragraphs 1 through 76 are incorporated by reference and realleged as if set forth herein. <p>

78. Defendants had a confidential relationship with ANSPACH based on the length and closeness of ANSPACH's relationship to NICHOLSON because he is the father of their son. Defendants led ANSPACH to believe that they were acting with integrity and fidelity in her best interests. Defendants' relationship with ANSPACH created a duty to exercise reasonable care in their relations with plaintiff. <p>

79. Defendants knew ANSPACH was in an extremely vulnerable state when she came to them for help. Based on defendants' close relationship to ANSPACH and their awareness of her vulnerabilities, defendants were able to foresee that failure to exercise care in their dealings with plaintiff would cause plaintiff emotional distress. <p>

80. By reason of their wrongful acts, as evidenced herein, plaintiff has suffered stress-related physical harm and extreme emotional distress. As a result, plaintiff has suffered general and special damages in an amount according to proof. <p>

81. As a proximate result of defendants' outrageous, willful, wanton and malicious conduct plaintiff has suffered stress-related physical ailments and severe mental and emotional distress. As a result of these injuries plaintiff has suffered special and general damages in an amount according to proof. Because defendants' actions were malicious, oppressive and fraudulent, and showed reckless disregard for the consequences they would cause to ANSPACH, plaintiff is also entitled to punitive damages in an amount according to proof. <p>


SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

<P>"I could never harm a child or anyone. It's not in my heart. It's not who I am," Jackson said in an interview with Diane Sawyer on ABC's Prime Time Live, according to the complaint. "So what I said is I have got to get out from under this nightmare. All these lies and all of these people coming forth to get paid and all of these tabloid shows. It's lies, lies, lies, lies."</P>

entitled "HIStory Past, Present, and Future - Book 1," including the release of 
audio cassettes, video cassettes, and other like mediums. 

9. Plaintiff is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Defendants sued 
herein as DOES 1 through 300, inclusive, and therefore sues these Defendants 
by such fictitious names. Plaintiff will amend the complaint to allege their true 
names and capacities when ascertained. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and 
thereon alleges that each of the fictitiously named Defendants are responsible in 
some manner for the occurrences herein alleged and that Plaintiff's damages as 
herein alleged were proximately caused by Defendants' conduct. 

10. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that at all times herein 
mentioned each of the Defendants was the agent and employee of each of the 
Defendants, and in doing the things hereinafter alleged, was acting within the 
course and scope of such agency and employment. 

11. Plaintiff is the biological father of [NAME DELETED]. Plaintiff's minor son 
[NAME DELETED] is and at all relevant times has been a minor and was a 
Plaintiff in a prior case against Defendant Jackson. Plaintiff is, and at all times 
relevant herein, was of the Jewish faith. All Defendants were aware that Plaintiff 
was [NAME DELETED]'s father, and a public figure as a result of a relentless 
media campaign instituted by Defendants. 

12. Defendant Jackson is the internationally famous musical entertainer, known 
as the "King of Pop", whose financial empire is so large and pervasive that a 
great number of individuals, including certain other Defendants named herein, 
or unknown, are, in whole or in part, financially dependent upon, and whose 
own financial success and notoriety is in whole or in part dependent upon the 
success and notoriety of Michael Jackson. 

13. In January 1994, Defendant Jackson entered into a confidential agreement to 
settle all claims involving Plaintiff. 

14. In reliance on and in consideration of Defendant Jackson's promises and 
representation set forth in the Agreement, Plaintiff agreed to release Defendant 
Jackson from any and all claims. 

15. On or about January 25, 1994, the public was informed of a mutual 
resolution as set forth in Attachment No. 1, to the underlying [The Boy's Father] 
v. Jackson lawsuit (hereinafter referred to as the "Underlying Action"). 

16. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the public was 
informed that this mutual resolution was in the form of a confidentiality 
agreement. 

17. Defendant Jackson, his related companies and other Defendants, names and 
unnamed, proceeded on a course of conduct to rehabilitate the commercial value 
of Defendant Jackson's image by intentionally breaching the Agreement for the 
purpose of commercial exploitation and financial enrichment. 

18. In January of 1994, and continuing thereafter, Defendant Jackson and Does 
1 through 100, developed, orchestrated, participated and carried out a scheme to 
falsely accuse the minor, [NAME DELETED], in the news media of lying about 
his claims that Defendant Jackson had sexually molested and assaulted the 
minor. Concomitantly, Defendant Jackson, DOES 1 through 100, and each of 
them, falsely accused Plaintiff in the news media of "extortion", and falsely 
accused the Plaintiff of fabricating Defendant Jackson's sexual molestation of 
Plaintiff's minor son [NAME DELETED]. Defendants falsely denied the 
allegations of Plaintiff and his minor son [NAME DELETED]. However, 
Defendants deliberately and maliciously made and disseminated these false 
denials about Plaintiff and his minor son [NAME DELETED] to the news 
media, and others, with the intent of damaging and destroying the reputation of 
Plaintiff and his minor son [NAME DELETED] to divert public attention away 
from the public perception that Defendant Jackson molested Plaintiff's minor 
son [NAME DELETED]. 

19. Each act by the Defendants evolved out of a course of conduct designed to 
protect the above-mentioned Michael Jackson's commercial image and financial 
empire and the Defendants' own personal financial involvement. 

20. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the facts as set 
forth in the Daily News of January 26, 1994, are true as follows: 


". . . The terms of the out-of-court settlement . . . were sealed by a Superior 
Court Judge in Santa Monica . . .". 

". . .Larry Feldman, attorney for the boy, said: 'Hopefully everybody will leave 
him alone and he will get to repair some very, very deep wounds . . .He gets to... 
go and turn on television and not worry about Michael Jackson and him being in 
the news..." 


21. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the facts as set 
forth in the Wall Street Journal of May 19, 1995, are true as follows: 


". . . Sony Corp . . . is set to launch a $30 million dollar marketing campaign for 
Mr. Jackson's new album . . . which will be available on June 20 . . . For Mr. 
Jackson the new release is an opportunity to restore a reputation that was badly 
tarnished last year by an investigation into allegations of child molestation. Sony 
is counting on the double album, which includes 15 greatest hits and 15 new 
songs, to generate sales of at least $500 million dollars world-wide. The 
company will be "disappointed" if the album, which will have a suggested retail 
price of $31.50, fails to sell at least 20 million copies, says Mel Ilberman, 
chairman of Sony Music International. . .". 

". . . Sony is counting on its mammoth marketing campaign to overcome such 
resistance and to lure older buyers. The campaign kicks off on Memorial Day 
Weekend with a four minute promotional trailer that will be shown in more than 
1000 theaters. Later, print ads will appear in USA Today, US Magazine and 
Entertainment Weekly, among others, publications, and television commercials 
will air on most of the morning news shows. Mr. Jackson will also appear on 
Prime Time Live with Diane Sawyer and give a concert performance in 
December broadcast live on Time Warner Inc.'s Home Box Office." 

". . . We expect to sell this album over two Christmas seasons, something we've 
never done before, says Sony's Ilberman. "There will be at least seven songs that 
we will release as singles, which combined with a Michael Jackson tour early 
next year, will take us through Christmas 1996. . .". 

". . . Mr. Jackson's appeal has dropped sharply during the past two years, 
especially among non-black consumers, according to Steven Levitt, president of 
Marketing Evaluations, Inc, a company in Port Washington, New York, that 
tracks the "Q ratings" or popularity of performers, athletes and celebrities. . .". 

". . . He's got a real problem," says Mr. Levitt. "If his album knocks everybody's 
teeth out, Michael Jackson may still have a great success. But if the majority of 
his sales have in the past come from non-whites, it will be tough." 


22. Defendant Michael Jackson and his wife Defendant Lisa Marie Presley, and 
Does 101 through 200, and each of them, made an engagement, and/or entered 
into a contract, agreement, commitment, understanding or other obligation with 
Defendant "ABC" and its Prime Time Live Program," to appear for and give a 
live and unprivileged Interview to discuss the "Underlying Action" violative of 
the parties' agreement. 

23. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the public was not 
informed by Defendant "ABC" that Defendant "ABC" had offered major 
financial inducements and favors to Defendant Jackson to induce him to 
intentionally breach the parties' Confidentiality Agreement. Plaintiff is informed 
and believes, and thereon alleges that as a consequence of Defendant Jackson's 
breach of the terms of the Agreement in appearing on Defendant "ABC's" Prime 
Time Live, Defendant Jackson obtained a financial benefit of a value equal to 
the cost of 40 minutes of advertising on that program, plus Defendant "ABC's" 
agreeing to make 10 showings each of 4 minutes in duration of Defendant 
Jackson's music videos at no cost to Defendant Jackson. 

24. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that as a consequence 
of the inducements offered by Defendant "ABC", which in part caused the 
breach by Defendant Jackson, the market share of "Prime Time Live" soared 
and the ratings went up, causing a financial enrichment to "ABC" in an amount 
unknown at this time to Plaintiff, but which Plaintiff is informed and believes 
and thereon alleges, to be in excess of $60,000,000.00. 

25 In addition to the financial inducements offered by Defendant "ABC", 
Defendant Jackson and Defendants agreed to the Interview in order to redeem 
and rehabilitate his commercially valuable public image in light of the 
averments contained in the "Underlying Action", and to intentionally cast 
Plaintiff and his minor son [NAME DELETED] in a false light violative of 
Defendant Jackson's express obligations pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. 

26. On or about June 14, 1995, Defendant Jackson, and his wife Defendant Lisa 
Marie Presley, participated in and gave a nationally promoted prime-time 
television broadcast, which was advertised as a "no holds barred" Interview of 
Defendant Jackson by Defendant Sawyer on Defendant "ABC's" News Program 
"Prime Time Live" regarding allegations involving the "Underlying Action". 
The conduct of Defendant Jackson and his wife Defendant Lisa Marie Presley 
was expressly barred by the Agreement. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and 
thereon alleges that on June 14, 1995, "Prime Time Live" was viewed by tens of 
millions of people, in the United States, and in various foreign countries. 

27. On June 14, 1995, during the unprivileged Interview, Defendant Jackson 
and his wife Defendant Lisa Marie Presley, in an intentional material breach of 
Defendant Jackson's obligations and promises under the Agreement, discussed 
the claims made in the "Underlying Action", and the allegations made by 
Plaintiff and his minor son [Name Deleted] regarding Defendant Jackson's 
sexual molestation. true and correct copy of a transcript of said Interview is 
attached hereto as Attachment No. 2, and incorporated by reference herein as 
though fully set forth. 

28. During the Interview with Defendant Jackson and his wife Defendant Lisa 
Marie Presley, as set forth in Attachment No. 2, which is incorporated herein by 
reference as though fully set forth, Defendant Sawyer, inter alia, made 
statements and asked questions as follows: 


SAWYER: ". . . and the father had talked to the Jackson camp about money, 
twenty million dollars, according to the Jackson team. This is that father talking 
to someone he knew on tape. (Film of Plaintiff [The Boy's Father] is viewed). 
Plaintiff's words below are shown on the screen: 'If I go through with this, I win 
big time. There is no way that I lose'. . ." 

SAWYER: "I want to be an specific as I can. Did you ever, as this young boy 
said you did, did you ever, sexually engage, fondle, have sexual contact with 
this child or any other child?" 

JACKSON: "Never. Ever. I could never harm a child or anyone. It's not in my 
heart. It's not who I am. And it's not what . . . I'm not even interested in that." 

JACKSON: "Totally outrages (sic). So what I said is I have got to do something 
to get out from under this nightmare. All these lies and all of these people 
coming forth to get paid and all of these tabloid shows. It's lies, lies, lies, lies. So 
what I did, we got together again with my advisors and they advised me, it was 
hands down, a unanimous decision, resolve the case. This could be something 
that could go on for seven years." 

SAYWER:[sic] "How much money--"

JACKSON: "Let's get it behind us."

SAYWER:[sic] "Can you say how much?"

JACKSON: "It's not what the tabloids have printed. It's not all of this crazy 
outlandish money. No, not at all. I mean the terms of the agreement are very 
confidential." 

PRESLEY: "We have been barred to discuss it." 

SAWYER: "The specific terms."

PRESLEY: "The specific terms, the specific amount." 

JACKSON: "The idea just isn't fair what they put me through because there 
wasn't one piece of information that says I did that. And anyway they turned my 
room upside down, they went through all of my books, all of my video tapes, all 
my private things and they found nothing, nothing, nothing that could say 
Michael Jackson did this. Nothing. To this day nothing. Still nothing, nothing, 
nothing, nothing." 

SAWYER: "Nothing, I got nothing. As you may or may not know, we have 
called everyone we can call, we have checked everything we can check. We 
have gone and tried to see if what we heard before is in fact the case. I want to 
ask you about two things. These reports that we've read over and over again that 
in your rooms they found photographs of the young boys..." 

SAWYER: "You've been cleared of all of the charges and we want to make that 
clear. People saying, look, here's a man who is surrounded by things that 
children love. Here is a man who spends an inordinate amount of time with 
these young boys." 

JACKSON: "That's right."

Defendant Jackson's responses, including, but not limited to the above, 
constitute an intentional material breach of the Agreement and were knowingly 
false. 


29. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that as a consequence 
of Defendant Jackson's breach of the terms of the Agreement in appearing on 
Defendant "ABC's" "Prime Time Live" the sales and the play of Defendant 
Jackson's records soared and the total economic benefit from the "Prime Time 
Live" Interview, earned Defendant Jackson, and others, in excess of 
$60,000,000.00. 

30. Defendant Jackson, and Does 201 through 300, and each of them, further 
intentionally materially breached his obligations and promises under the 
provisions of the Agreement in that Defendant Jackson, in conjunction with 
Defendant Sony, wrote and caused to be distributed to the public for sale a 
certain musical composition entitled "HIStory Past, Present, and Future - Book 
1" ("HIStory"), including, but not limited to, any and all video cassettes and 
other like mediums. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that 
the title of the album, "HIStory," and the recordings of the musical compositions 
contained therein, by innuendo, is Defendant Jackson's expression of his 
feelings of ill will regarding Plaintiff and his minor son [NAME DELETED]. 
Defendant Jackson has used, and continues to use, the "HIStory" album and the 
songs therein as a means to commercially exploit the "Underlying Action." 
Defendant Jackson made derogatory, harmful, malicious and fraudulent public 
statements in the lyrics of the "HIStory" album, including, but not limited to the 
song entitled "They Don't Care About Us", Defendant Jackson's lyrics, inter alia, 
state: 


"Jew me, sue me, everybody do me/Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white 
me; 

"Tell me about what has become of my life? 

"Children who love me, I'm a victim of police brutality/ I'm tired of being a 
victim of fate. . ." 

"Tell me, what has become of my rights/ Am I in reason because you know me, 
defamation from speak free liberty (no, please)" 

"I'm tired of being a victim machine, they're throwin' me in a class with a bad 
name . . ." 

In the song entitled "This Time Around", Defendant Jackson's lyrics, inter alia, 
state: 

" . . . This time around, I'll bet though you really wanna fix me . . . you're makin' 
me sick, though you really wanna get me . . Somebody's out, somebody's out to 
get me, they really wanna fix me, hit me . . . I'm takin' no shit though you really 
wanna get me . . ." 

" . . . He really thought, he really had a hold on me, he really thought, he really 
could control me . . ." 

"I'm takin shit though you really wanna fix . . . Somebody's out, somebody's out 
to use me, they really wanna use me, they falsely accused me . . ." 

"Somebody's out to use me/ They really want to use me, they falsely accuse 
me;" 

In the song entitled "Money", Defendant Jackson's lyrics inter alia, state: 

"If you show me the cash then I will take it/ If you tell me to cry, then I will 
fake it/ Lie for it, Spy for it, kill for it, die for it" 

"So you gonna trust what I say is just in the Devil's game... They don't care, they 
do me for the money, they don't care, they use me for the money . . ." 

". . . I'll never betray or deceive you me friend, but if you . . . you sue it for the 
money, want your pot of gold, need the micas touch, but you sell your soul, 
because your God is such . . . are you infected with the same disease of lust, 
glutony, and greed. The watch the ones with the widest smiles . . ." 

In the song entitled "They Used Me For The Money/They Don't Care" and in 
the song entitled "2 Bad" Defendant Jackson's lyrics, inter alia, state: 

"I'm tired of you hustling me"

In the song entitled "D.S.", Defendant Jackson's lyrics, inter alia, state: 

"They wanna get my ass/ Dead or alive/ You know he really tried to take me/ 
Down by surprise/ 

I bet he missioned with the CIA/ He don't do half what he say" 

"Dom Sheldon is a cold man . . ."

"He out shock in every single way/ He'll stop at nothing just to get his political 
say/ He think he bad cause he's BSTA/ I bet he never had a social life anyway" 

"You think he brother with the KKK?/ I know his mother never taught him right 
anyway/ He want your vote just to remain TA/ He don't do half what he say" 
"Does he send letters to the FBI?/ Did he say to either do it or die" 

And, in the song entitled "Tabloid Junky", Defendant Jackson's lyrics, inter alia, 
state: 

"It's slander, you say it like a sword, but your pen you torture me . . . Just 
because you read it in a magazine, or me it on a T.V. screen, don't make factual/ 
They say he's homosexual . . . it's slander,. . ." 


31. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the facts as set 
forth in the Entertainment Weekly of June 16, 1995, are true as follows: 


". . . Sony Entertainment, which signed a much-hyped deal potentially worth $1 
billion with Jackson in 1991, is taking no chances. Still hoping to salvage its 
investment in the scandal-scarred singer, Sony is reportedly spending 30 million 
to promote the album in a publicity megablitz. The $7 million video of 
"Scream", Jackson's duet with sister Janet Jackson, will debut June 13, the day 
before he and Lisa Marie sit down for an hour-long interview with Diane 
Sawyer on "ABC's" Prime Time Live. Sony execs hope to keep the album alive 
through Christmas 1996 by gradually releasing at least seven singles. . .' People 
like Michael or Madonna constantly resurrect themselves. The entertainment 
industry in pursuit of the almighty dollar follows their lead'. . .". 


32. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the facts as set 
forth in the Washington Post of June 18, 1995, are true as follows: 


". . . With History, Michael is back with a vengeance that is both personal and 
professional. As the title implies, this is Jackson's side of the story, reduced to 
attacks on the media ("Stop presurrin' me") and pleas for pity ("Have you seen 
my childhood?"). . .". 

". . . It's also an example of masterfully manipulative marketing that includes a 
$4 million theatrical teaser for a $10 million two disc album featuring 15 new 
songs and 15 remastered hits, a $7 million video, and an 18-month, $30 million 
promotional campaign by Sony, a video "History" and last Wednesday's "Prime 
Time Live" interview with Diane Sawyer. . . " 

". . . On Prime Time Live, Jackson again passionately denied the molestation 
charges, insisting he would never 'harm' a child. Sawyer did not push on any 
issue and made two errors of fact: indicating that the charges arose out of an 
extortion attempt by the boy's father in exchange for his son's silence 
(prosecutors cleared the father and, as part of the settlement, Jackson agreed to 
withdraw the extortion allegations). Sawyer also said that the case was now 
closed, but the Santa Barbara District Attorneys' Office has said it will remain 
open until the expiration of the statute of limitations on child molestation 
charges - in 1999 . . .". 


33. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the facts as set 
forth in the New York Daily News of June 19, 1995, are true as follows: 


". . . In 11 out of 15 new Michael Jackson songs on History. . . the singer uses 
his must as payback to the world of accusers. . . This broken record effect 
wouldn't be so bad if the complaints were new to Jackson. But he's been playing 
some kind of misunderstood victim for many years. . .". 


34. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the facts as set 
forth in the New York Times of June 19, 1995, are true as follows: 


". . .Semantically, there's a clear distinction being made between the harshly 
pejorative 'kike' on one hand, and black or white on the other. Syntactically, 
'Jew' here is a verb, synonymous with sue, what Jews are presumed to do, like 
some aggressive lawyers much in the news and some with whom Mr. Jackson 
may have lately have had some dealings. If he had simply acknowledged that 
the words were ill chosen, his response would not have been so disturbing. 
Instead, he sought to exculpate himself in terms that raise more questions than 
they put to rest. "... In the interview with Diane Sawyer. . . he exonerates his 
song by putting it back in the context of - Himself...' It's not anti-Semitic 
because I am not a racist person'. . . The argument goes: 'If I am not racist, then 
my words, even though they are anti-Semitic, are not directed against Jews'. . . . 
It seems strange that Michael Jackson should never have observed how 
regularly the most vicious stereotyping is prefaced with the claim that the 
speaker is not racist. . . But Mr. Jackson has gone one step further. By 
maintaining that he is not the attacker but the accused and attacked, he has 
elevated himself to being not just a victim but the supreme victim - a visible 
emblem of all who are marginalized and excluded... Victim and savior, Michael 
Jackson . . . sees himself as the crucified Lord . . . But being godlike has its 
dangers: He who is all things, who occupies every margin - the voice of 
everyone - has the perfect understanding that insures perfect forgiveness. In the 
eye of the Lord, we are all His children, and from His elevated perspective there 
is no distinction between black or white, skinhead and Jew... But for us down 
here, for us mortals, such distinctions may be a matter of life and death. God 
may forgive a white skinhead, but a black or a Jew, who is his victim, cannot 
afford to . . .". 


35. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the facts as set 
forth in Time Magazine of June 26, 1995, are true as follows: 


". . . Barely a song goes by without some reference to his new found status as 
the world's greatest victim . . .". 


36. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the facts as set 
forth in Hollywood Reporter of July 13, 1995, are true as follows: 


". . . Michael Jackson turned over a revised recording of 'They Don't Care About 
Us' to Sony's Epic Records on Wednesday, eliminating the anti-Semitic phrases 
'Jew me' and 'Kike me', a source said . . . In deciding to re record the song he 
said: 'I acknowledge that I seriously offended some people, which was never my 
intention, and for that I am deeply sorry. I have come to understand over the 
past days, that these words are considered anti-Semitic'. . .". 


37. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the facts as set 
forth in Vanity Fair issue of September 1995, are true as follows: 


". . . On June 14, some 60 million people tuned in to see Diane Sawyer 
interview Michael Jackson and his bride, Lisa Marie Presley, on "ABC" New's 
Prime Time Live. The widely advertised 'no holds barred' interview, the 
capstone of a $30. million marketing campaign for Jackson's new album, 
History . . .". 

" . . . When the show ended, many with detailed knowledge of the case were 
appalled by what "ABC" News had allowed Jackson to get away with, and by 
Sawyer's . . . inability to follow up within the format dictated by the Jackson 
forces. . .". 

" . . . Controversy raged for days over the way "ABC" had bent news standards 
to accommodate Jackson's many demands, not to mention the outcry over the 
cruel revenge tone... Sawyer . . . and the Prime Time team, in giving no one but 
Jackson a say, left crucial areas unreported or incorrectly reported: for example, 
that Jackson had been 'cleared' of all charges. . . 'You can't go into the bedroom 
[at Neverland]. It's locked and alarmed and the floor is electronically wired,' 
says DA Sneddon . . .". 

". . . Even Jackson's camp admits he slept in the same bed with the boy all those 
nights . . . the boy himself, according to sources close to the case, was 
considering going into the witness protection program - such was his fear of the 
retribution he would suffer by  publicly alleging that Michael Jackson was a 
pedophile. . .". 

". . . 'Regarding the markings', Sneddon says: 'his statement on TV is untrue and 
incorrect and non consistent with the evidence in the case.' Others familiar with 
the evidence are more forthcoming. They say there are definite markings on 
Jackson's genital area, including discoloration on his testicles . . . The boy lives 
with his stepmother... He continues to have a relationship with his father, who 
was accused by Jackson's side of extortion but whom authorities declined to 
prosecute, saying there wasn't enough evidence - another fact not mentioned by 
Diane Saywer[sic]. . .". 

". . . Then it was learned that "ABC" had swapped the airing of 10 TV 
commercials for Jackson's new album ads worth between $300,000 and $1.5 
million - for rights to 'future Michael Jackson music videos'. . . According to the 
Bloomberg Business News Service, which broke the story, the commercials ran 
in the week between Sawyer's interview and the release of the album. . .". 

". . . A producer for one network told me: 'It's difficult to pretend there was not 
quid pro quo in the "ABC" deal. Jackson's people approached a bunch of us.' 
Basically they said: 'Come back to us with a proposition, and not just what you 
can do with your news division - that is not enough' . . .". " . . .'I have no idea 
what the purpose of her show is', District Attorney Sneddon wondered, 
somewhat taken aback after having spent three hours on a Saturday afternoon 
helping to prime one of Sawyer's producers. 'Is it the Evening News or Hard 
Copy?'. . . Whatever it was, 60 million Americans and untold millions around 
the world got something less than the truth . . .". 


38. All acts by Defendant Jackson herein alleged were maliciously intended to 
cause Plaintiff great harm and suffering directly and indirectly by Plaintiff 
observing and caring for the suffering of Plaintiff's minor son [REDCATED] 
because of Defendants' continual disclosure of false facts regarding the 
"Underlying Action" through Defendants' use of the media. Since January of 
1994, Plaintiff and his minor son [NAME DELETED] have received numerous 
death threats from Defendant Jackson's fans, who believe Defendants' claim that 
Plaintiff is an extortionist. The continual denial by Defendant Jackson, and 
others, of the truth of the facts of the "Underlying Action", and in the continual 
playing of his album HIStory, (the allegorical denial of the true facts), causes 
continuing emotional suffering by Plaintiff who is also commercially exploited 
by Defendant Jackson. Plaintiff continues to suffer damages and will suffer 
damages in the future in an amount presently unascertainable. Defendants' acts 
as set forth in the General Allegations should be enjoined forthwith to prevent 
Plaintiff's further harm caused by Defendants' violation of the Agreement. 


FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST DEFENDANT JACKSON AND 
DOES 1 THROUGH 100. (For Breach of Contract) 

39. Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference all of the paragraphs of the 
General Allegations as though fully set forth herein. 

40. Since January of 1994, Plaintiff has performed all covenants and conditions 
to be performed on his part under and pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. 

41. Defendant Jackson, and Does 1 through 100, and each of them, have 
materially breached the Agreement as set forth herein. 

42. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant Jackson's, and others' material 
breach of the Agreement as herein alleged for commercial exploitation and 
financial enrichment, Plaintiff demands all economic benefits gained by 
Defendant Jackson and other Defendants from the commercial exploitation of 
the facts of the "Underlying Action" in an amount in excess of $60,000,000.00. 

43. As an additional direct and proximate result of Defendant Jackson's and 
others' material breach of the agreement as herein alleged, and because of the 
need to repair the reputation of the Plaintiff, Plaintiff seeks the equitable remedy 
of an order to allow him to publish and cause to be distributed to the public for 
sale a certain musical composition entitled "EVANstory." This album will 
include such songs as: "D.A. Reprised": "You Have No Defense (For My 
Love)"; "Duck Butter Blues"; "Truth"; and other songs. 


SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST DEFENDANT JACKSON, AND 
DOES 1 THROUGH 100. (For Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress) 

44. Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference all of the paragraphs of the 
General Allegations, and the allegations of all prior Causes of Action as though 
fully set forth herein. 

45. From January 1994, to and including the present, Defendant Jackson and 
Does 1 through 100, and each of them, made continuous and intentional public 
false statements about Plaintiff's activities regarding the "Underlying Action", 
caused the Plaintiff to suffer severe and extreme emotional distress. 

46. The conduct of Defendant Jackson and others as herein described was done 
with the intent to cause, or with reckless disregard to cause, Plaintiff severe and 
extreme emotional distress. Such extreme and outrageous conduct exceeds all 
bounds of decency, and is of a nature which was and is specifically calculated to 
cause, and did cause Plaintiff to suffer extreme and severe emotional distress. 
Plaintiff is therefore entitled to recover damages according to proof. 

47. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that in doing the 
things alleged herein, Defendants Jackson and others acted fraudulently,

DEFENDANT SAWYER AND DOES 101 THROUGH 200 (For Negligence) 

61. Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference all paragraphs of the General 
Allegations and the Allegations of all prior Causes of Action, as though fully set 
forth herein. 

62. Defendant "ABC", Defendant Saywer[sic], and Does 101 through 200, and 
each of them, had a duty of due care not to conduct the Interview of Defendant 
Jackson because Defendants stated during the Interview that they had called 
everyone they could call and checked everything they could check and thus had 
knowledge that the well-publicized Agreement prevented Defendant Jackson 
from appearing on television and discussing any matters relating to the 
"Underlying Action". Defendant "ABC" and Defendant Sawyer knew or should 
have known that Defendant Jackson would violate terms of the Agreement and 
make false and defamatory statements about Plaintiff in any Interview 
conducted by the aforesaid Defendants regarding the "Underlying Action". 
Defendant "ABC" also knew that Defendant Jackson had not been cleared of all 
criminal charges. Defendant "ABC" further knew that the Santa Barbara District 
Attorney's Office had a continuing investigation which would stay open until the 
statute of limitations had run on the acts of Defendant Jackson. 

63. In doing the acts herein alleged, the Defendants, and each of them, so 
negligently, carelessly, and recklessly performed their duties in permitting 
Defendant Jackson to be Interviewed and to falsely discuss matters relating to 
the Underlying Agreeing and Defendant Jackson's relationship with Plaintiff's 
minor son [NAME DELETED].

WIFE DEFENDANT LISA MARIE PRESLEY AND DEFENDANT SAWYER

65. Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference all of the paragraphs of the 
General Allegations of all the prior Causes of Action, as though fully set forth 
herein. 

66. Defendant Jackson, his wife Defendant Lisa Marie Presley, Defendant 
"ABC", Does 101 through 200, and each of them, conspired to intentionally 
interfere with the Agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant Jackson. Plaintiff 
is informed and believes and thereon alleges that this unlawful conspiracy was 
an agreement, whether oral or written, between the conspirators, express or 
implied, to intentionally breach the Agreement entered into by Plaintiff and 
Defendant Jackson by allowing Defendant Jackson to discuss matters relating to 
the "Underlying Action" on "ABC's" "Prime Time Live." 

67. The purpose of Defendants' conspiring to breach Plaintiff and Defendant 
Jackson's agreement was to enhance the commercial value and image of 
Defendant Jackson. The conspirators wanted to focus public attention on 
Defendant Jackson by making Defendant Jackson appear to be a victim of an 
extortion plot perpetrated by Plaintiff. The conspirators intended to influence the 
public's perception of Defendant Jackson as a victim to induce sympathy in the 
public to cause the public to purchase Defendant Jackson's music album 
"HIStory" and video, thus exploiting Defendant Jackson's unlawful acts for 
commercial gain. The attempt to induce sympathy was disguised in the 
Interview by asking the manufactured lingering questions as to Defendant 
Jackson's guilt, or in the words of Defendant Saywer: "unequaled injustice and 
hell", as the victim of the Plaintiff. 

68. As a proximate result of Defendants' wrongful acts pursuant to the 
conspiracy herein alleged, on June 14, 1995, Defendant Jackson, Defendant 
Presley, Defendant "ABC", Does 101-200, knowingly participated in the 
conspiracy herein alleged by virtue of Defendant Jackson's appearance on

Agreement on his part to be performed as herein alleged. 

70. As a further direct and proximate result of the wrongful acts pursuant to the 
conspiracy herein alleged, Plaintiff has been generally damaged as set forth 
herein. 

71. Defendants, and each of them, did the things herein alleged oppressively and 
maliciously entitling Plaintiff punitive damages in an amount according to law.

DENNIS G. MERENBACH, Esq.
Attorney for Plaintiff,
[THE BOY'S FATHER]


We wish to jointly announce a mutual resolution to the [The Boy's Father] v. 
Jackson lawsuit. As you are aware, the Plaintiff has alleged certain acts of 
impropriety by Mr. Jackson, and, from the inception of those allegations, Mr. 
Jackson has strongly denied he engaged in any misconduct. However, the 
emotional trauma and strain on the respective parties have caused both parties to 
reflect on the wisdom of continuing in this litigation. 

The Plaintiff has agreed the lawsuit should be resolved, and while Mr. Jackson 
continues to maintain his innocence, he withdraws any previous allegation of 
extortion. This will allow. the parties to get on with their lives in a more positive 
and productive manner. 

Much of the suffering these parties have been put through was caused by the 
publicity surrounding this case. We jointly request that members of the press 
allow the parties to close this chapter in their lives with dignity so that the 
healing process may begin.

<P>A Louisiana woman left paralyzed by a robber who shot her
after watching "Natural Born Killers" claims Hollywood is partly to
blame. Patsy Byers was working at the Time Saver store when 18-
year-old Sarah Edmondson came in, shot her and stole money from
the cash register. Edmondson later told police that she and her
boyfriend Benjamin Darrus took drugs and went on a shooting spree
after repeatedly watching the Oliver Stone movie. In her lawsuit,
Byers' claims Stone, Warner Bros. and several other defendants knew
or should have known that the movie "would cause and inspire people
such as the defendants to commit crimes." The case has pitted best-
selling novelist John Grisham against Stone. Grisham has urged
lawsuits against the movie, claiming it glamorizes casual mayhem and
bloodlust. Grisham was friends with Bill Savage, a businessman
fatally shot by Edmondson and Darrus.

II.

On March 8, 1995 in Ponchatoula, Louisiana, Sarah Edmondson and
Benjamin Darrus acting together shot and seriously wounded Patsy
Ann Byers during an armed robbery of a Time Saver convenience
store in Ponchatoula, Louisiana.

IIA.
Upon information and belief, Sarah Edmondson and Benjamin Darrus
shot Patsy Ann Byers with a weapon they obtained from a cabin
owned by Sarah's parents, James E. Edmondson and Suzanne
Edmondson.

IIB.
Upon information and belief, defendants James E. Edmondson and
Suzanne Edmondson were insured by one or more insurance
companies, more particularly, but not exclusively, the companies
hereinabove referred to as USAA.

IIC.
Upon information and belief, defendants Benjamin Darrus and Sarah
Edmondson, went upon a crime spree culminating in the shooting and
permanent injury to Patsy Ann Byers as a result of seeing and
becoming inspired by the movie "Natural Born Killers" produced,
directed and distributed by the Hollywood defendants.

III.

Patsy Ann Byers' lawful husband in Lonnie Wayne Byers. She has
two minor children, Jacob Eugene Byers and Joshua Noah Byers, and
one major child, Ladonna Marie Byers.

IV.

As a result of the shooting, Patsy Ann Byers was hospitalized in
Houston, Texas paralyzed from the chest down and on a breathing
machine. She has suffered grievous injuries necessitating astronomical
medical bills and complete and permanent disability.

V.

The incident sued on herein is inexplicable without resort to the
presumption of negligence and the applicability of the doctrine of res
ipsa loquitur in view of the fact that the defendants, Sarah Edmondson
and Benjamin Darrus shot Patsy Ann Byers with no remorse and left
her to die on the floor of the convenience store.

V(A).
Defendant, Sarah Edmondson is further negligent more particularly,
but not exclusively, in shooting Patsy Ann Byers, in failing to attempt
to obtain for her medical assistance, and for such other negligence as
will be learned during discovery and shown at trial of this matter.

V(B).
Defendant Benjamin Darrus is further negligent, more particularly but
not exclusively, in accompanying Sarah Edmondson upon her
shooting spree, in encouraging her to engage in same, in assisting her,
in driving away, in failing to obtain medical assistance for Patsy Ann
Byers, and for such other negligence as will be learned during
discovery and shown at trial of this matter.

V(C).
James E. Edmondson and Suzanne Edmondson are negligent, more
particularly, but not exclusively, in allowing a loaded weapon to be
accessible to defendants, Sarah Edmondson and Benjamin Darrus,
particularly in light of their knowledge of the wild recklessness and
potential for danger to others each presented, and for such other
negligence as shall be learned during discovery and shown at trial of
this matter.

V(D).
USAA are liable as the insurers of James E. Edmondson and Suzanne
Edmondson who provided coverage for liability of the nature asserted
herein against such defendant. Said insurance inures to the benefit of
plaintiffs under the provisions of Louisiana Direct Action Statute, La.
R.S. 22:655, entitling plaintiffs to maintain this direct action against
said defendant insurer, and thereby rendering said defendant insurer
liable, in solido, with defendants, for damages as sued for herein.

V(E).
All of the Hollywood defendants are liable, more particularly, but not
exclusively for, distributing a film which they knew or should have
known would cause and inspire people such as defendants, Sarah
Edmondson and Benjamin Darrus, to commit crimes such as the
shooting of Patsy Ann Byers, and for producing and distributing a
film which glorified the type of violence defendants committed against
Patsy Ann Byers by treating individuals who commit such violence as
celebrities and heros, as well as for such other negligence as will be
learned during discovery and shown at trial of this matter.

VI.

Patsy Ann Byers is entitled to recover from the defendants for their
joint negligence and actions as follows:

A.Past, present, and future loss of income; B.Past, present, and
future medical expense; C.Past, present, and future loss of enjoyment
of life; D.Past, present, and future mental and physical pain and
suffering; E.Past, present and future disability and scarring.


VII.

Lonnie Wayne Byers, individually and as tutor of the minor children,
Jacob Eugune Byers and Joshua Noah Byers, and Ladonna Marie
Byers are entitled to loss of consortium, society and friendship, as
well as loss of support from their wife and mother respectfully.

VIII.

Patsy Ann Byers and Lonnie Wayne Byers, individually and as tutor
of the minor children, Jacob Eugene Byers and Joshua Noah Byers,
and Ladonna Marie Byers, in accordance with Louisiana Code of Civil
Procedure Article 2315 et seq., assert action against the defendants,
Sarah Edmondson, Benjamin Darrus, James E. Edmondson, Suzanne
Edmondson, USAA Casualty Insurance Company, United Services
Automobile Association, USAA General Indemnity Company,
Warner Home Video, Inc., Warner Brothers, Inc., Time Warner
Entertainment Company, L.P., Regency Enterprises, Alcor Films,
J.D. Productions, and Oliver Stone, in solido, seeking all such
damages as may be reasonable in the premises, including damages for
loss of income and ability to earn same, pain and suffering, grief,
mental anguish, loss of future support, loss of enjoyment of life and
for loss of consortium, service and society.

IX.

The amount sued upon is above the amount necessary for a jury trial
under the Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure.

X.

Petitioners are without funds and are unable to pay the costs of court
in advance, or as they accrue, or to furnish security and, therefore,
desire that they be permitted to proceed forma pauperis.

WHEREFORE, PETITIONERS PRAY, that they be allowed to
proceed in forma pauperis, for Leave of Court to file this amended
petition, and that defendants be served with a copy of this amended
petition, and cited to appear and answer same, and after due
proceedings had, that there be judgment in favor of plaintiffs, Patsy
Ann Byers and Lonnie Wayne Byers, individually and as tutor of their
minor children, Jacob Eugene Byers and Joshua Noah Byers, and one
major child, Ladonna Marie Byers, and against defendants, Sarah
Edmondson and Benjamin Darrus, James E. Edmondson, Suzanne

these proceedings, and for all general and equitable relief.

<P>Larson, the creator of "Rent," the Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize winning rock opera, will never write another song because of two New York hospitals' malpractice, according to this March 11, 1996 complaint filed by Larson's estate. Larson died Jan. 25, a few hours after the final dress rehearsal for his play. Larson went to Cabrini Medical Center a few days before, complaining of stomach pain. Doctors took x-rays, told him it was something he had eaten, and pumped his stomach. Two days later, Larson went to St. Vincent's Hospital with the same complaint. Doctors took more x-rays and said he had a virus. He later died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm. His estate claims the aneurysm should have been detected in the x-rays.</P>

ATTORNEY'S VERIFICATION

DAVID L. TABACK, an attorney admitted to practice in the Courts of the State of New York, shows that deponent is the attorney for the plaintiff herein; that deponent has read the foregoing COMPLAINT and know the contents thereof; that the same is true to deponent's own knowledge, except as to the matters therein stated to be alleged upon information and belief, and that as to those matters, deponent believes it to be true.

COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES

JEFFREY KATZENBERG,

Plaintiff

v.

THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY and
DOES 1 through 20,

Defendants.

CASE NO. BC 147 864

DEFENDANT THE WALT DISNEY
COMPANY'S ANSWER TO
COMPLAINT

DISCOVERY CUTOFF: Not Set
MOTION CUTOFF: Not Set
TRIAL DATE: Not Set

Defendant the Walt Disney Company ("Disney"), for itself and for no
other defendant, hereby responds to the complaint filed by Plaintiff
Jeffrey Katzenberg ("Katzenberg") and admits, denies and alleges as
follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. In 1984, Jeffrey Katzenberg commenced employment at Disney
pursuant to a written employment agreement in which, among other
things, Disney agreed to pay Katzenberg an annual bonus based
upon motion picture and television product produced during his
employment. As of 1988, however, Katzenberg had not yet earned
any such bonus given the performance of the product produced.
Nonetheless, during those years, Disney paid Katzenberg millions of
dollars in discretionary bonuses.

2. In 19988, Katzenberg and Disney began to negotiate a new
employment agreement, including a substantial increase in
Katzenberg's stock options and salary. Although Disney wanted the
new employment agreement to cover a fixed term through September
1996, Katzenberg insisted upon an option to terminate his
employment two years earlier. Disney agreed to that request with two
provisos: (1) Disney had to have the same option; and (2) if
Katzenberg's employment ended in 1994, rather than in 1996, he
would not receive, as he otherwise would have, any bonus based on
the future performance of motion pictures and television programs
produced during his employment. Accordingly, the 1988 contract
specifically provides that if Katzenberg elects to leave Disney's
employ in 1994, as he did, he would be entitled only to whatever
bonus he may have earned through 1994. He would not receive any
bonus based upon income from the FUTURE performance of Disney
films and television programs.

3. In August 1993, having been expressly reminded of the
consequences of his decision, Katzenberg nonetheless notified
Disney of his intention to end his employment in September 1994. In
accordance with that election, Katzenberg left Disney's employ in
September, foregoing any bonus based on the future performance of
Disney motion pictures and television programs produced during his
employment, in favor of what Katzenberg contemplated would be
even more profitable and prestigious entrepreneurial opportunities. At
the time of his departure, Disney paid Katzenberg the full amount of
bonus compensation due to him and accelerated and paid him
substantial deferred bonuses that would not have been payable for
several years.

4. Having made the choice to leave Disney in 1994, knowing the
consequences, Katzenberg is simply not entitled to the enormous
sums of money he now demands.

ANSWER TO FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

5. Referring to paragraph 1, Disney denies the allegations thereof,
except Disney admits that (a) Plaintiff has been a motion picture and
television executive and a resident of Los Angeles County; (b)
Disney is a Delaware corporation; and (c) Disney affiliates and
subsidiaries do business in Los Angeles County and elsewhere as
producers and distributors of motion pictures and television
programs, as owners and operators of theme parks and as proprietors
of other businesses.

6. Referring to paragraph 2, Disney denies the allegations thereof for
lack of sufficient information or belief.

7. Referring to paragraph 3, Disney denies the allegations thereof,
except admits that in or about October 1984, Disney and Katzenberg
entered into a written employment agreement (the "1984 contract")
pursuant to which, among other things, Katzenberg was given the
title of Chairman of the Walt Disney Studios. Disney further and
affirmatively alleges that the 1984 Contract is the best evidence of its
contents.

8. Referring to paragraph 4, Disney denies the allegations thereof,
except admits that prior to the expiration of the 1984 Contract,
Disney and Katzenberg executed a new written employment
agreement dated as of October 1, 1988 (the "1988 Contract"), which
provides for an employment term ending on September 30, 1994.
Disney further and affirmatively alleges that the 1988 Contract is the
best evidence of its contents, and specifically provides, unlike the
1984 Contract, for an automatic two-year extension of its term (until
September 30, 1996) unless either Katzenberg or Disney elected not
to extend the term (the"Opt-Out Provision").

9. Referring to Paragraph 5, Disney denies the allegations thereof,
and further and affirmatively alleges that the 1984 and the 1988
Contracts are the best evidence of their respective contents. Disney
admits that the 1988 Contract contains provisions respecting the
potential payment to Katzenberg of an "Incentive Bonus," but denies
that the "Incentive Bonus" provided for in the 1988 Contract (the
"1988 Bonus") is like the "Incentive Bonus" contained in the 1984
Contract (the "1984 Bonus") and alleges that the 1984 Bonus and the
1988 Bonus provisions are, in respects determinative of this action,
materially different from one another. Most critically (and
conspicuously omitted from Katzenberg's Complaint), the 1988
Contract (at Para. 9 thereof) contains express provisions that limit
Disney's obligations with respect to the 1988 Bonus if Katzenberg
elects, as he did, to cut short by two years the term of his
employment under the 1988 Contract. In particular, the 1988
Contract, by its present terms, limits Disney's obligation under such
circumstances to the payment of the 1988 Bonus based only upon
income earned during the years PRIOR to the expiration of
Katzenberg's employment (i.e., September 30, 1994). Disney
further and affirmatively alleges that when Katzenberg elected to
terminate his employment in 1994, he was fully aware of these
contract provisions and accepted the consequences.

10. Referring to paragraph 6, Disney alleges that the allegations
thereof constitute evidentiary matter which is neither relevant nor
material to the issues or claims set forth in the Complaint and that no
response to such allegations is therefore necessary as a matter of law.
If any response is necessary, Disney denies the allegations of
Paragraph 6.

11. Referring to paragraph 7, Disney denies the allegations thereof
and, in particular, denies that the interpretation of the 1984 Bonus
and the 1988 Bonus alleged therein is correct or was of the essence
of either the 1984 Contract or the 1988 Contract. Disney further and
affirmatively alleges that the 1988 Contract is the best evidence of its
contents.

12. Referring to paragraph 8, Disney denies the allegations thereof
except admits that Disney's fiscal year runs from October 1 to
September 30.

13. Referring to Paragraph 9, Disney alleges that the allegations
thereof constitute evidentiary which is neither relevant nor material to
the issues or claims set forth in the Complaint and that no response to
such allegations is therefore necessary as a matter of law. If any
response is necessary, Disney alleges that its filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for the years 1984 through
1994 are accurate. Except as so expressly alleged, Disney denies the
remaining allegations of paragraph 9.

14. Referring to paragraph 10, Disney alleges that the 9188 contract
is the best evidence of its contents. Disney admits that Katzenberg
had the right to give notice that the 1988 Agreement would expire on
September 30, 1994 and would not automatically be extended for an
additional two years. Disney further admits and alleges that on or
about August 31, 1993, Katzenberg provided Disney with such
notice and, as a result, Katzenberg's employment expired on
September 30, 1994. Except as so expressly admitted and alleged,
Disney denies the remaining allegations of Paragraph 10.

15. Referring to paragraph 1.1, Disney admits, without prejudice,
and based upon its present information and belief, that Katzenberg
has discharged his duties under the 1988 Contract and alleges that
Disney, exceeding its contractual obligations, has more than fully
compensated Katzenberg for the performance of such duties in cash,
stock and other consideration. Disney further admits that the 1988
Contract continues to impose certain obligations on Katzenberg
notwithstanding its expiration. Except as so expressly admitted and
alleged, Disney denies the remaining allegations of paragraph 11.

16. Referring to paragraph 12, Disney denies the allegations thereof.

17. Referring to paragraph 13, Disney alleges that any dispute
between the parties as to the determination of the present value of the
estimated future "Adjusted Operating Income" from "Eligible
Product" (should that issue ever become relevant) must be arbitrated
as expressly agreed by the parties in the 1988 Contract. Except as so
expressly alleged, Disney denies the remaining allegations of
paragraph 13 and specifically denies that Katzenberg has sustained
any damage as a direct or proximate result of any alleged act or
omission by Disney.

ANSWER TO SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

18. Referring to paragraph 14, Disney incorporates by reference the
admissions, denials and allegations of paragraphs 1 through 17,
inclusive, of this answer.

19. Referring to paragraph 15, Disney alleges that the 1984 Contract
and the 1988 Contract are the best evidence of their respective
contents. Except as so expressly alleged, Disney denies the
remaining allegations of paragraph 15.

20. Referring to paragraph 16, Disney denies the allegations thereof.

FIRST AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
(Failure to State a Cause of Action)

21. The Complaint, and each purported cause of action alleged
therein, fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
against Disney.

SECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
(Contractual Arbitration - Lack of Jurisdiction)

22. Pursuant to the 1988 Contract, any dispute as to the present value
of the estimated future "Adjusted Operating Income" from "Eligible
Product" is subject to mandatory arbitration in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association as modified by the 1988 Contract. Accordingly, this
Court lacks jurisdiction over any such dispute and all factual or legal
issues incidental thereto.

THIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE
(In the Alternative)

23. In the alternative, should the Court determine that, at the time of
contracting, Katzenberg and Disney did not share a common intent
with respect to the effect of Katzenberg's exercise of the Opt-Out
Provision on the 1988 Bonus, then there was no mutual assent
("meeting of the minds") on that issue, and Disney has no obligation
to Katzenberg as to any disputed portion of the 1988 Bonus.

WHEREFORE, Disney prays for judgment as follows:

1. That Katzenberg take nothing by his Complaint and that the same
be dismissed with prejudice:

2. that Katzenberg's improper prayer for attorney's fees pursuant to
the inapplicable Code of Civil Procedure Section 128.5 be stricken
and summarily denied:

3. For Disney's costs of suit incurred herein; and

4. For such other, further or different relief as the Court may deem
just and proper.

<P>Two longtime associates of Harry Helmsley are suing the real estate tycoon and his wife, Leona. Irving Schneider and Alvin Schwartz claim that since Harry Helmsley's physical and mental condition deteriorated to the point where he could no longer play an active role in the management of his businesses, Leona Helmsley has blocked payments due them under their lifetime employment contracts. They also allege that Leona Helmsley has "looted" the Helmsley/Spear concern in which they are minority shareholders, transferring assets to other components of Helmsleys businesses.</P>

SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
COUNTY OF NEW YORK

IRVING SCHNEIDER and ALVIN SCHWARTZ,

Plaintiffs,

against

LEONA HELMSLEY, HARRY HELMSLEY and
HELMSLEY
ENTERPRISES, INC.

Defendants

Index No.
COMPLAINT


Irving Schneider and Alvin Schwartz, as and for their
complaint against the defendants, by and through their
attorneys Squadron, Ellenoff, Plesent & Sheinfeld, LLP,
and Baer, Marks & Upham, respectfully allege as follows:

PARTIES

1. Plaintiff, Irving Schneider ("Schneider"), is a resident
of the City and County of New York.

2. Plaintiff Alvin Schwartz ("Schwartz"), is a resident of
Nassau County, New York.

3. Upon information and belief, Harry Helmsley
("Helmsley") is an individual residing in New York City
and Greenwich, Connecticut. Helmsley also owns, through
the medium of Helmsley Enterprises, Inc., over ninety-
nine (99%) of the outstanding shares of Helmsley-Spear,
Inc. ("H/S")

4. Upon information and belief, since in and after 1990,
Helmsley's health and his mental and phystcal cond1tion
has been such that he does not personally manage or make
judgments or decisions about his holdings and bus1ness.

5. Leona Helmsley ("Mrs. Helmsley"), is an individual
residing in New York City and Greenwich, Connecticut
and is the wife of Helmsley and improperly purports to
act in Helmsley's place w1th respect to Helmsley's
corporate and partnership obligations.

6. Upon information and belief, defendant, Helmsley
Enterprises, Inc. ("H/E") is a Delaware corporation with
its principal place of business at 230 Park Avenue, New
York, New York.

7. At various times between 1990 and the date hereof,
Mrs. Helmsley has been an officer and director of H/S and
H/E, but at all times material here Mrs. Helmsley has used
both H/S and H/E to effectuate the illicit scheme
hereinafter set forth.

JURISDICTION

8. This Court has Jurisdiction over defendants under
CPLR Section 302(a)(1) in that causes of action alleged
herein arise out of bus1ness transacted by these defendants
w1thtn the State of New York.

9. Each of Messrs. Schwartz and Schneider have been
affiliated with H/S for approximately fifly years. During
their tenure and in conjunction with Helmsley, they built
H/S tnto a pre-eminent brokerage and real-estate
management firm which earns fees in the millions of
dollars per year.

ALLEGATIONS COMMON TO ALL CAUSES OF
ACTION

10. Helmsley, as President of H/S and the principal of H/E
(the owner of 2284 of the 2286 shares of H/S) recognized
the unique and substantial contribution of plaintiffs. He
agreed with Schwartz and Schneider for each to become
shareholders of H/S and, in July, 1977, caused H/S and
H/E to enter into a lifetime Employment Agreement with
each of the plaintiffs (the "Employment Agreement.").

11. The Employment Agreement provides that plaintiffs
are to be compensated among other bases, in part on the
basis of H/S gross income, in part on the basis of
commissions received from managing particular
properties obtained through their efforts (including, but
not limited to those specified on exhibits to the
Employment Agreement).

12. On or about June 13, 1989, Respondent H/S agreed
with plaintiffs to increase the compensation of each of the
plaintiffs under the1r lifetime Employment Agreement
by $1,000,000 per year, "retroact1ve to the year ending
December 31, 1988." This amendment to their lifetime
Employment Agreement was memorialized ln a
Memorandum dated June 13, 1989 ("The Memorandum"),
which was signed by Helmsley in his capacity as the
President of H/S. The Memorandum was initialed by Mrs.
Helmsley.

13. Despite due demand, commencing October, 1990,
Mrs. Helmsley improperly caused H/S to fail and refuse to
make the payments required under the Memorandum. As
a consequence, H/S is currently indebted to each of
Schneider and Schwartz in an amount in excess of
$5,700,000, whtch sum continues to accrue on a monthly
basis.

14. Pursuant to the Employment Agreement, each of the
plaint1ffs is entitled to receive override commissions with
respect to each of the properties for which he is the
managing agent. Such override commissions are due and
have always been paid annually 1n the month of March.
In March, 1996, there was due and owing to each plaintiff
approx1mately $234,000 by reason of such commissions,
which sums Mrs. Helmsley caused H/S to refuse to pay.

15. On or about December 31, 1970, H/E and H/S entered
into an agreement, amended August 6, 1974, with
plaint1ffs (the "Option Agreement") wherein, inter alia,
Schwartz and Schneider were greeted the option to
purchase,upon the death of Helmsley, all shares of H/S
owned by H/E. The Option Agreement also grants
plaintiffs the right of first refusal ln the event H/E wishes
to sell or dispose of 1ts shares. More particularly, for the
purposes of this proceeding, the Option Agreement also
provides, in the event plaintiffs choose not to exercise
their option to buy upon the occurrence of e1ther of the'
aforesaid triggering events. that plaintiffs be paid, for a
period of four years, the compensation which they earned
during the last full year of their employment with H/S
(the "Payout Option").

16. Under the Employment and Option Agreements,
plaintiffs are entitled to substant1al payments at the
conclusion of their employment by H/S which payments
are based, in part, on the plaintiffs' level of compensation.
Consequently (because plaintiffs' compensation is
dependent upon the performance! of H/S), the financial
success of H/S is cr1tical to plaintiffs' receipt of the|
ultimate consideration prom1sed to them for their
lifetime employment.

17. Mrs. Helmsley has acknowledged that Helmsley has,
for a number of years, been incapable of understanding
or deal1ng w1th his financial affairs and has been absent
for increasing periods of time from all phases of the
businesses in wh1ch he once engaged, contributing
noth1ng to the conduct of such businesses.

18. Notwithstanding her repeated denials of any
involvement in the business and affairs of H/E and H/S.
and without any lawful authority, Mrs. Helmsley, on her
own behalf and purportedly acting on behalf of Helmsley
and H/E, has engaged in an egregious campaign to loot
H/S and render H/S insolvent so as to disable it from
meeting its obligations to the plaintiffs.

19. Plaintiffs have been obliged to commence and have
commenced an arbitration proceeding seeking an award
directing the payment of the compensation due under the
Memorandum as well & to enforce their other rights
under the Employment and Option Agreements, which
arbitration is now pending.

THE SCHEME TO LOOT HELMSLEY-SPEAR

20. Commencing in or before 1992, Mrs. Helmsley,
separately and in concert with H/E, engaged in an
intentional, calculated and bad-faith effort to transfer
assets from H/S to herself, to H/E and to other entities
controlled by her, without falr consideration. As
hereinafter alleged, while stating to a federal court that
her contribution to H/S was "extraordinarily small," she
extracted over $10 million dollars in compensation from
H/S; Mrs. Helmsley falsified (or caused to be falsified)
corporate records, including a May, 1990 memorandum
that was wholly inconsistent with her representations
concern1ng her lack of involvement with H/S and which
stated that her contribution to H/S was equal to that of
plaintiffs and which directed that her compensation from
H/S be "on equal par with them. Mrs. Helmsley shifted
millions of dollars of costs and expenses to H/S, including
those of a corporate aircraft used almost exclusively for
personal travel; and she caused the creation of fictitious
loans and the imposition of over $3 million in artificial
interest payments.

21. More specifically, and upon information and belief,
the transfers include, but are not limited to, the following:

a. A massive transfer of assets from H/S to H/E of an
amount in excess of $20,000.000. This has been
accomplished by (i) systematically "sweeping," or
emptying the bank accounts of H/S (ii) transferring the
funds therein to H/E on a periodic basis; (iii) 'lending'
money back to H/S so that H/S could pay 1ts bills and
other obl1gatlons as they become due; and (iv) charging
interest to H/S for the loan. The interest for the 'loan',
payable to H/E, has amounted to approximately
$1,000,000 per year over the period 1992 through and
including l995;

b. Use of H/S personnel to work on behalf of interests
controlled by Mrs. Helmsley and H/E without
reimbursement to H/S;

c. The payment without consideration by H/S of the
salaries of certain employees of H/E;

d. The payment w1thout consideration by H/S of certain
expenses of H/E;

e. The payment by H/S of salary to Mrs. Helmsley and
Helmsley in an aggregate amount in excess of $l3,000,000
despite the fact that Mrs. Helmsley and Helmsley have
been almost completely uninvolved in the operation of
H/S;

f. The payment by H/S of the outstanding loan in an
amount in excess of $l,000,000 for an aircraft util1zed
exclusively by Mrs. Helmsley and Helmsley for their
personal, non-corporate purposes. Significantly, the
aircraft is not carried as an "asset" on thc books of H/S.
Additionally, H/S has an outstanding liab11ity on its
accounting records in an amount in excess of $664.000,
which amounts are related to the operation and/or
maintenance of the aircraft; and

g. The transfer of properties for inadequate
consideration, from H/S to H/E or other entities
controlled by the Helmsleys.

22. Among many other properties, at least seventeen
properties owned or controlled by the Helmsleys, or by
entities controlled by them, have been managed by H/S
since their acquisition. Such management has been
satisfactory in all respects.

23. It was always understood that certain properties
owned or controlled by the Helmsleys, or by entit1es
controlled by them, would be managed by H/S (including
but not limited to those denominated in the Employment
Agreement as Management Properties) and that such
management was the fountation of the financia1 success of
H/S and, ultimately, the payments due to plaintiffs.

24. The plaintiffs have made extraordinary contributions
to the wealth accumulated by the Helmsleys in reliance
upon the payments promised to them which, in turn, were
founded upon the understanding that certain properties
would be managed by H/S.

25. The contracts for management of the subject huildings
are valuable assets belonging to H/S 1n accordance w1th
the understanding.

26. In furtherance of Hrs. Helmsley's offort to render H/S
insolvent and unable to satisfy its obligations to the
plaintiffs, Mrs. Helmsley caused seventeen letters, dated
March 29, 1996, to be sent to H/S purporting to terminate
H/S as managing agent for the named properties.

27. Upon information and bel1ef, Mrs. Helmsley is
arranging for the management of the buildings to be
transferred to Helmsley-Noyes, Inc. ("Noyes"), another
entity controlled by the Helmsleys. However, and as an
admission of the satisfactory nature of H/S management to
date, the buildings will be serviced by the same H/S
personnel and the same H/S computer facilities will be
utilized with respect to the management of the buildings
in the exact manner as they have been to date. The result
will be that plalnt1ffs will no longer supervise
management of the propert1es and H/S will not earn the
management fees which H/S would otherwise have earned.

28. Upon information and belief, H/S will receive no
consideration for the aforesaid transfers of the valuable
contractual right to manage the subject buildings.

29. Upon information and belief, the transfers
hereinabove described were made with the intent of
rendering H/S insolvent.

30. Upon further information and belief, at the time of
the transfers, Mrs. Helmsley, and H/E through Mrs.
Helmsley, intended or believed that H/S would incur debts
beyond its ability to pay as they mature.

31. As a result of the fraudulent conveyances described
above, Mrs. Helmsley, H/E and H/S have rendered H/S
incapable of satisfying the obligations owed by H/S to the
plaintiffs.

32. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.

AS AN FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(DEBTOR AND CREDITOR LAW SECTION 273 -

33. Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate herein by reference
each allegation of Paragraph One (1) through and
including Paragraph Thirty-Two (32) hereof as if fully

each.

35. Upon information and belief, the transfers by H/S 
aforesaid were made for no or insufficient consideration
at a time when H/S was insolvent or was rendered
insolvent thereby.

aforesaid, were made with the 1ntent of delaying and
defrauding the creditors of N/S and, in particular, to

<P>Jeffrey Katzenberg, former chairman of  Walt Disney Studios, sued Disney for breach of his employment contract. Katzenberg controlled the studios for a ten-year period during which profits rose 2500%. He is seeking 2% of profits from films and television projects produced or acquired before his September 1994 departure. Here is the April 9, 1996 complaint.</P>

SUPERIOR COURT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR 
THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES  
 
JEFFREY KATZENBERG, 
 
Plaintiff, 
 
vs. 
 
THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY and 
DOES 1 through 20, 
 
Defendants. 
 
CASE NO. BC147864 
 
COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT 
 
 
Plaintiff alleges as follows: 
 
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 
 
(Breach of contract as to Post-Termination Payments -- Against All 
Defendants)  
 
1. Plaintiff is a motion picture and television executive and resident 
of Los Angeles County. Defendant The Walt Disney Company 
("Disney") is a Delaware corporation doing business in Los 
Angeles County and throughout the world as a motion picture and 
television production and distribution company, a theme park 
owner and operator and the proprietor of other businesses.  
 
2. The true names or capacities, whether individual, corporate, 
associate or otherwise, of the defendants named herein as Does 1 
through 20 are unknown to plaintiff, who therefore sues said 
defendants by such fictitious names, and plaintiff will amend this 
complaint to show their true names and capacities when the same 
have been ascertained.  
 
3. In or about October, 1984, Katzenberg entered into the employ 
of Disney as Chairman of The Walt Disney Studios, a division of 
Disney, pursuant to a six-year contract (the "1984 Contract"). By 
the terms of the 1984 Contract, Katzenberg was given the 
responsibility to supervise and direct worldwide production, 
maketing and distribution of all Disney's live action and animated 
motion pictures and television programs ("Product"). A key 
element of Katzenberg's compensation under the 1984 Contract 
was an Incentive Bonus provision designed to compensate him to 
the extent he was able to achieve success in managing the Disney 
operations that were placed under his direction. The Incentive 
Bonus provision provided for payment to Katzenberg by Disney of 
2% of the gross receipts less cost as defined by the contract 
("Profits") derived by Disney from all Product as defined by the 
contract put into production or acquired for distribution during the 
term of his employment ("1984 Eligible Product"). As provided by 
the 1984 Contract, payment of the 2% Incentive Bonus with 
respect to Profits earned from the exploitation by Disney of 1984 
Eligible product subsequent to expiration of the term of 
employment would continue to be paid to Katzenberg pursuant to 
procedures provided for in the 1984 Contract.  
 
4. In 1988, prior to expiration of the term of the 1984 Contract, 
Disney solicited Katzenberg to enter into a new long-term written 
employment contract and Disney and Katzenberg thereafter entered 
into such a written employment contract subscribed by Disney and 
Katzenberg as of October 1, 1988 (the "1988 Contract"). The term 
of the 1988 Contract was six years, expiring September 30, 1994, 
subject to renewal, on the assent of both parties, for an additional 
two years, expiring September 30, 1996. The 1988 Contract 
provided for Katzenberg to continue to be employed as Chairman 
of The Walt Disney Studios and to continue the broad 
responsibilities he had been performing under the 1984 Contract.  
 
5. Once again, a key element of Katzenberg's compensation under 
the 1988 Contract was an Incentive Bonus provision providing for 
payment to Katzenberg by Disney of 2% of Disney's Profits from 
Product put into production or acquired for distribution during 
Katzenberg's employment under either the 1988 Contract or the 
1984 Contract ("Eligible Product"). Once again, the 1988 contract 
provided for payment of such 2% Incentive Bonus subsequent to 
the end of the term of the contract with respect to Profits earned by 
Disney after the term of the contract derived from Product that had 
been put into production or acquired for distribution during 
Katzenberg's employment going back to October of 1984.  
 
6. In the entertainment industry, revenues from live action and 
animated feature films and television programming often lag by 
many years, even decades, after the efforts and expenditures that 
are incurred to produce such products. For example, because of the 
lengthy time period that can elapse between commencement of 
production of an animated film, such as those for which Disney is 
note, and distribution of the film, the first revenues from the film 
may not be received until years after production commences. 
Notable films can continue to generate large revenues for decades 
thereafter, either by way of theatrical re-release or in other media 
such as the sale of videotapes. By way of example, in 1994, 
Disney's video re-release of "Snow White," an animated feature 
first released over fifty years earlier, generated gross revenues of 
some $800 million and profits of over $500 million. Likewise, 
successful television shows can realize large syndication revenues 
years or even decade after production commenced.  
 
7. For this reason, continued payment of the 2% Incentive Bonus 
with respect to Profits realized by Disney after the end of the term 
of Katzenberg's employment from the exploitation of Product put 
into production or acquired as a result of his efforts during the term 
of his employment ("Post-Termination Payments") was of the 
essence of the agreements between Katzenberg and Disney.  
 
8. The 1988 contract provided for such 
Post-Termination Payments to be made in the following manner:  
 
(a) For each of the two fiscal years occurring subsequent to 
termination of Katzenberg's employment, Disney was required to 
pay the Incentive Bonus calculated as 2% of Profits from Eligible 
Product earned in that fiscal year. 1.2 % of such Profits was to be 
paid within three months after the end of the fiscal year and the 
remaining .8% was to be paid (with interest) in 16 quarterly 
installments thereafter commencing within six months after the end 
of the fiscal year. Disney's fiscal years run from October 1 to 
September 30. The 1988 Contract employment term expired on 
September 30, 1994 unless extended to September 30, 1996.  
 
(b) With respect to all years thereafter--i.e., the decades during 
which Disney would continue to earn Profits from Eligible Product 
put into production or acquired during Katzenberg's employment--
an estimate of future profits from eligible Product was to be 
established on the second anniversary of the termination of the 
1988 Contract. Disney was then required promptly to pay to 
Katzenberg in a lump-sum the net present value of 2% of that 
estimated future amount.  
 
9. Katzenberg's tenure as head of The Walt Disney Studios--
Disney's Filmed Entertainment Division--was one of unparalleled 
success. For fiscal 1984--the year prior to Katzenberg's assuming 
his responsibilities--Disney's Filmed Entertainment Division 
generated gross revenues of only $244.5 million and had an 
operating income of only $2.2 million. For fiscal 1994, the final 
year o9f Katzenberg's tenure as head of the division, gross 
revenues were some $4.8 billion, with operating income of over 
$850 million. Throughout his tenure, both gross revenues and 
operating income increased, without exception, each year. 
Moreover, the profit levels achieved by Katzenberg as head of the 
Filmed Entertainment Division became the driving force for 
Disney's overall growth in profitability. While, historically, 
revenue and profits of the Theme Park division had dwarfed those 
of the Filmed Entertainment division, by the end of Katzenberg's 
tenure both gross revenues and operating income of the Filmed 
Entertainment division far outstripped those of the Theme Parks. 
The following chart, the numbers of which are derived from 
Disney's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
shows the comparative results of Filmed Entertainment and Theme 
Parks for the ten fiscal years--1985-1994--that Katzenberg headed 
Filmed Entertainment.

1993.................3,673.4............622.2  
 
1994.................4.793.3............856.1  
 
10. Pursuant to the terms of the 1988 Contract, Katzenberg was 
entitled to give one year's advance notice, in September 1993, that 
the 1988 Contract would expire as scheduled on September 30, 
1994 and would not be renewed until September 30, 1996. In 
September 1993, Katzenberg gave Disney such notice. On 
September 30, 1994, the term of the 1988 Contract expired and 
Katzenberg's employment by Disney ended.  
 
11. Katzenberg has done all things that have been required to be 
done by him under the 1988 Contract and he is in no manner or 
respect in breach thereof. At the time of Disney's acts of breach 
and repudiation hereinafter set forth, the 1988 Contract, but for 
Disney's breach, continued to impose obligations of performance 
upon Katzenberg.  
 
12. Disney has committed the following acts of breach and 
repudiation of the 1988 Contract: Disney has repeatedly claimed 
that it has no obligation to make _any_ Post-Termination Payments 
to Katzenberg, thereby repudiating its said obligation. Thereafter, 
despite repeated demand by and on behalf of Katzenberg, Disney 
for over a year has refused to acknowledge its contractual 
obligation to make such Post-Termination Payments. Additionally, 
the first of Disney's fiscal years occurring subsequent to 
termination of Katzenberg's employment ended on September 30, 
1995; Disney has failed and refused within three months of that 
date to make any Post-Termination Payment to Katzenberg for 
such fiscal year or to furnish any calculation to Katzenberg of the 
amount of any Post-Termination Payment for such fiscal year.  
 
13. As a direct and proximate result of Disney's breach and 
repudiation of the 1988 Contract, Katzenberg has suffered and will 
suffer substantial monetary damage in a sum not presently 
susceptible to precise calculation. The Profits expected to be 
received by Disney with respect to those Products put into 
production or acquired for distribution during the term of 
Katzenberg's employment have a net present value believed to be 
well in excess of $12.5 billion. Katzenberg is informed and 
believes and, on that ground, alleges that he has suffered monetary 
damages in a sum which will exceed $250 million. As a result of 
Disney's bad faith conduct, Katzenberg has incurred and will incur 
substantial attorneys' fees.  
 
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 
(Breach of Contract as to Pre-Termination Payments -- Against All 
Defendants)  
 
14. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 13 
hereinabove as though fully set forth herein.  
 
15. Both the 1984 Contract and the 1988 Contract required Disney 
to provide Katzenberg with supporting documentation and 
information enabling him to verify the accuracy of Disney's 
calculations or estimations of sums payable to him with respect to 
his Incentive Bonus.  
 
16. Despite a reasonable request by Katzenberg for the supporting 
documentation and information enabling him to verify the 
accuracy of Disney's calculations or estimations in respect of his 
Incentive Bonus payable to him prior to termination, Disney has 
refused to provide any such documentation and information.  
 
WHEREFORE, plaintiff prays judgment as follows:  
 
1. For damages in the sum of $250 million or such greater sum as 
shall be found to have been caused by Disney's breach and 
repudiation;  
 
2. For prejudgment interest at the highest lawful rate;  
 
3. For plaintiff's attorneys' fees in this action pursuant to Code of 
Civil Procedure Section 128.5;  
 
4. For an order requiring defendants to produce supporting 
documentation and information necessary to verify the accuracy of 
any calculations or estimations of plaintiff's Incentive Bonus; and  
 
5. For costs of suit and such other relief as the court shall deem 
proper.

<P>Lawyer F. Lee Bailey turned himself in to U.S. marshals in Tallahassee March 6 to begin serving a six-month jail term after a judge held him in contempt of court. Bailey failed to obey an order to turn over $2.3 million obtained from convicted drug smuggler Claude Duboc.</P>

<P>Bailey contends that money from the drug dealer was for legal fees and expenses, and that he has made a good faith effort to come up with the funds. Prosecutors say that the money belongs to the government as part of the forfeiture Duboc agreed to in a plea bargain.</P>
 
<P>Bailey says Duboc paid him in stock -- which was worth about $6 million when he received it -- and is now valued at $27 million. His lawyer, Roger Zuckerman, said that Bailey has deposited $700,000 with the court and is trying to obtain a letter of credit to cover the balance.</P>

<P>Here is Bailey's March 4 reply to the court after his emergency motion to avoid jail was denied.</P>

F. Lee Bailey 
 
Dated: March 4, 1996 
 
The government urges that incarceration of Mr. Bailey is necessary 
(a) to force him to pay $3 million, which will permit the return of 
stock, and (b) to force him to produce financial documents. The 
government has omitted to say the undisputed record evidence is 
that Mr. Bailey does not have $3 million but can, and desires to, 
pledge or transfer all of his assets to the court. And the government 
has not mentioned the thousands of financial documents Mr. 
Bailey produced, instead identifying a French "mortgage" 
document without acknowledging that not a single penny has 
changed hands pursuant to it. The document does not fit within the 
district court's demand for documents.  
 
As for the lawfulness of the February 3, 1996 order of civil 
contempt, the government makes important concessions: that there 
never was a show cause order, that the order of civil contempt 
illegally imposed a six-month prison sentence, and that the 
contempt adjudicated was the failure to produce documents and an 
accounting (not a failure to produce money or stocks). The 
government also omits other key facts: that the district court is a 
witness to the purely oral, off-the- record contract sought to be 
enforced and that the government has asserted the court made and 
has the only writing reflecting that oral contract.  
 
We show here compliance by Mr. Bailey with the civil contempt 
order's purge requirements and submission to the will of the court 
as expressed in the order. And we show that it was an abuse of 
discretion to order Mr. Bailey's incarceration. The court failed to 
find that financial documents had been withheld and failed to 
identify any such document; the record is uncontroverted that 
document production has been overwhelming in scope, such that 
any implied finding to the contrary is clearly erroneous. As for the 
payment of millions of dollars, the court failed to find that Mr. 
Bailey had the ability to pay before February 29, 1996, and the 
record is uncontroverted that he did not have the ability. Most 
critically, the district court and the government ignored Mr. 
Bailey's act of ultimate financial submission -- a transfer or pledge 
of all of his assets to the court.  
 
A. Mr. Bailey Has Demonstrated Compliance, and Incarceration 
Would Be Pointless and Punitive.  
 
At the hearing on February 26 and 27, 1996, Mr. Bailey agreed 
immediately to pledge or transfer a11 of his assets to the court (Tr. 
C 178, 179, 181, 206).<<Note 1 - Tr. A is the February 2-3 
hearing. Tr. B is the February 14 hearing. Tr. C is the February 27-
28 hearing.>> Mr. Bailey took this act of complete submission 
because he then had only about $40,000 in cash, a limited 
borrowing capacity, and illiquid assets less than the $5 .3 million 
the court's February 3, 1996 order required Mr. Bailey to pay (Tr. 
C 160, 167) . Remarkably, the district court's order of February 29, 
1996 does not mention that Mr. Bailey sought to pledge or transfer 
all of his assets to the court. And the matter is not mentioned 
anywhere in the government's opposition to a stay.  
 
A person can do no more to meet a financial obligation than to 
offer all that he has. In the related context of a supersedeas bond, 
which is highly relevant here because the ultimate merits of the 
dispute between Mr. Bailey and the United States have not been 
litigated and the court essentially has ordered a pre-judgment 
attachment to secure the claim of the United States, the Seventh 
Circuit held that a pledge of assets is sufficient when a defendant is 
financially unable to obtain a bond against a multimillion dollar 
judgment. Olympia Equipment Leasing Co. v. Western Union 
Telegraph Co., 786 F.2d 794 (7th Cir. 1986) (Posner, J.); accord, 
Waffenschmidt v. Mackay, 763 F.2d 711, 727 (5th Cir. 1985); see 
generally United States v. Antar, 53 F.3d 568, 578 (3d Cir. 1995).        
 
Again, the court ignored the offer to pledge or transfer all assets. 
Instead, at page 8 of the February 29, 1996 order, the district court 
made the unexplained finding that Mr. Bailey "has the ability to 
pay at least $3.0 million," but there is no consideration of the 
uncontradicted evidence that a loan of this magnitude on illiquid 
assets takes more time to arrange than the less than 20 business 
days available to Mr. Bailey (Tr. C 150-65). Indeed, there is no 
examination at all of Mr. Bailey's finances.  
 
The government also fails to explain how Mr. Bailey could have 
paid millions of dollars to the court by February 29, 1996 -- or why 
a pledge or transfer of all assets is insufficient. We do not mean to 
say that the government's explanation is wrong; we mean to say 
that there is nQ explanation. The government chose to present as 
evidence below concerning compliance issues. This is a fatal 
failure because, if the government wishes to argue that Mr. Bailey 
was capable of further compliance, it bears the burden of proof by 
clear and convincing evidence under CFTC v. Wellington Precious 
Metals. Inc., 950 F.2d 1525 (11th Cir. 1992). The government 
simply misreads Wellington's "burden of production" as the 
equivalent of a burden of proof, never acknowledging that a 
"burden of production" is a burden shifting concept and that the 
government bears the ultimate and heavy burden under Wellington.  
 
Mr. Bailey met his burden of production. He presented an 
accounting by Arthur Andersen (Exh. 30, 2/27/96) and the 
testimony of one of its partners tracing funds and proving the 
absence of hidden funds or assets (Tr. C 89-95). (Neither the 
district court nor the government appear to challenge this 
accounting.) He presented his financial statement (Exh. 13, 
2/27/96)(Tr. C 154-60, 167) showing about $42,000 in cash and 
the remainder in illiquid assets, mostly airplanes and boats. Mr. 
Bailey testified in detail about his inability to obtain bank 
financing on the strength of such assets (Tr. C 160-62, 179-80, 
205-06, 262), as did a financing specialist engaged by Mr. Bailey 
to "liquefy" Mr. Bailey's assets by obtaining other financing (Tr. C 
150-65, 176-77). Mr. Bailey and the financing specialist made it 
clear that financing would be very difficult, but doable, something 
that will take more than the days Mr. Bailey had available before 
February 29, 1996 (Tr. C 16466, 267-69). And Mr. Bailey made it 
crystal clear that he wished to pledge or transfer all his assets to the 
court (Tr. C 178, 179, 181, 206, 266, 279).<<Note 2 - Financing on 
the strength of any asset is uncertain because of the government's 
contention that the equity in the assets reflected Mr. Bailey's 
receipt, with notice, of forfeitable property. A prudent lender 
would require assurance from the government, endorsed by the 
court, that the lender will have a valid security interest.>> All of 
this evidence was unrebutted.  
 
Finally, evidence concerning massive document compliance was 
unrebutted. The Arthur Andersen accounting and its schedules 
constitute a complete outline of Mr. Bailey's personal and 
professional financial life. In addition, Mr. Bailey produced 
thousands of financial records, which are exhibits (Doc. 95 & 111). 
One need only to flip through the documents to realize that Mr. 
Bailey's bank statements, cancelled checks, check registers, home 
purchase documents, law firm documents, Credit Suisse 
documents, credit card documents, and numerous other documents 
are there. The district court's description of this as a "start" is 
without any basis in the record. The record demonstrates beyond 
doubt that document collection and production began February 5, 
1996 and that thousands of documents were produced to the court 
on February 14, and thereafter to the government during the week 
of February 19, and the remainder at the February 27 and 28 
hearing Mr. Bailey requested (Tr. B 2-32; Tr. C 15-26, 61, 144-45; 
Transcript of "Sealed Proceedings Held in Jury Room", February 
27, 1996) . Critically, the district court made no finding that there 
is any additional record to produce. The government purports to 
identify one record, a "mortgage" on a property in France which 
the government approved, but the record is uncontroverted that Mr. 
Bailey does not have such a record (it is in France) and that no 
penny has changed hands pursuant to this "mortgage" (Tr. C 253-
56, 274-76. ) The "mortgage" is in the nature of a mechanic's lien, 
there being no promissory note or mortgage to fund. Most 
important, the so-called "mortgage" is not within the court's 
description of documents demanded to be produced because there 
were no "proceeds" from it.  
 
B. The District Court and the Government Impermissibly Rely 
upon Pre-February 3. 1996 Conduct to Justify Incarceration.  
 
The government urges that incarceration is required because of pre-
February 3 conduct, with the not-so-subtle premise that 
punishment is appropriate. The government spent most of its time 
below pursuing the allegation that, in January 1996, Mr. Bailey 
transferred assets in violation of a freeze order Mr. Bailey testified 
he had not seen. In its response filed in this Court, at pages 13 
through 19, the government restricts its argument concerning 
financial impossibility to events allegedly occurring before the 
February 3, 1996 contempt order. Almost unbelievably, the 
government never asserts that it was possible, or not impossible, 
for Mr. Bailey to pay millions of dollars.  
 
The district court took pains to explain that incarceration is 
required because of pre-February 3, 1996 events. Nearly 100% of 
the court's order is devoted to these irrelevant events. The evidence 
concerning them is recounted at length (pages 1 to 6 of the order), 
and then findings concerning them are made at length (pages 6 
through 8 of the order).  
 
Finally, the district court finding that Mr. Bailey knew in January 
of a freeze order, in addition to being irrelevant to compliance 
issues, rests on a single piece of evidence, the recollection of an 
AUSA that Mr. Bailey said several weeks ago he had read the 
freeze order (Tr. C 294- 95). The government does not claim that 
Mr. Bailey was in court when the freeze order was entered; he was 
in New York. The AUSA who later spoke with Mr. Bailey 
prepared several typed pages of minutes of the meeting with 
descriptions of Mr. Bailey's statements (Exh. 44, 2/28/96)(Tr. C 
303-10). Those minutes contain no reference to the statement that 
the AUSA recollects now. The January 12, 1996 order does not 
mention Mr. Bailey's bank accounts and does not apply to loans 
made by Credit Suisse; those loans were not, in the words of the 
order, "monies . . . received . . . from or on behalf of Duboc."  
 
Similarly, the courts later order of January 25 did not purport to 
"freeze" anything but merely required the return of BioChem stock 
and replacement "stock." See Atiyeh v. Capps, 449 U.S. 1312, 
1317 (1981) (Rehnquist, Circuit Justice).  
 
C. The February 3. 1996 Order of Civil Contempt Was Illegal.  
 
By order of January 25, 1996, the court ordered Mr. Bailey to 
appear in court to produce stock, financial information and an 
accounting. When Mr. Bailey appeared, it is undisputed that, 
without a prior order to show cause, he was called as the first 
witness and, in the same proceeding, adjudicated in civil contempt. 
Counsel for Mr. Bailey informed the court that he needed 
additional time to prepare and to present his case (Tr. A 169-71). 
Mercer v. Mitchell, 908 F.2d 763 (llth Cir. 1990), is clear that due 
process requires a prior order to show cause.  
 
It also is undisputed that the February 3, 1996 contempt order was 
rendered illegal by the imposition of a fixed six-month prison 
sentence. The government sought a modification of this defect on 
the last day of the possible compliance period. The district court 
thereupon issued its February 29, 1996 reimposing a fixed six-
month sentence, but saying it could be purged at any time. This 
ignores, however, that the February 3, 1996 order of civil contempt 
was itself illegal and, thus, unenforceable.  
 
Further, the government does not dispute that the court below is a 
key witness to, indeed a party to, the contract it seeks to enforce, a 
contract not embodied in any document other than in notes the 
government claims were made by the court. No aspect of this oral 
contract was made on the record, and the government contends it 
has no piece of paper reflecting the contract. The decision requires 
on-the-record revelation and cross-examination of the key evidence 
the government says the court has. The issue is not one of bias; the 
court is a material witness.  
 
The government also concedes that Mr. Bailey was held in 
contempt on February 3, 1996 only for failure to produce financial 
information and an accounting. According to the contempt order, 
however, Mr. Bailey could not purge even if he produced all of the 
requested financial records and an accounting. To purge, he was 
required also to pay millions of dollars and to produce stock. The 
government cites no authority that a purge obligation can extend 
beyond the scope of the underlying contempt. See United States v. 
Smallwood, 870 F.2d 658 (6th Cir. 1989).  
 
Finally, the government contends Mr. Bailey was not entitled to a 
jury trial under 21 U.S.C.   882(b) because the forfeitures at issue 
are criminal. The government does not tell the Court that the 
forfeitures below were civil forfeitures when they actually were 
made, that no order of criminal forfeiture was entered, and that the 
plea agreement did not mention the stock.  
 
D. The Government Incorrectly Describes the Merits Issues and the 
Public Interest.  
 
In its opposition to a stay, at pages 4, 5, 14 and 15, the government 
retreats to its "merits" position that Mr. Bailey wrongly sold or 
borrowed against the BioChem shares and thereby seeks to 
bootstrap Mr. Bailey into a contempt. Discovery has not even 
begun on these "merits" issues. We are constrained, however, to 
point out here that the government omits or misstates the 
following: (1) Mr. Duboc, assisted by an AUSA and a DEA agent, 
made a fee simple transfer of the shares to Bailey by wire on April 
26, 1994 (Tr. A 255-56); (2) the transfer was not accompanied by 
any document establishing a trust or otherwise restricting the 
transfer (Tr. A 331-33); (3) Mr. Bailey bore the full risk of loss of 
the value of the stock, 1088 of his fees and 1088 of the expenses he 
advanced (Tr. A 324-26, 339-40, 347); (4) DOJ guidelines 
preclude transfer of a forfeitable asset to an attorney for use as fees 
(as do Caplin & Drysdale and Monsanto); (5) Mr. Bailey was able 
to make interim expenditures without prior court approval and 
believed himself similarly free to take interim distributions for his 
time investment, all subject to eventual court approval (Tr. A 262, 
268, 335, 378); (6) the government was silent at the May 17, 1994 
recorded plea proceeding about any trust arrangement with respect 
to Mr. Bailey and the stock (Tr. A 264); (7) the written plea 
agreement (Doc. 16) does not mention the stock and referred only 
to a list of assets which had not been created yet (Tr. A 351- 52); 
(8) Mr. Shohat, Mr. Duboc's other attorney, drafted an unexecuted 
fee agreement after the stock transfer specifying that his fees were 
to come from nonforfeitable assets (Tr. A 187); (9) after transfer of 
the shares, the government took no interest in them and never acted 
as if it owned them (Tr. A 36467, 383- 93); and (10) the 
government will agree that it filed numerous civil forfeiture actions 
against Duboc property but never did 80 with respect to the shares 
of stock (Tr. 364- 66).  
 
As for the public's interest in the government's management of the 
BioChem stock, we note that Mr. Bailey, for weeks, has sought 
vainly the government's agreement to the immediate sale of enough 
shares to remove the $2.3 million lien, which amount can be 
secured by Mr. Bailey's property, all in order that a11 the 
remaining shares be transferred to the United States forthwith. The 
government has resisted this approach demonstrating more interest 
in maintaining the perception of Mr. Bailey's noncompliance than 
in achieving the transfer of stock.

<P>Lawyer F. Lee Bailey turned himself in to U.S. marshals in Tallahassee March 6 to begin serving a six-month jail term after a judge held him in contempt of court. Bailey failed to obey an order to turn over $2.3 million obtained from convicted drug smuggler Claude Duboc.</P>

<P>Bailey contends that money from the drug dealer was for legal fees and expenses, and that he has made a good faith effort to come up with the funds. Prosecutors say that the money belongs to the government as part of the forfeiture Duboc agreed to in a plea bargain.</P>

<P>Bailey says Duboc paid him in stock -- which was worth about $6 million when he received it -- and is now valued at $27 million. His lawyer, Roger Zuckerman, said that Bailey has deposited $700,000 with the court and is trying to obtain a letter of credit to cover the balance. </P>

MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION 
 
I. Introduction 
 
The District Court has ordered F. Lee Bailey to be incarcerated 
tomorrow, Friday, March 1, 1996, because he has not paid 
approximately $3.0 million. The District Court imposed the 
incarceration in the exercise of its civil contempt power, but the 
order is illegal. It was entered without the essential elements of due 
process; indeed, there never has been a show-cause order. 
Moreover, the order is impermissibly punitive, not coercive. The 
unrebutted evidence is (a) that Mr. Bailey has approximately 
$50,000 cash, (b) that the remainder of his assets consist of illiquid 
real estate, boats and airplanes, and (c) that Mr. Bailey has offered 
to pledge or hand over all of his assets to the court immediately.  
 
The government argued that it is not sufficient for Mr. Bailey to 
give the court all he has (and there is no dispute that he has offered 
and will do this immediately). Instead, without evidence of any 
kind -- not a single witness or document -- the government argued, 
and the district court accepted, that millions of dollars might be 
forthcoming in some unspecified way if Mr. Bailey's "feet are held 
to the fire" by incarceration. In the face of a pledge or transfer to 
the Court of Mr. Bailey's entire financial statement, which consists 
of about $50,000 cash and illiquid assets, incarceration as a tool to 
coerce payment of $3.0 million is illogical, crude and unfair. It 
constitutes, in truth, a decision to remand Mr. Bailey to debtors' 
prison to punish him for perceived misconduct, not to coerce 
payment of money.  
 
We show here that all of this has occurred almost immediately 
after the government claimed a right to stock it transferred to Mr. 
Bailey, and well before any trial of the merits issues. In essence, 
there is a pre-judgment attachment to secure the government's 
claim. Mr. Bailey can do no more than pledge or transfer to the 
Court all that he has. In fairness, it is overwhelmingly sufficient. In 
the law of civil contempt, anything else would illegally punitive.  
 
We stand ready to pursue the appeal of the civil contempt order on 
any expedited basis the Court should order. We will appear 
immediately if the Court wishes argument on this motion. Pending 
appeal, and certainly pending decision on this motion, we urge that 
the district court's order of incarceration be stayed.  
 
II. Summary of Facts and Proceedings Below Mr. Bailey's 
Representation of Claude Duboc  
 
Mr. Claude Duboc, Mr. Bailey's client, was indicted for various 
drug trafficking offenses by the United States. Following his 
extradition to the United States in early 1994, Duboc contacted Los 
Angeles attorney Robert Shapiro to represent him. (Tr. 197 - 98, 
215.)<<Note 1 - References to the transcript (Tr.) refers to the 
transcript of proceedings held in the District Court on February 2 
and 3, attached hereto as Exhibit 2.>> Shapiro contacted Bailey 
and the two undertook to represent Duboc, with Bailey acting as 
lead counsel. Bailey had numerous meetings with the prosecutors 
and case agents in April 1994. (Tr. 208, 242-43.) Bailey 
determined that a guilty plea and cooperation with the government 
would be in Duboc's best interests given the nature of the case and 
the possibility of life imprisonment. (Tr. 222, 224, 237. ) The plea 
would involve the turnover of a vast array of assets held by Duboc 
outside of the United States. (Tr. 224-25, 240. ) Some were 
probably forfeitable. Others would have been difficult to repatriate, 
either because they were located in foreign jurisdictions unwilling 
to allow the transfer of the asset to the United States, (Tr. 244), or 
because it could not reasonably be shown that the foreign asset was 
purchased with the proceeds of illegal drug transactions in the 
United States. (Tr. 238-29. ) During debriefings in April, Bailey 
and Duboc provided a list of all of Duboc's assets. (Tr. 148, 165-
66.)  
 
Among Duboc's overseas assets were two yachts and two very 
expensive homes (total value as much as $50 million) and other 
illiquid assets held by Duboc in France. (Tr. 265, 316.) As part of 
the plea discussions in April of 1994, it was agreed that these 
assets would be forfeited. (Tr. 318- 19.) Forfeiture of such assets, 
however, was complicated because of their location in France and 
their illiquid nature. (Tr. 244.) It was agreed among the 
government, Bailey and Duboc that Bailey would undertake to 
maintain, market and sell the properties so that the proceeds could 
be repatriated to the United States. (Tr. 265.) Apparently, the 
government was concerned that it would not be able to obtain the 
proceeds from the property without using Mr. Bailey, there being 
no treaty between France and the United States allowing for the 
transfer of French property allegedly purchased with the proceeds 
of illegal drug transactions.  
 
Major expense would be involved in the upkeep of the assets, 
particularly the homes. Taxes, staff costs, some repairs, and related 
expenses were required to be borne by Bailey for whatever period 
the homes were to be kept until they could successfully be 
marketed. (Tr. 209-11.) Marketing and transaction costs and other 
related expenses would also be involved.  
 
In discussions on April 26, 1994, the government sought a vehicle 
by which Bailey (and perhaps other counsel) would be reimbursed 
for the expected substantial costs of upkeep for these massive and 
valuable properties. (Tr. 315, 321, 370-71, 374.)  
 
In addition, the government and Bailey sought a vehicle that would 
cover Bailey's legal fees and those of co-counsel. (Tr. 22728, 320, 
370-71). All of the parties contemplated that the order of 
magnitude of the legal fees substantially exceeded a million dollars 
(Tr. 227-28, 241, 269, 277, 340), although the government 
declined to "authorize" any particular fee (Tr. 370). It was also 
understood that expenses, as well, would be substantial. (Tr. 
26566, 315, 321, 370-71, 374.)  
 
The Agreement of April 26, 1994 
 
Bailey, Assistant United States Attorney Gregory Miller and a case 
agent had discussions on April 26, 1994, about dedicating an asset 
that might be made available to serve both as the source of legal 
fees and the funding for the expenses incurred in connection with 
the properties. (Tr. 319-20, 370-71.) There were discussions about 
a substantial cash account held by Duboc. (Tr. 373, 398.) 
Thereafter, the government suggested 602,000 shares of Biochem 
Pharma, Inc. stock, held by Duboc in an account in his name at 
UBS, a Luxembourg brokerage. (Tr. 278, 294, 300.) The shares 
may well have been purchased in Canada with Canadian funds and 
there apparently was doubt at the time about their actual 
forfeitability.  
 
The Biochem shares were selling in the range of $9 to $10. (Tr. 
292.) Duboc, however, believed that there was a significant chance 
that the shares might appreciate. (Tr. 248, 292, 314-15.)  
 
Bailey agreed to take the shares as the source of the payment of his 
and other counsel's legal fees and expenses. (Tr. 248, 300, 338.) He 
was warned by Miller of the risk involved due to the possibility the 
price of the stock would in fact decline. (Tr. 248-49, 324-25.) 
Miller testified that in his mind, if the shares had gone down 
(which he viewed as unlikely), there would be no other source to 
which Bailey could look for his legal fees and expense 
reimbursements, and the government would not permit other assets 
to be used that for purpose. (Tr. 324-26, 338-41, 373.) Thus, if the 
value of the stock declined, Bailey might have gotten no fee and 
been reimbursed no expenses. (Tr. 339-340.)  
 
Within a few hours of having settled on the Biochem shares as the 
funding source for all of the legal fees and all of the expenses 
incurred in connection with the properties, Miller and case agent 
Carl Lilley prepared stock transfer documents for Duboc to execute 
authorizing the transfer of the shares from the UBS account in 
Luxembourg to an account that Bailey had at Credit Suisse in 
Switzerland. (Tr. 255-56.) The document was executed by Duboc 
transferring to Bailey 602,000 Biochem Pharma shares in fee 
simple and without limitation on April 26, 1994. (Tr. 255-56.) The 
shares arrived in Bailey's account on or about May 9, 1994. (Tr. 
250.)  
 
The Absence of Writings 
 
Excluding the stock transfer document, no representative of the 
government prepared any writing concerning the agreement with 
Bailey pursuant to which the shares were given him. (Tr. 260, 
35859.) There is no written agreement with Bailey regarding the 
shares, no internal memorandum prepared by any Assistant United 
States Attorney, no statement on the record of any court 
proceeding, no documentation with the Department of Justice or 
the Asset Forfeiture Division pursuant to any Attorney Fee 
Forfeiture Guideline. (Tr. 264, 296, 336-37, 376.) (There may be a 
memorandum prepared by United States Attorney Patterson two 
days after the plea in late May 1994 for an official at the 
Department of Justice. The government has declined to produce 
that memorandum or describe it, and it is unclear whether it 
articulates the April agreement with Bailey in any detail or 
significant specificity.) In addition, as it seems the transfer to 
Bailey occurred on the day the government first conceived it, (Tr. 
255.), it does not appear that any Department of Justice official 
was consulted regarding the transfer.  
 
The Differing Understandings 
 
It is now clear that the oral discussions concerning the Biochem 
stock yielded distinctly different impressions of what was agreed 
and intended. Bailey understood that the government had agreed to 
transfer to him in fee simple for counsels' legal fees, and for 
expenses in connection with the properties, stock which the 
government determined to be nonforfeitable and hence available 
for use as legal fees. (Tr. 246, 284, 287, 306-07.) He understood 
that he was being given full right, title and interest in the stock (Tr. 
256, 258), and that the shares were his to invest, protect, or use as 
he saw fit, since he bore the risk that their loss in value would 
diminish his capacity to look to the shares for fees or expenses. 
(Tr. 268-69, 295, 296.) As a consequence, he had the right to act as 
he saw fit to protect himself. (Tr. 249.) He believed that he was 
entitled to the upside gain since he bore the risk. (Tr. 52, 250-52, 
270, 295, 297, 305.)  
 
He conceived the understanding with the government as one in 
which he had an obligation to ultimately return to the government a 
sum certain, computed as the value of the shares on the day he 
received them, less what the Court ultimately approved for his 
legal fees and expenses. (Tr. 249.) Assuming that the shares were 
worth $6 million on the date of receipt, May 9, 1994, he had an 
obligation eventually to return to the government in dollars that 
amount less legal fees and expenses that were approved. (Tr. 
25051, 268, 296, 298.) While he viewed himself as obliged 
ultimately to obtain that approval, he did not believe that he was 
required to obtain approval for every disbursement for expenses or 
fees in advance of their distribution to him, but rather in 
connection with a final accounting. (Tr. 253, 269, 276.) As a 
consequence, he made distributions without court approval to 
himself both for expenses incurred and time invested in the matter. 
(Tr. 76, 83, 267-69. )  
 
The shares did not diminish in value during 1994. In 1995 they 
began to appreciate substantially. Bailey took a fraction of this 
appreciation, in addition to his fees, on the understanding that he 
owned the shares outright and that title had been transferred to him 
for good or ill. (Tr. 271. )       
 
The government viewed the arrangement differently. Assistant 
United States Attorney Miller's conception was that the 
government had simply "parked" the shares with Bailey. The idea 
was that Bailey would hold the shares, allowing the government 
effectively to "speculate" that their value would increase. This 
would give the government the benefit of any increased value in 
the shares and avoid depressing their value by unloading 602,000 
shares at one time in to the market. (Tr. 314-15, 318, 342. ) The 
government would retain its ultimate ownership of the shares and 
its remainder interest in the shares as forfeitable property by this 
parking mechanism. (Tr. 319, 342. ) The government would delay 
the filing of a forfeiture claim until the French properties were 
sold, legal fees paid to counsel, and other expenses retired. (Tr. 
318-19, 34950. ) The remaining shares, having appreciated 
presumably, would then be forfeited. (Tr. 328-29. ) Throughout the 
period in which Bailey held the shares, he was not to hold them as 
his in fee but instead would simply hold them "in trust," though no 
trust instrument was ever prepared. (Tr. 318-319, 322, 355-56, 378. 
)  
 
The Colloquy in Chambers 
 
Duboc pled guilty on May 17, 1994, represented by Bailey and co-
counsel. The written plea agreement prepared by the government 
does not contain any reference to the arrangement with Bailey. The 
plea agreement does not reference the 602,000 Biochem shares 
directly or indirectly. There is no list of forfeitable assets appended 
to the plea agreement nor is there any textual basis upon which to 
conclude that the 602,000 Biochem shares were intended to be 
subject to forfeiture. Duboc appeared and entered his plea in open 
court. There is no reference in the record of that proceeding to the 
understanding that the government had negotiated with Bailey 
regarding legal fees.  
 
The only reference to the Biochem transaction occurred during a 
brief colloquy in chambers before Chief Judge Paul prior to the 
plea proceeding on the morning of May 17, 1994. (Tr. 375. ) The 
chambers conference was not transcribed. All parties agree that the 
judge was told that counsel's fees would be subject to court 
approval. (Tr. 262, 321, 334, 378. ) Bailey and the government 
differ as to when court approval was required. (Tr. 253, 269, 276, 
320-22. ) The nuances of the understanding as regards who held 
title to the shares, who bore the risk of their loss, who bore the 
benefit of their gain, or a half dozen other contingencies associated 
with the understanding were apparently not addressed.  
 
The Government's Conduct from May of 1994 through Early 
January 1996  
 
From the time of the plea until early January 1996, the government 
can point to nothing it said or did that is consistent with its present 
claim that it believed it had, beyond its claim for the original $6 
million dollars less fees and expenses, a remainder interest in the 
potentially increased value of the Biochem shares. No prosecutor 
or case agent ever followed the price of the shares, (Tr. 383-85.), 
even though the value of the shares could easily be obtained since 
the stock price is reported daily in the NASDAQ listings in the 
newspaper (Tr. 384, 3875-88, 390, 393.) No prosecutor or case 
agent was aware that the shares appreciated substantially in 1995. 
(Tr. 383, 385-88.) No inquiry was made of Bailey or any other 
counsel regarding the value of the shares. (Tr. 383-84.) No effort 
was made to capture the increasing value of the shares by 
liquidating portions of them as the price rose, although the value in 
1995 began vastly to exceed the original $6 million. (Tr. 384-85.) 
The government could offer no explanation, either, why if it 
believed itself the ultimate owner of the shares, it allowed them to 
be deposited in the first instance in a Swiss bank account, vastly 
complicating repatriation, instead of a U.S. bank or brokerage 
account. (Tr. 359-60, 363.)  
 
At no time through all of 1994 and 1995 did the government seek 
an order of forfeiture or file a civil forfeiture complaint as to the 
Biochem shares, (Tr. 364-66.), although it did so with respect to 
other of Duboc's assets. And, as noted, it never produced any 
writing, memorandum, court pleading, record representation, or 
any other reasonably reliable memorialization of its purported 
continuing ownership in the shares. (Tr. 364, 367, 392.) Simply 
put, up until January 11, 1996, the government acted as if it had 
given the shares to Bailey, caring no further about them and 
allowing the risk of loss or risk of gain to be Bailey's. (Tr. 389.)  
 
On or about January 11, 1996, Duboc sought to terminate Bailey's 
services and substitute new counsel. At the hearing on his motion 
to substitute counsel, Duboc's new attorneys advised that the value 
of the Biochem shares had risen from approximately $10 to 
something in the range of $40 a share. It is at this point that the 
government first learned of the increase in value. Only thereafter 
did the government begin to assert in the district court its 
entitlement to the remainder interest in the Biochem shares on 
grounds that the shares were "forfeitable" and that Bailey was 
simply a "trustee".  
 
The Order to Appear on February 2, 1996 
 
On January 22, 1996, the government filed an Emergency Motion 
to Surrender Property (Doc. 67) in which it claimed the shares 
were forfeitable. The motion sought a court order requiring Bailey 
to immediately place the remaining Biochem shares in the court's 
repository and deliver to the court an accounting of his handling of 
the stock.  
 
The court acted upon the government's Emergency Motion to 
Surrender Property by ordering (Doc. 68) on Thursday, January 25, 
1996, that Bailey appear in court the next week "to answer, in 
person, the Government's Motion," and to bring with him the 
Biochem stock or any assets into which it may have been 
converted, plus a full accounting, with documentation, of "all 
assets he received from Claude Duboc, directly or indirectly, and 
all disbursements made, including the purpose for such 
disbursement," as well as "all bank records * * * pertaining to all 
assets, or proceeds from the sale/mortgage/pledge/ hypothecation 
thereof, received by him, directly or indirectly, as attorney or agent 
for Claude Duboc." Under the Order, the date for Bailey to appear 
was Thursday, February 1, but on January 26, the court reset the 
hearing for Friday, February 2.  
 
On January 25, upon receipt of the court's order of that date, Bailey 
contacted counsel to represent him with respect to the order and his 
appearance the next week. Bailey met with counsel on Saturday, 
January 27. Counsel had four business days thereafter to prepare 
for Bailey's response on February 2.  
 
Before court was called to session on the morning of February 2, 
Bailey filed a motion to continue the hearing to permit sufficient 
time to prepare; a motion to permit him to take discovery; a motion 
to vacate the order requiring the turnover of stocks and assets on 
the grounds that the order was one to effect a seizure ancillary to a 
forfeiture and must be conducted in accordance with the statutorily 
required procedures; motions to recuse the judge and to disqualify 
government counsel, the First Assistant United States Attorney for 
the district, on the grounds that they both were material witnesses 
to undocumented discussions concerning the terms of the oral 
agreement between Bailey and the government; and a demand for a 
jury trial. All of the motions were summarily denied.  
 
The February 2-3 Hearing 
 
Prior to the commencement of the February 2-3 hearing, there was 
never any motion for contempt filed by the government and no 
show cause order issued by the court. Indeed, the court's order 
fixing the hearing date required not that Bailey appear to defend a 
contempt proceeding, but rather "to answer, in person," the 
government's "Emergency Motion to Surrender Property" and to 
produce shares of stock, plus pertinent records and accountings.  
 
The government's Emergency Motion was not a contempt motion 
and does not even mention the word. <<Note 2 - The government 
wrote a letter to Bailey, dated January 29, indicating an intention to 
"seek" contempt sanctions if Bailey were not to comply with the 
court's order, i.e., to "answer in person" the allegations of the 
emergency motion and to produce the stock and documentation. 
The letter does not suggest that Bailey must show cause why he 
should not be held in contempt. Moreover, the court, which was 
copied with the letter, dispelled any notion that such 
correspondence would be the functional equivalent of a motion. 
Rather, the court emphasized it had not and would not read letters 
from either side. "THE COURT:* * * Any time you want to talk to 
the Court, you file a motion. MR. ZUCKERMAN: Is that same 
rule apply to the government? THE COURT: Absolutely. I haven't 
read -I don't have any motion or any letter from the government 
that I've read in this case. I don't intend to, and I don't want either 
side favoring me with a copy of a letter between lawyers." (Tr. 
28.)>> Indeed, it is apparent from counsel's comments during the 
first stages of the proceedings on February 2, that he believed the 
hearing would cover, at most, the government's contentions in its 
Emergency Motion to Surrender Property and the status of efforts 
to comply with the production and documentation requirements of 
the January 25 order.<<Note 3 - Counsel argued that it would be 
unfair to force Bailey to present his case on the "merits" -- that is, 
the meaning and provisions of an undocumented oral agreement -- 
on only one week's notice and without discovery or access to 
witnesses. (Tr. 35-36.) A hearing on the merits was, therefore, 
postponed until a future time. As of the date of this motion. there 
has been no merits hearing.>> (Tr. 2, 6, 27, 38.)  
 
The government did raise the issue of contempt at the hearing, 
stating that if the hearing indicated Bailey was not in full 
compliance with the provisions of the court's orders "it is the 
government's intention to request that he be held in contempt of 
court, civil contempt." (Tr. 23, 39.) It cited as due notice the 
January 29 letter to Bailey -- a letter that the court refused to read 
precisely because it was not a proper motion. The court, however, 
did not endorse the government's suggestion to treat the 
proceedings as a contempt hearing and, instead, called Bailey to 
take the stand without once indicating that contempt was to be an 
issue at this hearing. In fact, prior to the commencement of 
testimony, the court had never, either before the hearing or during 
it, written or spoken the words "contempt" or "show cause".  
 
The taking of testimony proceeded to the end of the day. Bailey 
testified until the lunch break. (Tr. 43-100.) After lunch, the 
government pressed the notion that the hearing was really one on 
the issue of contempt and sanctions for contempt. (Tr. 110-114.) 
Again, the court did not endorse this view of the proceedings, but 
does appear to have begun gravitating toward that position, 
commenting, for example, "Well, I think what I'm interested in 
today is where are the assets, what happened to the assets, why the 
information has or has not been produced here in open court." (Tr. 
112.)  
 
The government then called Edward Shohat and Robert Shapiro, 
both of whom had been co-counsel with Bailey on the Duboc 
defense. Their testimony consumed the remainder of the day on 
Friday. After that, and as the court was adjourning for the evening 
at 5:44 p.m., the court for the first -- and only -- time uttered the 
words "show cause," finally making it clear that the hearing had 
become a hearing on contempt: "We are going to recess until the 
morning, and we're going to determine only the question to show 
cause." (Tr. 231.) Thus, at close of business on a Friday night in 
Ocala, Florida, without access to records, witnesses or legal 
research, Bailey and his counsel were told that the hearing had 
been transformed into a hearing to show cause why Bailey should 
not be held in contempt.  
 
The hearing resumed at 9 o'clock on Saturday morning and 
continued until shortly past 2:00 p.m. Mr. Bailey was called as his 
only witness, no other witnesses being unavailable under the 
circumstances. (See Tr. 307, 424.) Bailey's testimony was directed 
to the facts surrounding the agreement by which Bailey was to 
receive and hold the Biochem stock. The government called as 
rebuttal witness Assistant United States Attorney Gregory Miller. 
He testified at length about the government's understandings and 
assumptions about the agreement, the absence of documentation of 
it, and various meetings and conversations, including an 
unrecorded conference in Judge Paul's chambers (Tr. 321, 334, 
375-79), in which terms of the agreement were discussed.  
 
In his closing argument, Bailey's counsel recounted efforts made to 
comply with the Court's prior directive, including the involvement 
of an accounting firm to produce the accounting demanded by the 
court. (Tr. 412-13.) Counsel frankly stated that the process of 
compliance, while underway, was not completed. It had not been 
possible in the time available to extract the shares from 
Switzerland, to identify or produce assets that may have been 
purchased with proceeds from the sale or encumbrance of the 
stock, or to obtain all the records. (Tr. 412-20.) Moreover, Bailey 
had been legitimately unavailable to give full-time effort to the 
cause due to his obligations to a client facing trial in the United 
States District Court for the Southern District of New York in a 
life-count murder case. (Tr. 413, 415, 418.)  
 
Counsel, however, repeatedly stated Bailey's willingness and 
intention to undertake diligently to achieve compliance. (Tr. 414 
("He will undertake any task reasonably put to him to get the 
shares back." "[H]e has expressed * * * his willingness to abide by 
the Court order."), 415 ("I place on the record that Mr. Bailey will 
and I will undertake whatever steps we are directed to undertake * 
* *."), 416 ("And I represent to the Court now * * * that he will 
provide Your Honor with the electronic banking data that 
constitutes the records * * *."), 417 ("[H]e is willing to do 
whatever is needed to repatriate the shares from Switzerland;" 
"[H]e is willing to provide books and records"), 428 ("So, I just * * 
* say to the Court, Mr. Bailey will provide compliance; I will 
provide compliance.").) In light of these representations, counsel 
pointed out, "it's a little extreme to say that his willingness to 
produce the required material, as expressed to the Court now, is so 
willfully disobedient that it requires the sanction of contempt, 
much less incarceration." (Tr. 418.)  
 
Despite Mr. Bailey's willingness to comply, the court issued its 
order of contempt.  
 
The Court's Order of Civil Contempt 
 
The Court's Order of Civil Contempt finds Mr. Bailey in contempt 
for his failure to produce the documents and accountings 
previously ordered or to show his legal inability to do so. For such 
contempt, it orders him "sentenced to the Custody of the Attorney 
General for a period of six months", such sentence to commence 
on March 1, 1996, should he fail to purge himself of contempt. In 
order to purge himself of contempt, Mr. Bailey is not only ordered 
to produce the documents and accountings by February 29, but 
ordered to "produce the stocks themself". Further, to purge himself 
of contempt and avoid incarceration, Mr. Bailey is ordered by 
February 29 to "repay the approximately $3,000,000 that he has 
withdrawn from the Swiss account for his own personal expenses 
and attorneys fees".  
 
Bailey's Efforts to Comply 
 
Immediately after the Court's February 3 Order, Mr. Bailey and his 
counsel continued their efforts to produce a complete accounting of 
Mr. Bailey's expenditures since April, 1993, and to collect all 
documents relating to the stock and the expenditures of proceeds 
derived therefrom. They also commenced efforts to have the 
Biochem stock transferred from Credit Suisse and to raise in 
excess of $3 million. While those efforts are set forth in the 
affidavit of Michael R. Smith, Esq., which is included as part of 
Exhibit 6 attached hereto, they may be summarized as follows:  
 
A. Document Production 
 
On February 14, 1996, Mr. Bailey's counsel produced to the Court 
and the government thousands of pages of documents, including 
(a) the HUD-1 closing statement on the purchase of the home 
owned jointly by Mr. Bailey and his wife; (b) invoices and related 
documents showing expenditures by Mr. Bailey in connection with 
the properties the government asked him to maintain in France by 
using the Credit Suisse account; (c) all check registers, monthly 
statements and canceled checks from April 1994 through 
December 1995 for Mr. Bailey's money market account, for Mr. 
Bailey's personal account, for Mr. Bailey's law office account, and 
for the other subaccounts to which funds may have been 
transferred from the money market account and through the 
personal account; (d) the Credit Suisse statements then available in 
the United States; and (e) redacted records from Bailey, Fishman, 
Ferrin & Freeman showing Mr. Bailey's deposits into that law firm.  
 
On February 21, 1996, Mr. Bailey's counsel produced to the 
government all records in the possession of Mr. Bailey's Swiss 
counsel regarding the relevant Credit Suisse account, including 
monthly statements and backup documents showing sales, wire 
transfers, and pay orders.  
 
On February 23, 1996, Mr. Bailey's counsel produced two 
notebooks of records documenting expenditures incurred by Mr. 
Duboc and Mr. Bailey as well as an additional notebook containing 
miscellaneous documents reflecting expenditures incurred during 
the Duboc representation.  
 
After being notified by the government on February 23 that it 
sought additional documents, additional records were produced on 
February 27. Mr. Bailey and his counsel have indicated his 
willingness to provide all records that can be located responsive to 
the government's requests.  
 
B. The Accounting 
 
Mr. Bailey retained the services of Kenneth Barker, a C.P.A. with 
the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen, to perform an accounting. 
Mr. Barker has produced to the Court and the government a 
comprehensive accounting which traces funds from Mr. Bailey's 
Credit Suisse account to their ultimate disposition for any amounts 
in excess of $5000.  
 
C. The Return of the Stock from Switzerland  
 
In addition, Mr. Bailey sought through his Swiss counsel, Charles 
Poncet, to cause Credit Suisse to transfer the Biochem Pharma 
shares to the Court. Again, those efforts are set forth at some 
length in the affidavit of Michael R. Smith. (See Exhibit 6.) These 
efforts included, through motions to the Court, to approve an 
account to which the stock could be transferred and arranging with 
Paine Webber for such an account in the United States. They also 
included dealing with a freeze order placed on the Credit Suisse 
account by Mr. Duboc's lawyers and a freeze order placed upon the 
account by Swiss prosecutors.  
 
Despite the obstacles presented by language, distance, time zones, 
freeze orders, obscure banking laws and regulations, as of February 
27, 164,00 shares of Biochem Pharma stock have been released by 
Credit Suisse for transfer. These shares have an approximate 
present value of $7 million.  
 
The approximate remaining 240,000 shares, however, are subject 
to a $2.3 million lien of Credit Suisse. That $2.3 million lien was 
imposed on the shares prior to January, 1996, for withdrawals 
made by Mr. Bailey from the account in 1994 and 1995. While Mr. 
Bailey and his attorneys have sought authorization from the 
government and the Court to authorize Credit Suisse to sell some 
shares in order to discharge the lien and to transfer the remainder to 
the Paine Webber account, the United States has objected and the 
Court has not approved such action. While this would have 
produced a transfer of stock valued at approximately $15 million, 
no further stock will be transferred by Credit Suisse unless and 
until they are authorized to discharge their lien.  
 
D. Depositing Approximately $3 million Into the Court Registry  
 
As set forth again in the affidavit of Michael R. Smith, Mr. Bailey 
has made all reasonable efforts to raise money not only to deposit 
with the Court, but to pay off the Credit Suisse lien. The vast bulk 
of Mr. Bailey's net worth consists of the value of boats and aircraft 
owned by a Subchapter S corporation which he wholly owns. 
These assets have equity of somewhat over $2 million. Based upon 
his net worth, Mr. Bailey has repeatedly sought to borrow money 
from banks and other conventional lenders, to no avail. He has 
contacted numerous individuals with the aim of obtaining personal 
loans secured by his assets, also to no avail to date. While he has 
made inquiries regarding sale of-the assets, given their nature, they 
will take time to sell, at least for anything close to their real value. 
Given the failure of all possible avenues to realize money from his 
present assets sufficient to purge himself of contempt, Mr. Bailey 
has offered to provide the Court with the titles to these and other 
assets, as well as to take any steps the Court requires. He simply 
does not have the money and has not, despite all reasonable efforts, 
been able to raise the money by financing based essentially on 
boats and airplanes as collateral.  
 
Hearing of February 27-28 
 
On February 23, Mr. Bailey requested by motion that the Court 
hold a status conference and hearing. On Monday, February 26, 
Mr. Bailey filed his Motion Not to Execute on Order of 
Incarceration and to Provide Additional Time For Compliance, 
attached hereto as Exhibit 6. The hearings on this motion 
commenced on Tuesday, February 27 were continued all day 
February 28.  
 
Unfortunately, there is no transcript of the hearings at this time. 
Indeed, given the emergency nature of this motion, there will be no 
transcript for this Court's consideration prior to the end of business 
on March 1, the time scheduled for Mr. Bailey to report for his 
imprisonment. However, because of the importance of the evidence 
taken at these hearings, we describe them below.  
 
Four witnesses testified to Mr. Bailey's compliance with the 
Court's order of civil contempt and to explain his need for an 
additional 21 days to raise the millions of dollars ordered to be 
placed in the court registry. They were Michael R. Smith, his 
attorney, Kenneth Barker, the Arthur Andersen accountant, Philip 
Vitello, a lawyer and international businessman who is an expert in 
the liquidation of assets, and Mr. Bailey.  
 
Mr. Smith testified at length to the matters set forth in his affidavit 
regarding Bailey's document production and other matters. As he 
established, no documents in Mr. Bailey's possession, custody, or 
control that are either within the scope of the Court's order or the 
government's request have been intentionally withheld. Rather, 
every potentially relevant piece of paper, over ten thousand pages, 
have been produced. While the government at the hearing pointed 
to a handful of peripheral documents not yet produced that are 
mentioned in the records already produced, there can be no dispute 
based upon Mr. Smith's testimony that Mr. Bailey has made every 
reasonable effort to comply with the document production 
requirements of the Court's Order of Civil Contempt.  
 
Mr. Smith also testified regarding the efforts made to transfer the 
Biochem Pharma shares from Credit Suisse. These included the 
efforts in a short period to overcome the hurdles imposed by the 
Duboc freeze order, the freeze order obtained by the Swiss 
prosecutor, and the pre-existing Credit Suisse lien. To date, Mr. 
Bailey has succeeded in obtaining the transfer of 164,000 shares. 
Mr. Smith also testified about the Credit Suisse lien and how the 
transfer of the remaining shares is contingent on the release of the 
lien. The release of the lien is, of course, only a matter of money; if 
Mr. Bailey could pay off the lien, the Swiss would release the 
remaining 400,000 shares.  
 
Mr. Barker submitted his detailed accounting and testified at length 
regarding the expenditures made by Mr. Bailey for 1994, 1995 and 
the first month of 1996. In effect, he expanded on the brief 
accounting he had performed prior to the hearings of February 2 
and 3. The accounting was both massive and detailed. Indeed, the 
government did not seek to attack or discredit the accounting in 
any fashion. Rather, the government appeared at the hearings to be 
completely satisfied with the accounting presented.  
 
Mr. Vitello testified to the impossibility of liquidating Mr. Bailey's 
primary assets in the time available under the Court's order and 
further testified to the orderly procedures that would be necessary 
to properly liquidate the properties. He also testified to the virtual 
impossibility of obtaining financing in the time frame set forth by 
the Court's order. Mr. Vitello's testimony was not challenged in 
any meaningful manner.  
 
Mr. Bailey also testified at length. Most critically. he testified that 
he would pledge turn over to the Court. or otherwise alienate every 
asset he had accumulated over his lifetime including his home. to 
comply with the Court's order.  
 
The government's position, presented through its witness, Assistant 
United States Attorney Miller, and through its cross examination of 
Bailey, was that Bailey deserved to be punished. According to the 
government, Bailey deserved to be incarcerated not because he had 
failed to prove that he had taken all reasonable steps to comply 
with the contempt order, but because he had written checks for 
personal expenses and legal fees prior to February 3, the date the 
Court signed the contempt order. Apparently, these expenditures 
violated a freeze order entered by the court in January, of which 
both Mr. Bailey and his counsel Mr. Smith testified they were 
unaware. In other words, the government's position at the hearings 
was that Mr. Bailey had failed to comply with a court order other 
than the contempt order and, therefore, could and should be 
incarcerated for this newly alleged violation.  
 
On February 29, 1996, the District Court entered its order denying 
Mr. Bailey's request for a 21-day extension. The Order, attached 
hereto, requires incarceration to begin at 5:00 p.m. on February 29, 
1996, but that has been orally modified to 10:00 a.m. On 
tomorrow, March 1, 1996. The Order, on the last day of possible 
compliance, announces new monetary obligations, reducing the 
obligation to pay $5.3 million to an obligation to pay $2.3 million 
to Credit Suisse to release shares and to pay $700,000 to the court. 
The court has held that incarceration is required to compel the 
production of any documents that remain outstanding, although 
none were specified. Finally, the court suggested that the earlier 6-
month prison sentence actually is subject to purge at any time. The 
court gave Mr. Bailey less than twenty-four hours to comply with 
this reconstruction of the earlier order. Notably, half of the order 
contains criticism of Mr. Bailey's conduct before the civil contempt 
order signed January 3, 1996, and compliance with the civil 
contempt order, such that the order is infused with the feel of 
affront and punishment, not a proper evaluation of compliance and 
coercion.  
 
The Denial of the Motion to Stay Pending Appeal by the District 
Court  
 
Mr. Bailey moved in the district court for a stay pending appeal on 
Wednesday, February 28, 1996. On Thursday, February 29, 1996, 
the district court denied the motion. A transcript reflecting the 
order, delivered orally, is attached.  
 
ARGUMENT 
 
Standard for Granting a Stay 
 
A motion for stay pending appeal requires consideration of four 
factors:  
 
1) the movant is likely to prevail on the merits of the appeal;  
 
2) absent a stay the movant will suffer irreparable damage;  
 
3) the adverse party will not suffer substantial harm from issuance 
of the stay; and  
 
4) granting the stay will cause no harm to the public interest.  
 
See In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Cohen), 975 F.2d 1488, 1492 
(llth Cir. 1992); Garcia-Mir v. Meese, 781 F.2d 1450, 1453 (llth 
Cir. 1986); Ruiz v. Estelle, 650 F.2d 555, 565 (5th Cir. Unit A 
1981) (binding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit), cert. denied, 460 
U.S. 1042 (1983); Dillard v. City of Greensboro, 870 F. Supp. 
1031, 1033 (M.D. Ala. 1994); Int'l Blvd of Boilermakers v. Local 
Lodge, 667 F. Supp. 870, 873 (M.D. Ga. 1987).  
 
The degree of likelihood of success on the merits that must be 
shown varies depending on how heavily the balance of equities 
favors the movant. Thus the motion may be granted upon a 
showing of "a substantial case on the merits" when "the balance of 
the equities [identified in factors 2, 3, and 4] weighs heavily in 
favor of granting the stay." United States v. Hamilton, 963 F.2d 
322, 323 (11th Cir. 1992); Garcia-Mir, 781 F.2d at 1453; Ruiz, 650 
F.2d at 565; In'tl Bhd of Boilermakers, 667 F. Supp. at 870.  
 
Where the other three factors favor interim relief, the court may 
grant a stay "if the movant has made a substantial case on the 
merits". Ruiz, 650 F.2d at 565 (quoting Washington Metropolitan 
Area Transit Comm'n v. Holiday Tours. Inc., 559 F.2d 891, 843 
(D.C. Cir. 1977)). "The court is not required to find that ultimate 
success by the movant is a mathematical probability, and indeed, * 
* * may grant a stay even though its own approach may be 
contrary to movant's view of the merits. n 1a- (quoting Holiday 
Tours).  
 
Thus, an order maintaining the status quo is appropriate when a 
serious legal question is presented and the other equities favor 
granting the stay. Id.  
 
A. Bailey Is Likely To Succeed on the Merits of His Appeal.  
 
 
Bailey has today (February 29, 1996) filed a Notice of Appeal with 
the clerk of the district court. This notice appeals from the 
February 7 Order of Civil Contempt; the February 21 denial of 
Bailey's Motion to Reconsider and Motion to Amend Judgment 
Pursuant to Rule 59 or for Relief from Judgment Pursuant to Rule 
60; and the February 28 denial of Bailey's Motion Not to Execute 
on Order of Incarceration and to Provide Additional Time for 
Compliance. The appeal will raise the following substantial issues.  
 
1. Bailey Has Demonstrated Present 
Inability To Comply 
 
"Present inability to comply" is a defense to contempt. CFTC v. 
Wellington Precious Metals. Inc., 950 F.2d 1525, 1529 (11th Cir. 
1992). The alleged contemnor must demonstrate that he has made 
'in good faith all reasonable efforts' to meet the terms of the court 
order he is seeking to avoid." Id. If sufficient showing is made, 
"[T]he burden shifts back to the initiating party * * *. The party 
seeking to show contempt, then, has the burden of proving ability 
to comply." Id. at 1529. "The party seeking the contempt citation 
retains the ultimate burden of proof." I:- (quoting In re Battaglia, 
653 F.2d 419, 423 (9th Cir. 1981)).  
 
Even under the constraints of the February 2-3 proceeding that 
preceded the contempt citation, Bailey made a substantial showing 
that inability was very much an issue. As to the production of 
stock, it was then established that Credit Suisse had a lien on it that 
prevented its transfer. As to the production of other assets obtained 
with proceeds of the stock, the creation of a full accounting, and 
the production of all related documentation, Bailey and counsel 
demonstrated that there simply had not been enough time to 
accomplish compliance. This could hardly have been surprising 
since the order to produce the stock, the other assets, and the 
documentation had only been in existence a total of five business 
days. Under these circumstances, the burden should have been on 
the government to prove ability to comply.  
 
The showing made by Bailey of his present inability to comply 
became even more starkly compelling during the hearing of 
February 27-28, at which Bailey sought in vain for relief from the 
imminent sentence of incarceration.  
 
Bailey produced a report and full accounting of all of his 
expenditures for the last two and a half years. The report and 
accounting were performed by Arthur Andersen & Company. The 
partner in charge, Kenneth Baker, testified at the hearing at length. 
The government did not contend that this accounting was less than 
sufficient.  
 
Bailey produced approximately 10,000 pages of documents and 
records, including bank records, American Express accounts, 
mortgage related documents and much more. He and one of his 
attorneys testified as to the extraordinary efforts that had been 
made to produce this documentation to the government in several 
waves of production in the preceding weeks. When the government 
midstream sent a detailed letter to Bailey's counsel listing a 
staggering array of records it wanted, the response was a 
redoubling of effort and further production to meet the 
government's specifications. By the time of the hearing, the 
government was able to point to only a small handful of additional 
documentation it thought should be produced, most of which had 
never been mentioned before by them or even thought of by 
Bailey. Bailey responded by promising to produce them in full, 
most of which has already been accomplished.  
 
As to the Biochem stock, Bailey demonstrated that he had 
succeeded, through exceptional determination, in persuading 
Credit Suisse to release 164,000 shares worth some seven million 
dollars. Credit Suisse refused to release the rest held under its lien.  
 
The lien secures a $2.3 million credit. Bailey repeatedly sought 
agreement from the government to permit him to direct Credit 
Suisse to sell $2.3 million worth of shares so that all the remaining 
shares could be returned (about 16 million dollars worth). See 
Bailey's Memorandum In Support of Motion to Execute at p. 26 
through 30. See Exhibit 6.  
 
Bailey presented proof that his cash accounts total about $50,000, 
not many millions. His net worth is represented by boats and 
planes held by a Subchapter S corporation. He testified, and he 
presented testimony from a financing expert he engaged to help 
him seek a way of packaging all his assets to raise cash of that 
magnitude, about efforts made to obtain such funds. The expert 
testified that it was simply impossible in the span of at most twenty 
business days to put together such a complicated financing 
transaction or to realize substantial proceeds from a fire sale.  
 
No other means of compliance being available, Bailey told the 
court, in an act of utter compliance, that he was willing 
immediately to pledge or turn over to the court all his assets, every 
item of value he has accumulated in his lifetime.  
 
There being copious evidence of unstinting compliance efforts, 
actual compliance on all requirements it was possible to meet, 
detailed and unrebutted testimony from Bailey and a financing 
expert establishing present inability to raise the sum of $3.0 
million, and Bailey's offer of his entire net worth in pledge to the 
court, a dispassionate tribunal reviewing this record cannot uphold 
the contempt finding in this case.  
 
2. The Imposition of the Contempt Citation in this. Case Did Not 
Comport With the Requirements of Due Process  
 
The imposition of the initial contempt citation in this case did not 
comport with the requirements of due process. Summary contempt 
is available only to "address contumacious conduct which is 
committed fully within the presence of the court. n United States v. 
KS & W Offshore Engineering. Inc., 932 F.2d 906, 909 (11th Cir. 
1991). Such conduct, for example, disruptive behavior in the 
courtroom, is denoted "direct contempt" and is considered 
amenable to summary adjudication "to maintain order in the 
courtroom and the integrity of the trial process." International 
Union. UMW v. Bagwell, U.S. , , 114 S. Ct. 2552, 2559-60 (1994); 
see KS & W Offshore, 932 F.2d at 909 ("such summary powers are 
essential for the maintenance of control within the courtroom"). It 
is only in these circumstances that summary proceedings "have 
been tolerated." Maxwell, 114 S. Ct. at 2560.  
 
Other contempts, including the failure to produce items or 
documents in court, are treated as "indirect" contempts that can be 
sanctioned only upon the provision of adequate notice and 
opportunity to defend. See, Bagwell, 114 S. Ct. at 2560 ("summary 
adjudication of indirect contempt is prohibited"); FDIC v. 
LeGrand, 43 F.3d 163, 166 (5th Cir. 1996) (failure to produce tax 
returns in court sanctioned after motion for contempt, show cause 
order and contempt hearing); Citronelle-Mobile Gathering Inc. v. 
Watkins, 943 F.2d 1297, 1300-1301 (lath Cir. 1991) (failure to 
return assets to court's jurisdiction sanctioned after motion for 
contempt, show cause order and contempt hearing).  
 
The procedural requirements appurtenant to the imposition of civil 
contempt sanctions for indirect contempts have been elaborated by 
the Eleventh Circuit in Mercy v. Mitchell, 908 F.2d 763 (llth Cir. 
1990). "Although a district court has a certain amount of discretion 
in fashioning civil contempt sanctions and the procedure by which 
those sanctions are imposed, the court must stay within the bounds 
of due process." 908 F.2d at 766.  
 
"[D]ue process requires, with very few exceptions, that the 
defendant (1) be informed, through a show-cause order, of his 
purportedly contumacious conduct, and (2) be given a hearing at 
which he can be represented by counsel, call witnesses, and testify 
in order to show cause why he should not be held in contempt." Id. 
at 767.  
 
The due process framework contemplates an orderly adjudication 
in several stages:  
 
a) There is first "a court order that requires the defendant to act in 
some defined manner." Mercer, 908 F.2d at 768. The defendant 
must have actual knowledge of the order and the order must be 
sufficiently specific to be enforceable. Hazen v. Reagan, 16 F.3d 
921, 924 (8th Cir. 1994).  
 
b) "The defendant then acts, or refuses to act, in violation of the 
order." Mercer, 908 F.2d at 768.  
 
c) The plaintiff then "requests the court to order the defendant to 
show cause why he should not be held in contempt and sanctioned 
until he complies." Mercer, 908 F.2d at 768. Typically, this is 
accomplished by a motion served upon the defendant. See id. at 
767 n.7. The motion serves as first notice that contempt is in issue.  
 
d) "If the court finds that the conduct as alleged would violate the 
prior order, it enters an order requiring the defendant to show cause 
why he should not be held in contempt and conducts a hearing on 
the matter." Mercer 908 F.2d at 768. The showcause order is a 
"required element of civil contempt proceedings." Id. at 767 n.5. 
The court must enter a show-cause order and conduct a hearing 
"whether or not it is requested to do so by defendant." Id. at 767 
n.7.  
 
e) "At the hearing, the defendant is allowed to show either that he 
did not violate the court order or that he was excused from 
complying.  Mercer, 908 F.2d at 768. The court must allow the 
defendant an opportunity to request modification of the order based 
on circumstances that would make strict enforcement of the order 
unjust. Id. at 768, 769.  
 
f) If the court "concludes that the order should not be modified and 
that the defendant did not comply with the order, then the court 
may hold him in contempt and impose sanctions designed to 
ensure compliance." Mercer, 908 F.2d at 768.  
 
The proceedings in this case bear no resemblance to the typical 
procedure described by the Eleventh Circuit, and there is no reason 
whatsoever that they could not have been conducted in conformity 
with the normal procedural framework.  
 
There was no show-cause order. Absence of this "required 
elements alone mandates reversal. Mercer 908 F.2d at 768, 769 
(notice and hearing are required elements of due process; contempt 
order vacated where court did not enter a show-cause order or 
conduct a hearing); see Citronelle-Mobile Gathering. Inc., 943 
F.2d at 1034 (due process requires that the court inform the alleged 
contemnor of the contemptuous conduct and provide a hearing).  
 
There was no notice, by motion or court order, that the February 2 
hearing would in fact be a contempt hearing. Neither Bailey nor 
defense counsel could have perceived, prior to going to Ocala and 
finding themselves in the midst of it, that Bailey was to be on trial, 
then and there, for contempt.  
 
When the Court finally, on Friday night, uttered the words "show 
cause", there was practically speaking no opportunity to mount a 
meaningful defense by Saturday morning. Nor was there any 
reason that the Court could not have issued a real show-cause order 
at that time setting the contempt hearing for a reasonable time in 
the future. See Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965) (to 
satisfy due process, hearing must be at meaningful time and in 
meaningful manner).  
 
Nor was Bailey given a reasonable opportunity to establish 
grounds to request a modification of the order. Having had just five 
days business notice of the hearing, having counsel for only a brief 
period of time, and being completely preoccupied with the defense 
of a life-count murder case in New York, Bailey was not in a 
position to present a meaningful defense. Potential witnesses on 
compliance issues, on matters regarding the Swiss shares and the 
obstacles to their transfer, and on the complications of producing 
an accounting could not be called. Not knowing prior to the 
hearing of its true nature, neither Bailey nor counsel could have 
perceived the need for such proof to defend against a contempt. 
Clearly, a measured contempt proceeding with an order to show 
cause and a proper hearing in conformance with the requirements 
of Mercer would have allowed Bailey the opportunity to make a 
meaningful presentation to the Court which reasonably would have 
materially affected the court's findings, the content of its order, and 
its decision whether to issue a contempt citation at all.  
 
3. It Was Error to Require Bailey to "Repay" Funds in Order to 
Purge Contempt and Error to Include Other Purge Conditions Not 
Tied to the Specified Act of Contempt       
 
The February contempt order contained two purge clauses, both of 
which are invalid. One of them imposes a wholly new undertaking 
-- the "repayment" of $3 million. The other, requiring the 
production of stock, fails to tie the purge obligation strictly to the 
purview of the contempt delineated in the order. (On February 29, 
1996, the Court modified these to require a $2.3 million payment 
to Credit Suisse and a $700,000 payment to the court.)  
 
The fundamental premise in a contempt proceeding is that there is 
an outstanding, prior order for the defendant to do some act, and 
the outstanding order has been violated. See CFTC v. Wellington 
Previous Metals. Inc., 950 F.2d 1525, 1528 (llth Cir. 1992) (must 
be shown that defendant "violated an outstanding court order"), 
cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 66. Coercive sanctions may be applied to 
cause the defendant "to conform to the terms required in the order." 
International Union. UMW v. Bagwell, U.S. , 114 S. Ct. 2552, 
2557 (1994). The whole purpose is to compel obedience with the 
court's outstanding order.  
 
The obvious corollary to these basic concepts of contempt is that a 
person cannot be held in contempt for failing to do something that 
he was not in fact required to do by the outstanding order, nor, 
logically, can the conditions to purge exceed the requisites of the 
original order. See Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 
1 F.3d 1274, 1289 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (reversing contempt judgment 
against agencies based in part on their failure to promulgate new 
regulations where outstanding court order did not contain direct 
order for them to do so).  
 
In this case, the court has imposed a new and additional affirmative 
duty, one that was not an element of any prior outstanding order. 
The court has obligated Bailey to raise and Repay" $3 million, an 
entirely new requirement.  
 
At the February 2-3 hearing, Bailey testified that the Biochem 
stock, worth at the time of its transfer to him about $6 million, had 
appreciated to approximately $24 million, and that some $3 million 
of proceeds from it had been taken into his bank account in Florida 
and spent in accordance with his understanding of his rights to it 
under his agreement with the government. The liquidated shares 
obviously could not be returned to the court as contemplated by the 
outstanding January 25 order.  
 
Apprised of these facts at the hearing, the court simply appended a 
new affirmative requirement that Bailey now raise and "repay" $3 
million in cash. In the court's February 29, 1996 order, the $3.0 
million is structured so that $2.3 million is paid to Credit Suisse 
and $700,000 to the court, the overall payment obligation reduced 
thereby from $5.3 million to $3.0 million. This requirement 
appeared for the first time in the Order of Civil Contempt, read 
from the bench at the close of the hearing on Saturday, February 3. 
As there was no pre-existing order requiring Bailey to "repay" 
spent funds, the purge clause, which imposes an obligation to raise 
$3 million in less than four weeks, is not directed at effectuating 
compliance with the terms of any outstanding order. It is not a 
valid purge clause precisely because it exceeds the bounds of any 
outstanding order.  
 
Beyond that, the obligation to deposit $3 million with the Court is 
in reality a new substantive order, requiring Bailey to undertake a 
new task. Then, if he fails in that task, he is automatically subject 
to incarceration by operation of the final paragraph of the Order -- 
with no order to show cause, no hearing, no opportunity to defend, 
no due process whatsoever. The provision is plainly 
unconstitutional and cannot be enforced. See Mercer v. Mitchell, 
908 F.2d 763, 769-70 (llth Cir. 1990) (sanctions imposed without 
due process must be vacated).  
 
The contempt order also directs that Mr. Bailey may purge himself 
of contempt by producing "the stocks themselves" by February 29. 
This clause is defective for a different reason. The Order of Civil 
Contempt specifically circumscribes the finding of contempt, 
limiting it to the failure to produce "documents and accountings":  
 
It is clear, and the court so finds, that Mr. Bailey has not 
demonstrated any good reason as to why he did not produce the 
requested documents and accountings as ordered, nor has he shown 
a good faith effort to comply therewith. Having failed to either 
produce the documents, shown his legal inability to do so, or 
demonstrate a good faith effort at compliance, Mr. Bailey is 
sentenced to the custody of the Attorney General for a period of six 
months. * * *  
 
(Order at 4.) Bailey was not cited for contempt for failing to return 
the Biochem stock.  
 
4. The Sanction Imposed Must Be Vacated Because It Is Criminal. 
Not Civil. in Nature  The district court originally sentenced Mr. 
Bailey for a determinate six-month sentence. On February 29, 
1996, it suggested that the earlier order may not mean what it says 
and may permit purging at any time.  
 
For a contempt sanction to be categorized as civil it must remain 
conditional and subject to cure at all times. Imprisonment for a 
fixed term thus is civil in nature only where the defendant can 
obtain early release at any point in the term through compliance. 
International Union. UMW v. Bagwell, _ U.S. 114 S. Ct. 2552, 
2558 (citing Shillitani v. United States, 384 U.S. 364, 370 n.6 
(1966)). Because the defendant remains always able to obtain his 
release, he "thus 'carries the keys of his prison in his own pocket'." 
Bagwell, 114 S. Ct. at 2558 (quoting Gompers v. Bucks Stove & 
Range Co., 221 U.S. 418, 442 (1911)). On the other hand a fixed 
sentence of imprisonment is criminal if the defendant "cannot 
avoid or abbreviate the confinement through later compliance." 
Bagwell, 114 S. Ct. at 2558.  
 
While the sanction in this case has some civil characteristics in that 
Bailey has the ability to purge during the period the sentence is 
suspended, i.e., until February 29, it thereafter may be criminal in 
that an unconditional six-month sentence begins. When a contempt 
order contains both a criminal and a civil dimension, it must be 
classified as a criminal contempt order for purposes of review. 
Bagwell, 114 S. Ct. at 2561; FDIC v. LeGrand, 43 F.3d 163, 168 
(5th Cir. 1995). (By order of February 29, 1996, the district court 
suggested that the determinate six-month sentence is actually 
subject to purge, although that does not appear on the face of the 
earlier order.)  
 
"Criminal contempt sanctions are entitled to full criminal process." 
Bagwell, 114 S. Ct. at 2560. "Criminal penalties may not be 
imposed on someone who has not been afforded the protections 
that the Constitution requires of such criminal proceedings." I:at 
2556 (quoting Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U.S. 624, 632 (1988)). These 
protections include notice of charges in the form of a show cause 
order specifically stating that the hearing will be a criminal 
contempt proceeding, LeGrand, 43 F.3d at 169; Lamar Financial 
Corp. v. Adams, 918 F.2d 564, 567 (5th Cir. 1990); assistance of 
counsel, Bagwell, 114 S. Ct. at 2557; a hearing and opportunity to 
present a defense, id.; proof beyond a reasonable doubt, i:.; United 
States v. Maynard, 933 F.2d 918, 920 (llth Cir. 1990); jury trial if 
imprisonment over six months could be involved, Bagwell, 114 S. 
Ct. at 2557, an impartial decisionmaker, LeGrand, 43 F.3d at 169 
n.6, and proof of criminal mens rea, Maynard, 918 F.2d at 920; 
Taberer v. Armstrong World Industries, Inc., 954 F.2d 888, 908 
(3d Cir. 1992); Krasnow v. Navarro, 909 F.2d 451, 452-53 (llth 
Cir. 1990).  
 
When a criminal contempt sanction is imposed without full 
criminal process, the sanction must be vacated, even if the sentence 
is never in fact executed. LeGrand, 43 F.2d at 169-70.  
 
5. The Court Erred in Failing to Recuse Itself  
 
The court could not properly sit as factfinder in this contempt 
proceeding and was required to recuse itself. Section 455(b) of 
Title 28 sets forth a series of circumstances in which a federal 
judge must be disqualified. This section "delineates specific 
circumstances where recusal is mandated". Liteky v. United States, 
114 S. Ct. 1147, 1163 (1994)(Kennedy, J. concurring). A judge is 
under a self- enforcing obligation to recuse himself whenever 
proper grounds exist, and the statute requires judges to resolve any 
doubts they may have in favor of disqualification. United States v. 
Kelly, 888 F.2d 732,744 (llth Cir. 1989). Among the circumstances 
requiring disqualification are when a judge has "personal 
knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the 
proceeding" and when he is "likely to be a material witness in the 
proceeding". 28 U.S.C.    455(b)(1) and (b)(5)(iv). Because judges 
normally recuse themselves whenever they may be required to be a 
witness at an evidentiary hearing, there are few appellate court 
decisions dealing with these circumstances. See, e.g:, United States 
v. Crowell, 359 F. Supp. 489, 490 n.6 (M.D. Fla. 1973) (original 
trial judge recused himself because he might be a witness at an 
evidentiary hearing).  
 
This case had the extraordinary feature of a material, off the record 
discussion involving the judge, about a central issue in dispute, the 
nature of the agreement between Bailey and the government. That 
conversation was a critical evidentiary element and the judge was a 
party, and witness, to it. Bailey brought the matter to the court's 
attention through a disqualification motion filed on the morning of 
February 2, prior to the hearing in which that very discussion 
would be in issue. In spite of the unambiguous dictates of the 
controlling law, the judge denied the motion without statement of 
reasons.  
 
It was clear error for the court to adjudicate a matter in which it 
was a material witness to off the record events in dispute at the 
hearing.  
 
6. Bailey Was Improperly Denied the Right to a Trial by Jury  
 
Bailey was entitled to a jury trial as provided in 21 U.S.C.   882(b). 
Subchapter I ("Control and Enforcements, 21 U.S.C.    801-904) of 
Chapter 13 ("Drug Abuse Prevention and Control") of Title 21 of 
the United States Code contains a grant of jurisdiction for 
injunctive enforcement of the provisions of that Subchapter:  
 
Jurisdiction   
 
(a) The district courts of the United States and all courts exercising 
general jurisdiction in the territories and possessions of the United 
States shall have jurisdiction in proceedings in accordance with the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to enjoin violations of this 
chapter.  
 
21 U.S.C.   853(e)(1). 
 
Amongst the forms of injunction available under this grant of 
jurisdiction are "restraining order[s] or injunction[s] to preserve the 
availability of property described in [Section 853(a)] for forfeitures 
21 U.S.C.   853 (3)(1). The property at issue in this case, the 
Biochem stock, or other assets into which it was converted, is 
alleged to be forfeitable because it constitutes or derives from drug 
trafficking proceedings. As such it would be property forfeitable 
under Section 853(a)(1).  
 
The express foundation for the government's January 22, 1996 
"Emergency Motion to Surrender Property" is that the stock is 
"forfeitable property that Claude Duboc "obtained as a result of 
involvement in illegal drug trafficking activities and transferred to 
Bailey. That was, as well, the position pressed by the government 
at the February 2-3, 1996 hearing. (E.g;, Tr. at 32-33.)  
 
The court's January 25 order in response to the government's 
motion to surrender property required Bailey to return the stock, or 
other assets, to the court. This order was quite plainly a mandatory 
restraint or injunction intended "to preserve the availability of 
property * * * for forfeitures as contemplated by 21 U.S.C.   
853(e)(1).  
 
Bailey filed prior to the hearing a motion and demand for a jury 
trial. Counsel at the outset of the hearing pointed out that the 
proceeding appeared to be a proceeding ancillary to a forfeiture 
and reiterated the demand for a jury. (Tr. at 34, 36.) The court did 
not grant a jury trial and ultimately imposed a contempt citation 
based, inter alia, on Bailey's failure to turn over the allegedly 
forfeitable property.  
 
Section 882(b) of Title 21 specifically provides that contempt 
proceedings for violation of injunctive orders issued pursuant to 
the grant of jurisdiction in Section 882(a) carry with them the right 
to a jury:  
 
Jury Trial 
 
(b) In case of an alleged violation of an injunction or restraining 
order issued under this section, trial shall, upon demand of the 
accused, be by a jury in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure.  
 
21 U.S.C.   882(b). 
 
Because Bailey was denied the right to trial by jury, the contempt 
order must be vacated.  
 
B. Bailey Will Be Irreparably Harmed If No Stay is Granted "An 
injury is irreparable 'if it cannot be undone through monetary 
remedies.' Dillard v. City of Greensboro, 870 F. Supp. 1031 (M.D. 
Ala. 1994) (quoting Cate v. Oldham, 707 F.2d 1176, 1189 (llth Cir. 
1983)).  
 
Respondent is subject to incarceration if the order is executed. 
Incarceration, whether for six months, six weeks, six days, or six 
hours, is unquestionably a profound and irreparable injury. Indeed 
as the Eleventh Circuit has held, "[t]here is, perhaps, no injury 
more substantial and less reparable than improper denial of the 
right to liberty." Garcia-Mir, 781 F.2d at 1455.  
 
C. There Will Be No Substantial Harm to the Government if a Stay 
is Granted         
 
As regards the issuance of a stay in this case, the purpose of which 
would be merely to maintain the status quo pending appeal, the 
government's sole material interest is the preservation of the assets 
to which it makes claim. Where there is no imminent threat of 
dissipation of the disputed assets, the government is in no way 
prejudiced by a stay.  
 
There is no dispute that Bailey did, as he understood he had the 
right to do under his agreement with the government, use some 
proceeds from the Biochem stock account in 1994 and 1995, 
before the government's contrary position was asserted. There is 
also no dispute that since the parameters of the controversy have 
come into focus, Bailey has endeavored diligently to replace spent 
funds and has accomplished the return of some of the shares. 
Indeed, these efforts have yielded the return of $7 million worth of 
shares -- more than the value of what Bailey received in the first 
place. The rest of the shares remain safely in the custody of Credit 
Suisse. Moreover, Bailey has offered to pledge or transfer to the 
court every asset he owns. There being no threat that the stock or 
any other assets will be dissipated during the pendency of this 
appeal, there is no substantial harm to the government in the grant 
of the stay.  
 
Further, it must be noted that incarceration in the present 
circumstances has no real continuing coercive effect. Bailey has 
already done as much as he could do in the time permitted to 
restore the corpus of stock and monies to the possession of the 
court, and he and counsel have repeatedly represented that 
continuing efforts will be made to maximize compliance. He has 
offered all his worldly assets. Under these circumstances, 
imprisonment would be punitive, not coercive, and hence improper 
in a civil contempt case, and would only serve to impede further 
efforts at compliance.  
 
D. No Harm to the Public Interest 
 
Where the government is a party, the public interest often 
coincides, at least in part, with the government's interests. The 
public also has an interest in the safety of the assets, and in an 
appropriate case, in the coercive function of a contempt sanction. 
But as shown, in this case the interest in preservation is secure and 
the coercive purpose of incarceration is absent. Indeed, 
incarceration would likely only inhibit compliance.  
 
There are also individual third-party interests involved here. Bailey 
is a criminal defense lawyer whose clients, many of whom face the 
most serious of criminal charges, rely on him to attend to their 
interests. Incarcerating Bailey would only harm these uninvolved 
third parties. Since incarceration here would serve no legitimate 
function, the interest of these uninvolved third parties in Bailey's 
liberty during the pendency of this appeal should weigh 
prominently in the consideration of the motion for stay.  
 
The public interest will be best served by an orderly, and if 
necessary, expedited resolution of the contempt issue on this 
appeal, and then of the important underlying issues. The public has 
a strong interest in fair and comprehensive judicial scrutiny of the 
actions of those who serve it in the agencies of law enforcement. 
Here there are significant issues of government conduct that figure 
heavily in the mix when considering whether Bailey should be 
immediately subject to the opprobrium and deprivation of liberty 
presently threatened.  
 
The government's position is that it parked with Bailey property 
that was forfeitable as the proceeds of illegal narcotics activity, 
from which Bailey would be paid legal fees.  
 
If this is true, the government failed to conform its conduct to 
Supreme Court directives in Caplin & Drysdale v. United States, 
and United States v. Monsanto, 491 U.S. 617 (1989). Those cases 
proscribe the use of forfeitable funds for payment of legal fees. The 
"relation back" doctrine makes the assets obtained with unlawfully 
derived proceeds government property at the time they are 
unlawfully obtained. Thereafter, such forfeitable property cannot 
be used for payment of legal fees.  
 
In an effort to deal with a variety of circumstances surrounding the 
complexities of this doctrine, the Department of Justice has set 
forth policy and guidelines in an extensive policy and guideline 
statement. See generally, 9- 111.100, et sea. These policy 
statement and guidelines, which were in effect in April of 1994, 
require such things as approval by the Assistant Attorney General, 
Criminal Division, before any asset transfer to an attorney as a fee 
for legal services may be forfeited (9-111.300); similar approval in 
the event civil forfeiture proceedings are directed at an asset 
transfer to an attorney for legal fees (9-111.300); the approval of 
the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, for any "formal 
or informal, written, or oral agreements made regarding the 
exemption of an asset transfer to an attorney as fees for legal 
services from forfeiture (9-111.300). The guidelines specifically 
require careful review by the Department of Justice for these kinds 
of agreements (9-111.400). They require "written notice" of the 
government's intention to seek forfeiture of an asset made available 
to an attorney for payment of legal fees (9111.530). They require 
senior Departmental approval before attorney fee records are 
subpoenaed or otherwise sought by the government (9-111.620). 
Most significantly, the guidelines in 9-111.700 make clear that, 
when the government provides an asset for payment of legal fees, 
of necessity that decision carries with it a finding that "reasonable 
grounds to believe that the particular asset is not subject to 
forfeiture exist.  
 
The government, therefore, cannot as a matter of Supreme Court 
doctrine and its own regulations make available forfeitable assets 
for payment of legal fees. Its decision to make available an asset 
for payment of legal fees ineluctably carries a finding that the asset 
is not subject to forfeiture, not to be forfeitable, and is otherwise 
free of any future claim. For the government to act otherwise 
would be a breach of Caplin & Drysdale and Monsanto, a violation 
of its internal guidelines, and a violation of common sense and 
logic.  
 
Put simply, the government's "understanding" of the agreement 
here is an understanding profoundly at odds with Supreme Court 
doctrine and its own guidelines. One need only read Guideline 9-
111.700 to see that the government cannot "park" forfeitable assets 
with an attorney for interim use as payment for his legal fees and 
thereafter for subsequent forfeiture. The transfer to an attorney, 
particularly if undertaken in fee simple, without written limitation, 
and without conduct thereafter evincing any ownership of a 
remainder interest in the property, profoundly disentitles the 
government from the claim it is now making.  
 
CONCLUSION 
 
For the foregoing reasons, this Court should issue a stay of the 
contempt judgment pending respondent's appeal.

IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS 
 
FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT 
 
No. 96-2280 
 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
 
Plaintiff-Appellee, 
 
versus 
 
CLAUDE LUIS DUBOC, aka 
 
HARRY SIMPSON, aka 
 
ANTHONY LARKIN, 
 
Defendant, 
 
F. LEE BAILEY, 
 
Appellant. 
 
Appeal from the United States District Court for the Northern 
District of Florida  
 
Before KRAVITCH, EDMONDSON and CARNES, Circuit 
Judges.  
 
PER CURIAM: 
 
Appellant F. Lee Bailey has filed an emergency motion for stay 
pending appeal. The district court has found Bailey to be in 
contempt and has ordered his incarceration: the incarceration was 
to begin 1 March. On 29 February, we temporarily stayed the order 
directing him to be incarcerated.   
 
 
Since 29 February, we have carefully examined the submissions 
from the parties (including briefs) and transcripts of hearings. And 
we have heard oral argument. We now lift our stay and remand to 
the district court for the limited purpose of setting the time and 
place for Bailey to report to the United States Marshal.  
 
Where the district court had discretion, we cannot say that it is 
plain now that the court abused this discretion. Particularly 
considering the number and nature of the district court hearings, 
considering the factual determinations underlying the district 
court's 29 February order, considering that credibility is a matter 
for the judicial officer who listens to and personally observes the 
witnesses, and considering the standard of review for factual 
determinations is under the clearly erroneous rule, we conclude 
that Bailey has shown less than a substantial likelihood of 
prevailing on the merits of his appeal. We also cannot say that the 
equities among the parties or the public interest weigh heavily in 
favor of the stay.  
 
The appeal on the merits in this case will be expedited. Appellant's 
brief on the merits shall be due not later than 19 March 1996. The 
appellee's brief shall be due within 10 days of the filing of the 
appellant's brief. Appellant then shall have 3 days to file a reply 
brief. The parties are reminded that we have already read 
substantial briefs; no need exists to repeat what has already been 
said. If the appeal is to be orally argued, the parties will be notified 
speedily.  
 
MOTION FOR STAY DENIED.

DARRELL A. CABEY, by his legal
guardian and proposed
conservator, SHIRLEY CABEY,

Plaintiff,

v.

BERNHARD HUGO GOETZ,

Defendant.


Index No. 6747-1985

COMPLAINT FOR COMPENSATORY
AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND
PERMANENT INJUNCTION


Plaintiff, by SHIRLEY CABEY, his legal guardian and proposed
conservator, complaining of the defendant herein, alleges as follows:

1. Plaintiff DARRELL A. CABEY is a Black youth, aged nineteen
years, who is presently in a comatose condition at St. Vincent's
Hospital in the City, County and State of New York, because of
defendant's actions as more fully set forth below. This action is
being maintained on his behalf by SHIRLEY CABEY, his mother
and legal guardian, who will shortly petition the appropriate court for
her appointment as his conservator pursuant to Sections 1201 et seq.,
Civil Practice Law and Rules (CPLR). Both plaintiff and his said
mother are residents of the County of Bronx, City and State of New
York, and are citizens of the United States.

2. Defendant BERNHARD HUGO GOETZ is a white male adult
who has just been indicted by a Grand Jury of the County of New
York on one felony and two misdemeanor charges for the illegal
possession of firearms. Upon information and belief, said defendant
is a resident of the City, County and State of New York, and is a
citizen of the United States.

County of Bronx, City and State of New York, and venue is
properly laid therein pursuant to Section 503, CPLR.

FOR A FIRST SEPARATE AND DISTINCT CAUSE OF

4. On December 22, 1984, plaintiff was a passenger on a
southbound No. 2 subway train on the Seventh Avenue IRT subway

companions were then riding.

7. Upon information and belief, on that date and at that time and
place, defendant was carrying a fully loaded holster, in violation of
the applicable laws of the City and State of New York and of the

8. Upon information and belief, defendant's weapon was loaded
with at least three (3) soft-nosed hollow point bullets--commonly
referred to as "dum dum" bullets--designed to cause a maximum of
serious physical injury and pain to a victim. Upon information and
belief, said ammunition is outlawed by both the City and State of
New York and the United States, and its use is prohibited in warfare
by international treaties and understandings.

namely Troy Canty, approached defendant and asked him for five
dollars ($5.00), whereupon defendant, without provocation or
advance warning, drew his weapon and shot said Canty, following
which he then opened fire upon the other Black youths, including
plaintiff. When plaintiff attempted to flee, defendant deliberately,
willfully and with malice aforethought, aimed at his back and fired
his weapon thereat, severing his spinal cord.

10. Defendant then fled from the subway car in which the aforesaid
incident had taken place, and left the City and State of New York,

and, upon information and belief, confessed and admitted to the
above actions on his part.

willfully, deliberately, intentionally, and with malice aforethought to
cause the death of or to inflict serious physical injury on plaintiff.

b. Upon information and belief, defendant later expressed regret
that he had run out of ammunition;

c. Upon information and belief, defendant later stated a desire to
gouge out the eyes of some or all of his victims;

d. Upon information and belief, defendant later expressed a regret
that he had not taken his car keys and gouged out the eyes of some or
all of his victims;

e. Upon information and belief, defendant later stated that he
behaved "visciously and savagely, just like a rat" toward his victims.

f. Upon information and belief, defendant had previously publicly
expressed racial epithets and slurs concerning Black and Hispanic
persons.

g. Upon information and belief, defendant has stated that he has no
remorse about the shooting.

FOR A SECOND SEPARATE AND DISTINCT CAUSE OF
ACTION:

13. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the paragraphs of the complaint

States, and, in particular, the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Thirteenth and
Fourteenth Amendments thereto, as well as the laws of the United
States, and, in particular, 42 U.S.C. Section 1981 et seq.

FOR A FIFTH SEPARATE AND DISTINCT CAUSE OF
ACTION:

20. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the paragraphs of the complaint
numbered and designated "1" through "12""14" through "15", "17"
and "19" as if they were more fully here set forth.

21. Defendant's actions, as set forth above, violated the civil rights
of plaintiff as guaranteed to him by the Constitution of the State of
New York and, in particular, Article I, Sections 1, 11, and, if
applicable, the Human Rights Law of the State of New York, Section
290 et seq., Executive Law.

22. Defendant's actions have caused plaintiff to suffer the following
damages, all or most of which are expected to be permanent:

a. paralysis of the lower extremeties;
b. an as yet undetermined amount of brain damage; c. enormous
and continuing pain and agony; and d. great emotional anguish.

never walk again Nigger." g. "I am writing to tell you how lucky
you are that you are paralyzed. Because being a Green Beret from
NAM, I'm on the same subway every day, had I had the same
oppurtunity [sic] to raise my gun to you, you would be dead!! Best
wishes."

24. With respect to the injunctive relief hereinafter demanded,
plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law.

WHEREFORE, plaintiff prays for the following relief from this
Court:

A. Compensatory damages in the amount of $25,000.000; B.
Punitive damages in the amount of $25,000,000; C. A declaratory

permanent injunction prohibiting defendant from using or possessing
firearms of any kind or sort whatsoever; and E. Such other and

An excerpt from "Hell Hath No Fury" by Joan Collins.</P>

<P><A HREF="contract.html">Contract Between Joan Collins and Random House</A><BR>
What did Joan Collins agree to when she signed a multi-million dollar book deal with Random House? Read the contract to find out.</P>

<P><A HREF="affirm2.html">Joan Collins Dec. 11 Affirmation</A><BR>
According to Joan Collins, she submitted the complete manuscript for "A Ruling Passion," on schedule. The manuscript follows the outline she devised with Random House editor Rosemary Cheetham, she said. But after Cheetham resigned, her new editor lost faith in the project and told her "nobody is interested" in the book's characters. To back out of the contract, the publisher created the ploy that she didn't finish her work on time, Collins said. In this Dec. 11, 1995 affirmation in support of motion for a summary judgment, Collins recounts her deteriorating relationship with her publisher.</P>

<P><A HREF="affirm1.html">Joan Collins Jan. 3 Affirmation</A><BR>
After topless photos of her appeared in The Globe in 1991, Joan Collins sued the tabloid newspaper for damages, claiming that she suffered such aggravation that she was unable to continue writing. Random House is trying to use this claim against her, maintaining that it is proof that she did not submit a complete manuscript for "A Ruling Passion." In this Jan. 3, 1996 affirmation Joan Collins says, "I now realize that I was mistaken when I made those statements."</P>

<P><A HREF="answer3.html">Joan Collins Amended Answer to Complaint</A><BR>
In this third amended answer to Random House's second complaint, Joan Collins and her production company claim that she submitted her manuscripts on or ahead of schedule even though Random House never provided the editorial assistance it was required to provide. Collins says she is entitled to paid advances and is countersuing for additional advances that she claims were never paid. The document was filed Nov. 30, 1995.</P>

<P><A HREF="answer2.html">Joan Collins' Answer to Complaint</A><BR>
This is Joan Collins' answer to the complaint in the Random House lawsuit. Her personal answer and the answer from her company were filed separately (see below).</P>

<P><A HREF="answer1.html">Answer from Joan Collins' Company</A><BR>
This is the answer from Joan Collins' company to the complaint in the Random House lawsuit. Included in this document are counter-claims against Random House and cross-claims against Ms. Collins' agent, Irving "Swifty" Lazar.</P>

This is the (second amended) complaint in the matter of Random House v. actress/author Joan Collins, wherein the publisher claims it is owed a refund of the advance money it paid Ms. Collins for her latest book, alleging that the manuscript she delivered was unusable.

<P>Famed San Francisco lawyer Melvin Belli filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Dec. 7, 1995, listing more than $400,000 owed to various unsecured creditors, including his retired secretary and the company that printed his 1993 Christmas cards. The following petition lists the creditors holding the 20 largest unsecured claims against him.

<P>In 1968, as a young, unproven director, Steven Spielberg received $10,000 to complete a film from producer Denis Hoffman. In exchange, Spielberg agreed to direct a future Hoffman film. Spielberg went on to become one of the most successful directors in history and would eventually buy out the contract. As thanks, Spielberg lent Hoffman the money to launch a gourmet doughnut business. But in this Oct. 24, 1995 complaint, Spielberg claims Hoffman continues to demand tens of millions of dollars from him as a result of the 1968 agreement. In addition, Hoffman never repaid the doughnut business loan.</P>

Attorneys for Plaintiffs Heights Investment Co.,
Inc. and Steven Spielberg




            SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

      FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES, NORTH 
CENTRAL DISTRICT



HEIGHTS INVESTMENT CO., INC.,
a corporation, and STEVEN
SPIELBERG,

          Plaintiffs,

     vs.

DENIS HOFFMAN and DOES 1
through 10, inclusive,

          Defendants


CASE NO.

COMPLAINT FOR:
(1) BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY;
AND
(2)DECLARATORY RELIEF

          Plaintiffs Heights Investment Co., Inc. ("Heights")
and Steven Spielberg ("Spielberg") (collectively "Plaintiffs")
allege as follows:

                      FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
            (By Heights For Breach of Fiduciary Duty)
          1.   At all material times, Heights was and is a
corporation authorized to do and doing business in the County of
Los Angeles, State of California, owned 100% by Spielberg.
          2.   At all material times, Defendant Denis Hoffman
("Hoffman") was and is an individual residing in the County of
Los Angeles, State of California.
          3.   Plaintiffs do not know the true names and
capacities of those defendants sued herein as Does 1 through 10,
inclusive, and therefore sues these defendants by such
fictitious names.  Plaintiffs will amend this complaint to
allege their true names and capacities when ascertained.
Plaintiffs are informed and believed and thereon allege that
each of Defendants Does 1 through 10, inclusive, is in some
manner legally responsible for the wrongful conduct described
herein or is in some way involved with or related to the actual
controversy that is the subject of this request for declaratory
relief.
          4.   This lawsuit is filed to obtain judicial
assistance to put an end to Hoffman's exploitive efforts to
parlay $10,000 in financial assistance given to Spielberg more
than 27 years ago into a $33 million claim to the fruits of
Spielberg's distinguished career.
          5.   Spielberg is a director and producer of motion
pictures.
          6.   In 1968, Hoffman provided financing of
approximately $10,000 for the production of a 20-minute short
subject film written by Spielberg called "Amblin'".  At the
time, Hoffman had no experience in producing, writing or
developing projects for motion pictures.  Hoffman requested, and
Spielberg agreed, that the music of a band then being managed by
Hoffman be used in the "Amblin'" film, and Spielberg used the
music of Hoffman's band in the film.
          7.   In exchange for the financing provided by
Hoffman, Hoffman exacted from Spielberg the young filmmaker's
agreement to (a) direct "Amblin'" for no compensation whatsoever
and (b) be bound for ten years to direct any script selected by
Hoffman if such a script was brought to Spielberg by Hoffman.
As compensation for this second film, Spielberg was to receive
the payment of $25,000 plus 5% of the profits after expenses
(the "1968 Amblin Contract").  A true and correct copy of the
1968 Amblin Contract is attached hereto as Exhibit A.
          8.   At no time did Hoffman ever bring any script to
Spielberg nor did Hoffman ever produce any other motion picture.
          9.   In 1975, Hoffman told Spielberg that he wanted
Spielberg to buy out Spielberg's remaining obligations under the
1968 Amblin Contract.  Hoffman said that he would like to recoup
his original outlay on the "Amblin'" film plus receive a profit.
Hoffman requested $30,000 for which he agreed to transfer to
Spielberg all rights to the "Amblin'" film and release Spielberg
of all obligations.  Because Hoffman had not brought a script to
Spielberg for Spielberg to direct, Spielberg offered to try to
obtain a producer's position for Hoffman on one of Spielberg's
next films.  Hoffman declined that offer and responded that he
did not want and was not equipped to be a producer and that he
wanted the $30,000 instead.
          10.  The respective attorneys for Hoffman and
Spielberg negotiated a written buy-out agreement whereby
Spielberg purchased the "Amblin'" film and all rights thereto
from Hoffman for the $30,000 requested by Hoffman in lieu of the
performance set forth in the 1968 Amblin Contract ("the 1977
Buy-Out Agreement").  A true and correct copy of the 1977 Buy-
Out Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit B.
          11.  Spielberg timely performed all of his obligations
under the 1977 Buy-Out Agreement, including the payment to
Hoffman of $30,000.
          12.  Over the years, Spielberg continued to express
his appreciation for Hoffman's efforts in financing the
"Amblin'" film by assisting Hoffman or Hoffman's business.  For
example, Spielberg caused Hoffman and Hoffman's titles studio,
Cinefx, to be hired to do titles work on one or more motion
pictures produced or directed by Spielberg.
          13.  In late 1985, more than seven years after the
1977 Buy-Out Agreement, Hoffman came to Spielberg once again 
to
ask Spielberg to provide Hoffman with financial help in starting
a gourmet donut business.  In recognition and appreciation of
Hoffman's 1968 financial assistance on the "Amblin'" film,
Spielberg provided the requested financial assistance to Hoffman
for his donut business.
          14.  Accordingly, Spielberg, through his wholly owned
corporation, Heights, (a) invested $15,000 in a limited
partnership called Designer Donuts ("Designer Donuts") in
exchange for a 20% interest in Designer Donuts as a limited
partner and (b) provided more than $60,000 in additional
financial backing to Hoffman's Designer Donuts business.
          15.  At all material times, Hoffman was and is the
general partner of Designer Donuts, with its principal place of
business at 7042 Pacific View Drive, Los Angeles, California.
          16.  As the general partner of Designer Donuts,
Hoffman owed fiduciary duties to Heights to act in the best
interests of Designer Donuts and not for his own self-interest
or to the detriment of Heights as a limited partner.
          17.  Hoffman breached his fiduciary duties to Heights
by, among other things, (a) failing to cause Designer Donuts to
make any distributions to Heights on account of its limited
partner interest in the more than nine years that Designer
Donuts has been in operation, notwithstanding recent
representations by Hoffman's representatives that the business
of Designer Donuts has been "very good," (b) causing Designer
Donuts to fail to pay Heights various loan and equipment lease
payments that Designer Donuts was contractually obligated to pay
Heights, without any cause therefor, and (c) failing to provide
Heights with regular and adequate information or reports
concerning the business affairs, financial prospects, or
financial performance of Designer Donuts.
          18.  As a direct and proximate result, Heights has
been damaged in an amount not yet ascertained, but which Heights
is informed and believes and thereon alleges is in excess of the
jurisdictional minimum of this Court.  Heights will seek leave
of this Court to amend this complaint when the true nature and
amount of its damages has been ascertained.

                     SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
              (By Spielberg For Declaratory Relief)

          19.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by this
reference paragraphs 1 through 11, above.
          20.  In or about May 1995, nearly twenty years after
the consummation of the 1977 Buy-Out Agreement and with
Spielberg's reputation as a filmmaker well established, Hoffman
surfaced once again and claimed, for the first time, that the
1977 Buy-Out Agreement was voidable and that Spielberg was still
obligated to direct a picture for Hoffman pursuant to the 1968
Amblin Contract or to pay damages for the alleged breach
thereof.  Hoffman demanded tens of millions of dollars from
Spielberg based on specious claims that the 1977 Buy-Out
Agreement had been procured by Spielberg through fraud.
Spielberg refused to yield to these baseless claims and prefers
that they be litigated in a court of law.
          21.  An actual controversy now exists between
Spielberg and Hoffman.  Spielberg contends that the 1977 Buy-Out
Agreement is valid and has been fully performed by Spielberg,
and that Spielberg does not owe any obligations or monies of any
kind whatsoever to Hoffman with respect to the 1977 Buy-Out
Agreement or the 1968 Amblin Contract.  Hoffman contends
otherwise.
          22.  Spielberg desires a judicial determination of his
and Hoffman's respective rights and duties with respect to the
1977 Buy-Out Agreement.  In particular, Spielberg desires a
declaration that the 1977 Buy-Out Agreement is valid and has
been fully performed by Spielberg, and that Spielberg does not
owe any obligations or monies of any kind whatsoever to Hoffman
with respect to the 1977 Buy-Out Agreement or the 1968 Amblin
Contract.
          23.  The requested declaratory relief is necessary and
appropriate at this time to enable Spielberg to establish that
he has no further obligations to Hoffman with respect to the
1977 Buy-Out Agreement or the 1968 Amblin Contract.

          WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for judgment against
Defendants as follows:
          1.   On the First Cause of Action, for damages
according to proof;
          2.   On the Second Cause of Action, for a declaration
by this Court that the 1977 Buy-Out Agreement is valid and has
been fully performed by Spielberg, and that Spielberg does not
owe any obligations or monies of any kind whatsoever to Hoffman
with respect to the 1977 Buy-Out Agreement or the 1968 Amblin
Contract; and
          3.   For costs of suit and for general relief.

<P>Dallas Cowboy's owner Jerry Jones calls the NFL's licensing organization a "price fixing cartel" in this Nov. 6, 1995 complaint. In 1993 and 1994, merchandise with his team's logo generated more than 20% of the revenue of all licensed NFL merchandise. He complains that it is unfair for the Cowboys to share this revenue equally with other teams.</P>

JURY TRIAL DEMANDED 
 
VERIFIED COMPLAINT 
FOR DAMAGES AND 
INJUNCTIVE AND 
DECLARATORY RELIEF 
95 Civ. __________ 
 
 
          Plaintiffs Dallas Cowboys Football Club, Ltd., 
Texas Stadium Corporation, Pro Silver Star, Ltd., JWJ 
Corporation, and Jerral W. Jones, by and through their 
attorneys, allege upon knowledge as to their own acts and 
otherwise upon information and belief, as follows: 
 
Preliminary Statement 
 
1.    Abuses by trusts like the Standard Oil Trust were 
among the driving forces behind enactment of the Sherman 
Antitrust Act in 1890.  Yet in 1982, the National Football 
League created the aptly-named  NFL Trust  to control the 
licensing of the marks of the NFL's member clubs.  The NFL 
Trust is a classic price-fixing cartel that has eliminated 
free competition among NFL clubs.  The cartel has harmed 
consumers, forced new NFL owners (such as plaintiffs) to 
cede control over licensing to the Trust, harassed 
plaintiffs for opposing the cartel, and tolerated 
mismanagement by its exclusive licensee, NFL Properties. 
Plaintiffs ask the Court to dismantle the NFL Trust and 
replace it with free market competition. 
 
2.   Plaintiffs are ready, willing, and able to compete 
vigorously with others in a free marketplace.  Breaking up 
the illegal cartel will permit plaintiffs and other member 
clubs to engage in spirited competition with one another 
(and with the NFL) in the licensing of professional football 
marks.  Ending the cartel will also benefit consumers by 
making the licensing process more responsive to consumer 
demand. 
 
3.   The NFL defendants have tried to expand the cartel's 
reach even beyond the broad rights granted to it by 
contract.  In the 1982 agreements setting up the cartel, 
each member club retained for itself, for example, the 
independent right to choose what apparel and marks its 
coaches, owners, and players would wear during football 
games.  The NFL defendants have nevertheless claimed for 
themselves the purported right to dictate what marks may and 
may not appear on the clothing worn by club personnel during 
games.  Plaintiffs ask the Court to issue a declaration 
correcting the NFL defendants  false claims on this critical 
issue. 
 
4.   Plaintiffs have suffered substantial monetary losses as 
a result of defendants  unlawful conduct.  Most obviously, 
the NFL cartel has prevented the Dallas Cowboys from 
independent commercial use of its marks during many years 
when those marks have been of substantial value.  The NFL 
defendants have caused plaintiffs further losses by falsely 
claiming (and selling to others) the right to determine what 
apparel member club personnel will wear during football 
games and by harassing plaintiffs in their routine business 
operations.  These losses have been compounded by the NFL 
defendants  waste of the income generated by the cartel 
through bloated administrative expenditures.  Plaintiffs 
seek $200 million in actual damages, trebled under the 
federal antitrust laws, in addition to an amount to be 
determined at trial for the NFL defendants  breaches of 
contract and common law duties.  Because the NFL defendants 
misconduct is egregious, deliberate, and malicious, 
plaintiffs further seek $150 million in punitive damages for 
violations of the NFL defendants  common law duties. 
 
Nature of the Action 
 
5.   Plaintiffs bring this action for compensatory, treble, 
and punitive damages, and for injunctive and declaratory 
relief, based on violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the 
Sherman Antitrust Act, as well as for breach of contract, 
breach of fiduciary duty, violation of common law due 
process, tortious interference with prospective economic 
advantage, and unjust enrichment.  Plaintiffs also bring 
derivative claims, on behalf of the NFL Trust and NFL 
Properties, for breaches of contract, for breach of 
fiduciary duty, and for negligence, waste, and 
mismanagement.  Finally, plaintiffs seek a declaratory 
judgment of non-infringement under the Lanham Act and other 
applicable laws with regard to matters challenged by 
defendant NFL Properties in litigation now pending in this 
Court. 
 
Jurisdiction and Venue 
 
6.   This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of 
this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sections 1331 (federal 
question), 1337 (commerce and antitrust regulations), 1338 
(trademark and related cases), and 1367 (supplemental 
jurisdiction).  Plaintiffs  federal claims arise under 
Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. 
Sections 1 and 2, and under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. 
Sections 1051 et seq., and are instituted pursuant to 
Sections 4, 12, and 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 
Sections 15, 22, and 26, and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 
28 U.S.C. Section 2201. 
 
7.    Venue in this District is proper under 28 U.S.C. 
Section 1391(b)(2) and (3) and 15 U.S.C. Sections 15 and 22.

Relevant Markets 
 
25.  For purposes of plaintiffs  antitrust claims, the 
relevant product markets include (a) the market for rights 
to use the marks of major league professional football clubs 
and otherwise to affiliate with major league professional 
football for purposes of advertising and promoting goods and 
services ( professional football sponsorship market ) and 
(b) the market for rights to use the marks of major league 
professional football clubs on apparel and other goods ( 
professional football merchandise market ). 
 
26.  The professional football sponsorship market involves 
the sale of rights to affiliate a company or product with 
professional football to promote the company or product. The 
market includes, for example, the sale of corporate 
sponsorships for individual professional football clubs and 
for the NFL; the sale of the right to use the marks of 
professional football clubs and the NFL in advertisements 
and promotions; and the sale of rights to have coaches, 
players, and  other club personnel wear particular apparel 
and logos during games ( sideline rights ).  At competitive 
prices, rights of this type have no close substitutes and 
are not reasonably interchangeable in use with any other 
products or rights, and the prices of rights of this type 
are not highly elastic with respect to prices of other 
products or rights. 
 
27.  The professional football merchandise market involves 
the sale of rights  to use the marks of professional 
football clubs or the NFL on apparel and other goods.  The 
market includes, for example, the sale of the right to use 
Dallas Cowboys or Chicago Bears logos, or the NFL Shield, on 
T-shirts, football jerseys, toys, home products, and 
sporting goods.  At competitive prices, rights of this type 
have no close substitutes and are not reasonably 
interchangeable in use with any other products or rights, 
and the prices of rights of this type are not highly elastic 
with respect to prices of other products or rights. 
 
28.  The relevant geographic market for assessing 
competition in the professional football sponsorship market 
and the professional football merchandise market is the 
United States.  Defendants have market power in the 
professional football sponsorship market and market power 
and monopoly power in the professional football merchandise 
market.  On information and belief, there are also local and 
regional submarkets of both the professional football 
sponsorship market and the professional football merchandise 
market. 
 
The NFL's Control over Major League Professional Football 
 
29.  Defendants  market power in the relevant product 
markets is derived in whole or in part from the NFL's 
position as the only significant provider of major league 
professional football in the United States.  Since the 
National Football League and the American Football League 
merged in 1966, all efforts to establish a football league 
to compete with the NFL have failed. 
 
30.  There are substantial barriers to entry into 
professional football and thus to entry into the 
professional football sponsorship market and professional 
football merchandise market.  As a result, the NFL and its 
member clubs are essentially the only sources of 
professional football marks in the United States. 
 
Interstate Commerce 
 
31.  The anticompetitive conduct alleged herein has taken 
place in interstate commerce and has restrained trade and 
commerce among the States.  Among other things, the products 
in the professional football sponsorship market and the 
professional football merchandise market are sold and/or 
licensed in interstate commerce.  Defendants  conduct has 
restrained trade and commerce among the States in these 
markets. 
 
DEFENDANTS UNLAWFUL CONDUCT 
 
A.   Defendants Creation of the Licensing Cartel 
 
32.  In or about 1982, the member clubs of the NFL formally 
established a cartel to control the licensing of the marks 
of all NFL clubs ( Club Marks ), as well as league-wide 
marks ( NFL Marks ), such as the NFL Shield and the phrase 
Super  Bowl.   The initial vehicle for establishment of the 
cartel was a Trust Agreement, entered into by the owners of 
all but two of the NFL member clubs, which created the NFL 
Trust.  In that Agreement, the clubs promised not to compete 
with one another, the NFL, or the newly created cartel in 
the commercial exploitation of their marks (subject to 
limited exceptions).     
 
33.  Pursuant to the same scheme, the NFL Trust 
simultaneously granted an exclusive license (as part of the 
License Agreement ) to defendant NFL Properties to 
administer the cartel.  The License Agreement requires NFL 
Properties to, among other things, use its best efforts to 
utilize and develop the Club Marks for the benefit of the 
Trust and its member club beneficiaries, which were intended 
third  party beneficiaries of the License Agreement.  Two 
member clubs (the Miami Dolphins and the Oakland Raiders) 
chose not to be parties to the Trust Agreement, but have 
licensed  their marks directly to NFL Properties. 
 
34.   On information and belief, in or about 1993, 
defendants Tagliabue and Austrian assumed effective control 
of NFL Properties. 
 
35.  Absent judicial relief, the cartel will continue to 
control the marketing of all Club Marks and NFL Marks, 
precluding (with only limited exceptions) competition among 
the clubs, and between the clubs and the NFL, in the 
licensing of professional football marks until at least 
March 31, 2004. 
 
36.  Pursuant to the Trust and License Agreements, NFL 
Properties pays the NFL Trust the proceeds from NFL 
Properties agreements with sponsors and licensees, after 
subtracting NFL Properties  fees and expenses.  The 
Trustees, in turn, have used a substantial portion of the 
net proceeds received from NFL Properties to pay expenses of 
the NFL. 
 
37.  After these and other deductions, the Trust distributes 
to each beneficiary/club an equal share of the net profits, 
regardless of the individual value of that club's marks, the 
club's contribution (if any) to the value of its marks, the 
club's efforts (if any) to promote itself and its marks, and 
the club's investment (if any) in creating a positive 
association with its marks. 
 
38.  The NFL, NFL Trust, and NFL Properties provide 
virtually no information to members, beneficiaries, 
shareholders, or  directors about those entities  operations 
and finances. Nevertheless, the little information these 
entities do provide shows that the amounts spent on 
administrative expenses are, to all appearances, 
extraordinarily and wastefully high. 
 
39.  In fiscal year 1994, for example, NFL Properties spent 
64% of its gross revenues for direct costs and 
administrative expenses.  Only 36% of NFL Properties  gross 
revenues was actually paid to the Trust as net proceeds.  Of 
that money, a substantial percentage was paid to the NFL, a 
small amount was contributed to charity, and  only a small 
portion was distributed to the clubs.  On information and 
belief, from January 1989 to the fall of 1994, no cash 
payments  at all were made by the Trust to the beneficiary 
clubs. 
 
40.  The marks of the member clubs are not of equal, or even 
comparable, value.  The marks of a relative handful of clubs 
generally account for the bulk of the revenues in any given 
year. On information and belief, for example, during 1993 
and 1994 more than 20% of the revenue generated by NFL 
Properties from licensed product sales was generated solely 
by products bearing Cowboys marks.  Despite this substantial 
contribution, however, the Cowboys Partnership is entitled 
to only one-thirtieth of the distributed profits of NFL 
Properties.  In contrast, as of June 1995, the combined 
sales of licenses to the marks of 20 of the 30 member clubs 
generated, according to published reports, only about 30% of 
the revenue of NFL Properties (or 1.5% each).  
 
41.  Because of the cartel and the substantial expenses it 
deducts at each stage, each club receives only about a penny 
or less for every additional dollar of revenue generated by 
the licensing of that club's marks.  As a result, the cartel 
deprives individual clubs of meaningful incentives to 
promote the sale of  their own team's marks.  
 
42.  In the absence of the cartel established by the Trust 
Agreement and License Agreement, the NFL member clubs would 
compete with one another, and with the NFL, in the 
professional football sponsorship market and the 
professional football merchandise market, leading to 
competitive pricing and increased output. 
 
B.   The Absence of Procompetitive Business Justification 
 
43.  In some respects, it is important and desirable for the 
members of a sports league, such as the NFL, to cooperate 
with one another.  For example, it is necessary and 
reasonable that member clubs agree on a common schedule, on 
rules of play, and on enforcement of those rules. 
 
44.  In other respects, however, concerted conduct 
constitutes an unreasonable restraint on trade and stifles 
desirable economic incentives.  Indeed, in other 
professional sports, individual clubs conduct licensing of 
club marks independently to a substantial degree. 
Independent licensing by each team increases competition and 
provides incentives to engage in spirited marketing and 
promotional efforts and greater investment in the marks. 
The establishment and maintenance of the NFL licensing 
cartel has needlessly inhibited these efforts in the markets 
at issue here. 
 
45.  In litigation recently commenced against some of the 
plaintiffs in the Southern District of New York, NFL 
Properties has recited various supposed benefits of the 
cartel. These supposed benefits are pretextual, or can 
reasonably be achieved without restraining competition or in 
a less restrictive manner, and do not reasonably justify the 
anticompetitive joint conduct of the cartel.  The cartel is 
not reasonably necessary to serve any legitimate, 
procompetitive goal. 
 
46.  For example, the cartel is not reasonably necessary to 
maintain competitive balance in team performance among the 
member clubs.  First, the cartel regulates only a relatively 
small source of club revenue.  The overwhelming bulk of club 
revenue derives from equally-shared television rights fees, 
which are not controlled by the NFL licensing cartel and are 
not challenged in this lawsuit.  Second, the equal sharing 
of profits does not in fact lead to competitive balance. 
Indeed, the sharing of profits can create just the opposite 
effect, leaving poor-performing teams with no incentive to 
spend more on players or to strive to improve.  According to 
a published study, for example, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers won 
fewer games than any other team in the NFL between 1980 and 
1990, but enjoyed the highest level of profitability of any 
team during that same period.  Third, the purported interest 
in achieving competitive balance among member clubs can 
readily be achieved in a much less restrictive and 
anticompetitive manner, through devices such as player 
drafts favoring less successful teams, a salary cap, and the 
like. 
 
47.  The cartel hinders efficiency, rather than enhances it, 
by creating an incentive for free-riding.  The equal 
distribution of profits generated from the licensing of Club 
Marks, regardless of the value of any particular club's mark 
or the quantity of sales, diminishes the incentives for 
individual clubs to promote their marks competitively and to 
invest in their marks.  Individual club owners know that 
they will share equally in the profits of the cartel, 
regardless of their own contribution.  Similarly, each club 
owner knows that it will receive only about a penny or less 
for every additional dollar of revenue it generates through 
the promotion of its marks.  The cartel thus leaves 
individual club owners with little reason to invest in such 
promotion. 
 
48.  The  cartel also retards efficiency by  limiting the 
incentive and opportunity for individual clubs to enhance 
the value of their marks by providing complementary products 
and services, such as public appearances by club personnel, 
to Club Mark licensees. 
 
49.  The cartel's exclusive control over the marks of all 
NFL Clubs, and the bundling of those marks as a single 
package, does not produce a superior product.  Many 
licensees would prefer to buy the right to use the marks of 
only a few member clubs and have no interest in purchasing 
the marks of other clubs.  As the NFL's director of 
corporate communications, Chris Widmaier, has publicly 
admitted,  sponsors have told us that they d be happy if NFL 
Properties went away  because the cartel limits their 
ability to choose what marks to purchase and forces them to 
increase their overall spending. 
 
C.   Defendants  Enforcement of the Cartel 
 
(1)  Imposition of Cartel Membership on New Owners and New 
Clubs   
 
50.  The NFL requires the approval of no fewer than 
three-fourths of its member clubs before allowing any person 
to purchase an existing NFL club.  Similarly, a new club may 
become a member of the NFL only if three-fourths of the 
member clubs approve. 
 
51.  The NFL and its member clubs also maintain the right to 
cancel an owner's franchise or otherwise punish an owner of 
a club for failing to abide by the NFL Constitution and 
Bylaws or for engaging in conduct deemed  detrimental to the 
welfare of the League.   A decision by the NFL to cancel or 
terminate a franchise is, under Section 8.13(B) of the NFL's 
Constitution and Bylaws, final, conclusive, and 
unappealable. 
 
52.  Since 1982, any person wishing to acquire a controlling 
interest in an existing or new NFL club, including 
plaintiffs Jones and JWJ Corporation, have been required to 
assent to the cartel's control over licensing of the club's 
marks, subject to certain rights reserved by the club.  This 
power to preclude any person from acquiring an NFL team 
without first consenting to the cartel arrangement provides 
the NFL and its member clubs with a potent tool to restrain 
competition in the professional football sponsorship market 
and the professional football merchandise market. 
 
53.  Plaintiffs JWJ Corporation and Jones did not own, 
manage or control the Cowboys franchise in 1982, when the 
cartel was created.  Texas Stadium Corporation, JWJ 
Corporation, Jones, and Pro Silver Star are not, and have 
never been, parties to the Trust Agreement or License 
Agreement. 
 
(2)  Punishment and Retaliation for Opposition to the Cartel 
 
54.  Although plaintiffs have at all times complied with 
their contractual and other legal obligations, plaintiffs 
have objected to the anticompetitive conduct of the cartel 
and have publicly and privately advocated abolishing or 
limiting the cartel.  Plaintiffs  expression of these views 
has prompted repeated and continuing efforts by the NFL 
Defendants to punish and retaliate against plaintiffs.  The 
NFL and NFL Properties have, in a blatantly discriminatory 
fashion, manipulated their internal administrative processes 
to reward clubs that have toed the cartel's line, and to 
punish plaintiffs for advocating reform.  These defendants 
acts of wrongful discrimination against plaintiff Cowboys 
Partnership and Jones include, but are not limited to, the 
following: 
 
55.  In February 1995, the President of the NFL, defendant 
Neil Austrian, wrote to plaintiffs about a proposed deal 
between Pro Silver Star and a distributor of Snapple fruit 
juice beverages.  Mr. Austrian's letter made clear that the 
NFL intended to apply a different and harsher set of rules 
to plaintiffs than to other NFL member clubs.  Mr. Austrian 
first candidly acknowledged that  [t]here is no legal 
prohibition on owners, coaches or players endorsing 
products, even products that compete with those of our 
sponsors.   While admitting the lack of any such legal 
prohibition, however, Mr. Austrian asserted that  an owner 
with your profile  should not engage in such a transaction, 
and threatened to  take action  if plaintiffs proceeded with 
the transaction.  (Emphasis  added.)  On this blatantly and 
facially discriminatory basis, the NFL harassed plaintiffs 
and sought to prevent them from entering into a lawful 
transaction with the Snapple distributor. 
 
56.  In 1994, the NFL employed numerous roadblocks to impede 
the Cowboys  plans to modify the uniforms worn by Cowboys 
players.  The NFL's objections were based on an NFL rule 
that the Cowboys Partnership had complied with and that the 
NFL had, in any event, readily waived for other NFL clubs. 
The NFL ultimately forced plaintiffs to agree to purchase 
from NFL Properties  licensees any unsold merchandise using 
the previous uniform design, a requirement that, on 
information and belief, the NFL had never before imposed on 
any club. 
 
57.  During 1993 and 1994, the NFL and NFL Properties 
repeatedly harassed plaintiffs about transactions between 
plaintiff Pro Silver Star and Apex One, an apparel 
manufacturer licensed by NFL Properties.  In these 
transactions, plaintiffs   lawfully agreed,  among other 
things, to have Cowboys personnel wear uniforms and other 
apparel manufactured by Apex in return for a sponsorship 
payment.  On  information and belief, these defendants 
attempted to force  NFL Properties  Pro Line apparel 
licensees, including Apex One, to agree not to enter into 
contracts similar to that between Pro Silver Star and Apex. 
 
58.  On information and belief, NFL Properties has cemented 
allegiance to the cartel by arbitrarily permitting favored 
clubs to enter into sponsorship agreements for product 
categories that are covered by NFL Properties' national 
sponsorship agreements, allowing these clubs to retain for 
themselves the proceeds of such agreements.  At the same 
time, NFL Properties has discriminated against plaintiffs by 
repeatedly denying them permission to enter into similar 
agreements. 
 
59.  In 1994, the NFL advocated adoption of an arbitrary and 
unfair revenue  sharing system that would have required the 
Cowboys Partnership  to pay far more than any other  club, 
and that, on information and belief, would have resulted in 
a net shifting of funds to clubs in some of the largest 
markets in the nation. 
 
60.  In 1995, the NFL Defendants forced plaintiffs to  cover 
certain commercial signage in Texas Stadium, citing an NFL 
rule about  low  stadium signage.   When the NFL defendants 
discovered that stadiums other than Texas Stadium refused to 
comply with this  rule, however, the NFL Defendants stopped 
enforcing it. 
 
61.  The NFL has threatened to punish plaintiffs by limiting 
opportunities for the Cowboys to play in high-profile, 
nationally telecast games, such as the Thanksgiving Day game 
or Monday Night Football games. 
 
62.  In the fall of 1995, the NFL Defendants caused the NFL 
Management Council to apply the salary cap provisions of the 
Collective Bargaining Agreement to the Cowboys  contract 
with Deion Sanders in a restrictive manner that had never 
before been applied to any other player with a similar 
contract. 
 
63.  Defendant NFL Properties has harassed plaintiffs about 
lawful licensing transactions that Jones, Pro Silver Star, 
and Texas Stadium Corporation have entered into with Dr 
Pepper Bottling Company of Texas ( Dr Pepper ), Pepsico ( 
Pepsi ), Nike, Inc. ( Nike ) and American Express Travel 
Related Services Company, Inc. ( American Express ). 
Defendants  campaign of harassment and intimidation has 
culminated in NFL Properties filing suit in the United 
States District Court for the Southern District of New York 
(Civil Action 95-7951) against the Cowboys Partnership, 
Jones, and Texas Stadium Corporation in September 1995 ( the 
NFL Properties lawsuit ).  In this meritless lawsuit, NFL 
Properties seeks damages of $500 million.  The lawsuit is 
calculated to intimidate plaintiffs and to silence their 
advocacy of abolition or limitation of the cartel. 
 
64.  The NFL Properties lawsuit is objectively baseless in 
that no reasonable person could realistically expect success 
on the merits.  The critical factual allegations of the 
lawsuit -- such as allegations that plaintiffs licensed Dr 
Pepper, Pepsi, or American Express to use Club Marks or NFL 
Marks -- are demonstrably false.  Even after the plaintiffs 
conclusively demonstrated to NFL Properties the falsity of 
the central allegations in the lawsuit, NFL Properties has 
continued to pursue the action. 
 
65.  The baselessness of the NFL Properties lawsuit is also 
demonstrated by the fact that Foxboro Stadium, in which the 
New England Patriots play, entered into a transaction with 
Pepsi that is essentially identical to the Pepsi/Texas 
Stadium transaction attacked in the NFL Properties lawsuit. 
Yet far from filing a $500 million lawsuit against the New 
England Patriots, the NFL has recognized the lawfulness of 
the Pepsi/Foxboro Stadium transaction and taken no steps to 
oppose it. 
 
66.  The NFL Properties lawsuit was not brought to obtain a 
judgment, but to interfere with the business relationships 
of plaintiffs, to retaliate against plaintiffs for their 
opposition to the cartel, and to chill others from joining 
in that opposition.  In discussing the Texas Stadium 
contract with Pepsi, for example, defendant Tagliabue stated 
that  [t]he key thing is not so much the pouring rights but 
some of [Jones ] rhetoric attacking NFL Properties. 
 
D.   The Cartel's Efforts to Expand its Control 
 
67.  The Trust Agreement and License Agreement together 
(unlawfully) grant NFL Properties most rights to exploit 
Club Marks and NFL Marks commercially.  The rights granted 
by the clubs to the cartel, are, however, limited in certain 
respects. The NFL Defendants have nevertheless sought to 
exercise rights expressly reserved to the clubs in the 
Agreements, in order to protect and expand the cartel and in 
an effort to monopolize the professional football 
sponsorship market and the professional football merchandise 
market. 
 
68.  Under the Trust Agreement and the License Agreement, 
each club retained the right to determine what apparel its 
players, coaches, and other club personnel will wear during 
football games, including apparel bearing Club Marks or 
third party marks.  The Trust Agreement expressly reserved 
to each club (including  the Cowboys Partnership)   the 
exclusive right to use Club Marks in connection with the 
presentation of football exhibitions.   (Emphasis added.) 
At the time the Agreements were entered into in 1982, as 
now, by far the most significant aspect of the  presentation 
of football exhibitions  was through television.  The clubs, 
including the Dallas Cowboys, thus explicitly retained the 
exclusive right to control the  use of Club Marks  during 
presentation of football exhibitions  on television or 
otherwise.  In addition, the Trust and License Agreements 
did not grant the NFL Trust or NFL Properties any right 
whatsoever to control what third party marks may appear on 
apparel worn by club personnel (or guests of clubs) during 
football exhibitions.  Nonetheless, the NFL Defendants have 
unlawfully attempted to expand the cartel by purporting to 
exercise control over the apparel worn by club personnel and 
others during  NFL games. 
 
69.  In a May 1995 letter, defendant NFL, through defendant 
Tagliabue, conceded that  there [is] no NFL rule . . . 
dealing with the wearing of NFL Properties-licensed apparel 
by coaches on team sidelines during games,  and acknowledged 
that the only possible legal basis for NFL Properties 
claimed right to control the sidelines is  the member clubs 
grant of rights to NFL Properties and Properties  role in 
managing the . . . licensing program.   Since the  member 
clubs  grant of rights to NFL Properties  (in the Trust 
Agreement) does not include any sideline rights, this letter 
is an admission that the clubs, and not NFL Properties, are 
entitled to determine what apparel their personnel will wear 
during games. 
 
70.   The NFL has nevertheless repeatedly used its power 
over the clubs in an unlawful effort to coerce compliance 
with the cartel's efforts to dictate what apparel club 
personnel wear during games.  For example, the NFL has 
wrongfully refused to approve the contracts between the 
Cowboys Partnership and its coaches unless the contracts 
include a clause granting NFL Properties control over the 
apparel worn by the coaches -- a right that in fact belongs 
to each club.  Because the NFL has abused its power in this 
way, the Cowboys Partnership has, since February 1995, been 
unable to obtain NFL approval (which is required by the NFL 
Constitution and Bylaws) for the contracts with its head 
coaches and assistant coaches.  Plaintiffs have thus been 
forced to take the risk that some of its most important 
assets -- such as the Cowboys  contract with its head coach 
-- could be held unenforceable by a court. 
 
71.  The NFL and NFL Properties, acting jointly, wrongfully 
coerced plaintiffs to convey to NFL  Properties a total of 
$1 million belonging  to plaintiffs from contracts with Apex 
One relating to sideline rights. 
 
72.  NFL Properties has reportedly entered  into an 
agreement with Nike in which NFL Properties grants to Nike 
the right to provide Cowboys personnel  with Nike-branded 
apparel  to  be worn during Cowboys games.  On information 
and belief, Nike agreed to pay NFL Properties many millions 
of dollars for the right to have Cowboys personnel wear such 
apparel.   It is plaintiffs, however, and not NFL 
Properties, that have the right to enter into that 
transaction with Nike.  Plaintiffs have lost many millions 
of dollars of revenues to which they are entitled as a 
result of NFL Properties  wrongful claim to these rights, 
and NFL Properties has unlawfully benefitted by the same 
amount. 
 
E.   Anticompetitive Effects of the Cartel and Injury to 
Plaintiffs 
 
73.  As a direct, actual, probable, and intended result of 
defendants  unlawful agreements and conduct, defendants have 
substantially lessened competition in the professional 
football sponsorship market and the professional football 
merchandise market.  Output is lower than it would otherwise 
be  and is unresponsive to consumer preferences.  But for 
the unlawful restrictions imposed by the cartel, plaintiffs, 
among others, would offer for sale many licensing 
opportunities not now available in the marketplace. 
 
74.  As the direct, actual, probable and intended result of 
defendants  unlawful agreements and conduct, plaintiffs and 
others have been denied the right to compete freely in the 
professional football sponsorship market and the 
professional football merchandise market.  Plaintiffs have 
been denied the right to profits to which they were, or 
should have been, entitled as the owner of the Cowboys marks 
and other property; have been denied the right to enter into 
economically efficient and beneficial business arrangements; 
and will continue to suffer injury through at least March 
2004, absent judicial relief. Plaintiffs have also suffered 
substantial injury from the NFL Defendants  repeated efforts 
to punish and harass plaintiffs for their opposition to the 
cartel; from the NFL Defendants  efforts  to expand the 
cartel by interfering with plaintiffs  legitimate business 
activities; and from the NFL Defendants  imposition  of 
significant costs on plaintiffs, including the costs of 
defending sham  litigation attacking lawful business 
activities. 
 
75.  As  the direct, actual, probable, and intended result 
of defendants  unlawful agreements and conduct, the cartel 
has unlawfully created and maintained a monopoly in the 
professional football merchandise market by denying 
individual member clubs the right freely to compete in the 
market. 
 
76.  The cartel has also diminished incentives to create 
innovative products in the professional football sponsorship 
market and the professional football merchandise market, to 
market products and to promote NFL member clubs nationally, 
and otherwise to compete vigorously in the professional 
football sponsorship market and the professional football 
merchandise market. 
 
77.  The Trust and License Agreements that are now in place, 
and defendants  continuing conduct,  present a significant 
threat of future injury to plaintiffs in particular and 
competition in general. 
 
F.  Mismanagement 
 
78.  In part because it does not face the rigors of 
competition, the NFL licensing cartel, like other cartels, 
has been run with little regard for efficiency.  As a 
result, contrary to their obligations under the Trust and 
License  Agreements and the common law,  the NFL Defendants 
have failed to exercise their best efforts to utilize the 
NFL Marks and the Club Marks for the benefit of the member 
clubs.  The Trustees of the NFL Trust, in addition, have, in 
violation of their fiduciary duties, been grossly negligent 
in failing to ensure that NFL Properties has managed  Trust 
assets appropriately. 
 
79.  As a result of these breaches of duty, NFL Properties 
and the NFL have incurred excessive overhead and expenses, 
far beyond what is reasonably necessary to accomplish their 
business purposes.  These excessive expenses directly reduce 
the licensing royalties available to be distributed to the 
Cowboys Partnership and other clubs. 
 
80.  The NFL Defendants  toleration of unjustifiable 
expenditures and incompetent practices in the management of 
the Trust assets has harmed plaintiffs by diminishing the 
revenues ultimately distributed to the clubs and the value 
of plaintiff Cowboys Partnership's investment in NFL 
Properties. 
 
81.  These practices have been largely concealed from 
plaintiffs because the NFL Defendants have failed to provide 
Cowboys Partnership, as an NFL member club and a beneficiary 
of the Trust, or Jones, as a shareholder and (from 1989 to 
June 1995) a director of NFL Properties, with material 
information about the operations and finances of the NFL, 
the NFL Trust, or NFL Properties.  For example, these 
plaintiffs have been provided with little or no information 
concerning (a) the operating, administrative, and overhead 
expenses of the NFL, NFL Properties, or the NFL Trust; (b) 
reports  prepared by outside counsel, auditors, and other 
consultants hired to investigate allegations of 
mismanagement, waste, and abuse at NFL Properties; and (c) 
reports by outside accountants about internal accounting 
controls. 
 
82.  Plaintiffs have been injured in their business and 
property by the NFL Defendants  failure to provide this 
information, in part because the lack of adequate and timely 
information available to directors, shareholders, and 
beneficiaries has contributed to the gross mismanagement of 
NFL Properties.    
 
G.    Discriminatory Treatment 
 
83.  The NFL Defendants are obligated, pursuant to the Trust 
and License Agreements, the NFL's Constitution and Bylaws, 
the Rules of the NFL, and the common law, to treat each 
member club, including plaintiffs  Cowboys Partnership, and 
each club owner, in  a fair, consistent, and equitable 
manner.  As described above, the NFL Defendants have 
repeatedly breached that duty by applying, interpreting and 
seeking to enforce provisions of those agreements in an 
arbitrary, inconsistent, and discriminatory manner against 
plaintiffs Cowboys Partnership and Jones. 
 
84.  The NFL Defendants have thus deliberately and 
repeatedly treated plaintiffs Jones and Cowboys Partnership 
in a manner different -- and far more harsh -- than NFL 
clubs that are in favor with the NFL bureaucracy.  This 
conduct is arbitrary, capricious, and motivated by malice 
towards plaintiffs, and is unlawful both under the governing 
contracts (such as the Trust Agreement) and the common law. 
 
85.  The NFL Defendants  tortious conduct and breaches of 
fiduciary duty have been intentional and deliberate, 
malicious, wanton, reckless and in deliberate disregard of 
the rights of others.  This misconduct has been egregious, 
has involved a high degree of moral culpability, moral 
turpitude and wanton dishonesty, and has been aimed at 
plaintiffs and at the public generally. 
 
86.  Defendants  misconduct is causing irreparable injury to 
plaintiffs, and unless enjoined, will continue to do so. 
Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law with respect to 
future misconduct by defendants. 
 
COUNT I 
 
(Violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act) 
 
Restraint of Trade in the Professional Football Sponsorship 
Market 
 
87.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1  through 86 
as though fully set forth herein. 
 
88.  By reason of the foregoing, since at least as early as 
October 1, 1982 and continuing through the present, 
defendants have acted in concert with the purpose, intent, 
and effect of unreasonably restraining trade and commerce in 
the professional football sponsorship market.  Defendants 
operate a horizontal cartel, through which the NFL member 
clubs have agreed not to compete with each other and thereby 
to fix prices and to reduce output below competitive levels 
in the professional football sponsorship market.  Through 
the Trust and License Agreements, the operation of the NFL, 
and defendants  conduct, defendants have, with only limited 
exceptions, precluded all competition for the licensing of 
Club and NFL Marks. 
 
89.  Defendants have also conspired to expand this cartel 
and further to restrain competition.  Their acts in 
furtherance of this plan include, for example, refusing to 
approve certain club contracts, harassing plaintiffs over 
other lawful business activities, and engaging in other 
wrongful acts set forth above to block plaintiffs from 
exercising their legal right to license and/or sell products 
not subject to the cartel's control, such as sideline 
rights. 
 
90.  The intentional and anticompetitive conduct by which 
defendants have unreasonably restrained output in the 
professional football sponsorship market is not reasonably 
necessary to further any legitimate, procompetitive goal of 
the NFL, NFL Properties, or the member clubs. 
 
91.  Defendants  anticompetitive conduct has directly and 
proximately caused injury and damage to plaintiffs  business 
and property, as set forth above.  Plaintiffs will continue 
to be so injured unless defendants are enjoined from 
continuing to engage in the foregoing violations of law. 
 
92.  The actual, probable, and intended effects of the 
foregoing acts and practices, and the continuing course of 
defendants  anticompetitive conduct, has caused injury to 
consumers and to competition in the professional football 
sponsorship market, as set forth above.

Restraint of Trade in the Professional Football Merchandise 
Market 
 
93.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1 through 92 
as though fully set forth herein. 
 
94.   By reason of the foregoing, since at least as early as 
October 1, 1982 and continuing through the present, 
defendants have acted in concert with the purpose, intent, 
and effect of unreasonably restraining trade and commerce. 
Defendants operate a horizontal cartel, through which the 
NFL member clubs have agreed not to compete with each other 
and thereby to fix prices and to reduce output below 
competitive levels in the professional football merchandise 
market.  Through the Trust and License Agreements, operation 
of the NFL, and defendants  conduct, defendants have, with 
only limited exceptions, precluded all competition for the 
licensing of the Club and NFL Marks. 
 
95.   The intentional and anticompetitive conduct by which 
defendants have restrained output in the professional 
football merchandise market is not reasonably necessary to 
the furtherance of any legitimate, procompetitive goal of 
the NFL, NFL Properties, or the member clubs. 
 
96.   Defendants  anticompetitive conduct has directly and 
proximately caused injury and damage to plaintiffs  business 
and property, as set forth above.  Plaintiffs will continue 
to be so injured unless defendants are enjoined from 
continuing to engage in the foregoing violations of law. 
 
97.  The actual, probable, and intended effects of the 
foregoing acts and practices, and the continuing course of 
defendants  anticompetitive conduct, has caused injury to 
consumers and to competition in the professional football 
merchandise market, as set forth above. 
 
COUNT III 
 
(Violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act) 
 
Attempt to Monopolize the Professional Football Sponsorship 
Market 
 
98.   Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1 through 97 
as though fully set forth herein. 
 
99.   Since at least as early as October 1, 1982 and 
continuing through the present, defendants have engaged in 
the conduct alleged herein with the specific intent to 
monopolize the professional football sponsorship market. 
Through their control of professional football, and through 
the Trust and License Agreements, defendants have been able 
to obtain, with only limited exceptions, exclusive control 
over all Club and NFL Marks.  These marks constitute the 
principal goods in the professional football sponsorship 
market.  Not content with this substantial control of that 
market, defendants have attempted to expand their control of 
the market, and to monopolize the professional football 
sponsorship market, by, for example, refusing to approve 
certain club contracts, harassing plaintiffs over lawful 
business activities, and engaging in other wrongful acts set 
forth above to block plaintiffs from exercising their legal 
rights to license and/or sell products not subject to the 
cartel's control, such as sideline rights. 
 
100.  Defendants  purpose and goal is to monopolize the 
professional football sponsorship market and to limit output 
in that market. 
 
101.  There is a dangerous probability that defendants will 
succeed in monopolizing the professional football 
sponsorship market.  Defendants already exercise almost 
exclusive control over Club and NFL Marks, which constitute 
the principal goods in the market.  Moreover, all product 
suppliers in the professional football sponsorship market 
necessarily do business either directly or indirectly with 
the NFL.  The NFL, in turn, is capable of using, and has 
used, its control over professional football to coerce and 
control product suppliers from freely competing with NFL 
Properties in the professional football sponsorship market. 
 
102.  Defendants  anticompetitive conduct has directly and 
proximately caused injury and damage to plaintiffs  business 
and property, as set forth above.  Plaintiffs will continue 
to be so injured unless defendants are enjoined from 
continuing to engage in the foregoing violations of law. 
 
103.  The actual, probable, and intended effects of the 
foregoing acts and practices, and the continuing course of 
defendants  anticompetitive conduct, has caused injury to 
consumers and to competition in the professional football 
sponsorship market, as set forth above. 
 
COUNT IV 
 
(Violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act) 
 
Conspiracy to Monopolize the Professional Football 
Sponsorship Market 
 
104.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1 through 
103 as though fully set forth herein. 
 
105.  Since at least as early as October 1, 1982 and 
continuing through the present, defendants have conspired 
and combined with one another to monopolize trade and 
commerce in the professional football sponsorship market. 
The substantial terms of the conspiracy were, among others, 
that members of the cartel would transfer to the NFL Trust 
(and then to NFL Properties) the right to license all Club 
Marks and NFL Marks; that, with only limited exceptions, 
members of the cartel would not compete in the licensing of 
Club Marks and NFL Marks; and that the NFL and its member 
clubs would not grant a franchise, or permit the transfer of 
an existing franchise, to any person or company unwilling to 
join the cartel.  Defendants have also conspired and 
combined with one another to intimidate and coerce the 
plaintiffs from competing in the professional football 
sponsorship market, such as through the lawful sale of 
sideline rights. 
 
106.  In furtherance of the combination and conspiracy, 
defendants committed the acts set forth herein, including, 
without limitation, agreeing (with only limited exceptions) 
to license Club Marks and NFL Marks exclusively through the 
NFL cartel, refusing to approve certain club contracts, 
harassing plaintiffs over other lawful business activities, 
and engaging in other wrongful acts set forth above to block 
plaintiffs from exercising their legal rights to license 
and/or sell products not controlled by the cartel, such as 
sideline rights. 
 
107.  Defendants specifically intended that the effect of 
their unlawful combination and conspiracy would be to 
achieve and maintain a monopoly in the professional football 
sponsorship market. 
 
108.  Defendants  anticompetitive conduct has directly and 
proximately caused injury and damage to plaintiffs  business 
and property, as set forth above.  Plaintiffs will continue 
to be so injured unless defendants are enjoined from 
continuing to engage in the foregoing violations of law. 
 
109.  The actual, probable, and intended effects of the 
foregoing acts and practices, and the continuing course of 
defendants  anticompetitive conduct, has caused injury to

addition, defendants have conspired and combined with one 
another to attempt to intimidate plaintiffs and to deter 
them from criticizing the professional football merchandise 
cartel. 
 
118.  In furtherance of the combination and conspiracy, 
defendants committed the acts set forth herein, including, 
without limitation, agreeing (with only limited exceptions) 
to license Club Marks and NFL Marks exclusively through the 
NFL cartel. 
 
119.  Defendants specifically intended that the effect of

123.  Since at least as early as October 1, 1982 and 
continuing through the present, defendants have engaged in

defendants intended would, and that did, acquire, maintain, 
and perpetuate the cartel's monopoly in the professional 
football merchandise market. 
 
124.  In furtherance of this violation, defendants have 
engaged on a continuing basis in the following exclusionary, 
anticompetitive, and monopolistic practices, among others: 
(a) defendants have used their control over professional 
football to exclude competitors from the professional 
football merchandise market; (b) defendants have sought to 
coerce and intimidate plaintiffs to prevent them from 
criticizing defendants  monopoly power in the professional 
football merchandise market; (c) the member clubs have 
conveyed to the NFL Trust and NFL Properties the exclusive 
rights (with only limited exceptions) to license the Club 
Marks; and (d) defendants have agreed not to compete with 
one another in the professional football merchandise market. 
 
 
125.  Defendants  anticompetitive conduct has directly and

COUNT VIII 
 
(Lanham Act and related laws) 
 
Declaration of Rights 
 
127.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1 through 
126 as though fully set forth herein. 
 
128.  The Trust Agreement and License Agreement do not 
purport to, and do not, grant the NFL Trust or NFL 
Properties any right to control licensing of the names or 
logos of the stadiums in which NFL teams play. 
 
129. The NFL Defendants have long recognized that stadiums 
in which NFL teams play are entitled to market themselves 
(and to license their own marks) for financial gain. The 
stadium in which the San Francisco 49ers play their home 
games, for example, which was formerly known as Candlestick 
Park, has recently been renamed  3Com Park  in return for a 
payment of money by 3Com Corporation, a computer technology 
firm.  The stadium in which the St. Louis Rams will soon 
play is named the Trans World Dome  in exchange for 
multi-million dollar payments to the Rams.  And the owners 
of the domed stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana in which the 
Indianapolis Colts play (formerly called the Hoosier Dome) 
have renamed it the  RCA Dome in return for a package of 
financial incentives provided by the manufacturer of RCA 
products, Thomas Consumer Electronics.  On information and 
belief, the NFL and NFL Properties have not challenged this 
highly publicized transaction even though RCA sells many 
products that compete directly with those of Sony 
Corporation, which has paid NFL Properties for the exclusive 
national rights to use Club Marks and NFL Marks in 
connection with consumer electronic products. 
 
130.  Stadiums have also entered into marketing agreements 
in which corporate sponsors have obtained the right to 
associate themselves in other ways with stadiums in which 
NFL teams play.  For example, the owners of Foxboro Stadium, 
where the New England Patriots play, entered into an 
agreement with Pepsi in August 1995 in which Pepsi gained 
the right to advertise itself (both inside and outside the 
stadium) as the  Official Cola of Foxboro Stadium.   The 
stadium is owned by Robert Kraft, who also owns the 
Patriots. 
 
131.  The NFL has not objected to any of these arrangements, 
and could not responsibly do so since the transactions do 
not involve licensing of any Club Marks or NFL Marks. 
 
132.  Texas Stadium Corporation, Pro Silver Star, and Jones 
have entered into transactions with Dr Pepper, Pepsi, Nike, 
and American Express in which Texas Stadium Corporation has 
licensed these sponsors to use the Stadium's own marks. 
These transactions do not involve licensing of the right to 
use any NFL Mark or Club Mark.  The transactions are 
consistent with the plaintiffs  purported obligations to the 
NFL cartel and are lawful. 
 
133.  Although the transactions with Dr Pepper, Pepsi, Nike, 
and American Express are lawful, defendant NFL Properties 
has filed a lawsuit against several of the plaintiffs 
demanding $500 million in damages.  The NFL Defendants 
discriminatory and improper motives are shown by the fact 
that they have taken no action against the essentially 
identical Pepsi/Foxboro Stadium deal, even though the press 
release announcing the Foxboro Stadium transaction twice 
refers to the stadium as the  home of the New England 
Patriots.   (Emphasis added.) 
 
134.  Defendants have no contractual or other right to 
control any licensing transaction that does not involve the 
use of an NFL Mark or Club Mark.  Plaintiffs  may therefore 
lawfully enter into transactions in which they license third 
parties to affiliate themselves with Texas Stadium.  Among 
other things, the transactions between plaintiffs and Pepsi, 
Dr Pepper, American Express, and Nike are entirely lawful. 
If (contrary to fact) defendants might have had any 
conceivable basis for objecting to such transactions, they 
have long since waived any such right, and are barred by 
estoppel and other equitable doctrines from enforcing any 
such right, in light of their long-standing approval of, or 
knowing acquiescence in, similar transactions entered into 
by others. 
 
135.  As discussed above, plaintiff Cowboys Partnership 
retained all rights to control the use of Cowboys marks in 
the exhibition of football games, including the right to 
control the apparel worn by Cowboys personnel on the 
sidelines.  Plaintiffs may therefore lawfully enter into 
transactions that relate to the apparel worn by Cowboys 
personnel on the sidelines, such as the contract between 
certain of the plaintiffs and Nike.  Plaintiffs, and not 
defendants, are also entitled to agree to wear the marks and 
logos of third parties, such as Nike, on the uniforms of 
Cowboys personnel. 
 
136.  Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to a declaration 
that the Pepsi, Dr Pepper, Nike, and American Express 
transactions are entirely lawful, and that they are entitled 
to enter into transactions that include, among other terms, 
(a) licensing third parties to affiliate themselves with 
Texas Stadium and (b) agreeing to wear particular apparel 
during football games, including apparel bearing the marks 
and logos of third parties.  There is a real and actual 
controversy about these matters.  Absent a declaration from 
the Court, the uncertainty as to plaintiffs  rights caused 
by defendants wrongful and continuing misconduct will 
continue, to the injury of plaintiffs. 
 
COUNT IX 
 
Breach of Trust and License Agreements 
 
(NFL Trust, Trustees, and NFL Properties) 
 
137.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1 through 
136 as though fully set forth herein. 
 
138.  The NFL Trust, its Trustees, and NFL Properties are 
obligated by the Trust and License Agreements to utilize and 
administer the Trust assets so as to avoid waste and 
incompetence in the management of the proceeds.  This 
obligation arises under the express terms of the Agreements, 
and under the implied covenants of good faith and fair 
dealing inherent in those  Agreements.  It was in 
consideration of this obligation, among others, that the 
clubs entered into the Trust and chose NFL Properties as the 
Trust's exclusive licensing agent. 
 
139.  Instead of maximizing distributions to the clubs 
(and/or to charity) from licensing the Club Marks, these 
defendants have wasted these valuable assets through the 
acts of mismanagement and waste described above.  These 
defendants  failure to manage these assets properly has 
caused great financial harm to plaintiff  Cowboys 
Partnership and its owners, plaintiffs JWJ Corporation and 
Jones. 
 
140.  These defendants, acting individually and in concert, 
have breached, and are continuing to breach, the obligations 
owed to plaintiff Cowboys Partnership and its owners as 
parties to, and/or intended third party beneficiaries of, 
the  Trust and License Agreements. 
 
141.  As described above, these defendants have also 
breached their obligations to plaintiff  Cowboys Partnership 
and its owners by  selling to third parties,  such as Nike, 
rights  that in fact belong to the Cowboys Partnership under 
the Trust  Agreement. 
 
142.  Plaintiff Cowboys Partnership and its owners have been 
injured by reason of these breaches in an amount presently 
unknown, but which will be proven at trial. 
 
143.  These defendants  activities and continuing breaches 
of the Trust and License Agreements are causing irreparable 
harm to plaintiff Cowboys Partnership and its owners and, 
unless restrained, will continue to do so. 
 
COUNT X 
 
Breach of NFL Governing Instruments 
 
(NFL, Tagliabue, Austrian and Does 41-60) 
 
144.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1 through 
143 as though fully set forth herein. 
 
145.  The Constitution and Bylaws, Rules and other 
agreements of the NFL, and the covenant of good faith and 
fair dealing implied therein, obligate defendants NFL, 
Tagliabue, Austrian, and other officials (Does 41-60) to 
treat each member club and owner in a fair, consistent, and 
equitable manner. 
 
146.  By engaging in the discriminatory and retaliatory 
conduct alleged above, these defendants have violated their 
obligations under these agreements. 
 
147.  Plaintiffs Cowboys Partnership, JWJ Corporation, and 
Jones have been injured by reason of these breaches in an 
amount presently unknown, but which will be proven at trial. 
 
148.  These defendants  activities and continuing breaches 
of these obligations are causing irreparable harm to 
plaintiff Cowboys Partnership and its owners, and unless 
restrained, will continue to do so. 
 
COUNT XI 
 
Breach of Fiduciary Duty 
 
(Trustees of NFL Trust) 
 
149.  As Trustees of the NFL Trust, defendants Paul 
Tagliabue, Daniel Rooney, and Does 1-20, owe the 
beneficiaries of the NFL Trust, including plaintiff Cowboys 
Partnership and its owners, the utmost duty to act in good 
faith in the best interest of the beneficiaries of the Trust 
and to protect their interests in the Trust assets.  It was 
in consideration of this duty, among others, that the clubs 
entered into the Trust Agreement. 
 
150.  The Trustees have breached those duties by, among 
other things, their gross negligence and recklessness and 
willful default in (a) failing to exercise oversight and 
control of the licensing and other activities of the Trust's 
exclusive licensing agent, NFL Properties; (b) failing to 
exercise oversight and control of the excessive expenses 
charged by NFL Properties against revenues derived from 
licensing the marks; (c) on nformation and belief, paying 
excessive amounts of the revenues received by the Trust to 
the NFL; (d) failing to arrange a tax- efficient structure 
for exploitation of the Club Marks; (e) failing to provide 
the beneficiaries of the Trust with an accurate and 
informative accounting of the Trust's activities; and (f) 
failing to prevent the above-described campaign of 
discrimination and harassment by NFL Properties against 
plaintiff Cowboys Partnership.    
 
151.  Plaintiffs Cowboys Partnership, JWJ Corporation, and 
Jones have been injured by reason of these breaches in an 
amount presently unknown, but which will be proven at trial. 
 
 
152.  The Trustees  activities and continuing breaches of 
their fiduciary duties are causing irreparable harm to these 
plaintiffs and, unless restrained, will continue to do so. 
 
COUNT XII 
 
Breach of Fiduciary Duty 
 
(NFL Properties) 
 
153.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1 through 
152 as though fully set forth herein. 
 
154.  As the exclusive licensing agent of the NFL Trust, 
defendant NFL Properties owes the NFL Trust and its 
beneficiaries, including plaintiff Cowboys Partnership, the 
utmost duty to act in good faith in the best interest of the 
Trust and its beneficiaries, and to protect their interests 
in the Trust Property.  It was in consideration of this 
duty, among others, that the clubs entered into the Trust 
Agreement and chose NFL Properties as the Trust's exclusive 
licensing agent. 
 
155.  NFL Properties has breached those duties by, among 
other things, (a) its gross negligence and recklessness in 
(1) engaging in mismanagement and wasteful spending, and (2) 
failing to arrange a tax-efficient structure for 
exploitation of the Club Marks; (b) its intentional 
participation in a conspiracy with other NFL Defendants to 
punish and selectively enforce rules against the Cowboys 
Partnership; and (c) its reckless failure to provide 
plaintiffs Cowboys Partnership and Jones with access to 
basic information concerning NFL Properties  finances and 
operations. 
 
156.  Plaintiff Cowboys Partnership has been injured by 
reason of these breaches in an amount presently unknown, but 
which will be proven at trial. 
 
157.  NFL Properties  activities and continuing breaches of 
its fiduciary duties are causing irreparable harm to 
plaintiff Cowboys Partnership and, unless restrained, will 
continue to do so. 
 
COUNT XIII 
 
Breach of Fiduciary Duty 
 
(NFL, Tagliabue, Austrian, Does 41-60) 
 
158.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1 through 
157 as though fully set forth herein. 
 
159.  Defendant National Football League, its Commissioner 
(Tagliabue), President (Austrian), and other officials (Does 
41-60) owe the member clubs, including plaintiff Cowboys 
Partnership and its owners, the utmost fiduciary duty to act 
in good faith in the best interests of the League and its 
member clubs, and to protect their interests. 
 
160.  As discussed above, on information and belief, 
defendants Tagliabue and Austrian assumed effective control 
of NFL Properties in or about 1993. 
 
161.  These defendants have breached those fiduciary duties 
by, among other things, (a) their gross negligence and 
recklessness in failing to exercise oversight and control of 
the licensing activities of NFL Properties and its 
employees; (b) their gross negligence and recklessness in 
failing to prevent mismanagement and wasteful spending; and 
(c) their intentional discrimination against plaintiffs by, 
among other things, selectively enforcing rules against 
plaintiff Cowboys Partnership and authorizing the filing of 
meritless claims against plaintiffs. 
 
162.  Plaintiffs Cowboys Partnership, JWJ Corporation, and 
Jones have been injured by reason of these breaches in an 
amount presently unknown, but which will be proven at trial. 
 
163.  The activities and continuing breaches of fiduciary 
duties by these defendants are causing irreparable harm to 
these plaintiffs, and, unless restrained, will continue to 
do so. 
 
COUNT XIV 
 
Breach of Common Law Due Process 
 
(NFL, Tagliabue, Austrian, Does 41-60) 
 
164.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1 through 
163 as though fully set forth herein. 
 
165.  As an association that controls major league 
professional football in the United States, defendant NFL, 
along with its Commissioner (Tagliabue), President 
(Austrian), and other officials (Does 41-60), owe the NFL's 
member clubs, including plaintiff Cowboys Partnership and 
its owners, a common law duty of due process.  This duty 
requires that the Constitution and Bylaws and rules of the 
NFL be enforced in a fair and nondiscriminatory way. 
 
166.  These defendants have breached this duty by 
threatening to apply, and by actually applying, the NFL's 
Constitution and Bylaws and rules to plaintiffs  conduct in 
an arbitrary, capricious, and discriminatory fashion. 
 
167.  Plaintiffs Cowboys Partnership, JWJ Corporation, and 
Jones have been injured by reason of these breaches in an 
amount presently unknown, but which will be proven at trial. 
 
168.  The activities and continuing breaches of this duty by 
these defendants have deprived plaintiffs Cowboys 
Partnership, JWJ Corporation, and Jones of fundamental 
fairness and substantial property and economic rights, and 
are otherwise causing irreparable harm to plaintiffs. 
Unless restrained, these activities will continue to cause 
irreparable harm to plaintiffs. 
 
COUNT XV 
 
Tortious Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage 
 
(NFL, NFL Properties, Executive Committee members, Levinson, 
Tagliabue, Austrian, and Does 21-60) 
 
169.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1 through 
168 as though fully set forth herein. 
 
170.  Plaintiffs Jones, Texas Stadium Corporation and Pro 
Silver Star have sought to raise funds by entering into 
contracts with potential sponsors of Texas Stadium, and have 
invested significant efforts and resources seeking to 
cultivate sponsor relationships.  Defendants are well aware 
of these efforts by plaintiffs. 
 
171.  The above-listed defendants, acting individually and 
in concert, have intentionally interfered with plaintiffs 
efforts to exercise rights that are either (a) expressly 
retained by the Cowboys Partnership under the Trust 
Agreement or (b) not implicated by that Agreement.  Among 
other things, on information and belief, these defendants, 
acting in concert, used their market and monopoly power in 
the market for professional football merchandise to force 
NFL Properties  licensees to alter their contracts with NFL 
Properties to include language inhibiting the licensees from 
entering into contracts similar to that between Pro Silver 
Star and Apex One concerning apparel to be worn by club 
personnel during games. 
 
172.  Similarly, these defendants, acting in concert, have 
used their control over professional football to require NFL 
member clubs to include in their coaches  contracts a 
provision prohibiting the coaches from wearing apparel on 
the sidelines that has not been dictated  by NFL Properties. 
 
173.  These defendants have sought to discourage 
corporations from becoming sponsors of Texas Stadium, and to 
raise plaintiffs  cost of consummating future sponsorship 
deals, by filing a meritless lawsuit attacking several Texas 
Stadium sponsorship transactions.  As set forth above, on 
information and belief, they  have also denied plaintiffs 
valuable business opportunities relating to Club Marks that 
they have granted to clubs favored by the NFL Defendants. 
 
174.  These defendants are aware that plaintiffs sponsorship 
and apparel contracts are an important source of income to 
plaintiffs, and have taken the actions described with 
malice, ill will, and for the purpose of harming plaintiffs 
by interfering with such contracts. 
 
175.  As set forth above, these defendants have also 
arbitrarily denied permission to plaintiffs to engage in 
licensing transactions that defendants have readily 
authorized for favored clubs. 
 
176.  These defendants have no justification or excuse for 
the actions described above, other than the purpose of 
interfering with plaintiffs  lawful business activities. 
 
177.  Plaintiffs have been injured by reason of these 
breaches in an amount presently unknown, but which will be 
proven at trial. 
 
178.  The activities and continuing breaches of this duty by 
these defendants are causing irreparable harm to plaintiffs 
and, unless restrained, will continue to do so. 
 
COUNT XVI 
 
Accounting of NFL Trust 
 
179.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1  through 
178  as though fully set forth herein. 
 
180.  Defendants NFL Trust and its Trustees have not 
provided plaintiff Cowboys Partnership and other 
beneficiaries of the NFL Trust an accounting of the funds 
received by its agent, NFL Properties.  Nor have these 
defendants provided the Cowboys Partnership an accounting of 
the funds received by the Trust and disbursed to the NFL or 
other entities, or used for other operations of the Trust. 
 
181.  Plaintiff Cowboys Partnership is entitled to a full 
and complete accounting of the receipts into and 
disbursements by the NFL Trust and its Trustees for each 
year since 1989.  Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law. 
 
COUNT XVII 
 
Accounting of NFL Properties 
 
182.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1  through 
181  as though fully set forth herein. 
 
183.  Defendants NFL Properties, its Executive Committee, 
President, and other officials (Does 21-40) have not 
provided plaintiffs  Cowboys Partnership and Jones or other 
directors or shareholders of NFL Properties an accounting of 
the funds received from licensing revenues and disbursed to 
the NFL Trust or other persons or entities. 
 
184.  Plaintiffs Cowboys Partnership and Jones are entitled 
to immediate access to the books and records of NFL 
Properties, and to a full and complete accounting of the 
receipts into and disbursements by NFL Properties, its 
Executive  Committee,  and its President for each year since 
1989.  Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law. 
 
COUNT XVIII 
 
Accounting of NFL 
 
185.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1  through 
184  as though fully set forth herein. 
 
186.  Defendants NFL, its Commissioner, President, and other 
officials (Does 41-60) have not provided to plaintiff 
Cowboys Partnership an accounting for the funds received 
from licensing revenues or other sources and disbursed on 
behalf of the NFL and its member clubs.  These defendants, 
pursuant to their fiduciary duties to the member clubs and 
the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing inherent in 
the NFL Constitution and Bylaws and the rules adopted 
thereunder, have a duty to provide the member clubs with 
such information. 
 
187.  Plaintiff Cowboys Partnership is entitled to a full 
and complete accounting of the receipts of and disbursements 
by the NFL for each year since 1989.  Plaintiff has no 
adequate remedy at law. 
 
COUNT XIX 
 
(Derivative) 
 
Breach of License Agreement 
 
(NFL Trust, Trustees, NFL Properties, Executive Committee 
members, Levinson, and Does 21-40) 
 
188.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1 through 
187  as though fully set forth herein. 
 
189.  This Count is brought derivatively on behalf of the 
NFL Trust. 
 
190.  Pursuant  to the terms of the License Agreement, 
defendant NFL Properties, its Executive Committee, 
President, and other officials (Does 21-40) are obligated to 
use their best efforts to utilize the Trust assets for the 
benefit of the beneficiaries.  This obligation arises under 
the express terms of the License Agreement, and under the 
implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing inherent in 
that Agreement. 
 
191.  These defendants have wasted the Trust's valuable 
assets through acts of mismanagement and waste, as described 
above.  Because these defendants  right to exploit the Trust 
assets is generally exclusive, their failure to manage these 
assets properly has caused great financial harm to 
plaintiffs. 
 
192.  In light of the Trustees  tolerance of such actions, 
to the detriment of the NFL Trust and its beneficiaries, 
their failure to enforce the Trust's rights under the 
License Agreement, their failure to supply plaintiffs with 
even minimal information, and their evident animus towards 
plaintiffs as shown by their repeated acts of discrimination 
and the filing of a $500 million lawsuit against plaintiffs, 
any further demand by plaintiff Cowboys Partnership on the 
Trustees would be futile. 
 
193.  Plaintiffs have not colluded to confer jurisdiction on 
this Court that it  would not otherwise have. 
 
194.  These defendants  activities and continuing breaches 
of their fiduciary duties are causing irreparable harm to 
plaintiff Cowboys Partnership and, unless restrained, will 
continue to do so.  Plaintiff Cowboys Partnership has been 
injured by reason of these breaches in an amount presently 
unknown, but which will be proven at trial.

NFL Trust. 
 
197.  As the exclusive licensing agent of the NFL Trust, 
defendant NFL Properties, its Executive Committee, 
President, and other officials (Does 21-40) owe the NFL 
Trust and its beneficiaries, including plaintiff Cowboys 
Partnership, the utmost fiduciary duty to act in good faith 
in the best interest of the Trust and its beneficiaries, and 
to maximize and protect their interests in the Trust assets. 
 
198.  These defendants have breached those duties by, among 
other things, (a) their gross negligence and recklessness 
in permitting or engaging in mismanagement  and wasteful 
spending;  (b)  their intentional participation in a 
conspiracy with other NFL Defendants to punish and 
selectively enforce rules against the Cowboys Partnership; 
and (c)  their failure to provide plaintiffs Cowboys 
Partnership and Jones with access to basic information 
concerning NFL Properties  finances and operations. 
 
199.  In light of the Trustees  tolerance of such actions, 
to the detriment of the NFL Trust and its beneficiaries, 
their failure to enforce the Trust's rights, their failure 
to supply plaintiffs with even minimal information, and 
their evident animus towards plaintiffs as shown by their 
repeated acts of discrimination and the filing of a $500 
million lawsuit against plaintiffs, any further demand by 
plaintiff Cowboys Partnership on the Trustees would be 
futile. 
 
200.  Plaintiffs have not colluded to confer jurisdiction on 
this Court that it  would not otherwise have. 
 
201.  These defendants  activities and continuing breaches 
of their fiduciaries duties are causing irreparable harm to 
plaintiffs Cowboys Partnership and Jones and, unless 
restrained, will continue to do to.  These plaintiffs have 
been injured by reason of these breaches in an amount 
presently unknown, but which will be proven at trial.

21-40) 
 
202.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1  through 
201  as though fully set forth herein. 
 
203.  This Count is brought derivatively on behalf of NFL 
Properties. 
 
204.  In performing their responsibilities in connection 
with NFL Properties, defendants Headrick, Weaver, Gutman, 
Rooney, Smith, and Levinson, and Does 21-40, as officers or 
members of the Executive Committee of NFL Properties, owe a 
duty to NFL Properties and its shareholders to manage the 
assets and operations of NFL Properties in good faith, 
according to their best judgment and skill, and in the 
interests of NFL Properties shareholders. 
 
205.  Among other obligations, these defendants owed a duty 
to NFL Properties and its shareholders adequately to manage 
and supervise the activities of NFL Properties and its 
employees, and to ensure that NFL Properties was properly 
and professionally operated to protect the financial 
interests of its shareholders. 
 
206.  These defendants were negligent or grossly negligent, 
and breached those duties through the acts, omissions and 
mismanagement described above. 
 
207.  In light of these defendants  tolerance of such 
actions, to the detriment of NFL Properties and its 
shareholders, their failure to supply plaintiffs with even 
minimal information, and their evident animus towards 
plaintiffs as shown by their repeated acts of discrimination 
and the filing of a $500 million lawsuit against plaintiffs, 
any further demand by plaintiff Cowboys Partnership would be 
futile. 
 
208.  Plaintiffs have not colluded to confer jurisdiction on 
this Court that it  would not otherwise have. 
 
209.  These defendants  activities and continuing negligence 
and mismanagement are causing irreparable harm to plaintiffs 
Cowboys Partnership and Jones and, unless restrained, will 
continue to do so.  These plaintiffs have been injured by 
reason of these breaches in an amount presently unknown, but 
which will be proven at trial.

Unjust Enrichment 
 
(NFL Properties) 
 
210.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1  through 
209  as though fully set forth herein. 
 
211.  As discussed above, NFL Properties has sold to Nike 
certain highly valuable rights that in fact belong to 
plaintiffs pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement.  By 
selling a right that lawfully belongs to plaintiffs, 
defendant NFL Properties has been and will continue to be 
unjustly enriched. 
 
212.  Plaintiffs  are entitled to disgorgement of the 
revenues wrongfully obtained by NFL Properties through this 
transaction. 
 
PRAYER FOR RELIEF

HORMEL FOODS CORPORATION,
Plaintiff,

-against-     

JIM HENSON PRODUCTIONS, INC.,
Defendant.

95 Civ. 5473 (KMW)

OPINION & ORDER

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _      X 

WOOD D.J.

This lawsuit is sparked by the prospective appearance of a new Muppet
who joins Kermit, Miss Piggy and others in the movie "Muppet Treasure
Island," due to be released in about four months. The creators of the
Muppets, Jim Henson Productions, Inc. ("Henson"), hope to provoke
laughter by naming the new Muppet (an exotic, wild boar) "Spa'am";
they believe that the association between the exotic, wild boar and
the tame, familiar luncheon meat, SPAM, will cause viewers to laugh.
Hormel Foods Corporation ("Hormel") which manufactures SPAM, finds
nothing humorous in the association, and fears that the use of the
Spa'am character will cause a drop off in the consumption of SPAM, and
a drop off in the consumption of SPAM tee-shirts and other
SPAM-related merchandise. Although Henson has urged Hormel,
effectively, to "lighten up," and to see the parody as a positive
development for Hormel (especially in light of the fact that SPAM is
regularly subjected to much more negative portrayals/1), Hormel
insists on its right to a legal determination of whether Henson's use
of the Spa'am character and name/2 are lawful. 


Specifically, Hormel alleges that Henson's proposed use of the Spa'am
character and name in the motion picture and on related merchandise
constitutes trademark infringement and false advertising in violation
of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.  1114(1), 1125(a) (1988). Additionally,
Hormel raises state law claims of common law unfair competition,
trademark dilution, N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law  368-d (McKinney 1984), and
deceptive practices, N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law  349 (McKinney 1988).   For
the reasons stated below, Hormel's claims are all denied. 


BACKGROUND


After a three-day bench trial, the court makes the following findings
of fact. Hormel has made and marketed its popular SPAM luncheon meat
since 1937. SPAM is a distinctive, well-known registered trademark.
Hormel produces, distributes and licenses numerous other products
bearing the SPAM mark, such as tee-shirts and golf balls, in addition
to its primary, luncheon meat product. The secondary products are
intended to be a source of additional revenue and to promote sales of
SPAM luncheon meat. Purchasers of the secondary products are generally
consumers of the luncheon meat and associate the secondary products
with the luncheon meat. (Grev Dep. at 28; Krejci Test., Tr. at 15.)
Hormel also employs SPAM- Man, a character dressed as a giant can of
SPAM luncheon meat, to promote the sale of SPAM. SPAM has been the
butt of numerous disparaging, unauthorized jokes. (Def. Ex. W.) 


Henson created a group of puppets, known collectively as the Muppets,
in the 1950's. Since that time, puppets have regularly been added to
the Muppet cast of characters. The Muppets have been featured in
numerous television programs and motion pictures, and are well-known
for parodies of brand names, trademarks, television programs,
fictional characters, and celebrities. Children who enjoy the Muppets
are familiar with the Muppet brand of humor and are unlikely to think
that the Muppets are sponsored by the products and celebrities who are
the subject of their jokes. 


Henson's upcoming motion picture, "Muppet Treasure Island," is
scheduled for release in the United States in February, 1996. In the
motion picture, familiar Muppet characters such as Kermit the Frog,
Miss Piggy and Rizzo Rat, land on Treasure Island where they encounter
a tribe of wild boars. The leader of the boars identifies himself as
"Spa'am, High Priest of the Boars." This is the only time that the
name "Spa'am" is spoken in the motion picture, and it is pronounced in
two distinct syllables, with both "a"'s pronounced as the "a" in SPAM.
When Spa'am first makes his appearance in the motion picture, he is
threatening, though in a humorous way; he accuses Kermit and other
Muppets of "violating" his island, and he has them tied to stakes.
However, toward the end of the motion picture, Spa'am helps Kermit and
the other Muppets escape from the clutches of the evil Long John
Silver. In the final scene, Spa'am is shown sailing away with the
other Muppets as good humor and camaraderie reign. 


Dr. Laura A. Peracchio, an expert in consumer behavior, states in her
report that Spa'am is unappealing and will lead to negative
associations on the part of consumers because he has small eyes,
protruding teeth, warts, a skull on his headdress, is generally
untidy, and speaks in a deep voice with poor grammar and diction. I
am, however, persuaded by the report and testimony of Anne Devereaux
Jordan, an expert in children's literature, who notes that children
(and adults) often have positive associations with characters that may
not appear classically handsome. Among other examples, Ms. Jordan
points to "Pumbaa," the good-natured warthog in Walt Disney's film The
Lion Kinq, and "Splinter," the aging rat who acts as teacher and
father-figure to the "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." Furthermore, a
boar sharing some of the characteristics that Dr. Peracchio relies on
has been used successfully as the image of meat products. See Def. Ex.
W (label from "Boar's Head Brand" beef frankfurters showing boar with
small eyes and protruding tusks). I agree with Ms. Jordan that a
narrow focus on Spa'am's physical appearance is insufficient to
determine whether consumers, of any age, will have positive or
negative associations with Spa'am. 


Hormel maintains that Spa'am appears unhygienic. Having viewed
excerpts from the motion picture involving Spa'am, the court sees no
evidence of lack of hygiene./3 Indeed, Hormel's expert witness, Dr.
Peracchio, testified that at worst the character appears "untidy,"
pointing to the drooping feathers on Spa'am's headdress. Although Dr.
Peracchio would draw the inference of lack of personal hygiene from
the character's untidiness, the court finds that such a leap is
unwarranted. 


Hormel contends that Spa'am's unappealing physical appearance is
reinforced by his bad behavior, all tending towards negative
associations on the part of consumers. Jerrold Robinson, a licensing
expert, states that Spa'am is a negative character because his tribe
of wild boars captures Kermit the Frog and Rizzo Rat. Hormel submits,
as additional evidence of Spa'am's negativity, scenes from the motion
picture in which Spa'am's tribe ties Kermit and Rizzo to stakes and in
which Spa'am flees when confronted by firearms. I agree with Ms.
Jordan, however, that the Spa'am character is unlikely to be viewed as
negative in the context of the motion picture as a whole. Spa'am,
although initially threatening the Muppet heros, ultimately helps them
to escape from the villainous Long John Silver. At the end of the
film, Spa'am sails away with the other Muppets as an accepted member
of their group. As Ms. Jordan notes, even when Spa'am is behaving in a
threatening or cowardly manner, he seems childish rather than evil.
The character's grammar reinforces its childlike qualities. I disagree
with Dr. Peracchio that Spa'am's later behavior is "inconsistent"
with, and hence will not dispel, his initially threatening impression.
Spa'am is initially threatening, in a humorous, childish way, when he
believes that the other Muppets have trespassed on his island. When
Spa'am realizes that Long John Silver is the true villain, Spa'am
joins the Muppet camp. The character's behavior, viewed as a whole, is
consistent and unlikely to lead to negative associations. 


Hormel has submitted evidence indicating some confusion about the
spelling and pronunciation of the Spa'am name. A newspaper article in
the London Sundav Mirror identified the leader of the wild boars in
the motion picture as "Spam." (Pl. Ex. 43.) An article in the New York
Times about the instant lawsuit contained the reference "SPA'AM
(pronounced SPAM)." (Pl. Ex. 42.) The script from a CD-ROM game being
produced by one of Henson's licensees refers to the Spa'am character
as SPAM. (Pl. Ex. 55.) I note that this misspelling occurs only in the
script's designation of the speaker -- it was not intended to appear
on screen. 


Henson has entered into promotional agreements in connection with
MuPPet Treasure Island with General Mills, McDonald's and Hershey
Chocolate, and is negotiating promotional agreements with Dole and
Baskin Robbins. Pursuant to the agreements, General Mills will use
characters from the movie on "Cheerios" breakfast cereal boxes and
McDonald's will use vignettes from the movie on "Happy Meals" boxes.
Hershey Chocolate plans to market "Hershey's Amazin' Fruit" candies
molded in shapes from the motion picture, including, tentatively, one
in the shape of Spa'am./4 


Henson has also entered into licensing agreements pursuant to which
characters from the motion picture will appear in a CD-ROM video game,
in books, on apparel, and on other items. Henson may enter into
additional licensing agreements in the future. Currently, Henson has
authorized licensees to use the Spa'am character's likeness, but not
the name "Spa'am," on licensed merchandise. In all such uses, the
title of the motion picture, Muppet Treasure Island, will appear
prominently on the merchandise. Henson would like to permit licensees
to use the name "Spa'am" on merchandise in the future. In all examples
provided by Henson of such potential future uses, the name "Spa'am"
appears next to the likeness of the character and the title of the
motion picture is prominently displayed. Consumers of merchandise
bearing the likeness and/or name of Spa'am will buy it because they
like Spa'am, the Muppets, and/or MuPPet Treasure Island -- not because
they mistakenly think it is SPAM-related merchandise. An early version
of the "licensing style guide," (Pl. Ex. 46), distributed to potential
licensees, contained the likeness and name Spa'am (the Spa'am name has
been deleted from the style guide pending the outcome of the instant
case). Spa'am was described as the "noble . . . leader of the tribe of
wild boars that live on Treasure Island." Another page of the
licensing style guide described the wild boars in general as "proud
yet grotesque" and noted that "[w]hat they lack in personal hygiene,
they make up for in bravery and loud, spirited grunting." Scarves with
the name and likeness of Spa'am were distributed as gifts to potential
licensees. (Pl. Ex. 47.) All the pages of the licensing style guide
state in small print that "character names and likenesses are
trademarks of Jim Henson Productions, Inc." The symbol "TM" appears on
the scarves beside the name "Spa'am." 


DISCUSSION


I. Lanham Act


A. Trademark Infringement


Section 32(1) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. 1114(1) (1988), provides in
pertinent part: 


Any person who shall, without the consent of the registrant-- (a) use
in commerce any reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colorable imitation
of a registered mark in connection with the sale, offering for sale,
distribution or advertising of any goods or services on or in
connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion, or to
cause mistake, or to deceive . . . shall be liable in a civil action
by the registrant for the remedies hereinafter provided. 


"It is well settled that the crucial issue in an action for trademark
infringement or unfair competition is whether there is any likelihood
that an appreciable number of ordinarily prudent purchasers are likely
to be misled, or indeed simply confused, as to the source of the goods
in question." Universal City Studios. Inc. v. Nintendo Co.. Ltd., 746
F.2d 112, 115 (2d Cir. 1984) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Hormel notes, correctly, that the confusion need not be as to the
source of the product in question. "The public's belief that the
mark's owner sponsored or otherwise approved of the use of the
trademark satisfies the confusion requirement." Dallas Cowboy
Cheerleaders. Inc. v. Pussycat Cinema. Ltd., 604 F.2d 200, 204-05 (2d
Cir. 1979). 


Traditionally, courts in the Second Circuit consider the eight factors
set out in Polaroid Corp. v. Polaroid Elec. Corp., 287 F.2d 492, 495
(2d Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 820 (1961), to determine likelihood
of confusion for purposes of the Lanham act: (1) strength of
plaintiff's mark, (2) similarity of uses, (3) proximity of the
products, (4) likelihood that the prior owner will bridge the gap
(this refers to one of the manufacturers expanding into the domain of
the other), (5) actual confusion, (6) defendant's good or bad faith in
using plaintiff's mark, (7) quality of the junior user's product, (8)
sophistication of consumers. The Polaroid factors are not exclusive,
and, in evaluating them, "a court should focus on the ultimate
question of whether consumers are likely to be confused." Paddington
Corp. v. Attiki Importers & Distributors. Inc., 996 F.2d 577, 584 (2d
Cir. 1993). 


The Second Circuit has held that the First Amendment provides partial
protection from Lanham Act claims when artistic expression is at
stake. Cliffs Notes. Inc. v. Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group.
Inc., 886 F.2d 490, 493-97 (2d Cir. 1989) (holding that "Spy Notes", a
parody of Cliffs Notes study guides, did not violate Lanham Act). In
Cliffs Notes, the court began with "the proposition that parody is a
form of artistic expression, protected by the First Amendment," but
noted that "trademark protection is not lost simply because the
allegedly infringing use is in connection with a work of artistic
expression." Id. at 493 (citations and internal quotations omitted).
The court endorsed a balancing test according to which the reach of
the Lanham Act would be decided by "weigh[ing] the public interest in
free expression against the public interest in avoiding consumer
confusion." Id. at 494. 


The Cliffs Notes court did not dispense with the Polaroid factors, but
stated: 


The Polaroid test has its origins in cases of purely commercial
exploitation, which do not raise First Amendment concerns. Thus, the
Polaroid test is at best awkward in the context of parody, which must
evoke the original and constitutes artistic expression. In such a
situation, the Polaroid factors should be applied with proper weight
given to First Amendment considerations . . . 


Id. at 495, n.3. Thus, Cliffs Notes leaves the Polaroid test intact,
while warning district courts to keep the First Amendment in mind and
not read the Lanham Act too broadly. If a parody were very likely to
confuse consumers, however, the First Amendment would not protect it: 


A parody must convey two simultaneous -- and contradictory --
messages: that it is the original, but also that it is not the
original and is instead a parody. To the extent that it does only the
former but not the latter, it is not only a poor parody but also
vulnerable under the trademark law. 



Id. at 494.


I turn to the Polaroid factors:


1. Strenqth of Plaintiff's Mark


It is not disputed that SPAM is a strong mark. Hormel cites decisions
indicating that this factor would generally be a point in its favor.
E.g., MGM-Pathe Communications Co. v. Pink Panther Patrol, 774 F.
Supp. 869, 874 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) ("the more distinctive the mark, the
more clearly it is that confusion will result from additional entities
trading under it"). However, the cases cited by Hormel are not parody
cases, and, as Judge Leval has noted, "[w]here the plaintiff's mark is
being used as part of a jest or commentary, the opposite can be true."
Yankee Publishinq Inc. v. News America Publishing Inc., 809 F. Supp.
267, 273 (S.D.N.Y. 1992). In this case, SPAM is not only a strong
mark, but, as Hormel concedes, it has been the butt of numerous,
disparaging, unauthorized jokes. It follows that consumers are
unlikely to believe that yet another joke at SPAM's expense was
sponsored by Hormel. Hormel also concedes that Henson is well- known
for engaging in parody, including parodies of brand names; the Muppet
"ethic" thus includes the sort of joking that is at issue in this
case. As in Yankee Publishinq, "[i]t is precisely because both
plaintiffs' and defendants' marks are strong, well recognized and
clearly associated in the consumers' mind with a particular distinct
ethic that confusion is avoided." 809 F. Supp. at 273. 


2. Similarity of the Marks


Obviously "Spa'am" and "SPAM" are similar (for parody to work, they
need to be similar -- this is one way in which the Polaroid factors
are "awkward" when applied to parody). However, they are also easily
distinguishable, both when written and when spoken -- Spa'am is
written in two distinct syllables and is pronounced in two distinct
syllables in the motion picture. Furthermore, "an inquiry into the
degree of similarity between two marks does not end with a comparison
of the marks themselves . . . [T]he setting in which a designation is
used affects its appearance and colors the impression conveyed by it."
Sprinq Mills. Inc. v. Ultracashmere House Ltd., 689 F.2d 1127, 1130
(2d Cir. 1982). In this case, because Spa'am always appears in the
context of a Muppet motion picture (whether in the motion picture
itself or on related merchandise), and because the Muppets are known
for parodying brand names and celebrities, consumers are unlikely to
confuse the character Spa'am with SPAM products, or to believe that
the joking reference to the luncheon meat was sponsored by Hormel. 


3. Proximity of the Products and 4. Bridqina the Gap 


SPAM is a luncheon meat; Spa'am is the character of a wild boar in a
Muppet motion picture. One might think that more need not be said.
Hormel argues, however, that there is direct competition between them
because Henson will license the marketing of clothing and other
products bearing the Spa'am character (and proposes to add the Spa'am
name to some products) and Hormel also markets clothing and other
products bearing the SPAM mark. /5 Furthermore, Hormel contends that
the character Spa'am is in direct competition with Hormel's own
"SPAM-Man." Clearly, however, the products and characters in each case
derive their associations from a primary product -- luncheon meat, in
the case of SPAM, and a Muppet motion picture, in the case of Spa'am.
Indeed, Hormel's own witnesses testified that SPAM luncheon meat was
Hormel's primary product and that purchasers of SPAM merchandise would
generally be consumers of the luncheon meat. In all planned and
proposed uses of the Spa'am likeness and/or name, Spa'am looks like a
Muppet-style puppet, and appears with the name of the motion picture,
Muppet Treasure Island, prominently displayed, making it highly likely
that consumers will associate the merchandise with the Muppets and the
motion picture. The primary products that the other merchandise refer
to, namely the luncheon meat and the motion picture, are sufficiently
far apart that consumer confusion is unlikely. In this regard, the
instant case is similar to Universal City Studios. Inc. v. Nintendo
Co., 746 F.2d 112 (2d Cir. 1984), where the court, considering the
marketing of items related to the allegedly infringing "Donkey Kong"
videogame, took account of the strong effect of the video product in
forming consumer impressions of the associated products: 


[S]ince the videogame is by far the dominant source of goodwill for
these characters, consumer impressions of these other items are likely
to be generated by the videogame, diminishing the possibility that the
items will create more confusion among consumers than the videogame
itself. Finally, these items have the same "total concept and feel" as
the videogame and just as obviously are unlikely to be confused with
King Kong. 


Id. at 117 n.7.


5. Actual Confusion


As proof of actual confusion, Hormel cites an article from the London
Sundav Mirror that identified the leader of the wild boars as "Spam,"
and a New York Times article containing the reference "SPA'AM
(pronounced SPAM)." Hormel also submits the script from the CD-ROM
game being produced by one of Henson's licensees which refers to the
Spa'am character as SPAM. While these are proof of some confusion as
to the spelling and pronunciation of the character's name, they are
not proof of any confusion over Hormel's sponsorship of, or
association with, the character. Furthermore, at least as far as the
New York Times article is concerned, that article was about the
instant lawsuit, and thus the Times' assumption regarding the
pronunciation may have been influenced by the very fact that Hormel is
suing. Finally, any confusion over the pronunciation of Spa'am is
likely to be lessened once the motion picture is released and more
people hear the correct pronunciation. 


6. Defendant's Good or Bad Faith


Hormel argues that it is clear that Henson intended to capitalize on
the goodwill and reputation of its trademark and that this implies bad
faith. I disagree. Henson acknowledges that it meant to invoke
Hormel's trademark as a joke. This does not mean that Henson intended
to cause confusion in the minds of consumers. As the Tenth Circuit has
pointed out: 


In one sense, a parody is an attempt to derive benefit from the
reputation of the owner of the mark, if only because no parody could
be made without the initial mark. The benefit to the one makinq the
parodv however. arises from the humorous association. not from public
confusion as to the source of the marks. A parody relies upon a
difference from the original mark, presumably a humorous difference,
in order to produce its desired effect. 


Jordache Enterprises. Inc. v. Hoqq Wyld Ltd., 828 F. 2d 1482, 1486
(lOth Cir. 1987) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)
(emphasis added). 


7. Ouality of Defendant's Products


Hormel argues that "[t]he Spa'am character in no way embodies the same
characteristics and qualities that Hormel Foods' SPAM luneheon meat
embodies." Hormel diseusses at length the alleged uneleanliness and
ugliness of Spa'am. In effeet, Hormel attempts to injeet into its
Lanham Act elaim its arguments with respeet to the alleged
"tarnishment" of its trademark, a state-law elaim diseussed infra.
These arguments are beside the point -- trademark infringement under
the Lanham Aet requires a showing of likelihood of eonsumer eonfusion
as to source or sponsorship. The quality factor eould be relevant in
one of two ways -- (1) to the injury stemming from confusion (if
defendant's product is inferior, injury from eonfusion eould be
exacerbated), (2) to the likelihood of eonfusion (two products of
equal quality could increase the likelihood of confusion). Girls
Scouts v. Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group Inc., 808 F. Supp.
1112, 1129 (S.D.N.Y. 1992), aff'd, 996 F.2d 1477 (2d Cir. 1993).
Hormel has not made either argument. 


8. Sophistication of Consumers


Hormel argues that consumers of both products are in large part
children -- a particularly unsophisticated group. However, the eourt
has found that children who enjoy the Muppets are unlikely to believe
that the Muppets are sponsored by the myriad products and celebrities
who are the subject of their jokes. In considering consumer
sophistication, courts often look at whether the purchase of the
product in question would tend to be the result of "impulse" buying or
a hasty decision, making it more likely that the consumer would
confuse products. Id. As the court has found, a consumer, whether
child or adult, would want a Spa'am tee-shirt because he likes the
Muppets, not because he mistakenly thinks that it is a SPAM tee-shirt.
There is thus no likelihood that even impulse buying or hasty
decision-making will result in a confused purchase decision. 


Thus, all the Polaroid factors are either inapplicable or favor
Henson. It follows that Hormel cannot succeed on its trademark
infringement claim because it has failed to show likelihood of
consumer confusion. 


Hormel disagrees with this analysis. Hormel argues, in fact, that
Henson's use of Spa'am is not a parody at all because Henson has not
made clear that the Spa'am character is not affiliated with or
approved by Hormel. Hormel points out that the parody at issue in
Cliff Notes was prominently marked as a satire. This same argument was
attempted by the plaintiff in Yankee Publishing, to which Judge Leval
responded: 


There is no requirement that a parody identify itself by a label
stating, "a parody." Such a legend can, of course, be helpful in
avoiding confusion. If a defendant causes too much unnecessary
confusion in using another's trademark, that confusion can tip the
scale of the balancing test in the plaintiff's favor. But a "parody"
label is not required. 809 F. Supp. at 281. 


Hormel also cites Anheuser-Busch. Inc. v. Balducci Publications, 28
F.3d 769 (8th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 903 (1995), in
which the court found that a parody of a Michelob beer advertisement
violated the Lanham Act. However, in that case, as the court pointed
out, plaintiff "possessed several very strong trademarks that
[defendant] displayed virtually unaltered in the ad parody." Id. at
774. Indeed, the spelling of Michelob is unchanged in the disputed
advertisement, and the bottles have the shape and look of Michelob
bottles. The court also pointed out that defendant "published the
parody on the back cover of a magazine -- a location frequently
devoted to real ads." Id. The court concluded that defendant
"carefully desiqned the fictitious ad to appear as authentic as
possible . . [and] sought to do far more than just 'conjure up' the
original." Id. This is not the case here. Among the many differences
are the fact that Henson does not portray fake cans of SPAM; the name
of Spa'am is a clearly altered version of the original name; and the
context, a Muppet motion picture and related merchandise, serves to
clearly identify the name as a joke. 


By its nature, a parody intends to 'conjure up' the original that is
being parodied. It follows that there is inevitably the possibility
that some consumers will be confused. However, when, as in this case,
the trademark has been altered and placed in a context that clearly
distinguishes it from the original, a Lanham Act trademark
infringement claim will not succeed. Indeed, Lanham Act claims have
failed in cases that raise a much greater likelihood of confusion. For
example, Universal City Studios. Inc. v. Nintendo Co. Ltd., 746 F.2d
112 (2d Cir. 1984), involved a suit by the holder of the trademark
"King Kong" (the court assumed arquendo that the trademark was valid)
against the maker of a videogame entitled "Donkey Kong." The
videogame, like the King Kong story, involved "a gorilla, a captive
woman, a male rescuer and a building scenario." Id. at 117. The court
upheld the district court grant of summary judgment, stating: "the
fact that Donkey Kong so obviously parodies the King Kong theme
strongly contributes to dispelling confusion on the part of
consumers." Id. at 116; see also Jordache Enterprises v. Hogg Wyld.
Ltd., 828 F.2d 1482 (lOth Cir. 1987) (rejecting Jordache's Lanham Act
claim against maker of "Lardashe" blue jeans for larger women); Yankee
Publishinq, 809 F. Supp. 267 (rejecting Lanham Act claim concerning
New York magazine cover that parodied the Old Farmer's Almanac);
Universal City Studios. Inc. v. Tee-shirt Gallery Ltd., 634 F. Supp.
1468, 1477 (S.D.N.Y 1986) (refusing to issue preliminary injunction
against makers of "Miami Mice" tee-shirts parodying the Miami Vice
television series, in part because "tt]he strength of this parody
highlights the differences between the two products and should further
dispel any confusion on the part of consumers that plaintiffs
manufactured, authorized sponsored, or were in any way connected with
the tee-shirts."); Tetley Inc. v. Topps Chewing Gum Inc., 556 F. Supp.
785 (E.D.N.Y. 1983) (refusing to issue preliminary injunction against
maker of "Petley Flea Bags" stickers that were designed to be a
replica of the Tetley Tea Bags box); Girls Scouts v. Personality
Posters Manufacturinq Co., 304 F. Supp. 1228 (S.D.N.Y. 1969) (refusing
to issue preliminary injunction against maker of poster showing
obviously pregnant girl dressed in Girl Scout uniform and bearing the
motto "Be Prepared"). 


In short, Hormel cannot use federal trademark laws to enjoin what is
obviously a joke at its expense. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals
aptly quoted Will Rogers for the following proposition: 


Now everything is funny as long as it is happening to somebody Else,
but when it happens to you, why it seems to lose some of its Humor,
and if it keeps on happening, why the entire laughter kinder Fades out
of it. 


Jordache, 828 F.2d at 1486 (quoting W. Rogers, Warning to Jokers, in
The Illiterate Diqest, I-3 The Writings of Will Roqers 75 (1974)). The
court went on to note that the same is true for trademark law: 


No one likes to be the butt of a joke, not even a trademark. But the
requirement of trademark law is that a likely confusion of source,
sponsorship or affiliation must be proven, which is not the same thing
as a "right" not to be made fun of. 


Id. (quoting 2 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition 31:38 at
670 (2d ed. 1984)). 


B. False Advertisinq


Section 43(a) of the Lannam Act, 15 U.S.C. 1125(a), bars any "false or
misleading representation of fact" that "misrepresents the nature,
characteristics, qualities or geographic origin of his or her or
another person's goods, services or commercial activities." 


Hormel claims that Henson "falsely personifies SPAM as a nasty pagan
brute." (Hormel Reply Brief at 28). The only case cited by Hormel in
support of this apparently novel cause of action is Coca- Cola Co. v.
Tropicana Prods.. Inc., 690 F.2d 312, 318 (2d Cir. 1982). In that
case, Tropicana aired a commercial that showed someone squeezing an
orange and pouring the juice into a Tropicana carton. The court held
that this could constitute false advertising because Tropicana orange
juice is heated and sometimes frozen prior to packaging and, thus, is
not produced as the commercial represented. Hormel draws the
conclusion that "a false visual image of a trademark is actionable
under the Lanham Act just like a false statement." While this is
undoubtedly true in the context of apparently factual representations
or statements, I agree with Henson that "[t]he naming and depiction of
the Spa'am character is not a statement of fact, but a spoof -- the
very antithesis of fact." (Henson Brief at 28.) 


Hormel claims, as another example of false advertising, that Henson
falsely represented that it holds valid trademark rights in the name
and likeness of Spa'am -- "a mark that infringed and diluted Hormel
Food's SPAM mark." (Hormel Reply Brief at 28.) This accusation is
based on boilerplate on a page from an early version of a "licensing
style guide" describing the Spa'am character, and on scarves that were
distributed as gifts to potential licensees with a likeness of Spa'am
and a "TM"6 symbol beside the name Spa'am. Hormel's argument has as
its premise that Spa'am does infringe its trademark. Because I do not
accept the premise that it does infringe, Hormel's argument fails. 


II. Unfair Competition and Deceptive Practices 


"Under New York law, common law unfair competition claims closely
resemble Lanham Act claims, except insofar as state law claims may
require an additional element of bad faith or intent." Girl Scouts,
808 F. Supp. at 1131.   Thus, the above analysis applies to Hormel's
unfair competition claim, and the court finds no unfair competition
here. 


Hormel also claims that Henson has violated New York's deceptive
practices statute, N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law  349, because (1) Henson's act
or practice is misleading in a material respect; and (2) Hormel has
been injured. (Hormel Brief at 13.) The arguments raised by Hormel in
support of this claim are identical to those raised with respect to
the false advertising claim, and Hormel provides no citation to any
decision in which the statute has been applied to this sort of
situation. I find that Henson has not been "deceptive" within the
meaning of the statute. 


III. Dilution


New York's anti-dilution statute provides: 


Likelihood of injury to business reputation or of dilution of the
distinctive quality of a mark or trade name shall be a ground for
injunctive relief in cases of infringement of a mark registered or not
registered or in cases of unfair competition, notwithstanding the
absence of competition between the parties or the absence of confusion
as to the source of qoods or services. 


N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law  368-d. Thus, unlike trademark infringement under
the Lanham Act, consumer confusion is not an element of this offense.
Nevertheless, as Judge Leval has noted, "w]hile dilution even without
confusion, can sustain a cause of action under the New York statute,
the factors are, on the whole, quite similar to those involved in a
federal cause of action under the Lanham Act." Yankee Publishinq, 809
F. Supp. at 282. 


"In order to prevail on a section 368-d dilution claim, a plaintiff
must prove, first that its trademark either is of truly distinctive
quality or has acquired secondary meaning, and, second, that there is
a likelihood of dilution." Deere & Co. v. MTD Prods. Inc., 41 F.3d 39,
42 (2d Cir. 1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). There is no
dispute in this case that SPAM is a distinctive mark; the only
question is whether Hormel can prove likelihood of dilution. 


Violations of  368-d can be divided into three categories: (1)
blurring, (2) tarnishment, and (3) other. In Deere, the court stated:
"Traditionally this court has defined dilution under section 368-d as
either the blurring of a mark's product identification or the
tarnishment of the affirmative associations a mark has come to
convey." Id. at 42. However, the court went on to say that "the
blurring/tarnishment dichotomy does not represent the full range of
uses that can dilute a mark under New York law." Id. at 44. The Deere
court did not decide the parameters of this third category of
dilution. 


A. Blurrinq


"Blurring" refers to "the whittling away of an established trademark's
selling power and value through its unauthorized use by others upon
dissimilar products." Mead Data Central. Inc. v. Tovota Motor Sales
U.S.A. Inc., 875 F.2d 1026, 1031 (2d Cir. 1989). Hormel has not cited,
and the court has not found, a single decision in which a court found
blurring in violation of  368-d in a parody case. This is not
surprising, because, as one commentator has noted, "the use of famous
marks in parodies causes no loss of distinctiveness, since the success
of the use depends upon the continued association of the mark with the
plaintiff." Robert C. Denicola, "Trademarks as Speech,"   1982 Wis. L.
Rev. 158, 188 (quoted in Yankee Pub., 809 F. Supp. at 282); see also
Jordache, 828 F.2d at 1490 (quoting the district court's finding that
"[b]ecause of the parody aspect of Lardashe, it is not likely that
public identification of JORDACHE with the plaintiff will be eroded;
indeed, parody tends to increase public identification of a
plaintiff's mark with the plaintiff"). Hormel is unlikely to suffer
weakening of its mark, because, as Hormel acknowledges, the joke
relies on (and thus reinforces) the distinctiveness of the SPAM mark. 


In Universal City Studios, the Second Circuit upheld the district
court's grant of summary judgment to defendant on plaintiff's dilution
claim, stating: "We find that the names and characters in dispute are
so different that no reasonable question of fact was raised on the
issue of blurring." 746 F.2d at 120. In that case, the names at issue
were "Donkey Kong" and "King Kong," and the characters were both
gorillas who had captured women and were holding them prisoner on top
of buildings, although one, according to the court, was "ferocious"
while the other was "farcical." Id. at 116. In this case, the names
are "Spa'am" and SPAM, are quite similar, but the "characters" are a
wild boar puppet and a can of luncheon meat -- significantly farther
apart than two gorillas. 


B. Tarnishment


"'Tarnishment' generally arises when the plaintiff's trademark is
linked to products of shoddy quality, or is portrayed in an
unwholesome or unsavory context." Deere, 41 F.3d at 43. Hormel does
not contend that Henson's motion picture and related products are of
shoddy quality, but rather maintains that its trademark will be
tarnished due to negative associations stemming from Spa'am's
"unsavory" likeness and behavior. Henson argues that a finding of
tarnishment requires a depiction of plaintiff's mark in a context of
sexual activity, obscenity, or illegality. I disagree. Although the
Second Circuit Court of Appeals has stated that tarnishment is
"usually" found in such contexts, id. at 44, courts have found
tarnishment in other circumstances, see, e.g., Chemical Corp. v.
Anheuser-8usch. Inc., 306 F.2d 433 (5th Cir. 1962) (finding
unwholesome association between plaintiff's beer slogan, "Where
there's life . . . there's Bud," and defendant's insecticide slogan,
"Where there's life . . . there's Bugs"), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 965
(1963)./7 


With respect to its claim of tarnishment, Hormel urges the court to
consider the impact that association with Spa'am could have on the
sales of SPAM in particular, given Spa'am's allegedly unhygienic
appearance. Hormel relies on Henson's promotional statement that the
boars of Treasure Island, though not Spa'am specifically, lack
personal hygiene. However, I have found no evidence that Spa'am
appears unhygienic in the motion picture. Hormel's allegations of lack
of hygiene are insufficient to support its claim of tarnishment. See
Tetlev Inc., 556 F. Supp. at 794 (rejecting a tarnishment claim
because "[w]hile plaintiff complains that defendant's childish humor,
in choosing the rhyme word 'flea' to parody its tea, will result in
images of impurity, adulteration, and contamination in the minds of
its customers, it has offered absolutely no evidence to that effect.")



Hormel also argues that its trademark will tarnished by association
with Spa'am as a result of the character's allegedly threatening and
cowardly behavior. However, Hormel has cited no decisions, and the
court has discovered none, finding tarnishment in a case involving as
indirect a negative association as the one proposed by Hormel here --
that is, the association between unpleasant personality traits of a
character and the quality of a food product. Even assuming that such
an association could support a cause of action for tarnishment, the
court has found that negative associations with Spa'am are unlikely
given the character's childlike qualities and ultimately positive
behavior. 


Moreover, Hormel's view that its trademark is portrayed in an
"unsavory context" is based on a narrow view of the context in this
case, restricted to the Spa'am character and its behavior. The wider
context finds the Spa'am character in a high-quality, good- humored,
family-oriented motion picture. Association with such an enterprise is
unlikely to tarnish Hormel's trademark. I don't believe, and Hormel
has found no caselaw to suggest, that a humorous reference in such a
context, suggesting little more than that SPAM is made out of pork,
can constitute tarnishment. 


Finally, Hormel's argument is further weakened by the evidence
submitted by Henson, consisting of newspaper articles, cartoons, and
excerpts from television shows, which suggest that Hormel should
consider itself fortunate to be associated with a Muppet version of a
wild boar -- many associations are less kind. See, e.q., supra note 1.
To the extent that SPAM is popular and highly regarded by consumers as
Hormel claims, that popularity exists in spite of a media barrage of
highly negative humor at SPAM's expense. I find it incredible that
whatever "affirmative associations" the SPAM brand has come to convey
in the face of this negative humor would be tarnished by Henson's not
particularly offensive joke. Indeed, in the context of parody, courts
have rejected claims of tarnishment based on much more offensive
jokes, directed at products that have not been the target of the sort
of calumny that SPAM has suffered. See, e.q., L.L. Bean. Inc. v. prake
Publishers. Inc., 811 F.2d 26 (lst Cir.) (reversing district court
finding of tarnishment in case of prurient parody of plaintiff's
catalog entitled "L.L. Beam's Back-To-School-Sex- Catalog"), cert.
denied, 483 U.S. 1013 (1987).   Hormel has not shown that Henson's use
of the Spa'am likeness or name is likely to tarnish the SPAM mark. 


C. Other


In Deere, the court stated that blurring and tarnishment do not
constitute the only forms of dilution prohibited by  368-d. However,
the court cautioned that "we must be careful not to broaden section
368-d to prohibit all uses of a distinctive mark that the owner
prefers not be made." 41 F.3d at 44. The court explicitly exempted
from the reach of 368-d "[s]atirists, selling no product other than
the publication that contains their expression [who] wish to parody a
mark to make a point of social commentary, to entertain, or perhaps
both to comment and entertain." 41 F.3d at 44 (citations omitted).
Thus, the use of Spa'am in the motion picture seems safe from attack
under  368-d. It is less clear that the merchandising related to the
motion picture will be protected on this basis although Henson argues
that the merchandise contains protected expression of its own. 


The Deere court went on to consider alterations to trademarks in
parodies that were being used to sell products other than the works
containing the parodies themselves. Focussing on advertising spoofs,
the court stated that: 


[S]ome alterations have the potentlal to so lessen tne selling power
of a distinctive mark that they are appropriately proscribed by a
dilution statute. Dilution of this sort is more likely to be found
when the alterations are made by a competitor with both incentive to
diminish the favorable attributes of the mark and an ample opportunity
to promote its products in ways that make no significant alteration. 


41 F.3d at 45. Hormel argues that this case falls squarely within this
language because of the "competition" between Hormel and Henson in the
marketing of tee-shirts and other products. I find that Hormel's
reliance on Deere for the proposition that  368-d reaches the conduct
at issue in this case is misplaced. In Deere, a direct competitor of
John Deere's, for the sole purpose of promoting its competing lawn
mower, used an altered version of John Deere's logo in a television
commercial. Deere would apply to this case only if Henson had used the
altered version of Hormel's trademark in comparative advertising, that
is, with the intention of persuading consumers to purchase Muppet
merchandise rather than SPAM merchandise. This is clearly not the case
here. Henson altered Hormel's mark for entertainment purposes in a
motion picture. The fact that the altered trademark may then be used
on merchandise marketed in connection with the motion picture, does
not bring the conduct within the third category of dilution discussed
in Deere. 


Thus, I find that Hormel has failed to show a likelihood of dilution.
This is, by itself, fatal to Hormel's  368-d claim. However, my
conclusion that the  368-d claim must be dismissed is further
supported by my earlier finding that Henson acted in good faith. It
follows that Henson did not have "predatory intent," that is, the
intent "of either appropriating for itself the goodwill associated
with the plaintiff's name and/or mark, or of capitalizing on consumer
confusion between the two products." Giorqio Beverly Hills. Inc. v.
Revlon Consumer Prods. Corp., 869 F. Supp. 176, 185 (S.D.N.Y. 1994).
Although the New York courts have not decided whether a showing of
predatory intent is required to find a violation of the anti-dilution
statute, it is, at the very least, a relevant factor. Deere, 41 F.3d
at 46. 


CONCLUSION


For the reasons stated above, Hormel's claims are denied. I note as
guidance to the parties, see supra note 2, that it follows from the
reasoning of the above Opinion that the Spa'am likeness and name may
be used on merchandise that clearly identifies Spa'am as a character
from a Muppet motion picture, because such uses would be unlikely to
cause consumer confusion or dilute Hormel's trademark. 


SO ORDERED.


DATED: New York, New York

Kimba M. Wood

United States District Judqe


Copies of this order have been mailed to counsel for the parties. 





ENDNOTES:


FN1: Two of the dozens of examples of negative jokes involving SPAM
submitted by Henson are noted below. 


1) An article from the Austin American-Statesman describing
"Spampers," one of the entries in Spamarama (an annual contest among
cooks where the dishes must include SPAM), which "involved a mother
and her 3-month old baby girl, a diaper pail and a SPAM [pate]."
According to Spamarama's founder, "A lot of the judges became ill."
(Def. Ex. W10, Austin American-Statesman, Mar. 30, 1995, at 61.) 2) An
excerpt from the television cartoon "Duckman," in which Duckman
uncovers "the secret ingredient to SPAM." What the secret ingredient
may be is left to the viewer's imagination as Duckman is shown at
"Murray's Incontinent Camel Farm" observing camels in diapers on a
conveyor belt heading into what is, presumably, the SPAM factory.
(Def. Ex. W5.) 


FN2: As Henson notes, there are three issues before the court: (1) the
use of Spa'am in the motion picture; (2) the use of the Spa'am
likeness on merchandise; (3) the use of the Spa'am name on
merchandise. With respect to the third issue, Henson has stated that
it has shelved its past plans to use the Spa'am name on merchandise,
pending a decision by this court as to their lawfulness. It has
introduced several examples of how it would like to use the Spa'am
name in the future. Hormel has objected to the court's ruling on the
third issue because Henson has stated that it has no current plans to
use the Spa'am name on merchandise, absent court approval. Thus,
Hormel argues, if the court were to reach the issue, it would be
issuing an advisory opinion in violation of the "cases or
controversies" clause of the Constitution. U.S. Const. art III,  2,
cl. 1. Because the alternative to opining now is to place the parties
in the position of reacting hastily to last-minute decisions by
Henson, I believe that the parties' interests are served by the
court's considering the proffered, hypothetical plans. The court's
view will, of course, be dictum. 


FN3: Some consumers may associate Spa'am and/or SPAM with
uncleanliness because of a common perception that pigs have bodies
covered with dirt and enjoy rolling around in mud. Jeffrey Grev,
Hormel's Senior Product Manager, confirms that "the general perception
would be that [pigs] are not clean." (Grev. Dep. at 60.) To the extent
that the public does have such a perception, Henson's portrayal of the
Spa'am character does nothing to reinforce it. 


FN4: I note that Henson's promotional agreements with well- known food
companies, and in particular the fact that Hershey Chocolate plans to
market candies in the shape of Spa'am, cast doubt on Dr. Peracchio's
testimony that association with Spa'am would harm a food product in
particular because consumers will see Spa'am and "[w]e are going to go
'yuck."' (Tr. at 105, 120.) 


FN5: Henson argues that there can be no competition between it and
Hormel because Henson's merchandise is directed primarily at children
while Hormel's merchandise is intended for adults. For example, Hormel
apparel is manufactured only in adult sizes. Hormel responds that it
may expand into children's apparel in the future and that, in any
case, children often wear oversize, adult tee-shirts. Furthermore, it
is not yet clear what merchandise will be licensed in connection with
MupPet Treasure Island. I do not reach this issue because, as
discussed in the text, I find that, with respect to this prong of the
Polaroid-test, the lack of proximity between Hormel's and Henson's
primary products and the strength of each one's separate
identification obviate any likelihood of confusion. 


FN6: Henson states that the "TM" designation is "informal" and
"non-statutory," and that Henson customarily attaches it to its
characters. Henson states that it does not claim trademark rights in
the name Spa'am alone based on its present use. Henson notes that such
a name could theoretically become subject to protection if it achieves
sufficient fame and recognition, but that this result seems unlikely
given the "limited projected future use contemplated by Henson." (Pl.
Ex. 48.) 


FN7: I note that Hormel maintains that the SPA'AM character's conduct
is both illegal and immoral in that Spa'am and his tribe capture
Kermit the Frog and Rizzo Rat and tie them to stakes, and that Rizzo
expresses his fear of being eaten (becoming "table scraps"). Be that
as it may, negative associations resulting from the allegedly
threatening behavior of the Spa'am character are discussed infra, and
are found not to tarnish the SPAM mark, in part because negative
associations are unlikely given Spa'am's childlike qualities and his
subsequent conduct in the motion picture.

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE PROPERTIES, INC.,

                                         95 Civ.
                        Plaintiff,

             - against -

DALLAS COWBOYS FOOTBALL CLUB, LTD.,
TEXAS STADIUM CORPORATION, and JERRAL
W. JONES,

VERIFIED COMPLAINT

Defendants.


         Plaintiff National Football League Properties, Inc.
("NFL Properties"), by its undersigned attorneys, for its com-
plaint herein, alleges upon knowledge as to itself and other-
wise upon information and belief, as follows:

    Nature of the Action

         1.   This action seeks relief against defendants Dal-
las Cowboys Football Club, Ltd., Texas Stadium Corporation and
Jerral W. Jones arising out of violations of the provisions of
the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.  1051, et seq., and the common law.
Among other things, as alleged below, defendants have engaged
in an unlawful plan and scheme, in violation of contractual and
fiduciary obligations, to misappropriate for themselves valu-
able business opportunities and revenues that rightfully belong
to plaintiff NFL Properties.

               Parties. Jurisdiction and Venue


         2.   Plaintiff NFL Properties is a corporation orga-
nized and existing under the laws of the State of California,
with its principal place of business at 410 Park Avenue, New
York, New York.  NFL Properties was created in 1963 to exploit
commercially the various trademark, trade name, and service
mark rights of the NFL and the NFL's member clubs (the "Member
Clubs") for the benefit of all of the Member Clubs.  NFL Prop-
erties is the marketing arm of the NFL.  It is a close corpora-
tion, and its sole shareholders are the Member Clubs, each of
which owns an equal share.

         3.   Defendant Dallas Cowboys Football Club, Ltd.
("Cowboys Partnership") is a limited partnership formed under
the laws of Texas and has its principal place of business in
Irving, Texas.  Cowboys Partnership is a Member Club of the
NFL, and owns and operates the team known as the Dallas Cow-
boys.  Cowboys Partnership is a shareholder of NFL Properties.
Each of the partners of the Cowboys Partnership is either an
individual person who is a citizen of Texas or a corporation
incorporated under the laws of Texas with its principal place
of business in Texas.

         4.   Defendant Texas Stadium Corporation ("Stadium
Corporation") is a Texas corporation with its principal place
of business in Irving, Texas.  Stadium Corporation operates
Texas Stadium, the home playing field of the Dallas Cowboys.

         5.   Defendant Jerral W. Jones ("Jones") is a citizen
of the State of Texas.  Defendant Jones is the sole stockholder
of JWJ Corporation, the sole general partner of defendant Cow-
boys Partnership and controls defendant Cowboys Partnership.
He is also the sole shareholder of, and controls, defendant
Stadium Corporation.  From March 14, 1990 to June 14, 1995,
Jones was a director of plaintiff NFL Properties, at which
later date he resigned as a director in contemplation of con-
tinuing the implementation of the wrongful plan and scheme de-
scribed in this Complaint.

         6.   Jurisdiction over this action is conferred on
this Court pursuant to 15 U.S.C.  1121, 28 U.S.C.  1331,
1332, 1338(a) and (b), and 1367.  The amount in controversy
exceeds $50,000 exclusive of interests and costs.

         7.   Venue in this district is proper under 28 U.S.C.
1391(b).  A substantial part of the events giving rise to the
claims herein occurred in this District.


         The NFL and the Licensing of Club Marks


         8.   The NFL is an unincorporated association of 30
Member Clubs.  Each of the NFL's Member Clubs, including defen-
dant Cowboys Partnership, owns and operates a professional
football team engaged, jointly with other Member Clubs, in pro-
viding entertainment services by playing competitive football
games in various locations throughout the United States.  Each
Member Club has the right to operate an NFL professional foot-
ball team in a designated territory and to play football games
against other teams according to a schedule and terms arranged
by the NFL.

         9.   NFL football has become a highly successful and
lucrative entertainment product.  The phenomenal success and
popularity of NFL football has resulted from the joint efforts
and close cooperation of the Member Clubs.  Particularly impor-
tant to the NFL's success are joint arrangements that provide
for, among other things, revenue sharing and other mechanisms,
including the college draft and free agency rules, that pre-
serve and enhance competitive balance among the teams fielded
by the Member Clubs.  Through such mechanisms and other joint
arrangements among the Member Clubs, NFL football has become a
highly successful product in the entertainment market, and, as
a result of these and other joint activities, the Member Clubs
have come to enjoy tremendous financial success.

         10.  The cornerstone of the NFL system, however, is
revenue sharing.  To produce competitive games, it is essential
that teams be well-matched.  The NFL and its Member Clubs thus
have a strong interest in having strong, viable teams.  Revenue
sharing is critical to achieve this end:  it ensures that all
NFL Member Clubs, not just those in larger or better situated
markets, will have the financial resources to field a competi-
tive team.

         11.  The Dallas Cowboys franchise itself is a case in
point:  revenue sharing has contributed to its present success.
In 1989, when defendant Jones acquired the Cowboys, the team
was unimpressive.  It had suffered through several mediocre
seasons -- missing the playoffs and compiling a losing record.
During Jones' first season as owner (the 1989-90 season), the
Cowboys went 1-15.  Yet the Cowboys shared equally in the na-
tional revenues of the NFL and the profits of NFL Properties,
receiving the same share as that year's Super Bowl champion,
the San Francisco 49ers.  And the Cowboys also benefited
greatly from the integrated group of agreements entered into by
the Member Clubs.  It picked marquee players like Troy Aikman,
Michael Irvin and Emmitt Smith through the draft.  All the
while, Jones received substantial revenue to operate the Cow-
boys through the NFL's various revenue sharing agreements.  The
system allowed Jones to rebuild the Cowboys into a command-
ing NFL team -- one that has now made three straight trips to the
National Football Conference Championship Game and has won two
of the last three Super Bowls.

     12.  One important source of revenue shared by NFL
Member Clubs is that which derives from the various identifying
marks of the NFL's teams.  These identifying marks -- which
include, among other things, team names, nicknames, logos, col-
ors, insignias, helmet designs, uniform designs, and identify-
ing slogans -- are trademarks, trade names or service marks
protected under federal and state law.  These identifying marks
of the various Member Clubs (hereinafter "Club Marks") have
become extremely valuable.  Also of great value are the identi-
fying marks of the NFL itself (hereinafter "NFL Marks"), such
as the NFL shield design, the mark "NFL", and the names "Super
Bowl," "American Football Conference," and "National Football
Conference."  Manufacturers of consumer products and providers
of consumer services today are willing to pay large sums for
the right to use the Club Marks and NFL Marks to promote their
own goods and services.

         13.  The Member Clubs recognized long ago that the
Club Marks and NFL Marks would be more competitive in the mar-
ket place and that their value would be maximized and thus more
effective in promoting the NFL, if they were licensed as a
package.  Accordingly, in 1963, the Member Clubs created plain-
tiff NFL Properties to market the Club Marks and NFL Marks
jointly; from its existence, NFL Properties has conducted ad-
vertising campaigns and promotional ventures on behalf of the
NFL and all of its Member Clubs.  In 1982, NFL Properties'
ability to market the Club Marks was greatly enhanced by a se-
ries of agreements entered into and approved by the Member
Clubs, including the Dallas Cowboys, to facilitate a long-term
unified program of promotional activities involving the Club
Marks and NFL Marks.  Under these agreements (the "Licensing
Agreements"), each Member Club transferred exclusive rights to
its Club Marks to a trust pursuant to a plan whereby the trust
would then exclusively license all such Club Marks to NFL Prop-
erties; NFL Properties became solely responsible for licensing
the Club Marks for commercial use.   (Two of the Member Clubs
have exclusive licensing agreements directly with NFL Proper-
ties for the commercial use of their Club Marks.)  In addition,
NFL Properties would also exploit the NFL Marks in conjunction
with the Club Marks.  The proceeds of NFL Properties' licensing
activities would be shared equally among all Member Clubs, with
some portion to be used for charitable and educational pur-
poses.  The Licensing Agreements have served as a critical com-
ponent of the joint-venture goals of the NFL.

         14.  Thus, pursuant to a trust agreement dated Octo-
ber 1, 1982 (the "Trust Agreement"), a trust called the NFL
Trust was created by the Member Clubs under New York law.  Un-
der the Trust Agreement, the settlors of the NFL Trust agreed
to transfer exclusive rights to use its Club Marks for com-
mercial purposes (with certain limited exceptions not herein
relevant) to the NFL Trust for a period of years.  Thus, for
example, the predecessor entity to the Cowboys Partnership ex-
ecuted Schedule G to the NFL Trust Agreement, which transferred
the exclusive right to use the Dallas Cowboys' Club Marks to
the NFL Trust.  In 1989, upon purchasing the predecessor en-
tity, defendant Cowboys Partnership assumed all of its
predecessor's obligations under the Licensing Agreements.  And
in 1989 as a condition precedent to Jones' purchase of a con-
trolling interest in defendant Cowboys Partnership, he commit-
ted to participating as a shareholder and licensor in NFL Prop-
erties and as a grantor in the NFL Trust.

         15.  The marks thus exclusively licensed to plaintiff
specifically include all trademarks, service marks and trade
names used in connection with the Dallas Cowboys, including
team names, helmet designs, insignia, uniforms, colors, and
identifying slogans (the "Cowboys Club Marks").  Moreover, as
did the other Member Club signatories to the Trust Agreement,
the defendant Cowboys Partnership's predecessor, in settling
the NFL Trust, further expressly covenanted to grant "no
rights, other than those granted in this [Trust] Agreement, to
any party for any commercial uses of Club Marks."  Schedule G
at page 1, Article 3.  Defendant Cowboys Partnership's prede-
cessor expressly acknowledged that it agreed to this restric-
tion because it recognizes the need for and importance of ongoing
promotional endeavors to maintain and enhance the
public image of the NFL and all of its Member
Clubs[,]  [and] further recognizes that the most ef-
fective means of achieving such widespread promo-
tional exposure is through a unified program of pro-
motional activities involving the Marks of the NFL
and all of its Clubs.

         16.  By the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Member
Clubs expressly contemplated and intended that the Club Marks
would be licensed by the NFL Trust to plaintiff NFL Properties:
Article 1.02 of the Trust Agreement specifically required the
NFL Trust to "enter into a long-term exclusive licensing agree-
ment with [NFL Properties] for the purpose of deriving revenues
from" the Club Marks.  Accordingly, simultaneously with its
creation, the NFL Trust entered into a license agreement dated
October 1, 1982 with plaintiff NFL Properties (the "Club Li-
cense Agreement") that provides plaintiff with "the exclusive
right to license the use of the Trust Property on all types of
merchandise and in connection with all types of advertising and
promotional programs."  As are the other Club Marks, the Cow-
boys Club Marks are included in the "Trust Property" licensed
exclusively to plaintiff.  As a result of the Club License
Agreement, individual Member Clubs have retained no right to
license the Club Marks to third parties (with very limited ex-
ceptions, not at issue here).  Plaintiff NFL Properties, in
short, has the exclusive right to license the Club Marks --
including the Club Marks of the Dallas Cowboys -- for com-
mercial use.

         17.  Plaintiff NFL Properties is also the exclusive
licensing agent for the NFL Marks.  The net effect of the Trust
Agreement and the Club License Agreements is to create an ar-
rangement through which the commercial use of the Club Marks
and the NFL Marks is managed in a unified program for the col-
lective benefit of the NFL's Member Clubs as participants in
the NFL joint venture and as equal shareholders of plaintiff
NFL Properties.  Plaintiff thus licenses the Club Marks and the
NFL Marks to third parties for commercial purposes, and pro-
tects the marks from infringement, dilution, disparagement,
misappropriation, and unfair competition.

         18.  Plaintiff NFL Properties has been extremely ac-
tive in promoting the NFL and the Member Clubs.  It has issued
hundreds of licenses for the use of the Club Marks, and Member
Clubs have enjoyed very substantial and increasing royalty in-
come from those licenses.  Plaintiff has also entered into
agreements with various companies involved in particular prod-
uct categories -- such as soft drinks, charge cards, and many
others -- to be exclusive sponsors of the NFL and its Member
Clubs.  Sponsors are granted the right to use the Club Marks
and NFL Marks in advertising, promotion, packaging and point-
of-sale materials, to promote themselves as an "Official Spon-
sor" of the NFL and, in some cases, as an +'Official Sponsor" of
the Member Clubs.  A sponsor is entitled in its enjoyment of
the use of the Club Marks and NFL Marks to the good faith and
cooperation of the NFL and all of its Member Clubs, including
the Dallas Cowboys.  In its most recent fiscal year, 1994,
plaintiff enjoyed a net profit from such activities of some
$100 million.


         19.  The unified promotional program carried out by
NFL Properties serves vital purposes for the Member Clubs and
the NFL.  First, it promotes the joint business of all Member
Clubs in the presentation of professional football entertain-
ment, by distinguishing and elevating professional football
over other entertainment provided in the United States and
elsewhere throughout the world.  Second, it provides efficiency
and quality control in the overall management of the licensing
arrangements for the Club Marks and the NFL Marks.  Third, it
facilitates collaborative efforts to promote the image and
prestige of the NFL in the creation, development, exploitation
and protection of the intellectual property of the NFL Member
Clubs.  Fourth, it ensures that the collective interests of the
NFL Member Clubs in the exploitation of the Club and NFL Marks
-- the value of which is derived from the collective efforts of
the Member Clubs -- are protected and are not subverted by the
short-term interests of a single Member Club.  Fifth, it gener-
ates revenues from the sale of licensing and sponsorship
rights, which is shared equally among the Member Clubs and has
the effect of furthering the NFL's effort to maintain competi-
tive parity.  NFL Properties' joint promotional efforts have
been a tremendous success and have benefited all of the Member
Clubs, including the Dallas Cowboys.

   The Wrongful Plan and Scheme


         20.  At a point in time not known to plaintiff, de-
fendant Jones decided that he was dissatisfied with the rev-
enue-sharing aspects of NFL Properties.  While continuing to
enjoy all of the other benefits of the NFL joint venture, he
determined to embark upon a wrongful plan and scheme to destroy
the structure and operations of NFL Properties in order to gain
for the Cowboys more than an equal share of licensing revenue
and to deny that revenue to the other Member Clubs.  Pursuant
to this wrongful plan and scheme, defendant Jones, along with
the entities he controls, defendants Cowboys Partnership and
Stadium Corporation, have sought and continue to seek to usurp
the revenue generated from licensing and promotion of the NFL
Marks and Cowboys Club Marks, while continuing to share in all
the other benefits of the NFL joint venture and the revenue it
generates.  The scheme has included, and, unless enjoined, will
continue to include, violations of the Lanham Act; breaches of
the Licensing Agreements; breaches of fiduciary duty to the
Dallas Cowboys' co-joint venturers in the NFL; misappropriation
of the property rights of plaintiff; acts that would wrongfully
destroy and interfere with the value of the Cowboys Club Marks,
the rights to which were transferred to the NFL Trust and to
plaintiff; wrongful tortious interference with contractual
rights of others; and sham transactions ostensibly undertaken
in the name of defendant Stadium Corporation (but in reality
transactions with defendant Cowboys Partnership) designed to
circumvent and evade defendant Cowboys Partnership's obliga-
tions to plaintiff.

         21.  Defendant Jones is fully aware that his usurpa-
tion of the licensing revenue generated by the Cowboys Club
Marks that is presently shared among the Member Clubs would be
the end of joint promotion and marketing of the NFL Marks and
Club Marks and, ultimately, for NFL Properties.  Jones under-
stands that, if defendants are permitted to "cherry-pick" among
the benefits and obligations of the NFL and NFL Properties and
to enter into separate deals with competitors of sponsors or
licensees that have contracted with NFL Properties, the entire
collective marketing and revenue-sharing system of NFL Proper-
ties will unravel.

         22.  And that, indeed, is precisely what will occur
if defendant Jones's wrongful plan and scheme is allowed to
continue:  First, the exclusive sponsors and licensees of the
NFL and NFL Properties will be unwilling to pay major consider-
ation for those rights if the rights can be unilaterally under-
mined by the sponsors' competitors obtaining conflicting rights
directly from defendants to exploit the substantial goodwill of
the Dallas Cowboys.  The value of the Club and NFL Marks to NFL
Properties, and thus to the Member Clubs, will greatly dimin-
ish.  Second, other Member Clubs cannot indefinitely sit idly
by and watch defendant Cowboys Partnership alone enjoy, by the
device of separate "side deals," revenues from the exploitation
of the Cowboys Club Marks while at the same time watching their
own revenue stream diminish as the collective rights of NFL
Properties become less valuable.  Inevitably, the Member Clubs
will have no choice but to seek to abandon the system of joint
promotion.  That is, indeed, defendant Jones's specific intent:
to undermine and to destroy the present joint marketing plan
for Club Marks administered by plaintiff.  As blatantly trum-
peted by defendant Jones:  "My legacy in this league is that
I'm going to be the one that unshackles the merchandise sales."
Or, as reported by The Washington Post on Sunday, September 17,
1995 in its story entitled "The Head Cowboy Tries to Ride
Alone," Jones has stated: "I'm bucking the league in a sense
that I know they don't want clubs to individually make market-
ing agreements of the nature that I'm making.  Who is they?
They is me."  (A copy of The Washington Post story is annexed
to this Complaint as Exhibit "A".)

       23.  To carry out his wrongful plan and scheme, de-
fendant Jones has caused and is threatening to continue to
cause defendant Stadium Corporation. to enter into a series of
highly-publicized contractual arrangements that patently vio-
late defendant Cowboys Partnership's contractual and fiduciary
obligations to NFL Properties.  Although nominally with defen-
dant Stadium Corporation, these arrangements in actuality im-
permissibly exploit the Cowboys Club Marks, the Club Marks and
the NFL Marks, and thus wrongfully misappropriate revenue that
belongs to plaintiff and should be shared among all the Member
Clubs.  The use of Stadium Corporation as a stand-in for the
defendant Cowboys Partnership is manifestly a transparent ruse
and subterfuge designed to permit assertion of a supposed claim
that the transactions are not in violation of the contractual
and fiduciary obligations of defendant Cowboys Partnership.
Any such claim would be patently spurious in that, among other
things:

    (a)  Defendant Jones is the sole owner of defendant
Stadium Corporation, is the sole stockholder of
the general partner of defendant Cowboys Part-
nership, and controls both of these defendants.

    (b)  Defendant Jones has made clear that the opera-
tions of Stadium Corporation and the Cowboys
partnership are one and the same:  "[O]ur orga-
nization is the same people who make all the
decisions with the football team and make them
over at the stadium "

    (c)  Texas Stadium is entirely devoted to the Cow-
boys; it is not used for any other sport, or by
any other team; and it is widely known and held
out as the home of the Dallas Cowboys.

    (d)  Defendants' own marketing materials tout an
"identification with . . . Texas Stadium" as
being a "[s]ponsorship with the Dallas Cowboys."
This is indeed the case:  fans do not root for a
stadium.

    (e)  Defendant Jones has publicly announced that
" I really do want anyone to know that if you're
going to market or be a sponsor of the Dallas
Cowboys/Texas Stadium, I want you to come to
Dallas, not to Park Avenue."

    (f)  Defendant Jones has publicly claimed that rev-
enues ostensibly being received by defendant
Stadium Corporation from the wrongful transac-
tions described in this Complaint would be used
by defendant Cowboys Partnership in the signing
of a star player.

    (g)  Defendant Jones has caused each of defendants
Cowboys Partnership and Stadium Corporation to
act in concert with, and to aid and abet each
other in the carrying out of the wrongful plan
and scheme.

         24.  These willful and wrongful activities are inten-
tionally designed to arrogate exclusively for defendants' valu-
able business opportunities and revenues that rightfully belong
to plaintiff NFL Properties, have caused irreparable harm to
NFL Properties, and threaten to unravel the entire NFL Proper-
ties marketing system.  The activities have also caused ir-
reparable harm to consumers by confusing persons who watch NFL
games and support NFL Member Clubs about whether the NFL or
plaintiff has sponsored, approved of, or affiliated themselves
with, the Cowboys' wrongful activities.  And defendant Jones
has made it clear that he intends to enter into other, similar
marketing and promotional deals, which will have the effect of
further injuring NFL Properties and the NFL joint venture.  By
way of example, see Exhibit A annexed hereto ("Jones said Fri-
day [September 15, 1995] he plans to announce two more Stadium
sponsorship deals in 'the next few business days.'").

         Soft Drink Sponsorship

         25.  The soft-drink product category is one of the
major sponsorship categories available to NFL football and
other professional sports.  Pursuant to a five-year exclusive
licensing and sponsorship agreement with plaintiff dated Febru-
ary 26, 1993, the Coca-Cola Company ("Coca-Cola"), in return
for many millions of dollars in payments, is entitled to the
exclusive right to use the NFL Marks and Club Marks in connec-
tion with the marketing of soft drinks.  The intent of the
agreement is that Coca-Cola soft drinks, and only Coca-Cola
soft drinks, are entitled to be promoted in association with
the NFL and its Member Clubs.

         26.  Defendants have full knowledge of the existence
and terms of plaintiff's licensing and sponsorship agreement
with Coca-Cola, and have acted in intentional and flagrant
derogation of that agreement and of the Licensing Agreements.

        The Dr. Pepper Transaction

         27.  In furtherance of the wrongful plan and scheme,
in or about the Summer of 1995, defendant Jones, ostensibly
acting through defendant Stadium Corporation, solicited a
transaction with Dr. Pepper/Seven-Up Companies, Inc.  ("Dr. Pep-
per") for "pouring rights" for Dr. Pepper soft drinks at Texas
Stadium.  This transaction was solicited by wrongful use of NFL
Marks and Cowboys Club Marks, wrongfully held out to Dr. Pepper
the benefits to be achieved by it from identification and uti-
lization of such marks and the goodwill associated with the NFL
and the Cowboys, and was in violation of the Licensing Agree-
ments and in derogation of plaintiff's exclusive licensing and
sponsorship agreement with Coca-Cola.

         28.  As owner of Texas Stadium, defendant Stadium
Corporation is entitled to select a soft-drink vendor or ven-
dors of its choice to sell soft drinks at stadium events.  The
arrangement contemplated between defendants and Dr. Pepper was,
however, in no way limited to a simple grant of stadium "pour-
ing rights."  Thus, the proposal to Dr. Pepper was to enter
into a "Dallas Cowboys and Dr. Pepper Joint Venture+; to afford
Dr. Pepper a "[s]ponsorship with the Dallas Cowboys through an
identification with the most visible real estate property in
Texas, Texas Stadium."  Such proposed transaction was blatantly
in violation of the Licensing Agreements, whereby defendant
Cowboys Partnership transferred to the Trust, which in turn
licensed to plaintiff, the exclusive right to enter into spon-
sorship agreements with respect to the Dallas Cowboys.  Such
proposed transaction likewise constituted a blatant and wrong-
ful interference with the contractual arrangements between
plaintiff and Coca-Cola whereby Coca-Cola is designated the
exclusive sponsor of the NFL and has the exclusive right to use
the Club Marks with respect to the soft-drink category.

        29.  Further, in wrongfully soliciting Dr. Pepper to
enter into such a +sponsorship" arrangement "with the Dallas
Cowboys," defendants made wrongful use of the Cowboys Club
Marks -- including the Cowboys "Star" logo -- and the NFL Marks
-- including the NFL's "Shield" logo.  Defendants had no right
to make any use of these marks for any such purpose.

         30.  In or about September 1995, upon information and
belief, in response to the proposal, Dr. Pepper in fact entered
into an agreement for the relationship that had been proposed
and described to it by defendants.

         The Pepsi Transaction

         31.  In addition, in furtherance of the wrongful plan
and scheme, in or about August 1995, defendants entered into an
agreement with PepsiCo, Inc.  ("Pepsi"), Coca-Cola's arch rival,
that once again was designed to and does wrongfully exploit the
goodwill of the Dallas Cowboys, the Cowboys Club Marks and the
NFL Marks in violation of the Licensing Agreements and the
rights of Coca-Cola pursuant to its exclusive licensing and
sponsorship agreement with plaintiff.  Once again, although
ostensibly a contractual arrangement with defendant Stadium
Corporation, in actuality the agreement wrongfully granted to
Pepsi sponsorship rights with respect to the Dallas Cowboys and
was designed to permit Pepsi to hold itself out and to be un-
derstood to be the "official cola" of the Dallas Cowboys.
Thus, among other things:

    (a)  Pepsi received the right to market itself as the
"official cola" of "Texas Stadium, home of the
Dallas Cowboys";

    +b)  An executive of defendant Cowboys Partnership
set forth for the press:  "Coke is out of Texas
Stadium.  They have been given the boot";

    (c)  Defendant Jones announced-

  "Our organization is the same people who
  make all the decisions with the football
  team and make them over at the stadium.  So
  what is being said in a way that everybody
  knows is that we sell Pepsi, we Promote
  Pepsi, and we drink Pepsi, in this entire
  organization -- the Cowboys, the stadium.
  everybody" (emphasis added); and

    (d)  At a press conference on August 3, 1995 announc-
ing the Pepsi transaction, defendant Jones as-
sociated in his dress a shirt emblazoned with a
Cowboys Club Mark and boots emblazoned with a
Pepsi logo and flamboyantly posed for the press,
as reflected in a picture in The New York Times.

     32.  Defendants fully understood and intended that
their conduct in entering into the Pepsi transaction was viola-
tive of the rights of plaintiff, and in derogation of the en-
tire NFL Properties' marketing plan.  Defendant Jones publicly
stated that:

    (a)  the transaction was "all about challenging the
status quo" and was an act that "hits [plaintiff
NFL] Properties and Coca-Cola right on the
nose";

    (b)  it was his intention that "ultimately all logos,
the helmet and star associated with the Cowboys
will be handled by the Dallas Cowboys and not
the marketing arm of the NFL [i.e., plaintiff
NFL Properties]"; and

    (c)  "I really do want anyone to know that if you're
going to market or be a sponsor of the Dallas
Cowboys/Texas Stadium, I want YOU to come to
Dallas. not to Park Avenue [the offices of NFL
Properties]."

            Apparel Sponsorships --

            The NIKE Transaction

         33.  The authentic sports apparel category is like-
wise one of major significance in arrangements for NFL sponsor-
ship rights.  In particular, plaintiff NFL Properties has
granted a number of licenses called "PRO LINE" licenses, which
afford licensees exclusive rights to sell apparel and equipment
bearing the Club Marks and the NFL Marks.  Another aspect of
the PRO LINE licenses is the payment by the licensee of a tele-
vision exposure fee.  NFL Member Club players, coaches and
other club personnel are called upon to wear items bearing the
insignia of a particular PRO LINE licensee, which is then cap-
tured by television cameras during the course of games, which
are watched by millions of television viewers.  Defendants are
fully aware of the existence and terms of plaintiff's contrac-
tual agreements with its PRO LINE licensees.

         34.  NIKE, Inc. ("NIKE") is a competitor of
plaintiff's PRO LINE licensees.  Although NIKE is itself a PRO
LINE licensee as to certain products (footwear, gloves and
socks), it is not a PRO LINE licensee as to major items of ap-
parel, for example, headwear, shirts and jackets.  In further-
ance of the wrongful plan and scheme, in or about late August
or early September 1995, defendants entered into an agreement
with NIKE, which was in violation of defendant Cowboys
Partnership's contractual, trust, and licensing obligations,
and the contractual relationships that exist between plaintiff
and competing PRO LINE licensees.

         35.  Once again, defendants purported to act through
the device of an agreement nominally entered into by Stadium
Corporation.  And once again, this was a transparent subter-
fuge:  in truth and in fact, it was a blatant violation of the
contractual and fiduciary obligations of defendant Cowboys
Partnership in that the agreement was intended to, and does,
operate to create an association between NIKE and the Dallas
Cowboys.  In addition, defendants have affirmatively and wrong-
fully acted to disassociate the Cowboys from plaintiff's autho-
rized PRO LINE licensees, and have in bad faith taken actions
to deprive such authorized "PRO LINE" licensees of the benefits
of their rights.

         36.  By way of example:

    (a)  The announcement of the NIKE transaction was
carefully orchestrated to maximize public expo-
sure of a new relationship between NIKE and the
Cowboys, quite apart from anything having to do
with Texas Stadium.

    (b)  The transaction was announced on September 4,
1995, by a press release issued not at Texas
Stadium but at the New Jersey Meadowlands, the
site of the Cowboys' Monday night opening game
for the 1995-96 season, and thus an occasion
guaranteed to capture the large prime-time tele-
vision audience that watched the first regular
season Monday Night Football and to gain ex-
traordinary media exposure.

    (c)  The press release was issued jointly by NIKE and
the Dallas Cowboys and was headlined:  "COWBOYS
OWNER BUCKS NFL AGAIN."

    (d)  The joint press release quoted the Chief Execu-
tive Officer of NIKE as setting forth:

  "This agreement with the Dallas Cowboys
  allows us the opportunity to pursue our
  desire to be associated with one of the
  most popular football teams in America
  while we continue our efforts to work with
  NFL Properties in an official capacity"
  (emphasis added).

    (e)  During the game at the Meadowlands (upon infor-
mation and belief, by defendant Jones' express
order), none of the Cowboys' players, coaches or
other sideline personnel dressed in the apparel
of PRO LINE licensees, including, for the first
half of the game, personnel who had authorized
individual contractual commitments to wear ap-
parel items bearing the logos of such licensees;
and throughout the entirety of the game, the
defendants wrongfully caused to be removed from
Cowboys players' helmets the insignia of
plaintiff's PRO LINE helmet licensee, Riddell,
Inc.

    (f)  During that game, defendant Jones personally
escorted to the Cowboys sideline the NIKE Chief
Executive Officer (Phil Knight), another NIKE
executive, and Monica Seles, the famous profes-
sional tennis player who is a paid NIKE pro-
moter.  Defendant Jones and his companions all
prominently wore NIKE-branded merchandise.

    (g)  The actions of defendants drew intense public
attention to the Cowboys' relationship with NIKE
to the exclusion of Reebok International, Ltd.,
the PRO LINE Licensee of the New York Giants.
Millions of television viewers observed no ap-
parel brand other than NIKE, which diminished
and interfered with Reebok's enjoyment of the
benefits of its PRO LINE license, and damaged
NFL Properties' relationship with Reebok.

    (h)  Thereafter, defendants purposely took further
wrongful and highly publicized actions to ensure
that the public understood that the Cowboys were
affiliating themselves with NIKE as a sponsor --
in derogation of the rights of plaintiff's PRO
LINE licensees.  Thus, at the Cowboys' first
home game of the 1995-96 season, a 30-foot-long
NIKE logo was hung over midfield, to be caught
prominently by the television cameras; and NIKE
logos festooned the stadium portals and were
otherwise ubiquitously in view.

         37.  All of the foregoing conduct constituted blatant
violations of the rights of plaintiff NFL Properties, as well
as violations of contractual and fiduciary obligations of de-
fendants, and of contractual rights of licensees of plaintiff.
In particular, defendants' conduct constituted a blatantly im-
permissible exploitation of the good will of the Dallas Cow-
boys, the Cowboys Club Marks, and the NFL Marks in violation of
the Licensing Agreements and the rights of plaintiff and its
official PRO LINE licensees.

             Other Threatened Wrongful Conduct

  ~      38.  In furtherance of defendant Jones' wrongful plan
and scheme, defendants threaten to engage in additional conduct
in derogation of the rights of NFL Properties, and official NFL
Properties sponsors and licensees.  Upon information and be-
lief, defendants have made other proposals for similar con-
tracts with other companies competing with NFL Properties lic-
ensees.  These proposals, which upon information and belief
make extensive use of NFL Marks and internal NFL Properties
marketing information (without NFL Properties' permission) and
seek to exploit the value and success of the NFL as a whole,
offer advertising and promotional rights that go significantly
beyond the limited licensing rights that the Member Clubs re-
tain under the Trust Agreement.  Upon information and belief,
for example, defendants are negotiating an agreement with
American Express that would make American Express the official
charge card of "Texas Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys."
Such an agreement, as defendants well know, would constitute a
manifest violation of the rights of VISA, which is the official
charge card of the NFL pursuant to a license granted by plain-
tiff NFL Properties earlier in 1995, and would thus constitute
a manifest violation of the rights of plaintiff.  And, on Sep-
tember 17, 1995, it was reported in The Washington Post that
defendant Jones intended to announce two more stadium sponsor-
ship deals in the "'next few business days. (Exhibit A an-
nexed hereto.)  Unless restrained, it is clear that defendants'
wrongful conduct will continue.


            Injury to NFL Properties and the Public

         39.  Defendants' violation of their contractual and
fiduciary obligations to the plaintiff and its exclusive rights
in the Club Marks injures and, unless restrained, will continue
to injure plaintiff NFL Properties in several ways.  Among
other things, defendants' wrongful conduct:  (1)  usurps and
undermines licensing opportunities that would otherwise be
available to plaintiff for the benefit of the NFL Member Clubs;
(2) interferes with plaintiff's ability to conduct a league-
wide unified national licensing and promotional program utiliz-
ing NFL Marks and the Club Marks in order to present to the
public the image and the reality of a national sports enter-
tainment entity; (3) interferes with plaintiff's established
relationships with licensees, threatening the goodwill plain-
tiff holds in those relationships; (4) threatens plaintiff's
ability to ensure that licensed products are of a consistent
high quality that will enhance the public image of the NFL and
its Member Clubs; and (5) jeopardizes and tarnishes the value
of plaintiff's right to use the Club Marks and NFL Marks.  Un-
less restrained, defendants+ continuing wrongful conduct will
continue to cause these harms.

         40.  Thus, as a result of defendants' wrongful plan
and scheme, existing sponsors and licensees of plaintiff NFL
Properties have complained and may want rebates on their li-
censing fees or want to cancel their contracts altogether.
Sponsors and licensees who are in process of renewing their
licenses will choose not to do so.  And future sponsors and
licensees will decide to seek other means of promotion and ad-
vertising.

         41.  Beyond this, members of the public who watch NFL
games on television and in person will be deceived, confused,
misled and defrauded by defendants' activities, which are cre-
ating the false impression that products wrongfully promoted by
defendants in derogation of the rights of plaintiff NFL Proper-
ties and its licensees and sponsors are sponsored, approved or
authorized by not only the Cowboys, but also by the NFL and the
plaintiff.

         42.  Plaintiff NFL Properties has suffered and will
continue to suffer substantial injury as a result of defen-
dants' unlawful conduct, resulting in damages that are not
presently known but are believed to be in excess of $100 mil-
lion.

         43.  Defendants' tortious conduct, breach of fidu-
ciary duty and breaches of contract have been intentional and
deliberate, malicious, wanton, reckless and in deliberate dis-
regard of the rights of others.  This misconduct has been egre-
gious, has involved a high degree of moral culpability, moral
turpitude and wanton dishonesty, and has been aimed at plain-
tiff and at the public generally.

         44.  The injuries that will be suffered by plaintiff
NFL Properties as a result of the continuation of defendants'
unlawful conduct are substantial, not fully compensable in mon-
etary damages and irreparable.  These injuries will be dif-
ficult to ascertain and calculate in monetary terms.  Unless
defendants are restrained, the injuries caused by defendants
wrongful conduct will continue.

             COUNT I

           (Lanham Act)

         45.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations
of paragraphs 1 through 44 of the Complaint as if fully set
forth herein.

         46 . As alleged above, by virtue of the License
Agreements, defendants have no right whatsoever to license the
Cowboys Club Marks and the NFL Marks for commercial use by
third parties; those rights belong exclusively to plaintiff.

         47.  By making Dr. Pepper a soft-drink sponsor of
Texas Stadium, "the home of the Dallas Cowboys," and by procur-
ing such sponsorship in the manner set forth above, defendants
have caused and are likely to cause a likelihood of confusion,
mistake and deception as to the affiliation, connection or as-
sociation of sponsorship, licensing, endorsement or other ap-
proval by the Dallas Cowboys or the NFL of Dr. Pepper products,
promotions and advertising, in violation of Section 43(a) of
the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.  1125(a).

         48.  By making Pepsi a soft-drink sponsor of Texas
Stadium, "the home of the Dallas Cowboys," and by procuring and
promoting such sponsorship in the manner set forth above, de-
fendants have caused and are likely to cause a likelihood of
confusion, mistake and deception as to the affiliation, connec-
tion or association of sponsorship, licensing, endorsement or
other approval by the Dallas Cowboys or the NFL of Pepsi prod-
ucts, promotions and advertising, in violation of Section 43(a)
of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.  1125(a).

         49.  In authorizing NIKE branded apparel to be worn
on the field and on the sidelines during televised NFL games,
and in promoting and advertising such authorization, defendants
have caused and are likely to cause a likelihood of confusion,
mistake and deception as to the affiliation, connection or as-
sociation of sponsorship, licensing, endorsement or other ap-
proval by the Dallas Cowboys or the NFL of NIKE apparel prod-
ucts, promotions and advertising, in violation of Section 43(a)
of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.  1125(a).

       50.  Defendants have created the false and misleading
commercial impression that NIKE has been licensed or otherwise
authorized to use the Cowboys Club Marks, the Club Marks and
the NFL Marks for merchandising and promotion of NIKE apparel
products or is otherwise affiliated, connected or associated
with the Dallas Cowboys or the NFL in violation of Section
43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.  1125(a).

         51.  Defendants are threatening to enter into ad-
ditional arrangements with other competitors of plaintiff's
licensees.  Defendants' activities are causing irreparable harm
to plaintiff, and, unless restrained, will continue to cause
irreparable harm to plaintiff.  Plaintiff has no adequate rem-
edy at law.


                    COUNT II

      (Breach of Express Provisions of Contract)


         52.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations
of paragraphs 1 through 44 of the Complaint as if fully set
forth herein.

         53.  Pursuant to the Trust Agreement and the Club
License Agreement, defendant Cowboys Partnership has licensed
the exclusive rights to use all Cowboy Club Marks to NFL Prop-
erties and has expressly agreed to grant no such rights to any
other party for any commercial use of the Cowboy Club Marks.
In particular, the License Agreements provide that all present
or future +'identifying slogans" constitute Cowboys Club Marks:
this includes "Texas Stadium, the Home of the Dallas Cowboys."
Defendants are thus contractually obligated to refrain from
commercially exploiting the "Texas Stadium" mark.  In addition,
as set forth above, defendants' sponsorship agreements ostensi-
bly involving Texas Stadium are in actuality prohibited spon-
sorship agreements for the Dallas Cowboys.

         54.  By entering into and implementing the above-
described agreements with NIKE, Pepsi and Dr. Pepper, defendant
Cowboys Partnership has accordingly breached express provisions
of the Licensing Agreements.

         55.  Defendants have acted, and are continuing to
act, in concert to breach the contractual obligations of defen-
dant Cowboys Partnership  pursuant to the Licensing Agreements.

         56.  Defendants are threatening to enter into ad-
ditional arrangements with other competitors of plaintiff's
licensees.  Defendants' activities are causing irreparable harm
to plaintiff, and, unless restrained, will continue to cause
irreparable harm to plaintiff.  Plaintiff has no adequate rem-
edy at law.


                           COUNT III

                (Breach of Implied Covenant of Good

                   Faith Dealing in Contract)


         57.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations
of paragraphs 1 through 44 of the Complaint as if fully set
forth herein.

         58.  Inherent in the Licensing Agreements, as in all
agreements, is an implied covenant of good-faith dealing.  By
entering into the agreements with NIKE, Pepsi and Dr. Pepper
described above, by engaging in the subterfuge that the con-
tracts in fact involve rights as to "Texas Stadium," and by
taking the other actions set forth above, defendant Cowboys
Partnership has been acting, and is threatening to continue to
act, in breach of that implied covenant of good-faith dealing
and is openly seeking to destroy the value of the licenses
transferred and the entire marketing plan contemplated and cre-
ated by the Licensing Agreements.

         59.  Defendants have acted, and are continuing to
act, in concert to breach the contractual obligations of defen-
dant Cowboys Partnership  pursuant to the Licensing Agreements.

         60.  Defendants are threatening to enter into ad-
ditional arrangements with other competitors of plaintiff's
licensees.  Defendants+ activities are causing irreparable harm
to plaintiff, and, unless restrained, will continue to cause
irreparable harm to plaintiff.  Plaintiff has no adequate rem-
edy at law.

                   COUNT IV

        (Breach of Obligations As Settlor

         of the NFL Trust Agreement and as

         Licensor of the Cowboys Club Marks)


         61.  Plaintiff reasserts and realleges the allega-
tions of paragraphs 1 through 44 of the Complaint as if fully
set forth herein.

         62.  Defendant Cowboys Partnership as a settlor of
the NFL Trust and owner of the trademarks,-trade names and ser-
vice marks that have been licensed by the NFL Trust exclusively
to plaintiff NFL Properties is obligated to refrain from taking
any steps that will reduce the value of the marks transferred
to the Trust.

         63.  By engaging in the wrongful plan and scheme de-
scribed above, and by threatening to continue the wrongful plan
and scheme, defendant Cowboys Partnership has been acting, and,
unless restrained, will continue to act, to undermine the value
of the NFL Trust licenses and property and to interfere with
plaintiff's rights in such licenses and property.

         64.  Defendants have acted, and are continuing to
act, in concert to undermine the value of the NFL Trust li-
censes and property in violation of the Cowboys Partnership's
obligations as a Settlor of the NFL Trust and as licensor of
the Cowboys Club Marks.

         65.  Defendants are threatening to enter into ad-
ditional arrangements with other competitors of plaintiff's
licensees.  Defendants' activities are causing irreparable harm
to plaintiff, and, unless restrained, will continue to cause
irreparable harm to plaintiff.  Plaintiff has no adequate rem-
edy at law.


                      COUNT V

            (Breach of Fiduciary Duty)


         66.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations
of paragraphs 1 through 44 of the Complaint as if fully set
forth herein.

         67.  Defendant Cowboys Partnership, as a Member Club
of and joint venturer in the NFL, and as a shareholder in
plaintiff close corporation, has fiduciary duties to act with
undivided loyalty to the joint venture of which, pursuant to
the Licensing Agreements, plaintiff is the marketing arm; to
act in the highest good faith and to deal fairly with the other
Member Clubs; and, to refrain from usurping business opportuni-
ties from plaintiff.  Defendant Jones, as a director of plain-
tiff, had a fiduciary duty to act in the highest good faith and
to deal fairly with plaintiff and the Member Club shareholders
of plaintiffs and to refrain from usurping business opportuni-
ties from plaintiff.

         68.  Through the wrongful plan and scheme described
above, which commenced while defendant Jones was still a direc-
tor of plaintiff, and by threatening to continue the wrongful
plan and scheme, defendants Cowboys Partnership and Jones have
violated and threaten to continue to violate, their fiduciary
obligations, as aforesaid.

         69.  Defendants have acted, and are continuing to
act, in concert to violate defendants Cowboys Partnership's and
Jones' fiduciary obligations, as aforesaid.

         70.  Defendants are threatening to enter into ad-
ditional arrangements with other competitors of plaintiff's
licensees.  Defendants' activities are causing irreparable harm
to plaintiff, and, unless restrained, will continue to cause
irreparable harm to plaintiff.  Plaintiff has no adequate rem-
edy at law.

                   COUNT VI

             (Unjust Enrichment)


         71.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations
of paragraphs 1 through 44 of the Complaint as if fully set
forth herein.

         72.  Defendants' conduct, directly or through an af-
filiate, in marketing and licensing rights to Cowboys Club
Marks to which plaintiff has been granted exclusive rights pur-
suant to the Licensing Agreements, constitutes unjust enri-
chment to defendants.  Defendants, having benefited from
plaintiff's activities and revenue sharing when the Cowboys
were weak, now seek to "cherry pick" those aspects of the
plaintiff's arrangements, as well as those aspects of the NFL
joint venture arrangements they deem to their advantage, while
rejecting those they deem onerous.  Defendants by means of
their wrongful side deals seek to usurp for themselves more
than their rightful share of licensing and sponsorship revenue
from commercial exploitation of the Club Marks and the NFL
Marks.

         73.  Defendants are threatening to enter into ad-
ditional arrangements with competitors of plaintiff's licens-
ees.  Defendants' activities are causing irreparable harm to
plaintiff, and, unless restrained, will continue to cause ir-
reparable harm to plaintiff.  Plaintiff has no adequate remedy
at law.

                      COUNT VII

            (Misappropriation of Property)


         74.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations
of paragraphs 1 through 44 of the Complaint as if fully set
forth herein.

         75.  Defendants' conduct, as aforesaid, constitutes
misappropriation of property rights belonging to plaintiff.
Defendants by means of their wrongful side deals seek to usurp
for themselves more than their share of licensing and sponsor-
ship revenue from commercial exploitation of the Club Marks and
the NFL Marks.

         76.  Defendants are threatening to enter into ad-
ditional arrangements with other competitors of plaintiff's
licensees.  Defendants' activities are causing irreparable harm
to plaintiff, and, unless restrained, will continue to cause
irreparable harm to plaintiff.  Plaintiff has no adequate rem-
edy at law.

                  COUNT VIII

           (Tortious Interference)


         77.  Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations
of paragraphs 1 through 44 of the Complaint as if fully set
forth herein.


         78.  Defendants' wrongful plan and scheme has inter-
fered with and caused the violation and derogation of contrac-
tual rights granted by plaintiff to its licensees and sponsors.
Defendants knew of the existence and terms of such contractual
rights and have acted purposely, and are threatening to con-
tinue to act purposely, to interfere with and violate such con-
tractual rights.

         79.  Defendants have acted, and are continuing to
act, in concert to interfere with and to violate the contrac-
tual rights of plaintiff's licensees and sponsors.

         80.  Defendants are threatening to enter into ad-
ditional arrangements with other competitors of plaintiff's
licensees.  Defendants' activities are causing irreparable harm
to plaintiff, and, unless restrained, will continue to cause
irreparable harm to plaintiff.  Plaintiff has no adequate rem-
edy at law.

                  Count IX

            (Declaratory Judgment)


         81.  Defendants maintain that they are entitled to
enter into and to continue to enter into contracts that in ef-
fect afford sponsorship rights for the Dallas Cowboys and
rights to the Cowboys Club Marks, provided that they cause the
contracts nominally to be entered into with defendant Stadium
Corporation.  Plaintiff contests this position.  It is the po-
sition of plaintiff that contracts of the nature entered into
by defendants, as described herein, and acts taken by defen-
dants pursuant thereto:  violate the Lanham Act, the contrac-
tual obligations under the Licensing Agreements entered into by
defendant Cowboys Partnership; wrongfully undermine the license
rights transferred by defendant Cowboys Partnership as settlor
of the NFL Trust; are in breach of the fiduciary obligations
defendants owe to plaintiff; unjustly enrich defendants; and
constitute tortious interference with the contractual relation-
ships between plaintiff and its authorized licensees and spon-
sors.  As alleged above, all defendants have been acting in
concert in furtherance of the wrongful plan and scheme.

         82.  A declaratory judgment is necessary here to es-
tablish the rights of the parties:  that defendants are not
entitled to enter into agreements of the nature described
above; that defendants may not, through their wrongful actions,
render the sponsorship and licensing rights of plaintiff's
sponsors and prospective sponsors nugatory; that the contrac-
tual rights of plaintiff and Member Clubs of the NFL will be
honored; that moneys and other benefits will not be improperly
diverted to defendants; and that the other Member Clubs are
entitled to receive their appropriate share of proceeds from
the marketing of the Club Marks and the NFL Marks.  Absent a
declaration from this Court, the uncertainty as to plaintiff's
rights caused by defendants' wrongful and continuing plan and
scheme will continue, to the injury of plaintiff.


       Prayer for Relief

quests that the Court enter judgment for plaintiff:

breach of defendants' fiduciary obligations.

<P>Jeffrey Dahmer, the serial killer who ate his victims, was beaten to death in prison last November. His body has been in storage and his family has been fighting over what to do with his brain. Dahmer asked for his remains to be cremated and his father wants that request fulfilled. But his mother wants his brain preserved for medical research.</P>

TRANSCRIPT OF PROCEEDINGS

(11:10 a.m.  Mr. Dahmer via speaker phone.)

      THE COURT:  All right.  This is in the
matter of the Estate of Jeffrey L. Dahmer.
It's Case Number 94-PR-175.  Appearing here today
on a motion is Attorney Robert Fennig, is that
correct?

      MR. FENNIG:  That's correct.

      THE COURT:  And you are appearing on behalf
of Mr. Dahmer's mother --

       MR. FENNIG:  Joyce Flint.

       THE COURT:  -- Joyce Flint.
And telephonically we have the father of
Jeffrey Dahmer appearing personally.  Your name is
Lionel Dahmer, correct?

       MR. DAHMER:  Correct.

       THE COURT:  And are you there with an
attorney, or are you on your own?

       MR. DAHMER:  I am on my own.

       THE COURT:  Okay.

       Any other appearances on behalf of any other
party?  Appears to be no other interested parties
present in the courtroom.

       We have a motion brought on by Mr. Fennig on
behalf of Ms. Flint to have Jeffrey Dahmer's
brain, as I understand it, turned over for
purposes of scientific research.  And based on
correspondence that I have received from Lionel
Dahmer, that is opposed by him.

       Is that correct, Mr. Dahmer?

       MR. DAHMER:  That is correct, Judge.

       THE COURT:  Okay.  Mr. Fennig, before we
went on the record here today I provided you with
copies of the correspondence that the Court had
received from Lionel Dahmer.  Although they had
been received some days ago, I had not had an
opportunity to see them until today, having been
out of the office for the last week.

       Have you had an opportunity to review them?

       MR. FENNIG:  I have looked at them in the
short time that I've been here.  And I didn't get
any of these sent to my office either, so this
came as a -- no surprise, but it -- I didn't get
any other notice that there would be opposition to
the motion.

       THE COURT:  Okay.

       MR. FENNIG:  If I may?

       THE COURT:  Hang on just a moment.

       Mr. Dahmer, I want to touch base with you
momentarily.  Are you hearing Mr. Fennig?

       MR. DAHMER:  Barely.  I can pick up a little
bit of what he's saying.  I think he said that he
did not receive any correspondence.  Of course,
I've been at a business meeting, and I have sent
you two pieces of information, faxes, on September
8th and October 1st.

       THE COURT:  Okay.  The -- those have been
received by the Court.  But like I indicated, I
didn't read them until today and they were
provided to Mr. Fennig today.

       Mr. Fennig, are you prepared to go forward
on your motion?

       MR. FENNIG:  Yes.  Would it accommodate
Mr. Dahmer, if I got closer to the bar?

       THE COURT:  It may help to some degree.
That's a fairly good microphone system, but it's
not perfect obviously.

       (Mr. Fennig approaches Bench)

       MR. FENNIG:  Mr. Dahmer, tell me if you can
hear me better now.

       MR. DAHMER:  That's better.

       THE COURT:  Okay.  Go ahead then.

       MR. DAHMER:  Not perfect, but better.

       MR. FENNIG:  Well, we'll use what we have.

       This motion, as the papers indicate, is
brought by Joyce Flint, the natural mother of the
decedent in this matter.

       After the autopsy there remained brain and
other tissue that was kept under the care and
supervision of Dr. Robert W. Huntington at the
University of Wisconsin Medical School.  And he
had these tissues under lock and key in one of the
University Hospitals in Madison.

       Attempts were made to contact him by my
client back in June with the thought of submitting
this tissue for scientific study.  It was
indicated by Dr. Huntington that he would not
release the tissue unless there was some
authoritative decision made in that regard.

       Mrs. Flint had been trying to contact     
Mr. Dahmer by telephone, and she used other
parties to attempt to contact him.  She never got
a response by any of her phone calls.  Now from
what I have read from Mr. Dahmer, he denies
getting any phone calls.

       MR. DAHMER:  That's not true.

       THE COURT:  Okay.

       MR. FENNIG:  Would you let me finish,
Mr. Dahmer?

       MR. DAHMER:  I didn't know that I wasn't
supposed to respond in kind during the speaking.

       THE COURT:  Okay.  Let me explain how we
will run the procedure here today.

       First of all, Mr. Fennig is going to be
allowed to present his argument.  Then, Mr.
Dahmer, I will hear from you before rendering
any kind of decision.  Because Mr. Fennig is the
moving party, he will then have a final rebuttal
opportunity after you have spoken.

       MR. DAHMER:  Okay, that's fine.

       THE COURT:  If you can keep your comments
until I address you, and then I will hear your
argument in total.

       MR. DAHMER:  The only problem I have is
remembering -- if it gets too long -- remembering
where I was going to respond.

       THE COURT:  Okay.

       MR. DAHMER:  Okay.

       MR. FENNIG:  I'll keep it quite brief.
The -- based on nonresponses from Mr. Dahmer
to Ms. Flint, it was suggested by contacting my
office and I represented her back in November
immediately after the situation at the -- at the
jail.  And I advised her that I would call
Dr. Huntington and find out what it took to see to
it that there may be a possibility of this
occurring and under what circumstances
Dr. Huntington would agree to it.

       I was then made aware that Mrs. Flint had
contacted the Georgetown University Medical
Center, and this was made by reference from some
folks out in California.  And Dr. Pincus has a
widely known reputation in pathological
neurological study.

       I was -- I was advised that Dr. Pincus had
grant money to take care of the transportation and
the research at hand.

       I wrote to Dr. Huntington about this, and he
said he would accept that if I could get a Court
order with respect to that.  I -- when I was here
on the September 6th motion that was brought by
all the claimants in the estate, I then secured a
court date for this motion and mailed it to all
the interested parties as shown on my certificate
of mailing.  That was sent out, I believe, on the
12th.  And Mr. Dahmer -- Mr. Dahmer got that, by
acknowledgment in his letter, on the 18th.
I contacted Dr. Huntington and advised him
what Dr. Pincus was available -- I mean Dr. Pincus
was available to accept this tissue.  I contacted
Dr. Huntington who asked me for authority from
Dr. Pincus.  Dr. Pincus give gave me a fax which I
am showing to the Court now.

       THE COURT:  Let's have it marked as an
exhibit.

       MR. FENNIG:  And it's, I believe, short
enough to read.

       (Exhibit marked)

       THE COURT:  Are there any other exhibits
contemplated?

       MR. FENNIG:  Just one more.

       THE COURT:  Have it marked.

       (Exhibit marked)

       THE COURT:  Okay.  The first exhibit, for
your benefit, Mr. Dahmer, is on letterhead from
the Georgetown University Medical Center and bears
the signature of Dr. -- I'm assuming doctor?  Yes.

       MR. FENNIG:  Pincus.

       THE COURT:  There it is, Jonathan Pincus.

       "I am grateful for this opportunity to study
the brain of Jeffrey Daumer (sic).  It represents
an unparalleled chance to possibly determine what
neurological factors could have contributed to his
bizarre criminal behavior.

      "We will be glad to examine the brain tissue
microscopically at Georgetown University.  My
grant will guarantee payment for the safe
transportation of the brain in formaldehyde to my
office at Georgetown University School of
Medicine in Washington D.C."

      That's the extent of that exhibit.  Go on,
Mr. Fennig.

      MR. FENNIG:  Well, in answer, after I
transmitted that fax of that letter to
Dr. Huntington, he called me.  We had a
conversation, and I requested something in writing
from his office with respect do Dr. Pincus' offer.
And that is Exhibit 2.  And that I believe is
short enough to read, as well.  If you would?

      THE COURT:  Exhibit Number 2 has been given
to the Court.  It is on University of Wisconsin
Madison Medical School letterhead, bears the
signature of Robert Huntington who is identified
as an associate professor and who did the
post-mortem.  It reads as follows:

      "Dear Attorney Fennig, Thank you for
forwarding the letter for Dr. Pincus.  My original
thought was to have the brain carefully studied at
McLean Hospital in Boston.  I am not acquainted
with Dr. Pincus and his studies.

      "The brain of Mr. Dahmer is to be studied
carefully, as I would hope, I would also hope that
scrupulous care be exercised against any premature
conclusions.

       "Mr. Dahmer's brain should, I would submit,
be carefully compared against the range of brains
from persons who exhibited normal and those
showing severely antisocial behavior.  In other
words, I submit that concluding anything from this
one brain by itself is perilous and
antiscientific.  If Dr. Pincus observes such
scientific conditions, I would see no problem, on
my part alone, in submitting that brain to his
study.  Sincerely."  And this bears Huntington's
signature.

       Go on.

       MR. FENNIG:  Now the matter with respect to
Mrs. Flint is that we have -- we have gone through
the cremation process, which happened within the
past two or three weeks.  And this ultimate
disposition of what is left of the remains of her
son would bring final closure to her, at least.
And -- and I believe there would be no other means
to do it better than this.

      It would satisfy her.  It would not be in --
against any interests of the public.  In fact, I
think the public may benefit from it.  And I don't
believe it would be in the -- against any
interests of Mr. Dahmer, the decedent himself, to
have this done.

      If you recall, by the means of his will --

      And I bring that up because Mr. Lionel Dahmer
made reference to it stating that any -- any such
disposal, either by cremation or the way we are
asking for it, would be against what he set forth
in his will.  Mr. -- He also indicated that he
didn't want to have any funeral services.  And 
Mr. Dahmer had, if you will recall, had a memorial
service within a couple of days after his death.

      The point is, really, closure for        
Mrs. Flint.  I think this would put her at rest.
It would satisfy her to the point that some good
has come out of all of this bad news in the last
couple of years.

      And for that reason her request is not
outrageous.  Her request is for the scientific --
whatever scientific good can be made of this and
I think deserves consideration by the Court.

      THE COURT:  Okay.  Mr. Dahmer, I will hear
from you.

      MR. DAHMER:  Okay.  As to Joyce Flint
contacting me personally, as she had said, she
has had no response to her personal attempts.
There were no personal attempts.  I addressed that
in my October 1st fax to you, Judge.

      THE COURT:  Okay.  Mr. Dahmer, just for your
information and to shorten up any kind of argument
that we might have here, the fact that Joyce Flint
may or may not have attempted to get your position
on this matter or any kind of negotiations really
has nothing to do with the Court's decision and
isn't important to me.

      MR. DAHMER:  I feel it's irrelevant, too.
But I just wanted to answer that, remember when I
broke in just a little bit ago.

      THE COURT:  Right.  Okay, go ahead.  On the
merits of the matter then.

      MR. DAHMER:  Okay.  I think I probably
summarized the main point of disregarding Jeff's
instructions in his last testament, and I feel
that that should take precedent.  It's not a
matter, I feel, of whether I do or don't want
scientific study.  I personally have strong
feelings regarding the nonefficacious character of
that proposal.  But that's neither here nor there.
I feel -- I feel that the main point is what
his last wishes were, and to violate that would be
legally wrong.

      THE COURT:  Okay.  Mr. --

      MR. DAHMER:  I could go on and on regarding
the efficacious or nonefficacious character of the
study, but I would rather -- I'm more of a writing
person as opposed to an articulate on the spot
verbal person, and I would rather put that in
writing.  But I want to emphasize at this moment
the compliance with his last testament, as for
anyone.

     THE COURT:  Mr. Fennig?

     MR. FENNIG:  If I can refer to his last
testament.  Page two of his Will, paragraph 4, he
stated, "Upon my death I wish for the body to be
cremated as soon as possible.  I do not want a
funeral ceremony to be performed before or after
the cremation.  No open casket.  No headstone or
marker."

     If you will recall, Mr. -- Mr. Dahmer saw to
a memorial service within days of the death of
Jeffrey. And if he wants to go literally, he
violated what he is now claiming would be a
violation of the intentions of the decedent.  So I
think that's close to being doublespeak.

     So, I think we do have a very good
possibility that possibly something good can come
of this by this scientific study.  And for that
reason, the motion has been made.

     THE COURT:  Mr. Dahmer, I'll give you one
brief opportunity to respond if you wish.

     MR. DAHMER:  Okay.  As to the funeral
service, it was a private memorial service for my
immediate family.  And if he wants to argue to
that point and seize upon that point, then he may
want to prosecute me regarding that.  But we are
talking about the disposal of the wishes of Jeff
for cremation of his body.  The brain is part of
his body.  That's all.

    THE COURT:  Okay.  The Court has heard
argument concerning this matter.  And I have
received -- or actually will state now that I will
receive Exhibit 1 and 2 from the two respective
physicians or doctors involved in this matter, 
Dr. Huntington and Dr. Pincus.

    The Court recognizes a rather unusual
situation here.  It's one that I have certainly
never encountered before and probably won't again.

    We do have competing interests from the two
parents of the deceased.  Those positions have
been expressed here today.  There is in essence a
balancing test that the Court needs to perform.

    I recognize the statement of the wishes of
Jeffrey Dahmer.  It was contained in a document
entitled his Last Will and Testament.  And
although it is not technically a legal will from
the standpoint of disposition of any of his
property, it's not officially been admitted to
probate.  In fact, there was a stipulation and
agreement by all parties that it wouldn't
constitute a legal will of sorts with any sort of
dispositive effect on what to do with his remains.
Nonetheless, it is an expression that the Court
gives some consideration to of the deceased's
wishes as to what's to be done with his body.

    And that certainly is a factor that the Court
takes into consideration here.

    I am also concerned with the issue of
closure.  This is a difficult situation in our
human existence, so to speak.  It's a rather evil
chapter.  And I believe that it would be
beneficial to the public and to all concerned that
there be closure, and that this matter be resolved
once and for all, and that we move on.

    There also obviously is some interest from a
scientific standpoint.  And perhaps there is some
good that could come from an otherwise
particularly vile series of events.  Perhaps there
is some type of scientific research that could be
conducted that might shed some kind of light on
why acts of this nature occurred.

    However, the Court is again looking at a
balancing kind of test there in terms of the
potential good and bad that could come from the
research.  There is -- or there are many different
types of scientific research that can be conducted
and many different levels of research that can
occur from good to bad in range.

    The Court is extremely concerned over the
potential for exploitation of this type of
research.  I am very concerned and I have made
some notes of my own, which pretty much coincided
with the kinds of concerns raised by
Dr. Huntington.

    I am very fearful over the type of inquiry
that's going to be made into this analysis.  What
sort of comparisons are going to be made?  What
sort of samples of population we are dealing with
in terms of comparing the tissue from Mr. Dahmer's
brain to other types of brains, brains from other
individuals.  I don't know what is contemplated,
and I am extremely concerned about the propriety
of the handling of this issue and the avoidance of
exploitation from the standpoint of any kind of
pop research, pop psychology, that kind of thing.

   So what I would like to do, Mr. Fennig, is I
would like something from Dr. Pincus that would
enlighten this Court in greater detail as to where
we are going with this.  Preferably I would like
an opportunity to have him testify, which could be
done by telephone just as Mr. Dahmer is
participating here today.  What I would like you
to do is contact Mr. Pincus -- or Dr. Pincus and
find out what his availability is and find out
whether he would be willing to submit a more
detailed analytical approach as to what direction
he intends to take with his analysis, and
preferably whether he would be willing to testify
by telephone.

    And after hearing that I would be inclined
to make a decision with respect to what to do with
this material.  Because at this point to just
carte blanche say, here you go, do with it as you
wish, is beyond what this Court is willing to
tolerate.  And we could end up with a situation
that digresses considerably from the purpose that
is contemplated.

    So, Mr. Dahmer, --

    MR. DAHMER:  Yes?

    THE COURT:  -- I will be getting some kind of
feedback from Attorney Fennig concerning
Dr. Pincus' position, at which time we will be
doing some scheduling of another hearing of this
nature.  And between now and then I would also
invite you to, as you indicated during your
argument here today --

    MR. DAHMER:  Yes.

    THE COURT:  -- you would like to present
further written argument to me, feeling that you
can do so in a more effective manner than
speaking --

    MR. DAHMER:  Well, the fact is I've been
sitting up at night in a motel room typing.

    THE COURT:  I recognize the difficulty in
terms of responding --

    MR. DAHMER:  Thank you.

    THE COURT:  -- extemporaneously here today.
So between now and the next hearing, if in
fact we are to have another hearing --    I would
contemplate such depending on what Dr. Pincus is
going to tell us.  Between now and then you may
submit anything in writing.

    You have received notice from Mr. Fennig of
today's proceedings, correct?

    MR. DAHMER:  Yes.

    THE COURT:  So you have his address.

    Anything you send to the Court should likewise be
copied to Mr. Fennig.

    MR. DAHMER:  I certainly will.

    THE COURT:  That will terminate then today's
proceedings.  Mr. Fennig, if you would contact my
scheduling clerk after you've received information
from Dr. Pincus and arrange for another hearing
of this nature, she will be able to accommodate
you.  Any questions?

     MR. FENNIG:  Just one thing.  I think what I
will also get will be a vitae with respect to
Dr. Pincus' qualifications.

     MR. DAHMER:  I'm sorry.  I can't hear that.

     THE COURT:  What he's saying is he would
attempt to get a vitae -- curriculum vitae, a
resume, whatever you want to call it -- from
Dr. Pincus.

    That would be very helpful for the Court, as
well.

    MR. FENNIG:  And I will send it to       
Mr. Dahmer prior to the hearing.

    THE COURT:  Anything Mr. Fennig sends to the
Court will likewise be sent to you, Mr. Dahmer.  I
assume he has your proper address.

    MR. DAHMER:  Yes, it is.  Thank you.

    THE COURT:  That will conclude today's
proceedings.

    MR. DAHMER:  Thank you, Judge.

    MR. FENNIG:  Thank you.

VERIFIED COMPLAINT


Plaintiff, R.E.M./Athens, Ltd. ("R.E.M./Athens"), for its Verified
Complaint against Defendant Hershey Food Corporation ("Hershey")
alleges as follows: 1. This is an action at law and in equity for
trademark and service mark infringement, unfair competition, trademark
and service mark dilution and injury to business reputation and
tarnishment, misappropriation of identity, unfair and deceptive trade
practices, and false advertising arising under the Trademark Act of
1946, as amended by the Trademark Law Revision Act of 1989, 15 U.S.C.
 1051 et seq. ("Lanham Act"); the Georgia anti- dilution statute,
O.C.G.A.  10-1-451, and the anti- dilution statutes of other states;
the Georgia Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, O.C.G.A. 
10-1-370 to -375,10-1- 451, and the deceptive trade practices acts of
other states; the Georgia Fair Business Practices Act of 1975,
O.C.G.A.  10-1-390 et seq., and the fair business practices acts of
other states; Georgia's false advertising statute, O.C.G.A. 
10-1-421, and the false advertising statutes of other states;
Georgia's fraudulent misrepresentation statute, O.C.G.A.  23-2-55;
and the common law. 2. R.E.M. is one of the most popular and
successful rock bands in the world.  One major element of R.E.M.s
success is their credibility with their fans, along with the integrity
and independence with which the band conducts its business affairs. 
R.E.M.s credibility is in part a function R.E.M.s policy not to
provide commercial endorsements.  R.E.M. routinely rejects all
commercial, sponsorship or tie-in requests, even those that would be
lucrative in the short-term.  R.E.M.s name and music are not for
sale, and their fans expect and respect the bands position. 
Nevertheless, without the permission or authorization of
R.E.M./Athens, Hershey has pirated the "R.E.M" name and trademark to
promote its KIT KAT candy bar in a manner that is likely to confuse
and deceive the public about an affiliation, connection or association
with R.E.M.  Hershey, as part of its KIT KAT advertising campaign, is
blatantly exploiting the R.E.M. name for crass commercial purposes by
conducting a "KIT KAT R.E.M. concert" sweepstakes contest.  Hersheys
promotional campaign is intended to confuse and deceive the public, is
an outrageous effort to draw on the commercial magnetism of the R.E.M.
name, and tarnishes the R.E.M. name and the artistic integrity they
strive to achieve. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 3. This Court has
jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties under Section 39
of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.  1121, and under 28 U.S.C.  1331,
1338.  This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiff's state law claims
under 28 U.S.C.  1338(b) because these claims are joined with
substantial and related claims under federal trademark law, and
pursuant to the doctrine of supplemental jurisdiction, 15 U.S.C. 
1367. 4. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1391, venue is proper in this
district because a substantial part of the acts complained of occurred
and are occurring in this district and in interstate commerce and the
defendant resides here by doing business in this district. THE PARTIES

R.E.M. THE BAND:  ITS MUSIC AND ITS REPUTATION 8. R.E.M. formed in
1980 in Athens, Georgia.  During the past fifteen years, R.E.M. has
developed a national and international reputation and grown into one
of the premier musical groups in the world. R.E.M.s well-deserved and
hard-earned reputation is reflected in the substantial and valuable
body of good will symbolized by the R.E.M. name and image.  In the
past fifteen years, R.E.M. has released nine albums, which have
worldwide sales in excess of thirty million units. 9. Together with
R.E.M.s popular success has been critical acclaim.  Describing
critical reaction to R.E.M.s first album, Murmur, Tony Fletcher wrote
in Remarks The Story of R.E.M. that 

The all-important taste makers among the press 

were equally excited, paving the bands tour 

across America with a red carpet of glowing 

reviews.  Rolling Stone gave "Murmur" an 

uncommonly high four stars ("intelligent, 

enigmatic, deeply involving . . . it reveals a 

depth and cohesiveness to R.E.M."); Musician 

("R.E.M. has the most hypnotizing sound of any 

group playing rock today"); Record ("music of 

movement and portent, driven with vague

obsession") and the New York Times ("will sound 

as fresh ten years from now as it does today") 

all followed through.

In fact, the writers at Rolling Stone named "Murmur" their album of
the year, and R.E.M. "Best New Artist."  By the 1990s, the critical
acclaim had not subsided.  R.E.M.s "Automatic For the People"
received five stars from Rolling Stone in 1992, and 1994s release,
"Monster," received four and a half stars.  According to Robert
Hilburn, music critic for the L.A. Times, R.E.M. has "reigned for a
decade as America's most acclaimed band."  "How R.E.M. Spells
Success," L.A. Times, p. 4 (Feb. 27, 1994). A Boston Globe column
described R.E.M. as "the best and most enduring American band of the
past 20 years." Matthew Gilbert, "R.E.M. From Murmur to Monster," p.
57 (June 11, 1995).  In June 1995, an article in the Christian Science
Monitor described R.E.M. as "arguably America's hottest rock band,"
noting that "[t]he band is regarded as a patriarch of alternative
rock.  Since the early '80s, other bands have admired R.E.M."  "R.E.M.
Erupts Into A Roar on "Monster" Tour," p. 13 (June 22, 1995).  R.E.M.
has received a significant number of awards in the United States,
including Grammy Awards and MTV Music Awards, as well as international
awards, including multiple Brit Awards (the British equivalent of the
Grammy Awards) for best international band, and other equivalent
professional awards throughout the world. 10. Popular and critical
acclaim is only one part of the R.E.M. story.  Since their inception,
R.E.M. has not provided product endorsements, and over time has turned
down and forgone untold millions of dollars.  In an era when other
bands provide product endorsements for tours, appearances, songs, and
albums, R.E.M. steadfastly and repeatedly has refused to participate
in a practice they personally view as offensive and inappropriate. 
For example, in his book R.E.M. Behind the Mask, Jim Greer writes of
the group's 1989 world tour: 

The band would hit the road shortly . . . for a 

nine-month world tour . . . .  And the band did 

it without the benefit of the seemingly

ubiquitous specter of corporate sponsorship, 

turning down possibly millions of dollars in the 

process.

In November 1994, Amusement Business previewed R.E.M.'s 200 date world
tour, noting "No sponsors will be along for the ride, however," and
quoting R.E.M.'s booking agent as follows 

They're the only band to go into Singapore, 

Taiwan and Hong Kong without any sponsor 

affiliation, including airlines and hotels. 

[T]hey would consider that selling themselves 

out.

"R.E.M. Tour to Cover 200 Markets Worldwide," Amusement Business, at 3
(Nov. 28, 1994).  The same is true in other areas as well.  In a time
when concert venues attract product sponsorships tied to splashing the
corporate name on venue signs, tickets and promotional material,
R.E.M. does its best to minimize any possible association between
R.E.M. and the corporate venue/ticket sponsor. A 1995 article
described R.E.M. as "a band that has in the past embraced populist
causes, as well as avoid corporate sponsorships." Billboard, at 8
(Jan. 14, 1995).  In fact, R.E.M.'s agreements with promoters include
the following as the first condition: 

There will be no sponsorship of any kind, whatsoever. 

R.E.M.'s ability to insist on these limitations and restrictions is
based, in part, on their Contract Rider for concert agreements, which
contains the following clear language: 

The name, logo, photograph or likeness of Artist 

(and the Members, shall not be used or

associated, directly or indirectly, with any 

product (whether sold at the venue or otherwise) 

or service without the Personal Manager's prior 

written approval.  [W]ithout the Personal 

Manager's prior written approval, Promoter shall 

neither represent, nor authorize or permit any 

other person or entity to represent, that this 

Engagement (or a Performance) is being promoted, 

sponsored, co-promoted, co-sponsored by any 

product or service, or by any person or entity 

manufacturing, distributing, selling or

otherwise dealing in or associated, directly or 

indirectly, with any product or service . . . . 

No sign, banner, logo or other material

advertising any product, service, or company 

shall be permitted on, above or near the stage 

at any time after the audience is admitted to 

the Venue.  No advertising, sponsorship, or 

other type of commercial endorsement (including 

the name and/or logo of any sponsor of the 

Venue) shall appear in any flyer, handbill, 

poster or other promotional or publicity 

material relating to, or in any way an

advertisement for, a Performance and/or this 

Engagement.

The Rider agreement further provides in connection with tickets 

Neither the name or Promoter nor Promoter's 

organization, nor the name of the Venue, shall 

appear on the tickets in type larger than ten 

percent (10%) of the size used for the [R.E.M.] 

logo described . . . above.  ABSOLUTELY NO 

ADVERTISING, SPONSORSHIP OR OTHER TYPE OF 

COMMERCIAL ENDORSEMENT (INCLUDING THE NAME 

AND/OR LOGO OF ANY SPONSOR OF THE VENUE) SHALL 

APPEAR ON THE TICKETS WITHOUT COMPANY'S PRIOR 

WRITTEN CONSENT.

R.E.M. insists on these limitations, which are in every agreement.
Part of R.E.M.'s character, personality and image is that they do not
endorse products. R.E.M.'s policy is a public one:  in magazine, radio
and newspaper interviews they have expressed the philosophy that
musical artists should not do commercials because it detracts from
their artistic integrity. 11. As least as early as April 19, 1980, and
long prior to the complained of acts of Defendant, R.E.M./Athens (and
its predecessors) began using, and continuously has used and therefore
acquired rights in, the trademark and service mark "R.E.M." for
entertainment services, recordings and clothing. 12. R.E.M./Athens is
the owner of federal trademark registrations for the following
trademarks: 

Mark -  R.E.M.

Reg. No. - 1,247,934 

Description of Goods

Entertainment services,
namely, live performances by a
vocal and instrumental group


Mark - R.E.M.

Reg. No. - 1,366,598

Description of Goods -
posters; t-shirts

Copies of the Certificate of Registration for these marks are attached
as Exhibits 1-2. 13. R.E.M./Athens' federal registrations for the
R.E.M. marks are, pursuant to Sections 15 and 33(b) of the Lanham Act,
15 U.S.C.  1065, 1115(b), incontestable, and consequently
R.E.M./Athens is entitled to a statutory presumption of "the exclusive
right to use the registered mark" for the goods and services covered
by the registrations. 14. The goods and services offered under the
distinctive and famous R.E.M. mark have been advertised and promoted
throughout the State of Georgia and the United States.  As a result of
the substantial efforts and organizational energy, R.E.M. has achieved
commercial success and favorable recognition and are widely recognized
and accepted by the public. The R.E.M. name and mark have been widely
used and are recognized throughout Georgia and the United States as an
indication of the source of the goods and services offered by the
group.  By virtue of this widespread and continuing use, the R.E.M.
mark has acquired secondary meaning and exclusively identify
R.E.M./Athens, and the group R.E.M., and their goods and services. 
The R.E.M. name and marks and goodwill associated with them are
distinctive and famous marks of inestimable value to R.E.M./Athens.
15. R.E.M.'s success, and continued success, is built on its
credibility with fans, critics, and the public.  Robert Hilburn of the
L.A. Times, attempting to describe the foundation for R.E.M.'s
success, pointed to the fact 

that the band saw that there was a dignity and 

reward in simply making music with character and 

heart rather than in copying the soulless 

commercialism . . . .  After eight studio albums 

. . . R.E.M. stands with its original

independence and vision intact.

A 1994 article in Billboard commented that "Through the years, R.E.M.
has been able to find success while retaining its artistic integrity."
 "Retail, Radio Expect R.E.M.'s Warner Set to Be A "Monster,"" p. 1
(Sept. 10, 1994).  An article in The San Francisco Chronicle analyzed
the importance of this attribute as follows 

Credibility -- or "cred," as the British call it 

-- is the widespread perception that an artist, 

band or individual has the respect not of the 

population at large, but of its peers.



In rock and roll, credibility always has been a 

desirable quality.


But cred has more to do with performance and 

integrity than with attitude or audience.  It is 

. . . remaining true to your beliefs.


Pearl Jam, Nirvana and R.E.M. are considered 

alternative bands by organizations such as 

Billboard and the Grammys, but they sell as 

many, if not more, records than mainstream acts. 

So what distinguishes them as alternative?  The 

answer:  their cred.  In part, it's the notion 

of credibility -- the idea that a band is 

creating a valid artistic statement rather than 

merely selling a contrived, commercial musical 

commodity.

Gina Arnold, "Cashing In On Cred," The San Francisco Chronicle, at 32
(Jan. 22, 1995).  This view of, and appreciation of, R.E.M. is
international.  The Sunday Times (London) noted in July 1995 

For as long as the deals have been struck, 

arguments have raged as to the ethics and 

aesthetics of corporate sponsorship.  For many 

artists less hard-headed about their financial 

objectives than the Rolling Stones or Michael 

Jackson, accepting the sponsor's shilling 

remains the equivalent of sleeping with the 

enemy.  Bruce Springsteen "won't even entertain 

the offers."  Nor will R.E.M. or U2.

Robert Sandall, "Sponsorship's Rocky Road" (July 2, 1995). 16. After
fifteen years, it is difficult to predict with any accuracy the amount
of money that R.E.M. has turned down from commercial endorsements.  It
is not something the group tracks.  Moreover, because most advertisers
are familiar with R.E.M.'s position, R.E.M. does not get as many
requests as it otherwise might receive.  However, using one recent
example, R.E.M. did receive a request from Microsoft's ad agency,
Wieden & Kennedy, to license R.E.M.'s song "It's the End of the World
As We Know It" for advertising use in Microsoft's worldwide brand
campaign. Significantly, Microsoft recently obtained permission
(through Wieden & Kennedy) to use a single Rolling Stones' song,
"Start Me Up," for a fee reported to be as high as $12 million.  Media
reports have emphasized that this deal and the amount involved are
significant because "the Rolling Stones never have before agreed to
have one of the songs they own the rights to be used in commercial
advertising." 

DEFENDANT'S UNAUTHORIZED ACTS

17.
Beginning on or before August 15, 1995, Hershey conducted a contest to
promote its KIT KAT bar.  The promotion included  radio advertising,
which on information and belief was part of a national radio campaign
on stations that play R.E.M.'s music, and thus represent its target
market.  In Atlanta, the radio advertisement aired on WNNX- FM (99.7),
and its text was as follows: 

Kit Kat wants to give you a chance to win a trip 

for two to the September 30th R.E.M. concert at 

Hershey Park Stadium or one of 25 copies of 

R.E.M.'s latest CD.  Be among the first 10,000 

people to call 1-800-455-9200 with your name and 

complete address and you'll be in the running 

for the KIT KAT concert trip to Hershey, 

Pennsylvania.  That's 1-800-455-9200.  Phone 

lines close August 18th.  No purchase necessary. 

Continental U.S. residents, eighteen plus.  For 

details send a self-addressed, stamped envelope 

to:  Kit Kat Rules, Box 535, Seaford, New York, 

11783.

18.
Hershey's "KIT KAT R.E.M. Concert" sweepstakes promotion radio
commercial does not use R.E.M.'s music, but rather includes generic
rock jingle music.  This background music is vastly inferior to
R.E.M.'s music, but unfortunately people likely are to believe that
R.E.M. is performing, or in some manner associated with, this
substandard, watered down, sound-alike accompaniment.  On information
and belief, Hershey and its advertising agency intended that this
background music, together the fact of and text of the commercial,
suggest or imply R.E.M.'s involvement, sponsorship or affiliation with
Hershey's KIT KAT contest. 19. Hershey's KIT KAT/R.E.M. radio
promotion included a toll-free number, which when called provided the
caller with a message and a prompt to leave a name and address to
enter the contest.  The text of the telephone message is as follows: 

Welcome to the Kit Kat R.E.M. concert at 

Hershey Park Stadium sweepstakes line where you 

will register for the chance to attend the 

R.E.M. concert during a four day/three night 

trip for two to Hershey, Pennsylvania September 

28 through October 1 or you could be one of 

twenty-five winners of R.E.M.'s latest CD.  For 

details send a self-addressed, stamped envelope 

to:  Kit Kat Rules, Box 535, Seaford, New York, 

11783.  Now after the tone leave your name and 

full mailing address, including city, state and 

zip code.

Hershey's sales exceed $3,000,000,000 in the United States, and closer
to $4,000,000,000 worldwide. Hershey's KIT KAT wafer bar is a
tremendously popular product.  According to published reports, KIT KAT
is one of the best selling candy bars in the country, and currently
third behind Snickers (M&M/Mars) and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups
(Hershey). 21. Hershey's was founded in 1893 by Milton Hershey, and
was one of the first, if not the first, chocolate manufacturer in the
United States.  According to Hoover's Handbook of American Business,
Mr. Hershey lived until 1945, and during his life he refused to let
Hershey advertise, believing that quality would speak for itself. The
company continued the no-advertising policy after his death until
1970. 22. Today, Hershey's advertising is extensive, and in 1994
Hershey spent in excess of $120 million on advertising.  KIT KAT wafer
bars are promoted heavily. Advertising is a vital component of
Hershey's sales. According to Hoover's Guide to American Businesses,
Hershey started advertising when it felt challenged by Mars for
leadership in chocolate sales.  According to the New York Times,
"[i]in 1992, Hershey pulled ahead of M&M/Mars, which had nosed it out
for the lead the year before.  Hershey's move came largely on the
strength of a spirited advertising campaign tied to its Olympics
sponsorship."  Linda Corman, "All About Chocolate," Sec. 3, p. 10
(Feb. 21, 1993). 23. Hershey is an experienced and influential
advertiser, and in particular is an entity that engages in a
significant amount of sponsorships. By way of example, in February
1995, Brandweek reported Hershey's sponsorship of the then upcoming
NCAA Final Four basketball tournament, noting 


Hershey next month steps up its sports

marketing commitments with a multi-brand 

promotion linked to the NCAA basketball

tournament's Final Four.


Hershey, a new NCAA corporate partner, . . 

. will drop a Final Four-themed FSI with special 

offers on all Hershey loose candy bars, and in 

coming weeks roll out in-store promo materials 

giving consumers a shot at a trip to the annual 

college hoop championship.


The Hershey and Reese's lines, along with 

such Hershey brands as Kit-Kat, Mounds and 

Almond Joy, will be flagged via in-store 

displays, with Final Four-logoed basketballs and 

jackets and tickets to this year's Final Four 

offered to retailers for tailorable local 

giveaways. An instore sweepstakes starts later 

this month, offering consumers a shot at an all- 

expenses-paid trip to next year's event. 


Hershey last fall activated its existing 

sponsorship of the NFL with a similar retail 

promotion. Its other sports ties include a 

Reese's NASCAR sponsorship and a figure skating 

package for its Kisses line.


In addition to contests and promotions with the NCAA Final Four, the
NFL (which included game tickets and merchandise), and NASCAR, Hershey
apparently also has engaged in recent years in sponsorships and joint
promotions with the 1992 Olympics, NCAA College World Series, the
Reese's International Gymnastics Cup (broadcast on ABC's Wide World of
Sports), the New York Road Runners Club (the New York Marathon), and
the U.S. Figure Skating Association.  In early 1995, Hershey sponsored
a "Gump Day" on VH1 with a call-in sweepstakes with callers winning
"Forrest Gump" merchandise and on-air promotional spots. In 1992,
Hershey sponsored a promotion with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences that included tickets to the Oscars presentation. 24.
Promotions and promotional tie-ins, such as that described in the
previous paragraph, are typical in modern advertising, and typical of
Hershey's advertising techniques.  When consumers hear about such
tie-ins, they assume that the corporate sponsor -- Hershey -- and the
object of the tie-in, whether the NCAA, NFL, NASCAR, or R.E.M., are
authorizing or licensing use of their name and marks.  Hershey intends
that consumers believe that an affiliation exists between Hershey and
these other groups. Hershey values these tie-ins because the
association allows Hershey to benefit from the good will possessed and
generated by the other party. 25. Businesses increasingly view groups
such as R.E.M., which may be labeled "Alternative" or "Modern Rock,"
as an entree to the lucrative high school and college age markets.  As
in other areas, advertisers use celebrities to promote their products.
 The more popular the celebrity, the greater the number of people who
recognize him or her, and the greater the visibility for the product. 
Earlier this month Billboard magazine featured a front page story
titled "Madison Avenue Eyes Modern Rock, But Acts Remain Wary." 
However, according to that article 

Yet just as marketers become convinced that an 

alternative association helps loosen wallets, 

most performers riding today's wave are

concerned about cashing in their street

credibility and seem less interested than their 

predecessors in signing on the dotted line. 

Rarely has corporate America had so much trouble 

having its checks cashed.  "There are millions 

of dollars out there, . . . but you have acts 

who want nothing to do with it."

Billboard, p.1, 71 (August 5, 1995).
26.
On information and belief, Hershey's "KIT KAT R.E.M. Concert"
sweepstakes promotion is part of Hershey's effort to attract and to
tap into this young market, and is part of other Hershey efforts.  For
example, Hershey apparently signed on recently as a sponsor for an
"advertiser sponsored" Internet World Wide Web 'mega-site" targeting
college students. 27. Hershey is not currently, and never was,
authorized or licensed by R.E.M./Athens to use the R.E.M. name for any
purposes. 28. Hershey never sought authorization or approval from
R.E.M. for its "KIT KAT R.E.M. Concert" sweepstakes promotion.  On
information and belief, Hershey's failure to seek permission was
based, at least in part, on Hershey's knowledge or understanding that 
R.E.M./Athens would not authorize use of the R.E.M. name for product
endorsements. In other words, Hershey decided that if it could not buy
the name, it would not ask, but it still would appropriate what is not
theirs to sell a product. 29. Despite constructive notice of
R.E.M./Athens' rights, and on information and belief actual knowledge,
Hershey knowingly advertised and promoted its own candy bar using the
R.E.M name.  In running the commercial, and the promotion, Hershey
knowingly took a calculated risk, consciously disregarding the effect
of these actions on R.E.M.'s legally cognizable rights. 30. Hershey's
unauthorized use of the R.E.M. name creates the false and misleading
impression that Hershey's goods are affiliated, connected, related or
associated with R.E.M./Athens, or have the sponsorship, endorsement or
approval of R.E.M./Athens. 31. Because the public associates the
R.E.M. name with R.E.M./Athens, Hershey's unauthorized use of "R.E.M."
presents a substantial likelihood of public confusion, mistake, and
deception. Hershey's unauthorized use also is eroding the public's
exclusive identification of the R.E.M. name, thus diminishing its
distinctiveness, uniqueness, commercial effectiveness and prestigious
connotations. 32. Hershey's unlicensed and unauthorized use of the
R.E.M. name causes a likelihood of confusion and harm to
R.E.M./Athens, and on information and belief has caused actual
confusion.  The specific nature of the infringement is embarrassing,
and its impact is both potentially devastating and difficult to
immediately quantify.  Because of R.E.M.'s public stance against doing
product endorsements, the strong inference of Hershey's "KIT KAT
R.E.M. Concert" is that the group members apparently are hypocrites.
33. Hershey's use and continued use of R.E.M. despite actual and
constructive notice of R.E.M./Athens' rights demonstrates an
intentional, willful, and bad faith intent to create confusion,
mistake and deception of the public and to trade on R.E.M./Athens'
rights and established goodwill, by implying a nonexistent
association, connection, affiliation or relationship with
R.E.M./Athens to the great and irreparable injury of R.E.M./Athens. 


COUNT I

FEDERAL TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT: SECTION 32(1) OF THE LANHAM ACT 34.
Plaintiff repeats and incorporates the allegations of paragraphs 1
through 33 above as if fully set forth herein. 35. Hershey has
advertised and offered for sale goods in interstate commerce using
designations and representations, including the R.E.M. name, identical
to Plaintiff's federally-registered R.E.M. marks. 36. Hershey's use of
marks identical to Plaintiff's federally-registered R.E.M. marks in
connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, and
advertising of Hershey's goods, and on or in connection with such use,
is likely to cause confusion, to cause mistake, or to deceive. 37.
When Hershey engaged in the conduct outlined above, it knew or should
have known of R.E.M./Athens' use of, rights to, and registration of
the R.E.M. marks. Hershey's unauthorized use of these marks for its
own significant commercial benefit demonstrates a willful and bad
faith infringement. 38. Hershey's infringing actions are causing and
are likely to cause substantial injury to the public and to
R.E.M./Athens because these activities are likely to cause confusion,
or to cause mistake, or to deceive purchasers and the public. 39.
Hershey's designations and representations as set forth above, being
false and deceptive and likely to cause confusion, or to cause
mistake, or to deceive, violate Section 32(1) of the Lanham Act, 15
U.S.C.  1114(1). 40. Hershey's conduct is causing and is likely to
cause substantial injury to the public and to R.E.M./Athens, and
R.E.M./Athens is entitled to injunctive relief, and to recover
damages, including without limitation the fair market value of their
services and injury to their good will, professional standing and
future publicity value, and Hershey's profits, all subject to
trebling, costs and reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to 15 U.S.C.
 1114, 1116 and 1117. COUNT II FEDERAL UNFAIR COMPETITION AND FALSE
ENDORSEMENT: SECTION 43(a) OF THE LANHAM ACT 

41.
Plaintiff repeats and incorporates the
allegations of Paragraphs 1 through 40 above as if fully set forth
herein. 42. Hershey has used and is using in commerce words, terms,
names, symbols, devices and combinations thereof, false designations
of origin, false and misleading descriptions of fact, and false and
misleading representations of fact, including R.E.M.'s name and "sound
alike" music, likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to
deceive as to the affiliation, connection or association of Hershey
and its goods and commercial activities with Plaintiff R.E.M./Athens.
43. Hershey has used and is using in commerce words, terms, names,
symbols, devices and combinations thereof, false designations of
origin, false and misleading descriptions of fact, and false and
misleading representations of fact, including R.E.M.'s name and "sound
alike" music, likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to
deceive as to the origin, sponsorship or approval of Hershey and
Hershey's goods and commercial activities by R.E.M./Athens. 44.
R.E.M./Athens has been, is, and likely will continue to be, damaged by
Hershey's false and misleading designations, descriptions and
representations because such false and misleading designations,
descriptions, and representations create a likelihood of confusion,
mistake and deception. 45. Because of Hershey's false and misleading
designations, descriptions and representations, R.E.M./Athens is
suffering damage to its business, reputation, and good will. 46.
Hershey's designations, and representations, being false and
misleading, violate Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. 
1125(a). 47. Hershey's conduct is causing and is likely to cause
substantial injury to the public and to R.E.M./Athens, and
R.E.M./Athens is entitled to injunctive relief, and to recover
damages, including without limitation the fair market value of their
services and injury to their good will, professional standing and
future publicity value, and Hershey's profits, all subject to
trebling, costs and reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to 15 U.S.C.
 1114, 1116 and 1117. COUNT III VIOLATION OF THE GEORGIA
ANTI-DILUTION STATUTE AND THE ANTI-DILUTION STATUTES AND LAWS OF OTHER
STATES 

48.
Plaintiff repeats and incorporates the
allegations of paragraphs 1 through 47 above as if fully set forth
herein. 49. R.E.M./Athens is the owner of the distinctive and famous
R.E.M. marks.  Through widespread and favorable public acceptance and
recognition, the R.E.M. name and mark have acquired secondary meaning
and have become associated uniquely with R.E.M./Athens and its goods
and services, and are of inestimable value to R.E.M./Athens as widely-
recognized symbols of its goods and services. 50. Hershey, by using
the R.E.M. mark in connection with and as an advertising and
promotional tool for its products, has diluted the reputation of the
distinctive R.E.M. mark by eroding the public's exclusive
identification of the mark with R.E.M./Athens, thus diminishing its
distinctiveness and effectiveness. 51. Hershey, by using the R.E.M.
name in advertising and promotional material in connection with its
KIT KAT candy bar, and by using inferior rock jingle "sound alike"
music has tarnished and caused injury to the reputation of the
distinctive R.E.M.'s name and mark, thus diminishing its
distinctiveness and value. 52. Hershey's conduct is causing and will
continue to cause irreparable injury to R.E.M.'s goodwill and
reputation, and dilution of the distinctive and valuable quality of
R.E.M.'s name and mark in violation of the Georgia anti- dilution
statute, O.C.G.A.  10-1-451, and the anti- dilution statutes and law
of other states, and R.E.M./Athens is entitled to injunctive relief
and other relief appropriate under the following statutes:  Alabama,

1992); and the common law of certain other states. COUNT IV
MISAPPROPRIATION OF PERSONAL AND CORPORATE IDENTITY 53. Plaintiff
repeats and incorporates the allegations of paragraphs 1 through 52
above as if fully set forth herein. 54. R.E.M./Athens' goods and
services offered under the R.E.M. mark are known for their quality by
consumers and potential consumers and the public.  The group's
identity, name and trademarks, and the identity of the group's
individual members, represent a substantial portion of the vast good
will of R.E.M./Athens and the reputation of the company. 55. As
expressed in the Restatement (Second) of Torts, the interests
protected by a rule against the appropriation of name or likeness is
the interest of the owner "in the exclusive use of his own identity,
insofar as it is represented by his name or likeness."   652C, cmt.
a, at 381 (1977).  Misappropriation occurs when a defendant
appropriates for its "own use or benefit the reputation, prestige,
social or commercial standing, public interest or other values of the
plaintiff's name or likeness."  652C, cmt. c, at 382.  Unlike other
causes of action for an invasion of privacy, a corporation may have
"the same rights and remedies as those to which a private individual
is entitled under the rule stated in  652C."   652I, cmt. c, at 403.
56. By advertising, promoting, and selling their KIT KAT candy bar
using the R.E.M. name, Hershey has appropriated for its own use or
benefit the corporate identity, reputation, prestige, commercial
standing, and good will of R.E.M./Athens and its goods and services,
as well as the personal identity of the group members of R.E.M., and
it has otherwise sought to obtain for itself the values or benefits of
R.E.M.'s identity, reputation and good will. 57. Hershey's
appropriation of R.E.M./Athens' identity, reputation, prestige,
commercial standing, and good will, and the identity of the group's
members, is designed and intended to, and has the effect of,
advertising Hershey's business and products and of serving other
commercial purposes of Hershey. 58. Hershey's acts constitute
misappropriation of R.E.M./Athens' corporate identity, and the
identity of the collective group members under the common law of
Georgia and the common law of the several states. R.E.M./Athens
therefore is entitled to an injunction prohibiting such conduct and
other appropriate relief, including damages. COUNT V VIOLATION OF THE
GEORGIA DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES ACT AND THE DECEPTIVE TRADE
PRACTICES ACTS OF OTHER STATES 

59.
Plaintiff repeats and incorporates the
allegations of Paragraphs 1 through 58 above as if fully set forth
herein. 60. By reason of the acts set forth above, Hershey has
willfully and knowingly engaged in false and deceptive trade practices
in violation of the Georgia Deceptive Trade Practices Act, O.C.G.A. 
10-1-370 to -375; and the deceptive trade practices acts of other
states, by: 

(a) Causing likelihood of confusion or of 

misunderstanding as to the source, sponsorship, 

approval of Hershey's goods;


(b) Causing likelihood of confusion or of 

misunderstanding as to the affiliation,

connection or association of Hershey with, or 

certification by, R.E.M./Athens; and

(c) Engaging in other conduct which similarly 

creates a likelihood of confusion or of

misunderstanding.

In addition to Georgia law, R.E.M./Athens also is entitled to relief
under the unfair and deceptive trade practices acts in other states,
including the following:  Colorado, Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann  6-1-101 to
6-1-105; Delaware, Del. Code Ann. tit. 6,  2531; Hawaii, Haw. Rev.
Stat.  481A-1 to 481A-5; Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 10,  1211;
Nebraska, Neb. Rev. Stat.  87-301 to 87-306; New Mexico, N.M. Stat.
Ann.  57-12-1 to 57-12-22; Ohio, Ohio Rev. Code Ann.  4165.01 to
4165.04; Oklahoma, Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 78, 51; and Oregon, Or. Rev.
Stat.  646.605 to 646.656. 61. Hershey's willful and knowing
deceptive trade practices have caused and are likely to cause
substantial injury to the public and to R.E.M./Athens and
R.E.M./Athens is entitled to injunctive relief, damages, attorneys'
fees and other relief pursuant to O.C.G.A.  10-1-370 to -375, and
the law of other states. 

COUNT VI

VIOLATIONS OF THE GEORGIA FAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES ACT 

AND THE FAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES ACTS OF OTHER STATES 

62.
Plaintiff repeats and incorporates the
allegations of Paragraphs 1 through 61 above as if fully set forth

TO:  ALL PLAYERS

cc: ALL PLAYER AGENTS

FROM: BUCK WILLIAMS
      SIMON P. GOURDINE


===================================


      We want to make certain that every player is fully
informed about the terms of the proposed agreement that has
been reached with the NBA so that each of you will be able
to cast an intelligent vote in the NLRB-conducted
decertification election on August 30th and September 7th.
Please note that our August 10th memo already provided you
with a detailed description of "The Resolution of the
Outstanding Issues Resulting from the Player Rep Mandate of
June 21" (See Part I at pages 1-3 of the August 10th memo);
and (2) a description of the principal[sic] terms of the
June 21st Agreement that were not modified by the August 8th
Agreement (See Part II at pages 3-7 of the August 10th
memo).

      We have now prepared for your further information
another document entitled "III - Miscellaneous Unmodified
Terms from The June 21 Proposed Agreement." This document
sets forth an assortment of less significant proposed terms
that we do not believe will play a critical role in your
evaluation of the overall proposed agreement. If you staple
this document to pages 1-7 of the August 10th memo you will
have in one document the terms agreed upon in the
negotiations, all of which are subject to your approval.

      In accordance with standard practice, the lawyers for
the Players Association and the NBA will get together to
begin the process of incorporating the various terms of the
parties' proposed agreement into the language of a formal,
full-blown collective bargaining agreement In the meantime,
we are enclosing a copy of a one-page letter dated August
18th 1995, from Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik confirming
that the NBA has reviewed in advance the various terms
described in Parts I-III of the documents you now have in
your possession, and has agreed that those terms will form
the basis of a new collective bargaining agreement to be
prepared by the lawyers for the Players Association and the
NBA.

     As you know, we have already begun a series of player
meetings throughout the country to fill you in on the terms
of the proposed agreement. Please make sure to attend and
raise any questions you may have. In the event you are
unable to attend, please call us with your questions.

TO:  ALL PLAYERS

cc: ALL PLAYER AGENTS

FROM: BUCK WILLIAMS
      SIMON P. GOURDINE


===================================

      We all have witnessed the dissension that has
developed among players, agents, and the Union over the past
two months as a result of the decertification initiative.
Fortunately, the dissension was put to some good use: the
Union was able tO use the decertification initiative to
pressure the NBA into improving our earlier agreement to the
great benefit of all players. Now, however, the job is done.
I am writing to ask that we all put the rhetoric and bad
will of the past two months behind us and focus --
uninhibited -- solely on the merits of the proposed
agreement, which we strongly believe is in the best
interests of all players. More specifically, I write to
assure you that if the Players Association succeeds in the
upcoming decertification election, and we have every
confidence that we will, we intend to resume, unchanged in
every respect, the open and cooperative relationship we have
long enjoyed with every player agent.

      It has come to my attention that while many of you
agree that the best interests of the players lie in
defeating decertification and approving the proposed
agreement with the NBA, you may be somewhat hesitant to
throw your full support behind the proposed agreement and
the Union for fear that if the Union wins the upcoming
decertification election, the Union will "retaliate" against
the agent community at large for the role of certain agents
in the decertification initiative. I do not know where this
fear emanates from, and whether it is being exploited by
certain leaders of the decertification movement to forestall
defections from their ranks, but I do know and can give you
my complete assurance that this fear is entirely
unjustified.

      If the Union wins the election, our overriding
objective will be to repair the distasteful dissension among
players that has resulted from the decertification
initiative. To this end, we would no more lash out against
player agents for their role in the decertification effort
than we would harbor a grudge against individual players who
have supported decertification. We fully appreciate the fact
that unity among players cannot be achieved by the pursuit
of any "retaliation" policy that would further divide the
Union and the agent community, and the Union quite simply
has no intention of pursuing any such policy.

      We hope to immediately begin the process of unifying
the players by convincing you to throw your full support
behind the Union and the proposed agreement with the NBA. We
have sent you a copy of all principal and non-
principal[sic] terms of the agreement for your review, and
our staff and I will be contacting as many of you as
possible in the days before the upcoming decertification
election to address any questions that you may have about
the proposed agreement. In the meantime, please evaluate the
proposed agreement on its merits, and not based on any
misplaced fears concerning union "retaliation" against the
agent community.

      I look forward to speaking with you.


S.P.G.

PRACTICES AND UNFAIR COMPETITION; INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES 

[JURY TRIAL DEMANDED]

Plaintiff brings this action against defendants for the claims
specified below and seeks injunctive relief and damages as follows: 

PARTIES

1.   The plaintiff is Interscope Records, Inc., a California
corporation, as the managing general partner of INTERSCOPE RECORDS, a
California general partnership ("Interscope").  has its principal
place of business in the Central District of California, Western
Division. Interscope is a joint venture partnership between Interscope
Records, Inc. and Atlantic Ventures, Inc., a nominal defendant herein.


2.   Interscope is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges,
that the defendant, C. DeLores Tucker ("), an individual, resides in
and is a citizen of a state other than California 

3.   Interscope names as a nominal defendant, against which it seeks
no relief in this action, Atlantic Ventures, Inc. ("Atlantic"), a
Delaware corporation, headquartered in the State of New York. 

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4.   Jurisdiction exists in this action under the principle of
diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C.  1332, in that the matter in
controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs; and the
Plaintiff and all of the defendants are citizens of different states. 

5.   Venue is properly laid in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 
1392.  Interscope is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges,
that at all relevant times Tucker engaged in certain wrongful acts
alleged below in the Central District of California, Western Division,
and engaged in other unlawful acts outside this District which caused
injury to Interscope in this District.  Accordingly, venue properly
lies in this District. 

GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

6.   Interscope is a California general partnership consisting of
Interscope Records, Inc. and Atlantic Ventures, Inc.  ("Atlantic"), an
affiliate of Time Warner Inc.  ("Time Warner").  Interscope is one of
the most successful record labels in the world. 

7.   Interscope has entered into valuable exclusive contractual
arrangements with other record companies which furnish to Interscope
recordings by artists for exclusive distribution through the
Interscope label.  Among such companies is Death Row Records, Inc.
("Death Row Records"), with whom Interscope has an exclusive
distribution agreement (the "Death Row Records Contract"). 

8.   Interscope's exclusive contractual
relationship with Death Row Records, and Time Warner's involvement in
the Interscope partnership, have been widely publicized, and upon
information and belief, are known by Tucker. 

9.   Beginning in mid-1995 and continuing to the present, Tucker,
together with others whose identities are currently unknown to
Interscope, embarked upon and has continued to engage in a scheme and
conspiracy to destroy Interscope by committing extortion, threats and
other unlawful acts.  Among other things, Tucker has (a) attempted to
induce Death Row Records to breach the Death Row Records Contract; (b)
interfered with Interscope's valuable relationship with Death Row
Records; (c) damaged Interscope's reputation and credibility in the
music industry; and (d) attempted to induce Atlantic and Time Warner
to breach their fiduciary obligations to Interscope. is informed and
believes, and on that basis alleges, that Tucker has pursued such
unlawful acts in order to create a record distribution company to
distribute recordings produced by Death Row Records and other record
companies and recording artists, for her own personal and financial
gain. 

10.  Specifically, in or about July or August, 1995, Tucker attempted
to pressure Death Row Records into severing its relationship with
Interscope and appointing Tucker and her associates as Death Row
Records's exclusive representative to negotiate a production and
distribution agreement directly with Time Warner.  As Tucker well
knew, if Death Row Records proceeded on that course, it would result
in a breach by Death Row Records of the Death Row Records Contract and
a breach by Atlantic and Time Warner of their fiduciary obligations to
Interscope, which would effectively destroy Interscope. 

11.  In order to induce Death Row Records to accede to her unlawful
demands, Tucker engaged in extortion and other improper conduct in or
about July and August of 1995, including the following: 

(a)  In a meeting in Seattle, Washington, attended by Suge Knight
("Knight"), the Chairman of Death Row Records, David Kenner
("Kenner"), the attorney for Death Row Records, and others, Tucker
told Knight that she wanted to set up a record distribution company
which she would control, and in which Knight would have an interest. 
She made it clear to Knight that Death Row Records' willingness to
break away from Interscope was an integral part of her scheme.  Tucker
stated that she had had numerous private conversations about her plan
with Gerald Levin ("Levin"), the Chairman of the Board of Directors of
Time Warner, and Michael Fuchs ("Fuchs"), the Chairman of the Warner
Music Group, and that they were prepared to support Tucker by putting
up "incredible amounts of money." Tucker stated, however, that Levin
and Fuchs would go along with Tucker only if they believed that Tucker
had the ability to control the lyrics on recordings produced by Death
Row Records. Therefore, Tucker attempted to induce Knight into
deceiving Levin and Fuchs into believing that she could control the
lyrics, even though Knight made it clear to Tucker that he would not
permit such control.  In order to accomplish her deception, Tucker
sought to have Knight agree to a false and fraudulent press release,
and to stand beside Tucker at a press conference to falsely convey to
Levin and Fuchs that she could control Knight and Death Row Records. 

(b)  In numerous telephone calls and meetings thereafter, Tucker and
her associates threatened Knight that if he did not cause Death Row
Records to break away from Interscope, Tucker would use her power and
influence, and would cause Time Warner to use its power and influence,
to get the Government "to go after" Knight and his attorney by
investigating and prosecuting them.  Knight was specifically
threatened that as a result he would spend the rest of his life in
jail. 

(c)  Furthermore, Tucker and her associates threatened that if Knight
did not cause Death Row Records to break away from Interscope, Tucker
would use her influence with the press, and Time Warner would use
"billions of dollars to manipulate the press" to destroy Knight and
Death Row Records. Knight was told, "Even something completely
innocent can be made to look terrible." 

(d)  Tucker told Knight that he could avoid terrible consequences if
he would cooperate with her, that Time Warner would pay him "an
enormous amount of money," and that Knight would be given an ownership
interest in her contemplated record distribution company, if Knight
would authorize Tucker and her associates to negotiate a deal on
behalf of Death Row Records with Time Warner, which would "eliminate
Interscope." 

(e)  Subsequently, Tucker claimed that she had spoken with Fuchs, and
that Fuchs was prepared to have Time Warner pay Knight $80 million,
and build two state of the art recording studios for him, if Knight
would cooperate with Tucker. 

(f)  Tucker and her associates continued to apply pressure upon Knight
and Death Row Records.  On August 7, 1995, Tucker or her associates
told Knight that Fuchs was flying from New York to Los Angeles that
evening "to close the deal" with Knight.  Tucker delivered to Knight a
letter for Knight's signature, which Tucker had prepared, which would
appoint Tucker and her associates as Death Row Records' exclusive
representative to negotiate an "acceptable contract relationship with
Time Warner regarding the production and distribution" of Death Row
Records' recordings. 

(g)  Throughout Wednesday, August 8, 1995, Knight received numerous
telephone messages from Tucker or her associates that Fuchs was at
Dianne Warwick's home in Los Angeles waiting to meet with Knight.  As
the day progressed, they told Knight that Fuchs had assured them that
if he was not satisfied with the terms previously proposed to Knight
to eliminate Interscope, Fuchs was willing to be flexible in the
negotiations.  Finally, Knight was told that Fuchs had been waiting
for eight hours to meet with Knight, and had to get on a plane to fly
back to New York, and, therefore, Knight was urged to immediately meet
with Tucker, Fuchs and others to consummate a deal. 

(h)  During the evening of August 8, 1995, Knight received a telephone
call from Tucker or her associates stating that Fuchs was flying back
to New York, and wanted to call Knight from his airplane. 

12.  The foregoing conduct by Tucker and her associates was unlawful,
in bad faith, and in furtherance of her scheme and conspiracy. 

FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF

[Inducing Breach of Contract, Interfering with Contractual Relations
and Prospective Business Advantage] 

13.  Interscope realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1
through 12, inclusive, as though set forth at length. 

14.  The Death Row Records Contract is a valid and existing contract
between Interscope and Death Row Records. Interscope is informed and
believes, and on that basis alleges, that Tucker had knowledge of the
Death Row Records Contract and intentionally attempted to induce a
breach by Death Row Records or to disrupt the Death Row Records
Contract through unlawful means.  In so doing, Tucker's purpose was to
damage Interscope's credibility with recording artists, songwriters,
and producers, and to interfere with Interscope's prospective business
advantage, in order to accomplish her scheme of establishing a record
distribution company which would, among other things, distribute
recordings, produced by Death Row Records. 

15.  As a direct result of the actions of Tucker and her associates,
the contractual relationship between Interscope and Death Row Records
has been disrupted, and Interscope has suffered actual and potential
damages in an amount as yet unknown.  Interscope shall amend its
complaint to set forth the amount of its damages when ascertained. 

16.  The wrongful acts by Tucker were willful, wanton, malicious, and
oppressive, and were undertaken with the intent to injure Interscope
and to further Tucker's scheme and conspiracy to establish a record
distribution company for her own profit and gain.  Such conduct
therefore justifies an award of exemplary and punitive damages in an
amount to be proven at trial 

SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF

[Injunctive Relief]

17.  Interscope realleges and incorporates by reference its
allegations in paragraphs 1 through 12, inclusive, as though set forth
at length. 

18.  Interscope is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges,
that Tucker, and others acting in concert with Tucker, intend to
continue to cause damage and injury to Interscope unless enjoined, by,
among other things,  (a) seeking to induce Death Row Records to breach
the Death Row Records Contract,  (b) interfering with the Death Row
Records Contract, and (c) interfering with Interscope's prospective
business advantage. 

19.  Interscope has suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable
harm, for which Interscope does not have an adequate remedy at law,
unless Tucker and her associates are enjoined. 

20.  Accordingly, Interscope is entitled to a preliminary injunction
and permanent injunction prohibiting Tucker, and all those acting in
concert with Tucker, from (a) attempting to induce Death Row Records,
or any other party to a contract with Interscope, to breach any
existing contract; (b) interfering with Interscope's existing
contractual relationships; and (c) tortiously interfering with
Interscope's prospective business advantage. 

THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF

[Injunctive Relief For Attempting To Induce A Breach of Fiduciary
Duty] 

21.  Interscope realleges and incorporates by reference its
allegations in paragraphs 1 through 12, inclusive, as though set forth
at length. 

22.  Tucker knowingly, willfully and intentionally, and through the
use of unlawful means, has attempted to induce Time Warner, and its
subsidiary, Atlantic, to breach their fiduciary obligations to
Interscope, and to destroy the relationship between the partners
comprising Interscope. 

23.  Interscope is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges
that, unless enjoined, Tucker intends to continue to attempt to induce
Time Warner and Atlantic to breach their fiduciary obligations to
Interscope. Such unlawful conduct by Tucker and her associates will
continue to disrupt the relationship between the partners comprising
Interscope, will create uncertainty in the music industry about
Interscope's stability and viability, and will cause a loss of
credibility and other irreparable harm to Interscope. 

24.  Interscope does not have an adequate remedy at law for the full
amount of damages and injury suffered as a result of the unlawful
actions by Tucker and her associates. 

25.  Accordingly, Interscope is entitled to a preliminary injunction
and permanent injunction prohibiting Tucker, and all those acting in
concert with her, from seeking to induce Time Warner and/or Atlantic
to breach their fiduciary obligations to Interscope, or to otherwise
unlawfully interfere with the business relationship between the
partners comprising Interscope. 

FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF

[Unfair Business Practices and Unfair Competition] 

26.  Interscope realleges and incorporates by reference its
allegations in paragraph 1 through 12, inclusive, as though set forth
at length. 

27.  The wrongful conduct by Tucker and her associates alleged above
constitutes unfair business practices and unfair competition in
violation of Interscope's rights under California Business and
Professions Code Section 17200 et seq. 

28.  As a direct and proximate result of the foregoing unfair and
unlawful conduct, Interscope has incurred irreparable harm and has
been deprived of its property rights for which Interscope has no
remedy at law. 

29.  Interscope is entitled to a preliminary injunction and a
permanent injunction to prohibit Tucker, and all those acting in
concert with her, from violating the foregoing statute; and Interscope
is further entitled to all other relief against Tucker and her
associates as is authorized by the statute. 

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays judgment as follows: 

1.   For compensatory damages in amount to be proven at trial; 

2.   For exemplary and punitive damages in an amount to be proven at
trial; 

3.   For a preliminary injunction and permanent injunction to restrain
Tucker, and all those acting in concert with her, from continuing to
engage in extortion and other unlawful activities for the purpose of
(a) inducing or attempting to induce a breach of contract by any party
to a contract with Interscope, including but not limited to the
contract between Death Row Records and Interscope;  (b) interfering
with Interscope's prospective business advantage; (c) inducing or
attempting to induce Time Warner and/or Atlantic to breach their
fiduciary obligations to Interscope; (d) interfering with the business
relationship between the partners comprising Interscope; and (e)
engaging in unfair business practices and/or unfair competition. 

4.   For reasonable attorneys fees and costs expended in the
prosecution of this action, to the full extent permitted by law; 

5.   For pre-judgment interest to the full extent authorized by law;
and 

6.   For such other and further relief as this Court may deem just and
proper.

TELEPICTURES, and each of them, had an affirmative duty to prevent
and/or refrain from placing Plaintiff's Decedent, SCOTT AMEDURE in a
position which would unnecessarily and unreasonably expose him to the
risk of harm. 

32. That the Defendants, WARNER BROS., THE JENNY JONES SHOW and
TELEPICTURES, and each of them, breached their duties in the following
particulars, by way of illustration, and not limitation: 

a. By way of extreme and outrageous conduct the said Defendants did
intentionally and/or recklessly cause severe emotional distress to
JONATHAN SCHMITZ, thereby foreseeably subjecting Plaintiff's Decedent
to bodily harm from SCHMITZ; 

b. Negligently subjecting Plaintiff's Decedent SCOTT AMEDURE to an
unreasonable risk of harm from JONATHAN SCHMITZ, which harm was
foreseeable in that a reasonable person could or should foresee that
the situation created by the Defendants, and each of them, would
humiliate, embarrass, and/or mortify Defendant JONATHAN SCHMITZ to
such an extent that violence against Plaintiff's Decedent would be
incited; 

c. Negligently subjecting Plaintiff's Decedent to the risk of
negligent and/or reckless harm by a third person, i.e. JONATHAN
SCHMITZ; 

d. Negligently failing to recognize that the conduct of the
Defendants, and each of them, would subject Plaintiff's Decedent to an
unreasonable risk of harm from JONATHAN SCHMITZ, even though such
conduct by JONATHAN SCHMITZ might be criminal; 

e. Negligently acting in such a manner so as to either intend, likely
effect or induce the described conduct of JONATHAN SCHMITZ such that
the Defendants, and each of them, knew or should have know that it was
likely that an unreasonable risk of harm to Plaintiff's Decedent would
be created; 

f. Negligently subjecting the Plaintiff's Decedent to an unreasonable
risk of harm by subjecting JONATHAN SCHMITZ to an emotional
disturbance of such a character so as to likely result in bodily harm
to the Plaintiff's Decedent; 

g. Negligently failing to provide to JONATHAN SCHMITZ  such
information as would allow him to make a full and complete informed
decision as to whether he should subject himself to the embarrassment
and humiliation caused the scenario created by the Defendants; and
further, by providing false information to JONATHAN SCHMITZ about the
true nature of the show in which he was to participate, thereby
subjecting Plaintiff's Decedent to peril as stated herein: 

h. Intentionally, negligently and/or unreasonably subjecting JONATHAN
SCHMITZ to such emotional distress which the Defendants, and each of
them, should have recognized would likely result in the risk of bodily
harm to Plaintiff's Decedent; 

i. Negligently misrepresenting to JONATHAN SCHMITZ the true nature of
the television show in which he would appear such that by such
misrepresentation, the Defendants, and each of them, foreseeably
subjected Plaintiff's Decedent to an unreasonable risk of harm; 

j. Negligently failing to warn Plaintiff r S Decedent, SCOTT AMEDURE
of the risk of physical violence to  him by JONATHAN SCHMITZ, which
risk would result from publicly disclosing AMEDURE'S feelings about
SCHMITZ as solicited and requested by Defendants; and 

k. Such other acts of negligence which may be disclosed through the
discovery process. 

33. That as a direct and proximate result of the aforesaid negligence
and misconduct of the Defendants, WARNER BROS., THE JENNY JONES SHOW
and TELEPICTURES, and each of them, as set forth above, Plaintiff's
Decedent SCOTT AMEDURE suffered severe injuries, conscious pain and
suffering, and horrible death. 

34. Plaintiff's Estate is entitled to recover such damages as are
deemed to be fair and equitable under the circumstances by those

amount in excess of Twenty-five Million Dollars  ($25,000,000.00),
together with costs, interest and attorney fees  so wrongfully
incurred. 

COUNT II

Preliminary and Permanent Injunction

35. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference each and every
allegation contained in Paragraphs 1 through 34 as if state
hereinafter in full. 

36. Upon information and belief, Defendant SCHMITZ presently has no
assets from which the Plaintiff could collect any judgment awarded by
this Court. 

37. The assault resulting in the death of SCOTT AMEDURE, are the
circumstances surrounding it, have generated extreme public and media
interest. 

38. Upon information and belief, Defendant SCHMITZ are persons acting
on SCHMITZ' behalf are currently pursuing the possibility of selling
his story to the media, in exchange for significant consideration. 

39. Upon information and belief, Defendant SCHMITZ plans to use any
sums received for his personal benefit, including paying for his
defense costs in legal actions arising out of the killing. 

40. It would be against public policy and offensive t equity and good
conscious to permit Defendant SCHMITZ to benefit from his crime by
allowing him to use any sums he received for selling his story for his
personal benefit, or to fund his defense against SCOTT AMEDURE'S
family in their wrongful death action, or to fund his defense in the
criminal prosecution. 

41. Plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury unless SCHMITZ is
prevented from disposing of any monies so received before such time as
the wrongful death claim against him is resolved. SCHMITZ is allowed
to dispose of newly-acquired assets, a wrongful death judgment against
him would become a nullity plaintiffs would be unable to recover any
damages and would be without any adequate remedy at law. 

42. The Defendant SCHMITZ will not suffer any harm by having any funds
so received held by the Court until such time as the wrongful death
action may be resolved. 

43. This Court may order equitable relief when failure to maintain the
status quo would result in injustice and would violate public policy. 

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, being without remedy except in a Court of equity
prays as follows: 

A. That during the pendency of this suit, the Defendant SCHMITZ his
agents, servants, employees and attorneys and those persons in active
concert and participation with him who received notice of this Order,
be restrained and enjoined from using any money which receive from
selling, agreeing to sell, granting interviews or otherwise
disseminating information about the facts and circumstances
surrounding the killing of SCOTT AMEDURE, until such time as this
wrongful deal action has been resolved. 

B. That the Plaintiff have such other or further relief shall be
agreeable to equity and good conscience and as this Court shall deem
reasonable and proper.

           CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT

 Plaintiffs, by their undersigned attorneys, for
their Complaint herein allege as follows:

 INTRODUCTION

 1. This action is brought to enjoin violations
by each defendant of the federal antitrust laws and the
common law of torts of the various states with respect to
plaintiffs and similarly situated basketball players who
have entered and will enter into player contracts with NBA
teams, and to redress injuries sustained by plaintiffs and
similarly situated basketball players as a result of
violations by each defendant of the federal antitrust laws.
Plaintiffs are professional athletes who have been employed
by individual teams in the National Basketball Association
("NBA"). Defendants are the NBA and each of its member
teams (the "NBA Defendants"). The NBA Defendants have
jointly agreed and conspired to deny plaintiffs the ability
to market their services as professional basketball players
in a competitive market through a comprehensive set of
anticompetitive restrictions. As a result of defendants'
anticompetitive agreements, plaintiffs and other similarly
situated NBA players are prevented from receiving a
competitive market value for their services and are denied
the freedom of movement available to employees in virtually
every other industry in the United States. Although
defendants were previously held to be protected by the
nonstatutory labor exemption to the antitrust laws as long
as there was a "continuing collective bargaining
relationship," the players in the NBA have chosen to give up
their collective bargaining relationship in order to assert
their rights under the antitrust laws.

 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

 2. These claims arise and are brought under
Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C.
1, 2, and the common law of torts of the various states.

 3. This Court has jurisdiction over these claims
pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1331, 1337 and 1367.

 4. Venue in this action is proper pursuant to 28
U.S.C.  1391 and 15 U.S.C.  22. Each of the defendants
can be found, resides, has an agent, or transacts business
in the District of Minnesota, and the unlawful activities
were carried on in part by one or more of the defendants
within this district.

 THE PARTIES

 5. Plaintiff Patrick Ewing is a professional
basketball player who, since 1985, has been employed in
interstate commerce by defendant Madison Square Garden
Corporation, which owns and operates the New York
Knickerbockers. After the 1996-97 NBA season, his contract
with the Knickerbockers will expire on July 1, 1997.

 6. Plaintiff Michael Jordan is a professional
basketball player who, since 1984, has been employed in
interstate commerce by defendant Chicago Professional Sports
Limited Partnership, which owns and operates the Chicago
Bulls. After the 1995-96 NBA season, his contract with the
Chicago Bulls will expire on July 1, 1996.

 7. Plaintiff Stacey Augmon is a professional
basketball player who, since 1991, has been employed in
interstate commerce by defendant Atlanta Hawks, L.P., which
owns and operates the Atlanta Hawks. After the 1994-95 NBA
season, Mr. Augmon opted-out of his contract with the Hawks,
and is currently a free agent.

 8. Plaintiff Dale Davis is a professional
basketball player who, since 1991, has been employed in
interstate commerce by defendant Pacers Basketball
Corporation, which owns and operates the Indiana Pacers.
Mr. Davis has the right to opt-out of his contract with the
Pacers after the 1995-96 NBA season.

 9. Plaintiff Alonzo Mourning is a professional
basketball player who, since 1992, has been employed in
interstate commerce by defendant Charlotte NBA Limited
Partnership, which owns and operates the Charlotte Hornets.
Mr. Mourning is in the third year of a six year contract,
but has the right to opt-out of his contract after the 1995-
96 NBA season.

 10. Plaintiff Howard Eisley is a professional
basketball player who was selected by the Minnesota
Timberwolves as the 30th pick in the 1994 NBA draft. Mr.
Eisley was employed in interstate commerce by the Minnesota
Professional Basketball Limited Partnership, which owns and
operates the Minnesota Timberwolves, but was released by the
Timberwolves after the All-Star break. Mr. Eisley then
signed with the San Antonio Spurs and was re-released just
prior to the end of the regular season. Mr. Eisley is
currently a free agent.

 11. Plaintiff Stacey King is a professional
basketball player who, since 1989, had been employed in
interstate commerce by defendant Chicago Professional Sports
Limited Partnership, which owns and operates the Chicago
Bulls. In February of 1994, Mr. King was traded to the
Minnesota Timberwolves, which is owned and operated by
defendant Minnesota Professional Basketball Limited
Partnership. His contract with the Timberwolves having
expired, Mr. King is currently a free agent.

 12. Defendant NBA, which maintains its office at
645 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10022, is an
unincorporated association consisting of the 29 separately-
owned and operated professional basketball teams listed in
paragraph 14. The NBA is engaged in interstate commerce in
the business of, among other things, operating the sole
major league professional basketball league in North
America.

 13. The other defendants are the 29 NBA member
teams, each of which, upon information and belief, is a

 CLASS ACTION

 14. Plaintiffs Patrick Ewing, Michael Jordan,
Stacey Augmon, Dale Davis, Alonzo Mourning, Howard Eisley,
and Stacey King (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the
"class plaintiffs") are representatives of a class, as
defined by Rules 23(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure, and bring this action on behalf of
themselves and the class members as described in paragraph
17 below.

 15. The class represented by plaintiffs is
comprised of (i) all players who have been, are now, or will
be under contract to play professional basketball for an NBA
club at any time from June 28, 1995 to the date of final
judgment in this action and determination of any appeal
therefrom, and (ii) all college and other basketball players
who, as of June 28, 1995, to the date of final judgment in
this action and the determination of any appeal therefrom,
have been, are now, or will be eligible to play basketball
as a rookie for an NBA team.

 16. The class is so numerous and geographically
so widely distributed that joinder of all members is
impracticable. There are questions of law and fact common
to the class. The claims of the plaintiffs are typical of
the claims of the class they represent, and the plaintiffs
will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the
class they represent.

 17. Each person in the class is, has been, and/or
will be subject to uniform agreements, rules and practices
among the defendants restraining competition for players'
services which are or will be uniformly imposed by the NBA
Defendants.

 18. Except for provisions as to individual
compensation and other variations which do not materially
affect this action, the player contracts are substantially
identical throughout the NBA.

 19. In construing and enforcing their uniform
agreements, rules and practices, and in taking the actions
described below, the NBA Defendants have acted, have refused
to act, and will act, on grounds generally applicable to the
class, thereby making appropriate injunctive relief or
corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class
as a whole.

 20. The prosecution of separate actions by individual
members of the class would create the risk of:

   (a) inconsistent or varying adjudications
 with respect to individual members of the class
 which would establish incompatible standards of
 conduct for the party apposing the class, or

   (b) Adjudications with respect to individual
 members of the class which would as a practical
 matter be dispositive of the interests of other
 class members not parties to the adjudications or
 would substantially impair or impede the ability
 of such absent class members to protect their
 interests.

  NATURE OF INTERSTATE TRADE AND COMMERCE

 21. The primary business in which defendants are
engaged is the operation of major league professional
basketball teams and the sale of tickets and telecast rights
to the public exhibition or the individual and collective
basketball talents of players such as plaintiffs. To carry
on this business, the NBA Defendants must compete with each
other for and retain the professional services of players,
such as plaintiffs, who are signed to play basketball for
one of the NBA defendant teams.

 22. The business of major league professional
basketball is distinct from other professional sports
businesses, as well as from college and minor league
basketball. Its distinguishing features include, but are
not limited to: the rules of the sport and the season during
which it is played, the talents and rates of compensation of
the players, for whom playing basketball is their full-time
profession; the nature and amounts of trade and commerce
involved; and the unique demand for the NBA Defendants'
games by the consuming public, both as ticket purchasers and
as home viewers of and listeners to television and radio.

 23. The NBA Defendants' operation of and
engagement in the business of major league professional
basketball involves a substantial volume of interstate trade
and commerce, including, inter alia, the following
interstate activities: travel; communications; purchases and
movement of equipment; broadcasts and telecasts of league
games; advertisements; promotions; sales of tickets and
concession items; employment of players and referees; and
negotiations for all of the above.

 24. The NBA Defendants' aforesaid interstate
transactions involve collective annual expenditures and
receipts in excess of one billion dollars.

 25. The plaintiffs have been employed by and/or
are seeking new employment with one or more of the defendant
teams in interstate commerce as professional basketball
players in the NBA.

 BACKGROUND

 26. The NBA member teams constitute the only
market in the United States and North America for the
services of major league professional basketball players.
The NBA member teams are the only participants in that
market, and the only potential for competition in that
market is between the separately-owned and independently-
operated NBA teams. However, rather than engaging in
competition for the players' services, the NBA Defendants
are combining and conspiring to eliminate such competition
among themselves for the vast majority of NBA players,
including plaintiffs, through group boycotts and concerted
refusals to deal. This is accomplished by the NBA
Defendants jointly adopting and imposing "rules" and
"policies" that have the purpose and effect of preventing
players from offering their services to other NBA teams in a
competitive market when their player contracts expire, or
from renegotiating with their current team during the term
of their contracts free from unreasonable restrictions upon
those renegotiations.

 The Expired CBA

 27. In 1987, a class of professional basketball
players filed an antitrust lawsuit, Bridgeman. et al. v.
National Basketball Association. et al. (D.N.J. 87-4001),
against the NBA and its member teams challenging the
unilateral implementation of a variety of anticompetitive
restrictions, including a "salary cap." In November of
1988, the United States District Court for the District of
New Jersey approved the Bridgeman Stipulation and Settlement
Agreement ("BSA"). The BSA, along with a new collective
bargaining agreement ("CBA"), substantially modified the
anticompetitive restrictions imposed by the NBA owners, but
did not eliminate them completely. It was agreed to for a
limited period of time by the NBA class in order to provide
some relief to players during their short-lived professional
careers. By its terms, the BSA and the CBA expired on June
23, 1994 -- the day after the last playoff game of the 1994
NBA season.

 The Salary Cap System

 28. The Salary Cap contained in the BSA and CBA
was a system whereby the aggregate salaries of a team's
players were fixed at artificially low levels. A number of
exceptions were provided, but salaries were still depressed
below competitive market levels. The Salary Cap system is a
league-wide price-fixing agreement among competitors to
restrict the wages of all NBA players.

 The NBA Draft

 29. The BSA and CBA also included a so-called
"NBA Draft," which has the purpose and effect of dividing
the market for the most wanted first year, or "rookie,"
player services among the NBA clubs who would otherwise
compete against each other for those players. Under the NBA
Draft, each NBA team is given the right, pursuant to certain
rules and procedures, to choose specific college and other
rookie players with whom the team will have the exclusive
NBA negotiating rights. If a rookie player for any reason
does not wish to sign a contract with or play for the NBA
team which "owns" the rights to him, he may not negotiate
with or play for any other NBA club.

 30. The allocation of negotiating rights
effectuated by the NBA Draft is enforced by a group boycott
and agreement among the NBA Defendants. This group boycott
and agreement takes the form of a concerted refusal to deal
with potential NBA players except through restrictive
anticompetitive practices.

 Restricted Free Agency

 31. The BSA and CBA also included a number of
other anticompetitive restrictions, including restrictions
on the ability of NBA players with less than four years
of NBA experience to market themselves as free agents.
These players were subject to an anticompetitive "Right of
First Refusal" by their previous team.

 The Williams Case And The Continuation Of
The Salary Cap System During The 1994-1995 NBA Season

 32. On June 17, 1994, the NBA filed a lawsuit
against 17 NBA players in the U.S. District Court For The
Southern District of New York, seeking a declaratory
judgment that continued implementation by the NBA and its
teams of the Salary Cap, the NBA Draft, and the so-called
"Right of First Refusal" do not violate the antitrust laws.
National Basketball Association v. Williams, No. 94 Civ.
4488 (KTD) (S.D.N.Y.).

 33. On June 27, 1994, a group of then-current and
prospective NBA players counterclaimed in the Williams
action, alleging that the continued implementation of the
Salary Cap and the Right of First Refusal, and the holding
and subsequent enforcement of the 1994 NBA Draft, violated
Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, even while the NBA and
the National Basketball Players Association ("NBPA")
continued to negotiate over a potential new CBA. The NBPA
was then the recognized collective bargaining representative
of players who are employed as professional basketball
players by NBA teams. The counterclaims in the Williams
action sought injunctive relief on behalf of the
counterclaim-plaintiffs and an unspecified class, and
damages on behalf of the individual defendants/counterclaim-
plaintiffs. The counterclaims in the Williams action did
not seek relief for any class-wide damages.

 34. on July 1, 1994, Judge Kevin T. Duffy was
assigned the Williams case, and a hearing was conducted on
Friday, July 8, 1994. At the hearing, Judge Duffy informed
the parties that a preliminary injunction hearing that the
counterclaim-plaintiffs had requested would be consolidated
with a one-day trial on the merits, which "trial" was
conducted four days later, with no pre-trial discovery, on
Tuesday, July 12, 1994.

 35. At the "trial," counsel for the NBPA and the
counterclaim-plaintiffs stated that he had no objection to
certification of a class. However, no notice was provided
to the class members prior to that date, or at any other
time in the Williams action.

 36. On July 18, 1994, the district court in
Williams held that the non-statutory labor exemption to the
antitrust laws continued to shield restraints previously
agreed to in an expired CBA from the antitrust laws until
there was no longer a collective bargaining relationship
between the parties. In its opinion, the Williams district
court stated as follows:

 Antitrust immunity exists as long as a collective
bargaining relationship exists. Accordingly, the
NBA is granted the declaration it seeks -- the
continued implementation of these challenged
measures by the NBA do not violate the antitrust
laws as long as the collective bargaining
relationship exists.

 This does not mean that the Players are
"stuck" with these provisions forever. Certainly,
they can attempt to bargain these provisions away
-- including exerting economic pressure by means
of a strike. Or the Players may request
decertification of the NBPA as a collective
bargaining agent. I do not mean by this ruling to
encourage the Players to decertify their union so
that they may bring an antitrust claim. But,
decertification is certainly an option the Players
have. In fact, this is exactly what the National
Football League Players Union did following Powell
II.

 National Basketball Ass'n v. Williams, 857 F. Supp. 1069,
1078 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) (citations omitted) (emphasis added).

 37. On July 21, 1994, the Williams district court
entered judgment in that action. The Judgment stated that
the action was thereby certified as a class action pursuant
to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1) and (b)(2) on behalf of and
against a class of NBA players and prospective NBA players
who were defined as follows:

 (1) all basketball players who were, are or will
be under contract to a team in the NBA from the
date of formal expiration of the 1988 Collective
Bargaining Agreement through the date of final
judgment in this action; and (2) all college and
other basketball athletes who, from the date of
formal expiration of the 1988 Collective
Bargaining Agreement through the date of a final
judgment in this action, were, are or will be
eligible under the Constitution and By-Laws of the
NBA to play basketball for an NBA team .

 The Judgment stated "that the NBA's continued implementation
of the college draft, right of first refusal and salary cap
does not violate the antitrust laws as long as it is
implemented as part of a continuing collective bargaining
relationship." (Emphasis added).

 38. On January 24, 1995, the Second Circuit
affirmed the Williams decision, on the basis that the NBA
players had to end their collective bargaining relationship,
if they wanted to pursue their antitrust rights. 45 F.3d
684 (2d Cir. 1995).

 The "No Lockout/No Strike Agreement"

 39. on October 27, 1994, the NBPA and the NBA
executed an agreement pursuant to which, from that date
until the earlier of the day of the last game of the 1995
NBA Finals or the date upon which a "successor collective
bargaining agreement" is executed, the NBA agreed not to
engage in a lockout of the NBPA, and the NBPA agreed not to
engage in "any strikes, cessations or stoppages of work, or
any other similar interference with the operations of the
NBA." The agreement also included a moratorium on player
signings. Upon information and belief, the No Lockout/No
Strike Agreement was subsequently extended by the NBPA and
the NBA to July 1, 1995.

 The Negotiations And The Proposed New Collective
Bargaining Agreement Between The NBPA And The NBA

 40. In and before June 1995, the NBPA and the NBA
engaged in negotiations over the terms of a potential new
collective bargaining agreement. During the course of those
negotiations, numerous players asked the Executive Director
of the NBPA to disclose the potential terms that were being
discussed with the NBA. The Executive Director refused to
disclose those terms.

 41. During this same period, from media reports
and other sources, numerous NBA players became aware of the
terms of a new collective bargaining agreement that had been
negotiated between the NBA and the NBPA Executive Director.
The NBA players learned that the agreement would include
onerous terms that were substantially worse and even more
anticompetitive than the terms of the old BSA and CBA.

 42. On June 21, 1995, NBA players received a
memorandum from the President and Executive Director of the
NBPA. Upon information and belief, the shipping costs of
this mailing, approximately $50,000, was paid by the NBA.
The memorandum stated that "we finally have reached an
agreement in principle on the terms of a new six-year
collective bargaining agreement," and had attached to it a
five page "outline" that the memorandum stated "sets forth
virtually all the proposed terms of this deal." A copy of
that outline is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

 43. The President and Executive Director of the
NBPA also stated in the memorandum that the NBPA's 27 player
representatives would be meeting the next day in Chicago,
"so that they may vote on whether they accept our
recommendation to ratify this deal." (Two of the 29 NBA
teams, Toronto and Vancouver, are new expansion teams, and
do not yet have player representatives). The Executive
Director confirmed in media reports that the new CBA would
not be submitted to the players for a ratification vote, and
that the CBA would be ratified and go into effect if
approved by 21 player representatives the day after the
"outline" of the deal was distributed. Upon information and
belief, not submitting the new CBA to a ratification vote by
all the NBA players was unprecedented, as all prior CBA's in
the NBA were voted on by all NBA players.

 44. Numerous players opposed to the conduct of
the NBPA in its negotiations with the NBA attended the June
22 player meeting in Chicago. At that meeting, the player
representatives attending the meeting voted to table the CBA
that had been presented to them for ratification.

 The Decertification Of The NBPA

 45. On June 21, 1995, the day before the Chicago
meeting, seventeen NBA players filed a petition with the
National Labor Relations Board requesting that an election
be held to "decertify" the NBPA as the collective bargaining
representative of NBA players. In support of the petition,
statements signed by more than 30% of the collective
bargaining unit renouncing the authority of the NBPA were
submitted to the NLRB within 48 hours of the filing of the
petition.

 46. During the past week, NBA players continued
to sign decertification petitions despite the vociferous
opposition of the NBPA's Executive Director and a few of its
officers. On June 28, 1995, the petitioning players
notified the NBA and the NBPA that more than 50% of the
bargaining unit had signed petitions renouncing the
authority of the NBPA to collectively bargain on their
behalf, and copies of those petitions were delivered to the
NBA and NBPA. As a result, because the NBPA is a
voluntarily "recognized" union, rather than a "certified"
union, the NBPA may no longer be voluntarily recognized by
the NBA as having the authority to collectively bargain on
behalf of NBA players, and any collective bargaining
relationship with the NBA has ended. The NBA players no
longer want to engage in, and are no longer represented in,
collective bargaining with the NBA.

 47. As a result, as of July 28, 1995, there is no
collective bargaining representative to shield (under any
ruling) the NBA Defendants' anticompetitive restraints from
antitrust review.

 The NBA's Continued Imposition Of Anticompetitive
Restrictions Upon NBA Players

 48. The NBA and its teams have announced that
they will hold the 1995 NBA Draft on June 28. On July 1,
1995, all player contracts that do not extend beyond the
1994-95 NBA Season will expire. Upon information and
belief, on and after July 1, 1995, the NBA and its member
teams will continue to enforce the market division rules of
the NBA Draft, and will also do one or more of the
following: (i) implement a claimed "lockout" prohibiting
all player signings or player employment; (ii) impose a
system of anticompetitive restraints on player movement,
salaries, and contract signings substantially similar to the
anticompetitive restrictions agreed to in the proposed CBA
that was rejected by the players; or (iii) impose a system
of anticompetitive restraints on player movement, salaries,
and contract signings substantially similar to the terms of
the prior CBA.

 49. Any "lockout" on player signings by the NBA
and its member teams would be an illegal group boycott in
violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, under both the
per se rule and the rule of reason standard. Any imposition
of a system of restraints substantially similar to the old
CBA or the restrictions in the proposed CBA would be an
illegal restraint of trade in violation of the Sherman Act.

 COUNT I

 Section 1 of the Sherman Act

 50. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the
allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 49.

 51. There is a relevant market for the services
of major league professional basketball players in North
America, and a relevant submarket in the United States. The
restrictions imposed by the NBA Defendants substantially
restrain and injure competition in these markets.

 52. The restrictions imposed by the NBA
Defendants constitute an agreement among competitors to
suppress competition for the services of major league
professional basketball players in North America and the
United States, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.
This system operates as a perpetual horizontal group boycott
and/or horizontal division of markets, which constitutes an
unreasonable restraint of trade. Each of the NBA Defendants
is a participant in this unlawful combination or conspiracy.

 53. The purpose and effect of the anticompetitive
restrictions is to suppress the market for player services
and earn monopoly profits for the NBA owners. No
procompetitive purpose is furnished by these restrictions.

 54. The plaintiffs and class members have
suffered and will suffer antitrust injury to their business
or property by reason of the continuation of this unlawful
combination or conspiracy. The restrictions imposed by the
NBA Defendants injure plaintiffs and class members by
depriving them of the ability to offer their services as
professional basketball players to the teams of their choice
in a free and open market upon first entering the NBA as
rookie players and upon expiration of their player
contracts. This causes them to receive salaries that are
substantially lower than they would have received in the
absence of those restrictions. Veteran players are also
hurt by the NBA draft, which has the effect of lowering the
salaries of all NBA players.

 55. Plaintiffs and class members face threatened
loss or damage by reason of defendants' continued violation
of the antitrust laws when their present contracts expire.

 COUNT II

 Section 2 of the Sherman Act

 56. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each of the
allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 49.

 57. There is a relevant market for the services
of major league professional basketball players in North
America, and a relevant submarket in the United States. The
restrictions imposed by the NBA Defendants substantially
restrain and injure competition in these markets.

 58. Defendants possess monopoly power in the
markets for the services of major league professional
basketball players in North America and the United States.

 59. The restrictions imposed by the NBA
Defendants are willfully intended to help defendants acquire
and maintain their monopoly power in the market for the
services of major league professional basketball players in
North America and the United States, in violation of Section
2 of the Sherman Act, by operating as a perpetual horizontal
group boycott and/or horizontal division of markets.

 60. The plaintiffs and class members have
suffered and will suffer antitrust injury to their business
or property by reason of the restrictions imposed by the NBA
Defendants. This system injures plaintiffs and class
members by depriving them of the ability to offer their
services as professional basketball players to the teams of
their choice in a free and open market upon first entering
the NBA as rookie players and upon expiration of their
player contracts. This causes them to receive salaries that
are substantially lower than they would have received in the
absence of those restrictions.

 61. Plaintiffs and class members face threatened
loss or damage by reason of defendants' continued violation
of the antitrust laws when their present contracts expire.

 COUNT III

 Tortious Interference With Prospective Contracts

 62. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege the
allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 49.

 63. By implementing the aforesaid restrictions
defendants intentionally interfere with plaintiffs' and
class members' rights to enter into prospective contracts
with NBA clubs other than their prior clubs. Absent these
restrictions, plaintiffs and class members would enter into
contracts with other NBA clubs.

 64. The aforesaid conduct violates the antitrust
laws, the common law of torts of the various states, and is
intended to harm the players, and earn monopoly profits for
the NBA owners, by suppressing the market for player
services.

 65. Plaintiffs and class members will be
deprived, by reason of the restrictions imposed by the NBA
Defendants, of the ability to negotiate and obtain more
favorable contract terms, and will receive compensation
substantially less than they would have received if they
were not prevented from entering into contracts with other
NBA teams. Absent such restrictions imposed by the NBA
Defendants, the plaintiffs and class members would be free
to offer their services to other NBA teams in a competitive
market. Plaintiffs and class members will suffer severe and
irreparable harm if they are prevented from offering their
services to other NBA teams in a competitive market.

 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

 WHEREFORE, plaintiffs pray for judgment with
respect to their Complaint as follows:

 1.   Declaring that, as of June 28, 1995, the
restrictions imposed by the NBA Defendants violate  1 and
2 of the Sherman Act:

 2.   Declaring that, as of June 28, 1995, the
restrictions imposed by the NBA Defendants constitute a
tortious interference with prospective contracts;

 3. Enjoining defendants from implementing or
enforcing those restrictions, or any similar restrictions,
which would prevent or restrict rookie players from freely
negotiating or entering into contracts with any NBA club,
and which would prevent or restrict veteran players from
freely negotiating or entering into contracts with any NBA
club after their existing contracts expire;

 4. Awarding plaintiffs and the class they
represent treble the amount of damages they sustained as a
result of the violations of the antitrust laws alleged
herein:

 5. Awarding plaintiffs and the class they
represent the damages they sustained as a result of
defendants' interference with their entering into
prospective contracts;

 6. Enjoining defendants from implementing or
enforcing the restrictions imposed by the NBA Defendants, or
any similar restrictions which would interfere with the
prospective contracts of plaintiffs and the class they
represent with other NBA teams;

 7. Awarding plaintiffs and the class they
represent their costs and disbursements in this action,
including reasonable attorneys' fees;

 8. Granting plaintiffs and the class they
represent such other and further relief as may be
appropriate.

NO. CV 91-2158 AWT

JURY INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN

The instructions hereto are the instructions given to the jury on
this date. A copy of these instructions has been provided to the
jury.

 Dated: AUG 12 1993

 A. WALLACE TASH~~~IMA
 United States District Judge

 AWT - Revised 5/91

 GENERAL CIVIL INSTRUCTIONS

 Members of the Jury:

 Now that you have heard the evidence and the argument of
counsel, it becomes my duty to instruct you on the law that
applies to this case.

 1. Function of the Jury. It is now your duty to find the facts
from all the evidence in the case. You are the sole judges of
the facts. However, it is your duty to follow and to apply the
law as stated in these instructions, whether you agree with it
or not. You must follow all of the instructions and not single
out some and ignore others; they are all equally important.

 You must not be influenced by any personal likes or dislikes,
sympathy, prejudice or public opinion. You are to perform your
sworn duty without bias or prejudice for or against any party.
Remember that you took an oath promising to do so at the
beginning of the case.

 2. Judging Witnesses. In deciding what the facts are, you must
consider all the evidence. In doing this, you must decide which
testimony to believe and which testimony not to believe. You may
disbelieve all or any part of any witness testimony. In making
that decision, you may take into account a number of factors
including the following:

 1. Was the witness able to see, or hear, or know the things
about which that witness testified?

 2. How well was the witness able to recall and describe those
things?

 3. What was the witness's manner while testifying?

 4. Did the witness have an interest in the outcome of this case
or any bias or prejudice concerning any party or any matter
involved in the case?

 5. How reasonable was the witness's testimony considered in
light of all the evidence in the case?

 6. Was the witness's testimony contradicted by what the witness
has said or done at another time, or by the testimony of other
witnesses, or by other evidence.

 In deciding whether or not to believe a witness, keep in mind
that people sometimes forget things. You need to consider
therefore whether a contradiction is an innocent lapse of memory
or an intentional falsehood, and that may depend on whether it
has to do with an important fact or with only a small detail.

 The weight of the evidence presented by each side does not
necessarily depend on the number of witnesses testifying on one
side or the other. You must consider all of the evidence in the
case, and you may decide that the testimony of a smaller number
of witnesses on one side has greater weight than that of larger
number on the other.

 All of these are matters for you to consider in finding the
facts.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 3

 [Charts and Summaries Received in Evidence]

 Certain charts and summaries have been received into evidence to
illustrate facts brought out in the testimony of some witnesses.
Charts and summaries are only as good as the underlying evidence
that supports them. You should therefore given them only such
weight as you think the underlying evidence deserves.

 3A. Deposition for Impeachment. Prior to the trial, the
deposition was taken of a witness and part of it was read into
evidence. If, in said deposition, the witness made any
statements in conflict with his [or her] testimony in Court, you
may consider such conflicts and any explanations therefor in
determining his [or her] credibility as if the testimony in the
deposition had been given at trial.

 INSTRUCTION 4A

 A corporation under the law is a person, but it can only act
through its employees, agents, directors, or officers. The law
therefore holds a corporation responsible for the acts of its
employees, agents, directors, and officers, if but only if those
acts are authorized. An act is authorized if it is a part of the
ordinary course of employment of the person doing it. Whether a
particular act was authorized is question you must decide on the
evidence.

 The fact that defendant is a corporation should not affect your
decision. All persons are equal before the law, and
corporations, whether large or small, are entitled to the same
fair and conscientious consideration by you as any other person.

 4. Evidence in the Case. You are to decide the case solely on
the evidence received at the trial. The evidence consists of the
sworn testimony of all witnesses, all exhibits received in
evidence and all facts which have been agreed to or stipulated.

 Anything you may have seen or heard outside the courtroom is not
evidence.

 A question is never evidence except as it supplies meaning to
its answer.

 5. Statements of Counsel. Statements, questions and arguments of
counsel are not evidence, except for any statement of a
stipulation.

 6. Stipulation. A stipulation is an agreed statement of facts
between the attorneys, and you must accept such facts as being
conclusively proved.

 7. Objections. When the Court has sustained an objection to a
question, you must not speculate as to what the answer might
have been or the reason for the objection.

 If any testimony was stricken by the Court or you have been
instructed to disregard it, it is not evidence and must not be
considered.

 8. Opinion of the Court. Do not assume that I hold any opinion
on any matter in this case- You are at liberty to disregard all
comments of the Court, except my instructions of the law.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 11

 FAILURE TO PRODUCE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE

 If a party fails to produce evidence which is under his control
and reasonably available to him, then you may infer that the
evidence is unfavorable to the party who could have produced it
and did not.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 12

 WILFUL SUPPRESSION OF EVIDENCE

 If you find that a party wilfully suppressed evidence in order
to prevent its being presented in this trial, you may consider
that fact in determining what inferences to draw from the
evidence.

 16. Direct or Circumstantial Evidence. There are two kinds of
evidence from which you may find the truth of the facts of a
case. One is direct evidence -- such as the testimony evidence
or of an eyewitness. The other is circumstantial indirect
evidence -- the proof of a chain of facts from which you could
find that another fact exists, even though it has not been
proven by direct evidence. You should consider both kinds of
evidence. It is for you to decide how much weight to give to any
evidence.

 17. Inferences. You are not limited in your consideration of the
evidence to the bare words of the witnesses. You are authorized
to draw such inferences as are justified in the light of your
experience as reasonable persons. An inference is a deduction or
conclusion which reason and common sense lead one to draw from
proved facts.

 18. Expert Testimony. You have heard testimony from person(s)
referred to as expert(s). A person who by education or
experience has gained special knowledge in a field may give his
[or her] opinion on matters in that field and may also state
their reasons for the opinion.

 Such testimony should be judged just like any other testimony.
You may accept it or reject it, and give it as much weight as
you think it deserves, considering the witness' education and
experience, the reasons given for the opinion, and all other
evidence in the case.

 25. Burden of Proof - Preponderance of the Evidence. In a civil
case such as this the plaintiff has the burden of proving the
case by what is called the "preponderance of the evidence." That
means that the plaintiff has to produce evidence which,
considered in the light of all the facts, leads you to believe
that what the plaintiff claims is more likely true than not
true. To state it differently, if you were to put plaintiff's
and defendant's evidence on opposite sides of the scales,
plaintiff would have to make the scales tip slightly in
plaintiff's favor. If plaintiff fails to meet this burden, the
verdict must be for defendant.

 On the other hand, the defendant has the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence any affirmative defenses asserted
by defendant.

 Therefore, when I say in these instructions that a party must
"prove" or "show" or "establish," or that the jury may "find,"
mean that the proposition must be proven by a preponderance of
all of the evidence in the case.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 28

 [Separate Analysis of Each Sound Recording]

 In analyzing the various claims and defenses asserted in this
action, each of the sound recordings at issue, that is, the four
sound recordings known as I Need You, Opposites Attract,
Knocked Out and State of Attraction, along with the album sound
recording, Forever Your Girl, shall be considered separately,
unless I instruct you otherwise .

 INSTRUCTION NO. 31

 Parties' Contentions (First Two Claims)

 Plaintiff Yvette Marine (called "Marine") contends that she
recorded lead vocal performances on two sound recordings known as
I Need You and Opposites Attract; that her lead vocals on those
two sound recordings were mixed together with those of another
performer, Paula Abdul; that defendant Virgin Records America,
Inc. (called "Virgin") utilized Marine's vocals on copies of
these recordings sold to consumers throughout the world; that
Virgin caused the credits for I Need You and Opposites Attract
to identify only Paula Abdul as the lead vocalist, and that
Virgin's credits for I Need You and Opposites Attract were
false, deceptive or at least likely to confuse the public by
inaccurately stating that Marine's only contributions to them
were background vocals.

 Virgin, on the other hand, denies that Marine's vocal
performances on these two recordings constituted a "lead" vocal,
and that its credits correctly identified all "lead" vocalists.

 Marine contends that she sustained damages because she was not
credited as one of the lead vocalists on I Need You and
Opposites Attract.

 Virgin, on the other hand, contends that since Marine was only
one of the background vocalists on I Need You and Opposites
Attract, she did not sustain any damages by virtue of Virgin's
credits for these two recordings.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 32

 There is no claim being made that Marine was improperly credited
on the recordings Knocked Out and State of Attraction.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 33

 Marine's first claim is that Virgin violated 43(a) of the
Lanham Act, which prohibits the use of any false designation of
origin on goods sold in interstate commerce. In order to prove
this claim, Marine must establish each of the following:

 First, that Marine's vocal contribution to I Need You and
Opposites Attract constituted a "lead" or "co-lead"
contribution.

 Second, that Virgin did not give Marine credit for her vocal
contribution.

 Third that Marine was injured by Virgin's actions.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 34

 Marine also claims that the actions of Virgin in crediting
only--one vocalist, namely, Paula Abdul, for I Need You and
Opposites Attract constitutes "unfair competition" under
California law.

 Liability for unfair competition is very similar to that for
violation of 43(a) of the Lanham Act in that unfair competition
involves mislabeling or failure to credit a person for their
efforts or contributions to a product (such as a sound
recording) when those of others are credited as if they were the
sole contributors.

 One form of unfair competition is called "reverse passing off."
This occurs when the efforts or contributions of one person are
labeled as the efforts of another. This is what Marine contends
Virgin did with respect to the packaging credits for Need You
and Opposites Attract.

 Accordingly, in order for you to determine whether Virgin
committed unfair competition with its packaging credits for I
Need You and Opposites Attract, you must decide whether Virgin
diverted credit for Marine's vocal performances to another
vocalist.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 35

 Virgin has raised the affirmative defense of "estoppel" to
Marine's claims under the Lanham Act and the California unfair
competition law. To the extent that Virgin proves this defense,
Virgin would not be liable for any conduct to which the defense
applies.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 36

 UNFAIR COMPETITION - DEFENSES - ESTOPPEL

 "Estoppel" means that MARINE cannot now complain of a condition
that she knew about and went along with, where VIRGIN was not
aware that she disagreed with it, and had reason to expect that
MARINE would tell them if she disapproved. MARINE's silence
alone will not create an estoppel; for estoppel to arise,
silence must occur under such circumstances that it would be
reasonable for VIRGIN to rely on her silence.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 37

 To establish the defense of estoppel, Virgin must prove each of
the following elements:

 1. Marine knew of the facts which constitute the basis of her
claims under the Lanham Act and the California unfair
competition law.

 2. Virgin did not know that Marine objected to the manner in
which the Forever Your Girl album was packaged and the manner in
which credits were given on said album.

 3. Virgin was justified in believing that Marine's failure meant
that Marine did not object.

 4. Virgin relied upon Marine's failure to object in continuing
to market the Forever Your Girl album in the manner in which it
was marketed.

 If you find that Virgin has established this defense, your
verdict should be for Virgin on the Lanham Act and state unfair
competition claims.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 38

 ACTS AND OMISSIONS BY AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES

 One is the agent of another person or company (called the
"principal"), if, at a given time, he or she is authorized to
act for or in place of such person or company. Accordingly, any
act or omission of any of MARINE's agents was the act or
omission of MARINE. Similarly, any act or omission of any of
VIRGIN's agents was the act or omission of VIRGIN.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 41

 [Damages for Violation of 43(a)]

 The Lanham Act provides two forms of damages or monetary
recovery to which Marine is entitled if she shows that Virgin
violated section 43(a). They are:

 (1) Any actual damages or lost profits which Marine sustained as
the result of Virgin's improper failure to credit her vocal
contributions, or,

 (2) Virgin's profits from the sale of the sound recordings which
bear the improper packaging credits.

 In determining what Virgin's profits are, Marine has the burden
of producing evidence of Virgin's income from the sale of the
sound recordings, and Virgin then has the burden of proving any
deductible expenses., and of proving what proportion, if any, of
its total profits were the result of the efforts of persons
other than Marine, including Paula Abdul.

 With respect to income from the sale of the album Forever Your
Girl, Marine must prove what proportion, if any, of the total
income from that album is attributable to the songs in issue.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 42

 [Damages for Unfair Competition]

 Marine may recover two similar forms of damages if she shows
that Virgin committed unfair competition. They are:

 (1) Any losses she sustained which were legally caused by
Virgin's actions; in this context, "legal cause" means that
Virgin's acts of unfair competition were a substantial factor in
bringing about Marine's loss or harm, and,

 (2) Virgin's profits.

 In determining Virgin's profits, Marine has the burden of
producing evidence of Virgin's income and Virgin then has the
burden of proving any deductible expenses. in accordance with
the instruction I have just given you.

    INSTRUCTION NO. 43

  As just stated, Marine seeks an award of Virgin's profits
from its sales of the sound recordings and of the album
containing those sound recordings. Before Marine may recover
Virgin's profits under the Lanham Act, she must prove that
Virgin willfully violated the Act.

  An act is done "willfully" if it is done knowingly,
deliberately and intentionally (done "on purpose"), and not
accidentally or carelessly or unintentionally.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 44

 Before Marine may recover Virgin's profits under the California
unfair competition law, she must prove that Virgin' unfair
competition was willful, that is, that Virgin intentionally and
deliberately passed off Marine's lead vocal contribution to the
sound recordings in issue as being those solely of Paula Abdul.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 45

 Virgin claims that even if Marine has proven her Lanham Act or
unfair competition claims, she is not entitled to any monetary
recovery because she did not mitigate her damages.

 An individual damaged by the wrongful acts of another has duty
to use reasonable care and diligence to avoid loss and to
minimize her damages.

 In order to prove its defense of failure to mitigate damages,
Virgin must establish that there were reasonable measures that
Marine could have taken which would have avoided or minimized
her damages and that she failed to take such measures.

 If you find that Marine failed to exercise reasonable diligence
and reasonable care to take measures which would have prevented
or minimized her damages, then you are to reduce her Lanham Act
or unfair competition damage award to the extent that she could
have mitigated her losses.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 46

 SPECULATIVE DAMAGES

 You are not permitted to award any speculative damages, which
means compensation for future loss or harm which, although
possible, is conjectural or not reasonably certain. However, if
you determine that either party is entitled to recover, you
should compensate that party for loss or harm which is
reasonably certain to be suffered by that party in the future as
a proximate result of the injury in question.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 47

 The fact that I have instructed you on damages should not be
taken as any indication of the court as to what the jury's
verdict should be on the issue of liability.

 It is the jury's function to decide the issue of liability. have
instructed you on the proper measure of damages for your
guidance only in the event that you decide that the plaintiff is
entitled to recover.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 51

 [The Parties' Contentions (Fourth Count)]

 Marine claims that she, along with Paula Abdul and the record
producers, are the creators and authors of the sound recordings
known as I Need You, Opposites Attract, Knocked Out, State of
Attraction and Forever Your Girl, and as such, Marine is one of
the co-owners of the copyrights in these sound recordings.
Marine also contends that she was self-employed and not an
employee of anyone else when she made her vocal contributions to
the sound recordings.

 Virgin, on the other hand, contends (1 ) that Marine was an
employee working in the course of her employment with Virgin
and/or the producers when she made her vocal contributions to I
Need You, Opposites Attract, Knocked Out and State of Attraction
and, therefore, Virgin is the sole owner of the copyrights in
these sound recordings; and, (2) that even if Marine was not so
employed, she does not meet the requirements for joint
authorship and, therefore, cannot be a co-owner of the
copyrights in these sound recordings.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 52

 [Subject Matter of Copyright Protection; Sound Recordings]

 The United States Copyright Act, Section 102,  provides
that:

 "Copyright protection subsists . . . in original works of
authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known
or later developed .... Works of authorship include ... sound
recordings. . . "

 As defined in the Copyright Act, sound recordings are the works
which contain the sounds that you hear when, for example, you
play or listen to phonorecords, audio cassettes and record
albums.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 53

 The Copyright Act states that "copyright in a work protected
under this title vests initially in the author or authors of the
work. The authors of a joint work are co-owners of the copyright
in the work."

 "Authors," within the meaning of the Copyright Act, are those
who contribute "copyrightable expression" to a tangible work of
authorship, such as a sound recording.

 Copyrightable expression in a sound recording includes the
performers' creative expression and the contribution of the
producers in capturing and processing of the sounds.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 54

 ["Works Made for Hire"]

 The Copyright Act defines a "work made for hire" as:

 "a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her
employment."

 In order to determine whether Marine's vocal contributions to I
Need You, Opposites Attract, Knocked Out and State of Attraction
were "works made for hire" within the meaning of the Copyright
Act, you must determine whether Marine was an employee acting
within the scope of her employment at the time the recordings
were made.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 55

 WORK FOR HIRE - AUTHOR

 When the work is made "for hire", the employer or other person
for whom the work was prepared is the author, and thus the
owner, of the copyright in the work. An "employee" is not the
copyright owner.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 56

 Marine has the burden of showing that she was not an employee of
Virgin or any of the sound recordings' producers, working within
the course and scope of such employment when she rendered her
vocal contributions to I Need You, Opposites Attract, Knocked
Out and/or State of Attraction.

 In determining whether a hired party is an employee, you must
consider the hiring party's right to control the manner and
means by which the product is accomplished. Among other factors
relevant to this inquiry are:

 (a) The skill required;

 (b) The source of the instrumentalities and tools;

 (c) The location of the work;

 (d) The duration of the relationship between the parties;

 (e) Whether the hiring party has the right to assign additional
projects to the hired party;

 (f) The extent of the hired party's discretion over when and how
long to work;

 (g) The method of payment;

 (h) The hired party's role in hiring and paying assistants;

 (i) Whether the work is part of the regular business of the
hiring party;

 (j) Whether the hiring party is in business;

 (k) The provision of employee benefits; and

 (l) The tax treatment of the hired party.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 57

 The burden of proof as to Virgin's sole ownership of the
copyright for the Forever Your Girl sound recording rests with
Virgin. However, Virgin's certificate of copyright registration
for that recording is what is called "prima facie evidence" of
its sole ownership of the copyright in that album, including the
facts stated in the certificate.

 In other words, Virgin's certificate establishes a presumption
of its sole ownership of the copyright. However, if you find
that Marine has produced evidence which, in your mind, rebuts
the statements in Virgin's copyright certificate, Virgin cannot
rely on the presumption alone to prove its sole ownership.
Rather, in such event, you must then determine whether Virgin
has carried its burden of proving its sole ownership of the
copyright in each of the individual sound recordings at issue
here, namely Opposites Attract, I Need You, Knocked Out and
State of Attraction, and in the album Forever Your Girl.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 58

 [Joint Works of Authorship]

 The Copyright Act defines a "joint work of authorship" as a work
prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their
contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts
of a unitary whole.

 The essence of joint authorship is a joint laboring in
furtherance of preconcerted common design. This does not mean,
however, that joint authors must work in physical proximity or
in concert. Nor is an express "collaboration agreement"
necessary to create a joint-author relationship.

 Moreover, the respective contributions of joint authors need not
be equal either quantitatively or qualitatively. It is
sufficient if each author contributes more than minimal amount
of creative work to the joint work.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 59

 [Joint Authors]

 In order to establish that she a joint author of the I Need You,
Opposites Attract, Knocked Out, State of Attraction and/or the
Forever Your Girl album sound recordings, Marine must show the
following:

 (1) That she contributed copyrightable material (i.e., an
individual creative effort, such as a recorded vocal
performance) to the claimed joint work;

 (2) That her vocal contributions were "fixed" (i.e., embodied in
a record or audio tape) by or under her authority (i.e., with
her authorization or permission);

 (3) That her vocal contributions to each of the sound recordings
were more than merely minimal relative to those of the other
individual authors of the sound recordings, namely, Abdul and
the producers; and,

 (4) That she and the producers intended that their respective
contributions, along with Abdul's, be merged, combined or
absorbed into an integrated work at the time each of the sound
recordings was created .

 In determining whether Marine has established that her vocal
contributions to the sound recordings were sufficient to qualify
her as a joint author, or, on the other hand, as Virgin
contends, are only "de minimus," you are to assess the relative
contribution of Marine's vocals, as compared to the contribution
of other vocalists.

 You need not decide the issue of joint authorship if you find
that Marine was an employee of Virgin,or others who assigned
their interests to Virgin, in accordance with the earlier
instruction.

 INSTRUCTION NO. 60

 [Joint Author's Right to an Accounting]

 Each co-owner of a copyright has a right to exploit the work
freely, independently of the other owners. However, each joint
author also has an obligation to account to his or her co-owners
for their share of any income derived from their joint work.

 Unless there is an express agreement signed by the authors of a
joint work to apportion income from the work, it is divided
equally among the authors, even if their contributions to the
joint work were not equal.

 In addition, if you find that Abdul and/or the producers
assigned or sold their copyright interests in the sound
recordings to Virgin, then Virgin is obligated to account to
Marine for her share, if any, of any income earned from the
exploitation of the sound recording copyrights, commencing on
the date Virgin acquired its interest in the copyrights.

 91. Jury's Recollection Controls. If any reference by the Court
or by counsel to matters of evidence does not coincide with your
own recollection, it is your recollection which should control
during your deliberations.

 92. Individual Opinion. The verdict must represent the
considered judgment of each juror and each juror must agree to
it. In other words, your verdict must be unanimous. It is your
duty to consult with one another, and to deliberate with a view
to reaching an agreement, if you can do so without violence to
individual judgment.

 Each of you must decide the case for yourself, but you should do
so only after you have considered all of the evidence, discussed
it fully with the other jurors and listened to the views of your
fellow jurors.

 In the course of your deliberations, do not hesitate to
reexamine your own views, and change your opinion, if the
discussion convinces you that you should. But do not surrender
your honest conviction as to the weight or effect of evidence or
come to a decision simply because other jurors think it is right
or simply to reach a verdict.

 Remember that you are not partisans. You are the impartial
judges of the facts. Your sole interest is to ascertain the
truth from the evidence in the case.

 93. Communications Between Court and Jury. If it becomes
necessary to communicate with the Court, you may send a note by
a bailiff, signed by any member of the jury. You should never
attempt to communicate by any means other than a signed writing.
The Court will communicate with you on any matter concerning the
case only in writing, or here in open court.

 You will note from the oath about to be taken by the bailiffs
that they are forbidden to communicate with any member of the
jury on any subject touching the merits of the case.

 You are never to reveal -- not even to the Court -- how the jury
stands, numerically or otherwise, [on any question submitted to
you] until after you have reached your verdict.

 94. Verdict - Jury's Responsibility. It is proper to add the
caution that nothing said in these instructions - nothing in any
form of verdict prepared for your convenience - is to suggest or
convey in any way or manner any intimation as to what verdict I
think you should find. What the verdict shall be is sole and
exclusive duty and responsibility of the jury.

 95. Foreperson; Returning Verdict. Upon retiring to the Jury
Room, you will select one of your number to act as your
foreperson. That person will preside over your deliberations,
and will speak for you in Court.

 A form of verdict has been prepared for your use. This form will
be sent into the Jury Room, at which time you will commence your
deliberations. When you have reached your verdict, you will have
your foreperson fill in, date and sign the form to state the
verdict upon which you unanimously agree, and then return with
it to the courtroom.

Civil Action No. 91-C-1121

                          ORDER

 What follows is another chapter in the horrifying story of
Jeffrey Dahmer. The result of this chapter is that a jury trial
will be held to sort out whether, on May 27, 1991, Konerak
Sinthasomphone's right to the equal protection of the law was
violated based on race, sex, and sexual orientation by two
Milwaukee police officers and by the customs and practices of
the Milwaukee Police Department.

 The facts which gave rise to this case have previously been
recited in decisions on motions to dismiss the complaint and for
dismissal on the basis of qualified immunity. See Sinthasom-
phone v. City of Milwaukee, 785 F. Supp. 1343 (E.D. Wis. 1992);
Sinthasomphone v. City of Milwaukee, 838 F. Supp. 1320 (E.D.
Wis. 1993). What remains are claims based on a violation of
Sinthasomphone's right to the equal protection of the law.

 Motions for Summary Judgment

 Briefly, the background facts, particularly as they relate to
the equal protection claim, are that on the evening of May 27,
1991, young Sinthasomphone, a Laotian boy of 14, was seen
wandering dazed and naked on the corner of 25th and State in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Police officers, including the defendants
Joseph Gabrish and John Balcerzak, arrived on the scene. Shortly
thereafter, the now-well-known serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, a
white man, arrived and explained to the police (who were also
white) that Sinthasomphone was his friend and that he was drunk.
Despite the vigorous protestations of several African-Americans
on the scene, the officers and Dahmer led Sinthasomphone back
to Dahmer's apartment, where the body of one of Dahmer's victims
lay unnoticed in an adjoining room. Concluding that Dahmer and
Sinthasomphone were adult homosexual lovers, the officers
ultimately left Sinthasomphone with Dahmer. Thirty minutes
later, he became Dahmer's thirteenth victim.

 Both the City of Milwaukee and Officers Gabrish and Balcerzak,
have filed motions for summary judgment. Summary judgment is
appropriate only if there is "no genuine issue as to any
material fact" and if the "moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law." Rule 56, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure;
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242 (1986). In
evaluating the motions, I must "view the record and all
inferences drawn from it in the light most favorable to the
party opposing the motion." Lohorn v. Michal, 913 F.2d 327 (7th
Cir. 1990). I may not weigh the evidence. Anderson.

 In this case, many facts are not in dispute. The dispute is over
the inferences to be drawn from the facts and over what facts
are material. It is a dispute over what lens should be used to
view the facts.

 The City of Milwaukee and the officers want to view the
Milwaukee Police Department and its policymakers as they existed
in 1991 and later. The plaintiffs are willing to look at that
view, but they have a wider lens: the customs and policies of
the department as they have evolved over the years, reaching
back particularly to the reign of former Police Chief Harold
Breier.

 When the plaintiffs look back, they see a department rife with
discriminatory customs and policies. Even the City does not deny
that there were problems. The City states in its brief that:

 Chief Arreola has concluded that much needed to be done, and
much still remains to be done, to mend community relations since
the tenure of former Chief Harold Breier.

 The City contends, though, that current Chief Philip Arreola,
Mayor John Norquist, and former Fire and Police Commission
Chairman M. Nicol Padway are opposed to discrimination and have
taken steps to correct problems within the department. The City
argues that in 1991 it was clearly against police policy to
maintain discriminatory practices. The plaintiffs contend that
whatever steps have been taken have not been sufficient to
uproot deeply entrenched customs within the department, and that
in 1991 discriminatory customs were still acquiesced in by the
policymakers.

 That is an issue which can only be resolved by drawing
inferences from the facts. Evaluating motivation and intent is
not something to be done on summary judgment. Hutchinson v.
Proxmire, 443 U.S. 111 (1979). This is an issue for a jury.
Furthermore, in evaluating the evidence, the factfinder must
give close scrutiny to all circumstantial evidence. Village of
Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.';.
252 (1977).

 I will set out a sampling of facts which illustrate why a jury
must decide whether a custom or policy, acquiesced in by the
policymakers, caused the violation of Konerak Sinthasomphone's
rights. These facts will also illustrated why a wider lens than
the defendants use is the one through which this case must be
viewed.

 Harold Breier was police chief in the city of Milwaukee from
1964 until 1984. During his tenure, he was the sole policy-
maker for the department. In 1984, legislative changes were
made, and the Board of Fire and Police Commissioners became the
policy- maker for the department. See 62.50(1m), Wisconsin
Statutes. The commission can delegate authority to the police
chief; overall executive control is vested in the mayor.

 One of the defendants, Joseph Gabrish, entered the Police
Academy at the very end of Harold Breier's tenure as chief.
Officer Gabrish stated in his deposition for this case that he
held Chief Breier "in deep respect."

 Robert Ziarnik was chief of police from September 6, 1984,
through May 6, 1989. Defendant John Balcerzak entered the Police
Academy in 1985, during the tenure of Chief Ziarnik.

 During 1991, M. Nicol Padway was chairman of the Fire and
Police Commission. John Norquist was then and is now the mayor
of the city of Milwaukee. Philip Arreola was appointed chief of
police, effective November 6, 1989, and remains in that position
today. Chief Arreola was hired at least in part because he was
an advocate of and knowledgeable about "community-oriented
policing." That this was a change from the past can perhaps be
illustrated by former Chief Breier's evaluation of community
oriented policing: The police officer "doesn't have time for
that crap." This evaluation appears in a report on policy
practices in Milwaukee. The report also noted that on the
occasion of his 8Oth birthday, the former chief was quoted in
The Milwaukee Journal as saying:

 When I was chief, we were relating to the good people, and we
were relating to the other people too--we were throwing those
people in the can. . . . I always said, "The good people of
Milwaukee, they bought what the Department was selling."

 Throughout the years there have been many warnings about
problems within the Milwaukee Police Department. I will mention
a few. In Bell v. City of Milwaukee, 746 F.2d 1205 (7th Cir.
1984), the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit upheld a jury verdict finding that a 20-year conspiracy
to cover up a shooting by white Milwaukee police officers was
motivated by invidious discrimination against blacks. In 1972,
the Wisconsin Advisory Commission to the U.S. Commission on
Civil Rights found that "[t]he charge of racism among policemen
is not a new one, nor one foreign to Milwaukee."

 In 1979, the Office of Revenue Sharing conducted an
investigation of the Milwaukee Police Department and determined
that it had engaged in procedures and policies that adversely
affected employment opportunities for black police officers. See
League of Martin v. City of Milwaukee, 588 F. Supp. 1004 (E.D.
Wis. 1984). In 1981, consultants Dresner, Morris, Tortorello +
Sykes Research found a substantial degree of racial polarization
within the police department.

 Ten years later, in 1991, a Fire and Police Commission study
reported overt racism and sexism at the Policy Academy. Also in
1991, The mayor's Citizen's Commission on Police-Community
Relations reported that several residents complained of "racist
and homophobic attitudes and a general lack of respect" from
police officers. In December of that year, Detroit Police
Commissioner James Jackson and Jane White, director of the East
Lansing Training Academy, reported a "rather serious
polarization around race and gender issues."

 In 1993, reporting on its study of the Milwaukee Police
Department, the Police Foundation stated, "[T]here is
institutionalized racism and sexism that needs to be openly
discussed and dealt with." Mayor Norquist and Chairman Padway
have both stated that they agree with the statement.

 In November 1994, the Wisconsin Advisory Committee to the U.S.
Commission on Civil Rights found that the Milwaukee Police
Department has for the past two decades "manifested a police
culture unsympathetic, and even antagonistic, in its dealings
with minority communities of the City." The Committee
recommended that the chief of police and the Fire and Police
Commission make a series of joint public statement decrying
police incivility to the public, particularly the black
community. The committee noted that once a "police culture is
established, it is difficult to change." To change it, the
committee recommended a clearly stated unambiguous policy
against discriminatory practices.

 The issue in this case can be viewed as whether sufficient
efforts have been made to change allegedly prevailing
discriminatory customs of the Milwaukee Police Department or
whether the alleged discriminatory culture, policies, and
customs were allowed to exist and whether, through intention or
"deliberate indifference" [City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S.
378 (1989)], they remained in effect in May 1991, when the
officers left young Sinthasomphone in the care of Jeffrey
Dahmer.

 As the plaintiffs argue, a change in the policymaker does not
necessarily effectuate a change in deeply entrenched de facto
policies. These are issues which a jury will have to resolve by
looking at the past as well as at the time of this incident to
see what the policies were in 1991.

 As to the individual officers, the issue is whether they acted
in a discriminatory fashion. They say in their affidavits that
they did not. However, because motive and intent are subject to
proof only circumstantially, summary judgment is not often a
useful tool to resolve these issues. See Hutchinson v. Proxmire,
443 U.S. 111 (1979). There is in this record, evidence from
which a jury may be allowed to draw inferences to support the
plaintiffs' case. The plaintiffs have a right to present their
claims to a jury. I cannot, as a matter of law, deprive them of
that right.

 Motions in Limine

 Defendants Gabrish and Balcerzak have filed a motion to exclude
the testimony of one of plaintiffs' designated expert witnesses,
Stanley Smith. Mr. Smith should be called to provide expert
testimony regarding the value of Konerak Sinthasomphone's loss
of the enjoyment of life, or hedonic damages. There are several
objections to the testimony: that Mr. Smith's theory and
methodology cannot be tested or substantiated, have not received
favorable peer review, have an unknown rate of error, and are
not generally accepted by other economists. Furthermore,
defendants argue, Mr. Smith's testimony will not assist the
jury.

 According to the plaintiffs, Mr. Smith has analyzed over 67
studies from which he concludes that economists seeking to place
a monetary value on human life have arrived at valuations
between $1.5 million and $3 million, when their figures are
converted to the value of the 1988 dollar. Mr. Smith himself
places the value of life at $2.3 million as measured in 1988
dollars.

 He then makes appropriate adjustments to (1) convert 1988 U.S.
dollars to their present value, and (2) adjust the life
expectancy of Konerak Sinthasomphone (59.1 years) as opposed to
the 45-year average inherent in an economic model. He further
finds nothing in the background or condition of this 14-year-old
to require a downward adjustment.

 His conclusion is that the value of the life of Konerak
Sinthasomphone in current United States dollars is in the
approximate amount of $3.4 million.

 The testimony of Mr. Smith has specifically been the subject of
two reported cases in the court of appeals for this circuit.
Sherrod v. Berry is a case which was ultimately considered en
banc by the court. In the district court the plaintiffs
prevailed. The district judge had admitted the testimony of Mr.
Smith [629 F. Supp. 159 (N.D. Ill, 1985)]. At first the court of
appeals affirmed the judgment [827 F.2d 195 (7th Cir. 1987)].
The court was entirely uncritical of the admission of Mr.
Smith's testimony; in fact, stated that the testimony was
"invaluable" to the jury.

 That decision was vacated [835 F.2d 1222 (7th Cir. 1988)] and
the en banc decision followed [856 F.2d 802 (7th Cir. 1988)]. In
the latter, the judgment of the district court was reversed.
There was no discussion, however, of the testimony of Mr. Smith,
and the court, in fact, stated that the district court should
consider matter not discussed in the en banc opinion "in light
of this court's prior discussion of those matters . . . ." At
870, n.5.

 Then in a later case, Mercado v. Ahmed, 974 F.2d 863 (7th Cir.
1992), the court upheld the decision of the district judge to
exclude the testimony of Mr. Smith. The court stated that it was
merely deciding that exclusion of the testimony was not an abuse
of discretion. However, it is fair to say that this time, when
the court looked at the issue of Mr. Smith's testimony, it was
highly critical: "A witness who knows no more than the average
person is not an expert." At 870. It damned with faint praise:

 All this is not to imply that we can state conclusively that
Smith's approach is devoid of any merit.

 At 871.

 Of course, both approaches the Seventh Circuit has taken
regarding the testimony must be reevaluated in light of Daubert
v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc., 113 S. Ct. 2787 (1993). The
Supreme Court has expressed its faith in the ability of district
judges to separate the wheat from the chaff, guided by the
question "whether the expert is proposing to testify to (1)
scientific knowledge that (2) will assist the trier of fact to
understand or determine a fact in issue." At 2796.

 The problem with Mr. Smith's testimony is that he is attempting
to quantify something which cannot truly be determined: what is
the value of a human life? He rests his determination on a
number of studies which are in themselves grounded in the
science of economics--which, in the first place, is not quite
like physics. Does this mean that his testimony will not assist
the jury or will mislead them?

 I am not, at this point, convinced of that. His testimony may
conceivably be useful for the jury to have some starting point
in their attempt to place a value on life. On the other hand,
his testimony may be the kind of "junk" that should not be heard
in a court of law. At trial, after a short offer of proof as to
the nature of the testimony, I will make a final decision on
whether this evidence can be presented. The plaintiffs may not
make any reference to it in opening statement.

 Defendants Gabrish and Balcerzak have also filed a motion to
preclude expert testimony that they intentionally discriminated
against Sinthasomphone. The motion will also be denied at this
time. It involves issues which can only be considered once I
hear the questions which the experts are asked.

 IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the defense motions for summary
judgment are DENIED.

 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the motions to exclude testimony are
DENIED at this time. They may be renewed at the trial.

 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the attached pretrial order be
complied with and a report filed by March 15, 1995. The trial
will start, as scheduled, at 10 a.m. on March 21, 1995.

 Dated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this 2nd day of March, 1995.

 BY THE COURT:

III. RELIEF SOUGHT

21. Petitioners seek an Order from the Court authorizing the
disinterment of the alleged remains of John Wilkes Booth from
Green Mount Cemetery, Baltimore, Maryland, for scientific
examination.

22. Petitioners contend that they possess the legal, and
incontestable right, as a matter of consanguinity and public
interest to be granted said relief.

IV. LEGAL STANDING

23. Petitioner Virginia Eleanor Humbrecht Kline, her children
and grandchildren and Petitioner Lois White Rathbun, her
daughter, Louise H. Edmiston, her children and grandchildren,
and Marie H. Worster (hereinafter collectively referred to as
"Booth Relatives") are descendants and legal heirs of John
Wilkes Booth, and possess all lawful rights entitled thereto.

24. The Booth Relatives are the legal heirs referred to in the
Certificate of Ownership (See Exhibit XVIII) executed in 1869 by
Mary Ann Holmes Booth, the mother of John Wilkes Booth, for the
Booth family plot located within the confines of The Green
Mount Cemetery, and, therefore, maintain all legal control over
the plot and remains interred therein.

25. The original Certificate of Ownership to the Booth family
burial plot is in the possession of Mrs. Marie H. Worster, Both
Mrs. Worster and Mrs. Louise Edmiston, who are the sole
remaining siblings of Petitioner Virginia Eleanor Humbrecht
Kline, have submitted letters to the undersigned counsel
granting their permission for the exhumation and examination
of the remains. Permission has also been granted by the family
of Mrs. Edmiston which includes three daughters, one
granddaughter and four grandsons.

26. Twenty-two legal heirs of John Wilkes Booth, therefore, have
granted permission for the exhumation and examination. These
heirs likely constitute the closest living decedents of John
Wilkes Booth, and are of a sufficient number to permit
authorization of the disinterment.

27. A petition was submitted by Petitioners Orlowek and
Chitty on March 8, 1994 for consideration by the State's Attorney
for Baltimore City, Mr. Stuart O. Simms, Esquire, for a waiver
of any criminal penalties under MD. ANN. CODE art. 27, 265
(1992) that may arise from the exhumation of a body. Messrs.
Orlowek and Chitty possess standing as a matter of public
interest, and on the authority of the Booth Relatives who have
granted their permission for the exhumation. Upon information
and belief, the State's Attorney for Baltimore City has no
opposition to the requested relief sought. An Order by this
Court eliminates the necessity to obtain permission from the
State's Attorney. 76 Op.Atty.Gen 27 (1991).

V. PRELIMINARY STEPS TAKEN TO OBTAIN AUTHORIZATION TO EXHUME THE
REMAINS

28. All possible steps have been taken to avoid litigation in
this matter.

29. The Green Mount Cemetery has been approached several times
by Petitioners Orlowek and Chitty, and their counsel, over the
last two years in order to obtain permission to exhume the
remains.

30. On March 8. 1994, Petitioners Orlowek and Chitty submitted
a petition to the State's Attorney for Baltimore City seeking
waiver of any criminal penalties under MD. ANN. CODE art. 27,
265 (1992). A meeting occurred on May 11, 1994, between
Petitioners' counsel, Mark S. Zaid, Mr. Timothy Doory, the Chief
of the Violent Crimes Unit of the State's Attorney's Office, and
Mr. William C. Trimble, the President of Green Mount Cemetery,
to discuss Petitioners' application. Had the Cemetery agreed to
the request of the Petitioners, the State's Attorney was to grant
authorization for the exhumation.

31. At the May 11, 1994 meeting, the Booth Relatives, through
counsel, informed the Cemetery of their legal right to the Booth
family plot, and requested permission to exhume the remains.

32. Rather than grant permission for the exhumation, Green
Mount Cemetery informed Petitioners' counsel of their desire to
have this Court rule on the Petition herein. The Cemetery
asserts it requires a Court Order to adequately protect its
interests.

33. The Petitioners have informed Green Mount Cemetery of their
willingness to place legal notices, in a manner or method
satisfactory to the Court, in order to attempt to notify
additional Booth family members of the relief sought by this
Petition. However, neither the Petitioners, Green Mount Cemetery
or the State's Attorney is under any duty to notify, or obtain
the consent of, additional descendants of the family. Walser v.
Resthaven et al., 93 Md.App. 371 (1993). Nevertheless, as a
showing of good faith, the Petitioners would be willing to place
such notices if requested by the Court.

34. The Petitioners have also agreed to hold Green Mount
Cemetery harmless with respect to any claims or damages arising
from any actions surrounding the exhumation and transport of
the remains. All permits required by law will be obtained by the
Petitioners in cooperation with the Cemetery and relevant
authorities.

VI. LEGAL ANALYSIS

35. By all accounts, this is a unique Petition. Historically,
exhumations are seldom contested alleviating the need for any
court intervention. The issue was one of first impression in
Maryland until 1939 when the Court of Appeals issued its ruling
in Radomer Russ-Pol Unterstitzung Verein v. Posner, 176 Md. 332,
(1939). The Court noted that "it is a matter of common knowledge
that the number of cases cited is infinitesimal as compared
with the number of disinterments which never find their way into
the courthouse." Id. at 334.

36. The Court of Special Appeals in Maryland recently opined
that "respectful disinterments have been looked upon as private
concerns of the deceased's family and the cemetery, if they all
agree ... [and] if there is any disagreement among the family
or the cemetery as to any contemplated ... disinterment, relief
can be afforded in certain circumstances, in either equity or
law, depending upon the nature of the controversy." Walser v.
Resthaven, 93 Md. App. 371, 381- 3g2 (1993).

37. In the rare instances where an exhumation does become one of
dispute, it is likely to involve close relatives of the
deceased. A typical situation would involve a dispute between
the deceased's widow and the deceased's parents or siblings over
interring the body in a location other than where the remains
were first buried. See Dougherty v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit and
Trust Company, 282 Md. 617 (1978).

38. Notwithstanding the factual distinctions between the
typical exhumation in dispute and the request herein (which at
the time of the filing of this application is not being disputed
by any known party with a legal interest), case law
nevertheless provides sufficient guidance and supports a
determination in the Petitioners' favor.

39. In arriving at a determination to authorize disinterment
of a body for a postmortem examination or reinterment
elsewhere, controlling consideration is to given by the courts
to several factors: "(1) the interest of the public; (2) wishes
of the decedent; (3) rights and feelings of those entitled to be
heard by reason of relationship; (4) the rights and principles
of religious bodies or other organizations which granted the
right to inter the body in the first place of burial, and (5)
the question of whether or not consent was given to the burial
in the first place of interment by the one claiming the right of
removal." Theodore v. Theodore, 57 N.M. 434, 259 P.2d 795
(1959).

40. The State of Maryland has recognized these factors as
significant considerations and more recently suggested "the
following factors to be controlling in order of importance: (I)
the wishes of the deceased, (2) the wishes of the widow/widower
and next of kin ... and (3) the regulations of the cemetery."
Dougherty v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit and Trust Company, 282
Md. 617, 620 (1978). See also Radomer Russ-Pol Unterstitzung
Verein v. Posner, 176 Md. 332 (1939).

41. In consideration of these factors; first, regardless of the
identity of the person interred in Green Mount Cemetery, there
are no known expressed wishes of the decedent regarding the
place of his interment.

42. Second, it is likely the closest known living relatives of
John Wilkes Booth have been located and have executed written
permission to allow the exhumation and examination of the
remains. Furthermore, it is the Petitioners' contention that a
sufficient number of relatives of John Wilkes Booth have
granted their permission to justify court authorization of the
exhumation.

43. Third, Green Mount Cemetery, by way of its President,
William C. Trimble, Jr., has informed Petitioners' counsel that
should the exhumation be ordered by the Court, the Cemetery will
abide by such an order.

44. Fourth, the interests of the public are paramount in this
instance. The question of whether Booth survived thirty-eight
years past the assassination of President Lincoln, contrary to
the official historical record of the United States, can not be
taken lightly, nor ignored, considering the long-standing public
interest that has continued for over one hundred years.

45. Hundreds of newspaper articles, magazines and books
published from 1865 to 1994 have explored the theory that Booth
may have escaped capture. The seriousness and intense public
interest still surrounding this controversy is demonstrated by
the prominent individuals and institutions in support of the
exhumation. (See Exhibits XX-XVII).

46. In fact, this issue still receives widespread media
attention today as demonstrated by the publication of a lengthy
feature article by The Philadelphia Inquirer Magazine on October
23, 1994, the day prior to the filing of this Petition. (See
Exhibit XIX).

47. Fifth, the exhumation and examination of the remains buried
in the Booth family plot as John Wilkes Booth is the only means
by which several families will be able to determine their true
and proper lineage. Of course, as stories have circulated
throughout the decades of Booth's escape so, too, has it been
alleged that children were sired by the assassin and that their
descendants continue to live today. These include, for example,
Mrs. Elizabeth R. Booth and her daughters, Lisa and Lori. Their
family history, as it has been handed down in story and in
writing, supports the conclusions asserted by the Petitioners.

48. Furthermore, the Robey family of Maryland clearly has a
vested interest in the exhumation so as to verify whether or not
their ancestor was actually the person killed by federal troops
rather than John Wilkes Booth. There are many other families
that maintain similar interests. Indeed, as recently as the
1980s, a stage actor was billing himself as the great-great
-great- grandson of John Wilkes Booth; having descended from the
family of Izola Forrester, who purported in her 1937 book This
One Mad Act to be the granddaughter of Booth. Hanchett,
William, The Lincoln Murder Conspiracies 242 (1983).

49. Finally, historic exhumations have, in the last decade,
received considerable support. This is primarily due to the
advancement of science and technology and, in particular, the
existence of DNA testing. Where serious historical questions
persist regarding the identity or circumstances surrounding the
death of historical figures, the courts or the governing
authoritative powers have permitted an exhumation to occur.

50. In recent years highly publicized exhumations have been
authorized on such individuals as Lee Harvey Oswald (question of
identity), the accused assassin of President John F. Kennedy,
see Eddowes v. Curry, 599 S.W.2d 367 (1980); Eddowes v. Oswald,
621 S.W.2d 843 (1981); President Zachary Taylor (circumstances
of death); Dr. Carl Weiss (circumstances of death), the alleged
assassin of Senator Huey Long; the parents of Lizzie Borden
(circumstances of death); and, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid (question of identity).

51. The exhumation of Lee Harvey Oswald is perhaps most
pertinent to the instant matter. Author Michael Eddowes, a
British citizen of no relation to Oswald, sought to have Oswald
exhumed and examined based on his theory that the man killed
by Jack Ruby was not Oswald but, instead, a Soviet agent who had
taken his place. The strength of his evidence lay in height
discrepancies and the failure of the original autopsy reports to
include the existence of certain known scars. Eddowes was
eventually successful and the body was exhumed in 1981. Upon
examination the body was identified as that of Lee Harvey
Oswald and a very controversial theory was finally put to rest
forever.

52. The evidence presented that led to the aforementioned
historical exhumations falls far short of the physical and
documentary evidence proffered herein to support the exhumation
of the alleged remains of John Wilkes Booth.

VII. HISTORlCAL BACKGROUND

53. On the night of April 14, 1865 the sixteenth President of
the United States of America, Abraham Lincoln, was fatally shot
while attending a performance at Ford's Theater in Washington,
D.C. By the time President Lincoln died the following morning,
his assassin had already been identified. John Wilkes Booth,
twenty-six years of age and a celebrated and well- known actor,
became the subject of the largest manhunt in American history
at the time.

54. On April 26, 1865, the 16th New York Cavalry cornered
Booth at Richard Garrett's farm in Bowling Green, Virginia.
Trapped within the Garretts' barn, Booth refused to surrender
to the detachment of armed federal troops that surrounded him.
Forced out by fire, Booth was struck down by a single shot to
the neck. Within a matter of hours, the assassin was dead.

55. After being brought back to Washington, D.C. the body was
buried under the floor of the Old Penitentiary at the Washington
Arsenal (where the trial and hanging of the conspirators would
later take place) until 1867, when it was exhumed and then
stored in the Arsenal Warehouse. On February 15, 1869, due to
rampant rumors concerning the possibility of Booth having
escaped, President Johnson ordered the body turned over to the
Booth family and it was shortly thereafter interred in
Baltimore's Green Mount Cemetery where it has remained ever
since.

56. It is there that the official historical record of Booth's
last days ends and the dispute at hand begins.

57. Many stories concerning the fate of John Wilkes Booth have
been reported throughout the years since the events described
above. At times Booth was reported to have been living in
Ceylon, India, Mexico and locations across the American
Southwest. But only one story, supported by both physical and
eyewitness evidence, has survived through the years with its
credibility and persuasiveness still intact.

58. It was in 1872 when a young lawyer practicing in Granbury,
Texas named Finis L. Bates first met John St. Helen. Bates
described him as having "splendid Grecian features, sparkling,
deep-set black eyes, wavy, inky black hair and a fine
complexion....His voice was soft and pleasant in conversation
and in his recitations of passages from Shakespeare's plays,
especially Richard III, with which he often entertained small
groups in private." Finis Bates, The Escape and Suicide of John
Wilkes Booth (1907)(hereinafter "Bates, Escape).

59. Shortly after it was ascertained that legal troubles faced
by one of Bates' clients were actually the responsibility of St.
Helen, an agreement was arranged between the gentlemen to
resolve the problem. But in doing so, St. Helen made one demand:
he could not make a public appearance in court or before the
district attorney for fear of being recognized. The nature of
this fear went unexplained but the matter was resolved
nonetheless.

60. Then, in early 1877, St. Helen thought himself near death.
Requesting the presence of Bates at his side, St. Helen informed
him: "I am dying. My name is John Wilkes Booth, and I am the
assassin of President Lincoln. Get the picture of myself from
under this pillow. I leave it with you for my further
identification. Notify my brother Edwin Booth, of New York
City." St. Helen recovered from his illness, and several weeks
later reconfirmed the veracity of his previous remarks. Bates,
Escape at 30.

61. "I have told you that my name is not St. Helen", he said to
Bates, "and, in fact, my name is John Wilkes Booth, a son of the
late Junius Brutus Booth, Sr., the actor, and a brother of
Junius Brutus Booth the second and Edwin Booth the actor." It
was then, to a disbelieving Bates, that St. Helen recounted his
story of escaping the federal troops at Garrett's farm and how,
instead of he, it was, in actuality, a young man named Ruddy or
Robey who had been killed and identified as Booth due to the
fact he was in possession of some of Booth's intimate
belongings, including a diary. Id. at 33.

62. By 1878, the two men had gone their separate ways. But as
the years passed Bates continued to investigate the incredible
story he had been told, including corresponding with high
officials in the War Department during the 1890s.

63. Finally, in 1903, without warning, Bates received word that
a man named David E. George had apparently committed suicide
in Enid, Oklahoma. Personal papers of the man bore Bates' name
and the word was spreading that the deceased had admitted to
being John Wilkes Booth. (See Exhibit XX). After viewing the
body Bates declared it to be his old friend St. Helen and
instructed the mortician to mummify the remains.

64. This mummy uas later exhibited throughout the United
States during the early decades of the twentieth century bearing
the monocle of John Wilkes Booth, assassin of a President.
Bates, by now a prominent attorney in Tennessee, published his
account of the story in his 1907 book The Escape and Suicide of
John Wilkes Booth. Bates' allegations have been subsequently
chronicled over the years in such publications, for example, as
Startling Detective Adventures, a popular magazine of the early
1930s. (See Exhibit XXI).

VIII. EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS' CONTENTION

65. It is the contention of the Petitioners that the historical
record presents conflicting evidence as to the identity of the
body presently interred in the Booth family plot in Green Mount
Cemetery as John Wilkes Booth.

A. Hair Color Discrepancy

66. A glaring inconsistency exists regarding the hair color of
the person killed at Garrett's farm and that of John Wilkes
Booth. At least three witnesses have indicated that the person
identified as Booth had, in fact, red or reddish-brown hair
while Booth himself had very dark, black hair.

67. Sgt. Wilson D. Kenzie, who asserted he was present at the
shooting on Garrett's farm, stated in a sworn affidavit that the
individual killed had sandy hair. "I seized him up as being an
ordinary Virginia farmer. What I do know and positively state
is that it was not the body of John Wilkes Booth. By that time
the officers came up and ordered me ... to keep still and not
say that it wasn't Booth saying the least you say about it, you
are better off." (See Exhibit XXII).

68. Basil Moxley, who asserted he was one of the pallbearers at
the Green Mount Cemetery interment, told the Baltimore News
American, in an article that appeared on June 3, 1903, that the
1869 burial was a "mock funeral". He further stated that he had
"known Booth all of my life and was very close to the family",
that "there were never any two things in the world which
resembled each other less than that body did John Wilkes Booth",
and that specifically he had seen "the body several times and
examined it and I don't hesitate to say that the hair on the
dead body was of a reddish brown color, while Booth's was as
black as a raven's wing." (See Exhibit XXIII).

69. Another witness was Lt. William C. Allen of the United
States Secret Service. His widow reportedly informed a
journalist that the Booth corpse Allen saw had auburn or
chestnut colored hair. (See Exhibit XXIII).

70. Descendants of the Robey family (the name St. Helen used
to identify the individual who might have been killed at
Garrett's farm) have been traced and interviewed by Petitioner
Nathaniel Orlowek. They have indicated that according to their
family history one of their ancestors disappeared and was never
seen again following April 26, 1865. The Robey family has a
history of reddish-brown hair.

B. Statements Concerning Booth's Escape

71. Other witnesses, including relatives of Booth, have stated
they encountered him long after he was thought to have been
killed or that they were aware that he had escaped.

72. Blanche Booth, a niece of John Wilkes Booth, swore out an
affidavit that her uncle attempted to visit her during a
performance in Enid, Oklahoma in December,1902. Ms. Booth also
identified the photograph and mummy, both of which are
described in further detail herein, as that of John Wilkes
Booth. (See Exhibit XXIV).

73. Fannie Bell, who identified herself as a first cousin of
John Wilkes Booth, was told by family members that he had
escaped. Ms. Bell believed that John St. Helen was her cousin,
John Wilkes Booth. (See Exhibit XXV).

74. Nathaniel Charles Newman, who also identified himself as a
first cousin of John Wilkes Booth, executed a sworn affidavit
that Booth visited his home several times after April, 1865.
Newman also identified the mummy of David E. George as John
Wilkes Booth. (See Exhibit XXVI).

75. John P. Simonton, Esq., a former custodian of the War
Department's files on John Wilkes from 1877-1920, executed an
affidavit stating that no definitive proof existed that Booth
was ever captured. (See Exhibit XXVII).

C. Identification of St. Helen's Photograph as Booth

76. Bates maintained possession of the tintype photograph that
St. Helen had given to him in 1877 and went to great lengths to
show it to friends, colleagues and relatives of Booth, St. Helen
and George.

77. The publishers and editors of both the El Rerlo Republican
and El Reno Daily Democrat, both of whom knew George, identified
the photograph as being that of David E. George. An officer of
the El Reno State Bank also stated that the St. Helen photograph
was of George in his younger years. Bates, Escape at 284-86.

78. The City Editor of the Daily Democrat did not know George
but, upon being shown the photograph, indicated he felt the
picture was of John Wilkes Booth. When asked as to why he
thought this to be so, he indicated that he knew Booth well
"personally and on the stage. I regarded him as the greatest
actor of his day on the American stage, and never missed an
opportunity to see him. I saw him and heard him in Baltimore
and New York often, and in Washington also, where I was
connected with the Federal Army, and saw him as a personal
acquaintance. I remember that I saw him for the last time only
a short time before the assassination. I also know other members
of the Booth family and could not be mistaken about this
picture." L. at 286-87.

79. Bates showed the photograph to an old friend of Booth who
also stated that the picture was of Booth although at an age
older than when he last saw him shortly before the
assassination. L. at 299-303.

80. In a sworn statement, Junius Brutus Booth, III, a nephew of
John Wilkes Booth, stated: "I, Junius Brutus Booth, of the city
of Boston, Massachusetts, recognize the likeness of John Wilkes
Booth [in the St. Helen tintype] not only in comparison with
other photographs and pictures of said John Wilkes Booth, but I
can also trace a strong family resemblance and a likeness to
different members of my family in the said tintype." Id. at 304
-09.

81. The tintype photograph and the original affidavits quoted
herein are in the possession of Georgetown University Library's
Special Collections Division where they are part of the E.H.
Swaim Collection. Swaim, an attorney, Lincoln historian and
supporter of the Booth escape theory, purchased Bates' papers in
furtherance of his own research.

D. Statements of David E. George

82. Mrs. E.C. Harper was an acquaintance of David E. George
while he lived in Oklahoma. In a statement given after George's
death, Mrs. Harper wrote:

"Mr. George ... had always been well supplied with money, the
origin or source of which no one knew, for from some mysterious
source he received a regular remittance ... though he claimed to
be a painter of houses, yet he did not work ... Generally he was
gloomy, though at times he would brighten up, sing snatches of
stage songs and repeat Shakespeare's plays in an admirable
manner. He was so well versed in these plays and other writings
that he would often answer questions with a quotation. At one
time the young people of El Reno [Oklahoma] had a play of some
kind. One of the actors became ill and Mr. George filled the
place to the great admiration and entertainment of those who saw
him. When surprise was expressed at his ability as an actor he
replied that he had acted some when he was a young man. Never do
I remember his mentioning the history of his past life or that
he was other than David E. George until he thought he was going
to die -- that was about the middle of April, 1902.

[He said] I feel as if I am going to be sick.' He was Iying on
his bed and he asked me to get him a mirror. [He said] This
messenger of death is my quest, and I desire to see the curtain
of death fall upon the last tragic act of mine. I have something
to tell you. I am going to die in a few minutes, and I don't
believe you would do anything to injure me. Did it ever occur to
you that I am anything but an ordinary painter? I killed the
best man that ever lived.' I asked him who it was and he
answered: Abraham Lincoln.' [H]e seemed to be perfectly rational
while talking to me. He knew me and knew where he was, and I
believe he really thought in fact that he was dying, and asked
me to keep his secret until he was dead, adding that if anyone
should find out that he was J. Wilkes Booth they would take him
out and hang him, and the people who loved him so well now would
despise him. He told me that people high in official life hated
Lincoln and were implicated in his assassination. He said that
the suspense of possibly being detected preyed on his mind all
the time and was something awful, and that his life was
miserable ... He said that he was devoted to acting, but had to
give it up because of his crime, and the fact that he must remain
away from the stage, when he loved the life and profession of
acting so well, made him restless and ill tempered." Bates,
Escape, at 231-37.

83. George died a few months later, apparently by his own
hand, on January 13, 1903. The proprietor and a clerk of the
hotel where George died both signed sworn statements that upon
hearing George's cries and rushing to his aid, he gasped, "I am
-- am John Wilkes Booth. I killed -- killed -- Abraham Lincoln
Bernice Babcock, Booth and the Spirit of Lincoln 306-09 (1924).
Among George's effects was a letter addressed to F. L. Bates.

E. The Mummy

84. The body of "David E. George" was mummified at the request
of Finis L. Bates, who had been called upon to examine the body
after his name had been found on George's correspondence.
Following Bates' death in 1923, the mummy was sold to a
sideshow carnival where it proceeded to tour the country.

85. In December, 1931 the mummy was examined by six Chicago
physicians. It was measured, weighed, photographed, x-rayed and
even opened. As reported in the April 1932 issue of Startling
Detective Adventures, these physicians "had accepted the
invitation to make this final examination in the belief that
they could prove the falsity of the claims made for the corpse.
Definite physical malformations known to have existed in the
body of John Wilkes Booth could be easily recognized . .. if
this were Booth's body. " Id. at 41.

86. The results, as stated in the final report of the
physicians. was that unless the mummy is the body of Booth, "we
have run into a most amazing and unbelievable set of
coincidences". Id. at 56. (See Exhibit XXVIII).

87. Among the findings from the examination of the mummy was:

1) An injury over the right eye socket;

2) Injury to the right thumb;

3) Injury to the left fibula.

88. Booth was known to have suffered the following injuries:

1) An injury over the right eye incurred during sword-play;

2) A malformed thumb said to have been caused when Booth caught
his hand in a curtain windlass;

3) An injury to his left leg caused by his leap from the
presidential box to the stage in Ford's theater.

89. If the mummy had been missing any one of these injuries, it
could have been conclusively disproved to be that of John Wilkes
Booth. As it now stands, the physical evidence continues to lend
credence to the theory that Booth survived thirty-eight years
after the assassination.

90. The mummy was allegedly last seen in the Philadelphia area
in the 1970s. Efforts to locate it have been unsuccessful.

F. The Autopsy of "John Wilkes Booth"

91. The autopsy performed on the suspected assassin several
hours after his death is partly responsible for many of the
reasons why suspicions still exist concerning the identity of
the body. For the same reasons the assassination and autopsy of
President John F. Kennedy would lead to allegations of cover-up
nearly one hundred years later, the autopsy of Lincoln's alleged
assassin was considered to be incomplete, fraught with errors
and far too secretive.

92. For example, Dr. John Frederick May, a local Washington
practitioner, was summoned by the government to the Washington
Navy Yard where the monitor Montauk was docked with the remains
of the alleged assassin onboard. Although May eventually reached
the conclusion that the body was that of John Wilkes Booth his
comments and reports have contributed to the history of
confusion surrounding the body's identification.

93. Writing in a detailed 1887 account, Dr. May described the
moment in which he was shown the body. "By his [Surgeon General
J.K. Barnes] order the cover was removed, and to my great
astonishment revealed a body in whose lineaments there was to
me no resemblance to the man I had known in life! My surprise
was so great that I at once said to General Barnes, There is no
resemblance in that corpse to Booth, nor can I believe it to be
that of him."' May, J.F., Mark of the Scalpel, Manuscript
Division, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.

94. Not only did Dr. May describe the body during his April
27, 1865 testimony before Brigadier-General Joseph Holt, the
Judge Advocate General of the United States Army, as being
freckled -- although Booth was not -- but he also later
identified the corpse as having a broken right leg although it
was the left leg that Booth supposedly broke upon his leap to
the stage. Although this was attributed to a simple error of
description, soon after the 1869 burial of the body in Green
Mount Cemetery, the Baltimore Gazette reported that one of its
reporters had been present at the exhumation and had noted that
the body did, in fact, have a broken right leg. Lloyd Lewis,
Myths After Lincoln 239 (1940).

95. Despite the fact that onboard the Montauk were some of
Booth's co-conspirators in the plot and that close friends and
relatives were nearby in Washington, none of them were called
upon to identify the body. Instead, approximately ten
individuals who were only casually acquainted with Booth were
brought onboard to view the body. Government testimony elicited
comments of the nature that the body was identified as Booth
only by its "general appearance", far less a standard of
identification that would have been accepted by a court of law
even in that day.

96. Perhaps the one piece of evidence that would lead to
clarification of the identity of the body examined onboard the
Montauk is a photograph taken by Alexander Gardner, a colleague
of famed Civil War photographer Matthew Brady. Unfortunately,
both the photographic plate and the single photograph printed
were immediately confiscated by an official of the United
States government and have never surfaced since.

97. A complete, non-secretive autopsy and the subsequent written
report should have been able to withstand and dispel any rumors
whatsoever of Booth's survival that could be raised. Instead,
the accounts and reports have only led to more questions.

98. The failure of the autopsy to produce satisfactory answers
became quite evident not long after the event. A debate on the
matter was held before the United States Senate in July of 1866.

SENATOR GARRET DAVIS (KY): I have never seen myself any
satisfactory evidence that Booth was killed.

SENATOR REVERDY JOHNSON (MD): I submit to my friend from
Kentucky that there are some things that we must take judicial
notice of, just as well as that Julius Caesar is dead.

SENATOR DAVIS: I would rather have better testimony of the fact.
I want it proved that Booth was in that barn....I have never
seen anybody, or the evidence of anybody, that identified Booth
after he is said to have been killed.

Why so much secrecy about it?...There is a mystery and a most
inexplicable mystery to my mind about the whole
affair....[Booth] could have been captured just as well alive as
dead. It would have been much more satisfactory to have brought
him up here alive and to have inquired of him to reveal the
whole transaction...[or bring his body up here...let all who had
seen him playing, all who associated with him on the stage or
in the green room or at the taverns and other public places,
have had access to his body to have identified it. Congressional
Globe, 28 July 1866, p. 4292.

99. The January-February 1993 issue of Navy Medicine, the
official publication of the Navy Medical Department, published
an article entitled "Identification and Autopsy of John Wilkes
Booth: Reexamining the Evidence". (See Exhibit XXIX). In
preparation for the article a team of forensic pathologists and
anthropologists from the National Museum of Health and Medicine
examined the cervical vertebrae that was removed from the body
at the time of autopsy and which is now on display in the
Museum. As a result, the magazine's editor commented that "[a]
forensic study of the long bones and skull augmented by the use
of video superimposition could establish once and for all
whether the body of John Wilkes Booth reposes in Baltimore's
Green Mount Cemetery." L. at 26.

IX. PLANNED EXAMINATION OF THE REMAINS OF "JOHN WILKES BOOTH"

100. Upon obtaining permission to proceed with the exhumation,
scientific teams from the Smithsonian Institution's National
Museum of Natural History and the Armed Forces Institute of
Pathology's National Museum of Health & Medicine, and other
qualified persons as may be deemed necessary, will undertake
preliminary testing of the burial site. The purpose of such
testing will be to ascertain the condition of the remains within
the burial vault.

101. Unfortunately, there exists no telltale criteria that can
be applied that will lead us to a determination with any degree
of certainty, short of exhumation, of the condition of the
remains after 129 years.

102. Factors of significance include, but are not limited to,
the type of coffin that was used, the acidity of the soil and the
manner in which the body was handled during 1865-1869, when it
was in the custody of the government.

103. The taking of soil core samples to determine the acidity of
the surrounding area and the application of ground-penetrating
radar to ascertain the type of coffin and to verify, after
consulting the records of Green Mount Cemetery, the specific
location of the unmarked grave are two tests that may be applied
prior to the actual exhumation.

104. After the exhumation the remains will be transferred to the
Smithsonian Institution's Museum of Natural History. There, an
examination will be conducted to determine age, sex, race,
stature, body build and the presence of any skeletal injuries
(e.g., fractured leg bone sustained during assassination and
verification of the missing three cervical vertebrae that are
labeled as being taken from John Wilkes Booth and presently on
display in the National Museum of Health & Medicine/AFIP in
Washington).

105. Depending upon the condition of the remains other
procedures will also be performed, including video and
photographic superimposition, such as was used to identify the
remains of Nazi Doctor Josef Mengele, radiography, toxicological
studies, hair analysis, a forensic odontology examination,
clothing inspection and DNA testing and comparison.

106. Following the examination of the remains, if the question
of the identity remains inconclusive or it is determined to be
John Wilkes Booth, the body will be reinterred in Green Mount
Cemetery. Should a finding be reached that the remains are not
those of John Wilkes Booth, the body will, of course, need to be
reinterred in an appropriate location. This location be
determined by a consensus of the interested parties.

X. CONCLUSION

107. Nearly 130 years after the assassination what does it
matter? The response of one historian nearly 30 years ago
remains just as valid an answer as it would today. "Aside from
normal curiosity about any murder mystery and particularly about
one involving a man of Lincoln's stature, it matters deeply
because the assassination undoubtedly changed the course of
American history." Robert Fowler, The Assassination of Abraham
Lincoln 48 (1965).

108. Whether Booth survived past 1865 remains a hotly contested
topic that appears to have no resolution in sight, except by
granting the relief requested herein by the Petitioners. The
issue presented here is not whether the theory that Booth
escaped capture has been proven by the contents of this Petition
nor even if it should be believed. The legal issue is the
standing of the Petitioners. This has been amply demonstrated
herein. The historical issue is whether this matter has risen to
a level of significance so as to merit the granting of the
relief requested. The answer to this question is more than
evident.

109. On these issues there can be no disagreement. For over one
hundred years this subject has been debated by historians,
politicians, authors and the general public at large. It has
been the center of attention of congressional debate, books,
newspaper articles, magazines and television programs and will
likely continue to be for decades to come. 110. Indeed, one
author wrote over 50 years ago that "[t]he question of whether
or not the man who died at Garrett's farm was John Wilkes Booth
is one that doubtless will never be settled." Stem, Philip Van
Doren, The Man Who Killed Lincoln 402 (1939).

111. The evidence of Booth's escape now only exists in
documentary form. We cannot ascertain the credibility of the
people who provided the testimony or affidavits that originally
spurred this debate. The technology now exists to close the
books on this controversy forever, and ensure that history has
been taught correctly or is corrected. There remains, therefore,
but just one proper remedy available to resolve this historical
debate.

WHEREFORE, Petitioners respectfully request:

(I) That this Court issue an Order authorizing the disinterment
and examination of the alleged remains of John Wilkes Booth from
The Green Mount Cemetery;

(2) Any further and additional relief which the Court deems just
and proper.

Case No. BC115656

MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER
RESPONSES TO NOTICE OF
PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
AT DEPOSITION; DECLARATION OF
CARY W. GOLDSTEIN; REQUEST FOR
SANCTIONS; POINTS AND AUTHOR-
ITIES IN SUPPORT THEREOF.

HON. EDWARD ROSS

Date : May 24th, 1995
Time : 9:00 A.M.
Place: Department 39

 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE THAT: Ruth Tyrangiel, through her attorney of
record herein, will on May 24th, 1995, at 9:00 A.M., before this
Court in Department 39, located at 111 No. Hill St., Los
Angeles, California, move the Court for an Order compelling
Defendant Bob Dylan to produce further responses to Plaintiff's
Request for Production of Documents at Deposition, and an Order
for sanctions against Defendant's attorneys for wilfully
obstructing and delaying discovery. Said Motion will be made
upon the grounds that Defendant's Objections to the requested
discovery were wilfully calculated to obstruct discovery, and
delay Plaintiff's case, contrary to Code of Civil Procedure 2031
and it's applicable subsections. Said Motion will be based on
the attached Declaration of Cary W. Goldstein, the Memorandum of
Points and Authorities, and the complete files and records of
this action, as well as any oral testimony at the time of hearing

 Dated: May 3, 1995

 CARY W. GOLDSTEIN,
 Attorney for Plaintiff RUTH TYRANGIEL

 DECLARATION OF CARY W. GOLDSTEIN

 I, CARY W. GOLDSTEIN, declare:

 1. I am an attorney duly licensed to practice law before all of
the courts of this state. I represent the Plaintiff in the
within action, Ruth Tyrangiel. The following is within my
personal knowledge, and if called to so testify, I could and
would competently do so.

 2. The within lawsuit is what is generically known as an action
for "palimony". Plaintiff alleges a relationship with the
Defendant known as "Bob Dylan" of over 20 years, during the
course of which, the parties exchanged promises to always be
there for each other in most every respect, with Defendant
specifically promising to "always take care of" Plaintiff
financially.

 3. In December of 1994, Defendant caused to be served on
Plaintiff a Notice of Taking Deposition accompanied by a Notice
to Produce Documents at the Deposition. A copy of said Notice
served by Defendant is attached and incorporated herein by
reference as "Exhibit A". It will become clear to the Court why
Plaintiff is presenting this fact.

 4. At her deposition, Plaintiff complied with the document
request of Defendant. Plaintiff had many, many boxes of
documents and materials collected over the years in a storage
locker in New York City. She traveled to New York for the
specific purpose of searching the storage facility for materials
in response to Defendant's document request. She was able to
search most of the boxes, but due to time limitations, did not
complete her search at that time, had the remaining boxes
shipped to Los Angeles for the specific purposes of this
lawsuit, and completed her search here, albeit for a few
relevant but insignificant documents which she has produced
subsequent to her deposition.

 5. In addition to the actual documents, were answer machine tape
recordings of the Defendant Dylan, recorded with his knowledge.
The tapes were numerous, and were mixed in with totally
unrelated recordings. Hours of tapes had to be listened to, and
the relevant recordings had to be separated and recorded on
another tape, which Plaintiff has now done. Plaintiff will have
presented those tape recordings to Defendant well before the
hearing of this motion.

 6. Plaintiff has tendered to Defendant each and every item of
discoverable documentary evidence it has requested.

 7. On March 21, 1995, Plaintiff caused to be served on
Defendant a "Notice of Production of Documents at Deposition"
pursuant to C.C.P. 2025(d)(4). A copy of said notice is attached
and incorporated herein as "Exhibit B".

 8. The definitions, instructions and "Documents To Be Produced"
in Plaintiff's request were gleaned, almost word for word, from
Defendant's "Notice to Produce Documents at Deposition" served
on Plaintiff by the Defendant. I did this to insure that
Defendant would not complain of the requests being
objectionable.

 9. Nevertheless, on April 7th, 1995, I was served with
"Objections of Defendant Bob Dylan to Plaintiff Ruth Tyrangiel's
Notice of Production of Documents at Deposition", a copy of
which is attached and incorporated herein by reference as
"Exhibit C".

 10. Defendant sets forth a litany of "GENERAL OBJECTIONS" in
it's response, commencing at page 2, paragraph 4, through page
3, paragraph 12. Those objections are summarized as follows:

 a. Burdensome, overly broad, and not calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence.

 b. Attorney-Client privilege.

 c. An unspecified claimed privilege based on confidentiality
and/or proprietary information.

 d. Misuse of discovery pursuant to C.C.P. 2023(a).

 e. Burdensome, oppressing, harassing and annoying.

 f. Unreasonable time frame.

 g. Plaintiff's discovery incomplete.

 11. The objections of paragraph 10, (item "g", above), even
though inappropriate, can no longer apply, in that Plaintiff's
deposition has taken place, and Plaintiff has complied with
Defendant's document production requests.

 12. As to the objection lodged in paragraph 9, (item "f",
above), Defendant has had approximately six weeks to commence
the search for the requested material, as of the date of the
writing of this declaration, and has made no indication
whatsoever that it has done so. Defendant has not requested an
extension of time within which to respond, which Plaintiff would
have gladly granted. Defendant has not turned over any portion
of the material requested. This is a sham objection.

 13. The following constitutes the individual Requests by
plaintiff and Responses by Defendant

 Requested Item 1 - "All documents, including but not limited to
bank statements and canceled checks, which evidence YOUR banking
practices from January 1, 1974, through the present date."

 Response - "The Preliminary Statement and General
Objections are incorporated herein by reference.
Dylan objects to this request on the ground that
it is vague and ambiguous, overbroad and
propounded for pure harassment purposes. Dylan
further objects on the ground that it seeks
documents that are not relevant to this action or
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. Dylan further objects on the
ground that it seeks information protected by the
attorney- client privilege and/or work product
doctrine. Dylan further objects on the ground that
the request invades and violates Dylan's right to privacy."

 Argument re No. 1

 It should be first noted that this request is identical to
Defendant's request number 9 to Plaintiff, which it compelled
Plaintiff to respond to, and which Plaintiff did in fact respond
The time frame encompassed in this request focuses on the time
frame of the relationship as alleged by Plaintiff. I am informed
and believe and Plaintiff has testified that Defendant
consistently paid for, at least in part, during the majority of
the duration of the 20 year relationship, Plaintiff's living
expenses, and did so by check as well as cash. Defendant denies
this support. The requested documentation is as crucial to
Plaintiff's case as it's absence would be to Defendant's case.

 If these documents are no longer in existence, Defendant should
so state.

 Requested Item 2 - "All documents which evidence any joint
charge accounts or mutually assumed loan obligations entered
into between Ms. Tyrangiel and YOU from January 1, 1974 through
the present date."

 Response - "The Preliminary Statement and General Objections are
incorporated herein by reference. Dylan objects to this request
on the ground that it is vague and ambiguous, overbroad and
propounded for pure harassment purposes. Dylan further objects
on the ground that it seeks documents that are not relevant to
this action or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. Dylan further objects on the ground that it
seeks information protected by the attorney- client privilege
and/or work product doctrine. Dylan further objects on the
ground that the request invades and violates Dylan's right to
privacy."

 Argument re No.2

 This too, was gleaned from Defendant's Request to Plaintiff.
(See Defendant's item number 10.) The same arguments set forth
in Argument to Item No. 1 applies equally herein.

 Requested Item 3 - "All documents which support or tend to
support an agreement between YOU and Ms. Tyrangiel to share any
profits and losses accumulated as a result of Mr. Dylan's
personal talents."

 Response - "The Preliminary Statement and General Objections are
incorporated herein by reference. Dylan objects to this request
on the ground that it is vague and ambiguous, overbroad and
propounded for pure harassment purposes. Dylan further objects
on the ground that it seeks documents that are not relevant to
this action or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. Dylan further objects on the ground that it
seeks information protected by the attorney- client privilege
and/or work product doctrine. Dylan further objects on the
ground that the request invades and violates Dylan's right to
privacy."

 Argument re No. 3

 Plaintiff alleges business relationships with Defendant relating
to their music and Mr. Dylan's art work and investments. Rather
than evade discovery, Defendant should have either stated that
none exist, or if they do, he should have produced them, as
their relevance to this lawsuit is abundantly clear. Rather,
Defendant seeks to obstruct discovery and harass Plaintiff,
delay her case, and force her attorney to bring this within
motion. This too, was copied from Defendant's request to
Plaintiff. Defendant found it relevant to his case, but not
worthy of Plaintiff's case.

 Requested Item 4 - "All documents which support or tend to
support any alleged agreement entered into between YOU and Ms.
Tyrangiel providing for the distribution of Your assets"

 Response "The Preliminary Statement and General
Objections are incorporated herein by
reference. Dylan objects to this request on the
ground that it is vague and ambiguous,
overbroad and propounded for pure harassment
purposes. Dylan further objects on the ground
that it seeks documents that are not relevant
to this action or reasonably calculated to lead
to the discovery of admissible evidence. Dylan
further objects on the ground that it seeks
information protected by the attorney- client
privilege and/or work product doctrine. Dylan
further objects on the ground that the request
invades and violates Dylan's right to privacy."

 Argument re No.4

 This was item number 18 in Defendant's request to Plaintiff.
Plaintiff did not object to this request. The argument set forth
in item number 3 applies equally to item number 4. Why not
respond "No" if that is their response, or produce the obviously
relevant documents? Because Defendant is wilfully seeking to
obstruct and delay discovery by Plaintiff, and the progress of
this case.

 Requested Item 5 - "All documents which evidence payment by YOU
of Ms. Tyrangiel's business and living expenses."

 Response - "The Preliminary Statement and General
Objections are incorporated herein by
reference. Dylan objects to this request on the
ground that it is vague and ambiguous,
overbroad and propounded for pure harassment
purposes. Dylan further objects on the ground
that it seeks documents that are not relevant
to this action or reasonably calculated to lead
to the discovery of admissible evidence. Dylan
further objects on the ground that it seeks
information protected by the attorney- client
privilege and/or work product doctrine. Dylan
further objects on the ground that the request
invades and violates Dylan's right to privacy."

 Argument re No.5

 This too, goes to the heart of Plaintiff's case, and Defendant's
defense. That is apparent, in that it was copied from Item
Number 19 in Defendant's Request to Plaintiff. arguments as set
forth above apply herein.

 Requested Item 6 - "All documents which evidence each different
residential address YOU maintained between January 1, 1974 and
the present date and the period of time YOU spent at each
address."

 Response - "The Preliminary Statement and General Objections are
incorporated herein by reference. Dylan objects to this request
on the ground that it is vague and ambiguous, overbroad and
propounded for pure harassment purposes. Dylan further objects
on the ground that it seeks documents that are not relevant to
this action or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. Dylan further objects on the ground that it
seeks information protected by the attorney- client privilege
and/or work product doctrine. Dylan further objects on the
ground that the request invades and violates Dylan's right to
privacy."

 Argument re No.6 - Plaintiff has presented evidence pursuant to
Defendant's request at deposition regarding Plaintiff's address
for the past twenty years. This goes to an essential allegation
of the complaint. The parties cohabited during the
relationship, a fact which Defendant denies. The location of his
residences is as essential to Plaintiff's case as it is to
Defendant's. Plaintiff has been requested to and has given this
information relating to herself to Defendant. Equal treatment
commands that Defendant do the same

 Requested Item 7 - "All documents that relate to YOUR banking
relationships and accounts YOU maintained from January 1, 1974
to the present date."

 Response - "The Preliminary Statement and General Objections are
incorporated herein by reference. Dylan objects to this request
on the ground that it is vague and ambiguous, overbroad and
propounded for pure harassment purposes. Dylan further objects
on the ground that it seeks documents that are not relevant to
this action or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. Dylan further objects on the ground that it
seeks information protected by the attorney- client privilege
and/or work product doctrine. Dylan further objects on the
ground that the request invades and violates Dylan's right to
privacy."

 Argument re No.7 - This too, was a specific question asked of
Plaintiff by Defendant. (See Defendant's Request No.39.) The
bank records would demonstrate payments to Plaintiff, of which
at the present time, Plaintiff has only partial proof of; that
is copies of some, but not all checks given to her by Mr. Dylan.

 Request Item 8 - "All documents that identify all credit cards
that listed YOU as an authorized signatory from
January 1, 1974 to the present date."-

 Response - "The Preliminary Statement and General Objections are
incorporated herein by reference. Dylan objects to this request
on the ground that it is vague and ambiguous, overbroad and
propounded for pure harassment purposes. Dylan further objects
on the ground that it seeks documents that are not relevant to
this action or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. Dylan further objects on the ground that it
seeks information protected by the attorney- client privilege
and/or work product doctrine. Dylan further objects on the
ground that the request invades and violates Dylan's right to
privacy."

 Argument re No.8 - This is a copy of Defendant's Item Number 40
to Plaintiff. Certainly it was of value to Defendant, otherwise
they would not have requested it. Why would this information not
be of value to Plaintiff?

 Requested Item 9 - "Any and all documents which refer, relate or
pertain to any communications between Defendant and Plaintiff
from January 1, 1974 to the present date."

 Response - "The Preliminary Statement and General Objections are
incorporated herein by reference. Dylan objects to this request
on the ground that it is vague and ambiguous, overbroad and
propounded for pure harassment purposes. Dylan further objects
on the ground that it seeks documents that are not relevant to
this action or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. Dylan further objects on the ground that it
seeks information protected by the attorney- client privilege
and/or work product doctrine. Dylan further objects on the
ground that the request invades and violates Dylan's right to
privacy."

 Argument re No. 9

 This was Defendant's Request No. 43 to Plaintiff, to which
Plaintiff responded with documents and tape recordings. The
requested documents go to evidence of the existence and nature
of the relationship, both which are facts placed in dispute by
Defendant.

 Requested Item 10 - "Any and all documents that refer, relate or
pertain to any travel within or outside the State of California
by Defendant from January 1, 1974 to the present date."

 Response - "The Preliminary Statement and General Objections are
incorporated herein by reference. Dylan objects to this request
on the ground that it is vague and ambiguous, overbroad and
propounded for pure harassment purposes. Dylan further objects
on the ground that it seeks documents that are not relevant to
this action or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. Dylan further objects on the ground that it
seeks information protected by the attorney- client privilege
and/or work product doctrine. Dylan further objects on the
ground that the request invades and violates Dylan's right to
privacy."

 Argument re No. 10 - Plaintiff has alleged that she has traveled
with Defendant on tour many times over the course of the 20 year
relationship. Defendant's counsel extensively grilled Plaintiff
on this particular question in her deposition. This was also
Defendant's specific request number 44. We must now corroborate
her responses with those of Defendants. Why should Defendant be
prepared at the time of trial to attempt to impeach Plaintiff,
and Plaintiff not be afforded the reciprocal right to impeach
Defendant?

 Requested Item 11 - "any and all documents that refer, relate or
pertain to any rental agreements respecting Defendant's place of
residence from January 1, 1974 to the present."

 Response - "The Preliminary Statement and General Objections are
incorporated herein by reference. Dylan objects to this request
on the ground that it is vague and ambiguous, overbroad and
propounded for pure harassment purposes. Dylan further objects
on the ground that it seeks documents that are not relevant to
this action or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. Dylan further objects on the ground that it
seeks information protected by the attorney- client privilege
and/or work product doctrine. Dylan further objects on the
ground that the request invades and violates Dylan's right to
privacy. "

 Argument re No.11

 In this area too, Plaintiff was extensively interrogated in her
deposition. This was correlative to Defendant's request number
46 of Plaintiff. Plaintiff is entitled to oppose Defendant's
arguments regarding Plaintiff's residences during the term of
the relationship.

 Requested Item 12 - "Any and all documents that refer, relate or
pertain to the ownership of any real property by YOU from
January 1, 1974 to the present."

 Response - "The Preliminary Statement and General Objections are
incorporated herein by reference. Dylan objects to this request
on the ground that it is vague and ambiguous, overbroad and
propounded for pure harassment purposes. Dylan further objects
on the ground that it seeks documents that are not relevant to
this action or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. Dylan further objects on the ground that it
seeks information protected by the attorney- client privilege
and/or work product doctrine. Dylan further objects on the
ground that the request invades and violates Dylan's right to
privacy .

 Argument re No. 12

 This was copied from Defendant's request number 47. Plaintiff
responded to this inquiry. Plaintiff alleges in her complaint
that Defendant breached his promise to share with Plaintiff, and
that he would always take care of Plaintiff financially.
Defendant's property holdings, which Plaintiff contends Mr.
Dylan is holding title to in Constructive Trust for Plaintiff,
are an essential elements of proof to Plaintiff's case. Besides,
Defendant believed this to be proper inquiry of Plaintiff; Is
Mr. Dylan different than the rest of us? Is he privileged? Does
he not have to respond as Plaintiff must, and did, in response
to his request that she do so?

 Requested Item 13 - "Any and all diaries, calendars, or daily
logs kept by YOU from the period January 1, 1974 to the
present."

 Response - "The Preliminary Statement and General Objections are
incorporated herein by reference. Dylan objects to this request
on the ground that it is vague and ambiguous, overbroad and
propounded for pure harassment purposes. Dylan further objects
on the ground that it seeks documents that are not relevant to
this action or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. Dylan further objects on the ground that it
seeks information protected by the attorney- client privilege
and/or work product doctrine. Dylan further objects on the
ground that the request invades and violates Dylan's right to
privacy."

 Argument re No. 13

 Plaintiff claims a twenty year relationship with defendant, the
substance of which Defendant denies. Defendant's counsel
extensively questioned Plaintiff regarding diaries at her
deposition, and demanded that she produce what he believed were
diaries. Plaintiff contends that the reasons given by Defendant
for production of Plaintiff's non-existent diaries are valid
reasons for defendant to produce any he may have. This was
Defendant's requested item number 48. Again, is Defendant Dylan
privileged?

 Requested Item 14 - "Any and all documents that refer, relate or
pertain to communications between Defendant and third parties
wherein Plaintiff is referred to or mentioned, including, but
not limited to, copies or correspondence, notes and recordings."

 Response - "The Preliminary Statement and General Objections are
incorporated herein by reference. Dylan objects to this request
on the ground that it is vague and ambiguous, overbroad and
propounded for pure harassment purposes. Dylan further objects
on the ground that it seeks documents that are not relevant to
this action or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. Dylan further objects on the ground that it
seeks information protected by the attorney- client privilege
and/or work product doctrine. Dylan further objects on the
ground that the request invades and violates Dylan's right to
privacy .

 Argument re No. 14

 Plaintiff requests this to prove essential elements of it's
case; that is the nature of the relationship in dispute. This
was Defendant's request number 49 to Plaintiff.

 Requested Item 15 - "Any and all of YOUR bank statements,
including checking and savings from 1974 to the present."

 Response - "The Preliminary Statement and General Objections are
incorporated herein by reference. Dylan objects to this request
on the ground that it is vague and ambiguous, overbroad and
propounded for pure harassment purposes. Dylan further objects
on the ground that it seeks documents that are not relevant to
this action or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. Dylan further objects on the ground that it
seeks information protected by the attorney- client privilege
and/or work product doctrine. Dylan further objects on the
ground that the request invades and violates Dylan's right to
privacy."

 Argument re Item 15

 This was identical to Defendant's requested item number 51. this
information would serve to prove the allegations of support of
Plaintiff by Defendant.

 Requested Item 16 - "Any and all of YOUR investment account
statements from 1974 to the present "

 Response - "The Preliminary Statement and General
Objections are incorporated herein bY reference.
Dylan objects to this request on the ground that
it is vague and ambiguous, overbroad and
propounded for pure harassment purposes. Dylan
further objects on the ground that it seeks documents that are
not relevant to this action or reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of admissible evidence. Dylan further objects on
the ground that it seeks information protected by the attorney-
client privilege and/or work product doctrine. Dylan further
objects on the ground that the request invades and violates
Dylan's right to privacy."

 Argument re Item 16

 Previous arguments regarding the broken promises of Defendant
apply here as well. Plaintiff requires this information in order
to prove her involvement in defendant's financial affairs, and
what is being held in constructive trust by Mr. Dylan for her.

 Requested Item 17 "Any and all documents that reflect payments
made by YOU on Plaintiff's behalf."

 Response - "The Preliminary Statement and General Objections are
incorporated herein by reference. Dylan objects to this request
on the ground that it is vague and ambiguous, overbroad and
propounded for pure harassment purposes. Dylan further objects
on the ground that it seeks documents that are not relevant to
this action or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. Dylan further objects on the ground that it
seeks information protected by the attorney- client privilege
and/or work product doctrine. Dylan further objects on the
ground that the request invades and violates Dylan's right to
privacy."

 Argument re Item 17

 Plaintiff has produced documentation in response to Defendant's
requested item number 54, which is identical to Plaintiff's
within request. This is crucial, essential to Plaintiff's case.
Plaintiff alleges support by Defendant during the course of the
20 year relationship. Plaintiff has presented partial proof of
that fact. Defendant possesses the balance of the documentation,
and should be compelled to produce it.

 Requested Item 18 - "Any and all documents that refer, relate,
pertain or reflect any social functions at which YOU accompanied
Ms. Tyrangiel from January 1, 1974 to the present date."

 Response - "The Preliminary Statement and General
Objections are incorporated herein by
reference. Dylan objects to this request on the
ground that it is vague and ambiguous,
overbroad and propounded for pure harassment purposes. Dylan
further objects on the ground that it seeks documents that are
not relevant to this action or reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of admissible evidence. Dylan further objects on
the ground that it seeks information protected by the attorney-
client privilege and/or work product doctrine. Dylan further
objects on the ground that the request invades and violates
Dylan's right to privacy."

 Argument re Item 18

 This is essential to Plaintiff's proving the extent and nature
of her relationship with Defendant. Defendant obviously found it
to be a pertinent inquiry, as it was his requested item number
55.

 General Argument re Defendant's Repeated Objections

 It is clear that not one question is vague or ambiguous. Each
request is clear as to it's meaning. Defendant's counsel should
understand that...they drafted them. That the same logic
applies to Defendant's claims-of the requests being "overbroad
and propounded for pure harassment purposes." Certainly
Defendant is not claiming it demanded production of those
documents from Plaintiff to harass her. Plaintiff has
demonstrated in each argument above that it's requests are
relevant to the within action, and are reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. None of the
material requested is attorney-client privileged, or is attorney
work product. We regret that Mr. Dylan believes his privacy is
being invaded, but firstly, he is the one who broke the promises
made to Plaintiff, and secondly, he had no concern for
Plaintiff's privacy when he had his counsel interrogate
Plaintiff about the most intimate details of her life.

 14. Defendant's responses to Plaintiff's requests are
nothing but a wilful, intentional ruse to delay discovery. Mr.
Dylan does not like the idea that he must produce detailed
information about his private life, but Ms. Tyrangiel is
likewise not pleased to have to expose the most intimate details
of her life in public to enforce the promises made and broken by
Mr. Dylan. Let him do what is right and not utilize the Court as
his muse. Pay or produce and defend. Mr. Dylan was not dragged
into this battle by Ms. Tyrangiel...she is the disenfranchised
woman left homeless by Mr. Dylan, after 20 years, when he pulled
the plug on her at his whim. She was compelled to fight for what
is rightfully hers after being denied it by the self-important
Defendant.

 15. I declare to the Court that on or about April 16th, I left a
telephone message for defense counsel Gatti on his voice mail
specifically stating that I was calling to discuss his clients
responses to Plaintiff's discovery requests. I then called
again, before preparing this motion, wanting to meet and confer
regarding his client's responses. At that time Mr. Gatti made a
significant step towards resolution of this case by offering to
meet with me to discuss the possibility of settlement. After
three telephone calls between us and Mr. Gatti's partner, "Skip"
Miller, on that day, the proposal for a meeting fell apart, and
it did not take place. Nevertheless, 15 day extensions were
granted mutually to bring any discovery motions which may be
delayed by the meeting.

 16. By correspondence and fax of April 24th, 1995, a copy of
which is attached and incorporated herein as "Exhibit D", I
again attempted to meet and confer with Mr. Gatti. My request
was not responded to.

 17. On May 2, 1995, Mr. Gatti and I met at the Courthouse when
appearing together on the status conference in this matter.
cornered Mr. Gatti and inquired as to how he wishes to proceed
on the discovery issues, particularly further responses to
Plaintiff's document request. He stated that he did not believe
Ms. Tyrangiel was entitled to that documentation, and stood by
his objections. then prepared this motion.

 18. I have spent approximately 6 hours in the preparation of
this Motion, and anticipate that I will spend an additional 2.5
hours in traveling to and from the courthouse and in the actual
hearing of this motion. My usual hourly rate for work of this
sort is $300.00. It is requested that the Court award sanctions
against Defendant and his counsel in the amount of $2,550.00 for
it's wilful obstruction of discovery, in addition to the $14.00
filing fee attendant to this motion.

 SWORN, this 3 day of May, 1995, at Beverly Hills, California,
under the penalty of perjury, that the foregoing is true and
accurate to the best of my knowledge.

 CARY W. GOLDSTEIN, declarant.

 POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

 I.

 PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

 This is an eight count action commonly referred to as a lawsuit
for "palimony". Plaintiff maintained a relationship with the
Defendant known as Bob Dylan for over twenty years. Mr. Dylan
and Plaintiff Tyrangiel exchanged promises as set forth in the
Complaint. Ms. Tyrangiel kept those promises, Mr. Dylan broke
them. Ms. Tyrangiel was disenfranchised by the Defendant,
destitute, and left no alternative but to compel Defendant to
keep his promises regarding sharing and taking care of Plaintiff
by bringing this lawsuit.

 CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE PROHIBITS DISCOVERY ABUSES

 "Code of Civil Procedure 2023. Abuses of Discovery; sanctions

 (a) Misuses of the discovery process include, but are not
limited to, the following: ...

 (5) Making, without substantial justification, an unmeritorious
objection to discovery.

 (6) Making an evasive response to discovery.

 (9) Failing to confer in person, by telephone, or by letter with
an opposing party or attorney in a reasonable and good faith
attempt to resolve informally any dispute concerning discovery,
if the section governing a particular discovery motion requires
the filing of a declaration stating facts showing that such an
attempt has been made. Notwithstanding the outcome of the
particular discovery motion, the court shall impose a monetary
sanction ordering that any party or attorney who fails to confer
as required pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's
fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.

 (b) To the extent authorized by the section governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this
article, the court, after notice to any affected party, person
or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose the
following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a
misuse of the discovery process.

 (1)The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result of
that conduct. The court may also impose this sanction on one
unsuccessfully asserting that another has engaged in the misuse
of the discovery process, or on any attorney who advised that
assertion, or on both. If a monetary sanction is authorized by
any provision of this article, the court shall impose the
sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.

 III.

 CONCLUSION

 As set forth in the attached Declaration of Cary W. Goldstein,
each and every item requested by Plaintiff is clearly within the
reasonable boundaries of discovery. The Court is reminded that
each of Plaintiff's eighteen requests were taken specifically
from Defendant's sixty five requests for production to
Plaintiff.

 Defendant demanded that Plaintiff respond to that discovery,
claiming it was essential to the preparation of it's case for
trial. We agree, it was. In an effort to not hide any facts,
Plaintiff capitulated to Defendant's inquiries into the most
personal aspects of Plaintiff's life.

 Plaintiff now requires the same information. It is essential to
her preparation for trial. Defendant's objections are merely a
sham to obstruct discovery and delay this case from moving
forward. It is unfortunate that Mr. Dylan is not happy about
this case, but neither is Ms. Tyrangiel. Certainly, as between
the parties, Mr. Dylan presently is placed in a far more
comfortable position than Plaintiff, the woman left with nothing
at the whim of Mr. Dylan.

 The information requested by Plaintiff is essential to her
preparing this case for trial. Defendant has requested and
received this information from Plaintiff. Plaintiff should not
be denied the opportunity to litigate her case on equal ground
with Defendant.

 Dated: MaY 3. 1995

 Respectfully submitted,

 CARY W. GOLDSTIEN
 Attorney for Plaintiff Ruth Tyrangiel.

STATE OF NEW YORK )
COUNTY OF NEW YORK)

IAS Part 19
(Hon. Edward H. Lehner)

AFFIDAVIT OF LEONARD
M. MARKS IN SUPPORT
OF MOTION TO
DISCONTINUE ACTION

LEONARD M. MARKS, being duly sworn, deposes and says:

 1. I am a member of the firm of Gold, Farrell & Marks, attorneys
for plaintiffs in this action. I submit this affidavit in
support of plaintiffs' motion pursuant to CPLR 3217(b) for an
order discontinuing without prejudice the above-captioned action
against the three remaining defendants. The Court's
determination of this motion requires a full and accurate
summation of the extensive and acrimonious litigations that Mr.
Joel has endured for over five years.

 Preliminary Statement

 2. Plaintiffs are moving to discontinue this lawsuit because
settlement agreements, which this Court has long encouraged the
parties to make, have been reached with every party except three
defendants, Richard London, The Cash Digest Company, Ltd., and
Loco Productions, Inc. (the "London defendants"), none of whom
has any material assets.

 3. Although plaintiffs believe that they have meritorious claims
against the London defendants, through discovery and motion
practice plaintiffs have ascertained that none has sufficient
assets or resources to satisfy judgments that could be entered
against them if litigation were to proceed. As such, plaintiffs
seek to end this litigation and stop expending the time, costs
and resources required to pursue the sole remaining, and
relatively minor, piece of this five-year old pending lawsuit.

 4. Plaintiffs previously sought to obtain the same
discontinuance that plaintiffs seek through this motion by
entering into a stipulation with the London defendants. However,
the London defendants refused to agree and, even though they do
not have a single pending counterclaim against plaintiffs in
this lawsuit, through their representatives, have asked for
substantial sums from Mr. Joel in order to resolve this case.

 5. To appreciate why it is particularly appropriate for this
litigation to be discontinued now, it is important to place in
context the events that have transpired since Mr. Joel
terminated Frank Weber as his manager and severed his relation
with Messrs. Weber and London, Frank Management and a host of
Weber-related companies and Weber in late 1989. In the aftermath
of Weber's termination, there have been no less than eight
separate litigations, including two major lawsuits that Mr. Joel
has brought in this Court against a total of 37 defendants. Mr.
Joel has recovered millions of dollars on his claims and has
eliminated forever Frank Management's and Weber's Bankruptcy
Trustee's claims for commissions totalling as high as
$15,000,000.

 6. These results did not come easily. Mr. Joel has engaged in
litigation not only in New York, but also in the state courts of
Virginia and Georgia (where he successfully caused the dismissal
of claims brought by Weber) and in Bankruptcy Courts in
Virginia, Washington and New York. These various proceedings
have involved dozens of motions, dozens of depositions, hundreds
of interrogatories, and hundreds of thousands of documents.
After all of this litigation, there is no reason to require
plaintiffs to continue this litigation against the three
remaining, essentially assetless, defendants, none of whom has
any pending claims whatsoever against plaintiffs in this
lawsuit. The only claim against plaintiffs that they ever
asserted, for defamation, was entirely dismissed by the Court at
the pleading stage.

 7. A discontinuance will also eliminate the need to resolve the
London defendants' recently asserted indemnification cross-
claims, which they have brought against Weber, Frank Management
and eleven other defendants with whom plaintiffs have already
reached settlements. The London defendants' effort to expand
this litigation at this stage of the proceedings is outrageous.

 8. Equally indefensible is the London defendants' refusal to
provide any discovery in the nearly two months that have passed
since the Court ordered them to respond to interrogatories and
produce documents called for by discovery requests plaintiffs
served six months ago. As discussed in detail below, the London
defendants' disregard for their discovery obligations in this
lawsuit has forced plaintiffs to make repeated motions to compel
discovery in order to obtain the most basic discovery, including
Mr. London's own deposition. Accordingly, in addition to
plaintiffs' request for relief under CPLR 3217(b), plaintiffs
also request that the London defendants' answer be stricken and
a default judgment entered against them under CPLR 3126(3) for
their failure to comply with this Court's Order of January 20,
1995.

 9. In addition to the foregoing, the continuing false and
misleading statements that the London defendants and some of the
other former defendants have made about Mr. Joel and the
resolution of claims that he has asserted constitutes another
reason to put a stop to this litigation and correct the record.

 10. If this case is not discontinued, its trial would likely
take more than two months and involve the testimony of dozens of
witnesses. Among the causes of action that plaintiffs have
asserted against Mr. London are claims that he aided and abetted
Weber's and FMI's frauds and breaches of fiduciary duty over a
nine-year period. Plaintiffs' proof of these claims alone will
involve the introduction of evidence of both Mr. London's
assistance and Weber's and FMI's frauds and fiduciary duty
breaches during the entire period of Weber's management of Mr.
Joel. Under the circumstances, there is no reason to hold such a
lengthy trial against these three essentially assetless
defendants.

 Procedural Background

 11. This lawsuit was commenced on or about September 25, 1989,
when plaintiffs served a summons and complaint on Richard
London, The Cash Digest Company, Ltd., and Loco Productions,
Inc. (collectively, the "London defendants"), and on 28 other
defendants, including Weber and FMI. Through this action,
plaintiffs have not only stopped, but have also reversed the
financial ruin that faced Mr. Joel before he terminated Weber.

 12. Plaintiffs brought this action to recover damages for, inter
alia, fraud and breach of fiduciary duty and to obtain a
declaratory judgment that a Management Agreement between Mr.
Joel and defendants Frank Weber ("Weber") and his wholly owned
company Frank Management, Inc. ("FMI") was properly terminated
for cause. Mr. Joel terminated the Management Agreement just as
Weber was about to obligate Mr. Joel on an additional $6 million
loan which undoubtedly would have only added to the spiraling
financial ruin Weber and the other defendants were causing Mr.
Joel.

 13. As detailed in the Fifth Amended and Supplemental Complaint
(the "Complaint"), which is attached hereto as Exhibit A, from
the onset of the management relationship between Mr. Joel and
Weber/FMI in 1980, and continuing without interruption until Mr.
Joel fired them in 1989, Weber was a fiduciary who abused his
position of trust and confidence as Mr. Joel's manager to
further Weber's interests, and Mr. London participated in this
wrongdoing. Among other things, Weber was charged with (i)
misappropriating to himself and his wife hundreds of thousands
of dollars of Mr. Joel's money as so-called "interest free
loans", without Mr. Joel's authorization or consent, and failing
to repay such sums, (ii) repeatedly using Mr. Joel's funds as a
source for unrepaid, so-called "loans", aggregating well over
$1,000,000, to partnerships and companies in which Weber had
invested Mr. Joel's funds and in which Weber or his companies
had interests as either a general or limited partner or
stockholder, and (iii) using millions of dollars of Mr. Joel's
funds as a source of funding for Weber personally and for
numerous Weber-controlled partnerships and companies (including
various companies in which Mr. London himself had an ownership
interest). Messrs. London and Weber were charged with failing to
disclose and actively concealing these abuses from Mr. Joel
through systematic nondisclosures and misrepresentations.

 14. The gravamen of the complaint against Mr. London is, inter
alia, that he breached fiduciary duties that he owed to Mr.
Joel, that he aided and abetted Weber's wrongdoing, and that he
received a fraudulent conveyance of, and participated in the
conversion of, Mr. Joel's partnership distributions.

 15. Defendants in the Weber action resisted discovery, forced
plaintiffs to wade through an enormous warehouse of documents
maintained by Weber (without producing specific documents in
response to plaintiffs' discovery requests) and, together with
the defendants in the related Grubman action, forced Mr. Joel
to sit for numerous days of deposition.

 16. In spite of these efforts, virtually every ruling made on
the merits of this action has been favorable to the plaintiffs.
Among the more significant of these rulings are the following:

 (i) Prior to any discovery, and over defendants' vigorous
opposition, plaintiffs were awarded partial summary judgment in
March 1990 on the Twelfth through Eighteenth Causes of Action in
the Complaint -- resulting in judgments of more than $2,000,000
on claims that plaintiffs asserted against Weber personally, his
wife Lucille Weber, and five companies that were controlled by
Weber. Plaintiffs claim that with respect to one of these
companies, defendant IMC, Mr. London himself was an officer and
a director, and, in such capacity, he performed the bidding of
Weber, in spite of Mr. Joel's best interest;

 (ii) Plaintiffs completely defeated Weber's, Frank Management's
and the London defendants' cross-motion for partial summary
judgment in March 1990 seeking dismissal of, inter alia, the
fraud, conversion and other tortious claims that Mr. Joel had
asserted;

 (iii) Mr. Joel obtained a restraining order in April 1990,
pursuant to New York Debtor & Creditor Law 279, that barred
Weber and his wife from transferring the proceeds of the sale of
property titled in Lucille Weber's name and located in Lloyd
Harbor, New York. Mr. Joel contended that Weber fraudulently
conveyed funds to his wife that were used to purchase this
property and build a luxurious 9,000-plus square foot home on it-
- and the Court specifically found that Mr. Joel had
established a "prima facie" fraudulent transfer by Weber;

 (iv) In October 1991, Mr. Joel obtained an order of attachment
against Frank Weber and Frank Management for stealing $675,670
of partnership distributions due to Mr. Joel between February
and June 1990 -- i.e., well after the commencement of this
action and oral argument of Mr. Joel's successful motion for
partial summary judgment (and in some cases after the entry of
such judgments);

 (v) Plaintiffs successfully moved to dismiss defamation
counterclaims that defendants London and FMI asserted against
plaintiffs in defendants' Amended Answer and Counterclaims,
dated October 31, 1990. In its January 8, 1991 decision granting
the dismissal, the Court expressly found the utter lack of merit
of these counterclaims to be "clear and free from doubt". No
other counterclaims have ever been asserted by any of the London
Defendants. As such, they have no claims against plaintiffs at
stake here; and

 (vi) Plaintiffs successfully won the dismissal of FMI's tortious
interference complaint against Mr. Joel's former wife, Christie
Brinkley, in March 1992.

 17. In addition, lawsuits brought by FMI against Mr. Joel in
1989 and 1990, one in Virginia and one in Georgia, were each
dismissed in 1990. In each of those lawsuits, FMI asserted
claims against Mr. Joel in excess of $10,000,000. Weber caused
these lawsuits to be brought in a baseless attempt to evade the
New York courts in the wake of the massive judgments awarded to
Joel at the start of this lawsuit. After the Virginia action was
dismissed -- and while FMI's appeal of that dismissal was
pending -- Weber caused Joel to be served with process in the
ill-fated Georgia action while Joel was performing at a concert
in Atlanta.

 18. Mr. Joel also brought a closely-related lawsuit against his
former attorneys, Grubman, Indursky and Schindler, which arose
out of their relationship with Weber and numerous Weber-
controlled companies (the "Grubman action"). Indeed, discovery
proceedings, conferences and motions were conducted jointly for
the Weber and Grubman lawsuits and the first seven days of
Joel's deposition were taken at the offices of the Grubman
defendants' attorneys. Among others, Messrs. Weber and London
and Grubman law partners attended all or some of these
deposition sessions.

 Settlements Reached

 19. After more than five years of litigation, settlements have
been reached with all thirty-seven defendants in the Grubman and
Weber actions, except the three London defendants.

 20. Significantly, in early 1994, after having reached
settlements with all defendants other than the London defendants
and the twenty Weber defendants -- all of whom were then
represented by the same attorneys, counsel for the remaining
parties spent months trying to reach a global resolution of all
remaining claims in the litigation. [FN1] Late in this process,
the London defendants decided not to join in that settlement.
Accordingly, while leaving open plaintiffs' claims against the
London defendants, the settlement agreement which was ultimately
executed fully resolved all of the causes of action asserted
against the twenty Weber defendants as well as FMI's
counterclaim against Mr. Joel (the "Weber Settlement"). At the
time of the Weber Settlement, which was executed by plaintiffs,
the Weber defendants and Weber's bankruptcy trustee in June
1994, plaintiffs had already been awarded judgments against the
Weber defendants of approximately $3,000,000 (and had already
recovered nearly $1,000,000 on their claims against them).

 21. The Weber Settlement relinquished forever Frank
Weber's/Frank Management's claim for post-termination
commissions -- which sought as much as 20+ of all of Mr. Joel's
gross revenues in the entertainment industry, including his
gross revenues from past and future sales of all of his top
selling CBS/Sony recordings. Frank Management's counterclaim was
valued as high as $15,000,000.

 22. Although the London defendants were offered the opportunity
to join in the Weber Settlement, at no cost to them, they chose
not to do so. Thereafter, the London defendants also refused to
either (i) exchange releases in order to end the litigation
against them, despite the fact that they have no claims against
plaintiffs and have insufficient assets to satisfy any judgment
entered against them if this litigation were to proceed, or (ii)
stipulate to a voluntary discontinuance of the remaining claims
on a without prejudice basis. Further, because the London
defendants have sought substantive sums from Mr. Joel for such a
release -- even though they have no claims whatever against Mr.
Joel in this lawsuit -- the Court's intervention is required for
plaintiffs to discontinue this lawsuit. [FN2]

 23. Additionally, the London defendants, as a litigation tactic,
have submitted court papers in this action that mischaracterize
both the Weber Settlement and facts relating to that settlement.
This is yet another reason why this lawsuit should be
discontinued now and why it is important to correctly describe
the facts pertinent to the Weber settlement, including
significant proceedings in Weber's personal bankruptcy case.
Weber filed for personal bankruptcy in May 1990 and his
bankruptcy filings listed assets of $651,968.08 and liabilities
of $23,701,003, which did not include the significant amounts he
owed to Mr. Joel. In addition, Weber's filings listed more than
300 unpaid creditors.

 24. Weber's bankruptcy trustee (the "Trustee") indicated, at a
very early stage of the bankruptcy case, a strong interest in
pursuing, on behalf of the bankruptcy estate, Weber's claims
against Mr. Joel for commissions. In this regard, in November
1991, the Trustee entered into a settlement agreement with Weber
and various others against whom the Trustee had already filed
fraudulent conveyance and preference claims. The agreement
provided for, inter alia, the assignment of a percentage
interest in the Weber/FMI commission counterclaim to the Trustee
and a minimum guarantee that the Trustee would receive at least
$300,000. The agreement, which required Bankruptcy Court
approval in order to become operative, also provided for the
Trustee to discontinue the three fraudulent conveyance and
preference lawsuits that he had already filed against Lucille
Weber, Frank Management and Mr. London, among others

 25. In support of the Trustee's application to the Bankruptcy
Court for approval of the settlement, pursuant to Bankruptcy
Rule 9019, the Trustee stated that the chance of Weber's
creditors obtaining any recovery in the Weber bankruptcy "hinged
primarily" on the value of Weber's commission claims against Mr.
Joel. (Application of Bankruptcy Trustee for Approval of a
Stipulation of Settlement, dated November 19, 1991, p. 8.)
Significantly, however, even though Bankruptcy Rule 9019 has
been construed to merely require a Trustee to show that his
settlement satisfies a minimal level of reasonableness in order
to win approval, the Trustee's application was denied. The
Bankruptcy Court, at oral argument, expressed its concerns over
the agreement, noting that the Trustee was seeking to trade his
filed preference and fraudulent conveyance claims in exchange
for litigation of FMI's commission claim against Mr. Joel --
with respect to which the Court stated that the Trustee had
shown, after a full year of investigation, nothing to reflect
the value of such claim or any reason why the Trustee thought it
had "a lot of merit."

 26. Notwithstanding the defeat of his November 1991 application,
the Trustee continued to express interest in pursuing claims
against Mr. Joel to gain money for the Weber creditors.
Moreover, since Mr. Joel had already recovered nearly $1,000,000
in connection with his claims against Weber, Lucille Weber and
Weber-controlled companies and partnerships, there was also a
possibility that the Trustee (or Weber's creditors) might claim
that the funds that Mr. Joel had already recovered should
instead be made available for all of Weber's creditors.

 27. Accordingly, to avoid any extended litigation in the
bankruptcy court -- whether against the Trustee or other of
Weber's 300 creditors -- and to obtain a full and complete
release from Weber, FMI and the Trustee with respect to the
commission claim asserted against Mr. Joel (which sought as much
as $15 million), Mr. Joel settled with the Trustee and the Weber
defendants by paying $562,500 -- all of which was paid to the
Trustee. Obviously, this payment was substantially below the
nearly $1,000,000 that Mr. Joel had already successfully
recovered on the claims that he had asserted against the Weber
defendants.

 28. On July 6, 1994, following a hearing, the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of New York, approved
the Weber Settlement. [FN3] Pursuant to the terms of the Weber
Settlement, counsel for plaintiffs and the Weber defendants
executed a stipulation of discontinuance of all claims by
plaintiffs against the Weber defendants and FMI's counterclaim
against plaintiffs. Because the London defendants refused to
sign this stipulation, it could not be used to discontinue
plaintiffs' claims against the Weber defendants or FMI's
counterclaim. See CPLR 3217(a) (requiring all remaining parties
to an action -- i.e., both settling and non-settling parties --
to sign stipulation of discontinuance).

 29. Despite Mr. London's lack of any meritorious objection to
the Weber Settlement, his refusal to join in this stipulation
required that the parties move to discontinue the claims and
counterclaims covered by the Weber Settlement. The Weber
defendants made such a motion on or about October 1994, and
plaintiffs supported the motion. Rejecting the London
defendants' baseless opposition, the Court signed an Order
granting the Weber Discontinuance on or about December 19, 1994
(Exhibit B hereto).

 30. I am advised that Mr. Weber, through his representatives,
planted a New York magazine article about the Weber Settlement,
which was inaccurate and designed to defame Mr. Joel.

 31. In addition to the repeated attacks on Mr. Joel by the
London defendants and the Weber defendants, I have recently
learned that Allen Grubman, Esq. has also made such attacks. By
making these attacks, Mr. Grubman has deliberately breached the
confidentiality provisions of his settlement agreement with Mr.
Joel in the Grubman action, which bars any statements whatsoever
by Mr. Grubman. Moreover, Mr. Grubman has falsely described the
resolution of the action against him and, in the course of doing
so, Mr. Grubman has defamed me and my law firm.

 32. Thus, a reporter for a major publication recently told me
that Mr. Grubman told that reporter that he had won a "total
victory" over Mr. Joel and that Mr. Joel's "baseless" and
"frivolous" complaint against Mr. Grubman was "totally
defeated", that Mr. Grubman "won" the case and that there had
been "no settlement" of any kind. Mr. Grubman's statements were
not only absolutely false, but also in blatant violation of the
confidentiality provision. These ongoing attacks on Mr. Joel
further motivate this application to finally end the remaining
piece of the multiple litigations brought in the aftermath of
Weber's termination and force us to set forth accurately what
occurred.

 33. The Verified Complaint in the Grubman action, attached
hereto as Ex. C, charged Allen J. Grubman, his partners and his
law firm (the "Grubman defendants"), who represented Mr. Joel
while Weber acted as his manager, with, inter alia, (i) paying
kickbacks to Frank Management and to Weber's related company,
Computerized Business Management Services, Inc. ("CBMS"), that
were disguised as payments for non-existent "tax" and
"consulting" services; (ii) at Weber's request, investing
hundreds of thousands of dollars in Weber-controlled
partnerships because of their fear that Weber would fire them as
Mr. Joel's attorneys if they did not invest; (iii) at Weber's
request, lending $250,000 to a Weber-owned company at a time
when defendants anticipated that Weber would cause Mr. Joel to
pay them fees of hundreds of thousands of dollars in connection
with the negotiation of Mr. Joel's agreements with CBS; (iv)
failing to investigate Weber's and Frank Management's handling
of Mr. Joel's finances, even after Walter Yetnikoff, while he
was President and CEO of CBS Records, told Allen Grubman, as Mr.
Joel's attorney, that "something was wrong" and that an
investigation should be made, because Grubman believed that
Weber would fire him as Mr. Joel's attorney if such an
investigation was suggested or initiated; (v) failing to advise
Mr. Joel of Weber's dishonesty and lack of fitness to serve as
Mr. Joel's manager, even after Tommy Mottola, who was another
investor in Weber partnerships, told Grubman that Weber had
stated his willingness to have a horse owned by a Weber-
controlled entity killed in order to commit insurance fraud, and
(vi) failing to advise Mr. Joel of Grubman's conflicts of
interest arising from his simultaneous representation of Mr.
Joel, CBS/Sony (which was the record company for whom Mr. Joel's
albums were recorded) and CBS/Sony executives. The Verified
Complaint alleges that Mr. Joel was not informed by the Grubman
defendants about any of the foregoing.

 34. In stark contradiction to Mr. Grubman's false and defamatory
statements, court-filed contemporaneous documents and a detailed
memorandum of a Weber criminal investigation interview by the
FBI conducted of Messrs. Grubman and Indursky (which includes
numerous of their admissions), substantiate the charges asserted
in the lawsuit.

 35. In further contrast to Mr. Grubman's false and defamatory
statements, Mr. Joel only agreed to discontinue the claims he
asserted in the Grubman lawsuit in return for $3 million.

 36. The extraordinary circumstances in which the settlement was
reached deeply involved the Grubman defendants and executives at
the highest level of Sony. Virtually every settlement agreement
draft was transmitted by counsel for Mr. Joel and the Grubman
defendants through the office of Sony. One early settlement
agreement draft reflected that the Grubman defendants would pay,
or cause to be paid, millions of dollars to Mr. Joel. Because
the Grubman defendants did not want the settlement agreement to
refer to the payment of the millions of dollars that Mr. Joel
required in order to discontinue his claims, the settlement
agreement was revised. The payments to Mr. Joel were funneled
through Sony, which entered into "agreements" with Mr. Joel at
the identical time that the settlement agreement between the
parties in the Grubman action was signed. It was understood that
the contemporaneous agreements between the Grubman defendants
and Mr. Joel and Sony and Mr. Joel must be concluded
simultaneously or none would be operative.

 London's Repeated Misconduct During Discovery

 37. Throughout this litigation both the Weber and the London
defendants have orchestrated a continuing string of discovery
abuses. For example, and specifically with regard to Mr. London,
despite plaintiffs' proper service of a Notice of Deposition and
accompanying document demand scheduling Mr. London's deposition
for March 7, 1994, Mr. London, who was then represented by
Anthony Conforti, Esq. and Patrick Monaghan, Esq., deliberately
failed to appear for his deposition or to produce documents and
failed to seek a protective order.

 38. As a result of Mr. London's unexcused non- appearance on
March 11, 1994, plaintiffs brought a motion to, inter alia,
strike Mr. London's answer and have a default judgment entered
against him based upon his failure to appear on March 7, 1994.
In the alternative, plaintiffs sought an order directing Mr.
London to appear in plaintiffs' attorneys' office on a specified
date for his deposition and for said deposition to continue from
day to day until completed.

 39. While this motion was before the Court, Mr. London's
attorney advised my office in writing that Mr. London would be
available on May 5, 1994 for deposition and requested that
plaintiffs confirm the May 5th date. By letter dated March 15,
1994, we wrote to Mr. London's attorney and accepted the
proposed May 5th date. In addition, we confirmed the May 5th
date in letters to Mr. London's counsel dated April 25, 1994 and
May 3, 1994.

 40. Despite (i) the unambiguous written record fixing Mr.
London's deposition for May 5th, (ii) his unexcused failure to
appear on March 7th for his deposition, and (iii) the pendency
of plaintiffs' motion to strike Mr. London's answer and enter a
default judgment against him for his failure to appear on March
7th, Mr. London again inexcusably failed to appear for his
deposition on May 5th. Further, despite plaintiffs' written
request that defendant London advise plaintiffs if Mr. London
did not plan to appear and plaintiffs' warning that plaintiffs
would hold defendants accountable for any court reporting fee if
he failed to appear, no such advice was provided -- thereby
forcing plaintiffs to incur an otherwise avoidable court
reporting fee for which reimbursement has not been made.

 41. On May 10th, 1994, we wrote to Mr. London's then counsel,
Patrick Monaghan, Esq., to complain about Mr. London's second
default in appearing for his deposition on May 5, 1994, and to
notify him that plaintiffs planned to supplement their pending
default judgment and sanctions motion against Mr. London
accordingly. Ten days later, on May 20, 1994, Mr. Monaghan
informed both the Court and my office that Mr. London was in the
process of retaining new counsel, and that Mr. London would
appear in New York for deposition before the end of June.

 42. On June 2, 1994, my office received a Consent To Change
Attorney form from London's present counsel, John Bracken, Esq.,
with a request that counsel speak to arrange dates for Mr.
London's deposition. On June 3, 1994, our office both spoke and
wrote to Mr. Bracken in order to schedule the deposition.
Pursuant to that schedule, the first segment of Mr. London's
deposition was taken in our offices on July 11-15. At the end of
that segment, counsel agreed to schedule the remainder of Mr.
London's deposition.

 43. Over the next few weeks, counsel for both parties attempted
to negotiate a discontinuance acceptable to our respective
clients. On August 1, 1994, when said discussions were abandoned
without success, we wrote to Mr. Bracken's office with a request
for dates to continue Mr. London's deposition. This request was
renewed on August 5, 1994.

 44. On August 10, 1994, Mr. Bracken's office advised us that Mr.
London's deposition could not be resumed until the week of
September 12, 1994, because Mr. London was on a European
vacation. [FN4] Although plaintiffs wanted to depose Mr. London
earlier, our efforts to advance the resumption of Mr. London's
deposition were unconditionally rejected. Accordingly, Mr.
London's deposition did not resume until the week of September
15th.

 45. The bulk of Mr. London's answers during his deposition were
prefaced by disclaimers such as "I do not recall", "I believe",
or some other equivocation. Thus, plaintiffs were forced to seek
to supplement his testimony through interrogatories and document
requests, which were served on the London defendants on or about
October 13, 1994.

 46. Although the information sought in these discovery notices
is material and necessary to plaintiffs' claims against London
and has not previously been provided, Mr. London made legally
and factually flawed arguments in an unsuccessful attempt to
quash the interrogatories and document requests. By Order dated
January 20, 1995 (Exhibit D hereto), this Court denied the
London defendants' motion for a protective order against
plaintiffs' October 1994 discovery requests. Nevertheless, and
true to their chronic pattern of disregarding their discovery
obligations, the London defendants have not produced any
documents or responded to any interrogatories. [FN5]

 47. The London defendants simply cannot have it both ways here
by obstructing discovery while also opposing either a settlement
or a discontinuance. As a result of this conduct, and in
addition to the relief that plaintiffs' seek under CPLR 3217(b),
plaintiffs also seek an Order striking the London Defendants'
answer and entering a default judgment against them pursuant to
CPLR 3126(3+.

 Merits of the London Action

 48. Although plaintiffs have no desire to continue to litigate
against the three remaining defendants -- none of which has
sufficient assets to satisfy any judgments -- plaintiffs, if
forced to litigate here, believe that it is likely that
judgments would be obtained against the London defendants. As
the partial list of examples set forth below demonstrates, as a
result of plaintiffs' discovery of Mr. London and others, many
facts supporting plaintiffs' claims against Mr. London are
clearly established.

 49. Defendant London was Mr. Joel's tour manager for many years
and, like Weber, had many conflicting positions:

 * He was an officer of defendant Frank Management, Inc., ("Frank
Management"), the company that managed Joel -- and against which
Joel won a judgment in 1993.

 * He was a director, officer and shareholder of defendant
International Management Communications, Inc. ("IMC") -- a
company against which Joel has won a judgment in this lawsuit in
1990.

 * He was an officer, director and/or owner of defendant
Hicksville Productions, Inc. (and its predecessor company,
Picturevision, Inc.) -- in which Joel was also an owner and,
unknown to Joel, a creditor.

 * He was the majority owner of defendant Cash Digest, which,
inter alia, (i) served repeatedly as a conduit for funds that
were loaned -- without Joel's knowledge -- from Joel or Joel's
pension plan to Weber controlled partnerships and to a senior
executive at Joel's record company, and (ii) maintained the
books and record for plaintiffs, Frank Management and virtually
every one of Weber's partnerships and companies.

 * He was the sole Trustee of Joel's pension funds from October
1981 until Weber's termination in 1989 -- and, in such capacity,
caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans to be made
without Joel's knowledge to Weber and to partnerships and
companies that Weber controlled.

 * He was a signatory on a bank account of plaintiff Electric
Company Productions, Inc. ("Electric Company") and, inter alia,
signed one or more checks pursuant to which Electric Company --
without Joel's knowledge -- lent hundreds of thousands of
dollars to Weber-controlled ventures.

 * He was the 100% owner of Loco Productions, Inc., a company that
made repeated, undisclosed loans of monies earned through Joel's
touring efforts, which monies London himself admitted belonged
to Joel.

 50. Further, through Mr. London's own deposition testimony and
documents produced during the litigation to date, the following
picture of London's misdeeds has emerged:

 IMC

 * Mr. London, as a shareholder, officer, director and consultant
to defendant IMC, devoted approximately one-third of his
business time to IMC matters. London Tr. at 484, 521, 629-30 and
640. [FN6]

 * Despite Mr. London's extensive involvement in IMC's operations
and management, and his officer position in Frank Management, he
does not recall ever discussing Mr. Joel's equity investment in
IMC directly with Mr. Joel. London Tr. at 496-497. Mr. London
also does not recall ever reviewing IMC's financial statements
with Mr. Joel. London Tr. at 485.

 * Although Mr. London did not dispute that IMC sought and
obtained repeated loans from Mr. Joel throughout Mr. London's
tenure as an officer, director, shareholder and consultant to
IMC, see London Tr. at 898, Mr. London could not recall ever
discussing any of those loans -- or IMC's failure to repay them-
- with Mr. Joel. See London Tr. at 516-520, 538, 679-682. Mr.
Joel was awarded partial summary judgment against IMC in 1990 in
respect of loans that IMC took from Mr. Joel while Mr. London
was a director and officer of IMC.

 * Despite the fact that IMC was never a profitable company,
virtually never had sufficient cash flow to meet its operating
costs, and Mr. London admitted that he had concerns about IMC's
financial viability, Mr. London could not recall ever discussing
the disastrous financial health of IMC with Mr. Joel or
reporting his concerns to Mr. Joel. London Tr. at 539-40, 549-
550.

 * At a time when Mr. London knew that financially troubled IMC
could not pay its debts to creditors, including Mr. Joel,
Messrs. London and Weber demanded that IMC repay all outstanding
loans that Mr. Joel had made to the company -- all of which were
made without Mr. Joel's knowledge. London Tr. at 741- 42, 777-
778, 785. Mr. London did not recall whether any of the
outstanding notes were paid in response to this demand, London
Tr. at 789, nor could he recall discussing the decision to
demand payment -- or the failure to previously demand repayment-
- with Mr. Joel. London Tr. at 747.

 * Even after IMC failed to repay loans taken from Mr. Joel in
response to the demand for repayment, IMC continued to secretly
obtain additional loans from Mr. Joel to pay for, inter alia,
IMC's legal costs in connection with a lawsuit against
Billboard. Not only did Mr. London not recall ever discussing
these additional loans with Mr. Joel, but also he did not recall
telling Mr. Joel that his money was being taken in order to
finance litigation against Billboard. See London Tr. at 780-782,
792 and 797-800.

 * In or about July 1988, IMC settled the lawsuit with Billboard.
Pursuant to the settlement, IMC assigned all of its remaining
operations to Billboard for a $290,000 payment to be made in
October 1988 and a $100,000 payment to be made in October 1989.
London Tr. at 807-814. Without disclosing this settlement to Mr.
Joel, Mr. London caused IMC to pay approximately $270,000 of the
initial $290,000 settlement payment to Frank Management. London
Tr. at 845-853, 859. Mr. London himself signed the IMC checks
transferring the $270,000 to Frank Management. (Ex. F hereto).
Mr. Joel did not receive any of the $290,000, despite the fact
that IMC owed him more than $100,000 at the time (including
thousands of dollars in overdue interest). See London Tr. at
869. Mr. London did not tell Mr. Joel about the settlement with
Billboard or IMC's payments to Frank Management.

 Joel's Pension Plan

 * Mr. London became Trustee of the Electric Company pension
plans in October 1981. See Weber Tr. at 1647. [FN7] As Trustee
of the Electric Company pension plans -- with respect to which
Mr. Joel was the sole beneficiary (except for a brief period
when Mr. Joel's first wife was also a beneficiary) -- Mr. London
approved and authorized pension funds to be loaned, without Mr.
Joel's knowledge, to Frank Weber, personally, and to various
Weber-controlled companies (London Tr. at 228, 249, 1234- 1236),
including Weber-controlled horse partnerships (London Tr. at
234, 250, 992, 1013-1017). Mr. London caused Joel's pension plan
to make these loans despite the fact that he considered such
partnerships to be speculative, and despite the fact that he
admittedly had a fiduciary duty to the pension plans and their
beneficiaries. See London Tr. at 230, 234; Pantzis Tr. at 262-
72. [FN8] Further, Patricia (Meagher) Murray, who was employed
by FMI throughout the relevant period, testified that by 1987 it
was common knowledge around the FMI office that all of the
Weber- controlled horse partnerships were in financial trouble.
Murray Tr. at 157. [FN9] In addition, the former chief financial
employee of Cash Digest and controller of FMI, James Pantzis,
testified that Mr. London disfavored the horse partnership loans
that Weber caused Joel to make and knew that the loans were in
default. Pantzis Tr. at 262-72. Nonetheless, Mr. London could
not recall discussing any of these loans with Mr. Joel. See,
e.q., London Tr. at 987.

 * Payments of principal and interest that were due on various
loans of Joel's pension funds, including loans made to Weber
personally, were not paid when due. Even so, Mr. London did not
disclose either the existence of these loans to Mr. Joel or
Weber's and Weber's companies' failure to make timely payments
of their obligations. See, e.q., London Tr. at 987.

 * As Trustee of the Electric Company pension plans, Mr. London
authorized the loan of $300,000 in pension funds to Cash Digest,
a company of which Mr. London was the majority owner. London Tr.
at 119-124. Mr. London's company, Cash Digest, "acting as a
conduit" (London Tr. at 263), immediately loaned the $300,000 to
Alvin Teller who was, at the time, a senior executive at CBS
Records -- the record company to which Mr. Joel was under
contract. London Tr. at 127, 262-268. Mr. London could not
recall obtaining any security or loan documentation to protect
the pension plan or its beneficiaries in connection with this
self-interested loan. London Tr. at 131. Further, Mr. London
never told his admitted fiduciary, Mr. Joel, that these loans
were taken, or that Mr. London, as Trustee, had "washed" Mr.
Joel's pension money through a company owned by Mr. London to an
executive at Mr. Joel's record company. [FN10]

 * In or about May 1986, Mr. London also authorized and approved
the loan of $100,000 from Mr. Joel's pension plan to Sunny
Weather Horses -- an entity owned by Weber and convicted felon,
Irwin Feiner. London Tr. at 1895. No security or loan
documentation was obtained or prepared in connection with this
loan, and Mr. London did not discuss it with Mr. Joel, see,
e.q., London Tr. at 987, even though, as Trustee to the plan,
Mr. London knew he was a fiduciary who had final authority over
those trust funds. London Tr. 228, 330. Mr. Pantzis also
testified that Mr. London knew what his duties were as fiduciary
on the plan. Pantzis Tr. 317.

 Cash Digest

 * Defendant Cash Digest Company, Ltd. ("Cash Digest"), of which
London was an officer and an 80+ owner, operated out of FMI's
offices and rendered bookkeeping services to, among others, FMI,
Mr. Joel and Electric Company.

 * Cash Digest was used as a conduit to secretly funnel Mr.
Joel's funds in order to serve Weber's interests. For example, a
$500,000 loan that Mr. London's company, Cash Digest,
purportedly made to defendant GFR Associates, was actually made
with Mr. Joel's money. See London Tr. at 1378- 1384; Pantzis Tr.
at 212. Mr. Joel's funds were first
transferred to Cash Digest and, thereafter, transferred to GFR
by Cash Digest. No documents were prepared to protect Mr. Joel
with respect to this transfer, and no interest or principal was
ever paid to him by Cash Digest or GFR Associates. In contrast,
a Deed of Trust Note was prepared to protect Cash Digest in
connection with its transfer of the $500,000 (of Mr. Joel's
money) to GFR Associates. Mr. London could not recall ever
discussing this loan with Mr. Joel, see e.q., London Tr. at 987,
and Mr. London could not recall Weber telling him that he had
discussed this transfer with Mr. Joel. London Tr. at 1384.

 * Because no payment of principal or interest was ever made in
respect of this "loan", Joel obtained summary judgment against
GFR shortly after this action was commenced. Mr. Joel was forced
to commence foreclosure proceedings in Virginia in order to
collect on the judgment entered against GFR. Even so, he was
only able to collect less than one-half of the judgment.

 Loco Productions, Inc.

 * Defendant Loco Productions, Inc. ("Loco") is owned 100% by Mr.
London. Loco, like Cash Digest, was operated out of FMI's
offices during the period that Weber acted as Mr. Joel's
manager. See, e.g., London Tr. at 53.

 * Various of Mr. Joel's concert tours were conducted through
Loco, and Mr. Joel's substantial touring revenues were, thus,
channeled through Loco. See, e.q., London Tr. at 1164. Mr.
London himself has admitted that all money that Loco received,
after deducting management commissions and tour related
expenses, belonged to Billy Joel. London Tr. at 1092, 1191.
Similarly, Patricia (Meagher) Murray, who worked at FMI during
the relevant period -- often serving "as a conduit between Frank
[Weber] and Rick [Mr. London]", Murray Tr. at 110 -- confirmed
that the money in the Loco account was "Billy's money." Murray
Tr. at 144; accord Pantzis Tr. at 230. Despite this admission,
Mr. Joel's funds in this 100+ London-owned company were
repeatedly used to fund Weber's and his companies' cash needs.

 * For example, despite Mr. London's admission that all of Loco's
funds, after payment of management commissions and tour
expenses, belonged to Mr. Joel, London Tr. at 1092, 1191, Loco
made interest free transfers of Mr. Joel's money to Weber-
controlled ventures, including Plaza One Associates and Weber's
personal horse company, Silver W Stables. See London Tr. 1184-
1190, 1944, 1950. Although Mr. London claimed to have been
unaware of these defalcations, this self-serving claim is
contradicted by Mr. London's 100+ ownership of Loco, his
admission that he allowed Frank Weber to oversee Loco's
operations, and his admission that he "was aware of what was
going on . . . ." London Tr. at 1092. Further, Mr. Pantzis
testified that Mr. London was aware of the loans, Pantzis Tr. at
247-48, and Weber testified that he discussed with Mr. London
the loans made to partnerships of which Weber was general
partner. Weber Tr. 1457-59. In addition, Patricia (Meagher)
Murray testified to her understanding that Mr. London reviewed
the general ledgers of Loco on a regular basis and that, based
on Mr. London's business acumen, no substantial transfers of
major amounts of money would get past him. Murray Tr. at 145.
Ms. Murray also testified to her understanding that Loco's
$250,000 interest-free "loan" to Plaza One on April 20, 1988
would not have escaped Mr. London's attention, Murray Tr. at
146-147, and that the $250,000 interest-free "loan" from Loco to
Silver W Stables in 1987 could not have been made without Mr.
London's knowledge. Murray Tr. at 149-150, 153.

 Electric Company

 * Electric Company is yet another entity that was operated out
of FMI's offices. Electric Company, like Loco, was a vehicle
through which various of Mr. Joel's concert tours were
conducted. Further, as with Loco, Mr. London admitted that all
of Electric Company's funds, after payment of management
commissions and tour expenses, belonged to Mr. Joel. London Tr.
at 1270-1271. However, notwithstanding this admission, Mr.
London signed an Electric Company check which resulted in
Electric Company lending $450,000 to Jericho Breeding
Associates- I, which was a Weber-controlled horse partnership in
which Mr. London had an equity interest. See London Tr. at 214,
992-997. Mr. London did not recall ever telling Mr. Joel about
this loan, and he did not recall whether anyone else had ever
discussed the loan with Mr. Joel. In fact, Mr. London admitted
that he never discussed any Electric Company loans with Mr.
Joel, and that he never heard Weber or Pantzis discuss any such
loans with Mr. Joel. London Tr. at 1911-1912.

 * Further, despite his numerous other positions of trust, e.q.,
as Weber's right-hand-man, as an officer of Mr. Joel's manager,
FMI, and as an officer and 80+ owner of Cash Digest (Mr. Joel's
bookkeeper) -- not to mention his being Mr. Joel's trusted
friend, brother-in-law and successor trustee of Mr. Joel's will-
- Mr. London never told Mr. Joel about the millions of dollars
of additional loans that Mr. Joel, Electric Company and Mr.
Joel's pension plans made, many of which were either never
repaid or were untimely paid.

 Picturevision/Hicksville

 * Although negotiations in which Mr. London participated
concerning a multi-million dollar video production agreement
with CBS Music Video Entertainment (" CBS") contemplated that
(i) Mr. Joel and CBS would be the only parties to the agreement,
(ii) all payments from CBS would be made directly to Mr. Joel,
and (iii) Mr. Joel would be the copyright owner of the videos,
the contract ultimately executed was, instead, entered into by
defendant Hicksville Productions' predecessor-in-interest
(Picturevision, Inc.), a company in which Mr. London had an
ownership interest. This contract provided for, inter alia, all
of CBS's millions of dollars of payments to be made to
Picturevision (instead of Mr. Joel) and for Picturevision to be
the copyright owner of the videos (instead of Mr. Joel).

 * At Mr. London's urging, and without Mr. Joel's knowledge, Mr.
Joel lent $20,000 to Picturevision at a time when Messrs. Weber
and London, among others, were owners of Picturevision. Mr.
London did not recall discussing this loan with Mr. Joel or
knowing whether anyone ever discussed it with Mr. Joel. London
Tr. at 1583-1584.

 Management Contract

 * Despite knowing that the 1983 Management Agreement between
Weber and Mr. Joel barred Weber from investing Mr. Joel's money
in partnerships from which Weber received fees -- unless such
fees were negotiated in good faith -- Mr. London could not
recall whether anyone ever negotiated such fees with Mr. Joel
prior to Weber investing Mr. Joel's funds in Weber-controlled
ventures. London Tr. at 1308-1312. Even though Mr. London knew
Weber was taking fees in connection with such investments, he
never disclosed this to Mr. Joel. See London Tr. at 1314-1315.

 51. The foregoing is just a sampling of the evidence amassed
against the London Defendants to date and these instances do not
include Mr. London's participation in the 1990 secret diversions
of partnership distributions due to Mr. Joel from Weber-
controlled partnerships.

 London's Participation In the Conversion of Joel's Funds

 * The London defendants received more than $150,000 in
distributions from Frank Management following the illegal
conversions of Mr. Joel's partnership distributions in early
1990 -- Mr. London personally received $100,000 at this time,
and his companies, Loco and Cash Digest, received $27,250 and
$30,000, respectively. Notably, Mr. London has admitted knowing
that, in the same time period that Frank Management made these
payments to the London defendants, Frank Management was
"inactive" and unable to pay its rent. See Ex. J hereto. Mr.
London has also admitted under oath that he believed that the
money paid to him "came from NEA and Capital Downs", with
respect to partnership distributions due to Mr. Joel. London Tr.
1415-18. NCA and Capital Downs were Weber-controlled
partnerships in which Mr. Joel was a partner and from which his
partnership distributions were illegally converted.

 * In February 1993, this Court ruled that the diversions of
partnership distributions due to Joel from NCA and Capitol Downs
were unlawful conversions and awarded summary judgment in Mr.
Joel's favor of more than $675,000. In the more than two years
since this decision, the London defendants have not returned one
dime of these converted funds to Mr. Joel. Significantly, only
after Mr. London's deposition, in the errata sheets to his
deposition transcript, did Mr. London admit that and the
converted funds came from partnership distributions diverted
from Mr. Joel and Elizabeth Weber before he received it from
FMI. See London errata sheets, page 1419, line 15, annexed
hereto as Ex. K.

 * Other witnesses have been more forthcoming in describing Mr.
London's role in the conversion of Mr. Joel's distributions.
Daniel Gecker, Esq., one of the Weber defendants' attorneys,
testified that there were discussions involving Mr. London
regarding the conversions and that Mr. London had prepared a
schedule of "liquidated amounts" for use in connection with
defendants' unlawful diversion of Mr. Joel's funds to Frank
Management. See Gecker Tr. at 468-469 [FN11]; see also Pantzis
Tr. at 656, 661-62. In fact, even though Mr. London admittedly
reviewed this "schedule" after his deposition (see Ex. K
hereto), he has failed to produce it in spite of the plaintiffs'
express demand and this Court's January 20, 1995 Order.

 * Frank Weber also testified that Mr. London prepared a schedule
that was used in connection with determining what amount of sums
of Mr. Joel's money to convert. Weber Tr. at 1216-21. Moreover,
Mr. Weber testified that Mr. London knew (i) that at the time
these payments were made FMI could not even afford to pay its
office rent, (ii) the true source of the funds paid to the
London defendants, and (iii) that Mr. Joel was not told about
the diversions. Id. at 1232-36, 1746-52.

 Discontinuance Against The London Defendants Is Warranted

 52. While the foregoing facts demonstrate that plaintiffs'
claims against the London defendants are strong and meritorious,
plaintiffs have been advised, and have ascertained through Mr.
London's deposition testimony, that the London defendants have
virtually no assets to satisfy any judgments that might be
entered against them. Mr. London testified in his deposition
that both defendants Cash Digest and Loco have been inactive for
years and have no money. London Tr. at 99. Further, Mr. London
testified that he has been unemployed since September 1989, and
has been living with his father in California. Additionally, the
London defendants' attorney, John P. Bracken, Esq., stated to
this Court in an affidavit, sworn to October 21, 1994 (f2), not
only that Mr. London had been unemployed for years and was
living with his parents, but also that "Mr. London is of very
limited resources."

 53. Plainly, continuing the litigation of plaintiffs' claims and
a lengthy trial, in these circumstances, which would result in,
inter alia, additional legal expenses for plaintiffs without
being able to recover funds, and additional demands upon the
limited resources of this Court, makes no sense. This is
particularly so when (i) the London defendants are seeking to
bring thirteen of the settling Weber defendants back into this
litigation to respond to the London defendants' cross-claims,
and (ii) the London defendants, in breach of this Court's
January 20, 1995 Order, have refused to respond to
Interrogatories and to produce documents.

 54. As shown in the accompanying memorandum of law, plaintiffs'
motion to discontinue should be granted, for it is well-settled
that an application for a discontinuance should be granted
where, as here, it will not cause prejudice. [FN12] None of the
circumstances in which such prejudice has been found to exist is
present here. Thus, there is no outstanding court order in favor
of the London defendants which would be frustrated by the
discontinuance, the London defendants have not even a single
pending counterclaim against plaintiffs (let alone one that
would be adversely affected by a discontinuance), and this
matter has not proceeded to trial on the merits.

 55. Clearly, the interests of justice are best served by a
discontinuance here. This Court's resources are best used in
connection with the continued prosecution of cases that have
been brought by plaintiffs who wish to pursue their claims to
obtain financial recovery. It would be pointless for the Court
to continue to devote its limited time and energy to the
litigation which plaintiffs seek to end, and in which the three
remaining defendants have no meaningful assets. Through
settlements plaintiffs have achieved to date, the number of
defendants in the Weber and Grubman actions have been reduced
from thirty-seven defendants to just the remaining three
London defendants, none of whom has the resources to satisfy a
judgment sufficient to warrant either the plaintiffs incurring
continued legal expenses or this Court's further commitment of
judicial resources.

 CONCLUSION

 56. For the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs respectfully request
that an order, pursuant to CPLR 3217(b), be entered discontinuing
this action without prejudice against the three London
defendants and granting such order and further relief as the
Court deems proper, including striking ~the London defendan~ts'
answer and entering default judgment against them pursuant to
CPLR 3216(3)

 END NOTES

 1 The Weber defendants include Weber, FMI, Lucille Weber,
Hicksville Productions, Inc., Thoroughbred Breeding Associates-
I, Thoroughbred Breeding Associates-II, Lincoln Road Associates,
International Management Communications, Inc., GFR Associates,
Rosemary Haliasz, Edward Haliasz, Richard Siegel, Lincoln Road
Realty Corp., George Ross, Anthony T. Conforti, The River
Company, James Pantzis, Frank Management, Inc. Defined Benefits
Pension Plan, Storm Front Leasing & Investment Co. and Mid-
Island Bloodstock Management, Inc.

 2 In fact, far from agreeing to stipulate to end this
litigation, the London defendants have recently sought to expand
it and to bring back into the litigation many of the Weber
defendants. On or about February 6, 1995, the London defendants
served Verified Cross-Claims which assert three separate cross-
claims against thirteen of the Weber defendants, including Weber
and FMI.

 3 Bankruptcy Court approval of any settlement of plaintiffs'
claims against Weber (and prior notice to the Trustee before
settling FMI's counterclaim) was required by the December 1990
Bankruptcy Court Order that granted plaintiffs' relief from the
automatic stay to continue prosecuting their claims against
Weber in this lawsuit.

 4 In contrast to Mr. London's obstructive conduct, Mr. Joel
disrupted and altered his international concert tour to schedule
twenty-eight days of depositions.

 5 Plaintiffs expressly reserved their right to depose Mr. London
with respect to documents produced and his written responses to
Plaintiffs' Notice of Discovery and Inspection and Plaintiffs'
Interrogatories to Defendants dated October 13, 1994. Because
Mr. London has yet to provide any of this court-ordered
discovery, the need to resume his deposition cannot yet be
determined.

 12 In addition, Mr. London has threatened that he may seek to
bring a malicious prosecution claim following the discontinuance
of this lawsuit. Such a claim would be utterly baseless and
subject to dismissal at the pleading stage. However, plaintiffs
request that this discontinuance, which is not on the merits, be
issued "without prejudice" to plaintiffs' ability to assert
these claims in defense of, and as counterclaims, if, and only
if, Mr. London actually seeks to bring such a claim.

IAS Part 19
(Hon. Edward H. Lehner)

REPLY AFFIDAVIT OF
LEONARD M. MARKS IN
SUPPORT OF MOTION TO
DISCONTINUE ACTION

LEONARD M. MARKS, being duly sworn, deposes and says:

 1. I am a member of the firm of Gold, Farrell & Marks, attorneys
for plaintiffs in this action. I submit this affidavit in
support of plaintiffs' motion pursuant to CPLR 3217(b) for an
order discontinuing without prejudice the above-captioned action
against the sole remaining defendants, Mr. Richard London, Loco
Productions, Inc. and The Cash Digest Company, Ltd. (the "London
Defendants").

  2. Through this motion, plaintiffs seek to end this once
massive lawsuit by discontinuing their claims against the London
Defendants, who, in their minimal answering paper, clearly admit
that they do not have sufficient resources to satisfy a judgment
that could be entered against them. Moreover, none of the London
Defendants has even a single pending claim of any kind against
plaintiffs. There is no reason for the Court to devote further
resources to motions, a potential two month trial or any other
aspect of this case.

  PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

  3. Nothing in the highly personal, extremely vicious and
utterly baseless affirmation submitted by the London Defendants'
attorney in opposition to plaintiffs' motion provides any ground
for denying the requested relief. In fact, apart from a stream
of self-serving generalities and inflammatory rhetoric, their
opposition is extraordinarily flimsy. Defendants have failed to
cite even a single case that would support denial of plaintiffs'
motion, and they provide no detailed opposition whatever to the
extensive factual testimony cited specifically in the moving
papers that overwhelmingly supports plaintiffs' claims against
them. Likewise, they have failed entirely to distinguish any the
authorities cited in plaintiffs' memorandum of law which
establish that plaintiffs should be permitted to discontinue
this lawsuit on a without prejudice basis.

  4. Further, notwithstanding the sound and fury of the London
Defendants' opposition, they have not identified any prejudice
that they would suffer from the discontinuance that plaintiffs
seek. In fact, the London Defendants have no objection at all to
the discontinuance of this litigation -- which is not in itself
surprising because they have no pending claims against
plaintiffs -- but they nevertheless seek to obtain something to
which they are not entitled, i.e., a discontinuance with
prejudice. However, the London Defendants cite no authority to
support such a ruling, and they admit in their opposition papers
that, as recently as September 1994, a without ~prejudice
discontinuance was completely acceptable to them. ~In light of
this admission, it is clear that a discontinuance on a without
prejudice basis would not impact unfairly on defendants and is
appropriate under CPLR 3217(b) See, e.g., Valladares v.
Valladares, 80 A.D.2d 244, 438 N.Y.S.2c 810, 819 (2d Dep't 1981
("general rule is that plaintiff should be permitted to
discontinue the action without prejudice, unless defendant wou~ld
be prejudiced thereby"), aff'd, 55 N.Y.2d 378, 434 N.Y.S.E.2d
1050, 449 N.Y.S.2d 683 (1982); Arsenault v. Arsenault, 192 A.D.
2d 596 N.Y.S.2d 628 (4th Dep't 1993) (same)

  5. Although the London Defendants suggest that they will
forever be cowering in fear that Mr. Joel may reassert his
claims against them at some point in the future if the
discontinuance is without prejudice, this is not at all the
case. Plaintiffs hereby commit, consistent with my opening
affidavit (54 r..12. that the only circumstance in which
plaintiffs would seek to reassert their claims against the
London Defendants is if the London Defendants bring a new action
asserting claims against plaintiffs that concern or relate to
the claims that plaintiffs now seek to discontinue.

  6. Given the London Defendants' recent admission that Mr.
London is of "very limited resources", and given the
considerable time, expense and effort that would be required to
complete discovery and an estimated two month trial, the
lawsuit should be discontinued now. Additionally, as addressed
in more detail below, such a discontinuance should not include
an award of costs. The London Defendants' unsupported request
for such an award (including attorneys' fees) for the period
since Septemb~er 1994 is wholly without merit. Moreover, in
light of the London Defendants' repeated failure to comply with
plaintiffs' discove~ry notices, which required plaintiffs both
to make repeated motions to compel them to appear for
depositions and to oppose the London Defendants' unsuccessful
protective order requests, any par~ty should be awarded costs, it
is plaintiffs.

  THE LONDON DEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION CONFIRMS THAT PLAINTIFFS'
MOTION SHOULD BE GRANTED WITHOUT AN AWARD OF COSTS

  7. The London Defendants' opposition to plaintiffs' motion,
while not opposing discontinuance of the lawsuit, raise- several
points for which response is warranted. Thus, they suggest
without any evidence or support that plaintiffs' claims against
Mr. London lack merit, (ii) once again misrepresent the true
nature of plaintiffs' settlement with the Weber Defendants, and
(iii) seek an award of costs that they claim to have incurre~d
since September, when they wanted to sign a stipulation
discontinuing the claims asserted agains~t them on a without
prejudice basis. Plaintiffs show below that none of these
"points" has merit.

  Plaintiffs Claims against the London Defendants

  8. Nothing in Mr. London attorneys' affirmation presents any
meritorious defense to the detailed claims plaintiffs have
asserted against Mr. London or either of the two virtually
bankrupt companies he controls, defendants Loco Production and
Cash Digest. Moreover, the opposing affirmation misrepresents
that all of Mr. Joel's claims against Mr. London are based upon
his conduct "in his employee capacity for [Mr. Joel's manager]."
Diviney Aff. 10. This statement is flatly contradicted by the
Complaint (see, e.g., Complaint 155, 164, 225).

  9. Further, as set forth in my opening affidavit -- and
completely unrebutted in the London Defendants' opposition to
this motion -- Mr. London was far more than just an employee of
Frank Management, Inc. He was also, among other things, (i) a
director, officer and shareholder of defendant International
Management Communications, Inc. -- a company against which Mr.
Joel was awarded a judgment in this lawsuit in 1990, (ii) an
officer, director and/or owner of defendant Hicksville
Productions, Inc. and its predecessor company, Picturevision,
Inc. -- a company to which Mr. London caused Mr. Joel to
unknowingly loan funds, (iii) the 80% majority owner of
defendant Cash Digest which, inter alia, served repeatedly as a
conduit for funds that were loaned -- without Mr. Joel's
knowledge -- by Mr. Joel and his pension plan in order to
benefit Weber and his new entities, and (iv) the 100% owner of
Loco Productions, Inc., which was another company that also
made (without Mr. Joel's knowledge) repeated, undisclosed loans
of monies that Mr. Londin himself admitted belonged to Mr.
Joel.

  10. Moreover, defendants' only specific challenge ~to claims
against Mr. London -- arising from Mr. London's misconduct as
trustee of Mr. Joel's pension plan and as a director, officer a
nd shareholder of IMC (Diviney Aff. 11) -- is also without mer~it
Mr. London admitted in his deposition that, as Trustee of Mr.
Joel's pension plan, he caused the plan to make loans to Frank
Weber personally and to various Weber-controlled companies.
Additionally, documents produced by defendants themselves and
the deposition testimony of FMI's controller establish that
amounts owed on these loans were not repaid when due and that
Mr. London allowed these loans even though he knew that other
loans that were taken from plaintiffs for Weber's horse
partnerships were in default. For Mr. London to pretend that his
knowing and substantial participation in these pension fund
loans is not relevant to plaintiffs' claims that he aided and
abetted Weber and FMI's breaches of fiduciary duty and frauds
upon Mr. Joel and Electric Company is baseless.

  11. Similarly, the London Defendants' suggestion that Mr.
London cannot be held personally accountable to Mr. Joel for his
misconduct with respect to IMC -- because such conduct could
only be redressed through a shareholder ~derivative lawsuit
(Diviney Aff. 10) -- is nonsense. Mr. London's actions in
connection with, inter alia, the repeated loans that IMC
obtained from Mr. Joel and IMC's payment in 1988 of nearly
$200,000 to FMI, without paying a penny to Mr. Joel, who was
owed over $100,000 in overdue loans and interest, damaged Mr.
Joel personally. Mr. London's claim, unsupported by any legal
authority, that this conduct can only be challenged in a
shareholder derivative lawsuit is simply wrong.

  Mr. London's Repeated Mischaracterization of Mr. Joel's Victory
Against the Weber Defendants

  12. The London Defendants' opposition paper repeat their prior
mischaracterization of Mr. Joel's successful resolution of his
claims against the Weber Defendants. Although the London
Defendants' portray the resolution of these claims as netting
half a million dollars to Weber (Diviney Aff. 10), this is
absolutely incorrect. Indisputable facts, which the London
Defendants ignore, establish that Mr. Joel won judgments against
the Weber Defendants of nearly $3,00,000 during the course of
the litigation, collected nearly $1,000,000 from them, and, at
the time of the Weber settlement, had no expectation of
recovering any further sums from Weber and his controlled
entities because of Weber's bankruptcy filing showing
liabilities of $23,000,000.

  13. For the London Defendants to contend tha~~~t the Webe~r
settlement "indisputably shows weakness of Mr. Joel's claims",
defies reality and ignores the facts that (a) Mr. Joel
completely extinguished Weber's $15,000,000 management
commission counterclaim, (b) Mr.Joel successfully won the entry
of judg~ments of nearly $3,000,000 against the Weber Defendants,
and recovered approximately $1,000,000 from the Weber
Defendants; (c) Mr. Joe~l had a net recovery of approximately
$50,000 from the Weber Defendants (even after the "half a
million" payment that the London Defendants myopically harp
about), and (d) Mr. Joel's payment was made to the Bankruptcy
Trustee and avoided any bankruptcy litigation by the Trustee or
Weber's 300 creditors. Further, when the settlement plaintiffs
obtained in the related Grubman action and the amounts that
plaintiffs recovered pursua~nt to settlement agreements with
other defendants in Mr. Joel's litigations are added to the
$3,000,000 in judgments that Joel obtained against the Weber
Defendants, the notion that Mr. Joel's claims were not
successfully resolved is frivolous. In fact, Mr. Joel's
recoveries in the litigations total approximately $8,000,000.

  14. Finally, as noted in my moving affidavit, the London,
Defendants' continued misrepresentation of the true facts
concerning the Weber Settlement, coupled with other false public
attacks made by the Weber Defendants and by Allen Grubman, Esq.
about their settlements is another strong factor supporting the
motion to end all remaining litigation. [FN1]

  Mr. London is Not Entitled to Any Costs

  15. Mr. London's opposition papers do not demonstrate his
entitlement to an award of costs. Moreover, Mr. London's
suggestion that such an award should be made for the period from
September 1994 to the present -- because he was willing to
discontinue the lawsuit on a without prejudice basis in
September -- is unfounded. While Mr. London did agree to have
the lawsuit discontinued on a without prejudice basis then --
which raises a serious question about why he opposes it now --
his description of the facts are incomplete.

  16. The proposed without prejudice stipulation of
discontinuance that plaintiffs prepared in September
specifically provided that the London Defendants "do not have
substantial financial resources for which a judgment against
them could be satisfied". See Diviney Arf. Ex. A (third to last
page). The London Defendants refused to sign this stipulation,
which plain~. suggested that they may have had financial
resources about which plaintiffs were unaware. Their adamant
refusal to sign a stipulation with such a clause triggered the
continuation of Mr. ~London's deposition.

  17. About one month after the lact day thac Mr. London
appeared for his deposition, new light was shed on his financial
condition. In an affidavit that the London Defendants submitted
as part of their unsuccessful effort to block the entry of an
order discontinuing the action against the Weber Defendants, Mr.
London's attorney stated that: "Mr. London is of very limited
resources. He has been unemployed since the action started and
he has been forced to move back with his family to his parents
in California." See Affidavit of John P. Bracken, Esq. sworn to
October 21, 1994, 2.

  18. Notably, since the last day of the London deposition, the
London Defendants have incurred virtually no costs of which
plaintiffs are aware for which they could contend that any award
of costs would be appropriate. With few exceptions, the London
Defendants' attorneys have not attended any of the third party
depositions held subsequent to September. Similarly, their
participation in motion practice since October has been
extremely limited. Even more, to the extent that they have
participated, they have uniformly been unsuccessful. The results
of the four motions that have been brought since September are:

  (1) Weber Defendants' motion to discontinue the claims asserted
against them: Over the London Defendants' unsuccessful
opposition, the Court granted this motion.

  (2) London Defendants' cross-motion for a protective order
against plaintiffs' Interrogatories and Document Request: The
London Defendants' motion against plaintiff - October 1994
discovery notices was denied in January 1995. Defendants still
have not answered any Interrogatories or produced any
documents.

  (3) Plaintiffs' cross-motion to extend discovery and depose to
out-of-state witnesses: Notwithstanding the London Defendants'
opposition, the Court granted plaintiffs' motion.

  (4) Plaintiffs' motion to compel Frank Weber's deposition: The
London Defendants did not contest this motion, which was
granted.

  19. Finally, Mr. London's request for an award for costs
particularly inappropriate given his past conduct in this case.
Not only has he repeatedly failed to appear for his deposition
(as described in my moving affidavit, see 37 et seq.), which has
required plaintiffs to make multiple motions to compel the
deposition, but also he forced plaintiffs to incur costs
needlessly by frivolously asserting a defamation counterclaim
against plaintiffs which was promptly dismissed by the Court on
the pleading. In short, there is no basis for awarding costs to
the London Defendants. [FN2]

  CONCLUSION

  For the foregoing reasons, and the reasons set forth in my
moving affidavit and plaintiffs' moving memorandum of law,
plaintiffs respectfully request that an order be entered
discontinuing this action without prejudice and without costs
against the London Defendants and granting such other and
further relief as the Court deems proper.

  END NOTES

  1 In this connection, Mr. London's complaint about the media
and his claim that plaintiffs have irretrievably ruined; his
reputation" is unfounded. Mr. London himself, the Weber
Defendants and the Grubman Defendants have each invoked the
press in order to suit their purposes. Further, the London
Defendants have not cited or attached even a single article that
reflects any "smearing" of Mr. London's reputation.

  2 The London defendants also purport to seek an award of costs
to compensate third-party witnesses who appeared for
depositions. Defendants have cited no authority for this
extraordinary proposition, and plaintiffs are unaware of any
Moreover, such third-party witnesses received the statutory
witness fees and transportation payment required in connection
with their depositions under CPLR 8001.

of this Agreement to the date of initiation or continuation of
prosecution, as provided for in the terms expressed herein,
shall be deemed to be a necessary delay at my request, and I
waive any defense to such prosecution on the ground that such
delay operated to deny my rights under Rule 48(b) of the Federal

<P>This is the ruling by a surrogate court ordering the removal of two co-executors of Doris Duke's $1.2 billion estate. The court found that Duke's former butler Bernard Lafferty was squandering her estate to support his "profligate life style" and that United States Trust Company failed to slow down Lafferty's spending.</P>

SURROGATE'S COURT : NEW YORK COUNTY

-----------------------------X
Probate Proceeding,
Will of DORIS DUKE,                File No. 4440/93
Deceased.
-----------------------------X

PREMINGER, S.

 Doris Duke ("Duke") died in October of 1993 leaving an estate
of over one billion dollars. During her last decade, there were
several changes in her family relationships, confidants and
estate plan. She never wavered, however, in her desire to use
her vast fortune to benefit the public upon her death.

 For at least the last six months of Duke's life control of her
affairs was held by her former butler, then personal assistant
and constant companion, Bernard Lafferty ("Lafferty"). In March
of 1993 Duke lay ill and heavily medicated in a Los Angeles
hospital. Lafferty was instrumental in effecting various changes
in Duke's financial arrangements and estate plan. He brought a
new team of lawyers, recommended by her plastic surgeon, Dr.
Harry Glassman, to her hospital bed. Four days after her initial
meeting with the lawyers, Duke's signature was obtained on a
variety of documents.

 First was a March 8, 1993 codicil to her November 4, 1991 will.
The only substantial changes in the codicil were for Lafferty's
benefit: his annuity was increased by several hundred thousand
dollars annually; his executor's commission was raised from
$250,000 to $5,000,000; he was given authority to designate (and
remove at any time) a corporate co-executor; and a $250,000
ceiling on his aggregate trustee's commissions was deleted,
giving him the potential for more than $1,000,000 in trustee's
commissions every year. Duke also executed powers of attorney in
favor of Lafferty, giving him complete control of her finances.

 The generous provisions for Lafferty in the March 8 codicil (and
another codicil dated March 14, 1993) were retained in an April
5, 1993 will -- the instrument offered for probate. Duke died on
October 28, 1993. Lafferty and the bank designated by him, U.S.
Trust Company of New York ("U.S. Trust"), were appointed
preliminary executors on November 1, 1993.

 Objections to the propounded instrument were filed by Duke's
adopted daughter, Chandi Heffner, who has entered into a
tentative settlement agreement which awaits court approval. The
executors under two prior instruments conducted depositions of
the attesting witnesses and draftsmen in the hope of persuading
the Court to grant them leave to file objections. In the course
of those examinations and litigation over discovery, a number of
serious and startling allegations were raised concerning the
conduct of the preliminary executors before and after Duke's
death.

 On January 20, 1995, the Court appointed Richard H. Kuh, Esq. as
limited temporary administrator (SCPA 702 [8],[9] and [10]) to
examine the allegations of misconduct of the preliminary co
-executors, examine the affairs of the estate, conduct interviews
to the extent deemed necessary, and report to the Court as to
the need, if any, for further action. The Court directed that
Mr. Kuh be accorded unrestricted access to all documents, books
and records relating to the estate and requested the parties and
their counsel to cooperate with him to the fullest extent.

 Mr. Kuh has now filed and served his thorough and extensive
report (the "Report") and the preliminary executors have filed
cartons of documents in response. The Report addresses the
propriety of the actions of both Lafferty and U.S. Trust. At
issue is whether their actions warrant removing them as
preliminary co-executors (SCPA 707, 711, 719).

 The disclosures in the Report can be divided into two
categories. First are the disclosures that rely upon factual
allegations that are disputed by the preliminary executors, but
which, if proved, could constitute grounds for removal. These
include: possible dishonesty on the part of Lafferty, U.S. Trust
and/or their counsel; transfers of Duke's funds shortly before
her death that may not have been made with her knowledge or
consent [FN1]; evidence that Duke's medical condition made it
unlikely that she had the capacity to execute the propounded
will; undisputed evidence that Dr. Glassman removed (and later
replaced) Duke's hospital records; evidence concerning
circumstances surrounding Duke's death that could support an
inference that her death was hastened; and the possible misuse
of funds by the preliminary executors for unnecessary expenses.
These disputed issues will inevitably be explored in depth in
subsequent proceedings, and need not be evaluated here.

 Of more immediate concern is the second category of disclosures
in the Report, based upon facts which are essentially
undisputed.

 Lafferty

 As to Lafferty, these undisputed facts invoke several of the
classic grounds for removal of a fiduciary: (1) commingling of
estate and personal assets; (2) waste of estate assets; (3)
improvidence and want of understanding; and (4) substance abuse.

 1. Commingling of Estate and Personal Assets (EPTL 11-1.6; SCPA
719[7]; Self-Dealing

 Using his authority as preliminary executor Lafferty has
expended and continues to expend estate funds to establish a
profligate lifestyle. He uses Duke's residences as his homes,
living in her California and New Jersey bedroom suites. He
authorized renovations to his California living quarters, at
estate expense, including enlarging the area of glass bedroom
doors facing on a private garden, making improvements to the
garden statuary, and installing in the private bath a spa
bathtub and marble flooring. He admits that the expenditures
inured to his personal benefit and comfort.

 Lafferty lives largely at estate expense. He receives meals
prepared by estate staff. His medical and dental services are
paid for by the estate. He is accompanied by personal security
guards. He is transported at estate expense, in a chauffeured
Cadillac and in the Duke private Boeing 737 before its sale. He
now flies first class on commercial planes, attended by one or
more bodyguard/companions also flying first class.

 Lafferty had access to Duke's credit cards during her lifetime.
He has continued to use the estate's corporate credit cards for
his own personal expenditures. He so thoroughly commingles the
use of personal and estate funds that estate personnel and
outside accountants regularly attempt to reconcile the billings.

 Though the propounded instrument makes generous provision for
Lafferty (through an annuity and fiduciary commissions), it does
not provide him with a residence or authorize continuation of
his lifestyle. This is in contrast to the fact that the will
directs that a residence be provided for three other named
employees.

 2. Waste of Estate Assets (SCPA 711[2]; 719[10]); Self-Dealing

 Lafferty does not have a valid driver's license, yet he was
driving Duke's Cadillac after her death and demolished it in an
accident. The car was replaced at estate expense (partially from
recoupment of insurance proceeds) with a new Cadillac for
Lafferty's personal (chauffeured) use. The justification offered
by the preliminary co-executors for this expenditure is that
Lafferty, designated under the will to be a trustee of major
charitable foundations, will need to travel "in style" when in
California in connection with foundation matters.

 Lafferty continues to draw the $100,000 annual salary [FN2] he
had received as "executive assistant" to Duke, despite her
demise. This salary is in addition to the annuity provided for
Lafferty under the will. It is also in addition to fiduciary
commissions to which he may be entitled, although the will fixes
a maximum commission for his services as executor. The
preliminary co-executors seek to justify this salary with the
claim that Lafferty is performing extraordinary services beyond
those traditionally required of a fiduciary. Yet, while the
preliminary co-executors recognize the questionable and self-
dealing nature of the payments, no application has been made to
this Court for a determination of their propriety (SCPA
2107[2]).

 3. Improvidence and Want of Understanding (SCPA 711[2],[8];
719[10])

 While issues of alleged fiduciary impropriety can sometimes be
deferred to an accounting and remedied through surcharge, it is
unclear that Lafferty could ever answer for losses to this
estate. Lafferty admits that, but for his expectancies from the
estate, he is insolvent. Not only does he have no personal
assets, but since Duke's death he has undertaken massive debt.
His checking account at U.S. Trust has, at times, been
overdrawn. He had unpaid credit card bills in excess of $89,000
and has borrowed $825,000 from U.S. Trust (as discussed below).
The monies have been expended on luxury purchases such as
jewelry and antiques.

 Lafferty's personal financial situation evidences not only a
lack of appreciation of the most basic financial matters, but a
cavalier attitude towards money in general. The Report indicates
numerous instances where Lafferty's responses to financial
queries were inaccurate by orders of magnitude. He estimated the
value of antiques that he had purchased in 1994 at $60,000 -
$70,000, whereas the actual value is approximately $650,000. He
responded to an inquiry about the legal fees of the estate's
primary counsel with an estimate of $30 million, without
comprehending the significance of that sum or the fact that
legal fees paid or payable to that firm as reported on the
Federal estate tax return (that he signed) are approximately $13
million. It is admitted that Lafferty is limited in his
abilities and basically illiterate. An examination of the
exhibits displaying his occasional attempts to communicate in
writing clearly demonstrate his disability.

 4. Substance Abuse (SCPA 711[2],[8]; 719[10])

 Lafferty is an admitted alcoholic and has gone on documented
binges subsequent to his appointment as preliminary co-executor,
including at least one instance where he became combative and
violent and had to have restraints applied. He is also dependent
on substantial doses of a number of anti- depressant and anti
-psychotic medications for mood disorders, sleep disorders and
transient thinking (delusional) disorder [FN3]. Counsel for the
estate and/or personnel of U.S. Trust have been called upon to
rescue Lafferty and assist him in obtaining emergency medical
attention. They have transported him to hospitals (admitting him
under an assumed name) and back to the Duke residences, by Duke
plane and otherwise. The expenses related to such incidents have
been borne by the estate.

 U.S. Trust

 The Report's findings with respect to U.S. Trust are equally
troubling. There can be no question that a fiduciary is
accountable for his acquiescence in the misconduct of his co-
fiduciary (Matter of Rothko, 43 NY2d 305; Matter of Horowitz,
297 NY 252; Matter of Durston, 297 NY 64; Matter of Marks, 137
AD2d 756, appeal denied, 71 NY2d 807; Matter of Rubin, 147 Misc
2d 981). If ever there was a need for a corporate fiduciary to
rein in the excesses of an unsophisticated and unknowledgeable
individual co-fiduciary, it exists in this estate. U.S. Trust
has failed to discharge this duty to the estate and the
charitable beneficiaries.

 U.S. Trust enjoys a reputation as one of the foremost banking
and trust institutions, specializing in the administration of
large and complex estates and trusts. Although it is premature
to assess U.S. Trust's performance prior to the submission of a
formal accounting, the responsive papers seek to demonstrate
that the bank has utilized its sophisticated talents in the
administration of the estate. Teams of its specialists managed
decedent's palatial residential properties in five states,
supervised business assets, appraised and safeguarded extensive
collections of art, antiques, jewelry and other valuable
tangible personal property, and made investment decisions with
respect to financial portfolios [FN4].

 Notwithstanding U.S. Trust's recognized technical expertise, the
Report documents numerous instances where bank officers at the
highest levels sought to appease their powerful co-fiduciary
rather than exercise independent professional judgment. Lafferty
and U.S. Trust were aware that under the propounded instrument
Lafferty has sole authority to appoint the corporate co
-executor, determine its compensation, and remove it at any time.
Indeed, in an affidavit prepared for his signature, Lafferty
admits that at times he made threats to fire U.S. Trust, but
avers that he never intended to act upon them.

 According to U.S. Trust, upon its appointment as preliminary co
-executor it "immediately determined it was necessary to deal
with Mr. Lafferty's need for funds." The bank's president
suggested that a loan be offered to Lafferty to provide him with
"sufficient cash flow beyond his annual salary." No satisfactory
explanation is offered for Lafferty's "need" for a large cash
infusion, particularly in light of the bank's questionable
decision to continue his salary and provide living expenses
through estate funds.

 A November 22, 1993 internal U.S. Trust memorandum indicates
that at least some lower-level bank employees recognized the
improprieties involved in a loan to Lafferty:

 At 2:30 this afternoon, Tony Marshall [a Senior Vice President
and Manager of the U.S. Trust Estate Planning Department] called
me [the loan officer assigned to the matter] to ask if we would
provide Bernard Lafferty with a loan of approximately $300,000,
plus interest to accrue until repayment. Tony needs an answer by
8:30 AM when he has a conference call with Lafferty's Chicago
lawyers. Lafferty may also be amenable to pay interest monthly,
but in that case, would ask for a higher loan, to cover the
interest payments. The interest rate itself was not discussed.

 The purpose of the loan, which would be structured as a non
-revolving line of credit, which would pay Lafferty $30,000 per
month over a 10 month period, would be for living expenses.

 Lafferty earned a salary as a butler, of $100,000 p.a. He used
Miss Duke's credit card to pay for her expenses as well as his
own. Now that she is dead he no longer can use her card. Tony is
trying to figure out how much Lafferty charged on the card for
his own personal expenses.

 Lafferty is both co-executor of the Estate, with U.S.Trust (and
has the right to fire us) and will inherit $500,000 p.a. for the
remainder of his life once the estate is settled.

 The only way out of this loan would be from the payment of
executor commissions. Tony explained that he files a IRS 706
Estate Tax forms, 9 months after death. After that, (in
August/Sept 1994), the executor will apply to the Surrogate
Court for payment on the account of the executor commission.
[FN5] At that time, Lafferty is expected to be given $1,000,000,
which would be payable by the end of 1994. In total, Lafferty is
entitled to $5,000,000. Tony said that even if probate is
denied, Lafferty should get his $1MM commission. Tony gives this
a 99% probability. [FN6]

 Lafferty has no assets in his own right. Tony said that the
estate can not lend him the money. He did not give me the
reason.

 I explained our conference call and that you felt that lending
on an unsecured basis to a co-executor, with no financials of
his own, with terms which would be much more favorable than to a
regular client, appeared to be a conflict of interest. Tony
disagreed, saying that we would be lending on the basis of
expected income, and we could structure the loan so that
Lafferty would pay interest monthly if we lent him the interest
amount.

 Tony indicated that the loan was Jeff Maurer's [President of
U.S. Trust] idea and that Dick Covey [outside counsel to U.S.
Trust] had ok'ed it, as no conflict of interest existed. Tony
indicated that he has to inform the Chicago lawyers in a
conference call at 8:30 AM Tuesday Nov. 23 if we will do this
loan for Lafferty. We have no financial statement from Lafferty,
no 100% first way out, no second way out, no hypothecation of
the estate's assets (which I requested).

 By the next day U.S. Trust had abandoned its concerns as to
conflict of interest and repayment. Lafferty received a $300,000
unsecured line of credit. He quickly depleted these funds, and
further lines of credit to cover his personal expenses were
provided during the next 13 months for a total of $825,000 (an
additional $200,000 on April 11, 1994; $200,000 on September 16,
1994, $30,000 on October 31, 1994; and $95,000 on January 4,
1995). Even after such enormous borrowings, Lafferty was
permitted to continue to draw a salary and live at estate
expense.

 At the time of each loan, the bank was fully cognizant of the
fact that Lafferty had no assets of his own and that repayment
was possible only from his expectancies from the estate, either
in terms of his legacies under the propounded will or from
fiduciary commissions. A fiduciary may not take a position where
his personal interest might be in conflict with his duty; where
a proposed action involves even a technical conflict of
interest, the fiduciary must not proceed without prior authority
from the Court (Matter of Tannenbaum, 30 Misc 2d 743, mod 20
AD2d 808, affd 15 NY2d 829). Nonetheless, court approval
(pursuant to SCPA 2107[2]) for U.S. Trust's loans to Lafferty
was not sought.

 U.S. Trust now seeks to assure the Court that in the future it
will place its fiduciary obligations ahead of its self- interest
in assuring repayment. It denies the existence of any
possibility of loss to the estate, since the loans were not made
from estate assets and only the bank bears the risk of
nonpayment. This ignores the essence of the conflict: U.S.
Trust, which has an affirmative duty to supervise its co-
fiduciary and report on any wrongdoing, has voluntarily placed
itself in the position of suffering a substantial financial loss
if Lafferty does not continue as fiduciary. It is not without
relevance that the large loans were continued after serious
questions about Lafferty's capacity to serve had been raised in
court.

 The potential for harm to the estate is not merely theoretical.
The estate has already borne, without challenge by the
professional corporate fiduciary, the substantial expense of
Lafferty's living arrangements, the continuation of his
questionable salary, the expenses of needless renovations [FN7],
the replacement of a luxury car destroyed through his
recklessness, the expense of reconciling commingled accounts,
and the expense and embarrassment of his public alcoholic
binges. No discovery proceedings have been brought to determine
the validity of the deathbed transfers to Lafferty or others.

 U.S. Trust owes a duty of undivided and undiluted loyalty to the
beneficiaries of this estate (Birnbaum v Birnbaum, 73 NY2d 461;
Matter of Rothko, supra; Wendt v Fischer, 243 NY 439). This is
an inflexible rule of fidelity which requires that U.S. Trust
avoid any situation where its own interests possibly conflict
with the interests of those owed a fiduciary duty (Birnbaum v
Birnbaum, supra at 466; Matter of Durston, supra; Matter of
Ryan, 291 NY 376). The foregoing facts compel the conclusion
that U.S. Trust has violated its fiduciary obligations by its
self- interested concern for continuing as preliminary executor
and attempting to ensure repayment of its loans.

 In addition, U.S. Trust is responsible for its own acts of
waste. The bank permitted the estate to retain the services of
non-resident alien employees, who are paid in cash. No Social
Security or unemployment taxes have been paid on their salaries,
in violation of Federal law. U.S. Trust concedes that these
violations will subject the estate to interest and penalties.

 The tenor of the preliminary executors' response to the Report
is not reassuring. Answering criticism of "off the books" cash
payments to illegal alien employees, U.S. Trust contends that it
was merely continuing Duke's unlawful practice. Answering
allegations of ethical lapses and waste of estate assets, U.S.
Trust argues that administration of the estate is nearly
complete and removal of the fiduciaries at this late date will
cause substantial harm [FN8]. Answering charges that he is unfit
to serve as trustee of the charitable trusts to be funded from
this billion dollar estate, Lafferty declares that he will not
exercise the control he has been given under the propounded
will. Instead, he states that he will assign his "broad powers"
to a star-studded (and presumably busy) panel of celebrities.
These responses evidence a failure to appreciate the proper role
of a fiduciary.

 It should not need repeating that the hallmark of a fiduciary is
not technical expertise, specialized knowledge or professional
reputation. It is integrity and attention to ethical
considerations that sets a fiduciary apart. "Not honesty alone,
but the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive, is then the
standard of behavior" (Meinhard v Salmon, 249 NY 458, 464).

 The courts of this state have been steadfast in enforcing
Cardozo's maxim. No one could read this sorry record and
conclude that the Duke estate has been provided with the loyal
and honorable service that the law demands.

 Any one of the actions of either fiduciary standing alone might
constitute sufficient grounds for his or its removal (see,
Birnbaum v Birnbaum, supra [conflict of interest/ divided
loyalty]; Matter of Cady, 36 Hun 122, affd 103 NY 678
[improvidence/ substance abuse]; DePicabia v Chester Nat. Bank,
50 AD2d 812 [commingling of estate and personal assets]; Matter
of Israel, 64 Misc 2d 1035 [conflict of interest/ divided
loyalty]; Matter of Dolansky, 196 Misc 802 [alcoholism/
substance abuse]; Matter of Grossman, 157 Misc 164, affd 250 App
Div 503, lv denied, 275 NY 650 [commingling]; Matter of Phyfe,
115 Misc 699 [improvidence/ want of understanding]; Matter of
Leopold, NYLJ, May 3, 1995, at 35, col 6 [conflict of interest/
divided loyalty]; Matter of Brandon, NYLJ, Nov. 18, 1993, at 35,
col 1 [waste]; Matter of Metakes, NYLJ, Aug. 13, 1993, at 22,
col 2 [improvidence]; Matter of Diamond, NYLJ, Nov. 8, 1991, at
25, col 2 [improvidence]; Matter of Forte, NYLJ, Aug. 6, 1991,
at 22, col [waste]).

 The Court finds that the full panoply of undisputed actions
demonstrates such a serious lack of understanding of appropriate
fiduciary responsibility that immediate removal of both
fiduciaries is warranted as a matter of law (see, Matter of
Rothko, supra; Meinhard v Salmon, supra). There being no
disputed issues of fact as to the grounds upon which this
decision to remove is based, no evidentiary hearing is required
(SCPA 719; Matter of Birnbaum, 191 AD2d 227; DePicabia v Chester
Nat. Bank, supra; Matter of Iolas, NYLJ, Mar. 23, 1993, at 23,
col 2).

 Accordingly, Lafferty and U.S. Trust are removed as preliminary
executors effective immediately. They are directed to file their
account within sixty (60) days of the date of this order.

 The propounded will does not designate successor executors.
[FN9] While in the ordinary estate it would not be necessary to
appoint both an individual and a corporate temporary
administrator, there is nothing ordinary about this estate. Ms.
Duke intended that her assets create one of the largest vehicles
for dispensing charity in the world. The Court has the
responsibility to assure that decedent's determination tobenefit
the public be fulfilled and that the estate is
administered without waste or mismanagement. This task requires
the resources and the investment and management expertise of a
corporate fiduciary. It also requires an individual with the
intelligence, imagination and integrity to supervise the
transfer to the charitable beneficiaries in a manner that will
achieve Ms. Duke's goals.

 Alexander D. Forger, Esq. is uniquely qualified to perform that
role. He is appointed as the individual temporary administrator
upon duly qualifying in accordance with law. Morgan Guaranty
Trust Company of New York is appointed corporate temporary
administrator upon duly qualifying in accordance with law.

 This decision constitutes the order and decree of the Court.

 Dated: May 22, 1995

 END NOTES

 1 In September and October, 1993, at a time when her medical
prognosis was grim and her mental capacity questionable, Duke
purportedly authorized gifts in excess of $16,000,000 to various
individuals and charities. The gifts included $500,000 to Dr.
Glassman and approximately $56,000 to Lafferty.

 2 Lafferty's salary was increased from $40,000 to $100,000 in
mid-1993.

 3 Lafferty's doctor prescribed a number of mind-altering drugs,
including anti-depressants (Prozac, Effexor, Paxil, Imipramine,
Pamelor, Desyrel and Lithium), anti-psychotics (Tegretol,
Risperdal and Haldol), anti-anxiety medications (Klonopin,
Xanax, Valium, Depakote, Phenobarbital and Ativan) and sleeping
pills (Halcion, Restoril and Ambien). On a single day (August
26, 1994) Lafferty filled the following prescriptions: 100
Lithium carbonate 300 mg; 100 Trazodyne 150 mg; 100 Ambien 5 mg;
100 Effexor 75 mg; 30 Klonopin 2 mg; 100 Toprol 100 mg.

 His doctor asserts that the drugs enabled Lafferty to become
"more functional," made his emotions "manageable," and allowed
him to feel more "'in balance' and in touch with himself and his
world."

 4 The Court notes the Report's criticism of U.S. Trust's
decision to invest all of the estate's liquid assets in short-
term fixed-yield investments (without any equity component).
Questions regarding the propriety of the bank's investment
strategy must await the accounting.

 5 No such application was made.

 6 This sanguine prediction disregards the fact that a fiduciary
appointment is not simply an honorific, with automatic
entitlement to compensation (Matter of Goldstick, 177 AD2d 225,
mod on other grounds, 183 AD2d 684). Where a fiduciary's
wrongdoing is sufficiently egregious, commissions may be denied
(Matter of Donner, 82 NY2d 574).

 7 The President of U.S. Trust admits that he stated to Mr. Kuh
that with estate assets of over one billion dollars, he was not
"overly concerned with some reupholstering and some furniture"
but states that his remark was "taken out of context".

 8 No support is given for this prediction, which the Court
rejects. If, as U.S. Trust claims, administration is all but
concluded there should be minimal duplication of effort.

 9 The Court will therefore issue letters of temporary
administration (SCPA 901). The Court has discretion in the
choice of temporary administrators (Matter of Pearson, 228 App
Div 418).

                          Foreword

          My April 20, 1995 Report ("the Report") to Your
Honor noted (at page 63) that the preliminary executors had,
refusing to waive confidentiality agreements, blocked my
access to either Chandi Heffner or her attorneys, and to two
former Duke Farms security employees.  The Surrogate having
strongly advised that the preliminary executors, through
counsel, waive such confidentiality provisions, that same
afternoon I was informed of such waivers.

          As a result, since my submission of the Report, I
have interviewed Chandi Heffner's attorneys and Chandi
Heffner, who now lives in Hawaii, by means of a lengthy long
distance phone call conducted with her attorneys present with
me.  I have also now met with Irwin Bloom and Frank
Senerchia, each accompanied by his attorney, and with Peter
Wilczek.

          As Your Honor is aware, Heffner is Duke's daughter
(by adoption) and for several years prior to February 1991
assisted Doris Duke in managing her properties.  Irwin Bloom
had served for more than a decade, initially as accountant
and then financial advisor and -- after a fashion -- as
manager for Duke; Bloom had been named as executor and
trustee pursuant to Duke's November 1991 Will.  Wilczek was
in charge of security for the Duke properties in Somerville,
New Jersey, from May 1982 until June 1993; his father and
mother still reside on the Somerville property where they had
been employed, and his mother still works there part-time.
Senerchia, a retired New York City police detective, was
retained as an independent contractor in charge of security
at Duke Farms, and in overall charge of security at all Duke
properties from September 1, 1993 through October 13, 1993,
and again from early November 1993 through early August 1994.
Each, except Wilczek, had received a copy of the Report from
counsel for each, and each expressed a belief in the accuracy
of those portions of the Report with which each had had
familiarity.

          Heffner, Bloom and Wilczek have each settled such
claims as each had with the Duke Estate.  (Senerchia brought
no claim.)  I have been given copies, on a confidential
basis, of the settlement agreements with Heffner and Bloom.
Wilczek received a mid-five-figure sum settling a suit he had
instituted against the Duke Estate and Senerchia received the
equivalent of three weeks pay by way of accrued vacation time
and a termination payment.

          In light of these settlements, and the Estate's
waiver of the confidentiality agreements to the extent
necessary to permit frank discussion with me, little reason
remains -- other than possibly long entertained, and hence
not readily dissipated, biases -- for each to have slanted
what each told me.

          The Report had the benefit of a substantial amount
of documentation (some of which had been obtained for me
through the services rendered by Price Waterhouse ("PW")),
and the further benefit of the informed statements to me of
many persons.  This Supplemental Report is far less revealing
than the Report.  While the Report, essentially, expressed
near-ultimate facts distilled from a potpourri of
information, this Supplement consists largely of detail from
the four recently interviewed sources, detail that
essentially lends further support to facts previously set
forth in the Report.

          While it was feasible in the Report to protect the
identity of a number of the individuals with whom I met prior
to rendering the Report, that is not feasible in this
Supplement.

A.   Concerning Possible Improvidence
     on the Part of Bernard Lafferty


          (2)  Substantial Luxury Expenditures. -- The Report
(Rep. p. 8) comments on Bernard Lafferty's purchase from
Cartier for almost $35,000 of a second gold and diamond watch
for himself, and refers to Exhibit 10.  At the time the
Report was finalized, although KMZ had then cooperated in
asking Cartier's aid, Cartier had not yet supplied documents
explaining the charge, as reflected on Exhibit 10, of
$34,780.73.  Thereafter documents were supplied, and
explained by the Cartier Boutique store manager, that this in
fact was for the purchase of a single gold and diamond watch.

          (3)  Haphazard Credit Card Use. -- The Report (Rep.
pp. 8-9) deals with Lafferty's use of credit cards, and
appends (as Exhibit 11) a page analyzing the use of his
personal American Express card, and the charges against it
from December 1993 through October 1994, approximately
three-quarters of which were in fact personal charges and
one-quarter of which were Duke Estate charges.  I had noted
on that Exhibit that Katten Muchin & Zavis ("KMZ") had
withheld Lafferty's American Express personal charges
reflected in statements subsequent to October 1994.  As a
result of Your Honor's statements in open Court on April 25,
1995, suggesting that confidentiality claims be waived, KMZ
(at my request) sent me the previously withheld American
Express personal charges for the period from November 1994
through February 1995.  With the addition of those charges,
PW has re-figured the chart that is a part of Exhibit 11, and
as re-figured it is as appended hereto as Exhibit 63.

B.   Concerning Possible Substance Abuse or
     Drunkenness on the Part of Bernard Lafferty


          (3)  Post-Duke Binges. -- The Report (Rep.
pp. 12-13) reflects Lafferty's February 1994 binge at the
Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach, his being transported to New
Jersey after brief hospitalization in Florida, and thereafter
his being flown, on the Duke plane, to Los Angeles, attended
by Dr. Harry Glassman.  Senerchia was in charge of security
at Duke Farms during this period and was in contact with his
two security people, Marc Hamilton (now Duke Farms' security
director) and Rick Dixon, both -- pursuant to Lafferty's
request -- having accompanied Lafferty to Florida for
purposes of affording him protection.

          Senerchia -- who had heard from Hamilton of some
problem with Lafferty -- stated that he received a telephone
call from Lafferty, then in Florida, cursing, screaming and
accusing Senerchia of unwelcome prying into his (Lafferty's)
personal life.  Thereafter, after Lafferty had been flown to
Duke Farms and had spent several days there, Senerchia and
Hamilton drove Lafferty, Nuku Makasiale and Colin Shanley to
a New Jersey airport to be taken to Los Angeles, by way of
Chicago, in the Duke plane.  Senerchia described Lafferty as
then still being either quite ill or quite intoxicated, and
said that he (Senerchia) and Hamilton had to physically carry
Lafferty onto the plane, which had been flown in from
California with Dr. Glassman aboard.

C.   Concerning Possible Want of Understanding
     on the Part of Bernard Lafferty        


          (4)  General Understanding. -- I recognize that the
statutory use of the phrase "want of understanding" does not
on its face appear to reflect on whether the named fiduciary
has an understanding of the legal and moral obligations of a
fiduciary.  Yet a makeweight Your Honor may wish to consider
is whether one designated to create a new massive charitable
foundation -- and to serve as a trustee of that new
foundation -- should have a temperament reflecting charitable
concerns and an ability to empathize with others.

          From Senerchia I received a copy of a letter that
he had received at Somerville under date of April 21, 1994,
as well as his memorandum to Lafferty concerning that letter,
and the endorsement (not in Lafferty's hand) countersigned by
Lafferty. (Exhibit 64).  The letter is from a woman stating
that her father had worked on the Duke estate for more than
forty years, that she had two young daughters who had never
known their grandfather, and that she -- by her letter -- was
seeking permission to tour the dairy barn in which her father
had been employed, and the house on the estate in which he
had lived and in which she was born.  The endorsement that
Lafferty countersigned said simply "No tours on the property
at any time.  We do not know who these people are and
Clorinda [a DBO employee] has enough work to do."

D.   Concerning Possibly "Wasted or Improperly Applied . . .
     or Otherwise Improvidently Managed" Assets           


          (2)  Post-Duke Rising Expenses. -- The Report (Rep.
pp. 20-21) notes that personnel increases after Duke's death
were, according to the preliminary executors, their counsel
and DBO personnel, justified by mounting security needs.

          Bloom (who remained with the Duke organization
until terminated on June 8, 1993) had discussed security
matters with Duke and stated that she never expressed any
desire to see security personnel at Duke Farms "beefed up."
Her interest was in taking whatever existed and making it
work more effectively.  Bloom had been dissatisfied with
Wilczek as head of security and sent Duke faxes suggesting
personnel changes, but not overall increases in security
staff numbers.  As noted hereinafter (Supplement, F-4), in
the Spring of 1993, Bloom had been unable to get through to
Duke to discuss this and other matters.

          Wilczek, who headed Duke Farms security until June
1993, saw no need to increase the size of the security staff
as Duke Farms was not plagued with crime.  He stated that it
operated comfortably with a staff of about ten persons.

          Heffner, through her attorneys, had described the
security system at Somerville as a "Mr. Magoo system"; she,
too, saw no need for increasing security personnel.

          Senerchia, a police and security professional,
stated there were no serious security problems at Somerville,
no meaningful crime.  There were trespassers, persons hunting
and fishing without permission on the approximately
2,700 acre estate (not completely effectively fenced in);
there were sightseers, and occasionally minor property damage
on the land (a broken tractor window, a slashed tire, etc.).
But there had been no break-ins into the houses on the
estate.

          Nonetheless, as a professional, Senerchia saw the
need to increase the security staff from about ten to about
twenty-five persons.  He was candid in stating his own
recognition that security directors (as is also true in other
areas of endeavor!) always wished to increase their staffs to
guard against problems arising down the line.  He also stated
that the staff increases he effectuated were in part a
response to overtime that the initial small staff was
compelled to devote.  He added that personnel needs were
further aggravated by Lafferty's desire to be accompanied by
both a driver -- taken from the security staff -- and an
additional security person, apart from the driver.  When
Lafferty traveled to Florida (to attend a deposition in the
Heffner litigation), and to Falcon's Lair in California, he
was accompanied by two security persons (all traveling first-
class).

          Moreover, Lafferty, when at Duke Farms, on occasion
requested security persons to drive to and from Philadelphia,
or local airports, to pick up friends of his, and to bring
them back to Duke Farms.

          Senerchia further stated that U.S. Trust and
Lafferty invariably approved of all of his requests, both for
personnel and equipment for his security force.  The only
requests that failed to receive favorable action were those
for a monitoring television network, and for electronic
gate-openers, etc.; these requests were not expressly
rejected, but no action was taken concerning them.  Senerchia
noted that Lafferty had directed that he (Lafferty) was not
to be logged in and out, although security personnel long had
had directions to log all persons entering and leaving the
Somerville properties.  Also Lafferty expressly made clear
that he did not wish to have video monitors filming the Duke
house and immediately adjacent grounds.

          Senerchia was never queried by Lafferty or U.S.
Trust personnel as to weighing the need for a twenty-five (or
so) person security force, against the expense involved and
the essentially crime-free history of Duke Farms with a far
smaller security force.


          (3)  Specific "Home-Making" Expenses. -- The Report

(Rep. pp. 21-24) deals with expenditures, principally at
Falcon's Lair, involving reupholstering and (for the most
part) renovations to Duke's private bathroom and bedroom
there.

          When I had, many weeks ago, interviewed Cupie Singh
("Cupie"), the Duke Farms housekeeper, in the presence of a
KMZ attorney, she expressed no complaints concerning
Lafferty.  Senerchia reported that, as Lafferty had done at
Falcon's Lair, Lafferty had moved into the Duke bedroom at
Duke Farms after Duke's death, and had utilized Duke's
bedroom and bed as his own.  Candid about his own failure to
have gotten along with Cupie, Senerchia noted her statements
that Duke "would never have allowed him [Lafferty] to do the
things he is doing," and commented specifically to Senerchia
"Can you believe he is sleeping in Miss Duke's bed?"  He
further commented hearing from Cupie that Lafferty had
changed furniture and moved paintings and other decorations
to suit his own tastes at Duke Farms.

          (6)  Miscellaneous Expenses. -- The Report
(Rep. p. 26) comments on the reactivation, at Duke Farms, of
a pistol firing range in order that security personnel might
hone their firearm skills.  Senerchia informed me that this
had been suggested while he was in charge of security.  He
further stated that as there were firing ranges available for
practice in the Somerville area, he saw no need for
activating the pistol range at Duke Farms.  Moreover, he
noted that the sound of gun fire would be disturbing to
neighbors as well as a negative when public tours of Duke
Gardens took place.  (Senerchia noted, however, that
Hamilton, who had served as Lafferty's bodyguard/chauffeur,
and who eventually succeeded Senerchia as chief of security
at Duke Farms, had approved of the firing range's
reactivation.)
E.   Concerning Honesty or Possible Dishonesty

          (1)  Sizable Pre-Death Gifts. -- The Report (Rep.
pp. 29 and 32) notes that a "loan" of $900,000 was made to
Dr. Rolando Atiga in September 1993, and that quite
substantial earlier loans (made in early 1992), in excess of
$400,000, remained unpaid.  Bloom stated that these earlier
Atiga loans had been discussed by him with Duke who
recognized that, in all probability, they would never be
repaid.  Bloom also noted that Duke had made other extremely
large loans without any real expectation of repayment.

          Bloom pointed out that although Duke's personal
income had been as large as $70 million a year, and that
quite apart from funds that were distributed through the
Doris Duke Foundation (created during her lifetime) and other
Duke foundations, Duke donated charitably very little of this
personal income, and then ordinarily in small amounts to
particular charitable causes in which she had an interest.

          Heffner similarly commented that Duke rarely made
"uncommitted charitable gifts"; that her gifts ordinarily
were for specific purposes.  Heffner further commented that
ordinarily Duke did not believe in "celebrity type
charities."

          Appended as Exhibit 65-67 are selected pages from
the Duke 1992, 1991 and 1990 personal federal Gift Tax
returns.  The 1992 return shows gifts only to the Doris Duke
Foundation, Inc. from Duke of $755,000; it also contains a
schedule of prior gifts which, from 1982 through 1991 show no
gifts except gifts in 1986 totalling $1,504,670
(identification of the earlier donees not required by the
form) and gifts in 1988 of $40,886, with no gifts for 1989,
1990 or 1991.  The 1991 federal Gift Tax return reflects only
a gift to the Nature Conservancy in Arlington, Virginia, of
real estate, the donor's basis being approximately $411,000
and the value as of the date of the gift being $2,725,000.
The 1990 federal Gift Tax return shows a single gift of
$18,700 to the John Carter Brown Library in Newport, Rhode
Island.

          These essentially sparse gifts contrast with the
gifts made on October 3-5, 1993, during the last month of
Duke's life, of a million dollars to the Elizabeth Taylor
AIDS Foundation, of a million dollars to the People for
Ethical Treatment of Animals, and of two million dollars to
Duke University. (Ex. 36).

          Interestingly, as the media have noted, Lafferty
has already named persons to the Board of the Duke Charitable
Trust, the Trust to be created pursuant to the April 5, 1993
Will.  Among those who Lafferty has said have accepted
appointments to the Board are Nannerl Keohane, President of
Duke University, J. Carter Brown, retired Director of the
National Gallery of Art (and of the family of John Carter
Brown for whom the Newport Rhode Island Library was named)
and Elizabeth Taylor.  As noted, the John Carter Brown
Library received a gift from Duke in 1990 and the Elizabeth
Taylor AIDS Foundation as well as Duke University were
generously treated as Duke lay dying in early October 1993.

          (3)  Duke's Cremation. --  The Report (Rep. pp.
33-40) deals with the Duke cremation, and considers what
Duke's instructions had been with regard to the disposition
of her remains.

          Bloom stated that he had known from Duke of her
general fear of fire.  She had informed Bloom that she wished
her body buried at sea, and that she that she so informed
William Zabel who prepared her November 1991 Will.

          Wilczek stressed Duke's significant concern with
fire prevention at Duke Farms, and that the smoke and fire
detection systems be operating effectively.  He stated that
having been aware of this deep concern of Duke's, he was
surprised when he learned that her remains had been cremated.
(His understanding -- although the source of that
understanding was not made clear, and he is the only source
of this -- was that she wanted her body entombed at Duke
University near her father's remains.)

          Heffner stated that she and Duke shared a common
virtually pantheistic belief, finding God in the forces of
nature.  Duke believed in personal gods, known in Hawaiian
lore as aumakua.  With her love of the ocean, Duke's aumakua
was Mano, the sacred shark.  Duke believed, in essence, in
"giving something back to the ocean" for the happiness it had
given her, and so she wished her body fed to Mano, to the
sharks.

          Moreover, Heffner stated that Duke was terrified of
fire.  She (Duke) and Heffner had flown over an active
Hawaiian volcano, making offerings to it, in order to appease
Pele, the Hawaiian God of Fire.  Heffner insisted there was
no way that Duke could have wished to have her remains
cremated.

          (7)  Possible Thefts of Duke Property. -- Shortly
before the Report was finalized, served and filed on
April 20, 1995, I learned of the arrest of one of the Duke
private-duty registered nurses, Tammy Payette, for thefts
from the homes of patients, purportedly not initially
involving thefts of Duke property.  (Rep. p. 56, note 17).  I
have since learned that the parameters of the thefts with
which Payette is or may be charged have expanded, apparently
such alleged larcenies now being in the six-figure range and
including larcenies of Duke property.

          To the best of my knowledge, and although the
preliminary executors had engaged Christie's to appraise the
Duke personal property, note had not been taken prior to the
Payette arrest that Duke valuables may have been stolen from
Falcon's Lair (the sole Duke home in which Payette did
private-duty nursing).  This suggests that the preliminary
executors may not have had -- or may not have given
Christie's -- an inventory of Duke possessions, such that
when Christie's did the appraisals Christie's would have
recognized that certain listed items were not present to be
appraised.

          Prior to preparing the Report, I had been variously
informed that Duke had kept so-called "black books," a set of
such books for each of her residences, retained at the DBO,
in which all items of any significant value at each residence
were inventoried.

          I requested PW to spot-check the black book
listings against the Christie's appraisals, which were very
extensive, to determine whether or not there were any
properties listed in the black books that were no longer
about and so were not appraised by Christie's.  (Obviously,
the extent of the Duke possessions being so vast, anything
more than a spot-check, with both limited manpower and
limited time, was impossible.)  After I asked PW to do the
spot-check, I was informed by KMZ, by letter of April 3,
1995, that the black books "are not up to date (and may be
outdated by several years)." (Exhibit 68).  When on April 12,
1995, I met with Margaret Scott of the DBO -- she being
accompanied by attorneys from KMZ and Nixon, Hargrave and
Willkie, Farr -- she informed me that the black books had not
been updated for years, and therefore the cross-check that I
had in mind made no sense.  KMZ attorneys orally confirmed
this.  PW was similarly advised by KMZ and Christie's
personnel that the black books were not up-to-date, and so
were not reliable.

          Interestingly, Anthony Marshall of U.S. Trust, whom
I had interviewed on February 27, 1995, had stated that U.S.
Trust was then in the process of comparing the Christie's
appraisals with the black books.

          My recent interviewees strongly suggested that the
black books were, in fact, up-to-date, at least into
mid-1993.  Heffner stated that the books were current as of
the time she was shut out of Duke's life, in February of
1991.  She stated that not only had the black books then been
up-to-date, but she had further implemented a system for
computerizing the inventories.  Wilczek stated that in the
late 1980's and for several years running, he knew that the
inventories were kept up-to-date, because he had, at least
for several consecutive years, done a complete inventory of
Duke's possessions at Duke Farms.  He stated that when he was
terminated in mid-1993, it was his information that the black
books were up-to-date.  Bloom similarly said that up to the
time his relationship with Duke was terminated in June of
1993, the black books were up-to-date.  He spoke of his own
role in the computerization of the inventories, indicating
that the computerized inventory and the black books tracked
the movement of Duke personal property from one home to
another.

          Cupie, whom I had interviewed on February 16, 1995,
stated that the black books had been kept up-to-date,
although she may have intended this with respect to her own
Duke Farms records, apparently maintained separately from the
black books.

          Query: If the inventories were essentially
up-to-date in mid-1993 (as the three recent interviewees with
knowledge of the subject believed), were Lafferty and KMZ at
fault in not having them kept current both before and after
Duke's death?  If they were not accurate as of mid-1993,
shouldn't some priority have been given to updating them?
And if, knowingly, they have not been kept up-to-date in the
year and a half since Duke's death, have the fiduciaries and
their counsel failed to take appropriate steps to prevent any
losses of Duke's personal properties, a clear risk if
inventories were not kept current?

F.   Concerning Possible Conflicts of Interest


          (1)  Bank's Loan to Its Designating Fiduciary. --
This sub-heading, and the remaining sub-headings under this
conflicts of interest point, deal with the inter-relationship
among Lafferty, U.S. Trust and KMZ, and the conflicts and
tensions created incident to this inter-relationship. (Rep.
pp. 47-53).

          Senerchia, who as security chief for almost a year
(most of which was after Duke's death), chauffeured Lafferty
on occasion.  He reports that he once overheard a discussion
in the car between Lafferty and Doyle concerning U.S. Trust.
Apparently, U.S. Trust had, in some fashion, sought to
curtail Lafferty's credit card use.  Senerchia heard Lafferty
say to Doyle, concerning U.S. Trust, in substance, "If they
don't come around, we'll get another bank."  Senerchia said
he had heard other conversations in which Lafferty expressed
his anger with the bank.

          (4)  Complete Control Over Duke Assets. -- The
Report (Rep. pp. 51-53) comments on the control over Duke
assets granted Lafferty, and through Lafferty to KMZ,
pursuant to Duke's execution of at least two dozen documents
from March through June of 1993, at a time when Duke was in
at least a questionable mental state.  Contrasted with this
control, the Report notes the far more limited authority Duke
had previously granted to others, pursuant to documents
prepared by other attorneys who appeared to have far stronger
connections with Duke than had KMZ.

          The four persons interviewed in the last eight days
expressed other fashions in which this Lafferty control (and
hence that of KMZ) was created and solidified.  Thus, Bloom
and Heffner (as appears more fully below) noted the Lafferty
control that existed by Duke's being unavailable to others,
either face-to-face or by telephone; this was purportedly at
Duke's instruction, but inferentially because of Lafferty's
own activity in controlling access to the physically ill, and
possibly mentally erratic, Duke.  They also note the control
purportedly being solidified by feeding Duke false
information.

          Messrs. Wilczek and Senerchia suggest -- Senerchia
more strongly than Wilczek -- that control, at least over
Duke's employees, was achieved by Lafferty's verbally
abusive, loud, irrational and unjustified rages levied
against employees that put the staff in fear.

          At least from March 1993 until he was notified on
June 8, 1993 of his termination, purportedly by Duke
(Exhibit 69), Bloom said that he was unable to talk with
Duke.  He stated he phoned repeatedly but was not put
through, and ultimately, apparently in May 1993, traveled to
Hawaii to see Duke.  He was not admitted to Shangri-La.
Instead he received a telephone call from Lafferty and Alan
Croll, Esq. (of KMZ) informing him that Duke wanted him to
"go back home."  About a month later, at two meetings at his
office attended by KMZ attorneys, Bloom was criticized by the
attorneys.  Ultimately, he had an appointment to see Duke on
June 9th at Duke Farms.  However, the day before, on June 8,
1993, he received the termination letter.  Previously,
although for many years he had communicated directly with
Duke, and did not have to channel his communications through
Lafferty, Bloom had been told to communicate with Duke
through Lafferty.  He recognized the growing presence of KMZ
attorneys in every decision purportedly made by Duke.

          Despite the loving relationship between Heffner and
Duke from 1985 to February 1991, resulting in Heffner's
formal adoption by Duke in 1988, it had been Heffner's
experience that virtually every request or expense still
required Duke's approval, her "DD" initialing.  Heffner
stated that giving others broad authority over her affairs
was completely out of character for Duke.  Heffner was
unaware whether Duke had executed any power of attorney in
her favor, and whether Duke had delegated to her authority to
make medical decision concerning Duke.

          Heffner, too, after her February 1991 estrangement
from Duke, made repeated efforts to reach Duke by telephone.
Although there were two telephone calls thereafter between
Heffner and Duke, one quite brief, and the other more
extensive, Heffner's other efforts to reach Duke resulted in
her learning that a private number that rang in Duke's
bedroom at Duke Farms had been disconnected.  When she called
repeatedly thereafter she was told that Duke was unavailable
and would not speak to her.

          At around the time substantial loans, that in 1992
were to exceed $400,000, were in process of being made by
Duke to Dr. Atiga, Bloom reported that Lafferty had told him
that Dr. Atiga had chelated Duke (I am informed that
chelation, as sometimes performed, is a process of having
one's own blood transfused, testing it and purifying it when
it is out of the body), and purportedly had found strychnine
and lead in Duke's blood.  This report confirmed for Duke her
suspicions that Heffner had been poisoning her.  Heffner
believes that these suspicions had been sown by Lafferty and
Dr. Harry Demopoulos.  (When, on March 17, 1995, I questioned
Dr. Atiga in Los Angeles, in the presence of two partners
from KMZ, he denied ever having chelated Duke.)

          In three telephone conversations between Wilczek
and Lafferty, Wilczek was told by Lafferty that Duke was
listening on the speakerphone, but in such conversations
Wilczek never heard Duke's voice.  Similarly, Senerchia was
told when business meetings were held at Duke Farms that Duke
was on the speakerphone, but he, too, never heard Duke's
voice.

          In preparing the Report, I had interviewed a number
of persons employed at Falcon's Lair and at Duke Farms, as
well as employees of the DBO (physically located on the
Somerville properties).  Although I then noted my concern
over the "chilling effect" resulting from the presence of
attorneys representing the preliminary executors at each such
interview, such attorneys were present and taking notes
throughout.  I indicated to the interviewees my preference
that the attorneys be excused.  They were not.  I anticipated
that the attorneys would report what was said to Lafferty and
possibly to U.S. Trust.

          Both Senerchia and Wilczek expressed, of their own
knowledge, the "fear" harbored by Estate employees (whether
domestics or DBO personnel) of Lafferty, Senerchia expressing
this more strongly.  They indicated that Lafferty has shown
himself to react extremely vehemently to any comment about
himself that he deemed adverse.

          My interviews with Senerchia (who was accompanied
by his own attorney, one -- I was informed -- not paid by the
Estate), and Wilczek (who was unaccompanied) were largely
free of this "chilling effect."  (Wilczek, through his
parents, still has some relationship with the Duke Estate.)

H.   Considering Whether Bernard Lafferty, U.S. Trust
     and Katten Muchin & Zavis May Be Otherwise Unfit
     for the Execution of their Office              


          (2)  Duke Mental Clarity. -- The Report (Rep.
pp. 59-62) considers Duke's mental status from March 1993 and
thereafter in connection with her capacity to have executed
Codicils in March 1993 and a new Will on April 5, 1993.

          Duke had returned to Duke Farms for a last visit in
early June 1993, and stayed for approximately a week.
Wilczek, head of security at Duke Farms during that period,
drove Duke around the area, accompanied by nurse Pearl
Rosenstein.  Although Wilczek noted that Duke was physically
weak and apparently deteriorating, he states that she was
mentally sharp at the time; Rosenstein posed many questions
to her about the property and items on it seen during the
drive, and Duke responded cogently to these inquiries.

          In contrast, he stated he had received a telephone
call from Duke some time after she had returned to the West
Coast subsequent to this last visit to Duke Farms.  He said
that he had great trouble understanding what she was saying.
Lafferty then came on the line and explained what it was that
Duke wanted.  Wilczek said that from those Duke words that he
had been able to understand he was satisfied that Lafferty
had given an accurate explanation.
Concluding Note


          This Supplemental Report, as noted, essentially
reflects information received from four persons to whom
access had earlier been blocked, and whose information
essentially confirms that presented in the Report.  Although
there are still others who might be interviewed, insofar as
such others may be free agents under no pressures other than
that of truthfulness, I have no reason to believe that
further investigation would materially affect the facts
considered in the Report.

          Again, I thank the Court for honoring me with this
appointment.

Dated:  May 5, 1995                Respectfully submitted,

<P>When tobacco heiress Doris Duke died in 1993, she left a $1.2 billion estate and no natural heirs. She left most of her money to charity and willed $5 million to her butler and friend Bernard Lafferty. Lafferty also was named co-executor of the estate.  But a court-appointed investigator looking into Duke's death has raised questions about how she died. The report by investigator Richard Kuh said that Duke's doctor caused her death with a fatal overdose of morphine. Kuh's investigation was ordered by a judge who has been trying to settle a legal fight between several of Duke's heirs. Kuh was asked to investigate allegations that Duke was murdered.  Here is Kuh's report.</P>

STATE OF NEW YORK
SURROGATE'S COURT: COUNTY OF NEW YORK
------------------------------------X
                                      File No. 4440/93
Probate Proceeding, Will of         
                                      E. Preminger, Surrogate
         DORIS DUKE,
                                      REPORT OF RICHARD H. KUH,
               Deceased.              LIMITED TEMPORARY ADMINISTRATOR
------------------------------------X

                        Introduction

          This Report is made pursuant to Your Honor's Order
of January 20, 1995 ("the Order"), designating me limited
temporary administrator for the Estate of Doris Duke ("the
Estate") and directing that I report within forty-five days
(by March 6, 1995).  On March 6, 1995, Your Honor orally
extended that time for an additional forty-five days (until
April 20, 1995) at a conference among the Surrogate and
counsel.

          The Order directed that I "examine the allegations
of misconduct, examine the affairs of the estate, [and]
conduct interviews to the extent deemed necessary . . . ." It
specified that I was named pursuant to the Surrogate's Court
Procedure Act Section 702(8), (9) and (10) (hereinafter,
references to that Act are abbreviated, "SCPA"), and provided
that I was to "be accorded unrestricted access to all documents,
books and records relating to the estate."  "The parties and
their counsel," the Order further said, "are directed to
cooperate with [me] to the fullest extent."
          The Order had taken note of the "serious and
sensational allegations . . . with respect to both the
qualifications of Bernard Lafferty to serve as a fiduciary
and the conduct of Mr. Lafferty and his counsel during the
period preceding and subsequent to Ms. Duke's death," and
further that "[o]ther charges [had been] made with regard to
the co-preliminary executor, U.S. Trust Co."
          Pursuant to the Order, this Report considers the
conduct of the co-fiduciaries and of their counsel,
principally Katten Muchin & Zavis ("KMZ"), concerning the
affairs of the Estate as authorized by Article 7 of the
Surrogate's Court Procedure Act:

       SCPA Section 702(8) deals with conflicts of interest of
         acting fiduciaries.
       SCPA Section 702(9) deals with a fiduciary's failure to
         bring an appropriate proceeding.
       SCPA Section 702(10) broadly authorizes letters for "any
         other purpose or act deemed by the court to be
         appropriate or necessary in respect of the
         affairs of the estate . . . or the proper
         administration thereof."
       SCPA Section 707(1)(e) specifies that a person is
         ineligible to serve as a fiduciary "who does not
         possess the qualifications required of a
         fiduciary by reason of substance abuse,
         dishonesty, improvidence, want of understanding,
         or who is otherwise unfit for the execution of
         the office."
       SCPA Section 707(2) provides that "The court may declare
         ineligible to act as a fiduciary a person unable
         to read and write the English language."
       SCPA Section 711(2) provides, inter alia, for
         disqualification of a fiduciary "by reason of his
         having wasted or improperly applied the assets of
         the estate . . . or otherwise improvidently
         managed or injured the property committed to his
         charge or by reason of . . . dishonesty,
         drunkenness, improvidence or want of
         understanding [such that] he is unfit for the
         execution of his office."
       SCPA Section 711(8) provides, inter alia, for
         disqualification where the person "does not
         possess the qualifications required of a
         fiduciary by reason of substance abuse,
         dishonesty, improvidence, want of understanding,
         or who is otherwise unfit for the execution of
         the office."

       The preliminary co-executors of the Estate, Bernard
Lafferty ("Lafferty") and the United States Trust Company of
New York ("U.S. Trust"), through counsel, have previously
questioned the scope of my inquiry.  I have sought to explore
-- within the span of ninety days (relatively brief, in light
of the multiple allegations of misconduct and the fact that
the Petition for Probate herein was filed just short of a
year and a half ago) -- "the allegations of misconduct" that
have been made, and to "examine the affairs of the estate"
including the propriety of Lafferty, U.S. Trust, and their
counsel, to continue to serve in this matter.

       It is my understanding of my role as limited
temporary administrator that I am not to be judgmental or to
draw conclusions from the facts that I have learned; I am
to report such facts as my inquiry has revealed which the
Surrogate, applying the law, may or may not deem call for
further action pursuant to the relevant SCPA provisions.  I
stress that facts are specified herein either because I see
some potential for the Surrogate deeming each such fact
relevant, or because the fact specified -- although quite
possibly, were it to be viewed alone, falling below the legal
threshold that calls for court action pursuant to the SCPA --
may, along with all other facts, be deemed by Your Honor to
suggest that the preliminary executors (or their counsel) are
"otherwise unfit to serve," as provided by the SCPA.

       I do not suggest that every fact included in this
Report must be relevant, or that each fact -- or even the
totality of all of the facts -- should trigger action by the
Surrogate.  But not to have exposed each fact set forth in
this Report for consideration by Your Honor would, I believe,
have been inappropriate judgmental editing on my behalf.
       I have categorized my fact findings under eight
headings (A through H, which follow), relying upon the
relevant provisions of the SCPA.  In doing so, I have placed
each fact under one major heading only.  I have not cross-
referenced facts under other headings, but obviously some
facts logically belong under more than one heading.

A.   Concerning Possible Improvidence on the Part
  of Bernard Lafferty (SCPA Sections 707(1)(e), 711(2)
  and (8); see also SCPA Section 711(10))           

       (1)  Massive Debt. -- Lafferty was a person with
essentially no assets (Exhibit 5) until -- at the earliest --
Doris Duke's last months.  His annual income had been
approximately $40,000 a year until the summer of 1993 when it
was raised to $100,000 annually.  He has made no visible
effort to live within his means until, at best, quite
recently.  During the near year and a half since Duke's death
he continues to live, at absolutely no expense to himself,
using the various Duke residences as his homes, his meals,
cleaning, laundry and such services being furnished by
domestics employed by the Duke Business Office ("DBO"), he
has chauffeured transportation, free telephone, free medical
services, accounting services supplied by the DBO and
attorney services provided by and through KMZ; there are
minimal charges for pharmaceuticals.

       Between November 26, 1993 and January 4, 1995, a
period of just over thirteen months, Lafferty borrowed a
total of $825,000 from his co-fiduciary, U.S. Trust.
(Exhibit 6).  Additionally, in the eighteen months since
Duke's death on October 28, 1993 -- through the end of this
month of April 1995 -- he will have received approximately
$150,000 in salary as "Executive Assistant to Miss Duke" (at
$100,000 a year), which salary has continued despite her
demise.  During the same period, he incurred unpaid American
Express charges which, as of February 1995, exceeded $89,000.
(Exhibit 7), and which remain unpaid.  At one point --
apparently early May 1994 -- his checking account at U.S.
Trust was overdrawn. (Exhibit 8).  Hence, quite apart from
his living expenses having been provided at virtually no cost
to Lafferty, his total expenditures during this eighteen
month period appear to well exceed $1 million.

       (2)  Substantial Luxury Expenditures. -- Lafferty's
expenditures during the period of December 1993 through
November 1994, as reflected on his American Express charge
card, at seven major retailers -- Cartier, Giorgio Armani,
Louis Vuitton, Neiman Marcus, Yves St. Laurent, Barney's and
Jonathan Kent -- totalled in excess of $155,000. (Exhibit 9).
The Cartier charge included his purchase for almost $35,000
of a second gold and diamond watch for himself. (Exhibit 10).
(By affidavit of May 2, 1994 -- previously filed in this
Court -- Lafferty had stated that Duke, for his birthday in
April 1993, had given him a watch so described.)

       (3)  Haphazard Credit Card Use. -- Lafferty appears
to charge items to his personal and corporate credit cards
without great care as to whether the purchase is for personal
use or is a proper Estate charge. (Exhibit 11).  The DBO
reviews these charges and reallocates them -- after
discussion with Lafferty -- either to him as personal
charges, or to the DBO.  Apart from his own possible
inability to differentiate personal and Estate charges, the
delays inherent in this process have effectively provided
Lafferty with short term DBO loans.  (DBO personnel state
that Lafferty is now, more than a year after becoming a
fiduciary, improving in this regard, for the most part
charging personal items on his personal credit card and
business items on DBO cards.)

       (4)  Insolvency. -- Lafferty was, and remains,
insolvent.  However, if the April 5, 1993 Will is admitted to
probate, Lafferty is to receive a bequest of $500,000
annually for life (Article Five (C)(2) and (C)(6)(a)), as
well as several million dollars in executor's commissions and
trustees' fees.  Moreover, even were the April 5, 1993 Will
not to be admitted to probate, Lafferty -- having already
served as preliminary executor for approximately eighteen
months -- has an expectancy of quite significant fiduciary
commissions.

B.   Concerning Possible Substance Abuse or Drunkenness
  on the Part of Bernard Lafferty (SCPA Sections 707(1)(e),
  711(2) and (8))                                  

       (1)  Alcoholism. -- In his May 6, 1987 application
for employment with Duke, Lafferty responded to the question
"Have you ever or do you presently need professional help for
alcohol or drug abuse?", by checking the "Yes" line; by way
of explanation, he added, "Alcohol I am a member of A.A."
(Exhibit 12).  Duke was aware of Lafferty's problems with
alcohol at the time she employed him and thereafter, and
apparently was pleased that -- for the most part -- while
employed by her he did not abuse alcohol.

       Anthony Marshall, Senior Vice President of U.S.
Trust ("Marshall"), who as such works with Lafferty in
connection with the Estate, has, by affidavit herein of
January 18, 1995, indicated his awareness that Lafferty "is a
recovering alcoholic for which he . . . receives treatment."

       In one of Lafferty's own handwritten notes,
Lafferty wrote "MY DRINKIG IS NOT THE PROPLMEN.  IT IS
HEFFNER." (Exhibit 13)

       (2)  Medical Care. -- From February 1994 to the
present, Lafferty has been under the care primarily of
Dr. Michael Horwitz ("Dr. Horwitz"), a Los Angeles internist
and the Director of the Division of Substance Abuse at
Cedars-Sinai.  (Dr. Horwitz was brought in on the
recommendation of Dr. Charles Kivowitz ("Dr. Kivowitz"),
Duke's primary physician who also has treated Lafferty;
they share a medical suite with Dr. Joshua Trabulus -- who,
ultimately, was to sign the Duke death certificate -- and
others.)  Dr. Horwitz's records include a page dated August
1994 -- about six months after Lafferty became his patient --
reflecting the Lafferty diagnosis as "alcoholic."
(Exhibit 14).  Interviewed, Dr. Horwitz stated that he does
not currently view Lafferty as an alcoholic, but as a person
who on sporadic occasions reacts to depression, tensions and
other problems by alcoholic binges.

       Dr. Horwitz has been heavily medicating Lafferty
for his depressions, stress reactions, tremors, alcohol
problems, etc., and now reports favorably concerning
Lafferty's abilities to function with the assistance of the
prescribed medications.  Counsel for the preliminary
executors, and personnel of the co-preliminary executor, U.S.
Trust, also report that Lafferty functions effectively as
preliminary executor within the parameters of his skills and
abilities.

       (3)  Post-Duke Binges. -- Although Lafferty has
gone on widely-spaced alcoholic binges during his employment
by Duke and the eighteen months since her death, his profile
is not that of a current alcoholic, a person with quite
regular alcohol consumption.  Quite apart from rare
interludes of very heavy drinking while Duke was alive,
particularly during and immediately following a trip in May
1993 with Duke to her Hawaii residence, I am aware that
Lafferty has engaged in the following alcoholic binges since
Duke's death:

       February 1994, at the Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach.
       This binge is well documented.  (Exhibit 15
       consists of several pages culled from the records
       of the West Palm Beach Good Samaritan Medical
       Center to which Lafferty -- using the name Brian
       O'Conner -- was taken by William Doyle, Esq.
       ("Doyle") of KMZ on February 11, 1994.)  The record
       reflects that Lafferty was transported unconscious
       (by Fire Rescue) from the Breakers to the hospital.
       There his combativeness, abusiveness and violence
       led to his having restraints applied.  The Fire
       Rescue Medical Incident Report notes as patient's
       history, "Rehab 1 yr. ago; several relapses since."
       (Exhibit 16).  Doyle, his attorney, then stated to
       Good Samaritan, he "does require detoxification and
       alcohol rehabilitation in spite of the patient's
       protestations to the contrary" (Bates numbered page
       K0000694).  He was discharged and then transported
       to New Jersey (with Doyle and others), and then by
       the Duke plane to Los Angeles (via Chicago) with
       Dr. Harry Glassman ("Dr. Glassman") aboard
       administering medical care.  He was immediately
       hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai and remained there for
       several days, attended by Dr. Horwitz.

       July 1994, when the Heffner litigations were
       apparently settled, Lafferty appeared intoxicated
       at a fine New York City restaurant.  He and the
       attorneys were there celebrating the settlement.
       He was transported to the Duke home in Sommerville,
       New Jersey.

       October 1994, while at the Duke home in
       Sommerville, New Jersey, Lafferty was reported to
       have had another significant alcoholic episode of
       several days duration.

       December 1994, during the Christmas holiday season,
       Lafferty was reported to have experienced another
       significant alcoholic episode, drinking "rum and
       whiskey" for two or three days running at Falcon's
       Lair, requiring house calls by Dr. Horwitz and the
       administration of intravenous medications.

       The above episodes notwithstanding, it was reported
to me that both during Duke's lifetime, and since her death,
Lafferty is generally able to function effectively within the
parameters of his skills.

       (4)  Pharmacological Evaluation. -- Dr. Ralph N.
Wharton, a psychopharmacologist and psychiatrist at Columbia
University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, whose
curriculum vitae and report are appended (Exhibit 3), has
reviewed Lafferty's medical and pharmaceutical records, as
well as records of Lafferty's hospitalization at Cedars-Sinai
in 1993 and 1994.  His report notes, inter alia, that
Lafferty received at least three sleep medications, seven
anti-depressants, three anti-psychotics and six anti-anxiety
medicines, many simultaneously.  Critically, Dr. Wharton
notes that further episodes of alcohol abuse in the future
are likely, that a full psychiatric and neurological
examination is required and that Lafferty should not be
managing complex financial matters for an appreciable time.

C.   Concerning Possible Want of Understanding, Including
  Ability to Read and Write the English Language, on the
  Part of Bernard Lafferty (SCPA Sections 707(1)(e), 707(2),
  711(2) and (8))                                     

       (1)  Writing English. -- The extent of Lafferty's
ability to write English is illustrated by the documents
appended hereto as Exhibit 17.  These were written as notes
to himself, with no intention of being seen by others.

       (2)  Reading and Comprehension. -- Lafferty's
ability to read and comprehend the English language was
explored when he was questioned by me on March 2, 1995 and
April 13, 1995.  Asked on March 2, 1995 to read aloud
section 7 of the California Statutory Form Durable Power of
Attorney for Health Care (Exhibit 18), which Duke had
executed in his favor on April 16, 1993, and which he and
Doyle utilized in making arrangements with the Los Angeles
mortuary following Duke's death, he read slowly, tripping but
once during the reading and then correcting his own error.
When questioned concerning content -- specifically, pursuant
to which provision he authorized the cremation of Duke's
remains -- Lafferty re-read the indicated section slowly to
himself, then responding incorrectly that it was pursuant to
"paragraph 4", a paragraph elsewhere in the document.  On
April 13, 1995 he misread several words of the January 19,
1993 Durable Medical Power Attorney (Exhibit 19) that Duke
had executed in his favor (the first numbered paragraph of
which I asked him to read), but his counsel's interjection
prevented any evaluation of his comprehension of what he
read.

       (3)  Reading and Being Read To. -- Nurse Tammy
Payette reported that Lafferty often asked Duke's private
duty nurses to read to him the names of medications on bottle
labels.  Duke's former chef, Colin Shanley, and Nuku
Makasiale ("Nuku"), the Falcon's Lair housekeeper, each
stated that, on occasion, Lafferty had asked each of them to
read to him.  Nuku stated, however, that she had seen
Lafferty reading "business papers" by himself without
assistance, and KMZ and U.S. Trust personnel indicated
Lafferty showed familiarity with business papers.

       (4)  General Understanding. -- Several of
Lafferty's responses during my March 2, 1995 questioning also
indicated his questionable understanding, not of English but
of the extent of his own property and of the Estate's
obligations.  For example, when questioned concerning the
heavy debt he has acquired since becoming preliminary
executor, and how he may repay this debt (other than
ultimately paying out of funds that he may realize for his
services as preliminary executor and/or pursuant to the
April 5, 1993 Will), he stated he might sell some of the
antiques that he had purchased, essentially during 1994.
Asked about the value of those antiques, he estimated that
value at $60,000 or $70,000.  This was corrected by KMZ's Lee
Ann Watson and Doyle who suggested that the proper value was
about $650,000.

       Similarly, when asked if he knew the extent of the
legal fees of the KMZ law firm, as reported in the U.S.
Estate Tax return (the Form 706, which he had executed along
with U.S. Trust), he stated $30 million.  The previous day,
March 1, 1995, during my conference with Doyle, it had been
pointed out that the Form 706 reflected some $13 million in
legal fees to KMZ.  Lafferty had not then been present, but
possibly this information had been relayed to him in the
course of KMZ's preparation of him, and he may well have
misheard the figure of $13 million as $30 million, and did
not realize how extremely far out of line it would have been.

       On April 13, 1995, I questioned Lafferty as to his
general understanding of the nature of investments yielding
fixed income, and equity investments.  His responses were
simply that fixed income was a safe, stable method of
investment -- oil and gold being types of fixed income
investments (although he said that the Estate has not
invested in these things) -- and equity was a "fast way of
making money" but "not a good way when you're holding money
for a foundation."  He identified the stock market as a means
of investing in equities.  He further said that U.S. Trust
has "investment people" working on the investments, and that
he has periodic meetings with them to discuss the
investments.

       (5)  Fiduciary Services. -- The KMZ and other
attorneys for the preliminary executors, and U.S. Trust
personnel state -- not directly referring to his reading
comprehension -- that Lafferty is extremely helpful as a co-
fiduciary by virtue of his knowledge of Duke's desires and
practices and his knowledge of her various properties and of
the personnel employed on them.

D.   Concerning Possibly "Wasted or Improperly Applied . . .
  or Otherwise Improvidently Managed" Assets of the
  Estate, Attributable to Bernard Lafferty, U.S. Trust
  and Katten Muchin & Zavis (SCPA Section 711(2))             

       (1)  Improving Yield. -- A memorandum apparently
prepared by KMZ has posited that while the assets of the Duke
Estate are virtually entirely invested to yield fixed
incomes, a conservative asset allocation for a foundation
would consist of approximately fifty percent fixed income and
fifty percent equity. (Exhibit 20).  Premised on this,
the suggestion is posed that were the Estate admitted to
probate, and were it thereby to make distribution to the
foundations pursuant to the terms of the April 5, 1993 Will,
the projected return would be approximately 8.3%, while
currently the Estate is receiving approximately a 5% return.
As the Estate assets exceed one billion dollars, annualizing
this difference in projected return of 3.3% suggests to KMZ
an annual "loss" of approximately thirty-three million
dollars during the Estate's temporary administration.

       Since at least the start of my own involvement with
the Estate (as of January 20, 1995), the preliminary
executors, through counsel, have not been shy in addressing
letters and motions to the Surrogate.  As, essentially,
Duke's testamentary scheme has remained substantially
unchanged despite the number of executed testamentary
documents during the last years of her life, putting aside
changes in executors, I am aware of no reason why the
preliminary executors could not have made application to the
Court (if, acting conservatively, the Court's permission were
deemed necessary) for authority to invest in part in
equities, and to utilize long-term investment strategies
rather than the apparent short-term strategy to which the
undated KMZ memorandum refers.  Had this been done shortly
after U.S. Trust became co-preliminary executor, or even were
it to be done now, it would appear from the memorandum that
the return to the Estate could soundly be increased by
approximately $30 million annually.

       (2)  Post-Duke Rising Expenses. -- The records of
the DBO show quite significant increases following Duke's
death in previously relatively stable expenses, of several
natures, incurred in connection with the various Duke
residences ("Rough Point" in Newport, R.I., the apartment in
New York City, "Duke Farms" in Sommerville, New Jersey,
"Falcon's Lair" in Beverly Hills, California, and "Shangri-
La" in Honolulu, Hawaii).  Standing alone and without
detailed analysis, increased overall expenditures after the
death of Duke -- for whose use, enjoyment and comfort these
homes were maintained and adequately staffed, and these homes
not yet having been devoted to charitable purposes --
suggests waste.

       The salaries of employees at the managerial level,
which had historically been increased effective as of October
of each year (which increases in 1993 were apparently made,
retroactively, after Duke's death), were far more markedly
increased after Duke's death than they had been before.
(Exhibit 21).  As to such employee raises, Marshall explained
that Duke generally underpaid her staff, and that it was a
business decision of the preliminary executors as to what an
appropriate level of compensation was.

       Also the numbers of Duke employees increased
significantly after Duke's death. (Exhibit 22).  Counsel, the
preliminary executors and DBO personnel indicate that these
increases were justified by mounting security needs after
Duke's death.  Doyle stated that at a June 1993 meeting with
Duke, she stated she wished security increased and that
security upgrading began to be implemented while Duke was
still alive.  U.S. Trust, moreover, justifies the increased
security at Duke Farms and Falcon's Lair on the basis that,
despite Duke's lesser security concerns, as fiduciaries the
preliminary executors had greater responsibility than Duke
for maintaining and preserving the Estate assets before
turning them over to any trustee of a charitable foundation.

       Although Duke is gone, Lafferty has the services of
a security guard who travels with him locally, and flies with
him between the Duke homes.  The preliminary executors
continued the employment of Colin Shanley, previously Duke's
chef, after Duke's death as combination chef, houseman, and
chauffeur, essentially for Lafferty, until Shanley quit or
was terminated in mid-June 1994.  (Shanley's role did not
involve physical maintenance of the Duke properties.)  The
justification for keeping him on -- at least at some expense
to the Estate -- does not appear except as for his performing
personal chores for Lafferty.

       (3)  Specific "Home-Making" Expenses. --
Appreciable construction and refurbishing took place at the
various Duke homes, particularly at Duke Farms and Falcon's
Lair, both of which I visited.  Although cautious maintenance
certainly justified at least a portion of these expenditures,
the need for some of them -- those of a nature having nothing
to do with preventing further deterioration, but only with
making the Duke homes more comfortable during the period of
temporary administration when they are being used by Lafferty
-- appears to be at least questionable.

       In connection with these expenditures, I have in
mind that Jeffrey Maurer, President of U.S. Trust, stated
that with Estate assets of over one billion dollars, U.S.
Trust was not "overly concerned with some reupholstering and
some furniture," and other maintenance or remodeling charges.
But whether the massiveness of the Estate is a proper
yardstick for considering possible waste is not a decision
for me to make.

       Over $60,000 was spent at Falcon's Lair for
draperies, furniture reupholstering, and the like, paid to
Ellison Draperies & Interiors. (Exhibit 23).  (I was unable
to determine the precise need for such work as the principal
of Ellison was unable to meet with me.)  I am informed that
Lafferty had authorized at least some appreciable portion of
this work, which was paid for in February-April 1994 (five or
six months after Duke's death), without clearing with U.S.
Trust.  When Doyle became aware that Lafferty was
reupholstering furniture at Falcon's Lair, he advised
Lafferty and U.S. Trust that this should be deferred, the
decision ultimately to be made by the Trustees of the Doris
Duke Charitable Foundation.

       Although Lafferty stated that Duke had knowingly
neglected Falcon's Lair for years, and that his
reupholstering and other changes were part of his charge from
Duke, Eleanor Lawson ("Lawson") (one of the very few who was
permitted to visit Duke until her death and to whom Duke
bequeathed $3 million) noted that the house and furnishing
seemed to be in fair shape while Duke remained alive, noting
further that some months before Duke died a decorator had
refurnished and redecorated Duke's Falcon's Lair bedroom.
Fay and Virginia Wright of the Self-Realization Fellowship
(to which Duke made annual six figure gifts and bequeathed
one half million dollars in her Will) also were permitted to
visit Duke throughout 1993 despite her serious illness.  They
noted that Falcon's Lair had not appeared shabby or run down.

       Approximately $260,000 was spent at Falcon's Lair
on repairs and renovations paid to Campolong Construction Co.
(Exhibit 23).  Certainly, a substantial portion of this was
necessitated by January 1994 California earthquake damage.
However, U.S. Trust officials who visited Falcon's Lair after
the earthquake had found only "minor earthquake damage."
(Exhibit 24), and Falcon's Lair security personnel said the
same.  Moreover, the $260,000 included approximately $60,000
on such items as the remodeling of Duke's bedroom, used since
her death by Lafferty, including enlarging the area of glass
bedroom doors facing on a private garden, new pedestals for
statuary in this private garden, installation in Duke's
private bathroom of a spa bathtub and marble flooring.
Lafferty, who said he made these changes out of respect for
the house and Duke, concedes that the reconstruction of the
bedroom glass doors, leading to the private garden outside
the master bedroom at Falcon's Lair, made his life more
pleasant.  Similarly, his purchase of a new bed canopy
(ultimately, I am informed, charged to Lafferty personally),
improved the room's appearance, making it more attractive,
Lafferty noted, for any prospective purchaser.

       According to Robert Toretta, house manager at
Falcon's Lair since October 1994 -- interviewed in the
presence of KMZ -- some of the repairs/reconstruction at
Falcon's Lair would have been less necessary were it not that
people were living there.  Occupancy, for example, affected
the septic system, the need to upgrade the telephone system,
etc.

       (4)  New Cadillac Purchase. -- In June 1994,
Lafferty -- not an experienced driver and lacking a driver's
license -- recklessly drove and totalled a Duke Cadillac in
Los Angeles.  I was informed that some $50,000 was recovered
from the insurer, and in January 1995 a new Cadillac was
purchased in Los Angeles for approximately this amount.  The
justification for this purchase offered by Lafferty and U.S.
Trust was that Lafferty, designated to be trustee of major
foundations, would have to travel in style when in California
in connection with foundation matters.  Lafferty does not
drive but is chauffeured when in Los Angeles.  The actual use
of the Cadillac discussed by Lafferty when questioned by me
-- apart from its use for him and for U.S. Trust personnel
when in Los Angeles -- has so far been to escort Victoria
Principal, well known and apparently involved in charitable
enterprises benefitting children, to Falcon's Lair.
Ms. Principal is married to Dr. Glassman, one of Duke
physicians considered hereinafter.

       (5)  Legal Fees. -- Quite significant legal fees,
totalling just under $10,000,000, billed by a number of
different law firms, have been paid by the Estate.
(Exhibit 25).  In excess of $9,000,000 has been paid to KMZ
through February 1995.  The Estate's Form 706 reveals total
legal fees, either paid or to be paid to KMZ, of just under
$13,500,000, of which a fixed amount of $8,000,000 is
described as for administration.  A breakdown of this
$13,500,000, reflecting figures as set out in the Estate's
Form 706, is appended. (Exhibit 26).  KMZ's January 20, 1994
letter retainer agreement is also appended. (Exhibit 27).
Litigation (the Will contest, the 1917 Trust, the Heffner New
Jersey action, etc.) and other matters were to be -- and have
been -- billed separately from the $8,000,000 administration
charge.  Marshall negotiated the retainer with KMZ -- which
law firm had, advising Lafferty, brought U.S. Trust into the
picture -- and believes it to be reasonable, and states it is
certainly not so high as to be improper.

       When Duke retained KMZ in the Spring of 1993, that
firm's agreement with her called for billing (during her
lifetime) to be essentially on a time basis. (Exhibit 28).

       (6)  Miscellaneous Expenses. -- Miscellaneous
expenses have been incurred during the preliminary
administration that do not appear to be appropriately
classified as necessary maintenance items, to be expended by
those now charged only with the temporary administration of
the Estate's assets.  For example, a pistol firing range was
"reactivated" at Duke Farms in order that security personnel
there could appropriately hone their firearm skills.
Expense: $1,769.  Duke had had two camels at Duke Farms, one
of which died;  two miniature horses were purchased to
provide companionship for the remaining camel.  Expense:
$2,600.  Although Duke was an ardent conservationist, I am
informed that security needs after her death required that
trees on the Falcon's Lair property be cut down and cleared
away, and a new lighting system installed there at
considerable expense.

       Appended is a listing of some 90 work orders,
culled from records of many more, that were approved between
November 1993 and February 1995. (Exhibit 29).  A casual
reading of the list reflects, among other items, the apparent
approval of the purchase of eight further vehicles,
apparently for Duke Farms (items 3, 14, 15, 19, 39, 59, 76,
78), as well as a number of other items, approved by the
Estate's provisional administrators, the need for which may
be questioned.

E.   Concerning Honesty or Possible Dishonesty on the Part
  of Bernard Lafferty, U.S. Trust and Katten Muchin &
  Zavis (SCPA Section 707(i)(e), 711(2) and (8))           

       (1)  Sizable Pre-Death Gifts. -- A number of gifts
of Duke's funds were made in September-October 1993, at a
time when Duke admittedly was in poor physical condition and
in at least questionable mental shape.

       Duke's hospital chart (utilizing for Duke the name
"Norma Jane") reflects that on March 16, 1993 Lafferty signed
a bone marrow consent, stating as a reason "patient has
difficulty signing." (Exhibit 30).  An April 20, 1993 pre-
operative note states that Lafferty "will sign consent as
legal guardian" (Exhibit 31), possibly suggesting Duke's
diminished mental status at that point.  During September
1993, Duke had a series of physical therapy sessions with a
therapist who had worked with her months earlier; the
therapist stated that although Duke was "alert" in September
1993 there was "no comparison" with the level of her
alertness then with what it had been earlier.  This therapist
also noted at least two instances, in the course of four
therapy sessions, in which Duke was not clear; in one of
these instances, she was disoriented as to place, not knowing
that she was in California.  A number of therapeutic sessions
with Duke were canceled, apparently because of either her
physical condition or respiratory difficulties which
prevented the physical exertions involved in physical
therapy.  A respiratory therapist who treated Duke in
September-October 1993, both at Cedars-Sinai and at home,
stated that while at Cedars-Sinai, even before returning
home, Duke was approximately halfway between being fully
alert and comatose.

       Under date of September 27, 1993, in response to
interrogatories propounded by Heffner in her New Jersey suit,
the Duke verification was physically signed by Lafferty,
purportedly at the express request and direction of Duke and
in her presence; apparently, she was unable to sign, or even
to put her mark on the verification. (Exhibit 32).  As
Dr. Kivowitz, Duke's primary physician, testified at
deposition, on October 7, 1993 he viewed Duke as terminal, as
a hospice case, although he had not written this down.
(Exhibit 33).  Pearl Rosenstein, a nurse who had been with
Duke continuously from February of 1993 until the time of her
death, has stated that Duke was in and out of awareness from
late in her hospital stay, in September 1993; Duke was not
alert, did not communicate, generally her eyes were shut and
she may have been asleep.  Nurse Rosenstein further stated
that Duke was occasionally disoriented as to time and place
both at the hospital and after going home on September 20,
1993.  Prior to early October 1993 Duke's physical and mental
condition had apparently deteriorated significantly.  (See
appended Report of Dr. Macris, Exhibit 2, pp.7-8.)  The
medical reports of both Dr. Macris and Dr. Stephen Hyman
(Exhibits 2 and 4) indicate that as early as March 1993 --
seven months before a $500,000 gift was made to Dr. Glassman
-- the amounts and kinds of medication Duke was receiving
were such as to have affected her cognition.

       A February 23, 1995 letter from KMZ to me,
explaining unopened Duke mail from Summer into Fall 1993,
refers to the period "from July to October 1993 when she was
very ill." (Exhibit 34).

       Duke died October 28, 1993.

       Against this background, it is appropriate to
consider the significant gifts of her funds that were made in
September-October 1993, and whether in fact these were
actually gifts authorized by Duke, or whether they suggest
misapplication of her assets.

       In September 1993, a "loan" of $900,000 was made to
Dr. Rolando Atiga ("Dr. Atiga"), as reflected in Schedule C
of the U.S. Estate Tax Return, Form 706.  At the time,
Dr. Atiga's then prior quite substantial Duke loans (in
excess of $400,000) remained -- and remain -- unpaid.  By
check dated October 4, 1993, a $500,000 gift was made to
Dr. Glassman (Exhibit 35), also reflected in the U.S. Gift
Tax Return for 1993 (Exhibit 36).  As to this gift, Lafferty
states that Duke said "Dr. Glassman has always been good to
us all, I'm going to give him a gift."  On March 2, 1995,
Lafferty said that when he had spoken to George Reed ("Reed")
at the DBO, and instructed him to send a $500,000 check
payable to Dr. Glassman, Duke was listening on a
speakerphone.  When again interviewed by me a month later, on
April 13, 1995, Lafferty was told that the previous day
(April 12, 1995) Reed, who had kept contemporaneous notes
(Exhibit 37), had said he had not been told that Duke was on
a speakerphone, and knew nothing of such first-hand Duke
knowledge -- all his dealings having been with Lafferty and
Doyle -- Lafferty said maybe nothing had been said to Reed
about it.

       My inspection of Duke's U.S. Gift Tax Returns
(Forms 709) for calendar years 1990-92, reflects not a single
reported gift to any individual (non-charitable gift) during
any of those years.  The gift to Dr. Glassman, obviously, is
not in keeping with any Duke tradition.

       Under date of September 21, 1993, Dr. Kivowitz --
whose medical bills to Duke during the last months of her
life came to $50,000 monthly -- had received a $10,000 gift,
drawn on the DBO account. (Exhibit 38).

       Besides the non-charitable gifts to Dr. Glassman
and Dr. Kivowitz, the Estate's U.S. Gift Tax Return for
Calendar Year 1993, Form 709 (Exhibit 36), shows that a
number of charitable gifts were made in early October 1993
including $2,000,000 to Duke University, $1,000,000 to an
Elizabeth Taylor AIDS foundation, and $1,000,000 to People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, as well as in excess of
$10,700,000 to the pre-existing Doris Duke Foundation.  As to
these early October charitable gifts, Lafferty and Doyle
instructed Reed to cut the checks, purportedly on Duke's
instructions. (Exhibits 37 and 39).  On March 2, 1995,
Lafferty told me that letters had been prepared for Duke's
signature and transmitted by the DBO with the checks to Duke
for her to execute and forward.  A month later, when
interviewed on April 12, 1995, Reed said his files showed no
such letters.  The following day, on April 13, 1995, Lafferty
said he -- not Duke -- may have signed such letters, and his
earlier statement "may have been a mistake I made."  Covering
letters in fact were sent by Lafferty. (Exhibit 40).

       No documentation establishes that these various
gifts -- non-charitable and charitable -- were, in fact,
approved by Duke.  As noted, it is likely she was in such
condition in September-October 1993 that she well may have
been incapable of understandingly approving.  Lafferty had
extremely broad Duke Powers of Attorney under the laws of
California and New Jersey. (Exhibit 41).  But none of these
Powers specifically provided authority to make gifts, and
Lafferty did not claim to have acted pursuant to such powers
of attorney.

       Doyle stated he had not researched whether the
California Uniform Form Durable Power of Attorney Duke had
executed in Lafferty's favor implicitly included the power to
give gifts.  Research suggests it does not.

       Although Doyle and Lafferty stated the gifts to
Drs. Glassman and Kivowitz and to the various charities in
early October 1993 were pursuant to decisions made by Duke,
Reed (who signed each of the checks) stated unequivocally --
and his contemporaneously made early October 1993 notes
provide corroboration -- that he dealt only with Doyle and
Lafferty and had no reason to believe (other than what Doyle
or Lafferty may then have said) that Duke had requested or
authorized that these gifts be made.

       As to the $900,000 September loan to Dr. Atiga,
Doyle recognized the at best slight likelihood that it would
ever be repaid, but stated it had been discussed with Duke
and it was her desire that the "loan" be made.  Here, too,
Reed's recollection and notes, analogous to their early
October 1993 counterparts, reflect only Doyle's and
Lafferty's -- not Duke's -- directions. (Exhibit 42).

       (2)  Dr. Glassman's $500,000 Gift. -- As noted, the
U.S. Gift Tax Return for 1993 reflects an October 4, 1993
gift of $500,000 to Dr. Glassman.

       Dr. Glassman (according to the KMZ attorneys,
Lafferty, and apparently Dr. Kivowitz) introduced KMZ,
through its Los Angeles partner, Alan Croll, to Duke.  KMZ's
fees, as noted (item D-5 hereinabove), according to the
Form 706, are estimated to exceed $13,000,000 in this matter.
Lafferty, on the recommendation of KMZ, brought U.S. Trust in
as his co-fiduciary.  Its fees are anticipated to exceed
$5,000,000.

       Apart from introducing KMZ and Duke to each other,
it is undisputed that Dr. Glassman took Duke's hospital chart
from its place of safekeeping at Cedars-Sinai in or about
August 1993.  Shanley apparently overheard a reference to
Dr. Glassman's action, and Lafferty and Doyle confirm that
they became aware of it.  After Shanley reported it,
purportedly Dr. Glassman returned the chart intact, but there
is no way of verifying whether or not any items had been
removed from it. (It is speculated that it was taken to
remove items reflecting negatively on Duke's testamentary
capacity in March-April 1993.)

       (3)  Duke's Cremation. -- The death certificate
states that Duke died at 5:48 a.m. on October 28, 1993.
(Exhibit 43).  At the time of Duke's death, Doyle was present
at Falcon's Lair, as were Lafferty, nurses Rosenstein and
Payette, the Falcon's Lair staff and Nuku's sister.  Doyle
said that he had learned from Dr. Kivowitz that, on
October 7, 1993, he (Dr. Kivowitz) had discussed with Duke
that she was not recovering, and that he could do nothing for
her but keep her comfortable.  (No medical records -- nurses'
notes, etc. -- confirm such conversation with Duke on that
date or any other date.)  Dr. Kivowitz that day altered his
course of treatment, focusing on keeping Duke pain free and
comfortable.

       I am informed by the personnel of Pierce Brothers,
the mortuary establishment in Los Angeles that handled the
arrangements following Duke's death, that customarily
cremation follows death by four or five days; I am further
informed that Duke's cremation took place commencing at
4:17 a.m. on October 29, 1993 -- less than twenty-four hours
after death -- quite unusual, but not entirely unique,
swiftness.

       Because of realistic fears, including that Heffner
might, in some fashion, have interfered with Duke's desire to
have her Estate probated in New York County, arrangements
were made, through KMZ, to obtain the death certificate
promptly, on the day of death, Thursday, October 28th.  This
facilitated the quick cremation early Friday morning.

       This swift cremation precluded any possibility of
an autopsy or exhumation.

       The rush to cremation was also in part purportedly
occasioned by concern that Heffner may have wanted Duke's
body; Duke had not wanted Heffner anywhere near her body.
(My research suggests there may be some ambiguity, under
California law, whether Heffner, as Duke's daughter, would
have had a claim to the body, even though the Durable Power
of Attorney for Health Care, executed by Duke on April 16,
1993, gave Lafferty authority to make decisions concerning
the remains.)

       Doyle conceded that once the death certificate had
been secured (Thursday afternoon), the probate proceedings
could have moved ahead even though the body had not yet been
disposed of.  A proceeding was in fact instituted by the
Heffner attorneys in New Jersey, brought on by Order to Show
Cause of November 1, 1993, seeking to restrain KMZ and others
from seeking probate elsewhere than in the State of New
Jersey. (Exhibit 44).  By the time, however, that the New
Jersey Show Cause Order was served, preliminary letters had
issued in New York.

       The April 5, 1993 Will, drafted by KMZ, specified
Duke's desire that there be no funeral or memorial service,
and that she "be buried at sea."  This provision was
virtually identical to those contained in her earlier
November 4, 1991 and July 28, 1987 Wills, and had not been
changed by any of the intervening Codicils.  I have not been
informed of any contrary side letters or other contrary
written instructions.

       Doyle stated that in conference with Duke (at
Falcon's Lair in April 1993) Doyle informed Duke that
California law required cremation if human remains were to be
placed into the sea; that an uncremated body could not be
deposited into the sea under California law.  Having so
informed Duke, Doyle states that Duke expressed willingness
that her remains be cremated. (Doyle had had Michael
McCarthy, then a KMZ attorney, research California law
concerning "burial at sea" after Duke was admitted to the
Cedars-Sinai Intensive Care Unit on March 19, 1993.  Doyle
stated he did not think it necessary to research Hawaiian law
concerning burial at sea, and did not think it necessary to
advise Duke that California law would not apply to burial off
Hawaii.)

       Lafferty states that in conversations he had with
Duke she stated her desire to be cremated, these
conversations having taken place after Lafferty had learned
of his raise to $100,000 annually, during the summer of 1993.
Lafferty stated that Duke had further instructed him that she
wished her remains carried to each of her houses (Falcon's
Lair, Duke Farms, Rough Point, and Shangri-La), to spend one
night in each of these residences before the remains were
disposed of.  There appears to be accord that Duke wished her
remains brought to each of her homes, other than New York
City.  (Without judging the logic of this, and insofar as
this may make any sense at all, would it have made more sense
if the remains meant her body -- via the Duke 737 airplane --
rather than her ashes, so that domestics or neighboring
friends might, there being no funeral, pay respects?)  In
fact, the remains were not taken to Hawaii until November 14,
and disposed of there on November 17, 1993, after having been
taken to the various homes -- as indicated -- for one or more
nights.

       Others have informed me that Duke told them that,
after death, she wished to be "fed to the sharks," in no
fashion indicating any desire for cremation.

       As KMZ was continuing to prepare various further
documents for Duke's execution in both April 1993 and June
1993 (Exhibit 45), a writing might then have been readily
presented to Duke for execution specifying cremation.  This,
apparently, was not done.

       My inquiry suggests that Doyle misinformed Duke, in
that he focused attention solely on California burial law.
This, in fact, interprets "burial at sea" to include
cremation and does not speak of depositing a body into the
sea.  California Health and Safety Code Section 7117.  However,
there is agreement among Doyle, Lafferty, and others that
Duke wanted her remains -- whatever form they were in --
deposited in the sea across from Shangri-La, her home at
Diamond Head in Hawaii, not off the California coast.
Hawaiian law does not define "burial at sea," and my inquiry
of personnel of the Hawaii Department of Health confirmed
that either a body or cremated remains can be deposited in
the sea off Hawaii, outside the three nautical mile limit.
(Indeed, 40 C.F.R. Section 229 (1994) would permit the deposit
of a body, or cremated remains, three nautical miles off the
United States coast, off California or wherever.)  And so
cremation was not required to meet Duke's "burial at sea"
desire, and assuming the Doyle-Duke conversation took place
as Doyle told me of it, Doyle misled Duke.

       Apart from the oral statements of Doyle and
Lafferty, some uncertain support for the purported Duke
request for cremation was offered by two persons whom I
interviewed.  Eleanor Lawson -- who received a bequest of
$3,000,000 pursuant to the April 5, 1993 Will (a like bequest
having been provided for her by the March 13, 1991 Codicil to
the July 28, 1987 Will) -- equivocated concerning cremation.
When she met with me she was accompanied not only by her own
attorney, but by two KMZ partners as well, all three of whom
entered the conference room, in which I had been waiting,
together with Lawson.  Lawson stated that she had discussed
cremation with Duke over the years, that Duke believed in
cremation, and that she assumed that Duke's Will had
expressly provided for cremation.  Dr. Atiga, as already
noted a person very deeply in debt to Duke who had received a
$900,000 "loan" of Duke funds in September 1993 (after he had
received earlier substantial loans that remained unpaid), was
accompanied to the conference with me by two KMZ partners,
one of whom, during the conference, said he also served as
Dr. Atiga's lawyer.  Dr. Atiga stated that Duke would say
interchangeably she "wants to be tossed in the ocean" and
"wants my ashes tossed in the ocean."

       In contrast with the Lawson and Atiga somewhat
tentative approaches to suggesting Duke may have wished
cremation, in conference with Fay and Virginia Wright, Duke's
two spiritual advisors -- sisters so close to Duke that they
were among the very few permitted to visit Duke both at
Cedars-Sinai and at Falcon's Lair shortly prior to her death,
and persons whose religious mission received annual gifts as
well as a sizable bequest under the April 5, 1993 Will --
they stated that they had not discussed cremation or burial
arrangements at any time with Duke, although they personally
believed in cremation.

       There had been extensive Duke discussions with
William Zabel of Schulte Roth & Zabel that led to the
drafting and execution of Duke's November 4, 1991 Will.  Duke
never discussed cremation with Zabel, and I am informed that
had she his practice would have been to document this request
in writing.

       (4)  Awareness of the April 16, 1992 Codicil. --
The May 2, 1994 Doyle affidavit -- executed more than a year
after the facts to which it referred -- in describing Doyle's
March 1993 contacts with Duke that led to the two KMZ
Codicils and then the April 5, 1993 Will, states (at para. 4)
that at KMZ's first meeting with Duke, on March 4, 1993 at
Cedars-Sinai, Duke gave Doyle "copies of her then current
Will [that of November 1991] and Codicil [that of April 16,
1992]," and further states that "she wished to make some
minor changes."  Thereafter, this 1994 affidavit refers again
to the "existing Will and Codicil."  This May 1994 reference
both to Duke's and Doyle's purported awareness, in March-
April 1993, of the April 16, 1992 Codicil appears to conflict
with documents prepared by Doyle and his KMZ colleagues in
March and April 1993.

       The March 8, 1993 Codicil, the first Codicil
prepared by KMZ, makes no express reference to the April 16,
1992 Codicil (which had been prepared by a partner of Samuel
Greenspoon, Esq., who had long served as Duke's legal
advisor) ("the Greenspoon Codicil"), or to expressly revoking
that particular Codicil.  This first KMZ Codicil simply
states that it (the March 8, 1993 testamentary instrument) is
a Codicil to the November 4, 1991 Will, further providing
generally for the revocation of "any other Will made by me
and any codicil made to my Will."  A memorandum, under date
of March 9, 1993, dictated by Alan Croll and Doyle concerning
execution of the March 8, 1993 Codicil and events leading up
to it (Exhibit 46), makes no reference to the Greenspoon
Codicil.  (For security's sake, KMZ used the name "Mary
Newport" for Duke.)  The memorandum refers to Doyle's showing
Duke the provisions in the November 1991 Will (as if this was
all the first KMZ Codicil was changing).  It contrasts the
fees to be given Lafferty pursuant to the first KMZ Codicil
with those given Irwin Bloom under the November 4, 1991 Will,
failing to note any discussion of the much lesser fees given
to Walker Inman and Lafferty, named as executors pursuant to
the April 1992 Codicil, which it ignores.

       A partial summary (2 pages only) was begun by
Doyle, under date of March 15, 1993, which refers to the
execution on March 14, 1993 of the second KMZ Codicil.
(Exhibit 47).  This also makes no reference to the Greenspoon
Codicil, and it denominates the March 14, 1993 KMZ document
as "a Second Codicil," referring to the earlier KMZ
testamentary document as "my `First Codicil'" to the 1991
Will.

       Under date of April 4, 1993, Doyle wrote a
memorandum to Duke analyzing how the new Will would
incorporate the November 4, 1991 Will and the two KMZ
Codicils. (Exhibit 48).  Once again, no mention is made
reflecting any knowledge of the Greenspoon Codicil.  A chart
appended to that memorandum contrasts the compensation
Lafferty would receive under the new Will with that of Irwin
Bloom under the November 1991 Will, again failing to take any
note of the Greenspoon Codicil and its relatively minimal
compensation provisions for Messrs. Lafferty and Inman as
Executors and Trustees.

       Thereafter, under date of April 5, 1993, a Doyle
memorandum (Exhibit 49) concerning the execution of the
April 5, 1993 Will states (at the top of its second page)
that he explained to Duke that the new Will "simply
incorporated all the provisions of her current Will [that of
November 4, 1991] and the March 8, 1993 and March 14, 1993
Codicils [both KMZ documents] into a single document."  Once
again, no mention is made of the Greenspoon Codicil.  Also
omitted is the fact that under the April 5, 1993 Will -- as
considered hereinafter at E 5 -- the trustees' prospective
fees may be massive compared to the limited commissions to
Inman and Lafferty, for performing duties as trustees, under
the April 16, 1992 Greenspoon Codicil.

       This history strongly suggests that in March-April
1993 Doyle -- and quite likely Duke -- were unaware of, or
did not call to mind, the April 16, 1992 Greenspoon Codicil,
despite Doyle's contrary affidavit of more than a year later,
May 2, 1994.

       When questioned concerning the absence of any
reference in these March-April 1993 documents to the
Greenspoon Codicil -- contrasted with the references in
Doyle's May 1994 affidavit -- Doyle insisted that he had in
fact received an unexecuted copy of the Greenspoon Codicil
from Duke at the hospital on March 4, 1993, and that he was
fully aware of its content when he prepared the various
Codicils and memoranda above referred to, but that he was
uncertain whether it was a valid instrument.  Moreover, he
stated that as the first KMZ Codicil revoked the prior
Greenspoon Codicil, there was no need to refer to it
thereafter.  Moreover, Doyle stated that the $250,000 limit
on the fees to be paid to the individual executors (pursuant
to the Greenspoon Codicil) was "outrageous," that he
discussed this with Duke, and that she agreed.

       No further explanation was proffered for the fact
that the KMZ documents overall rewarded Lafferty as
Executor/Trustee far more handsomely than had the Greenspoon
Codicil rewarded Lafferty and Inman, and why KMZ contrasted
the Lafferty fees as provided in the March-April 1993 KMZ
documents with those of Bloom as provided in the November 4,
1991 Will which fees had been rendered nugatory by the
Greenspoon Codicil.

       (5)  Trustees' Statutory Compensation. -- As noted,
in memoranda reporting information given to Duke in March-
April 1993, Doyle stressed changes from the November 4, 1991
Will, not contrasting the new testamentary documents with the
April 16, 1992 Greenspoon Codicil.  Further, pursuant to the
Greenspoon Codicil the maximum compensation of each Lafferty
and Inman, as trustees, was fixed at $250,000.  The
November 4, 1991 Will had provided that the charitable
foundations to be created under that Will were to be "in the
form of corporations or trusts, or a combination thereof"
(Article 9, para. A), further providing that each director or
trustee of such foundation was to "receive reasonable
compensation" (Article 9, para. C).

       The April 5, 1993 KMZ Will allows trustees'
compensation, not limited to $250,000 (as in the Greenspoon
Codicil) and not specified to be "reasonable compensation"
(as in the Zabel November 4, 1991 Will).  Rather, it allows
trustees' of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, which it
creates as a trust (see Article 8), compensation in the
amount of one-half of the commissions provided by law.  As
SCPA 2309(5)(a) provides commissions of 6% annually, under
the April 5, 1993 Will the trustees would be entitled to 3%.
If the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation is -- as is
anticipated -- to be in the billion dollar range, and to earn
income of at least 5% or $50,000,000 annually, 3% of this
could be something well in seven figures; moreover, two
trustees' commissions, not simply one, are allowable under
the statute.  The April 5, 1993 Will allows Lafferty to
apportion these commissions among the five (or more)
trustees, at least three of whom Lafferty is to designate.
(Article Eleven, para. B(5)).

       This suggests that contrasting the trustees'
commissions under the April 5, 1993 Will with the "reasonable
compensation" of the "directors or trustees" under the
November 4, 1991 Will demonstrates that far more than a
"minor change" has been made by KMZ.  But, the Doyle May 2,
1994 affidavit (at para. 4) spoke of "minor changes."
Furthermore, the Doyle memorandum of April 5, 1993, at pages
2-3, describes Doyle's explanation to Duke of fees and
commissions pursuant to the April 5, 1993 Will; it does not
contrast them, however, with the "reasonable compensation"
provision under the November 4, 1991 Will or the very
stringent limitation under the Greenspoon Codicil.

       (6)  Non-Reported Cash Salaries. -- While Duke was
alive, and continuing into the present, the DBO has paid
salaries -- which now come to approximately $40,000 to each
annually -- in cash, to two Duke employees, Cupie and Digi
Singh.  Indeed, within the last year an additional employee
has been taken on (at Duke's New York City apartment) also
paid in cash, off the books.  The immigration status of all
three employees appears to be illegal.  Immigration counsel
have now been employed by the preliminary executors, through
KMZ, to regularize the status of these employees, but in the
meanwhile they continue to be paid in cash, off the books.

       Query: Regardless of Duke's having herself ignored
this Zo Baird problem, what is the propriety of fiduciaries,
particularly in an estate of this size, having continued for
about a year and a half to pay salaries in cash off the
books?  This avoided withholding taxes and Social Security
payments and any report on income on which the employees
would be required to pay income taxes.  Despite their
irregular immigration status, the Singhs (and the new
employee) could have been paid on the books, with appropriate
fringe benefits, including Social Security, tax deductions,
etc.  The Internal Revenue Code Sections 3102(a), 3301(a) and
3402(a), and Reg. Section 31.6051-2, require employers to withhold
taxes and file W-2s.  That this would have made a record of
the employees' illegal immigration status -- which is now (I
am informed) being dealt with through counsel -- does not
excuse an employer's failure to pay Social Security, to
withhold taxes and to report the employees' tax obligation.

F.   Concerning Possible Conflicts of Interest on
  the Part of Bernard Lafferty, U.S. Trust and
  Katten Muchin & Zavis (SCPA Section 702(8))     

       (1)  Bank's Loan to Its Designating Fiduciary. --
As noted (A 1), between November 26, 1993 (less than a month
after Duke's death) and early January 1995, U.S. Trust
extended unsecured loans to Lafferty totalling $825,000.
(Exhibits 50).  Although Lafferty's personal financial
statement, filed with the bank, had shown a complete absence
of assets, he had an immense expectancy if either the
April 5, 1993 Will were to be admitted to probate or were he
to be allowed a commission, as preliminary executor, for his
services.  He is also given income of $500,000 annually under
the April 5, 1993 Will. (The earlier November 4, 1991 Will
had provided him with an annuity of approximately $100,000
annually for life.)

       Article Eleven, paragraph A(4) of the April 5, 1993
Will provided Lafferty with "absolute discretion to remove
the corporate Executor at any time," and to appoint a
different bank or trust company in its place.

       Lafferty states that no one raised with him the
issue of a possible conflict of interest in his borrowing so
substantially from his co-fiduciary, U.S. Trust.

       U.S. Trust's agreement with Lafferty (who had
designated it) for the bank to serve as co-fiduciary, assures
the bank of fees and commissions of in excess of five million
dollars (Exhibit 51), if the proffered Will is admitted to
probate.  Doyle had made the suggestion to Duke to include
U.S. Trust in the Will, and had suggested transferring Duke
assets and accounts to U.S. Trust.  Doyle states he had not
previously met Marshall, but had had telephone discussions
with him concerning matters having nothing to do with
Duke.

       In extending the first portion of the Lafferty
loan, namely a loan of $300,000, high U.S. Trust personnel
questioned whether this loan, "on an unsecured basis to a co-
executor, with no financials of his own, with terms which
would be much more favorable than to a regular client," would
be a conflict of interest. (Exhibit 52).  Ranking bank
personnel disagreed, and an oral opinion from outside counsel
was sought which, I was informed, expressed the view that
this would not constitute a conflict. (Exhibit 53).  As the
amount lent grew -- with an additional $200,000 on April 13,
1994, a further $200,000 on September 16, 1994, an additional
$95,000 on January 8, 1995 and a final $30,000 on October 31,
or January 11, 1995 -- U.S. Trust appeared not to have
sought to enforce (prior to January 1995) any restraints on
Lafferty's continued spending.

       Jeffrey Maurer, President of U.S. Trust, who
apparently personally approved of the loans to Lafferty, is
unaware of any concrete controls placed on Lafferty's
spending.  While recognizing that the Lafferty loan was given
the bank's lowest grade, he stated that traveling and living
with Duke, Lafferty had "acquired certain tastes which
altered the lifestyle to which he previously had been
accustomed," and it is customary for the bank to lend money
to people to enable them to maintain lifestyles when, as
fiduciaries, they will be able to repay these lent funds.  In
Lafferty's case, Maurer is satisfied the loans were not
unreasonable when viewed in comparison with Lafferty's
expected fees.  U.S. Trust believes that, on a quantum meruit
basis, Lafferty had earned at least one-third of his
executor's commission, or $1.65 million.  This being so, the
loan totalling half of that amount -- mainly $825,000 -- the
bank believes is fully secured.

       Query: Does the conjuncture of these facts --
Lafferty's power of life or death over U.S. Trust with regard
to the Estate, the bank's fee expectancy in this matter of in
excess of $5,000,000 and the bank's acts of lending Lafferty
money from time to time, ultimately totalling $825,000 in
just over thirteen months -- put both Lafferty and U.S.
Trust, as fiduciaries, in conflicted positions?

       (2)  Double Dipping? -- Following Duke's death,
Lafferty has continued to live -- essentially expense free --
in Duke's homes, a somewhat unusual bonus for an estate's
fiduciary.  If the April 5, 1993 Will is admitted to probate
he will be entitled to a lifetime annuity, executor's
commissions and trustee's fees.  The DBO, advised by KMZ and
U.S. Trust, continues to pay Lafferty a salary of $100,000 a
year, the amount to which Duke had -- at the time of
consultations with KMZ attorneys in mid-1993 -- raised his
compensation as her Executive Assistant.  Recognizing that
ultimately this payment might be found to be vulnerable, it
is being continued with the understanding that upon an
accounting by the fiduciaries, it would be repaid were the
Surrogate to so require.

       (3)  Bank's Reporting a Duke-Lafferty Death-bed
Gift. -- The United States Gift Tax Return for Calendar Year
1993, Form 709, prepared and executed by U.S. Trust -- apart
from the Glassman and charitable gifts already considered
(item E-1, supra) -- reflects a $56,582.92 gift to Lafferty
under date of October 27, 1993, the day before Duke's death.
(Exhibit 36).  I am informed that this is the amount of
Lafferty's personal credit card charges incurred before
Duke's death that had remained unpaid at the time of her
death.  As Duke had, apparently, paid Lafferty's personal
credit card charges while she was alive and functioning --
his charges, apparently, having, until her last weeks, been
quite chary -- (and I am informed had done the same for
Heffner during their active relationship), U.S. Trust
determined to record this open item as a Duke gift, and it
was paid by the DBO.  (I failed to inquire, and was not
informed, how this past Duke generosity had been handled, or
reported, tax-wise.)

       (4)  Complete Control Over Duke Assets. -- Between
March and June of 1993, KMZ prepared and supervised Duke's
execution of at least two dozen documents (Exhibit 45) at a
time during and immediately following her hospitalization at
Cedars-Sinai, when she was in an at least questionable mental
state (item H-2, infra).  Several of these documents,
including the March 8, 1993 Codicil, were executed only four
days after KMZ's initial contact with Duke.  The documents
prepared by KMZ during this period include Powers of Attorney
exercisable in California and in New Jersey (Exhibit 41),
Durable Powers of Attorneys for Health Care and other health
care proxies (Exhibits 18 and 54), and instructions
(unsigned) to all Duke managers to take direction from
Lafferty (Exhibit 55).  The totality of these documents
delegated to Lafferty essentially unfettered control over
Duke's assets, homes, staff and medical treatment during her
life and, ultimately, over her remains and her Estate.

       The broad control granted to Lafferty contrasts
with the more limited powers enjoyed by designees pursuant to
Duke's prior instruments, instruments prepared by her
previous attorneys each of whom had enjoyed a more extensive
relationship with Duke than had KMZ in the early Spring of
1993.  For example, Duke had had numerous meetings and
correspondence with William Zabel, Esq., concerning her
estate planning since July 1991, culminating in the execution
of her November 4, 1991 Will.  Yet she explicitly instructed
him not to release the Powers of Attorney she had executed on
November 4, 1991 in favor of Irwin Bloom, her long-time
accountant. (Exhibit 56).  Similarly, the Durable Medical
Powers of Attorney in favor of Lafferty prepared by Susan
Walker, Esq. -- who had then represented Duke for over a year
-- were not exercisable unless Duke could not communicate her
desires, or was mentally incapacitated. (Exhibit 19).
Indeed, the April 6, 1992 Power required Lafferty to consult
with Dr. Atiga "in all matters pertinent to [Duke's] medical
care, including [her] mental competency and judgment," the
January 19, 1993 Power similarly requiring Lafferty to
consult with both Drs. Atiga and Kivowitz.  No such
restrictions were placed on Lafferty's ability to immediately
exercise the powers granted under the instruments prepared by
KMZ.

       The breadth of the powers given Lafferty under
these documents -- particularly when contrasted with earlier,
far more limited delegations -- suggest that KMZ, which was
to receive sizable legal fees, used its position (and
possibly Duke's illnesses) to utilize that massive power that
it had, through Duke, placed under the control of Lafferty.
Given Lafferty's dependence on persons -- including KMZ's
Doyle and others -- more sophisticated than he, KMZ thus
effectively delegated to itself much control over Duke's
affairs.

G.   Concerning Possible Failures by the Fiduciaries,
  Bernard Lafferty and U.S. Trust, and their Counsel,
  Katten Muchin & Zavis, to Bring Appropriate
  Proceedings (SCPA Section 702(9))                     

       (1)  Reclaiming Gifts. -- As noted, the 1993 U.S.
Gift Tax Return (Form 709) reflects a gift to Dr. Glassman,
on October 4, 1993, of $500,000. (Exhibit 36).  The Form 706
reflects a "loan" of $900,000 to Dr. Atiga, dated
September 10, 1993, which loan (history shows) has virtually
no likelihood of repayment.  Form 709 also reflects
charitable gifts: on October 3, 1993 of $1,000,000 to the
Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation, on October 5, 1993 of
$10,724,000 to the Doris Duke Foundation (a foundation
created by Duke during her life), on October 5, 1993 of
$1,000,000 to People for Ethical Treatment of Animals, and on
October 5, 1993 of $2,000,000 to Duke University.

       These gifts were made, as noted, at a time when
Duke's own ability to consciously and intentionally authorize
them was at least dubious. (Item E-1, supra).  I have seen no
documentation demonstrating Duke's knowledgeable
authorization of these gifts.  And, as Reed's notes and
recollection reflect, his instructions in each instance as
the maker of each of the checks were from Doyle and Lafferty,
not from Duke.  As the residuary beneficiary of the Estate is
a new foundation, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, if
these death-bed gifts were not properly authorized, possibly
the preliminary executors should have instituted proceedings
to recover these amounts.

       (I recognize that it is unrealistic to have
expected the preliminary executors to have brought such
actions, but SCPA Section 702(8) and (9) provide a mechanism for
such suits.)

H.   Considering Whether Bernard Lafferty, U.S. Trust and
  Katten Muchin & Zavis May Be Otherwise Unfit for the
  Execution of their Office (SCPA Section 707(1)(e), 711(8);
  SCPA Section 702(10))                                   

       Questions of undue influence and lack of
testamentary capacity are issues to be explored if and when
formal objections are filed to the probate of the April 5,
1993 Will.  However, at the January 20, 1995 conference at
which I was designated, and at conferences thereafter
attended by all counsel, Your Honor noted not only that you
had not intended to restrict my authority, but when specific
inquiry was made (on January 20, 1995) as to my role in
inquiring concerning the so-called "murder allegations,"
according to a Lee Ann Watson memorandum, "Preminger noted
that although it may be out of her province to prosecute a
murder allegation to the extent there is any evidence of a
murder that might be `euphemistically speaking, proof of
undue influence'" (January 21, 1995, Watson memorandum,
appended to her March 13, 1995 Affidavit).

       Therefore, in terms of reporting whether Lafferty,
U.S. Trust or KMZ might be "otherwise unfit for the execution
of the office" that they are now (in preliminary fashion)
filling, some fact report of what I learned -- in the course
of my broader inquiry -- concerning Duke's death, and
concerning the execution of the April 5, 1993 Will, seems
appropriate.

       (1)  Duke's Death. -- With the Court's permission
to employ such investigators or others as I deemed necessary,
I retained the services of Dr. Nicholas T. Macris, whose
report of April 11, 1995 and curriculum vitae, are appended
hereto. (Exhibit 2).  As that report notes, I supplied
Dr. Macris with all the medical information, including
hospital records and nurses' notes, that I obtained through
KMZ; I informed Dr. Macris of the nature of my assignment and
my lack of any preconception, and requested that he
objectively evaluate the information with which I supplied
him, and that he prepare a written report reflecting his
analysis.  He has done so.  The report speaks for itself.

       Although Dr. Macris notes that by September-October
1993 it was clear that Duke's illness was terminal, he
further notes that Dr. Kivowitz' actions in "increasing the
morphine to a dosage level" was such that it would "stop Ms.
Duke's breathing and cause her death."  Further, he states
that the cause of death as reflected in the death certificate
executed by Dr. Trabulus remains unsupported by the medical
documentation.

       On October 25, 1993, following a meeting between
Lafferty and Dr. Kivowitz, Dr. Kivowitz told Duke's
respiratory therapist -- who was then in the midst of
administering treatment -- to stop treatment, explaining that
Duke had a urinary tract infection (apparently not uncommon
among seriously ill elderly persons), and that further
respiratory treatments would be discontinued.

       Colm Kennedy, who was in charge of Duke's
private 737 airplane, made a diary entry on October 25, 1993
that Lafferty called and asked if the plane would be ready,
although Duke was then bedridden, heavily sedated and being
administered hospice care.

       Duke's death was clearly anticipated by Wednesday
evening October 27, 1993.  On that day, as reflected in a
note in Pierce Brothers' (mortuary) file, Dr. Glassman had
contacted the mortuary (Exhibit 58).  And the afternoon
nurses (3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.), I am told, had been asked
by Dr. Kivowitz to be prepared to stay on, and were told to
cancel the night nurses, who ordinarily came on duty at
Falcon's Lair form 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.  Moreover, in his
deposition transcript, at page 911 (Exhibit 59), Dr. Kivowitz
stated:

       I increased the morphine so that she would not
       linger, that she would not suffer, and
       ultimately that she would die perhaps shortly
       or sooner than she would have otherwise died
       from her medical conditions, which I judged
       within a 48-hour period were of a terminal
       nature.

       Reviewing the nurses' notes from October 23 through
October 28, 1993, nurse Rosenstein could find no indication
that Duke was in any pain, was agitated or restless.  She had
no explanation of why Duke had been given morphine or why the
morphine dosage was increased (Exhibit 60), and why there was
a morphine push (Exhibit 61).  At the time Duke had a bad
heart and poor respiration; the increased morphine dosages
would -- and did -- decrease respiration.  Duke expired, as
noted, at 5:48 a.m. on Thursday, October 28, 1993.

       Following Duke's death, KMZ personnel and Lafferty
flew east over the weekend of October 30-31, 1993, finalized
and executed necessary documentation, and filed the Petition
for Probate in this Court on Monday morning, November 1,
1993.  Had Duke not expired when she did, the advantage of
the intervening weekend -- and the time it afforded to
complete all documentation -- might have been lost, and with
it possibly the ability for a Monday morning filing before
Heffner could interfere.

       (2)  Duke's Mental Clarity. -- In considering undue
influence or possible lack of testamentary capacity in March-
April 1993, I respectfully refer the Court to the April 11,
1995 report of Dr. Macris (Exhibit 2), which states that the
medications that Duke was taking at Cedars-Sinai from the
date of her admission in February 1993 through and subsequent
to the execution of the April 5, 1993 Will, were such that
they "may effect mental acuity," as could her "ongoing
chronic illness."  I also refer to the report, received by me
under date of February 24, 1995, from Dr. Steven E. Hyman,
Professor at the Harvard Medical School, which is appended
along with his covering letter and his curriculum vitae.
(Exhibit 4).  (In this connection, I note that initially Dr.
Hyman had been retained by Alan Fuchsberg, Esq. and Marie
Lambert, Esq., then counsel for Irwin Bloom.  Without
denigrating Dr. Hyman, I further note that, unlike
Dr. Macris, he did not initially come into this matter as a
neutral expert.  A preliminary report of Dr. Hyman was among
the documents, submitted on behalf of Irwin Bloom, which I
received soon after my designation.  I contacted Dr. Hyman
who informed me that his report had been updated and, at no
fee, he was kind enough to send me a copy of the updated
report.)

       As noted in the execution memorandum concerning the
March 8, 1993 Codicil (Exhibit 46), Doyle stated that Duke --
in the presence of the codicil's witnesses -- did nothing
other than nod her head and/or say "yes" to questions posed.
Although he thought it desirable to bring in Susan Walker,
Esq., from Hawaii, and other witnesses who knew Duke, he did
not see the need to encourage some conversation on her part,
in the presence of the witnesses, to demonstrate fully her
alertness and awareness.

       Nurse Rosenstein first met Duke in April 1992 after
Duke broke her hip.  From Duke's Cedars-Sinai hospitalization
in late February 1993, through Duke's death on October 28,
1993, nurse Rosenstein continuously served the afternoon
shift, without days off.  She states that in the Spring of
1993, although Duke was in poor medical condition,
malnourished, anemic, dehydrated, fragile and weak (unable to
turn in bed by herself or walk), she was alert and oriented,
and that she was also alert and mentally capable of doing
business at Duke Farms, New Jersey, in June 1993.

       Nurse Rose Mary Souza worked for Duke for several
months after Duke's discharge from Cedars-Sinai in April
1993.  She noted that, even that early, Duke suffered
intermittent bouts of confusion.  At times this confusion
would persist, at other times, it was short-lived.

       In June 1993, Duke met at Falcon's Lair with
personnel of Chemical Bank who had requested the meeting to
discuss that bank's having been, essentially, discharged,
U.S. Trust being substituted for it on most of Duke's funds
and assets.  It is undisputed that Nuku and other domestics
dressed Duke for that meeting, physically carried her
upstairs from her bedroom to the living room, and essentially
during the meeting -- which lasted no more than fifteen
minutes and was attended by Lafferty, Doyle and Chemical Bank
personnel -- Duke said nothing other than "yes" and "no" and,
at one point "corroborated."  Bank personnel, who did not
draw her into conversation, stated that she appeared to be
normal.

       I have been in contact with Susan P. Walker, Esq.,
who had done some legal work in Hawaii for Duke.  Walker made
available to me three file memoranda, two of March 19, 1992
and one of April 3, 1992 (Exhibit 62), as well as other
consistent documents.  These documents clearly reflect
directions that Ms. Walker told me she had received orally
from Duke on March 17, 1992: to prepare a new testamentary
instrument in which Lafferty was to be named executor and
trustee of the various Duke trusts.  Walker further stated
that although these instructions were unequivocal, she
informed Duke that her firm was not highly sophisticated in
the trusts and estates area and recommended that Duke employ
such attorneys.  Ultimately Walker did not prepare a
testamentary document that was executed.

       It is virtually undisputed, premised on the
statements of persons with knowledge whom I interviewed, that
as of 1993 the Duke-Lafferty relationship appeared to be a
loving one on the part of both, akin to a tender and devoted
mother-son relationship.

Miscellaneous Observations

       Since my designation on January 20, 1995, I have
read through a number of linear feet of documents, including
testamentary documents, litigation papers, medical reports
(including nurses' notes), memoranda and correspondence.  I
have also conducted face-to-face interviews with more than
fifty persons, both in the New York area (including New
Jersey) and the Los Angeles area, such persons essentially
being those who dealt with Duke toward the end of her life,
as well as attorneys both for the preliminary executors and
for those who may seek to contest admission to probate of the
April 5, 1993 Will, or who have some other professional
interest in this Estate.  Further, I have interviewed an
additional half dozen less critical persons by telephone.

       I must express my disappointment that my efforts,
through their counsel, to arrange face-to-face interviews
with Drs. Kivowitz and Glassman, either in Los Angeles or New
York, have proven unsuccessful.  KMZ personnel, acting for
the preliminary executors in refusing to waive
confidentiality agreements, blocked me from access to either
Chandi Heffner or her attorneys, and from two former
security persons at Duke Farms (Peter Wilczek and Frank
Senerchio), each of whom I was led to believe may have had
pertinent information.  A few relatively minor players were
also unavailable.

       The interviews I conducted were informal, not under
oath, and -- for the most part -- the persons interviewed
were not accompanied by counsel.  Personnel of the
preliminary executors and of the DBO and other Duke employees
were accompanied by KMZ counsel, and several of them by other
counsel as well, also employed by the preliminary executors.
Of Duke's three nurses whom I interviewed, counsel for two
were retained by the Estate; counsel for the third was
retained by Dr. Harry Demopoulos.  Lawson and Dr. Atiga, as
noted, were interviewed in the presence of KMZ attorneys,
with Lawson also having her own attorney present.  Walker
Inman and Dr. Demopoulos each were attended by their own
attorneys.

       Although I make no apologies for this Report, I
note that the time pressures of conducting the interviews,
absorbing all the information that I have learned, and
writing the Report have been considerable.  While I hope that
I have not missed critical information, this Report might
have been more complete had time permitted visits to the two
Duke homes I did not visit, Rough Point (Newport, Rhode
Island) and Shangri-La (Honolulu, Hawaii), and had there been
interviews there with further Duke employees and Duke
friends.  Still other persons in the New York and Los Angeles
areas, too, might have been interviewed.

       The Court has honored me through this designation
as limited temporary administrator, and I deeply appreciate
the Surrogate's confidence inherent in that appointment.


Dated: April 20, 1995              Respectfully submitted,

<P>John Gutfreund, the former head of Salomon Inc. securities brokerage firm, claims he was libeled by an article in the May 1, 1995 issue of Fortune magazine. The article entitled "Famous Failures -- Where They Are Now," mentions a Treasury bond trading scandal and says that Gutfreund has been "barred from the securities business for life." Gutfreund contends that he has never been barred from the industry and that this article hinders his ability to attract clients. This is his complaint against Time Inc., the publisher of Fortune.</P>

SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
COUNTY OF NEW YORK

--------------------------------X
                                :
JOHN H. GUTFREUND,              :  Index No. 95-109669
          Plaintiff,            :
                                :
    -against-                   :  Complaint

TIME INC.,                      :
          Defendant.            :
                                :
--------------------------------X

         Plaintiff John H. Gutfreund, by his attorneys,
Howard, Darby & Levin, for his Complaint alleges as follows:

         1.   This is an action for defamation and libel.

         2.   Plaintiff John Gutfreund is the former
Chairman of Salomon Inc., a worldwide securities firm.  He now
works as an adviser in international securities and financial
transactions.

         3.   Fortune magazine is a biweekly publication of
Defendant Time Inc. Fortune is one of the preeminent
business publications in the United States and around the
world.  It has a circulation of about 860,000 copies.
Fortune describes itself as "the world's premier global
management magazine" that "draws the world's most successful
business people into every issue."  The principal place of
business of defendant Time Inc. is New York City.

         4.   The May 1, 1995 issue of Fortune, in a box
prominently displayed on page 54 as part of the cover story,
states that John Gutfreund has been "barred from the
securities business for life."  The statement is false: John
Gutfreund has never been barred or suspended from the
securities business, not even for one day.

         5.   The Fortune statement is libelous per se.  The
false and defamatory statement gravely injures plaintiff's
reputation and severely impairs his ability to retain and
attract clients.

         6.   The Fortune article, entitled "Famous Failures
-- Where They Are Now," concludes that Mr. Gutfreund has "no
chance" for a comeback.  Fortune's publication of the false
statement asserting a non-existent "bar from the securities
business," and all that it implies to the world's business
leaders reading Fortune, goes far to ensure the result that
Fortune confidently predicts.

                        Background

         7.   John Gutfreund began his career at Salomon
Brothers in 1953, immediately after leaving military service
in the Korean War, and worked there for 38 years.  He was
Chairman of Salomon Brothers from 1978 until August 1991.

         8.   In August 1991, John Gutfreund resigned from
Salomon amid wild public speculation over the possible
involvement of Salomon's senior management in a series of
fictitious bids by a Salomon managing director, Paul Mozer,
in government Treasury auctions.  In fact, as later found and
publicly announced by the SEC, Mr. Gutfreund was not involved
and did not acquiesce in Mozer's scheme.

         9.   The facts behind Mr. Gutfreund's resignation
are largely a matter of public record.  In late April, 1991,
John Gutfreund received a report from three of Salomon's most
senior officers, including Salomon's chief legal counsel,
that Mozer had come forward and admitted to submitting one
fictitious bid in a Treasury auction two months earlier.  In
this report to Mr. Gutfreund, the incident was explained as
an aberrational act, committed in the heat of the auction,
without personal benefit to Mozer or monetary injury to the
Treasury.

         10.  Salomon's chief legal counsel told Mr.
Gutfreund that there was no legal duty to report the
incident, but it was decided that, as a matter of good
business relations with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
Mr. Gutfreund and another senior officer would tell the
Federal Reserve of Mozer's unauthorized bid.

         11.  Several weeks later, before the report was
made, another incident occurred involving the government bond
desk.  Salomon began an internal investigation into that
incident, hiring a respected law firm, Wachtell, Lipton,
Rosen & Katz, to conduct the inquiry.  In this investigation,
Salomon discovered that Mozer had lied to the executives when
he said that the earlier unauthorized bid was an aberration.
Mozer had, in fact, submitted seven fictitious bids between
July, 1990 and February, 1991.  Mozer's motivation was
apparently not monetary self-interest, but an egotistical
effort to subvert Treasury bidding guidelines he disagreed
with.

         12.  On August 9, 1991, before its investigation
was complete, Salomon voluntarily reported all that it then
knew to government authorities and made a public disclosure
announcing Mozer's bids.  Immediately upon Salomon's
announcement, the press began speculating that John Gutfreund
must have approved Mozer's bidding violations, because,
according to Wall Street myth, he "oversee[s] all trading
activity."  The rumors of management involvement appeared to
be confirmed by the fact, disclosed by Salomon, that Mozer
had admitted to a single false bid some three months earlier.
Speculation that "management knew" quickly drowned out the
fact that it was Salomon's management that had uncovered
Mozer's scheme and voluntarily disclosed it.

         13.  Federal officials, embarrassed that Mozer's
bidding scheme had evaded regulatory detection, fostered this
sinister view of "management involvement" by falsely
suggesting that Salomon had disclosed Mozer's scheme only
because it was about to be "caught" by federal regulators.
In fact, at the time, the government had no clue that Mozer
had submitted any fictitious bids.  One high Treasury
official later described these false suggestions as "damage
control" to try to "spin things our way" and divert attention
away from why the government itself hadn't detected Mozer's
unauthorized bids: "[W]e were concerned we were going to be
accused of being asleep at the switch."

         14.  As the false rumors spiralled out of control,
John Gutfreund decided to resign in an effort to prevent a
potentially debilitating loss of confidence in Salomon, the
8,000-employee firm to which he had devoted his entire 38-
year professional life.  Salomon's principal outside counsel,
Martin Lipton, strongly counseled against such resignation
since, based on his firm's extensive investigation, Mr.
Gutfreund had done nothing wrong.  Nonetheless, on Friday,
August 16, Mr. Gutfreund announced that he would offer his
resignation.  At a board meeting on August 18, 1991, John
Gutfreund resigned from the firm.

         15.  Instead of ending the matter, John Gutfreund's
resignation only added fuel to the fire of speculation.  It
was as if his act of self-sacrifice were confirmation that he
had engaged in wrongdoing. Why else, everyone seemed to
assume, would such a prominent executive resign?  Several
weeks later, during a congressional hearing, a Congressman
suggested that Mr. Gutfreund and the other top executives
should be in "striped suits sweeping the streets."  The
following day, Salomon's board, under enormous pressure to
distance itself from prior management, cut all links and
compensation to Mr. Gutfreund, including his previously
accrued pension and other benefits.  For a period, Salomon
even cut off medical benefits to Mr. Gutfreund's family in
violation of federal law.

              SEC Findings and Settlement

         16.  The shameful vilification of John Gutfreund
and other senior Salomon executives, judged guilty before the
SEC investigation even began, was proved baseless when the
SEC investigation concluded more than a year later.

         17.  In May 1992, Salomon avoided indictment for
Mozer's pattern of misconduct by agreeing in a settlement
with the SEC and the Department of Justice to pay $290
million in fines and restitution.  The government complaint
contained no allegation of any willful misconduct by Mr.
Gutfreund.  Salomon in its submissions concluded to the SEC
that the former executives were "at most negligent but
certainly not reckless" to have believed that Mozer's act was
an aberration.

         18.  In December 1992 -- at the end of a 15-month
investigation -- the SEC settled with John Gutfreund and the
other executives.  The SEC found no evidence that John
Gutfreund or the other senior executives had done anything
intentionally wrong.  Nor did the SEC find that John
Gutfreund and the other executives had broken any SEC rule.
Instead, the SEC issued a report finding that Mr. Gutfreund
and two other senior executives had "failed reasonably to
supervise" Mozer.  As to John Gutfreund, the SEC concluded
that "[a]s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Salomon,
Gutfreund bore ultimate responsibility" for assuring that
Mozer was adequately supervised.

         19.  The actual terms of SEC's public settlement
with John Gutfreund are a dramatic contrast to Fortune's
statement that John Gutfreund "was barred from the securities
business for life."  In addition to fines, the SEC had a
range of sanctions available to it, including:  i) public
censure; ii) suspension from the securities business; and,
iii) being barred from the securities business for life.  A
permanent bar is generally imposed only on individuals whom
the SEC finds committed criminal acts.  Individuals who have
been barred for life include Michael Milken, Ivan Boesky,
Dennis Levine and Martin Siegel.  The opprobrium associated
with a permanent bar from the securities business is well
understood in the industry.

         20.  In the SEC settlement in which, as Chief
Executive, he took "ultimate responsibility" for reasonable
supervision, John Gutfreund agreed to pay a fine of $100,000.
Mr. Gutfreund did not receive a public censure.  Contrary to
Fortune's assertion that he was "barred from the securities
business for life", John Gutfreund was not suspended from the
securities business, not even for one day.  Two Salomon
executives did receive short suspensions from the industry of
three and six months.  Mr. Gutfreund, however entered into an
undertaking of little practical effect to a man who was then
62 years old: he stated to the SEC that "he has no intention
of serving in the capacity of Chairman or Chief Executive
Officer" of a securities firm, and therefore undertook not to
become Chairman or CEO of such a firm unless he reapplied and
got the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

         21.  The SEC's Order was available publicly and
widely covered.  In a lead article the day after the
settlement, The New York Times headline reported that the
settlement was "A Low-Price Settlement."  The Wall Street
Journal reported that Mr. Gutfreund "won't head a securities
firm again without prior SEC approval."  These accurate
reports of the resolution of the SEC investigation were and
are fully available to Fortune at the touch of a button on
computerized databases.

                     Claim for Libel

         22.  Plaintiff John Gutfreund repeats and realleges
each of the allegations of paragraphs 1 to 21 above, as
though fully set forth herein.

         23.  The statement that John Gutfreund "was barred
from the securities business for life" is false.

         24.  The statement that John Gutfreund "was barred
from the securities business for life" constitutes libel per
se, for which damages are presumed.  John Gutfreund has also
suffered immediate and continuing injury to his reputation
and business as a result of Fortune's defamation.

         25.  Defendant published its assertion that Mr.
Gutfreund "was barred from the securities business for life"
either with knowledge of the statement's falsity or with
reckless disregard for the truth of the statement, the
standard for constitutional malice.  A finding of knowledge
or recklessness is unavoidable in view of the ready
availability to Fortune of the results of the SEC
investigation and of accurate accounts in the newspapers of
record that are readily available to Fortune through
computerized databases.

         WHEREFORE, Plaintiff John H. Gutfreund demands
damages in an amount to be calculated by the Court, including
an amount sufficient to purchase full-page retractions in
major business and general-interest newspapers and
periodicals worldwide.  Plaintiff also demands punitive
damages and such other relief as the Court may deem just and
proper.

OPINION OF THE COURT

GREENBERG, Circuit Judge.

                    The final judgments of sentence and
conviction from which the defendants appealed marked the
culmination of a decades-long rise and fall of an
electronics retail chain called Crazy Eddie and the family
that ran the company.  When all was said and done, the saga
involved: a New York-based chain which achieved enormous
success over the past few decades in large part due to the
company's aggressive advertising; an alleged behind the
scenes sophisticated family-run conspiracy to operate Crazy
Eddie in an unlawful manner, which allegedly netted the
defendants millions of dollars; a series of rancorous intra-
family disputes -- both business and personal -- which wound
up, tragically, in an in camera conference during the
criminal trial centering around whether a defendant's
presence at his daughter's funeral would be helpful or
hurtful to the family; the flight of a defendant to Israel
and his ultimate return to this country to stand trial; and
a lengthy high-profile criminal case resulting in a prison
term of more than ten years and a $121 million restitution
order against the best-known defendant.

       I.  Factual Background and Procedural History

                    The Crazy Eddie, Inc. chain of consumer
electronics stores began as a small operation in the 1970s
and in a fairly short time grew into a major New York area
consumer retail chain with stores in four states and with
reported annual sales totalling over $300 million.  Crazy
Eddie began as a family-controlled operation with Eddie
Antar as the key figure.  At the relevant times, Eddie was
the company's president and chairman of the board, though in
December 1986, he resigned as president.  Eddie's younger
brother Mitchell Antar worked for many years at Crazy Eddie
and then was appointed vice-president in charge of
purchasing and became a member of the board of directors in
May, 1984.  Mitchell subsequently became one of three
members of Crazy Eddie's "Office of the President."  On June
5, 1987, Mitchell resigned from all his positions at the
company, but did not divest himself of Crazy Eddie stock.

                    On September 13, 1984, Crazy Eddie
conducted an initial public offering ("IPO") of its stock.
Originally sold at $8 per share, by 1986 the stock was
trading at over $75 per share.  So by all appearances,
investors in Crazy Eddie had discovered a gold mine.
However, according to the indictment ultimately returned,
behind the scenes the defendants were manipulating the books
and falsifying financial statements which rendered the
optimistic appearances misleading.  The scheme allegedly
began between 1980 and 1983, when Eddie and other defendants
engaged in an unlawful practice called "cash skimming."
Cash skimming involves keeping certain cash receipts off the
books so that it can be put to tax-free personal use.  The
defendants soon decided to curtail the cash-skimming in
preparation for the IPO, because suddenly putting more
profits on the books would cause potential investors to
believe that the company experienced an exponential growth
in earnings.  In reality, though, by manipulating the
profits entered on the books, the defendants artificially
fostered a false appearance of growth.  These activities
resulted in the filing of a false financial statement with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

                    The indictment alleges that during the
next few years, Eddie directed employees to inflate year-end
inventory figures, and to falsify the company's books to
improve the financial information it would report to the
SEC.  This conduct enabled the defendants to conduct
successful second and third public offerings of stock.  The
various defendants allegedly committed other, similar
fraudulent acts during this time period.  By the end of
1986, the company had begun to lose money, but, the
government alleges, the defendants still continued to
fabricate Crazy Eddie's financial statements.  In May 1987,
Eddie attempted, through the initiation of a tender offer,
to buy back the company's shares and take it private.  In
June 1987, Elias Zinn of Entertainment Marketing, Inc.
launched a competing tender offer.  Eddie's tender offer
failed, and while Zinn withdrew his competing offer, he also
began a proxy fight in cooperation with the Oppenheimer-
Palmieri Fund to take over the board.  Their proxy fight
became successful on November 6, 1987.  After taking
control, Zinn and the Fund took a physical count of the
company's inventory, only to find that inventory valued on
its books at about $45 million was missing.

                    In August 1987, the SEC began an
investigation into the alleged fraud at Crazy Eddie.  The
indictment alleges that upon learning of this, Eddie and
others attempted to destroy damaging records to conceal the
extent of their fraud.  Ultimately, though, on September 6,
1989, the SEC filed a civil action in the United States
District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that
Eddie and several others on a number of occasions had
falsified Crazy Eddie's financial statements.  Upon motion
by the SEC, the district court preliminarily enjoined Eddie
from making any false statements in connection with
securities filings.  Additionally, the court ordered that:

                    [D]efendant Eddie
                    Antar shall transfer
                    all assets, funds or
                    other property
                    representing or
                    derived from the
                    $43,989,640.38
                    transferred to Bank
                    Leumi Israel on or
                    about February 17,
                    1987, or from the
                    funds in the
                    aggregate amount of
                    $8,367,325.25
                    transferred to Bank
                    Leumi Israel on or
                    about November 27,
                    1987, December 3,
                    1987, December 15,
                    1987, and January
                    21, 1987,
                    presently held in
                    foreign locations in
                    the name of Eddie
                    Antar, for his
                    benefit, under his
                    control or over
                    which he exercises
                    actual investment or
                    other authority, to
                    be held and invested
                    in accordance with
                    such instructions as
                    the Court may issue
                    upon notice to the
                    parties.

SEC v. Antar, No. 89-3773, January 24, 1990 Order at app.
1063 (the repatriation order).  Eddie failed to comply
with the order -- asserting his Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination -- even after the court granted
him extensions of time to comply.  Finally the court issued
an order to show cause why he should not be held in
contempt.  On February 9, 1990, the district court entered
an order finding that "Eddie Antar did not comply with the
Court's order for the transfer of assets" and that his
"failure to comply with the Court's order is willful and
contumacious."  App. 1065.  Thus, the court held him in
contempt, and ordered him incarcerated until he complied
with the repatriation order.  Eddie appeared before a
different district judge in order to purge the contempt, and
at that hearing agreed to appear before the court below on
February 27, 1990.  He did not appear on that date, and, as
it subsequently became known, he fled the country.

                    On April 6, 1990, the court ordered that
Eddie's answer to the SEC's complaint be stricken and four
days later it entered an order of default against him.  In
response to a motion by the SEC, the court on June 29, 1990
determined that "(1) Eddie Antar made illegal profits of
$52,519,548 from the sale of the stock of Crazy Eddie, Inc.
and is obligated to disgorge that amount; and (2) Eddie
Antar is liable for prejudgment interest in the amount of
$20,976,884."  App. 1051.  The SEC subsequently moved for
final judgment, and on July 6, 1990, the court entered final
judgment against him.  In that order, the court, among other
things, ordered him to "pay disgorgement in the amount of
$52,519,548 (which amount constitutes Eddie Antar's illegal
profits from the sale of the stock of Crazy Eddie, Inc. in
violation of the federal securities laws) to . . . the
trustee/receiver appointed by this court, to be distributed
pursuant to a plan of distribution proposed by the [SEC] and
approved by the court."  App. 1055-56.

                    On June 11, 1992, a federal grand jury
returned a multi-count indictment against Eddie Antar,
Mitchell Antar, Allen Antar and Eddie Gindi.  Count 1 of a
superseding indictment charged all the defendants with
conspiring to conduct or participate in the affairs of Crazy
Eddie through a pattern of racketeering activity in
violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1962(d), i.e., RICO conspiracy,
and alleged as predicate acts securities fraud and mail fraud
violations resulting from the falsification of Crazy Eddie's
books and the artificial inflation of the market price of
Crazy Eddie stock.  Counts 2 through 4 charged all the
defendants with causing false and misleading statements to
be made in documents Crazy Eddie filed with the SEC, in
violation of 15 U.S.C. Sections 78m and 78ff(a).  Count 5
charged the defendants with mail fraud, in violation of 18
U.S.C. Section 1341, for mailing a false SEC filing to a
shareholder. Counts 6 through 16 charged Eddie with
substantive securities fraud arising from the sale of stock, in
violation of 15 U.S.C. Sections 78j(b) and 78ff(a) and 17
C.F.R. Section 240.10b-5.  Counts 17 and 18 charged Mitchell
with similar substantive securities fraud violations.  Count
19 charged all the defendants with conspiring to commit
securities fraud and mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C.
Section 371.

                    When the indictment was filed, Eddie's
whereabouts were unknown, but in June 1992, he was arrested
in Israel.  After several proceedings in that country, Eddie
waived extradition, and voluntarily returned to this country
to stand trial.

                    All four defendants initially pleaded
not guilty, but Gindi's case was severed and he became a
government witness at trial.  The case against Eddie,
Mitchell and Allen Antar began on June 15, 1993.  After 19
days of trial, the case was submitted to the jury on July
15, 1993.  Five days later the jury returned its verdict.
It convicted Eddie on all counts against him and convicted
Mitchell on counts 1 through 5 and 19, but acquitted him on
counts 17 and 18.  The jury acquitted Allen on all counts.

                    On March 22 and 23, 1994, the district
court held a sentencing hearing.  On April 29, it sentenced
Eddie to 151 months in prison and ordered him to pay $121
million in restitution.  The court sentenced Mitchell to 51
months in prison and ordered him to pay $3 million in
restitution.  Eddie and Mitchell timely filed notices of
appeal, challenging both their convictions and their
sentences.  We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section
1291 and 18 U.S.C. Section 3742.  The district court had
jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 3231.

                        II.  Analysis

                     A.  Duty to Recuse

                    The appellants argue that the district
court should have disqualified itself sua sponte pursuant to
28 U.S.C. Section 455.  In response, the government, relying on
the failure of the appellants to make a recusal motion in
the district court, contends that the argument is untimely
and that we should not consider it.  However, our precedent
clearly establishes that under this statutory provision,
which contains no explicit timeliness requirement, even when
such motions are not made in the district court, we can
exercise review over a district judge's failure to recuse.
The standard of review does, though, change.  Thus, "where
no objection to the district court's failure to recuse was
made at trial, a plain error standard of review applies."
United States v. Dalfonso, 707 F.2d 757, 760 (3d Cir. 1983)
(citing United States v. Schreiber, 599 F.2d 534 (3d Cir.),
cert. denied, 444 U.S. 843, 100 S.Ct. 86 (1979)).  The plain
error doctrine derives from Federal Rule of Criminal
Procedure 52(b) which provides that "[p]lain errors or
defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although
they were not brought to the attention of the court."

                    When a party makes a recusal motion at
trial, a district court's failure to recuse is reviewed for
abuse of discretion.  A conviction may be reversed under the
plain error doctrine only when "[t]here [was] an 'error'
that is 'plain' and that 'affect[s] substantial rights.'"
United States v. Olano,     U.S.     ,     , 113 S.Ct. 1770,
1776 (1993) (first alteration added).  "Moreover, Rule 52(b)
leaves the decision to correct the forfeited error within
the sound discretion of the Court of Appeals and the court
should not exercise that discretion unless the error
'"seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public
reputation of judicial proceedings."'"  Id. (citations
omitted) (alteration in original).

                    The appellants' allegations of bias
derive in large part from a colloquy that occurred between
the United States Attorney and the district court at the
sentencing hearing, when the district court was considering
the amount of restitution to award.  We quote the passage at
length, with all its surrounding context:

                    MR. CHERTOFF:
                    Finally, your Honor,
                    in connection with
                    the Court's
                    observation about
                    the fact that the
                    public is to be the
                    beneficiary of this,
                    I'd like to suggest
                    to the Court that in
                    ordering restitution
                    the Court define the
                    appropriate class of
                    victims to receive
                    the restitution,
                    which I think would
                    be those who on a
                    net -- those
                    investors, other
                    than co-conspirators
                    of the offense or
                    the defendants,
                    themselves, who on a
                    net basis lost money
                    trading in the
                    securities of Crazy
                    Eddie before June
                    2nd, 1988.  And to
                    the extent there is
                    money left over,
                    that any third
                    parties who had to
                    make compensation to
                    those victims be
                    themselves
                    compensated.

                    THE COURT:  Because
                    that is a more
                    complex issue, I'd
                    like to get the
                    input from the SEC
                    and experts.  I will
                    defer to another day
                    the disposition of
                    the moneys so far as
                    the public is
                    concerned.

                    My Trustee-Receiver
                    will hold it.  Then
                    I would anticipate
                    the U.S. Attorney's
                    office, in
                    connection with the
                    SEC, will make
                    appropriate
                    applications on
                    notice to the
                    defendant and the
                    defendant's counsel
                    so that we can get
                    everyone's total
                    input.

                    My object in this
                    case from day one
                    has always been to
                    get back to the
                    public that which
                    was taken from it as
                    a result of the
                    fraudulent
                    activities of this
                    defendant and
                    others.  We will
                    work the best
                    possible formula we
                    can to be as fair as
                    possible to the
                    public.  If we can
                    get the 120 million
                    back, we would have
                    accomplished a great
                    deal in this case.

Tr. Sentencing Hearing 407-08 at app. 1008 (emphasis added).
Of course, the italicied language is the crucial passage.
Appellants argue that the statement reflects "an appearance
that the district court had prejudged [their] guilt and that
a number of his rulings were skewed by his determination to
enforce his Repatriation Order in the civil case and to 'get
back' the money from Mr. Antar."  Eddie br. at 10.  Thus, in
their view, the judge's sentencing comments shed light on
the reasons behind several of his rulings, including his
computation of their prison terms and the amount of
restitution.  Lurking in this series of arguments is the
contention that the district court's "goal" during the trial
simply was improper and that that in itself mandated the
judge's disqualification.  In response, the government
relies on the fact that "[b]y that time, however, Antar had
of course been found guilty," and that therefore the
statement "did not indicate that the court had been unfair
to Antar, or even that it had believed he personally was
guilty 'from day one.'"  Br. at 66.

                    The pertinent recusal statute, 28 U.S.C.
Section 455(a), provides that a judge must "disqualify himself
in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be
questioned."  See Liteky v. United States, ____ U.S. ____,
____, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 1150 (1994); United States v. Bertoli,
40 F.3d 1384, 1412 (3d Cir. 1994).  As the Supreme Court
recently made clear, generally beliefs or opinions which
merit recusal must involve an extrajudicial factor.  Liteky,
____ U.S. at ____, 114 S.Ct. at 1157.  For example, if a
judge has acquired a dislike of a litigant because of events
occurring outside of the courtroom, a duty to recuse might
ensue.  However, although such situations are not common,
"opinions formed during a judicial proceeding may in certain
instances give rise to a duty to recuse."  Bertoli, 40 F.3d
at 1412.   As the Liteky Court pointed out, if during "a
lengthy trial . . . the presiding judge for the first time
learns of an obscure religious sect, and acquires a
passionate hatred for all its adherents," the fact that the
beliefs arose through a judicial proceeding does not negate
the duty to recuse.  Id. at     , 114 S.Ct. at 1154; see
also Bertoli, 40 F.3d at 1412.

                    Biases stemming from facts gleaned
during judicial proceedings themselves must be particularly
strong in order to merit recusal.  "A favorable or
unfavorable predisposition can . . . deserve to be
characterized as 'bias' or 'prejudice' [when] even though it
springs from the facts adduced or the events occurring at
trial, it is so extreme as to display clear inability to
render fair judgment."  Liteky,      U.S. at     , 114 S.Ct.
at 1155.  In such situations, then, the court's actions must
"reveal such a high degree of favoritism or antagonism as to
make fair judgment impossible."  Id. at     , 114 S.Ct. at
1157.  By the statutory language itself, though, section
455(a) mandates an objective rather than a subjective
inquiry.  See Bertoli, 40 F.3d at 1412 ("The judge does not
have to be subjectively biased or prejudiced, so long as he
appears to be so.") (quoting Liteky,       U.S. at ____, 114
S.Ct. at 1156 n.2) (emphasis in original); Alexander v.
Primerica Holdings, Inc., 10 F.3d 155, 162 (3d Cir. 1993)
("[T]he public's confidence in the judiciary, which may be
irreparably harmed if a case is allowed to proceed before a
judge who appears to be tainted", requires that "justice
must satisfy the appearance of justice.") (quoting In re
Asbestos Litig., 977 F.2d 764, 776 (3d Cir. 1992)); In re
Int'l Business Mach. Corp., 45 F.3d 641, 643 (2d Cir. 1995).
Therefore, if a "reasonable man, were he to know all the
circumstances, would harbor doubts about the judge's
impartiality" under the applicable standard, then the judge
must recuse.  In re Larson, 43 F.3d 410, 415 (8th Cir. 1994)
(quoting Potashnick v. Port City Constr. Co., 609 F.2d 1101,
1111 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 820, 101 S.Ct. 78
(1980)).

                    Post-Liteky cases involving allegations
of bias derived from judicial proceedings have construed the
exception to the extrajudicial source requirement narrowly.
In United States v. Young, 45 F.3d 1405 (10th Cir. 1995),
for example, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit
reviewed the following colloquy between the trial court and
the defense attorney regarding the scheduling of a trial
date.  The colloquy occurred after the judge had refused to
accept the defendant's guilty plea (upon finding that she
had not sufficiently admitted to criminal wrongdoing) and
after the government's attorney informed the judge that a
plea still was expected:

                    MR. JAPHA[]:
                    Well, your Honor . .
                    . . I'm wondering
                    then if we could
                    start that trial,
                    then, on Monday, May
                    17, because I have a
                    conflict in the
                    middle of the week
                    May 26th and 27th.

                    THE COURT:  No,
                    because I've got the
                    Sarmiento crowd.
                    No.  That's the week
                    I'm in Washington
                    for the federal
                    judges' association.
                    We've got a union
                    meeting.

                    MR. JAPHA:  What
                    about the week
                    before?

                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:
                    He's in trial.

                    THE COURT:   
                    That's when we're
                    going to be in trial
                    on this Sarmiento
                    case for two weeks.
                    That's the six
                    weeks' case that
                    we're going to do in
                    two.  So we're going
                    to have to do your
                    lady on the 24th
                    unless she sees the
                    light.

                    MR. JAPHA:     I
                    hear you.  I'll just
                    say, the difficulty
                    I have is, on
                    Wednesday the 26th
                    and 27th --

                    THE COURT:     And
                    bear in mind this:
                    that the obvious
                    thing that's going
                    to happen to Ms.
                    Young is that she's
                    going to get
                    convicted, and then
                    they're going to
                    sprinkle her and
                    bless her with
                    immunity, and then
                    she's going to get
                    to testify.  And
                    then she's going to
                    pull the same act on
                    me again, and then
                    she's going to the
                    county jail for at
                    least 30 if not 60
                    or 90 days for
                    contempt.  And we'll
                    do that as often as
                    necessary until she
                    starts talking.

Id. at 1414.

                    In Young, the court of appeals found
that the district court was not obligated to recuse.  As the
court pointed out:  "The comments reflected the judge's
belief that Ms. Young was likely to be convicted if she went
to trial.  Such an opinion of what the jury was likely to
find does not show that the judge could not possibly render
fair judgment.  Nothing in the remark indicates that the
judge was unable or unwilling to carry out his
responsibilities impartially."  Id. at 1415-16.  In fact,
the judge only was indicating what he would have done had
certain contingencies occurred.  Nothing he said showed that
he would be partial if those contingencies did not occur.
Moreover, the judge made the statements after the
defendant's first attempt to plead guilty.  Therefore "[t]he
setting in which [the statement] was made indicates that the
judge intended to convey a message to [the defendant] that
if she wanted to enter a guilty plea she would have to admit
knowledge sufficient to constitute an offense under the
statute."  Id. at 1416.

                    In a recent case from the Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, a bankruptcy judge
summarily denied defendants' motion to dismiss the
complaint, summarily granted plaintiff's motion to amend the
complaint, and stated during a hearing that "'any
predisposition this court has in this matter is a result of
things that have taken place in this very courtroom,' and
asserted that 'I am perfectly entitled to conclusions and
judgments based on what takes place in the courtroom.'"  In
the Matter of Huntington Commons Assocs., 21 F.3d 157, 158
(7th Cir. 1994).  The court of appeals ruled that the
judge's impatience with and admonishments to the defendant,
combined with adverse judicial rulings and a vague reference
to a possible "predisposition" were not "remotely sufficient
evidence of the required 'deep-seated and unequivocal
antagonism that would render fair judgment impossible.'"
Id. at 159 (quoting Liteky, U.S. at     , 114 S.Ct. at
1157).  There was nothing to indicate that the judge's
rulings were based on improper considerations.

                    This case is different from those cases
and also from nearly all the reported recusal cases we have
come across.  This is not a case where the district judge is
accused of being biased in a personal way against a
litigant.  Nor is this a case where a judge's rulings are so
indefensible that combined with particular comments they
arguably demonstrate partiality towards or against a party.
It is not even a case where, as in Huntington Commons, it is
argued that the judge's previous experience with the case
may have left him disdainful of one party's position.
Rather, this is a case where the district judge, in stark,
plain and unambiguous language, told the parties that his
goal in the criminal case, from the beginning, was something
other than what it should have been and, indeed, was
improper.  Of course, a trial judge in a criminal proceeding
should ensure that a fair and orderly trial takes place in
the courtroom.  Here, however, the district court told the
parties that his goal from the beginning of the criminal
proceeding was to enforce a repatriation order and final
judgment issued during a concurrent civil proceeding and
give back the proceeds recovered to the public.  It is
difficult to imagine a starker example of when opinions
formed during the course of judicial proceedings display a
high degree of antagonism against a criminal defendant.
After all, the best way to effectuate the district judge's
goal would have been to ensure that the government got as
free a road as possible towards a conviction, which then
would give the judge the requisite leverage to order a large
amount of restitution.  And it goes without saying that this
is an improper role for a district judge during a criminal
trial.

                    We reject the implications of the
government's argument -- that because the statement occurred
after the trial, it cannot form the basis of an allegation
of bias during the trial.  Suppose, for instance, that at
sentencing the district judge informs a defendant that
throughout the trial his object had been to see the
defendant behind bars.  A reasonable observer in such a
scenario would have serious reason to question whether prior
rulings in the case were based on impartial considerations
or on the judge's stated goal.  The fact that the judge's
motivation came to light only after the conclusion of the
trial would be of no moment.  Furthermore, it does not
matter that the judge's rulings in the case may have been
otherwise defensible, for we are concerned with the
appearance of partiality.

                    Moreover, we consider what the situation
would have been if, instead of revealing his goal at the end
of the trial, the judge made the same statement at the
beginning of the trial.  In that scenario, the judge would
have said: "My goal in this case will be to get back to the
public that which was taken from it as a result of the
fraudulent activities of this defendant and others."  There
would be very little question that such a statement would
give rise to a duty to recuse.  The fortuitous fact that the
judge made his goal clear at the end rather than at the
beginning of trial is of no principled consequence.

                    We nevertheless consider whether we
should read the judge's words as meaning something other
than what they say on their face, particularly where, as
here, the judge is a distinguished and respected jurist
whose career has demonstrated anything but unfairness to
litigants.  Thus, the government at oral argument before us
contended that the district judge really was referring to
the civil SEC proceeding rather than the criminal
proceeding.  Or, we could imagine that the district judge
made an unfortunate and isolated statement -- a stray remark
-- after the defendants had been convicted and during a
lengthy and partly spontaneous colloquy during a sentencing
hearing.  In this latter interpretation, the judge would be
pointing out his recognition that from the beginning of the
trial it had been clear that the public had been defrauded
and that after conviction it became clear that it was the
defendants who had perpetrated the fraud.

                    In considering whether the remark should
be so read, we recognize that the matters before the
district court were both lengthy and complicated.  Moreover,
we are conscious of the constant pressures exerted on the
district court in a high profile case such as this and are
aware that we are focusing on one sentence out of volumes of
transcripts.

                    But in determining whether a judge had
the duty to disqualify him or herself, our focus must be on
the reaction of the reasonable observer.  If there is an
appearance of partiality, that ends the matter.  Haines v.
Liggett Group Inc., 975 F.2d 81, 98 (3d Cir. 1992); Lewis v.
Curtis, 671 F.2d 779, 789 (3d Cir.) ("Impartiality and the
appearance of impartiality in a judicial officer are the
sine qua non of the American legal system."), cert. denied,
459 U.S. 880, 103 S.Ct. 176 (1982).  That being the case, we
must be careful not to rewrite what the judge said and
render unreasonable the clearest and most obvious reading of
the language.  After all, we are reviewing a record, and
when all is said and done, the transcript of the proceeding
speaks for itself.  If a reasonable observer is entitled to
take the judge at his word -- and certainly he or she is so
entitled -- we think that after reading the judge's remarks
at sentencing, that reasonable observer would think that the
judge, as he indicated, had the goal in the trial of
recovering substantial funds from the appellants, a goal
which their convictions would help him reach.

                    Our conclusion is further compelled by
the particular circumstances of the case, combined with
certain of the judge's comments and decisions during the
trial, which when read in light of the remark at sentencing,
make a reasonable observer even more concerned that the
judge had an improper goal.

                    For one thing, hearings in the civil SEC
case and the criminal proceeding routinely were held one
after another on the same day.  On January 11, 1993, the
district court heard arguments on both Eddie Antar's
arraignment in the criminal case and the SEC's application
for an order to show cause why Eddie should not be
incarcerated until he purged himself of civil contempt by
repatriating the $52 million that was the subject of the
judge's prior final judgment in the civil case.  See app.
160-73.  As Eddie's trial counsel put it, the civil case and
the criminal case are "clearly interrelated."   App. 167.
On January 14, 1993, the district court held a scheduling
and discovery hearing in the criminal case, and heard
arguments by the SEC on the order to show cause, which
became returnable on February 2, 1993.  App. 176-92.  On
February 2, the court both heard testimony on the SEC's
application and heard arguments and ruled on the
government's application to detain Eddie without bail in the
criminal proceeding.  App. 193-269.  Thus, it is certainly
believable, in light of the sentencing colloquy,  that the
judge's frustration at Eddie's refusal to obey the
repatriation order seeped into his orders in the criminal
case.

                    The repatriation order also figured
heavily during the arguments on the bail application, as one
point of contention centered around whether the $52 million
could be considered Eddie's assets for that purpose:

                    THE COURT:  What
                    about somewhat
                    between 50 and $100
                    million that lay out
                    there some place?
                    What if Mr. Antar
                    were to be put in a
                    situation, escape,
                    go run and through
                    some way get his
                    hands on some 50 or
                    $100 million that
                    might be available
                    to him in other
                    places? . . . .

                    MR. ARSENEAULT:
                    Your Honor, I have
                    two responses.  I
                    recognize the need
                    for the Court to
                    engage in
                    hypothetical
                    hyperboles in
                    weighing this
                    application.  But in
                    terms of the
                    reality, the
                    reality, your Honor,
                    is the assets of Mr.
                    Antar abroad are
                    frozen.  They have
                    been frozen since at
                    least June of this
                    year . . . . So
                    there is no
                    realistic
                    possibility that
                    those assets are
                    available for
                    anybody.

                           *  *  *

                    THE COURT:  Is he
                    willing to sign the
                    papers necessary to
                    have those funds
                    brought under the
                    control of this
                    Court or with the
                    trustee/receiver to
                    abide whatever
                    events may occur in
                    either this criminal
                    case or the civil
                    case?

                    MR. ARSENEAULT:  It
                    may be, your Honor,
                    under certain
                    circumstances.  But
                    independent of that
                    issue, your Honor, I
                    don't believe that
                    issue is tied to the
                    bail application.
                    That money is
                    unattainable.  It is
                    where it is.  It
                    can't be touched.
                    It can't be moved.

                        The government
                    has stood up time
                    and time again
                    before your Honor in
                    this courtroom and
                    said those assets
                    have nothing to do
                    with bail.  They
                    have no impact on
                    bail.  They can't be
                    posted as bail.

                    THE COURT:  Simpson
                    from the SEC says
                    'they belong to me.'
                    He takes the
                    position they belong
                    to him as the
                    judgment creditor.
                    Whether they do or
                    do not, Mr.
                    Arseneault, is not
                    an issue I'm
                    addressing.  At
                    least, titularly
                    they're in the name
                    of Mr. Antar or one
                    of his pseudonames
                    [sic].

                         What I'm saying
                    is what I think is
                    one of the things
                    that is lacking in
                    your bail
                    application is the
                    agreement by Mr.
                    Antar to
                    unequivocally throw
                    before this Court
                    all of those assets
                    and say:  Judge,
                    they will abide the
                    events, whether they
                    be criminal or
                    civil, and let those
                    moneys go.

                        If I'm right --
                    and I have no
                    reason, from the
                    outset, to indicate
                    in a criminal
                    context that he's
                    guilty or not
                    guilty.  I express
                    no opinion at all.
                    But abide the
                    events.  And,
                    Judge -- it seems to
                    me he should say,
                    Judge, if I'm right,
                    I'll get them all
                    back.  These are
                    fake charges.
                    Everything is wrong.
                    I'm an innocent man.
                    I'm as innocent as
                    the chorus of
                    confidence people
                    say I am.

                        Why doesn't he
                    throw it all out,
                    give it to the good
                    old judge here and
                    say:  Judge, you
                    hold it pending the
                    final outcome of the
                    matter and that that
                    is security for the
                    fact that I'm not
                    going to flee.  And,
                    by the way, Judge, I
                    will also get on the
                    stand and under oath
                    disclose to you each
                    and every asset that
                    I have, and I will
                    swear under oath to
                    you, Judge, that I
                    don't have another
                    pittance any place
                    else, either
                    directly or
                    indirectly
                    controlled by me?

                        Wouldn't that
                    be a nice, pure way
                    to come before me?
                    Then, you know, it
                    might start
                    triggering the mind
                    a little bit here.

App. 202-04.

                    There is no question that, as the Liteky
Court put it, "[d]isinterestedness does not mean child-like
innocence."  Liteky,      U.S. at     , 114 S.Ct. at 1155.
And, "not subject to deprecatory characterization as 'bias'
or 'prejudice' are opinions held by judges as a result of
what they learned in earlier proceedings [as i]t has long
been regarded as normal and proper for a judge to sit in the
same case upon its remand, and to sit in successive trials
involving the same defendant."  Id.  Thus, it certainly
would be understandable if the district judge, based on his
experience from the civil proceeding, was "exceedingly ill
disposed towards the defendant, who has been shown to be a
thoroughly reprehensible person."  Id.  But, when a judge
has formed opinions during a civil case, he or she certainly
must be careful not to have those beliefs influence his or
her goal in the criminal case.  During the transcripts
quoted above, the district court quite properly inquired
into Eddie's access to foreign assets.  But, read in light
of the judge's statement at the end of the case, a
reasonable person reading the transcript could not help but
wonder if the judge was using the bail hearing to try to
enforce the repatriation order.  The judge repeatedly
connected the two proceedings in his questions to counsel,
and even the Assistant United States Attorney conceded that
"Mr. Arseneault and I can agree on one thing.  And that is
that I agree it is not the issue whether or not the money
frozen abroad is returned for purposes of this proceeding.
The issue is whether there is any condition or combination
of conditions which will reasonably assure Mr. Antar's
appearance."  App. 211.

                    The repatriation order again came up
during the trial when Eddie's daughter died and his attorney
requested the court to allow him to sit shivah for a
seven-day period of mourning:

                    MR. ARSENEAULT:
                    Without being
                    redundant . . . I
                    ask your Honor to
                    remember, we're more
                    than willing to post
                    whatever surety if
                    the issue is an
                    issue of flight.

                         I've been told
                    before it is not a
                    flight issue; that
                    the issue initially
                    identified was an
                    issue of the
                    Marshals and a
                    brouhaha because of
                    the family split.
                    We now know, thanks
                    to Mr. Dreyfuss'
                    phone call, that is
                    not an issue.

                    THE COURT:  The
                    surety part doesn't
                    make sense.  There
                    is $60 million
                    laying out there.
                    I'm not going to
                    divorce myself from
                    my knowledge.

                    RABBI GREENWALD:
                    Your Honor --

                    THE COURT:  Let me
                    finish.  Let's not
                    get on that subject.

                         There is $60
                    million out there
                    that I'm aware of
                    that your client has
                    refused to sign over
                    to the trustee.  So
                    we're not talking
                    about surety.

                        Come on.  Does
                    he want to sign the
                    60 million over?

App. 518-19.  Again, it was perfectly appropriate for the
district judge to be concerned about the risk of flight
should Eddie be released from jail for seven days, and in
reaching his conclusions to rely on his knowledge of the
foreign accounts.  But a reasonable person reading the
transcript in light of the judge's statement during the
sentencing could not help but wonder if the district judge
was seeking to achieve his stated goal of enforcing the
repatriation order.

                    In other words, it cannot be said fairly
that in holding that the judge should have disqualified
himself we are pulling an isolated statement out of context.
To the contrary, a reasonable person reading the transcripts
would have found other reasons to believe that the judge in
fact was expressing his intention.  Being familiar with the
judge and his work, we are not prepared to say the district
judge actually was biased.  But we are constrained to say
that a reasonable person could think that the judge's goal
during the criminal proceeding -- and the reason behind some
of the rulings -- was to enforce orders he issued in a
parallel civil case.  Because such a goal was entirely
improper in a criminal case, we believe that the judge
should sua sponte have recused himself.  Inasmuch as the
failure to recuse in this context has the appearance of
affecting the fairness and integrity of the trial, and
because it "seriously affect[s] the . . . public reputation
of [the] judicial proceeding[]", Olano,      U.S. at     ,
113 S.Ct. at 1779, we are constrained to exercise our
discretion under Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b) and reverse the
convictions and remand the matters for new trials before a
different district judge.

                    We realize, of course, that the
appearance of a lack of impartiality principally concerned
Eddie.  But we cannot distinguish reasonably between Eddie
and Mitchell in this respect, as they were charged with
offenses arising from the same circumstances.  Furthermore,
the judge indicated that he intended to recover what "this
defendant," meaning Eddie, and "others" had taken by
fraudulent activities.  Clearly, Mitchell was included among
the "others."  Therefore, both appellants are entitled to a
new trial.

                  B. Mitchell's withdrawal

                    Because we are reversing both the
convictions and sentences, we need not address most of the
other issues that the appellants raise as they at most could
lead to new trials.    However, Mitchell argues that since
he resigned from the enterprise prior to the commencement of
the five-year statute of limitations, both conspiracy and
substantive liability for post-resignation acts cannot be
attributed to him based on his alleged membership in the
conspiracy.  Because this is an argument of law which if
successful would require a judgment of acquittal, we address
it on the merits.

                    Mitchell's arguments derive from the
following undisputed facts:  For several years prior to June
5, 1987, he served as an officer of Crazy Eddie, Inc., as a
vice-president in charge of purchasing, a member of the
board of directors, and one of three members of an office of
the president.  During this time, Mitchell allegedly
participated with Eddie and others in the securities fraud
that underlay the RICO indictments.  On June 5, 1987,
Mitchell resigned from the board.  In a statement issued to
the board, he gave the following reasons for his
resignation:

                    Over the past
                    months, my brother
                    Eddie's relationship
                    with my family has
                    been acrimonious and
                    has resulted in a
                    series of very
                    disturbing
                    developments
                    involving the
                    Company.  My father,
                    brother Alan and
                    Eddie's mother-in-
                    law have been fired
                    and certain key
                    employees who are
                    particularly
                    important to the
                    marketing area -- my
                    end of the business,
                    have been forced to
                    resign or have been
                    fired summarily.

                        Although part
                    of the three member
                    Office of the
                    President, I have
                    not been consulted
                    on major decisions,
                    among them the
                    firing of personnel
                    . . . , executive
                    compensation and the
                    like.  Under these
                    conditions, I find
                    it impossible to
                    continue as Director
                    and Executive
                    Officer of the
                    Company.  Therefore,
                    effective
                    immediately, I am
                    resigning as an
                    Executive Officer of
                    Crazy Eddie and as a
                    Director.

June 5, 1987 Statement of Mitchell Antar at JA 254.
Mitchell continued to own stock in the company, selling
30,000 shares on August 21, 1987, 30,000 shares on August
28, 1987, and 1,000 shares on September 23, 1987.  See JA
290.

                    Mitchell contends that to the extent he
participated in an unlawful conspiracy, his participation
ceased on June 5, 1987, prior to the commencement of the
five-year statute of limitations.  Accordingly, he argues
that the conspiracy charges should have been dismissed.  JA
290.  He further argues that to the extent the substantive
counts depend on his participation in an unlawful
conspiracy, they should be dismissed as well.

                    Mitchell's argument regarding the
charged RICO conspiracy begins with the recent Supreme Court
case of Reves v. Ernst & Young, ____ U.S. ____, 113 S.Ct.
1163 (1993), which interpreted RICO, 18 U.S.C. Section 1962(c).
That section makes it unlawful "for any person employed by
or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the
activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce,
to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the
conduct of such enterprise's affairs, through a pattern of
racketeering activity."  In Reves, the Supreme Court
clarified the meaning of the language "to conduct or
participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
enterprise's affairs."  Relying on the words "conduct" and
"participate," the Court reasoned that "some part in
directing the enterprise's affairs is required."  Id. at  
, 113 S.Ct. at 1170 (emphasis added).  Thus, the Court
adopted the "operation or management" test previously
followed by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and
held that "one is not liable under [section 1962(c)] unless
one has participated in the operation or management of the
enterprise itself."  Id.     , 113 S.Ct. at 1172.  While the
Court did not limit the statute's reach to persons in upper
management, it did emphasize that the person being sued must
exercise some control over the enterprise.

                    In light of Reves, it seems fairly clear
that Mitchell could not have been charged with violating
section 1962(c) based on his acts after he resigned from
Crazy Eddie.  While he continued to own stock in the
company, there is no evidence to indicate that he played any
role in operating or managing the enterprise.  But that does
not necessarily mean that he is not chargeable for
conspiring to violate section 1962(c).

                    RICO's conspiracy section, section
1962(d), makes it unlawful for any person to conspire to
violate sections 1962(a), (b), or (c).  Despite Reves, a
number of courts have held that even if a person may not be
held directly liable for violating section 1962(c), he or
she still may be liable for conspiring to violate section
1962(c).  In United States v. Quintanilla, 2 F.3d 1469 (7th
Cir. 1993), for example, Gutierrez participated in a scheme
to defraud a corporation of money by submitting false
funding proposals to a corporate program designed to fund
various social events.  It appears from the court of
appeals' discussion that Gutierrez, while assisting her
boyfriend in submitting the false proposals, did not operate
or manage the enterprise in any way, and therefore did not
violate section 1962(c).  Nonetheless, she was charged with
and was convicted of conspiring to violate section 1962(c)
pursuant to section 1962(d).  On appeal, Gutierrez argued
that Reves barred her conviction under section 1962(d).  The
court of appeals disagreed, reasoning as follows:

                    The defendant
                    confuses her
                    conviction for
                    conspiracy (an
                    agreement to commit
                    a crime) with a
                    conviction for a
                    substantive crime.
                    She was charged in
                    Count One of the
                    superseding
                    indictment with
                    violating 18 U.S.C.
                    Section 1962(d) . . . .
                    Section 1962(d),
                    unlike Section 1962(c), is
                    not a substantive

                    RICO offense;
                    rather, Section 1962(d)
                    merely makes it
                    illegal to conspire
                    to violate any of
                    the preceding
                    sections of the
                    statute.

Quintanilla, 2 F.3d at 1484.  Thus, "[o]ne violates Section
1962(d) . . . when she agrees to violate a substantive RICO
offense, regardless of whether she personally agreed to
commit the predicate crimes or actually participated in the
commission of those crimes."  Id.  Other courts have used
similar reasoning in upholding section 1962(d) liability
when section 1962(c) liability proved unavailing.  See,
e.g., United States v. Viola, 35 F.3d 37, 43 (2d Cir. 1994)
(A "RICO conspiracy charge is proven if the defendant
'embraced the objective of the alleged conspiracy,' and
agreed to commit two predicate acts in furtherance thereof"
irrespective of the fact that the defendant "did not
participate in the operation or management of the
enterprise.") (citing United States v. Neapolitan, 791 F.2d
489, 499 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S.Ct.
422 (1986)), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct. 1270 (1995); Jones v.
Meridian Towers Apartments, Inc., 816 F. Supp. 762, 773
(D.D.C. 1993) ("To hold that under Section 1962(d) a plaintiff
must show that an alleged coconspirator was capable of
violating the substantive offense under Section 1962(c), that is,
that he participated to the extent required by Reves, 'would
add an element to RICO conspiracy that Congress did not
direct.'") (quoting United States v. Pryba, 900 F.2d 748,
760 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 924, 111 S.Ct. 305
(1990)); Fidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Felicetti, 830
F. Supp. 257, 261 (E.D. Pa. 1993) ("[L]iability under Section
1962(d) turns not on whether a defendant personally commits
the predicate acts, but rather that the defendant agrees
only to the commission of the predicate acts.").

                    Nonetheless, Mitchell's argument that
courts risk eviscerating Reves by blanketly approving
conspiracy convictions when substantive convictions under
section 1962(c) are unavailable has some merit.  There is no
question that a broad reading of the cases cited above would
be problematic.  As one commentator has explained, "[i]f
Congress' restriction of section 1962(c) liability to those
who operate or manage the enterprise can be avoided simply
by alleging that a defendant aided and abetted or conspired
with someone who operated or managed the enterprise, then
Reves would be rendered almost nugatory."  David B. Smith &
Terrance G. Reed, Civil RICO, Section 5.04 at 5-39 (1994). But
we believe that a distinction can be drawn between, on the one
hand, conspiring to operate or manage an enterprise, and, on
the other, conspiring with someone who is operating or
managing the enterprise.  Liability under section 1962(d)
would be permissible under the first scenario, but, without
more, not under the second.  This is because in the former
situation, the defendant is conspiring to do something for
which, if the act was completed successfully, he or she
would be liable under section 1962(c).  But in the latter
scenario, the defendant is not conspiring to do something
for which he or she could be held liable under the
substantive clause of the statute.  Therefore, liability
should not attach.  The distinction we draw derives directly
from 18 U.S.C. Section 1962(d) which provides that it is
"unlawful for any person to conspire to violate" sections
1962(a), (b), or (c).  (Emphasis added.)  Of course, under
section 1962(d) a "person" is not limited to a person
"employed by or associated with any enterprise" as is the
case under section 1962(c).

                    This case falls into that former
category, i.e., a conspiracy to operate or manage an
enterprise, and therefore Reves and its concomitant policies
do not conflict with the conspiracy convictions.  This is
not because, as the government argues, the defendant is
confusing section 1962(c) liability with liability under
section 1962(d).  As detailed above, there are situations
when section 1962(d) convictions would conflict with Reves'
interpretation of section 1962(c).  Rather, it is because
here section 1962(d) liability is premised on Mitchell's
membership in the conspiracy, and his performance at that
time as an operator or manager of the enterprise.  In
determining whether Mitchell arguably was a member of the
conspiracy, the jury could consider his pre-resignation
acts.  For instance, imagine a manager of an enterprise,
engaged in racketeering activity, who then leaves the
enterprise to start an accounting practice, and becomes the
enterprise's auditor.  If his resignation did not constitute
withdrawal from the conspiracy, the statute of limitations
never started running.  Liability is premised on ordinary
principles of conspiracy law, and has nothing to do with the
policies behind Reves.  This is precisely that situation,
and thus, the question is solely whether, having joined the
conspiracy, and having committed overt acts in furtherance
of the conspiracy, Mitchell can be held liable for the
conspiracy based on acts committed by co-conspirators after
his resignation.  In other words, this is a withdrawal case,
and Reves has nothing relevant to say on that point.

                    In this regard, section 1962(d) long has
been interpreted against the backdrop of traditional
conspiracy law and thus the same analysis applies both to
the RICO and section 371 conspiracies.  Under that body of
law, there is no question that "the statute of limitations
does not bar an action for RICO conspiracy against that
individual if he or she continues as a coconspirator and
another conspirator acted within the five year period."
United States v. Gatto, 746 F. Supp. 432, 463 (D.N.J. 1990)
(citing United States v. Persico, 832 F.2d 705, 713 (2d Cir.
1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1022, 108 S.Ct. 1995 (1988)).
However, if a defendant properly and adequately terminates
his or her involvement with the conspiracy, he or she no
longer can be held responsible for acts of his or her co-
conspirators and the statute of limitations begins to run in
his behalf.  See Gatto, 746 F. Supp. at 463 ("Where the
conspiracy continues into the limitations period, an
individual conspirator can commence the running of the
statute of limitations as to him or her by affirmatively
withdrawing from the conspiracy.").

                    The Supreme Court long ago set forth a
rigorous standard for demonstrating withdrawal.  In 1912 in
Hyde v. United States, 225 U.S. 347, 32 S.Ct. 793 (1912),
the Court explained as follows:

                    Having joined in an
                    unlawful scheme,
                    having constituted
                    agents for its
                    performance, scheme
                    and agency to be
                    continuous until
                    full fruition be
                    secured, until he
                    does some act to
                    disavow or defeat
                    the purpose he is in
                    no situation to
                    claim the delay of
                    the law.  As the
                    offense has not been
                    terminated or
                    accomplished, he is
                    still offending.
                    And, we think,
                    consciously
                    offending, offending
                    as certainly . . .
                    as at the first
                    moment of his
                    confederation, and
                    continuously through
                    every moment of its
                    existence. . . .
                    Until he does
                    withdraw there is
                    conscious offending
                    . . . .

Id. at 369-70, 32 S.Ct. at 803 (emphasis added).  Thus, we
have held that "[m]ere cessation of activity in furtherance
of an illegal conspiracy does not necessarily constitute
withdrawal."  United States v. Steele, 685 F.2d 793, 803 (3d
Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 908, 103 S.Ct. 213
(1982).  Rather, "[t]he defendant must present evidence of
some affirmative act of withdrawal on his part, typically
either a full confession to the authorities or communication
to his co-conspirators that he has abandoned the enterprise
and its goals."  Id. at 803-04 (emphasis added); see also
United States v. Heckman, 479 F.2d 726, 729 (3d Cir. 1973).
Of course, there is no single way withdrawal can be
established; in large part whether a particular action
constitutes withdrawal depends on context.  Thus, the
Supreme Court has cautioned against placing "confining
blinders" on the jury's consideration of evidence of
withdrawal and has held that "[a]ffirmative acts
inconsistent with the object of the conspiracy and
communicated in a manner reasonably calculated to reach co-
conspirators have generally been regarded as sufficient to
establish withdrawal or abandonment."  United States v.
United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 464-65, 98 S.Ct.
2864, 2887 (1978).

                    We have divided the standard for showing
withdrawal into two stages.  First, the defendant must come
forward with evidence evincing a prima facie showing of
withdrawal.  If the defendant makes this prima facie
showing, the burden then shifts to the government to rebut
the prima facie case, "either by impeaching the defendant's
proof or by going forward with evidence of some conduct in
furtherance of the conspiracy subsequent to the act of
withdrawal."  United States v. Local 560, 974 F.2d 315, 338
(3d Cir. 1992) (citing Steele, 685 F.2d at 804).

                    This case poses the question of when
retirement or resignation from an enterprise constitutes
withdrawal from a conspiracy utilizing that enterprise.  We
have had a number of occasions to write about such
situations, and those cases assist us in articulating a
standard.  In United States v. Gillen, 599 F.2d 541 (3d
Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 866, 100 S.Ct. 137 (1979), the
defendant argued that the burden shifted to the government
to disprove withdrawal after he established that he "began
removing himself [from the enterprise] except for labor
negotiations and his efforts to sell the company."  Id. at
547-48.  We disagreed, noting that "[t]he burden is . . . on
the defendant to prove '(a)ffirmative acts inconsistent with
the object of the conspiracy and communicated in a manner
reasonably calculated to reach co-conspirators.'"  Id. at
548 (citing United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. at 464, 98
S.Ct. at 2887) (first alteration added).  In United States
v. Lowell, 649 F.2d 950, 955-60 (3d Cir. 1981), we held that
withdrawal was a jury question when the defendant severed
his ties to the enterprise yet subsequently committed acts
that at least arguably demonstrated post-retirement
participation in the conspiracy.  In contrast to Lowell, the
defendant in Steele completely severed his ties with the
enterprise, and when that evidence went unrebutted by the
government, we held that the defendant had established
withdrawal as a matter of law.  Steele, 685 F.2d at 804.

                    Analysis of these cases leads to the
following principles:  (1) resignation from the enterprise
does not, in and of itself, constitute withdrawal from a
conspiracy as a matter of law; (2) total severing of ties
with the enterprise may constitute withdrawal from the
conspiracy; however (3) even if the defendant completely
severs his or her ties with the enterprise, the defendant
still may remain a part of the conspiracy if he or she
continues to do acts in furtherance of the conspiracy and
continues to receive benefits from the conspiracy's
operations.

                    When seen through the lens of a two-
stage burden of proof, we believe the cases establish that
if the defendant completely severs his or her relationship
with the enterprise, he or she has established a prima facie
showing of withdrawal from the conspiracy without showing
any other affirmative act inconsistent with the conspiracy
and without giving any further notice to his or her co-
conspirators.  Once the defendant makes this showing, the
burden shifts to the government either to rebut the
defendant's showing or to establish that the defendant
continued to participate as a co-conspirator.  However, if
the defendant has not completely severed his ties with the
enterprise, then in order to establish a prima facie case,
he must demonstrate either that he gave notice to his co-
conspirators that he disavows the purpose of the conspiracy
or that he did acts inconsistent with the object of the
conspiracy.         This approach is consistent with that
taken by other courts of appeal.  For instance, the Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit recently concluded that a
defendant-attorney had not withdrawn from a conspiracy when,
although he resigned from the enterprise law firm, he
"'continued to be entitled to a percentage of the recovery
on all cases he tried including those giving rise to his
pre-[resignation] racketeering acts.'"  United States v.
Eisen, 974 F.2d 246, 269 (2d Cir. 1992) (citation omitted),
cert. denied, ___ U.S. ____, 113 S.Ct. 1840 (1993).
Conversely, in the civil RICO case of Krause v. Perryman,
827 F.2d 346 (8th Cir. 1987), the defendant produced
uncontradicted and unrebutted evidence that he had "sold all
his stock and resigned as president of [the enterprise]"
prior to the events that injured the plaintiffs.  Id. at
351.  The court concluded that he was entitled to summary
judgment.

                    Applying these principles to this case,
it is clear that Mitchell has not established a prima facie
case of withdrawal.  While he resigned from Crazy Eddie, he
did not sever all his ties with the enterprise.  To the
contrary, Mitchell concedes that he retained stock in the
enterprise until September 16, 1987, a date within the five-
year limitations period. Therefore, Mitchell continued to
receive the fruits of the fraud.  Moreover, Mitchell has
produced no evidence that he acted inconsistently with the
goals of the conspiracy.  While he points out that he
participated in an attempt to take over Crazy Eddie, there
is nothing to indicate that he would have exposed the fraud.
To the contrary, his failure to say anything about the fraud
indicates otherwise.

                    Mitchell argues that by focusing on his
retention of stock, he is put in a catch-22 situation:  If
he sells the stock, he benefits from the conspiracy; if he
retains the stock, he has not severed his ties with the
enterprise and can be liable for substantive securities
fraud.  The argument is wrong.  If he sells the stock, he
may have benefitted from the conspiracy at that particular
time, and, depending on whether the elements of the crime
are met, may or may not be liable for securities fraud.  But
from that day forward, his relationship with the enterprise
would be severed, and the statute of limitations would run.
There is no catch-22.

                    Because Mitchell did not make out a
prima facie case of withdrawal, he was not entitled to have
the RICO conspiracy, the section 371 conspiracy, and the
substantive fraud counts dismissed as a matter of law on the
basis that his resignation from Crazy Eddie constituted
withdrawal from the conspiracy.


                         CONCLUSION

reverse the convictions and sentences of both Eddie Antar
and Mitchell Antar, and we will remand the case for a new
trial before a different district judge to be selected by
the Chief Judge of the District of New
Jersey.

Before:  VAN GRAAFEILAND and McLAUGHLIN, Circuit Judges, and

   [*] Honorable Ellen Bree Burns, of the United States District
Court for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation.

   In Jeffries v. Harleston, 21 F.3d 1238 (2d Cir. 1994), we
held that a city university could not fire a non-policymaking
employee for speaking on issues of public concern unless the
speech actually disrupted government operations. See 21 F.3d at
1245-47. Subsequently, in an unrelated case, a plurality of the
United States Supreme Court indicated that: the government could
fire such an employee based on a reasonable prediction that the
speech will cause disruption. See Waters v. Churchill, 511 U.S.,
114 S. Ct. 1878, 1887, 1889 (1994) (plurality opinion). The
Supreme Court then vacated the judgment entered in Jeffries, and
remanded to us for reconsideration in light of Waters. See
Harleston v. Jeffries, 115 S. Ct. 502, 503 (1994) (memorandum).

     We now reverse the judgment of the district court, and
remand with instructions to enter judgment for the defendants.

McLAUGHLIN, Circuit Judge:

  In Jeffries v. Harleston, 21 F.3d 1238 (2d Cir. 1994), we
affirmed the district court's judgment that 15 university
officials violated the First Amendment rights of a professor,
Leonard Jeffries, by reducing his term as a department chairman
because of a controversial speech (the "Albany speech") he had
given off campus. Our decision rested on what we understood to
be the applicable rule that the government cannot take action
against an employee for speaking on public issues, unless it
first shows that the speech actually "impaired the efficiency of
government operations." Id. at 1245. We also vacated the part
of the judgment that found six of the defendants liable for
punitive damages, as the jury's special verdict responses were
"hopelessly irreconcilable" on whether these defendants
harbored the necessary evil motives. Id. at 1250.

  A month after our decision in Jeffries, the United States
Supreme Court decided Waters v. Churchill, 511 U.S. , 114 S.
Ct. 1878 (1994) (plurality opinion). A four-justice plurality
in Waters held that the government could fire an employee for
disruptive speech based on its reasonable belief of what the
employee said, regardless of what was actually said. See
Waters, 114 S. Ct. at 1889. In addition, when weighing the
value of the employee's speech against the interference with
government operations, the Waters plurality also indicated that
a government employer need only show that the speech is likely
to be disruptive before the speaker may be punished. See id.
at 1887, 1890.

  The Jeffries defendants, relying on Waters, petitioned the
Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. The Supreme Court
granted certiorari, and, without comment, vacated Jeffries and
remanded to us for reconsideration in light of Waters. See
Harleston v. Jeffries, 115 S. Ct. 502, 503 (1994) (memorandum).

  On remand from the Supreme Court, we reverse the district
court's judgment because defendants made a substantial showing
at trial that their decision to limit Jeffries' term was based
upon a reasonable prediction that the Albany speech would
disrupt university operations.

                       BACKGROUND

  We summarize the facts briefly; a more detailed account
appears in our initial opinion. See Jeffries, 21 F.3d 1238,
1241-44.

  Leonard Jeffries was the chairman of the Black Studies
department at City College of New York ("City College"),
which is part of the City University of New York ("CUNY")
system. In delivering the Albany speech, which addressed the
bias of New York State's public school curriculum and the
history of black oppression, Jeffries made several derogatory
statements, particularly about Jews. After the speech, City
College President Bernard Harleston and CUNY Chancellor Ann
Reynolds arranged for the CUNY Board of Trustees to vote as to
whether to limit Jeffries' term as department chair to one
year, even though such terms normally last three years. A
majority of the 14 members of the CUNY Board of Trustees voted
to limit Jeffries' term. The votes were cast as follows: Nine
of the Trustees voted to limit Jeffries' term to a year; four
voted to remove him immediately; one abstained because she had
made critical comments about Jeffries in the past. Harleston
and Reynolds did not vote because they were not Trustees.

  Jeffries sued Harleston, Reynolds, and all 14 of the
individual CUNY trustees under 42 U.S.C. 1983 in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York
(Kenneth Conboy, Judge), alleging that they removed him in
violation of the First Amendment. (One of the 16 original
defendants, Trustee Blanche Bernstein, died during the trial,
and Jeffries discontinued his claims against her.) Jeffries
sought reinstatement and punitive damages.

  The jury was given several sets of interrogatories to
answer. In response to the first wave, the jury found that the
defendants demoted Jeffries because of the Albany speech. The
jury's answers also indicated that the Albany speech did not
disrupt "the effective and efficient operation of the Black
Studies Department, the College, or the University," but that
the defendants "were motivated in their actions by a reasonable
expectation" that the speech would cause such a disruption. The
judge concluded from these responses that all 15 remaining
defendants had violated Jeffries' First Amendment rights because
the speech was substantially on matters of public concern, and
did not cause actual harm to CUNY.

  The judge then submitted another wave of questions to the
jury to discern the individual liability of each of the 15
defendants. In response, the jury found that only six defendants
-- Harleston, Reynolds, and Trustees Edith Everett, Herman
Badillo, Sylvia Bloom, and Harold Jacobs (together, the
"Harleston defendants") -- took action against Jeffries because
of the Albany speech, and would not have done so had Jeffries
not given the speech. Of the four Trustees who are Harleston
defendants, three had voted to remove Jeffries from his post
immediately, and one had abstained because of the negative
statements she had made about Jeffries in the past. (The fourth
vote to remove Jeffries immediately came from Trustee Bernstein,
who died during the trial, and is not part of this appeal.) The
jury found that the other nine defendants, all of whom had voted
to limit Jeffries' term to one year, did not act with the same
retaliatory animus.

  On the third and final wave of interrogatories, the jury
found that all six of the Harleston defendants had "acted with
malicious intent to violate the plaintiff's rights under the
First Amendment . . . or with malicious intent to unlawfully
injure him, or . . . with a callous or reckless disregard of the
plaintiff's First Amendment rights." Based on these findings,
the jury awarded punitive damages against the Harleston
defendants.

  After finding that the defendants were not shielded from
liability by qualified immunity, the district judge entered
judgment consistent with the jury responses (although he reduced
the punitive damage amounts). In addition, the judge ordered
the defendants to reinstate Jeffries as chairman of the
department for two years. The defendants appealed.

  We affirmed the reinstatement order, agreeing with the
district court that the defendants had violated Jeffries' right
to free speech, and that the Harleston defendants were not
shielded by qualified immunity. See Jeffries, 21 F.3d at 1245-
49. We found, however, that the jury's special verdict
responses were inconsistent regarding the six Harleston
defendants' liability for punitive damages. Specifically, we
could not reconcile the jury's finding that all 15 of the
remaining defendants demoted Jeffries based on their reasonable
belief that the Albany speech would harm CUNY, with its later
finding that the six Harleston defendants demoted Jeffries out
of a malicious desire to violate his free speech rights, or at
least in reckless disregard of these rights. Thus, we vacated
the punitive damage awards against the six Harleston
defendants, and remanded for a new trial against these six on
the punitives issue. See id. at 1249-50.

  Upon the defendants' petition, the Supreme Court granted
certiorari, vacated our judgment, and remanded with instructions
to reconsider our opinion in light of Waters. See Harleston,
115 S. Ct. at 503.

                       DISCUSSION

  One of the principles driving our earlier Jeffries decision
I was that the First Amendment protects a government employee
who speaks out on issues of public interest from censure by his
employer unless the speech actually disrupted the employer's
operations. See Jeffries, 21 F.3d at 1245. We expressly held
that a mere reasonable belief that the speech would interfere
with the employer's operations is not enough to discipline an
employee, unless the employee holds a high-level, policymaking
position. See id. at 1246-47.

  Applying that standard, we studied the Albany speech, and
found that it squarely involved issues of public concern --
namely, the New York state public school curriculum, and black
oppression throughout history. See id. at 1245-46. Then, after
examining CUNY's bylaws, and the testimony of CUNY officials, we
agreed with the district court that the position of Black
Studies Chairman was a ministerial position at CUNY, and carried
no policymaking authority. See id. at 1246-47. Thus, we held
that the defendants bore the burden at trial to show that the
speech actually interfered with CUNY operations. See id. at
1246. Given the jury's finding that the defendants had failed to
make this showing, we held that the defendants had violated
Jeffries' free speech rights. See id. at 1248.

  At the time, the strict actual interference requirement
reflected the law of the Second Circuit. See Piesco v. City of
New York, 933 F.2d 1149, 1160 (2d Cir.) (if the speech "so
clearly touch[es] on matters of public concern, the government
is required to demonstrate interference with the efficient
functioning of the workplace"), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 331
(1991); see also Rankin v. McPherson, 483 U.S. 378, 390-91
(1987) (nature of employee's position determines whether the
employee's speech "somehow undermines the mission of the public
employer"). The recent Waters decision, however, has loosened
Piesco's shackles upon public employers.

                           I.

  In Waters, a four-justice plurality held that the
government could fire an employee for disruptive speech based
on the government's reasonable belief of what the employee
said, regardless of what was actually said. See Waters, 114 S.
Ct. at 1887, 1889 (O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnlquist, C.J.,
Souter and Ginsburg, JJ.). Here, however, there is no dispute
as to what Jeffries actually said in the Albany speech.
Accordingly, we need pursue only that part of Waters dealing
with the disruptiveness of the speech.

  The Waters plurality reiterated the test of Connick v.
Myers, 461 U.S. 138 (1983), to determine when the First
Amendment protects speech by a government employee:

 To be protected, the speech must be on a matter of public
concern, and the employee's interest in expressing herself on
this matter must not be outweighed by any injury the speech
could cause to the "'interest of the State, as an employer, in
promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs
through its employees."'

114 S. Ct at 1884 (quoting Connick, 461 U.S. at 142 (quoting
Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist., 391
U.S. 563, 568 (1968))).

  The plurality then explained that, in applying this test,
the extent of the injury caused by the employee's speech need
not be actual; rather, the government's burden is just to show
that the speech threatened to interfere with government
operations. See id. at 1887, 1890. It emphasized that greater
deference must be given to the government when it acts as
employer rather than as sovereign:

  [W]e have given substantial weight to government employers'
reasonable predictions of disruption. even when the speech
involved is on a matter of public concern, and even though when
the government is acting as sovereign our review of legislative
predictions of harm is considerably less deferential.

           .......

  [A] government employee, like any citizen, may have a strong,
legitimate interest in speaking out on public matters. In many
such situations the government may have to make a substantial
showing that the speech is, in fact, likely to be disruptive
before it may be punished.

Id. at 1887 (emphasis added); see also United States v.
Treasury Employees Union, 115 S. Ct. 1003, 1018 n.21 (1995)
(quoting Waters to reaffirm that deference is given to
government's reasonable predictions of harm when used to
justify the punishment of isolated incidents of employee
speech).

  We read the Waters plurality opinion to hold that the
closer the employee's speech reflects on matters of public
concern, the greater must be the employer's showing that the
speech is likely to be disruptive before it may be punished.
See Treasury Employees Union, 115 S. Ct. at 1021 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in part, dissenting in part) ("As the magnitude of
intrusion on employees' interests rises, so does the
Government's burden of justification."). There is, thus, a
proportion between the nature of the speech and the nature of
the sanction that may ensue. Nevertheless, even when the
speech is squarely on public issues, -- and thus earns the
greatest constitutional protection -- Waters indicates that the
government's burden is to make a substantial showing of likely
interference and not an actual disruption. 114 S. Ct. at 1887.

                          II.

   Whittled to its core, Waters permits a government
employer to fire an employee for speaking on a matter of public
concern if: (1) the employer's prediction of disruption is
reasonable; (2) the potential disruptiveness is enough to
outweigh the value of the speech; and (3) the employer took
action against the employee based on this disruption and not
in retaliation for the speech. See Waters, 114 S. Ct. at 1887,
1889-91. By stressing that actual disruption is not required,
Waters pulls a crucial support column out from under our
earlier Jeffries opinion. We are now constrained to hold under
Waters that the defendants did not violate Jeffries' free
speech rights if: (1) it was reasonable for them to believe
that the Albany speech would disrupt CUNY operations; (2) the
potential interference with CUNY operations outweighed the
First Amendment: value of the Albany speech; and (3) they
demoted Jeffries because they feared the ramifications for
CUNY, or, at least, for reasons wholly unrelated to the Albany
speech.

  In the district court, the Jury's central finding was that
all 15 defendants were "motivated" to demote Jeffries by a
"reasonable expectation" that the Albany speech would harm CUNY.
This jury finding establishes that because the defendants were
motivated by a reasonable prediction of disruption, they did not
demote him for an improper retaliatory motive. Moreover, we hold
that, as a matter of law, this potential disruptiveness was
enough to outweigh whatever First Amendment value the Albany
speech might have had. Under Waters, then, the jury's finding,
if it stood alone, would suffice to show that none of the
defendants violated Jeffries' free speech rights.

  This finding does not stand alone, however. In response to
later waves of interrogatories, the jury found that the six
Harleston defendants (but -- significantly -- not the other
nine) demoted Jeffries because of the Albany speech, and that
they would not have done so if Jeffries had not given the
speech. The jury then decided that the six Harleston defendants
"acted with malicious intent to violate the plaintiff's rights
First Amendment rights."

  These later findings are tantamount to a determination that
the six Harleston defendants demoted Jeffries in retaliation for
his speech, and not to protect CUNY from the ramifications of
his speech. See Rankin, 483 U.S. at 384 ("Vigilance is necessary
to ensure that public employers do not use authority over
employees to silence discourse, not because it hampers public
functions but simply because superiors disagree with the
content of employees' speech.").

  As we said in the original Jeffries opinion, we cannot
harmonize the jury's earlier finding with the later ones. See
Jeffries, 21 F.3d at 1250. If, as the first finding has it, all
the defendants demoted Jeffries because they reasonably believed
the speech would harm CUNY, the demotion was not retaliatory.
If, as the later findings have it, six of the defendants acted
against Jeffries out of malice or reckless disregard for his
rights, those six were not motivated by a reasonable belief that
the speech would harm CUNY. As to these six defendants, these
findings are "hopelessly irreconcilable," id., and would
ordinarily require a remand for a new trial. See Brooks v.
Brattleboro Mem. Hosp., 958 F.2d 525, 529-30 (2d Cir. 1992)
(remand required where material jury responses cannot be read
together rationally).

  No retrial is needed here, however, because elementary
principles of causation compel the conclusion that Jeffries'
First Amendment rights were not violated. See 42 U.S.C. 1983
(section 1983 relief only available if the plaintiff was
deprived of federal rights). The jury found that at least nine
of the defendants, a clear majority, limited Jeffries' term
because they expected his speech would harm CUNY (and not for
invidious motives), and that this expectation was reasonable.

  There is, moreover, no reasonable possibility that the six
Harleston defendants tainted the vote with whatever retaliatory
motives they may have had. Three of the six Harleston defendants
voted against the proposal to limit Jeffries' term to one year;
two of them were not Trustees, and thus could not vote; and one
abstained. While Harleston and Reynolds were instrumental in
putting the one-term issue on the Board's agenda, see id. at
1247, and may indeed have done so to punish Jeffries, the nine
votes based on legitimate grounds constitute a superseding cause
breaking the causal chain between the tainted motives (of
Harleston and Reynolds) and the decision to limit Jeffries'
term. See Gutierrez-Rodriguez v. Cartagena, 882 F.2d 553, 561
(1st Cir. 1989) (superseding causes relieve defend,ants of
section 1983 liability). And, to whatever extent any of the
Harleston defendants inveighed against Jeffries and his speech
at the Board meetings, the jury expressly found that these
lamentations did not affect the nine Trustee defendants who
based their votes on a reasonable expectation of harm. Thus,
the motives of the Harleston defendants -- whatever they were
-- did not cause a cognizable injury to Jeffries.

  Finally, we note that an amicus curiae argues that we
should not apply Waters at all because Jeffries, as a faculty
member in a public university, deserves greater protection from
state interference with his speech than did the nurse in Waters
who complained about the obstetrics division of the hospital. We
recognize that academic freedom is an important First Amendment
concern. See. e.g. Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589.
603 (1967) ("The vigilant protection of constitutional freedoms
is nowhere more vital than in the community of American
schools."). Jeffries' academic freedom, however, has not been
infringed here. As we held in the earlier Jeffries, and as
Jeffries himself has argued, the position of department chair at
CUNY is ministerial, and provides no greater public contact than
an ordinary professorship. See Jeffries, 21 F.3d at 1247.
Jeffries is still a tenured professor at CUNY, and the
defendants have not sought to silence him, or otherwise limit
his access to the "marketplace of ideas" in the classroom. See
Keyishian, 385 U.S. at 603.

   CONCLUSION

  Because the only defendants who voted in favor of
limiting Jeffries' term did so constitutionally, and because
the Harleston defendants did not contribute to the decision to
limit Jeffries' term, we conclude that Jeffries has not
suffered a deprivation of his constitutional rights.

  We reverse the judgment of the district court, and remand
with instructions to enter judgment for the defendants.

  REVERSED and REMANDED with instructions to enter judgment
for the defendants.

            Manuel L. Real, District Judge, Presiding

                     Argued and Submitted
            February 7, 1995 at Pasadena, California

* This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may
not be cited to or used by the courts of this circuit except
as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.

Before:     FERGUSON, BEEZER and NOONAN, Circuit Judges.

     Plaintiffs George Wendt and John Ratzenberger appeal the
district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of
defendant Host International, Inc. ("Host") and applicant in
intervention Paramount Pictures Corporation ("Paramount"), as
well as the district court's orders awarding Host and
Paramount their attorney fees. This case involves claims
arising from the alleged appropriation of plaintiffs'
identities in the design of animatronic figures placed in bars
operated by defendant Host. We have jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C.
Section 1291, and we reverse.

                           I

     We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. Jesinger
v. Nevada Fed. Credit Union, 24 F.3d 1127, 1130 (9th Cir.
1994). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the
nonmoving party, and must determine whether there are disputed
issues of material fact and whether the district court
correctly applied the substantive law. Id. at 1339-40.

                           II

     At the outset, we wish to make it clear that this is not
a preemption case. Plaintiffs' causes of action are not
preempted by federal copyright law. Midler v. Ford Motor Co.,
849 F.2d 460, 462-63 (9th Cir. 1988) ("What is put forward as
protectable here is more personal than any work of authorship
added). More broadly, plaintiffs' claims are not preempted by
the federal copyright statute so long as they "contain
elements, such as the invasion of personal rights. . . That
are different in kind from copyright infringement." Waits v.
Frito Lay, Inc., 978 F.2d 1093, 1100 (9th Cir. 1992) (quoting
H. R. Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 132, reprinted in
1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5748), cert. denied, 113 S.Ct. 1047
(1993).

     In Waits, we held that the unauthorized commercial use of
one's identity is an invasion of "a personal property right,"
different in kind from copyright infringement. 978 F.2d at
1100. This is true because the torts at issue require the
proof of additional elements beyond those essential to show
copyright infringement. See id. For example, both section 3344
and the common law right of publicity tort require proof that
the defendant's use of the plaintiff's "likeness" or
"identity" was commercial (i.e. connected with selling or
promoting a product), whereas copyright infringement occurs
with any unauthorized copying of the protected material. See
17 U.S.C. Sections 106, 501; Brown Bag Software v. Symantec
Corp., 960 F.2d 1472 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S.Ct. 198
(1992).

     Plaintiffs' state law causes of action are not preempted
by the operation of federal copyright statutes.

                         III

     The district court ruled, based upon photographs of
Wendt, Ratzenberger and the "Hank" and "Bob" animatronic
figures, that, as a matter of law, the figures were
insufficiently similar to plaintiffs to constitute their
"likenesses" under California Civil Code Section 3344. We
disagree; there are disputed issues of material fact which
preclude summary judgment.

     Section 3344 is a statutory enactment of the commercial
appropriation derivation of the common-law right to privacy.
See W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Torts Section
117, at 851-52 (5th ed. 1984). In pertinent part, it provides
that "(a)ny person who knowingly uses another's name, voice,
signature, photography, or likeness, in any manner . . . for
purposes of advertising or selling . . . without such person's
prior consent . . . shall be liable for any damages sustained
by the person or persons injured as a result thereof." Cal.
Civ. Code Section 3344 (West 1995). A "likeness" refers to a
visual image of a person, other than a photograph. Midler, 849
F.2d at 463; see also Cal. Civ. Code Section 3344(b) (defining
"photograph").

     In White v. Samsung Electronics America, Inc., 971 F.2d
1395, 1397 (9th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113 S.Ct. 24434
(1993), we determined that a robot in a blonde wig with
metallic, mechanical features was not the "likeness" of Vanna
White under section 3344. Importantly, White makes it clear
that whether an image is a "likeness" under section 3344 must
be decided without reference to the context in which the image
appears. In concluding that White's claim failed, we stated
that we were not "deciding for all purposes when a caricature
or impressionistic resemblance might become a 'likeness.'" Id.
Thus, White is not controlling her.

     In White, the court determined that, although the robot
was not a "likeness" of the plaintiff, the context in which
the robot appeared created a material issue of fact as to
whether the defendants had appropriated the plaintiff's
identity within the meaning of the California common law right
of publicity. FN1 Id. at 1397-99. Hence, under section 3344,
whether the animatronic figures are likenesses of Wendt and
Ratzenberger must be determined without reference to the
familiar clothing and setting in which the figures appear.

     The district court compared photographs of plaintiffs
Wendt and Ratzenberger with photographs of the animatronic
figures and took "judicial notice" of the fact that the
figures were not identical to plaintiffs. This conclusion
appears to have been the basis of the district court's summary
judgment on the section 3344 claims. We need not determine
whether them district court's purported taking of judicial
notice was correct. Assuming that the facts judicially noticed
are true, the case is not at an end. The question here is
whether the three dimensional animatronic figures are
sufficiently similar to plaintiffs to constitute their
likeness. Based on the limited record before us, it cannot be
said as a matter of law that the figures are so dissimilar
from plaintiffs that no reasonable trier of fact could find
that them to be "likenesses." That question must be determined
by a comparison of the actual, three-dimensional entities.

                              IV

     As to the plaintiffs' common law right of publicity
claims, the parties dispute the correct legal standards to be
applied. We need not determine the exact reach of the law; we
conclude that even under the narrowest definition there is a
disputed issue of material fact.

     Appellees contend that the dress and setting in which the
animatronic figures appear invoke the characters "Norm" and
"Cliff," rather than the plaintiffs' identities as
individuals. Paramount argues that the "Norm" and "Cliff"
characters are its property, not part of plaintiffs'
identities protected under the right of publicity. Even if we
assume that this is correct, and we make no such holding, we
have already explained that the similarity between plaintiffs'
human physical characteristics and those of the figures is
sufficient to create a disputed issue of material fact.

                             V

     Plaintiffs' final substantive claim is for unfair
competition under section 43(a) the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C.
Section 1125(a)).

     In this situation, section 43(a) will provide a cause of
action for Wendt and Ratzenberger if Host's condition has
created a likelihood of confusion as to whether plaintiffs
were endorsing Host's product. White, 971 F.2d at 1399-1400.
There is a well settled eight factor test to be applied to
celebrity endorsement cases under section 43(a). Newton v.
Thomason, 22 F.3d 1455, 1462 (9th Cir. 1994).

     In light of our other holdings, it is sufficient to
observe that one of the primary factors to be considered is
the "similarity of the marks." Id. As there is a disputed
issue of material fact as to the similarity between plaintiffs
and the figures, summary judgment was inappropriate on this
claim.

                             VI

     Plaintiffs challenge the district court's ruling on a
motion in limine brought by Host. That ruling is not properly
before us at this time. The motion is not dispositive of the
case. We are remanding the case for trial, and have no way to
divine what the state of the record will be after the trial is
complete. We express no opinion on the propriety of the
district court's ruling.

Katherine J. Trager Vice President Deputy General Counsel

January 17, 1995 VIA FACSIMILE and AIRBORNE EXPRESS

Patricia D. Douglas, Esq. 1029 31st Street N.W. Washington, D.C. 20007

Re: Claim by Polly Nelson

Dear Ms. Douglas:

Your letter of December 30 has been referred to me for response and I
have reviewed it with John Grisham. While I understand you have
undertaken a very careful analysis of both your client's nonfiction
work, Defending the Devil: My Story as Ted Bundy's Last Lawyer (the
"Devil") and The Chamber by Mr. Grisham ("The Chamber"), there is no
factual or legal basis for the claims asserted in your letter.

First and most importantly, Mr. Grisham has never read the Devil.
Indeed, it would have been impossible for him to have read it before
writing The Chamber. The Devil was published on July 21, 1994. The
Chamber was on sale on May 25, 1994. Copies of The Chamber were in
production even earlier. Obviously, Mr. Grisham could not have copied
from a book which was not published until well after his book was
completed and on sale. At the end of your lengthy claim letter, you
appear to assert that Doubleday had an eighty page version of the
Devil and that "editors" met with Ms. Nelson and her agent at
Doubleday's offices on October 15, 1990. No one here at Doubleday
recalls such a meeting or proposal; if you wish, I will look into this
further, provided you can identify the editor and agent involved,
inform me as to whether or not the eighty page proposal was retained
at Doubleday or returned to your client and provide the proposal with
proof that it was written in 1990. In any event, there is not a shred
of evidence to support a claim that somehow Mr. Grisham obtained this
eighty page proposal and used this as the basis for The Chamber. Nor,
of course, does it in any way support the other forty pages of your
claim in which you cite alleged similarities between The Chamber and
the Devil. Thus, a claim based on the proposal could only be asserted
if you could establish that (i) Mr. Grisham had access to the proposal
and (ii) that there are substantial similarities of copyrightable
material between the proposal and The Chamber.

We, of course, have not seen the proposal and your letter does not
say, nor could it say, that the similarities you identify are all
present in the proposal as well as the finished version of the Devil.
Even aside from the logical problem with your claim, the comparisons
you identify between he Devil and The Chamber are not actionable under
basic fundamentals of copyright law.

First, facts and ideas within a work are not protected by copyright.
Harper & Row Publishers v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539, 54748
(1985); Gardner v. Nizer, 391 F.Supp. 940 (S.D.N.Y. 1975). The Devil
is a work of nonfiction. As described in the claim letter, it recounts
facts concerning the author's life and her experiences in representing
Ted Bundy. The fact that the author was a young lawyer when she took
the case, a graduate from a midwestern law school, that she went to
work for a major law firm, that she came from a poor background, etc.,
are all unprotectable facts. Anyone could write about those facts,
and, contrary to the assertion contained on page 1 of your letter, it
is perfectly permissible for someone to sit down and write a biography
of Polly Nelson and a description of the efforts she made to defend
Ted Bundy, using her book as its only source. See e.g. Walker v. Time
Life Films, Inc.. 784 F.2d 44 (2d Cir. 1986) affirming 615 F. Supp.
430 (S.D.N.Y. 1985), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1159 (1986), Hoehling v.
Universal City Studios, Inc., 618 F.2d 972 (2d Cir. 1980); Miller v.
Universal City Studios, Inc. 650 F.2d 1365 (5th Cir. 1981). Even if
your client's work were fictional, the claim asserted here would still
fail. It is well established that scenes a faire, ("sequences of
events which necessarily follow from a common theme,") are not
protectable. Reyher v. Children's Television Workshop, 533 F.2d 87, 91
(2d Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 980 (1976); Walker v. Time Life
Films. Inc,. supra 784 F.2d, at 48 (incidents, characters, or settings
that are indispensable or standard in the treatment of a given topic
are not copyrightable.) The many alleged similarities you cite are
common to lawyers and death penalty cases.

Without addressing all of these alleged similarities, it is sufficient
to just note a few, which establish that there is no basis for any
claim of copyright infringement here:

Both books involve young lawyers. Many young lawyers do pro-bono work
and many death penalty cases are done on a pro-bono basis. Frequently
the young lawyers who do these cases are employed by large law firms,
because those are the firms that can afford to have a lawyer spend the
unbillable hours involved in a pro-bono death penalty case.

Major law firms try to hire the best and the brightest law students
they can find. Therefore, it commonly follows that young lawyers
handling death penalty cases at major law firms would also tend to be
among the brighter students and members of law review. It is, of
course, well known that law review members often do get offers from
many law firms.

We can go on and on here. Many lawyers who do pro-bono work do
complain that others in the firm are not sympathetic to their work.
Often, the partner who is supervising an associate is cold and distant
and puts pressure on the young associate. These general similarities,
of course, apply to law firm practice in general and cannot possibly
be considered as protectable material of the plaintiff.

The comments concerning the other characters' similarities are
similarly generic and to the extent there is any resemblance between
such characters, it is a necessary consequence of the fact that such
characters and situations arise in death penalty cases and stories
about death penalty cases. It is well known, for example, that many
judges are impatient with the appeals made on behalf of death penalty
inmates. It is well known that some judges revel in press attention,
that law clerks let it be known that they do not appreciate
defendants' motions, and that death penalty counsel, like other
lawyers, do tell "war stories" to each other.

You make the somewhat disjointed infringement claim that Mr. Grisham's
fictional characters are composites of real people portrayed in your
client's book. For example, it is asserted that Hez Kerry "has his
genesis" in three real people, Mike Mellow, Mark Olive, and Jeff
Robinson. Even if it were true that Mr. Grisham based his character on
these three living people, there could hardly be any claim of
"copying" based upon a fictional character who coincidentally has one
or two characteristics which are common to each of three different
people.

The common developments in the "plot" of the Devil and The Chamber
also do not support any claim. Again, your client does not have any
protectable interest in facts and none of the facts concerning her
representation of Ted Bundy is protectable. Moreover, any similarity
in events in the Devil and The Chamber are common to many death
penalty cases. It is well known that death penalty cases receive lurid
press coverage; that lawyers become exhausted and resentful of the
extraordinary pace of the criminal justice system; that lawyers who
represent convicted murderers do have doubts about what they're doing;
that young lawyers do enjoy the luxury of a car paid for by the firm
and that lawyers do need to sometimes get up and leave their desks
when they are nervously awaiting a decision. Also, it is true that
news people do gather at executions without embarrassment and that
often, as a threatened execution approaches, inmates do make
confessions, and do exhibit vulnerability.

Aside from the similarities in "plot," you also make much of the
allegedly similar descriptions and word usages. But, the similarities
are so general, and involve such commonplace examples, that any claim
of copying must fall. That both characters stare at blank computer
screens; that a breeze chases away humidity, that the words
"typically" and "interminable" appear in both books, is of absolutely
no consequence. I could continue. I have examined the similarities
alleged in your tables. Again, such similarities, to the extent that
they even are similarities, must be coincidental; and even if they
were not, they simply do not support a claim of copyright infringement
because they are not substantially similar: see e.g. Narell v.
Freeman, 872 F.2d at 907, 16 Media Law Reporter 1579 (9th Cir. 1989);
Hoehling, 618 F.2d at 979 (random duplications of phrases not
infringement). (See, for example, this comparison from "Table K": The
Chamber, p. 433: "With his black hair, black beard, black glasses, and
black suit, [Dr. Swinn] indeed gave the appearance of an ominously
brilliant master of his field." The Devil, p. 208: "[O]nce on the
stand, Dr. Dorothy Lewis was brilliant- clear, convincing, articulate.
Resplendent in a deep purple suit, she illuminated the courtroom" Or,
because, again, they are so common: such as the claim in Table I that
both prisons had signs which identified them as respectively,
"Mississippi State Penitentiary" and "Florida State Prison."

Obviously, I could show that the foregoing is applicable to all the
claimed "infringements." But I believe this is sufficient to apprise
you of the facts that: 1) Mr. Grisham could not possibly have copied
your client's book because his book was finished and published long
before your client's was published; 2) to the extent that the claims
are based on facts in your client's book, such facts are not
protectable as a matter of law and 3) even if your client's work was
fictional, the alleged similarities between the two works either do
not exist or are so commonplace that they are not subject to copyright
protection.

I hope that you and your client will carefully analyze this response
before you take any further action in this matter. If this is pursued,
in view of the impossibility of the claim and its legal deficiencies,
I must advise you that Mr. Grisham and Doubleday will vigorously
defend the suit and will, of course, file a motion for attorney's fees
under 17 U.S.C. 505 and also under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure. Since your client is a lawyer, she should be aware of
these provisions, particularly the sanctions under Rule 11 against a
party who files a pleading that is frivolous.

In conclusion, I must also remind you and your client that Mr. Grisham
is a lawyer who has tried many cases, both criminal and civil. As
demonstrated by his books, Mr. Grisham has a sophisticated and broad
knowledge of the law, the judicial system, lawyers and law firms. As
stated in the Acknowledgments section of The Chamber, Mr. Grisham
spent many hours with lawyers involved on both sides of death penalty
cases and with prison personnel. Together with his creative mind, they
are the sources for The Chamber. This best-selling author hardly
needed to rely on your client's four-year old proposal to write a book
about the death penalty.

Very truly yours,

Katherine J. Trager

Re: The Chamber/Defending the Devil

Dear Sirs:

        I have been retained by Polly Nelson to prosecute
a claim for infringement of copyright and related claims
arising from publication of Mr. Grisham's novel The Chamber.
In The Chamber, Mr. Grisham has unlawfully appropriated the plot,
characters, descriptions, and personal introspection found in Ms.
Nelson's non-fiction book Defending the Devil: My Story as Ted
Bundy's Last Lawyer (Morrow, 1994; the "Devil"). By so doing,
Mr. Grisham has also wrongfully appropriated Ms. Nelson's
life story, which she was privileged to market for her
economic benefit.

It is immediately obvious on reading the two works that each
tells exactly the same story--the tale of a new lawyer in an
establishment law firm who, to meet her or his own personal
needs, volunteers to take on the representation of the
most notorious killer on death row. The inmate faces execution
within a few weeks. The young lawyer immediately becomes heavily
invested in the case, and struggles against the legal system
determined that the condemned inmate should die at the
scheduled hour. She and he must also contend with state politics;
the
politics of her/his law firm; a restless, marginally cooperative
client unwilling or unable to inspire a sympathetic response;
and relentless press efforts to sensationalize the story.
In the end, the client is executed, the politicians rejoice, and
the shattered lawyer immediately leaves the firm.

Below we set out at some length our preliminary analysis of some
of the striking similarities between the two books. As
attachments we include a side-by-side comparison of a number of
very similar passages. We have cited to specific page numbers of
each book to facilitate your review of our conclusions, except
when the bases for our observations are obvious. We have shared
our analysis in this depth in the hope that you will devote the
serious attention to our claim that will permit it to be
resolved short of litigation. Careful study of the points we
raise, which are certainly not all of those we would expect to
raise at trial, can lead to no other conclusion than that Mr.
Grisham in fact based his work on Ms. Nelson's book, blatantly
appropriating both grand themes and small details, and that his
attempts to disguise this appropriation will be readily exposed.

CHARACTERS

Most of the characters appearing in The Chamber, major and minor,
have direct counterparts in the Devil. In many other cases,
either traits of one character in the Devil are split between
two characters in The Chamber, or one character in The Chamber
takes on traits of two or more characters in the Devil. Several
examples follow:

The Young Lawyer Protagonist. In The Chamber, Adam Hall is a
newly graduated lawyer, the editor of his Midwestern law
school's law review, who has been working for nine months at a
prosperous, business-oriented, metropolitan law firm. In the
Devil,
Polly Nelson is a newly graduated lawyer, the editor of her
Midwestern law school's law review, who has been working for
three months at a prosperous, business-oriented, metropolitan
law firm. Each protagonist earns a healthy professional salary
but chooses, from inertia or emotional vacuum, to live in
surroundings unequal to her/his status in life (a converted
warehouse/skin care salon), too paralyzed by the demands of
their work at the high-pressure law firm to look for a new place
to live. FN 1 Neither has a sex life, or any personal life at
all. Both
plan to work at the law firm for only a couple of years and then
move on to do what they really want to do. FN 2
Both take on--as the first case for which they take primary
responsibility--the cause of defending an inmate sentenced to
death in a Southern state.

Each is simultaneously naive and dedicated. Both come from modest
backgrounds and are openly awed at the travel and fringe
benefits provided by their law firms. FN 3 Both grew up feeling
overly responsible, due to dependent and "unhappy" parents; both
were "born" to represent this particular inmate. FN 4 Each
confesses to being excited/intoxicated by the life-and death
nature of the case. FN 5 Neither can believe that her/his law
firm is not wholly supportive of all necessary efforts to halt
the execution. FN 6

Both young lawyers struggle to regard their clients with sympathy
and to avoid thinking about the crimes for which they face
execution. Despite these efforts, Adam and Polly cannot help but
feel empathy for the ethnic/gender group
the inmate targeted for murder, both suffer intermittent bouts of
internal rage directed at the inmate and wonder if they should
be representing him. FN 7 Neither feels he/she can give up on
the case. Both fight through a haze of exhaustion to save
the inmate's life, and both lose. Neither attends the execution.
Both become disillusioned about the law; the relationship
between each and his/her law firm deteriorates badly. Both
unhappily leave their firms promptly after the execution. FN 8

Both Adam and Polly feel a moral calling--even a compulsion--to
represent the condemned inmate, a calling they only
superficially understand at the outset, a calling that appears,
at least at first, to conflict with their best interests. FN 9
The gradual illumination of this calling provides a plot running
parallel to the prisoner's steady march towards execution.
Polly has other dimensions, however, that Mr. Grisham has
displaced onto the character of Lee Cayhall Booth. Both Lee and
Pol-lee are alcoholics who are at risk of relapse under the
emotional burden of the pending execution. FN 10 Both are also
compulsive social workers, seeking gratification from the belief
that others need them. FN 11

The Prosperous Law Firm Employing the Protagonist. Kravitz & Bane
and Wilmer
Cutler & Pickering both advertise a commitment to pro bono work,
which is one reason the protagonists, with many offers to choose
from, landed at those firms. FN 12 It turns out that this
commitment is sorely tested when the pro bono case taken on by
a young associate becomes an all-consuming, very expensive,
very public crusade to halt the execution of the nation's most
despised villain. FN 13 Most partners at the firm are late in
learning that the firm in fact has taken on this notorious case;
when they learn of it, they see it as an unpalatable burden
about which nothing can be done. FN 14 In both firms, those
partners who direct associates in pro bono projects apparently
have limited ability or desire to protect them from the
resentment and retaliation of other, less generous partners. FN 15
For example, Daniel Rosen plays the same role in The Chamber as
do the insurance partner who is angry at Polly for neglecting his
work and the
unnamed managing partner who ultimately fires her. FN 16 All
three of these partners come to believe that the protagonist has
come to the firm only to exploit its support for pro bono work.
FN 17
Both firms reluctantly expend grand sums (in excess of $2 million
in The Chamber and $1.5 million in the Devil) on this one case.
FN 18

The Partner Supervising the Protagonist. Each protagonist is
nominally supervised and supported by a partner with pro bono
and death penalty experience. Both Garner Goodman and Jim
Coleman are cool, wise and dependable, managing to stay aloof
and detached from the emotional fray attendant on an impending
execution. Each also seems to stand somewhat apart from his
partners at the firm, limiting his practice to pro bono matters,
or at least supervising more such cases than other partners. FN 19
Each stays in the background of the inmate's case as much as
possible and actively participates only as an execution date
draws near. FN 20 Neither takes the pressure off the young
protagonist to
any significant extent, and spends time being chummy with the
death penalty community. FN 21 This partner and the young lawyer
have a formal, distant, respectful relationship, free of
disagreements but also free of any real emotional connection.
FN 22

The Condemned Inmate. Both Sam and Ted are the most famous and
notorious inmates on death row, the perpetrators of several
unmitigated and grisly murders, convicted after more than one
well-publicized trial. Both have murdered multiple, innocent
victims. Neither is expected to escape execution.

Each inmate has represented himself and fired his lawyers. Each
has and has had great difficulty ceding control of his case to
his counsel. Each is clever enough to write long, overblown
legal papers and condescendingly quizzes his lawyers by throwing
out the names of precedent-setting death penalty cases. FN 23
Although both Sam and Ted know that their new lawyers are
inexperienced, they also know that they were very successful law
students and come with the backing and resources of a
prestigious,
large law firm. FN 24 Both young lawyers conclude that the
inmate is in fact not as clever as he thinks he is and that, on
the contrary, each inmate has been and remains potentially a
danger to his own cause. FN 25 In both cases the lawyer presses
an incompetency claim that the inmate thinks is nonsense. FN 26

In the midst of the countdown toward execution, each inmate is
stubborn about minor details of prison procedures and is adamant
about his exercise privileges. FN 27 For example, on a rare
excursion off death row, each, although facing imminent execution,
is angry and obsessed about the comfort/safety conditions
in the van in which he is riding. FN 28

Each inmate is largely ignored by family and friends. FN 29 Each
goes into a ``trance'' when the lawyer asks the hard questions
about his crimes. FN 30
Toward the end, each inmate plans to make a complete confession,
but warns that it will take a long time because there is so much
to confess and it is so deeply buried. FN 31 Each ultimately
admits there were additional victims, previously unknown.
FN 32 Each urges the lawyer to believe he is not the sort of
person to hurt anyone. FN 33 It is difficult, despite twinges of
sympathy, not to conclude that both Ted and Sam are profoundly
evil men.

Sam and Ted, although of different generations, are described in
remarkably similar physical terms, as seen in Table A, attached.

The Judges. Both Adam and Polly are resigned to the fact that the
state courts will reject any claims they might bring. Both
naively place their faith in the federal district courts, and
are severely disappointed. FN 34 District Court Judge Slattery/
Zloch is a recent Reagan appointee who is facing his first death
case. FN 35 Judge Slattery/Sharp works all hours to prepare for
the case, impatiently calling the lawyers to demand filings in
advance. FN 36 He denies all claims, taking care to avoid
grounds for reversal by a pro forma review of the record. FN 37

The judges/their law clerks informally make known their
displeasure with defense claims, even in advance of their
filing. FN 38 The judges revel in press attention, FN 39 and seem
to be cozy
with the prosecutors in a manner that does not signal success
for the inmate's case. FN 40 The judges set hearings with so
little notice that the lawyers must rush across the state to get
to a suddenly scheduled hearing. FN 41 Yet the judges also feel
free to protect their leisure activities from interference
from this case. FN 42 In both books, the judges let the lawyers
put on extensive testimony about the inmate's mental competency
only out of fear of being reversed on appeal. FN 43

Allied Counsel. In both books, the protagonist receives a modicum
of support by lawyers specializing in defeating imposition of
the death penalty. In The Chamber that support comes from Hez
Kerry, a young black lawyer who has renounced big firm life
and who now heads a Southern anti-death-penalty group. FN 44
Kerry has his genesis in several of Nelson's characters--Mike
Mello, a lawyer with an anti-death-penalty group in Florida;
Mark Olive, the chief litigator for the same group; and Jeff
Robinson, a young black Wilmer associate who has successfully
taken
on a previous death penalty case, who gets Polly into the case,
and who leaves the firm soon thereafter for public service. FN
45

Opposing Counsel. Both Adam and Polly face lawyers for the state
who are far more experienced and are death zealots. They also
seem to appear in droves. FN 46

Supporting Characters. The following characters appear in both
books:

The calm, laid-back guard, specializing in handling the
condemned, who is solicitous of the inmate and the lawyer. FN 47

The corrections officials and personnel who will be disappointed
if a stay is granted. FN 48

Governors and attorneys general seeking political benefit from
the inmate's death, e.g., posturing on TV to show how hard they
will work to make sure the inmate is put to death. FN 49

A pathetic and insane white inmate who corresponds with Sam/Ted.
FN 50

The experienced and rough-talking former investigator who
alternatively despises and understands the inmate, and who
thinks the young lawyer is naive about the extent of his evil.
FN 51

A young secretary (Dara or Darlene), not the young lawyer's
regular secretary, described as working long hours, excited by
her role in this notorious case, and very competent. FN 52

The evangelical preacher who gains the inmate's respect. FN 53

The eccentric psychiatrists testifying for the defense. FN 54

Family members who have withdrawn from the inmate. Neither Ted's
wife Carole Boone nor Sam's daughter Lee Cayhall Booth comes to
see the inmate before the execution, but both Ted and Sam
pretend to understand this. FN 55 Both inmates have a younger
brother who never comes to visit and does his best to withdraw
from the inmate and the execution. FN 56 In both books the
inmates have an elderly aunt who calls him her "favorite nephew"
yet does not visit. FN 57

Family members of the young lawyer who keep their distance from
the case. Both protagonists have mothers who live in a distant
state, with whom they talk on the telephone. FN 58 Each
protagonist has a sibling who flies in for a visit during the
case. FN 59

In sum, each of the important people in Ms. Nelson's book has a
counterpart in Mr. Grisham's--from the lawyer and inmate, right
on through the judges, other lawyers, relatives, correctional
officials, secretaries and politicians.

PLOT

Each book is the story of an unsuccessful attempt by an
inexperienced young lawyer to save a notorious condemned
murderer from the death penalty. In each, the execution
approaches at a steady, relentless pace, despite frantic legal
efforts by the protagonist to avoid it. In each, the inmate moves
from stoicism,
to manic activity, to fear, to a sort of dignified acceptance.
In each, the protagonist moves from naive idealism, to
awkwardness, to hope, to doubt, to introspection, to
overwhelming fatigue and frustration, to disgust at the passion of
the public,
press and judicial establishment to see the inmate executed, to
aggravation at the inmate himself, to a last-minute glimmer of
intimacy with the inmate and to numb disorientation following
his death. For example, both books share the following
subplots and themes:

The young lawyer explores his or her personal reasons for taking
on this case for this client, and gains a measure of self-
knowledge by the end of the book. FN 60

Both lawyers are exhausted by and resentful of the extraordinary
pace at which the criminal justice system requires counsel to
conduct post-conviction death penalty litigation. Each is
convinced that the courts to which they are appealing for relief
simply want to ensure that the execution goes ahead as
scheduled, without any stays. FN 61

Both cases receive lurid press coverage, including constant re-
caps of old news about the inmate and his crimes. The reporters,
both local and national, aggressively seek interviews with the
lawyer and with the inmate. The lawyer vacillates at times,
but ultimately learns how to handle aggressive press
attention. FN 62

Both Sam and Ted are depicted as mentally tortured by the
uncertainty of the death penalty appeal process. FN 63

In both books the inmate has two things he wants to accomplish at
the end of his life: (1) publicly to denounce one of the causal
factors of his crimes (the Klan/violent pornography), and (2)
to confess to all his crimes, even those not charged. Sam
springs the Klan letter on Adam while they are awaiting a
decision by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, following their
only evidentiary hearing, which dealt with Sam's competency to
be executed. Ted springs the confession scheme on Polly while
they are awaiting a decision by
the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, following their only
evidentiary hearing, which dealt with Ted's competency to be
tried. In both books, the inmate's plans threaten the pending
appeal, and the lawyer attempts to control the inmate in his
public statements. In neither case is the lawyer wholly
successful. FN 64

The following events are among those that advance the plot and
these sub-plots in both books:

The protagonist's experiences and feelings:

On first receiving a call from/entering the prison, Polly and
Adam both wonder if the operator/guard is having any reaction
upon hearing the famous inmate's name. FN 65

On the occasion of her/his first contact with the prison, Polly
and Adam encounter a prison official who checks up on her/his
identity and informs her/him that more lawyer access than usual
is permitted in the case of an inmate facing imminent execution.
At the same time, the lawyer is told of/notes the
conflicting emotions experienced by prison personnel who must
deal with inmates on a daily basis and then execute them. FN 66

Both young lawyers need to hear the inmate himself describe the
crimes to them. FN 67

Upon viewing a realistic artistic portrayal (sculpture/movie),
the lawyer struggles with her/his sympathy for and strong
identification with the victims, and sudden overwhelming hate
for the client. The lawyer feels guilt and disgust at
her/himself
for representing this evil man. FN 68

Both are abruptly confronted by partners in the home office while
an execution is imminent, warning them that their jobs are in
jeopardy because of their singleminded pursuit of the inmate's
case. Both are astounded that the partners are not instead
offering assistance and support. Neither has any sympathy for
the law firm's point of view. FN 69

Both are suddenly forced to fly back to the home office of the
law firm while the clock is ticking toward execution. Both
immediately return the next day. FN 70

The lawyer is shown to be as vulnerable as anyone else to the
type of violence suffered by the inmate's victims, as the lawyer
is/imagines being stalked by a killer. Neither incident affects
the relentless forward march of the story line, and neither
lawyer is ever confronted by any real personal danger. FN 71

The paralyzed young lawyer, still at the office at 8 p.m., gazes
out of the office windows into darkness. FN 72

Unwelcome words become soothing when spoken with a southern
drawl. FN 73

Both young lawyers avoid reviewing evidence of the inmate's
crimes as long as they can. FN 74

Both Polly and Adam delight in the luxury of a car paid for by
the firm. FN 75 In each book an experienced, empathetic lawyer
walks the young lawyer to and admires that car. FN 76

Polly and Adam, in a vacation environment, feel sad that the
inmate will never enjoy such experiences. FN 77

Goodman/Coleman & Polly stay in a small, quaint lodging house
offering a taste of luxury and refinement during their down-and-
dirty fight in the last days before the execution. FN 78

Both Adam and Polly need to break out of the stifling atmosphere
of their offices as the tension mounts waiting for the ruling of
the Circuit Court of Appeals. See Table B.

Both Adam and Polly wistfully envy ordinary people unencumbered
by the great burden of saving a man from execution. See Table C.
They are struck by the carefree demeanor of well-dressed locals
on the street and in restaurants going on with their ordinary
lives. FN 79 See Table C.

People get little sleep, people and briefs are rushed to the
airport, meals are gulped or postponed, and lawyers check into
hotels or board airplanes without clean clothes. FN 80 But every
once in a while the lawyer gets a respite, a quiet meal in a
nice restaurant, where there is no talk of the inmate's case.
FN 81

In the last days before a scheduled execution, Goodman/Polly go
shopping for a respite from the pressure, and become giddy with
a frivolous purchase/thought of a purchase. FN 82

Both Adam and Polly get a sudden break in the demands on them on
the Sunday two days before a scheduled execution. They get a
full night's sleep and get to flip through newspapers
(assiduously avoiding stories about their own case) and drink
coffee
at leisure, but the peace is subject to disruption at any
moment. FN 83

Adam and Polly are assaulted and repelled by the excitement of
the citizens at the imminence of the execution. FN 84 They are
disgusted as crowds outside the prison jeer and chant. FN 85
The young lawyer is shocked by photographs/news footage of people
gathered to celebrate a lynching/the execution, without
embarrassment. FN 86

Neither young lawyer lets her/himself believe that the execution
will in fact take place. FN 87

Both lawyers experience the aftermath of the execution as time
playing games or not moving forward. The lawyer is/feels hung
over. See Table D.

Obstacles in the way of the protagonist's efforts:

The state
where the inmate is jailed is competing with other states to be
the one with the most executions. FN 88

Law firm personnel act coolly toward Adam/Polly to express their
displeasure with the firm's representation of this notorious
inmate. FN 89

While staying at a motel, both lawyers are bombarded by
television reports concerning the client's imminent execution,
with accompanying political posturing. See Table E.

Jewish/Women partners of the prosperous law firm object to the
representation because the inmate killed Jews/women. See Table .

Assorted pundits (most often the press or state attorneys) quote
odds on the execution going forward at various points, as if
it's all a game. FN 90

Governor/Judges exhibit southern courtesy, while denying relief.
FN 91

Adam/Polly hurriedly backs away at a restaurant from a persistent
reporter from The New York Times/Life magazine who wants to
interview the inmate. FN 92

Both inmates recognize that the press keeps replaying the "same
old rehash/thing," but feel public excitement growing as the
execution nears. FN 93

In both books, judges disdain psychiatrists who attempt to help
inmates avoid the death penalty. FN 94

The inmate's experiences and feelings:

The inmate eventually comes to enjoy talking about his crimes,
and does so in a chillingly methodical way. After a
pause/hemming and hawing, he goes into a "trance," remembers
every detail, and seems to admire his own skill. The inmate
describes and
analyzes the details fondly, without consideration for how cold-
blooded it makes him look or how it repulses the young lawyer.
FN 95

Both inmates feign paranoia about being doped by prison
authorities to make the execution go smoothly. FN 96

Both inmates stubbornly refuse to make last requests while there
is any hope for a stay. FN 97

Both inmates are aggressively approached to sell their stories.
FN 98

The inmate is unnerved upon hearing prison personnel make
physical preparations for the execution. FN 99

Both inmates balk at describing one particular murder to a
minister. FN 100

Each inmate shows his vulnerability and pleads with his lawyer
only once. Sam pleads with Adam not to file hopeless last-minute
claims, including one asserting that he is incompetent to be
executed, because he wants to die with dignity. Ted pleads with
Polly to file a hopeless last-minute claim that he is
incompetent to be executed, but Polly convinces him to die with
dignity instead. FN 101

Silence signals meaningful communication between the lawyer and
his client near the end. There is nothing appropriate to say.
The inmate has retreated to an unknowable, private place. FN 102

Both lawyers will tell the inmate anything he wants to hear at
the end, when the inmate shows genuine emotion about his
personal relationships. FN 103

Case events:

Both inmates had been identified by a witness who came forward
only after the defendant had been indicted and his face had been
prominently featured in the press. FN 104

The young lawyer is excited when she/he realizes that a witness
who was never called to testify at trial may have evidence that
will exonerate the inmate, or otherwise diminish his
culpability. In each case, the missing witness had supposedly
spotted
the inmate/the victim at a truck stop. In each case the
protagonist wants badly to believe in the worth of this
testimony, but is firmly disabused of his hope by the inmate. FN
105

Unlike the competency claim, the inmate is enthusiastic about the
first major ground for reversal put forth by the lawyer, and
eagerly offers to help with legal research. FN 106

Adam/Polly seeks out a former investigator on the case, hoping he
will provide helpful information. That investigator takes
control of the interview and provides cryptic information both
reinforcing and mitigating the inmate's culpability. FN 107

Law students have a ball working on both cases. FN 108

During the competency hearing, the judge interrupts the testimony
once to ask his own question, apparently out of sheer
curiosity. FN 109

Both Ted and Sam are curious when they see on television a young
black lawyer they have never met, who is part of the defense
team, explaining what the defense team is up to. FN 110

At one point, the state's lawyers and the inmate's lawyers appear
to share the sense that they are being caught up in ridiculous
time limits, and the state's lawyers graciously offer their
facilities to counsel for the inmate. A fancy phone system is
required for the expedited decision from the Circuit Court of
Appeals, which all the lawyers recognize is simply going through
the motions. The inmate's appeal is denied virtually instantly
the same afternoon. FN 111

On the night before the execution, Adam and Polly are both called
out of their last "huddled" meeting with the inmate to take a
telephone call from the supervising partner, who is monitoring
the last possibility for saving the inmate's life. FN 112

Parallel gratuitous details:

Both law firms have Christmas parties, mentioned in passing. FN
113

Lee and Polly focus on the physical details of the victims'
deaths and, at least momentarily, declare legal niceties
superfluous. FN 114

Many other death row residents have been waiting for their
executions longer than have Sam or Ted FN 115, and the
warden/allied counsel is already thinking ahead with dread to
the next execution after Sam/Ted. FN 116

The lawyer's family members get to follow the course of events in
the press due to extensive, nationwide publicity, but do not
actively offer support. FN 117

Professional death penalty lawyers bolster their confidence by
telling war stories with their fellows. FN 118

DESCRIPTIONS

Many descriptive passages in the two books are so strikingly
similar that copying by Mr. Grisham is the only rational
explanation.

One example is when the young lawyer drives toward the prison and
meets the condemned inmate for the first time. Both Adam and
Polly feel not "particularly . . .welcome"/"unwelcome" and
drive cautiously past "ramshackle" buildings, numbed by their
cars' sound systems. See Table G. The lawyer suddenly feels
reluctant to proceed toward the prison after reading a sign
indicating that the prison is five/six miles ahead. FN 119 Each
lawyer's shoes become a focal point as she/he awaits clearance
through
prison security procedures. FN 120 The young lawyer is surprised
at the large size of the room in which he/she first meets the
inmate. FN 121 In both cases the lawyer is nervous, but reminds
him/herself that he/she is up to the job at hand given the
"formidable" resources of the large law firm. FN 122 Each lawyer
has
great difficulty looking her/his new client in the eye, and each
is surprised at how short, thin and pale the prisoner is. See
Table H.

The following are some additional examples:

The young lawyer and the supervising partner sit together in
silence in a rare shared moment after receiving bad news and
realizing the struggle ahead. FN 123

Both inmates are described as stubbornly keeping secret the truth
about their crimes because of an oath or vow made to others as
well as to themselves. FN 124

The prison entrance is announced by an arched sign. See Table I.
Both young lawyers are blinded by the brilliant midday sun
outside the prison. FN 125

In both books, barbed wire is described as "razor wire," and
particularly as "gleaming" razor wire. FN 126

The protagonist looks out another lawyer's window to see the
rooftops of nearby buildings. FN 127

Lee and Polly sink low into sofas. FN 128

"Bulky" legal files are maintained by the inmate. FN 129

The physical description of Todd Marks copies that of Mark Olive.
See Table J.

Conversation between the lawyer and the investigator/psychiatrist
with insight into the inmate's criminal nature is made
impossible by the roar of a motor. FN 130

A breeze chases away humidity. FN 131

Both Adam and Polly "stare" at a "blank computer screen." FN 132

The primary defense psychiatrist is described as completely
incapable of/bypassing small talk. FN 133

Expert psychiatrists gain credibility from talking
differently/having an accent, traveling great distances, and
illuminating the courtroom by the color of their clothes. See
Table K.

WORD USAGE

Mr. Grisham must have seen and studied Ms. Nelson's manuscript of
the Devil before completing The Chamber. There is no other
rational explanation for the striking similarities in plot,
character, and description that we have set out above. As
additional evidence, however, we have discovered Polly Nelson's
"literary fingerprints" throughout The Chamber in Mr. Grisham's
use of her distinctive words and phrases.

First, many distinctive word combinations or phrases appear in
both The Chamber and Defending the Devil, but cannot be found
anywhere in the four novels published previously by Mr. Grisham.
We've listed a few of them in Table L. We continue to find
more examples.

In addition, certain individual words used in the Devil also
appear in The Chamber but apparently not in any other Grisham
novel. There appear to be scores if not hundreds of examples of
this phenomenon. Some are very telling, common words, the
repetitive use of which constitutes an integral stylistic habit
that
signals a particular authorship. For example, the word
"typically" appears seven times in the Devil and nine times in
The Chamber. The word has never been used by Mr. Grisham in any
of his other published novels.

Other words are so uncommon as to preclude the likelihood that
their appearance for the first time in this, Mr. Grisham's fifth
novel is coincidental. Among these are "pesky, "chirpy,''
"scruffy," "ruckus", "slinky", "interminable," "inundate,"
"quipped", "steely," "reverberate," "glint," "forsaken,"
"pristine," and
"wistfully." All of these (and many others) appear in both the
Devil and The Chamber, and apparently not in any prior Grisham
novel.

IMMATERIALITY OF DISTINCTIVE ELEMENTS

We are mindful, of course, that The Chamber employs certain story
lines not present in Defending the Devil. None of these
distinctive elements, however, is an integral part of Mr.
Grisham's book and most, on closer analysis, turn out not to be
"distinctive" at all.

For example, Rollie Wedge stalks Lee and Adam, and comes to
threaten Sam. Yet
nothing becomes of this subplot--Wedge simply vanishes, and the
protagonist Adam never even knows that he may have been in
danger. Wedge's return and his menacing actions thus have no
effect whatsoever on Mr. Grisham's story. It turns out that the
explanation for this narrative lapse is a simple one--Mr. Grisham
is copying an incident where Polly Nelson imagines that she is
being stalked at the death penalty conference. FN 134 Since
Polly's stalker is an imaginary one (and, thus, can have no
impact on the events of her nonfiction account), Mr. Grisham's
copycat stalker plot line likewise can have no impact on his
novel. So too with other diversionary parts of Mr. Grisham's
story such as Lee. Booth's relentless social work, her alcoholic
relapse, and her retreat into a recovery program. These events in
no way advance Mr. Grisham's story, and in fact distract from it
and lead nowhere. They are, of course, simply a thinly disguised
version of the real life story of Polly Nelson.

Finally, the fact that Adam is Sam's grandson--what might be
urged as the most striking difference between the two books--is
in fact another, central parallel. Just as Adam is called to
understand and defend his grandfather (and thus understand his
family, his upbringing and himself), Polly too is irresistibly
driven by her unhappy family relationships to undertake the
career-destroying and hopeless task of defending a "worm" such
as Ted Bundy. Adam's defense of his grandfather Sam is surely
derived from the central theme of Polly's book "I was born to
represent Ted Bundy."

THE CHAMBER IS WHOLLY UNLIKE ANY PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED GRISHAM
NOVEL

That Mr. Grisham copied Ms. Nelson's book is further established
by a comparison of The Chamber with the other published works of
Mr. Grisham. As the reviewers have recognized, and as we are
prepared to demonstrate by expert testimony, The Chamber is
a very different book than any previously associated with Mr.
Grisham.

ACCESS

After receiving an 80-page version of the Devil (then named
peace, ted), Doubleday editors met with Ms. Nelson and her agent
at Doubleday's offices on October 15, 1990, to discuss her book
proposal in expansive detail. Of course Ms. Nelson submitted
her proposal and participated in such a meeting only on the
premise that Doubleday would not publish her story without
compensation and credit to her.

RESOLUTION

We have written this letter only after careful analysis of the
facts and the available legal remedies. We will, of course,
carefully consider any evidence that you may wish to submit that
points to conclusions other that those set out above.
This letter's purpose is to avoid litigation, if that is
possible. We have addressed it to Doubleday and Mr. Grisham, but
we urge you to share it with other potentially affected parties
such as the purchasers of the movie rights, foreign rights, etc.
We are informed by press accounts that The Chamber was sold to
Universal Studios in the summer of 1993 for a substantial sum.
We are unaware of the current status of any motion picture based
on Mr. Grisham's book but feel constrained to state that
release of a motion picture based on The Chamber without
concomitant compensation and credit to Ms. Nelson is
unacceptable.

This letter notifies you of our claim and demands that you desist
from all infringing activities. Please be advised that we
require you to retain any and all potentially relevant evidence.
We will take the position that the loss or destruction of any
potentially relevant evidence after receipt of this notice is
evidence of liability, evidence of bad faith, and an act
designed to obstruct justice.

I look forward to discussing with you, or your representatives,
the terms under which we might compromise this claim. We will be
required to seek judicial redress if we do not hear from you
within the next two weeks.

Sincerely,



Patricia D. Douglass

CONTROVERSY

7. This action is for a declaratory judgment pursuant
to 28 U.S.C.  2201, there being a substantial actual controversy
within the jurisdiction of this court now existing between the
parties. Plaintiffs are interested parties and require deter-
minations and declarations by this Court of their rights with
respect to said controversy.

A. Plaintiffs' FASHION CAFE Restaurant And Trademark Rights

8. Plaintiff Tommaso Buti is a restauranteur who, in
1993, through a corporation owned by him, adopted and used the
name and service mark FASHION CAFE in connection with an Italian
restaurant and restaurant services in the South Beach area of
Miami Beach, Florida. The name FASHION CAFE was chosen by
Plaintiff Buti in order to identify the restaurant with South
Beach is flourishing modeling industry and to capitalize on
Plaintiffs' associations with the fashion industry. The FASHION
CAFE restaurant in Florida has an Italian theme and became popular
and received considerable press. Annexed hereto as Exhibit 1 is
a copy of the menu for the Florida FASHION CAFE restaurant.
Annexed hereto as Exhibit 2 are copies of articles from 1993 and
1994 reporting on the Florida FASHION CAFE restaurant.

9. In June of 1994, Plaintiff Buti commenced plans to
open a franchise of theme restaurants based on the fashion and
modeling industry which would include fashion related motifs and
displays of fashion memorabilia, under the name and service mark
FASHION CAFE. From its inception, the concept of the FASHION CAFE
theme restaurant was to offer American cuisine in each restaurant
and to also offer for sale souvenir merchandise bearing the
FASHION CAFE logo. The premier FASHION CAFE restaurant opened in
New York City on April 7, 1995.

10. From September 1994 to the present, Plaintiffs
Tommaso Buti and Fashion World Company embarked upon a promotional
campaign for the opening of a restaurant under the service mark
and trade name FASHION CAFE. The campaign announcing the opening
of Plaintiffs' New York FASHION CAFE restaurant has received
worldwide press coverage. The promotional campaign has been lead
by the internationally famous fashion supermodels Claudia
Schiffer, Elle Macpherson and Naomi Campbell, each of whom have an
interest in the franchising of FASHION CAFE restaurants.
Publicity concerning the April opening of the restaurant has
appeared in articles directed to the general public in newspapers
and magazines including the Boston Herald, Women's Wear Daily, New
York's Daily News, Vogue, The Detroit Free Press, The Star,
Italy's La Republica and London's Evening Standard. Copies of
press clippings from various newspapers and magazines regarding
Plaintiffs' FASHION CAFE are annexed hereto as Exhibit 3.

11. Part of the campaign included an official ground
breaking ceremony in early December 1994, featuring the three
famous supermodels that was aired on television news and talk
shows, on every major network as well as on cable networks
including but not limited to WNBC's "Live At Five" news program,
the evening news on the WNBC, WABC, WCBS, WPIX and WNYW (Fox)
networks, "Prime News" on Cable News Network and "Week in Review"
on E! Entertainment TV.

12. The premier New York City FASHION CAFE is located
in Rockefeller Center Plaza. Future sites for franchises of the
FASHION CAFE restaurant are being planned for the Far East
including Japan and Hong Kong, London and South America. Negoti-
ations concerning franchises are current and ongoing. Plaintiffs
have invested over $5,000,000 dollars in the opening.

13. In order to assure that Plaintiff Buti would be
able to continue to use the FASHION CAFE trademark for a theme
restaurant in the United States, Plaintiff Buti conducted a
trademark search in August of 1994. The search did not uncover
any use or registration of the mark FASHION CAFE by Defendant nor
any other entity or individual. Based thereon, Plaintiff Buti
filed a United States trademark application which was assigned
Serial No. 74/569,511 in the United States Patent and Trademark
Office, on September 2, 1994, for the service mark/trademark
FASHION CAFE for restaurant services and clothing. A copy of the
official filing receipt for this application is annexed hereto as
Exhibit 4.

14. After the logo was developed for the restaurant,
Plaintiff Buti filed another United States trademark application
which was assigned Serial No. 74/619,500 on January 10, 1995, for
the service mark/trademark FASHION CAFE & Design for restaurant
services and clothing. A copy of the official filing receipt for
this application is annexed hereto as Exhibit 6.

15. The name of the Florida FASHION CAFE restaurant was
changed in December 1994 in order for the FASHION CAFE restau-
rants, to be operated by Plaintiff Fashion World Company, to
maintain a single identity in terms of the theme, decor and food.
The Florida restaurant is now called FASHION ON THE BEACH and
continues to offer Italian cuisine in an Italian bistro setting.

B. Defendant's Actions That
Caused This Controversy

16. In a letter dated January 19, 1995, from
Defendant's attorney, Defendant asserts a claim that Plaintiffs'
use of FASHION CAFE for its New York restaurant is infringing
Defendant's trademark rights and is violating the unfair
competition laws of the "Lanham Act and the Trademark Law Revision
Act", by using the name FASHION CAFE for its restaurant and
allegedly "employ[ing] many of the themes utilized at
[Defendant's] original 'Fashion Cafe'" in Milan, Italy. The
particular themes are not identified in the letter. Defendant
further alleges that its "Fashion Cafe" in Milan is "world-
renowned", that Defendant was "contacted concerning a license of
its trademark for a New York franchise of [Defendant's]
restaurant" and that Defendant would suffer "irreparable harm and
consumer confusion" if Plaintiffs were to use the mark FASHION
CAFE for its restaurant. Defendant further demands that
Plaintiffs discontinue use of the mark FASHION CAFE and indicates
that Defendant would take "all necessary legal actions to protect
[Defendant's] rights, including seeking injunctive relief,
compensatory and punitive damages and attorney's fees." A copy of
Defendant's January 19, 1995 letter is annexed hereto as
Exhibit 6.

17. After corresponding with counsel for Defendant in
an attempt to settle the claims asserted by Defendant, Plaintiffs'
counsel received a letter from Defendant's counsel dated February
21, 1995, indicating that Defendant's counsel was "working with
[his] client to set forth his understanding of the [settlement]
proposal." Nevertheless, Plaintiffs were to "remain on notice to
cease and desist from infringing the rights of and unfairly
competing with [Defendant]." Annexed hereto as Exhibit 7 is a
copy of the February 21, 1995 letter.

18. Plaintiffs' FASHION CAFE restaurant opened on April
7, 1995, as scheduled. Thereafter, in the April 27, 1995 issue of
the Italian magazine Panorama, Defendant, through its owner, again
asserted that it had plans to sue Plaintiffs. Annexed hereto as
Exhibit 8 is a copy of the article that was published in the April
27, 1995 issue of Panorama.

C. Harm To Plaintiffs From Defendant's Threatened Action

19. Plaintiffs have expended enormous time, effort and
money in advertising, promoting and designing its new FASHION CAFE
restaurant which opened with great fanfare in Rockefeller Plaza
Center less than two months ago. Also, merchandise including
jackets and other clothing bearing the FASHION CAFE logo have been
manufactured and are being sold in the New York FASHION CAFE
restaurant.

20. Contrary to the assertions of Defendant, Defendant
has established no rights to the FASHION CAFE mark in the United
States under federal or common law, that would entitle Defendant
to assert trademark infringement or unfair competition claims in
the United States. Defendant has not filed an application nor
registered the trademark in the United States, nor has Defendant
opened a restaurant or rendered restaurant services in the United
States. Plaintiffs believe that Defendant's "Fashion Cafe" bar in
Milan, Italy, is not famous or well-known to the consuming public
in the United States. Accordingly, Defendant cannot prove any
likelihood of confusion on the part of the consuming public, thus
rendering Plaintiffs free from any liability.

21. Plaintiffs are offering to franchise third parties
in locations outside of New York and have used the New York
opening of FASHION CAFE in April as a launching pad for their
franchise of FASHION CAFE restaurants. Accordingly, Plaintiffs
have begun to negotiate with third parties to open additional
restaurants and will be severely damaged and otherwise irreparably
harmed should Defendants continue to assert that Plaintiffs' usage
of the FASHION CAFE mark for its restaurant and other merchandise
violate its rights.

22. Defendant has threatened to seek an injunction and
refuses to withdraw its claims of infringement and unfair
competition. For this reason, a substantial justiciable
controversy now exists because Plaintiffs and Defendant have real,
immediate and adverse interests based on Defendant's direct threat
of imminent litigation including Defendant's threat that it shall
seek injunctive relief.

23. The claims of trademark infringement and unfair
competition by Defendant against Plaintiffs will cause
considerable injury to Plaintiffs because of the substantial
investment by Plaintiffs in the FASHION CAFE restaurant and shall
interfere with Plaintiffs' business including plans for fran-
chising the FASHION CAFE restaurants which are presently in
negotiation. For all of the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs
will suffer immediate irreparable harm if Plaintiffs are unable to
establish that Defendant has no right to assert claims of
infringement and unfair competition based on the FASHION CAFE
mark.

24. Plaintiffs have no other adequate remedy at law and
will be irreparably harmed unless this Court grants the relief
prayed for herein.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for judgment and an
adjudication;

A. That Defendant does not have rights in the
trademark "Fashion Cafe" for restaurant services or clothing in
the United States;

B. That Plaintiffs do not infringe trademark rights of
Defendant, if such rights exist, based on its use, advertisement,
promotion, rendering of restaurant services and sale of
merchandise under the name and mark FASHION CAFE:

C. That Plaintiffs do not unfairly compete with
Defendant by use, advertisement, promotion, rendering of
restaurant services and sale of merchandise under the name and
mark FASHION CAFE;

D. That Plaintiffs do not misrepresent the origin of
their FASHION CAFE restaurant services or suggest that these
services originate with or are sponsored by Defendant;

E. That Plaintiffs do not injure the business
reputation of Defendant;

F. That Defendant, its officers, agents, servants,
employees and attorneys and those in active concert or
participation with them, be preliminarily and permanently enjoined
from asserting, contending, claiming, alleging or threatening to
assert that Plaintiffs, their partners, associates, related
companies or potential franchises, have infringed its rights, or
unfairly competed therewith, from bringing suit or threatening to
do so, against Plaintiffs, and from advising the public or press
of any alleged infringement or unfair competition by Plaintiffs;

G. That Defendant, its officers, agents, servants,
employees and attorneys and those in active concert or
participation with them, be preliminarily and permanently enjoined
from publicizing Defendant's claims of infringement and/or unfair
competition against Plaintiffs, and from suing or threatening to
sue Plaintiffs, their partners, associates, related companies or
potential franchisees;

H. Awarding Plaintiffs damages sustained by Plaintiffs
due to the actions of Defendant;

I. Awarding Plaintiffs punitive damages in the amount
of $1,000,000 as a result of Defendant's willful, intentional and
malicious interference with Plaintiffs' business;

J. Awarding Plaintiffs their costs in this action and
their reasonable attorneys' fees; and

K. Such other and further relief as this Court may
deem just and proper.

LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT
OF
DORIS DUKE

I, DORIS DUKE, a resident of and domiciled in the State of New
Jersey, do hereby make, publish and declare this to be my Last
Will and Testament, hereby revoking all wills and codicils at
any time heretofore made by me.

ONE: A. I direct that there be no funeral service or
memorial service of any kind for me and that I be buried at sea.

B. I give my eyes to THE EYE BANK FOR SIGHT RESTORATION INC.,
New York, New York, and I hereby ratify all that anyone
theretofore may have done toward carrying out this gift.

TWO: A. 1. I give, devise and bequeath all of my right,
title and interest in and to a certain portion of my real
property located in Somerville, New Jersey, known as the "parks
area" to my Trustees hereinafter named to be held as a new and
separate wholly charitable trust which shall be created upon my
death and which shall be known as the DORIS DUKE FOUNDATION FOR
THE PRESERVATION OF ENDANGERED WILDLIFE, and such separate
wholly charitable trust shall be administered and distributed
subject to the provisions of Article NINE for the purposes
hereinafter set forth in this Paragraph 1. All references in
this Will to the DORIS DUKE FOUNDATION FOR THE PRESERVATION OF
ENDANGERED WILDLIFE shall refer to such wholly charitable trust.
I direct the DORIS DUKE FOUNDATION FOR THE PRESERVATION OF
ENDANGERED WILDLIFE to use the parks area to provide an
enclosure to protect endangered species of all kinds, both flora
and fauna, from becoming extinct. The funds necessary to operate
the DORIS DUKE FOUNDATION FOR THE PRESERVATION OF ENDANGERED
WILDLIFE shall be provided by the DORIS DUKE CHARITABLE
FOUNDATION as set forth in Article EIGHT hereof.

2. I give, devise and bequeath all of my right, title and
interest in and to a certain portion of my real property located
in Somerville, New Jersey, known as the "farmland and growing
areas" to my Trustees hereinafter named to be held as a new and
separate wholly charitable trust which shall be created upon my
death and which shall be known as the DORIS DUKE FOUNDATION FOR
THE PRESERVATION OF NEW JERSEY FARMLAND AND FARM ANIMALS, and
such separate wholly charitable trust shall be administered and
distributed subject to the provisions of Article NINE for the
purposes hereinafter set forth in this Paragraph 2. All
references in this Will to the DORIS DUKE FOUNDATION FOR THE
PRESERVATION OF NEW JERSEY FARMLAND AND FARM ANIMALS shall refer
to such wholly charitable trust. The DORIS DUKE FOUNDATION FOR
THE PRESERVATION OF NEW JERSEY FARMLAND AND FARM ANIMALS shall
be authorized to lease this property at an annual rental of One
Dollar ($1.00) to a college or university specializing in
farming education. In all events, I direct that this property be
used solely for agricultural and horticultural purposes,
including research (provided that no animals are used to conduct
such research), and that this property be used for the exclusive
purpose of maintaining and protecting the wildlife located on
the property. I direct that the DELAWARE VALLEY COLLEGE OF
SCIENCE AND AGRICULTURE, Doylestown, Pennsylvania, be given the
first right to so lease such property, provided that such
COLLEGE pay all of the expenses of operating such property
during the term of any such lease. The funds necessary for the
DORIS DUKE FOUNDATION FOR THE PRESERVATION OF NEW JERSEY
FARMLAND AND FARM ANIMALS to make required capital improvements
and to purchase farm equipment shall be provided by the DORIS
DUKE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION as set forth in Article EIGHT hereof.

3. I give, devise and bequeath all of my right, title and
interest in and to the balance of my real property, located in
Somerville, New Jersey, and all structures and improvements
located thereon, to my Trustees hereinafter named to be held as
a new and separate wholly charitable trust which shall be
created upon my death and which shall be known as the DORIS DUKE
CHARITABLE FOUNDATION, and such separate wholly charitable trust
shall be administered and distributed subject to the provisions
of Article NINE for the purposes hereinafter set forth in
Subdivisions A through J of Article EIGHT and Subdivision K of
this Article. All references in this Will to the DORIS DUKE
CHARITABLE FOUNDATION shall refer to such wholly charitable
trust. In no event shall the wholly charitable trust which shall
be known as the DORIS DUKE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION be confused
with "The Doris Duke Foundation," which was incorporated in
Delaware in 1934 and which was originally known as "Independent
Aid, Inc." It is my intention that The Doris Duke Foundation
receive no benefit from my estate under this Will or the
exercise of any power of appointment under this Will.

4. I give and bequeath all of my clothing, jewelry and other
personal effects located at my residence in Somerville, New
Jersey at my death to the DORIS DUKE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION.

5. The Thai and Burmese objects of art located at my Somerville,
New Jersey residence and the Thai houses that have been
dismantled and that are presently stored on my Somerville, New
Jersey property are owned by the FOUNDATION FOR SOUTHEAST ASIAN
ART AND CULTURE. It is my hope and expectation that after my
death, such property will either (i) be sold by the FOUNDATION
FOR SOUTHEAST ASIAN ART AND CULTURE, with the proceeds thereof
to be used for the general charitable purposes that I have
supported or (ii) be returned to their respective countries of
origin under appropriate conditions.

6. I give and bequeath all of my furniture, furnishings, books,
linen, silver, china, glassware and other household effects,
automobiles and all other similar tangible personal property of
whatsoever description (hereinafter "Other Tangible Personal
Property") located at my residence in Somerville, New Jersey at
my death to the DORIS DUKE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION, to be used at
its principal headquarters.

B. I give, devise and bequeath my real property located in
Montague City, New Jersey to the Morristown, New Jersey chapter
of the NATURE CONSERVANCY INC., upon the conditions that such
property be kept in its natural state and that such property be
leased for One Dollar ($1.00) per year to the Trail Blazers Camp
so long as such Camp shall be in existence and shall use such
property for its campsite. If the NATURE CONSERVANCY INC. shall
not agree to accept such property on these conditions or if the
Trustees of the DORIS DUKE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION determine in
their absolute discretion that either or both of such conditions
shall have been violated at any time, I direct that such
property shall be distributed to the DORIS DUKE CHARITABLE
FOUNDATION, to be held by it upon the conditions set forth in
the preceding sentence, or if that is not feasible for any
reason, then for the general charitable purposes for which the
DORIS DUKE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION is being administered.

C. I give, devise and bequeath my real property, Known as the
Quarry, in Whitehorse Station, New Jersey (approximately 3.83
acres) to the DORIS DUKE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION.

Rough Point in accordance with the usual standards for
preserving historical properties located in Newport, Rhode
Island. I direct that the first two (2) floors of the residence
(together with the tangible personal property described in
Paragraph 3 of this Subdivision D) be set aside for public
viewing similar to the manner in which the other "summer
cottages" are operated by the Preservation Society and that the
top floor of the residence be used for the NEWPORT RESTORATION
FOUNDATION's offices. (Accordingly, it is my expectation that
the house at Two Marlborough Street owned by the NEWPORT
RESTORATION FOUNDATION be used as a rental property since it
will no longer be used as office space.) Funds to maintain Rough
Point shall be provided by the DORIS DUKE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION
as set forth in Article EIGHT hereof.

personal effects located at my residence known as Rough Point,

E. I give, devise and bequeath such portion of my real property
in Middletown, Rhode Island which is contiguous to the Prescott
Farm Museum (approximately four (4) acres) to the NEWPORT
RESTORATION FOUNDATION, to be used as a part of such Museum. I
direct that the balance of my Middletown, Rhode Island property
be sold and the net sales proceeds thereof be disposed of as a
part of my residuary estate in accordance with the provisions of
Article EIGHT hereof.

F. l. I give, devise and bequeath all of my right, title and
interest in and to my real property, and the structures and

and which shall be known as the DORIS DUKE FOUNDATION FOR
ISLAMIC ART, and such separate wholly charitable trust shall be
held, administered and distributed subject to the provisions of
Article NINE for the purposes hereinafter set forth in this
Paragraph 1. All references in this Will to the DORIS DUKE

trust. The DORIS DUKE FOUNDATION FOR ISLAMIC ART shall promote
the study and understanding of Middle Eastern art and culture. I
direct that the DORIS DUKE FOUNDATION FOR ISLAMIC ART make this
property available to scholars, students and others interested
in the furtherance and preservation of Islamic art and make the
premises open to the public subject to the payment of a
reasonable fee to be fixed by the Trustees of the DORIS DUKE
FOUNDATION FOR ISLAMIC ART. In addition, I direct that the
Honolulu Academy of Arts be permitted to use the premises for
display of its collection of Middle Eastern art without any
charge to the Academy. In the event that the funds derived from
admission fees charged to the public are inadequate to staff and
maintain properly the land, grounds, buildings, furniture,
furnishings and art held by the DORIS DUKE FOUNDATION FOR
ISLAMIC ART, supplemental funds for such purposes shall be
provided by the DORIS DUKE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION as set forth in
Article EIGHT hereof.

personal effects and Other Tangible Personal Property located at

California at my death to the DORIS DUKE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION.

3. If I shall be survived by a dog owned by me and residing at
my death at my residence known as Falcon's Lair, in Beverly
Hills, California, I give such dog to the caretaker of such
property at my death or, if such caretaker is at any time
unwilling or unable to care for such dog, to one of the
foundations created under this Will or of which I was a member,
director, trustee or officer at my death which is caring for
other dogs of mine. If I shall be survived by a dog owned by me
and located at my death at Falcon's Lair, I give and bequeath

of such dog, with the income and principal thereof to be
disposed of as follows:

a. My Trustees, at any time and from time to time, shall apply

3. If NUKU MAKASIALE shall survive me and shall at my death be
in my employ or in the employ of any of the Applicable
Foundations or of any other foundation of which I am a member,
director, trustee or officer at my death, I give and bequeath to
my Trustees a sum which my Executors, in their absolute
discretion, determine shall be necessary, assuming that such sum
will generate interest at a rate of five percent (5%) per annum,
to produce income on an annual basis which shall equal the sum
of (i) the annual salary that NUKU MAKASIALE received from me or
such foundation, as the case may be, for the twelve (12) month
period immediately preceding my death plus (ii) Fifty-Eight
Thousand Dollars ($58,000). Such sum shall be held by my

4. If JINADASA DESILVA shall survive me and shall at my death be

Foundations or of any other foundation of which I am a member,
director, trustee or officer at my death, I give and bequeath to
my Trustees a sum which my Executors, in their absolute
discretion, determine shall be necessary, assuming that such sum
will generate interest at a rate of five percent (5%) per annum,
to produce income on an annual basis which shall equal the sum
of (i) the annual salary that JINADASA DESILVA received from me
or such foundation, as the case may be, for the twelve (12)

5. With respect to each of NILZA MOORE, SHIZUE HAMAMOTO, GEORGE
REED and BENJAMIN REED who shall survive me and shall at my
death be in my employ or in the employ of any of the Applicable
Foundations or of any other foundation of which I am a member,
director, trustee or officer at my death, I give and bequeath to
my Trustees a sum which my Executors, in their absolute
discretion, determine shall be necessary, assuming that such sum
will generate interest at a rate of five percent (5%) per annum,
to produce income on an annual basis which shall equal such
person's annual salary from me or such foundation, as the case
may be, for the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding
my death. With respect to each such person, such sum shall be
held by my Trustees in a separate charitable remainder annuity
trust, with the income and principal of each such trust to be
disposed of in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 6 of
this Subdivision C.

6. Pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Subdivision C,
certain property is to be held by my Trustees in a separate
charitable remainder annuity trust for the benefit of a certain
person. I direct that the income and principal of each such
trust shall be disposed of as follows:

a. Commencing as of the date of my death and continuing during
the lifetime of the person for whose benefit the trust has been
established (the "Beneficiary"), my Trustees shall, in each
taxable year of the trust, pay to the Beneficiary an annuity
amount equal to five percent (5%) of the initial net fair market
value of the property which constitutes the principal of the
trust (the "Annuity Amount"), provided, however, that the payout
percentage (as adjusted to reflect the time and frequency of the
annuity payments) shall not exceed the percentage that would
result in a five percent (5 %) probability that the principal of
the trust shall be exhausted before the death of the
Beneficiary, determined as of the date of my death (or the
alternate valuation date, if applicable).

b. Upon the death of the Beneficiary, the principal and income
of the trust remaining at that time, other than any such
principal and income which may be required to be distributed to
the Beneficiary or the Beneficiary's estate in satisfaction of
the final Annuity Amount payment, shall be distributed outright
to the DORIS DUKE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION. If the DORIS DUKE
CHARITABLE FOUNDATION is not a tax-exempt organization, as
hereinafter defined, at the time when any principal or income of
the trust is to be distributed to it, then my Trustees shall
distribute such principal and income to such one or more tax
-exempt organizations as my Trustees shall determine in their
absolute discretion.

c. The trusts held pursuant to this Paragraph 6 of Subdivision C
shall be administered in accordance with the provisions of
Subdivision D of this Article.

7. I give and bequeath to each other person who shall survive me
and who my Executors shall determine in their absolute
discretion shall be on my payroll or the payroll of any of the
Applicable Foundations or of any other foundation of which I am
a member, director, trustee or officer at my death on a salaried
(but not an hourly) basis, other than a person who is a
beneficiary under another provision of this Will, a sum equal to
one (l) month's salary for each full year of such employment
prior to my death (rounded to the nearest Five Hundred Dollars
($500)), but in no case less than One Thousand Five Hundred
Dollars ($1,500).

8. I give and bequeath to each other person who shall survive me
and who my Executors shall determine in their absolute
discretion shall be on my payroll or the payroll of any of the
Applicable Foundations or of any other foundation of which I am
a member, director, trustee or officer at my death on an hourly
basis, other than a person who is a beneficiary under another
provision of this Will, a sum equal to one (1) month's salary
for each full year of such employment prior to my death (rounded
to the nearest Five Hundred Dollars ($500)), but in no case less
than One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500). For purposes of
this Paragraph 8, one month's salary shall be deemed to equal
one-twelfth (1/12) of the income such person received from me or
such foundation, as the case may be, in the year prior to my
death based on such person's Form W-2 for such year.

9. Notwithstanding anything herein which might suggest a contrary
result, I hereby specifically state that I do not intend by the
provisions of Paragraph 7 or 8 of this Subdivision C to make any
gift or bequest to any person or entity that I, any of the
Applicable Foundations or any other foundation retain as an
independent contractor to perform services, including lawyers,
accountants, physicians, nurses and others who are not my
employees, the employees of an Applicable Foundation or the
employees of any other foundation of which I am a member,
director, trustee or officer at my death.

10. I request that each of NILZA MOORE, GEORGE REED and BENJAMIN
REED who are at my death in the employ of any of the Applicable
Foundations or of any other foundation of which I am a member,
director, trustee or officer at my death have a residence
provided for them by one of such foundations after my death. If
possible, I expect that the DORIS DUKE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION
shall provide such a residence for each of NILZA MOORE and
GEORGE REED and that the NEWPORT RESTORATION FOUNDATION shall
provide such a residence for BENJAMIN REED.

D. Each trust created pursuant to the provisions of Paragraphs
2, 3, 4 and 5 of Subdivision C of this Article and the
provisions of Article SIX of this Will shall be administered as
follows:

1. The obligation to pay the Annuity Amount shall commence on
the date of my death, but payment of the Annuity Amount may be
deferred during a period from the date of my death to the end of
the taxable year of the trust in which occurs the complete
funding of the trust. Within a reasonable time after the end of
the taxable year in which occurs the complete funding of the
trust, my Trustees shall pay to the person for whose benefit the
trust was created (the "Recipient"), in the case of an
underpayment, or shall receive from the Recipient, in the case
of an overpayment, the difference between (a) the total of any
amounts in respect of the Annuity Amount actually paid to the
Recipient, plus interest on such amounts, compounded annually,
computed for any period at the rate of interest that the federal
income tax regulations under Section 664 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended from time to time (the "Code"),
prescribe for the trust for such computation for such period,
and (b) the total of such amounts in respect of the Annuity
Amount that are properly payable, plus interest on such amounts,
compounded annually, computed for any period at the rate of
interest that the federal income tax regulations under Section
664 of the Code prescribe for the trust for such computation for
such period.

2. The Annuity Amount shall be distributed to the Recipient in
equal quarterly installments from income and, to the extent that
income is not sufficient, from principal in accordance with the
following provisions of this Paragraph 2. The Annuity Amount
shall be paid from the ordinary net income (including short-term
capital gain) of the trust other than "unrelated business
income" as defined in Section 681 of the Code. To the extent
that such ordinary net income is insufficient to pay the Annuity
Amount, the Annuity Amount shall be paid from the long-term
capital gain of the trust or, if insufficient, from the
unrelated business income of the trust or, if insufficient, from
income of the trust which is exempt from income taxes or, if
insufficient, from the principal of the trust. As used in this
Paragraph 2, the terms "short-term capital gain" and "long-term
capital gain" are defined as in Section 1222 of the Code.

3. Any income of the trust for a taxable year which shall exceed
the Annuity Amount shall be accumulated and added to principal,
any such capitalized income thereafter to be disposed of as a
part of the principal of the trust.

4. If the first or the last taxable year of the trust or both
such years shall have fewer than 365 days, the Annuity Amount
for such short taxable year or years shall be prorated on a
daily basis, in accordance with Section 1.664-2 of the federal
income tax regulations, or any successor provision thereto. The
taxable year of the trust shall be the calendar year.

5. No additional contributions may be made to the trust. The
initial contribution to the trust shall be deemed to consist of
all property passing to the trust by reason of my death.

6. The computation of the value of the assets transferred to the
trust shall be controlled by the valuations as finally
determined in the federal estate tax proceeding relating to my
estate. If the initial net fair market value of the assets
constituting the trust is determined incorrectly by my Trustees,
then within a reasonable period after the final determination of
the correct value, my Trustees shall pay to the Recipient, in
the case of an undervaluation, or shall receive from the
Recipient, in the case of an overvaluation, an amount equal to
the difference between the total sums in respect of the Annuity
Amount that my Trustees should have paid if the correct value
were used and the total of such sums that my Trustees actually
paid.

7. Notwithstanding any provision of this Will:

a. The income and principal of the trust for each taxable year
shall be distributed at such time and in such manner as not to
subject the trust to any tax under Section 4942 of the Code;

b. Except for the payment of the Annuity Amount to the
Recipient, my Trustees shall not engage in any act of self
dealing, as defined in Section 4941(d) of the Code, and shall
not make any taxable expenditures, as defined in Section 4945(d)
of the Code;

c. My Trustees shall not make any investments that jeopardize
the charitable purpose of the trust, within the meaning of
Section 4944 of the Code and the federal income tax regulations
thereunder, or retain any excess business holdings, within the
meaning of Section 4943(c) of the Code;

d. The Annuity Amount shall not be reduced by any expenses of
the trust including, but not limited to, trustees' commissions;

e. Nothing in this Will shall be construed so as to restrict my
Trustees from investing the assets of the trust in a manner that
could result in the annual realization of a reasonable amount of
income or gain from the sale or disposition of trust assets:

f. It is my intention that the trust shall qualify as a
charitable remainder annuity trust within the meaning of Section
6 of Rev. Proc. 90-32, and any successor revenue procedures
thereto, and Section 664(d)(1) of the Code, and the federal
income tax regulations thereunder, and that the remainder
interest which is to be distributed shall qualify for the estate
tax charitable deduction under the provisions of Section 2055 of
the Code. Accordingly, I hereby direct that (i) no
authorization, direction or other provision contained in this
Will which would prevent the trust and such remainder interest
from so qualifying shall apply, (ii) the trust shall be
interpreted, valued, managed and invested in a manner consistent
with that intent, (iii) no distribution shall be made to the
trust of any property which does not qualify for such charitable
deduction and (iv) it is my further intention that any court
having jurisdiction over this Will shall construe and interpret
and, if necessary, modify and limit the terms and provisions of
this Will so as to permit such remainder interest so to qualify;

g. My Trustees are authorized, acting alone, to amend the trust
in any manner required for the sole purpose of ensuring that the
trust qualifies and continues to qualify as a charitable
remainder annuity trust within the meaning of Section 664(d)(1)
of the Code and the federal income tax regulations thereunder:
and

h. The operation of the trust shall be governed by the laws of
the State of New York. My Trustees, however, are prohibited-from
exercising any power or discretion granted under such laws that
would be inconsistent with the qualification of the trust under
Section 664(d)(1) of the Code and the corresponding regulations.

SIX: If WALKER P. INMAN, JR. shall survive me, I give and
bequeath to my Trustees the sum of Seven Million Dollars
($7,000,000), to be held by my Trustees in a separate charitable
remainder annuity trust for the benefit of WALKER P. INMAN, JR.,
with the income and principal thereof to be disposed of as
follows:

A. Commencing as of the date of my death and continuing during
the lifetime of WALKER P. INMAN, JR., my Trustees shall, in each
taxable year of the trust, pay to WALKER P. INMAN, JR. an
annuity amount equal to five percent (5%) of the initial net
fair market value of the property which constitutes the
principal of the trust (the "Annuity Amount") provided, however,
that the payout percentage (as adjusted to reflect the time and
frequency of the annuity payments) shall not exceed the
percentage that would result in a five percent (5%) probability
that the principal of the trust shall be exhausted before the
death of WALKER P. INMAN, JR., determined as of the date of my
death (or the alternate valuation date, if applicable).

B. Upon the death of WALKER P. INMAN, JR., the principal and
income of the trust remaining at that time, other than any such
principal and income which may be required to be distributed in
satisfaction of the final Annuity Amount payment, shall be
distributed outright to the DORIS DUKE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION. If
the DORIS DUKE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION is not a tax- exempt
organization, as hereinafter defined, at the time when any
principal or income of the trust is to be distributed to it,
then my Trustees shall distribute such principal and income to
such one or more tax-exempt organizations as my Trustees shall
determine in their absolute discretion.

C. The trust created in this Article SIX shall be administered
in accordance with the provisions of Subdivision D of Article
FIVE of this Will.

SEVEN: A. I expressly exercise the general testamentary power of
appointment granted to me by subparagraph (2) of Paragraph C of
the Indenture of Trust, dated May 2, 1917 made by my father,
J.B. Duke, as Grantor and Trustee, with the Farmers' Loan and
Trust Company (now Citibank, N. A., by merger and succession) as
successor Trustee, by directing that the principal, and any
remaining income, of the trust created pursuant to such
Indenture at my death be distributed to the DORIS DUKE
CHARITABLE FOUNDATION which is the wholly charitable trust held
pursuant to the provisions of Article NINE of this Will, to be
administered and distributed as a part thereof.

B. I declare that, despite my 1988 adoption of Chandi Heffner
(who was 35 years old at that time), it is my intention that she
not be deemed to be my child for the purposes of disposing of
the trust property described in Subdivision A of this Article
SEVEN, or for any other purpose of this Will, or otherwise, and
that this Will and all trusts and other entities in which I have
an interest be administered accordingly. I am confident that my
father, who created certain trusts for my lifetime benefit,
would not want Chandi Heffner to have any interest in any such
trust, even if I had wanted her to have such an interest (which
I do not).

EIGHT: I give, devise and bequeath all the rest, residue and
remainder of my estate, real, persona] or mixed, of whatsoever
nature and wheresoever situate, of which I shall die seized or
possessed, or to which I shall be in any way entitled at the
time of my death, including all property over which I shall have
a power of appointment or other power of disposal at the time of
my death, and including any legacies or devises which may lapse
or be invalid or for any reason fail to take effect (herein
referred to as my "residuary estate"), after the payment of all
taxes of whatsoever kind and all debts and expenses properly
chargeable against my residuary estate, to my Trustees, IN
TRUST, NEVERTHELESS, to hold manage, invest and reinvest the
same, to collect the income thereof, and to dispose of the net
income thereof for the educational, charitable, scientific,
literary and artistic purposes for which this wholly charitable
trust is created and which shall be known as the DORIS DUKE
CHARITABLE FOUNDATION, and such trust shall be held,
administered and disposed of subject to the provisions of
Article NINE of this Will and for the purposes described in the
following Subdivisions A through

A. The Trustees shall pay over from time to time to (i) the
DORIS DUKE FOUNDATION FOR THE PRESERVATION OF ENDANGERED
WILDLIFE, (ii) the DORIS DUKE FOUNDATION FOR THE PRESERVATION OF
NEW JERSEY FARMLAND AND FARM ANIMALS, (iii) the NEWPORT
RESTORATION FOUNDATION, (iv) the DORIS DUKE FOUNDATION FOR
ISLAMIC ART, and (v) the NEWPORT GARDENS FOUNDATION, INC. (the
"Charitable Entities") such funds as may be required by the
Charitable Entities to carry out the purposes expressed in the
provisions of this Will with respect to the Charitable Entities.
Such funds shall be disbursed only after the Trustees make
appropriate inquiries into the claimed costs and determine that
the funds paid over shall be utilized solely for the purposes
expressed. Anything to the contrary above notwithstanding, my
Trustees shall distribute such funds to each of the above-named
Charitable Entities pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Subdivision A or pursuant to any other provision of this Will
only if, at the time any funds are to be distributed, the
Charitable Entity qualifies as a tax-exempt organization, as
hereinafter defined.

B. The Trustees may make contributions to tax exempt
organizations that have as their purposes the assistance of
actors, dancers, singers, musicians and other artists of the
entertainment world in fulfilling their ambitions and providing
opportunities for the public presentation of their arts and
talents.

C. I have a special interest in the preservation of wildlife,
both flora and fauna, in the United States and elsewhere, and
also a special interest in the prevention of cruelty to children
or to animals. The Trustees may make contributions to tax-exempt
organizations that they are satisfied are actively and
efficiently promoting these goals.

D. The Trustees may make contributions to tax-exempt
organizations that they are satisfied are actively and
efficiently promoting medical research designed to effectuate
cures of major diseases such as cancer and heart disease, and
other diseases, including sickle cell anemia, provided that no
animals are used to conduct such research.

E. The Trustees may make contributions to tax-exempt
organizations that they are satisfied are actively and
efficiently promoting anti-vivisectionism .

F. The Trustees may make contributions to tax-exempt
organizations that they are satisfied are actively and
efficiently promoting ecological endeavors.

G. If the DORIS DUKE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION has income during any
year that is not disbursed pursuant to the preceding
Subdivisions of this Article EIGHT, the Trustees may make
contributions to various universities and colleges in the United
States that they are satisfied are actively and efficiently
promoting agricultural programs that are for the benefit of the
public or of wildlife or of animals.

H. Whenever the Trustees, in the course of any of the
investigations that I recognize will be required, need expert,
clerical or other types of assistance in conducting such
investigations, they are hereby authorized to retain such
assistance and to pay the reasonable rates required therefor.
These costs shall be charged against income in the year in which
such charges or costs are incurred.

I. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Trustees may give to any tax-exempt charitable organization any
item of tangible personal property they may find impossible or
inappropriate to sell or retain.

J. Unless otherwise provided, in the event that the income
derived by the DORIS DUKE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION is insufficient
in any year to supply the funds that the Trustees deem
appropriate to be disbursed pursuant to the foregoing provisions
of this Article EIGHT, the Trustees are authorized to invade the
principal of the DORIS DUKE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION to supply
those funds.

NINE: Each separate wholly charitable trust created pursuant to
the provisions of this Will shall be held, administered and
distributed by my Trustees for the educational, charitable.
scientific, literary and artistic purposes for which it was
created subject to the following provisions:

A. The Trustees are hereby authorized, in their sole discretion,
at any time and from time to time, to distribute all or any part
of the net income and/or principal of the trust to or for the
use of such one (1) or more entities, including any organization
formed, organized and/or incorporated by the Trustees,
qualifying as exempt from Federal income taxes as an
organization described in and meeting the requirements of
Section 501(c)(3) of the Code, and transfers to which are
deductible for income tax and estate tax purposes under the
provisions of Section 170(c) and Section 2055 of the Code and,
to the extent not inconsistent with the foregoing provisions of
the Code, the income tax and estate tax laws of the state of my
domicile in effect at the time of my death and in effect at the
time of payment or application (herein sometimes referred to as
a "tax-exempt organization" or "tax-exempt organizations") as
the Trustees, in their sole discretion, shall select in such
amounts or proportions, equal or unequal, as the Trustees in
their sole discretion, shall determine.

B. The Trustees are hereby authorized, in their sole discretion,
to terminate the trust at any time, if the Trustees feel that by
so doing the best charitable use will be made of the trust
estate of the trust. Upon termination of the trust, the Trustees
shall transfer, convey and pay over the principal thereof, as it
is then constituted, to such one (I) or more tax-exempt
organizations at the time of such termination as the Trustees
in their sole discretion, shall select, in such amounts or
proportions, equal or unequal, as the Trustees in their sole
discretion, shall determine.

C . The administration and distribution of the trust shall be
subject to the following restrictions: (i) the trust shall be
operated exclusively for purposes allowed for tax-exempt
organizations, (ii) no part of the net earnings of the trust
shall inure to the benefit of any private individual, except
that the Trustees of the trust shall be authorized and empowered
to pay reasonable compensation for services rendered and to make
payments and distributions in furtherance of the trust's general
charitable purposes, (iii) no substantial part of the activities
of the trust shall be carrying on propaganda or otherwise
attempting to influence legislation, (iv) the trust shall not
participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or
distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of
(or in opposition to) any candidate for public office, and (v)
upon the termination of the trust, the assets of the trust shall
be distributed for one or more exempt purposes within the
meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Code or the corresponding
section of any future federal tax code, or shall be distributed
to the federal government, or to a state or local government,
for a public purpose.

D. Notwithstanding the broad nature of the powers and authority
granted to the Trustees by this Article or by any other Article
of this Will, the following provisions shall apply to the trust:

1 The Trustees shall distribute the income of the trust for each
taxable year at such time or times and in such manner as not to
subject the trust to tax under Section 4942 of the Code:

2. The Trustees shall not engage in any act of self-dealing [as
defined in Section 4941(d) of the Code];

3. The Trustees shall not retain any excess business holdings
[as defined in Section 4943(c) of the Code] which would subject
the trust to tax under Section 4943 of the Code;

4. The Trustees shall not make any investments which would
subject the trust to tax under Section 4944 of the Code;

5. The Trustees shall not make any taxable expenditures [as
defined in Section 4945(d) of the Code]; and

6. None of the powers and authorities granted to the Trustees
under any provision of this Will shall be exercised in such a
manner as to disqualify the trust from tax-exempt status under
Section 501(c)(3) or to disqualify the interests in the trust
given to charity from the charitable deduction allowable in
determining the Federal estate tax on my estate.

E. I specifically authorize the Trustees of the trust to form,
organize and/or incorporate any tax-exempt organization as more
completely set forth in Article TEN of this Will. It would not
be inconsistent with my wishes if the Trustees completed the
necessary work to bring such foundations into existence as
tax.exempt organizations. Furthermore, it would not be
inconsistent with my intention if the trust eventually were to
terminate in favor of one or more tax-exempt organizations.
However, I leave the decision as to how these matters are
handled to the sole discretion of my Trustees.

F. It is my intention by this Article to create a trust
conferring a charitable interest which qualifies for a Federal
estate tax charitable deduction and which qualifies as an entity
exempt from Federal income tax. Accordingly, my Executors or the
Trustees are hereby authorized, in their sole discretion, to
apply to qualify the trust for tax-exempt status under Section
501(c)(3). In addition, I hereby direct that the provisions of
my Will applying to this trust shall be construed in a manner
consistent with Sections 2055, 170(c) and 501(c)(3) of the Code
and with the regulations and rulings which from time to time may
be promulgated thereunder, and that my estate and the trust
shall be administered solely in conformity with said sections
and the regulations and rulings thereunder. Notwithstanding any
provision in this Will which might otherwise suggest or direct a
contrary result, should any provision of this Will applying to
the trust be inconsistent or in conflict with said Code
sections, or the regulations or rulings thereunder, then said
Code sections, regulations or rulings shall be deemed to
override and supersede such inconsistent or conflicting
provisions of this Will. If said Code sections, regulations or
rulings at any time require that instruments creating tax-exempt
trusts which are intended to be private charitable foundations
to which the aforesaid Code sections, regulations and rulings
relate contain provisions which are not expressly set forth in
this Will, then such provisions shall be specifically
incorporated herein by this reference, and shall be deemed to be
a pan hereof to the same extent as though they had been
expressly set forth herein. To those ends, the Trustees may
amend the terms of the trust for the sole purpose of complying
with the requirements of said Code sections, regulations and
rulings.

TEN: A. In addition to the powers and authority granted to
my Trustees of each separate wholly charitable trust created
pursuant to the provisions of this Will, I grant the Trustees of
each such trust the power and authority to create under New York
law or the law of any other state a corporation or a trust which
will be operated exclusively for the purposes allowed for tax
-exempt organizations as described in Subdivision A of Article
NINE of this Will, and for the specific charitable purposes for
which such wholly charitable trust was created. Such
corporations or trusts are hereinafter sometimes referred to as
a "foundation" or "foundations".

It is my intention that each of the foundations created
hereunder shall be an organization qualifying under Sections
501(c)(3) and 170(c) of the Code, gifts or bequests to which are
deductible for federal estate and gift tax purposes under the
provisions of Sections 2055(a) and 2522(a), respectively, of the
Code. I direct my Trustees to take or cause to be taken such
action as may be necessary to qualify these corporations or
trusts for exemption from tax under the Code or other applicable
law including. without limitation, establishing procedures for
selecting recipients of the funds of these foundations which
will comply with requirements existing at that time for
obtaining and maintaining their tax-exempt status.

The Certificate of Incorporation, trust agreement or similar
document creating each of these foundations shall include
provisions (among such other provisions as shall be necessary to
create a corporation or trust, gifts and bequests to which are
deductible for federal estate and gift tax purposes under the
provisions of the Code referred to in the preceding paragraph)
providing that (i) these foundations shall be organized and
operated exclusively for purposes allowed for tax-exempt
organizations, (ii) no part of the net earnings of these
foundations shall inure to the benefit of any private
individual, except that these foundations shall be authorized
and empowered to pay reasonable compensation for services
rendered and to make payments and distributions in furtherance
of their general charitable purposes, (iii) no substantial part
of the activities of the foundations shall be carrying on
propaganda or otherwise attempting to influence legislation,
(iv) the foundations shall not participate in, or intervene in
(including the publishing or distributing of statements), any
political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any
candidate for public office, and (v) upon the termination of
each foundation, the assets of the foundation shall be
distributed for one or more exempt purposes within the meaning
of Section 501(c)(3) of the Code or the corresponding section of
any future federal tax code, or shall be distributed to the
federal government, or to a state or local government for a
public purpose.

Those foundations shall not engage in any act of self-dealing,
retain any excess business holdings, make any investment, or
make any taxable expenditures, so as to subject these
foundations to any tax under Sections 4941, 4943, 4944 and 4945,
respectively, of the Code. These foundations shall make
distributions for each taxable year at such time and in such
manner as not to subject these foundations to the tax on
undistributed income imposed by Section 4942 of the Code, and
shall not otherwise engage in any act which would prevent any
transfer under this Will to any of these foundations from
qualifying for a deduction in my estate under the applicable
sections of the Code, or any similar provision of the law of any
state.

B. I direct that the initial directors or trustees of these
foundations shall be BERNARD LAFFERTY, MARIAN OATES CHARLES and
such three (3) additional persons as BERNARD LAFFERTY (or
failing the exercise of such power by Bernard Lafferty, as
MARIAN OATES CHARLES) shall designate in writing, signed and
acknowledged. BERNARD LAFFERTY (or failing the exercise of such
power by Bernard Lafferty, then the initial directors or
trustees) shall select the member(s), if any, of these
foundations and determine the procedures for (i) the selection
and removal of additional and successor members, directors or
trustees, (ii) the selection of officers and (iii) the length of
term of each member, director, trustee or officer.

C. Each of the directors or trustees of each foundation shall
receive reasonable compensation for serving in such capacity as
provided by applicable law; and each director or trustee shall
also be entitled to reimbursement for reasonable expenses
incurred by him or her in the performance of his or her duties
as a director or trustee.

D. No bond or other security shall be required of any director
or trustee. In addition to all powers given the directors or
trustees by law, the certificate of incorporation creating these
corporations or the trust agreements creating these trusts, as
the case may be, shall give the directors or trustees all powers
necessary and appropriate to carrying out my charitable
intentions.

ELEVEN: A. 1. I nominate and appoint BERNARD LAFFERTY as my
individual Executor hereunder, but only if he shall agree to
accept a maximum commission of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000)
for the performance of his duties as Executor.

2. I direct BERNARD LAFFERTY to appoint as a co-Executor such
bank or trust company (the "corporate Executor") as he, in his
absolute discretion, shall select. Such appointment shall be
made by an instrument in writing filed with the clerk of the
appropriate court. BERNARD LAFFERTY shall have the authority to
make such arrangement with a bank or trust company concerning
its compensation for acting as corporate Executor hereunder, and
the acceptance of such fixed compensation shall be a condition
for the appointment of such bank or trust company as co-Executor
hereunder. Any bank or trust company appointed pursuant to this
authority shall have its principal place of business in the
City, County and State of New York and shall be acting as
Trustee of personal trusts having aggregate assets of not less
than Three Billion Five Hundred Million Dollars
($3,500,000,000). However, if BERNARD LAFFERTY shall fail to
effectively appoint a corporate Executor, then I hereby nominate
and appoint UNITED STATES TRUST COMPANY OF NEW YORK, New York,
New York, to serve as the sole Executor hereunder, conditioned
only upon its willingness to accept a maximum commission of
Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000).

3. I authorize, but do not direct, BERNARD LAFFERTY at any time
to appoint such one (1) or more individuals as he, in his
absolute discretion, shall select as additional or successor
individual Executors, provided, however, that BERNARD LAFFERTY
may appoint additional individual Executor(s) only of all
individual Executors shall agree to accept maximum commissions
of Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000) for
the performance of their duties as Executors, such amount to be
divided among them as BERNARD LAFFERTY shall determine, and any
such additional or successor Executor(s) shall serve for such
term and subject to such conditions (including, but not limited
to, the right of BERNARD LAFFERTY or some other person selected
by BERNARD LAFFERTY to remove any person so appointed) as
BERNARD LAFFERTY shall designate in an instrument in writing
filed with the clerk of the appropriate court.

4. I authorize BERNARD LAFFERTY, or if he is not serving as an
Executor of my Will, then any other person who may then be
serving as an Executor [or if there shall be more than one (1)
person serving in such capacity, then all such persons,
jointly], in his [their] absolute discretion to remove the
corporate Executor at any time and, in the event such corporate
Executor is removed, I direct the person(s) with such removal
power to appoint such bank or trust company as he [they], in his
[their] absolute discretion, shall select to act in its place.
Any removal and appointment shall be evidenced by an instrument
in writing delivered to the corporate Executor and to the bank
or trust company being appointed in its place, and shall be
filed with the clerk of the appropriate court. The person(s)
with such removal power shall have the authority to make such
arrangement with such bank or trust company concerning its
compensation for acting as successor corporate Executor
hereunder, and the acceptance of such fixed compensation shall
be a condition for the appointment of such bank or trust company
as co-Executor hereunder. Any bank or trust company appointed
pursuant to this authority shall have its principal place of
business in the City, County and State of New York and shall be
acting as Trustee of personal trusts having aggregate assets of
not less than Three Billion Five Hundred Million Dollars
($3,500,000,000).

B. 1. I nominate and appoint BERNARD LAFFERTY as Trustee of each
trust created hereunder other than any wholly charitable trust
held pursuant to the provisions of Article NINE of this Will.

2. There shall always be at least five (5) Trustees of each
wholly charitable trust held pursuant to the provisions of
Article NINE of this Will. I nominate and appoint BERNARD
LAFFERTY, MARIAN OATES CHARLES and such three (3) additional
persons as BERNARD LAFFERTY shall designate and appoint as the
initial Trustees of each of the wholly charitable trusts created
hereunder and held pursuant to the provisions of Article NINE of
this Will. Each person so appointed by BERNARD LAFFERTY shall
serve for such term and subject to such other conditions
(including, but not limited to, limitations on commissions and
the right of BERNARD LAFFERTY or some other person selected by
BERNARD LAFFERTY to remove any person so appointed) as BERNARD
LAFFERTY in his sole discretion shall designate in an instrument
in writing filed with the clerk of the appropriate court.

3. BERNARD LAFFERTY shall be empowered to establish such
procedures and other terms and conditions as he in his sole
discretion shall deem appropriate for the appointment of co
-Trustees and/or successor Trustees of each separate wholly
charitable trust and each other trust held pursuant to the
provisions of this Will. Such procedures, terms and other
conditions may include, but are not limited to, limitations on
commissions and the right of BERNARD LAFFERTY or some other
person designated by BERNARD LAFFERTY to remove any person so
appointed. If there shall be a vacancy in the trusteeship of any
separate trust [which with respect to any wholly charitable
trust shall mean that there shall be less than five (5) Trustees
serving with respect to such trust], and if BERNARD LAFFERTY
shall not have established a procedure for the appointment of a
successor Trustee to fill such vacancy, then the then acting
Trustee (or all then acting Trustees, jointly) of such trust
shall appoint a successor Trustee to fill such vacancy, and to
the extent necessary to avoid any such further vacancy, shall
establish procedures, terms and conditions for the appointment
of further co-Trustees and successor Trustees; provided,
however, that such procedure may not be inconsistent with or
contravene any procedure, term or condition previously
established by BERNARD LAFFERTY. The establishment of any
procedure for the appointment of co-Trustees and successor
Trustees pursuant to this Paragraph 3, and any appointment of a
co-Trustee or successor Trustee pursuant to this Paragraph 3
shall be made by an instrument in writing filed with the clerk
of the appropriate court.

4. If there shall be a vacancy in the trusteeship of any
separate trust held hereunder which shall not be filed pursuant
to the foregoing provisions of this Subdivision B, then I hereby
nominate and appoint UNITED STATES TRUST COMPANY OF NEW YORK,
New York, New York, to serve as a Trustee of each such trust to
fill such vacancy and to establish procedures for the
appointment of co-Trustees and successor Trustees as
contemplated by Paragraph 3 of this Subdivision B. Any such
appointment shall be made by an instrument in writing filed with
the clerk of the appropriate court.

5. The Trustees of each trust, other than the DORIS DUKE
CHARITABLE FOUNDATION, shall be entitled to receive the annual
commissions provided by law in the State of New York from time
to time for acting as Trustees hereunder, such commissions to be
divided among such Trustees as BERNARD LAFFERTY shall direct
pursuant to the powers vested in him under Paragraphs 2 and 3 of
this Subdivision, or if he shall fail to so direct, then as may
otherwise be provided in any other procedures, terms and
conditions duly established by any other person pursuant to
Paragraph 3 of this Subdivision, or if there shall be no such
direction, then equally among the then acting Trustees. However,
with respect to the DORIS DUKE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION, the
maximum annual commissions to be paid to all Trustees of that
wholly charitable trust shall be one-half (1/2) of the
commissions provided by law in the State of New York from time
to time for serving as Trustees of such trust. The commissions
so payable to the Trustees of the DORIS DUKE CHARITABLE
FOUNDATION shall be divided among such Trustees as BERNARD
LAFFERTY shall direct pursuant to the powers vested in him under
Paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Subdivision, or if he shall fail to
so direct, then as may otherwise be provided in any other
procedures, terms and conditions duly established by any other
person pursuant to Paragraph 3 of this Subdivision, or if there
shall be no such direction, then equally among the then acting
Trustees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if all but not less
than all of the then acting Trustees of the DORIS DUKE
CHARITABLE FOUNDATION shall petition the court having
jurisdiction over such wholly charitable trust for additional
commissions based on extraordinary service or for some other
compelling reason, then such court may set the amount of any
such additional commissions and the allocation thereof among
such Trustees if it finds such petition to be meritorious.

C. I hereby confirm that my Executors' commissions and my
Trustees' commissions are not to be reduced for the other costs
and expenses of administering my estate or of the various trusts
created under this Will, including but not limited to the
compensation of such employees, agents, accountants, custodians,
experts and counsel, legal or investment, as they shall deem
advisable to employ, except that if a bank or a trust company
shall be serving as an Executor or as a Trustee hereunder, no
payment shall be made to such bank or trust company for its
custodian or investment counsel services.

D. I authorize any Executor and Trustee, at any time in office,
to resign by an instrument in writing, signed and acknowledged
in duplicate, one counterpart of which shall be filed in the
court in which this Will shall be admitted to probate, and one
counterpart of which shall be delivered to the remaining or
successor Executors or Trustees or both, as the case may be.

E. Any Executor or Trustee may, at any time and from time to
time, by an instrument in writing, delegate any or all of his or
her rights, powers, duties, authority and privileges, whether or
not discretionary, to any other Executor or Trustee, as the case
may be, for such period or periods of time as may be specified
in such written instrument, provided, however, that any such
instrument shall be revocable at any time and that any Executor
or Trustee who is granted any discretionary power hereunder may
not delegate such discretionary power to any Executor or Trustee
who is not granted such discretionary power.

F. The terms "Executor" and "Executors" wherever used in this
Will shall be taken to mean the executor, executrix, executors
or administrators for the time being in office, and the terms
"Trustee" and "Trustees" wherever used in this Will shall be
taken to mean the trustee or trustees for the time being in
office and each such Executor and Trustee shall have the same
rights, powers, duties, authority and privileges, whether or not
discretionary, as if originally appointed hereunder.

G. I direct that no bond or other security shall be required of
any Executor (including. without limitation, any preliminary
Executor) or Trustee appointed herein or pursuant to the power
granted herein for the faithful performance of his her or its
duties, any law of any state or jurisdiction to the contrary
notwithstanding. To the extent permitted by law, any court of
competent jurisdiction shall grant an order for the advance
payment of commissions without requiring the posting of a bond
by any individual Executor acting hereunder.

H. No beneficiary eligible to receive income or principal from
any trust created hereunder by exercise of my Trustees'
discretionary power to distribute such income or principal, if
such beneficiary shall be acting as a Trustee hereunder, shall
exercise or participate in the exercise of such discretionary
power to distribute the income or principal to himself or
herself.

1. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each
Executor and Trustee hereunder shall be entitled to
reimbursement for reasonable expenses incurred by him, her or it
in connection with the performance of his, her or its duties as
an Executor or Trustee or both hereunder, as the case may be.

J. Ministerial duties of my Executors and my Trustees (such as
opening of safe deposit boxes, signing of checks, execution of
brokerage transactions relating to securities or commodities,
and the like) may be executed by any one Executor or any one
Trustee.

K. Although I am a resident of the State of New Jersey, some of
my assets are located in the State of New York and it is my
desire that my estate shall be administered primarily in the
State of New York and shall, to the extent possible, be governed
by its laws. It is my desire that this Will be admitted to
original probate in the Surrogate's Court in the City, County
and State of New York pursuant to the provisions of Section 1605
of the Surrogate's Court Procedure Act of the State of New York,
as now in effect and as amended from time to time.

L. I hereby elect, pursuant to Section 3-S.1(h) of the Estates,
Powers and Trusts Law of the State of New York, as now in effect
and as amended from time to time, that, as to all of my property
except any real property or tangible personal property located
outside of the State of New York at the time of my death, this
Will and the testamentary dispositions herein contained shall be
construed and regulated in all respects, not only as to
administration but also as to validity and effect, by the laws
of the State of New York, and I direct that my fiduciaries shall
be deemed to possess all discretionary and other powers granted
to them by said laws.

M. Should it be necessary for a representative of my estate to
qualify in any fiduciary capacity, whether as executor,
administrator or otherwise, in any jurisdiction other than New
York or such other state in which the principal administration
of my estate shall be pending, my Executors shall appoint such
persons(s) and/or a bank or trust company to act as such
fiduciary in any such other jurisdiction without giving any
security, and to have thereinafter the rights, powers,
privileges, discretion and duties conferred or imposed upon my
Executors by the provisions of this Will.

N. Any corporation which shall, by merger, consolidation,
purchase or otherwise, succeed to all or substantially all the
personal trust business of any corporation then in office as a
fiduciary hereunder shall, thereupon and without any
appointment, assignment or other action by anyone, succeed to
office hereunder.

TWELVE: Subject to the provisions of Subparagraph f of Paragraph
7 of Subdivision D of Article FIVE hereof, I authorize my
Executors and my Trustees, in their absolute discretion, in any
case in which they are authorized or directed by any provision
of this Will to pay or distribute income or principal to any
beneficiary, to apply the whole or any part of such income, and,
in case such beneficiary shall be incompetent or otherwise under
a legal disability, or by reason of advanced age, illness or
other physical or mental incapacity, incapable of handling and
disposing of his or her property, as determined by my Executors
or my Trustees (other than such beneficiary), as the case may
be, in their absolute discretion, the whole or any part of such
principal, directly to the care, comfort, maintenance, support,
education or use of such beneficiary instead of paying or
distributing the same to such beneficiary, or to pay or
distribute the whole or any part of such income or principal
payable or distributable to any such beneficiary to (i) the
guardian, committee, conservator or other legal representative,
wherever appointed, of such beneficiary, (ii) the person with
whom such beneficiary shall reside, (iii) any other person
having the care and control of such beneficiary, or (iv) such
beneficiary personally, the receipt of the person to whom any
such payment or distribution is so made being a sufficient
discharge therefor even though one of my Executors or one of my
Trustees may be such person.

THIRTEEN: A . Subject to the provisions of Subparagraph f of
Paragraph 7 of Subdivision D of Article FIVE hereof and the
provisions of Subdivision F of Article NINE hereof, I authorize
my Executors and also my Trustees, in their absolute discretion,

any time held or acquired by my Executors or Trustees (including

in addition to all powers granted to my Executors and Trustees

not, and securities, foreign or domestic, or to hold cash
uninvested, as may seem advisable, all without diversification

partnership or joint venture, and in connection therewith to
execute any consents and to take such other action as in their
absolute discretion may seem advisable;

25. To the extent necessary to preserve the value of the
interest of my estate or of any trust in any partnership in
which I shall have been a participant or to maintain my
proportionate interest in any such partnership, to make such
loans to or further investments in any such partnership, upon
such terms as may seem advisable, without liability for any
loss suffered;

26. To pay any and all expenses, costs, fees, taxes, penalties

partly against the principal and partly against the income of
the whole or any part of my estate or of any of the trusts,
parts, funds or shares created by this Will, except as otherwise
expressly provided in Article EIGHTEEN hereof with reference to
estate, transfer, succession or other inheritance taxes; and

27. Generally, to exercise all such rights and powers, and to do
all such acts, and to enter into all such agreements, as persons
owning similar property in their own right might lawfully
exercise. do or enter into.

B. In any case in which my Executors or Trustees are required or
permitted to divide my estate or any part thereof into trusts,
parts, funds or shares, they shall not be required physically to
divide any of the investments or other property held hereunder
but may assign undivided interests therein to the various
trusts, parts, funds or shares.

C. No person dealing with my Executors or Trustees shall be
bound to see to the application or disposition of cash or other
property transferred to my Executors or Trustees, or to inquire
into the authority for or propriety of any action by my
Executors or Trustees.

D. I authorize my Executors, in their absolute discretion, to
allocate any portion of my exemption under Section 2631 (a) of
the Code to any property as to which I am the transferor within
the meaning of Chapter 13 of the Code, including any property
transferred by me during life as to which I did not make an
allocation prior to my death.

E. In connection with valuing my estate for federal estate tax
purposes, I authorize my Executors to value my estate as of the
date of my death or as of such other date as may be permitted
by any alternative method of valuation available under the
provisions of the Code, whichever they reasonably believe, at
the time of filing the federal estate tax return for my estate,
will result in the lowest federal estate tax liability for my
estate. Where deductions can be taken, at the option of my
Executors, either as income tax deductions or as estate tax
deductions, I authorize my Executors to make the election which
they reasonably believe may result in the lowest possible
federal tax liability for my estate on an overall basis.
However, I authorize (but do not direct) my Executors to make an
equitable adjustment between the income and principal accounts
to eliminate any detriment to either account which may be
sustained by reason of their election with respect to any such
deduction.

FOURTEEN: A. Dividends, interest, rents, royalties and other
similar payments, received in cash by my Executors or Trustees,
as the case may be, shall normally be dealt with as income,
whether such payments were ordinary or extraordinary and whether
or not they were in the nature of liquidating payments or
payments on mining stocks or other assets of a wasting nature
(and irrespective of any statement any corporation, other
organization or person declaring or making such payments may
make with reference thereto), and whether or not the investments
to which such payments relate shall have been purchased at a
premium and irrespective of the character of the assets or
accounts out of which they were paid or the time when they
accrued or accumulated or were earned, declared or payable, or
the time for the determination of the persons entitled thereto,
but my Executors or my Trustees, as the case may be, are
authorized, in their absolute discretion, to allocate the whole
or any part of such payments to principal if they shall deem
such action advisable for any reason.

B. Dividends paid in, or distributions of, or rights to
subscribe to (i) securities, whether or not of the same class or
issuer and without regard to the rate or percentage thereof or
the characterization or accounting treatment thereof by the
issuer, or (ii) other property (excluding cash) shall normally
be dealt with as principal, but my Executors or my Trustees, as
the case may be, are authorized, in their absolute discretion,
to allocate to income the whole or any part of any such
dividends, distributions or rights if they shall deem such
action advisable for any reason.

C. The proceeds from the sale, redemption, or other disposition
(whether at a profit or loss) of, and any securities or other
property received (whether in a merger, reorganization,
consolidation or otherwise) in exchange for, any property
constituting principal (including mortgages and real estate
acquired through foreclosure of mortgages or otherwise), shall
normally be dealt with as principal, but my Executors or my
Trustees, as the case may be, are authorized, in their absolute
discretion, to allocate to income a portion of any such
proceeds, securities or other property if the property disposed
of produced no current income or produced current income at a
rate which, in their opinion, was substantially less than an
appropriate rate for trust investments under the circumstances
then prevailing.

D. No part of any income received by my Executors or Trustees,
as the case may be, shall be deemed to be principal by reason of
the fact that such income was earned or accrued or, in the case
of dividends, such dividends were declared prior to the time of
death. All such income shall be held and disposed of in all
respects as though earned and accrued during the period of
administration of my estate.

E. Neither the preceding provisions of this Article nor any
other provision of this Will shall be deemed to authorize any
act by my Executors or Trustees which may be a violation of any
law prohibiting the accumulation of income.

FIFTEEN: A. My Executors may, at any time and from time to time,
render an account of their transactions as Executors with
respect to my estate to the Trustees of the DORIS DUKE
CHARITABLE FOUNDATION.

B. The Trustees of any trust may, at any time and from time to
time, render an account of their transactions as Trustees with
respect to such trust to the Recipient of such trust and to the
DORIS DUKE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION.

C. Such designated person or persons and the DORIS DUKE
CHARITABLE FOUNDATION shall have full power to settle finally
any such account and on the basis of such account to release the
Executors, individually and as Executors, or the Trustees,
individually and as Trustees, as the case may be, from all
liability, responsibility or accountability for their acts or
omissions as Executors or Trustees, as the case may be. In the
event that any one or more of such designated persons shall be
an infant or under other legal disability, then his or her
guardian or committee in any jurisdiction or, in the case of an
infant without a guardian, his or her parents or either of them
shall have full power to act with respect to any such settlement
and release. Any such settlement and release shall be binding
and shall have the force and effect of a final decree, judgment
or order of a court of competent jurisdiction rendered in an
appropriate action or proceeding for the settlement of such an
account in which jurisdiction was obtained of all necessary and
proper parties.

D. The foregoing provisions shall not preclude the Executors and
Trustees from having their accounts judicially settled if they
shall so desire.

SIXTEEN: A. No disposition, charge or encumbrance on the income
or principal of any trust, or any part thereof, by any
beneficiary under this Will by way of anticipation shall be
valid or in any way binding upon my Trustees, and no beneficiary
shall have the right to assign, transfer, encumber or otherwise
dispose of such income or principal, or any part thereof, until
the same shall be paid to such beneficiary by my Trustees, and
no income or principal or any part thereof shall in any way be
liable to any claim of any creditor of any such beneficiary.

B. Unless the context otherwise requires, words in the singular
number include the plural, words in the plural number include
the singular, words of the masculine gender include the feminine
and words of the feminine gender include the masculine.

C. It is my wish that all legacies under this Will shall be
satisfied by my Executors as soon as may be practicable after my
death, but 1 direct that the legacies under Subdivisions A and B
of article FIVE hereof shall bear interest if not paid within
the time specified by law and my Executors shall not be required
to take any discount on account of the early payment of any
legacy.

D. Notwithstanding any provision of this Will to the contrary,
no separate trust, nor any share or portion thereof, shall be
held in trust for longer than, nor shall any estate or trust
created by the exercise of any limited power of appointment
hereunder terminate later than twenty-one (21) years after the
date of death of the last survivor of a group consisting of the
descendants of my grandfather, Washington Duke, who are living
at the date of my death, all natural persons who are mentioned
by name in this Will, and all descendants of all such persons
who are living at the date of my death. If at the expiration of
such period, any separate trust, or any share or portion
thereof, is still held in trust, or any estate has not
terminated, the Trustees shall cease to accumulate the net
income thereof, and such separate trust, or share or portion
thereof, or such estate, shall vest in and immediately be
distributed to the beneficiary of said income, or if there shall
be more than one (l) such beneficiary, then to all such
beneficiaries in equal shares; provided, however, that no trust
or estate shall terminate pursuant to the provisions of this
Subdivision D, if such trust or estate would otherwise be
legally valid without the application of the provisions of this
Subdivision D.

SEVENTEEN: In the event that any beneficiary under this Will and
I or any other person upon whose death such beneficiary shall
become entitled to receive either income or principal hereunder
shall die in a common accident or disaster or under such
circumstances that it is difficult or impracticable to determine
who survived the other, then I direct that for the purposes of
this Will such beneficiary shall be deemed to have predeceased
me or such other person, as the case may be.

EIGHTEEN: A. I direct that all estate, transfer, succession
or other inheritance taxes including the supplemental estate tax
on certain qualified benefits, or any interest or penalty
thereon imposed by the United States or any state thereof or any
foreign country or any subdivision thereof, insofar as such
taxes and interest and penalty are imposed with respect to any
property or interest passing under this Will, shall be paid out
of my entire residuary estate and treated as an expense of
administration. All such taxes, interest or penalty imposed with
respect to any other property shall be apportioned against and
paid out of such property.

B. My Executors may compromise any death taxes, including,
without limitation, any such taxes the assessment, computation
or payment of which may be required by law to be delayed or
postponed, and may pay any such compromised tax at any time
without notice to or the consent of and without liability to any
person who may be or become a beneficiary under this Will,
whether or not any such person shall be a minor or under any
other legal disability or not in being.

NINETEEN: If any legatee, devisee or beneficiary under this
Will shall in any way directly or indirectly contest or object
to the probate of this Will, or dispute any clause or provision
hereof, or exercise or attempt to exercise any right of election
or other right to take any part or share of my estate against
the provisions of this Will, or institute or prosecute, or be in
any way directly or indirectly interested in or instrumental in
the institution or prosecution of, any action, proceeding,
contest or objection, or give any notice for the purpose of
setting aside or invalidating this Will, or any clause or
provision hereof, then and in each such case all provisions for
such legatee, devisee or beneficiary above contained in this
Will or any other benefit to which such legatee, devisee or
beneficiary might become entitled including, without limitation,
any benefit which may pass pursuant to the rules governing
intestate succession, shall be wholly void and ineffectual, and
my estate shall be disposed of in like manner as though such
legatee, devisee or beneficiary, if an individual, had
predeceased me or, if a corporation or other entity, had ceased
to exist prior to my death.

TWENTY: In any judicial proceeding relating to this Will, my
estate or any trust or other fund created hereunder, where a
party to the proceeding has the same interest as a person under
a disability, it shall not be necessary to serve the person
under the disability.

TWENTY-ONE: As indicated in Article SEVEN, it is my intention
that Chandi Heffner not be deemed to be my child for purposes of
disposing of property under this my Will (or any Codicil
thereto). Furthermore, it is not my intention, nor do I believe
that it was ever my father's intention, that Chandi Heffner be
deemed to be a child or lineal descendant of mine for purposes
of disposing of the trust estate of the May 2, 1917 trust which
my father established for my benefit or the Doris Duke Trust,
dated December 11, 1924, which my father established for the
benefit of me, certain other members of the Duke family and
ultimately for charity.

I am extremely troubled by the realization that Chandi Heffner
may use my 1988 adoption of her (when she was 35 years old) to
attempt to benefit financially under the terms of either of the
trusts created by my father. After giving the matter prolonged
and serious consideration, I am convinced that I should not have
adopted Chandi Heffner. I have come to the realization that her
primary motive was financial gain. I firmly believe that, like
me, my father would not have wanted her to have benefited under
the trusts which he created, and similarly, I do not wish her to
benefit from my estate. Accordingly, I specifically authorize
and direct my Executors to steadfastly take any and all actions
and to expend such funds as my Executors in their sole
discretion deem appropriate in order to prove the validity of
this my Will for the purpose of having it admitted to probate. I
also specifically authorize and direct my Executors to
steadfastly take any and all actions and to expend such funds as
my Executors in their sole discretion shall deem advisable in
order to prove the effective exercise of the power of
appointment described in Article SEVEN of this my Will over the
principal and income of.the trust created by my father, J.B.
Duke, as Grantor and Trustee, dated May 2, 1917.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and affix my
seal to this my Last Will and Testament on this 5th day of
April, 1993.

Doris Duke (seal)

<P>Here's the will of David Packard, co-founder of Hewlett-
Packard. Packard left the majority of his holdings, estimated at
$7 billion or more, to the charitable foundation named for him and
his late wife. When the transfer of assets is completed, The David
and Lucille Packard Foundation may be the wealthiest charity in the
world, surpassing the Ford Foundation.</P>

Third:  I nominate as executors ("executor") of this will those of my
children who are competent and willing to act. No bond shall be
required of the executor of this will.

Fourth:  I give to my issue who survive me, by right of
representation, all my jewelry, clothing, household furniture and
furnishings, automobiles and other articles of tangible personal
property not disposed of in any other manner.

Fifth:  I give the residue of my estate to THE DAVID AND LUCILE
PACKARD FOUNDATION; provided, however, if at the time of my
death said foundation is not then in existence or is not then described
in section 2055 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
then I give the residue of my estate instead to such one or more
organizations then described in said sections and in such proportions
as my executor in my executor's absolute and uncontrolled discretion
may select.

Sixth:  A. I authorize (but do not require) my executor:

1. To sell, with or without notice, at either public or private sale, and
to encumber or lease any property belonging to my estate, subject
only to such confirmation of court as may be required by law.

2. To invest and reinvent estate property in such common or
preferred stocks, shares of investment trusts, investment companies,
bonds, debentures, mortgages, deeds of trust, notes, real estate or
other property as to my executor may seem proper, subject only to
such authorization of court as may be required by law.

I subscribe my name to this will this 20th day of August, 1987, at
Los Altos Hills.

LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT  
OF 
JOHN WINSTON ONO LENNON 
 
I, JOHN WINSTON ONO LENNON, a resident of the County 
of New York, State of New York, which I declare to be my 
domicile do hereby make, publish and declare this to be my Last 
Will and Testament, hereby revoking all other Wills, Codicils 
and Testamentary dispositions by me at any time heretofore 
made. 
 
FIRST: The expenses of my funeral and the administration of 
my estate, and all inheritance, estate or succession taxes, 
including interest and penalties, payable by reason of my death 
shall be paid out of and charged generally against the principal 
of my residuary estate without apportionment or proration. My 
Executor shall not seek contribution or reimbursement for any 
such payments. 
 
SECOND: Should my wife survive me, I give, devise and 
bequeath to her absolutely, an amount equal to that portion of 
my residuary estate, the numerator and denominator of which 
shall be determined as follows: 
 
1. The numerator shall be an amount equal to one-half (1/2) of 
my adjusted gross estate less the value of all other property 
included in my gross estate for Federal Estate Tax purposes and 
which pass or shall have passed to my wife either under any 
other provision of this Will or in any manner outside of this Will 
in such manner as to qualify for and be allowed as a marital 
deduction. The words "pass", "have passed", "marital 
deduction"  and adjusted gross estate" shall have the same 
meaning as said words have under those provisions of the 
Untied States Internal Revenue Code applicable to my estate. 
 
2. The denominator shall be an amount representing the value of 
my residuary estate. 
 
THIRD: I give, devise and bequeath all the rest, residue and 
remainder of my estate, wheresoever situate, to the Trustees 
under a Trust Agreement dated November 12, 1979, which I 
signed with my wife YOKO ONO, and ELI GARBER as 
Trustees, to be added to the trust property and held and 
distributed in accordance with the terms of that agreement and 
any amendments made pursuant to its terms before my death. 
 
FOURTH: In the event that my wife and I die under such 
circumstances that there is not sufficient evidence to determine 
which of us has predeceased the other, I hereby declare it to be 
my will that it shall be deemed that I shall have predeceased her 
and that this, my Will, and any and all of its provisions shall be 
construed based upon that assumption. 
 
FIFTH: I hereby nominate, constitute and appoint my beloved 
wife, YOKO ONO, to act as the Executor of this my Last Will 
and Testament. In the event that my beloved wife YOKO ONO 
shall predecease me or chooses not to act for any reason, I 
nominate and appoint ELI GARBER, DAVID WARMFLASH 
and CHARLES PETTIT, in the order named, to act in her place 
and stead. 
 
SIXTH: I nominate, constitute and appoint my wife YOKO 
ONO, as the Gurdian of the person and property of any children 
of the marriage who may survive me. In the event that she 
predeceases me, or for any reason she chooses not to act in that 
capacity, I nominate, constitute and appoint SAM GREEN to 
act in her place and stead. 
 
SEVENTH: No person named herein to serve in any fiduciary 
capacity shall be required to file or post any bond for the faithful 
performance of his or her duties, in that capacity in this or in 
any other jurisdiction, any law to the contrary notwithstanding. 
 
EIGHTH: If any legatee or beneficiary under this will or the 
trust agreement between myself as Grantor and YOKO ONO 
LENNON and ELI GARBER as Trustees, dated November 12, 
1979 shall interpose objections to the probate of this Will, or 
institute or prosecute or be in any way interested or instrumental 
in the institution or prosecution of any action or proceeding for 
the purpose of setting aside or invalidating this Will, then and in 
each such case, I direct that such legatee or beneficiary shall 
receive nothing whatsoever under this Will or the 
aforementioned Trust. 
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have subscribed and sealed and do 
publish and declare these presents as and for my Last Will and 
Testament, this 12th day of November, 1979. 
 
/s/ 
John Winston Ono Lennon

typewritten pages, including this page, was on the 12th day of 
November, 1979, signed, sealed, published and declared by 
JOHN WINSTON ONO LENNON, the Testator therein named,

LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT  
OF  
RICHARD M. NIXON 
 
 I, RICHARD M. NIXON, residing in the Borough of Park 
Ridge, County of Bergen and State of New Jersey, being of 
sound and disposing mind and memory, do hereby make, 
publish and declare this to be my Last Will and Testament, 
revoking all prior Wills and codicils. 
 
      
ARTICLE ONE 
 
 
I give and bequeath to THE RICHARD NIXON LIBRARY 
AND  BIRTHPLACE (hereinafter sometimes referred to as 
the "Library") for its uses, an amount equal to the "adjusted 
proceeds amount" (as hereinafter defined) ; provided, 
however, that if there are any outstanding and unpaid 
amounts on pledges I have made to the Library, including, 
specifically, any amounts unpaid on the One Million Two 
Hundred Thousand Dollar pledge made in 1993, then the 
adjusted proceeds amount under this bequest shall be paid 
first directly to the Library to the extent necessary to satisfy 
such charitable pledge or pledges, and provided further, that 
if at the time of my death or distribution the Library is not 
an organization described in Sections 170(c) and 2055(a) of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 
"Code"), which would entitle the estate to a charitable 
deduction for Federal Estate Tax purposes, I give and 
bequeath such property to THE NIXON BIRTHPLACE 
FOUNDATION, provided further,  if THE NIXON 
BIRTHPLACE FOUNDATION is not then an organization 
described in Sections 170(c) and 2055(a) of the Code, I 
give and bequeath such property to such organization or 
organizations described in said Sections of the Code in such 
shares as my executors shall designate by written and 
acknowledged instrument filed within six months from the 
date of my death with the clerk of the court in which this 
Will shall have been admitted to probate. 
 
In the event such property is distributed to an organization 
other than the RICHARD  NIXON LIBRARY & 
BIRTHPLACE, I request such organization to bear in mind 
my wish that such property ultimately repose in such 
Library, if and when it qualifies as a charitable organization 
under Sections 170(c) and 2055(a) of the Code. 
 
The term "adjusted proceeds amount" shall be defined as 
the excess of  
 
(i)  the amount due or paid to me and/or my estate under the 
judgment entered following the decision of the United 
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit 
in the case of  Richard Nixon v United States of America, 
decided on November 17, 1992, and/or any concurrent or 
subsequent proceedings relating or pertaining thereto, and 
any related or subsequent case, provided that any such 
amounts paid during my life shall only be included as 
adjusted proceeds to the extent such amounts as of the date 
of my death are held or invested in a segregated and 
traceable account or accounts over 
 
(ii) the sum of (a) the amount of all attorneys' fees and 
other costs or expenses, whether previously paid or unpaid, 
associated with or incurred in connection with such 
proceedings or any case similar to or relating thereto and all 
other attorneys' fees from 1974 on, which my estate or I 
have paid or which are outstanding, excluding, however, 
any attorneys' fees paid to the firm of which William E. 
Griffin has been a member, and (b) One Million Four 
Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars, the amount equal to my 
contribution to the Library made in 1992.  The amounts 
under (a) and (b) of this subparagraph (ii) shall be part of 
my              residuary estate. 
 
It is my intention, by this bequest, to make a charitable gift 
of any "windfall" received under the lawsuits referred to 
above, and to first make my family whole by recovering all 
of the legal expenses I have incurred or my estate is to incur 
because of these and other lawsuits. 
 
ARTICLE TWO 
 
A. Subject to the restrictions contained in this paragraph 
and any other restrictions contained in this Will, I give and 
bequeath all items of tangible personal property that I shall 
own at my death which relate to events of my official or 
personal life or the official or personal life of my deceased 
wife, PATRICIA R. NIXON, which have had historical or 
commemorative significance, except for my "personal 
diaries", which are defined and disposed of in Paragraph B 
of this Article, to THE RICHARD NIXON LIBRARY & 
BIRTHPLACE; provided, however, that if at the time of 
my death or distribution such Library is not an organization 
described in Sections 170(c) and 2055(a) of the Code, 
which would entitle the estate to a charitable deduction for 
Federal Estate Tax purposes, I give and bequeath such 
property to THE NIXON BIRTHPLACE FOUNDATION, 
provided further that if THE NIXON BIRTHPLACE 
FOUNDATION is not then an organization described in 
Sections 170(c) and 2055(a) of the Code, I give and 
bequeath such property to such organization or 
organizations described in said Sections of the Code in such 
shares as my executors shall designate by written and 
acknowledged instrument filed within six months from the 
date of my death with the clerk of the court in which this 
Will shall have been admitted to probate. 
 
In the event such property is distributed to an organization 
other than the RICHARD NIXON LIBRARY & 
BIRTHPLACE, I request such organization to bear in mind 
my wish that such property ultimately repose in such 
Library, if and when it qualifies as a charitable organization 
tinder Sections 170(c) and 2055(a) of the Code.  Such 
tangible personal property shall include, without limitation, 
awards, plaques, works of art of all kinds, medals, 
membership or achievement certificates, commemorative 
stamps and coins,          religious items, commemorative 
and personal photographs and all correspondence, 
documents, notes, memoranda, letters and all other writings 
that I own at my death, of whatever kind and nature, 
personal or public, whether inscribed by me or not 
inscribed by me and whether written by me or to me.  I 
direct that the determination as to which items of my 
tangible personal property are included in this bequest, and 
which items are items of tangible personal property 
disposed of under Paragraph C of this Article, shall be 
based          on the decision of my executors; however, it is 
my wish that my executors consult with my surviving 
daughters in making this determination.  The determination 
of my executors shall be conclusive and binding upon all 
parties interested in my estate. 
 
Notwithstanding the above provisions, my daughters, 
PATRICIA NIXON COX and JULIE NIXON 
EISENHOWER, or the survivor, or if neither daughter is 
surviving, my executors, shall have the right, within six 
months of my date of death, to go through all of such 
tangible personal property, to take any such property 
appraised at no value, or any other items of such tangible 
personal property, provided that under no circumstances 
shall the amount of such property taken by my daughters 
exceed in value three (3%) percent of the total value of all 
such property included in this Paragraph A. 
 
B.  I give and bequeath me "personal diaries" (as 
hereinafter defined) in equal shares to my daughters, JULIE 
NIXON EISENHOWER and PATRICIA NIXON COX, or 
all to the survivor. If either or both of my daughters shall, 
disclaim some or all or parts of my "personal diaries", such 
disclaimed items shall be distributed to THE RICHARD 
NIXON LIBRARY AND BIRTHPLACE (the "Library") 
for its uses; provided, however, that if at the time of my 
death or distribution the Library is not an organization 
described in Sections 170(c) and 2055(a) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), which 
would entitle the estate to a charitable deduction for Federal 
Estate Tax purposes, I give and bequeath such property to 
THE NIXON BIRTHPLACE FOUNDATION, provided 
further that if THE NIXON BIRTHPLACE 
FOUNDATION is not then an organization described in 
Sections 170(c) and 2055(a) of the Code, I give and 
bequeath such property to such organization or 
organizations described in said Sections of the Code in such 
shares as my executors shall designate by written and 
acknowledged instrument filed within six months from the 
date of my death with the clerk of the court in which this 
Will shall have been admitted to probate. 
 
In the event such property is distributed to an organization 
other than the RICHARD NIXON LIBRARY & 
BIRTHPLACE, I request such organization to bear in mind 
my wish that such property ultimately repose in such 
Library, if and when it qualifies as a charitable organization 
under Sections 170(c) and 2055(a) of the Code. 
 
If neither of my daughters survives me, I direct my 
executors to collect and destroy my "personal diaries.  
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Will, if 
neither of my daughters survives me, the property 
constituting my "personal diaries" shall be subject to the 
following restrictions: At no time shall my executors be 
allowed to make public, publish, sell, or make available to 
any individual other than my executor (or except as 
required for Federal tax purposes) the contents or any part 
or all of my "personal diaries" and, provided further, that 
my executors shall, within one year from the date of my 
death or, if reasonably necessary, upon the later receipt of a 
closing estate tax letter from the Internal Revenue Service, 
destroy all of my "personal diaries". 
 
My "personal diaries" shall be defined as any notes, tapes, 
transcribed notes, folders, binders, or books that are owned 
by me or to which I may be entitled under a judgment of 
law including, but not limited to, folders, binders, or books 
labeled as Richard Nixon's Diaries, Diary Notes, or labeled 
just by dates, that may contain my daily, weekly or monthly 
activities, thoughts or plans.  The determination of my 
executors as to what property is included in this bequest 
shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties interested 
in my estate; however, it is my wish that my executors 
consult with my surviving daughters and/or my office staff 
in making this determination. 
 
C. If at the time of my death any lawsuit or lawsuits are 
pending regarding the ownership of any of my tangible 
personal property including, but not limited to, all of the 
tangible personal property listed in Paragraph A above, I 
Specifically direct my executors to continue such lawsuits 
for as long as they, in their discretion, deem it appropriate 
to do so, knowing my wishes in this matter. 
 
D. I give and bequeath the balance of the tangible personal 
property I shall own at my death, not otherwise effectively 
disposed of in this Will, to my issue, per stirpes.  If both of 
my daughters, PATRICIA NIXON COX and JULIE 
NIXON EISENHOWER, shall survive me, such tangible 
personal property shall be divided between my daughters in 
such manner as they shall agree, or in the absence of 
agreement, or if any child is a minor, as my executors 
determine, which determination shall be conclusive upon 
all persons interested in my estate. 
 
E. I authorize and empower my executors to pay, and to 
charge as administration expenses of my estate, the 
expenses of storing, packing, insuring and mailing or 
delivering any article of tangible personal property 
hereinabove disposed of. 
 
ARTICLE THREE 
 
A. If my granddaughter, MELANIE EISENHOWER, 
survives me, I give and bequeath to her the sum of Seventy 
Thousand ($70,000.00) Dollars. 
 
B. If my grandson, ALEXANDER  RICHARD 
EISENHOWER, survives me, I give and bequeath to him 
the sum of Thirty Thousand ($30,000.00) Dollars. 
 
C.   If my grandson, CHRISTOPHER COX, survives me, I 
give and bequeath to him the sum of Ten Thousand 
($10,000.00) Dollars. 
 
The specific bequests to my grandchildren named above are 
made to equalize the gifts made to all of my grandchildren 
during my life.  The disparity in amounts, or lack of a 
bequest, is not intended and should not be interpreted as a 
sign of favoritism for one grandchild over another. 
 
ARTICLE FOUR 
 
All of the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real and 
personal, wherever situated, including any lapsed or 
ineffective legacies or devises (but excluding any property 
over which I may have a power of appointment, it being my 
intention not to exercise any such power), herein sometimes 
referred to as my "residuary estate", I dispose of as follows: 
 
A. I give and bequeath the sum of Fifty Thousand 
($50,000.00) Dollars to each grandchild of mine who 
survives me.  
 
B. I give, devise and bequeath the balance of my residuary 
estate to my issue, per stirpes. 
 
C.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this will, if any 
bequest or share of my estate under this Article FOUR 
would be payable to a grandchild of mine for whose benefit 
a separate trust created under the Will of my deceased wife, 
PATRICIA R. NIXON, is then in existence, I direct that 
such bequest or share of my estate shall be distributed to 
the trustee(s) of such trust, to be added to, administered and 
disposed of as part of the principal of such trust in 
accordance with the terms Of such trust; and, provided 
further, that if the addition of any portion or all of this 
residuary bequest or share of my estate to a trust for a 
grandchild under the Will of PATRICIA R. NIXON shall 
cause such trust to have an inclusion ratio greater than zero 
for purposes of the Generation Skipping Transfer Tax 
provisions of Article 13 of the Code (the "GST tax"), then 
any portion, up to the whole, of such bequest or share of 
my estate, that is not exempt from the GST tax shall not be 
added to the trust, but shall be given to such trustee(s) to be 
held in a separate trust under the same terms and 
conditions, my intention being to create two separate trusts, 
one of which has, for GST tax purposes, an inclusion ratio 
of zero, and one of which has an inclusion ratio greater than 
zero. 
 
ARTICLE FIVE 
 
If upon my death no issue of mine shall then be living, I 
give, devise and bequeath my residuary estate, or the then 
remaining principal and, except as hereinabove otherwise 
provided, any undistributed or accrued income of such 
trust, as the case may be, to THE RICHARD NIXON 
LIBRARY & BIRTHPLACE, and if such organization is 
not then in existence, to the persons who would have been 
my heirs under the laws of intestate distribution of New 
Jersey then in effect had I died on the data. of the event 
requiring a distribution. 
 
ARTICLE SIX 
 
I direct that all estate, inheritance and other death taxes 
(including any interest and penalties thereon) imposed by 
any jurisdiction whatsoever by reason of my death upon or 
with respect to any property includable in my estate for the 
purposes of any such taxes, or upon or with respect to any 
person receiving any such property, whether such property 
shall pass under or outside, or shall have passed outside, the 
provisions of this Will, except for additional estate taxes 
imposed by Section 4980(A)(d) of the Code and 
generation-skipping transfer taxes imposed under Section 
13 of the Code ("GST taxes") which may be payable by 
reason of my death, shall be paid, without apportionment, 
from the principal of my residuary estate.  Any GST tax 
payable by reason of my death shall be charged and the 
liability for the payment of such GST taxes shall be 
determined according to the law of the jurisdiction 
imposing such GST tax. 
 
ARTICLE SEVEN 
 
If any beneficiary under this Will and I shall die 
simultaneously or in such circumstances as to render it 
difficult or impossible to determine who predeceased the 
other, it shall conclusively be presumed for the purposes of 
this Will that I survived. 
 
ARTICLE EIGHT 
 
I hereby nominate, constitute and appoint my friends, 
WILLIAM E. GRIFFIN, and JOHN R. TAYLOR, to be the 
co-executors of this Will. 
 
The appointment of my attorney, WILLIAM E. GRIFFIN, 
as a co-executor is made with my knowledge and approval 
of his receipt of commissions as provided by law, and his 
law firms receipt of compensation for legal services 
rendered to my estate. 
 
The individuals named in the foregoing paragraph are 
granted the continuing discretionary power, exercisable 
while in office, and exercisable only unanimously if more 
than one of them is then in office, to designate one or more 
successors or co-fiduciaries or a succession of successors or 
co-fiduciaries in such office to act one at a time or together 
with co-fiduciaries, to fill any vacancy occurring in such 
office after any successor designated herein shall have 
failed to qualify or ceased to act, by written instrument, 
duly acknowledged, and to revoke any such designation 
prior to the happening of the event upon which it is to 
become effective, by a written instrument, duly 
acknowledged, and a new designation may be made as 
above provided.  If there shall be more than one such 
designation of successor fiduciary or co-fiduciary in effect 
and unrevoked, they shall be effective in the reverse of the 
order in which they were made. 
 
Any fiduciary may resign at any time by delivering or 
mailing a notice in writing of such resignation to his or her 
co- fiduciaries, or, if none, to his or her designated 
successor, if such designee has indicated his or her 
willingness to act, and thirty days thereafter such 
resignation shall take effect.  If any fiduciary becomes 
disabled, that determination of disability shall also 
constitute that individual's immediate resignation as a 
fiduciary without any further act.  For the purposes of this 
paragraph, a person shall be considered disabled if either (i) 
a committee, guardian, conservator or similar fiduciary 
shall have been appointed for such person or (ii) a court 
shall have determined, or two physicians shall have 
certified, that the person is incompetent or otherwise unable 
to act prudently and effectively in financial affairs. 
 
Each successor fiduciary and co-fiduciary shall have all 
rights and discretions which are granted to the executors 
named herein, except those which may be specifically 
denied in this will. 
 
At any time that there are two or more fiduciaries then in 
office, all decisions regarding my estate shall be made by 
both or the majority of my fiduciaries in much office.  
However, my fiduciaries may from time to time authorize 
one of their number, or each of them acting singly, to 
execute instruments of any kind on their behalf (including, 
but not by way of limitation, any check, order, demand, 
assignment, transfer, contract, authorization, proxy, 
consent, notice or waiver).  Insofar as third parties dealing 
with my fiduciaries are concerned instruments executed and 
acts performed by one fiduciary pursuant to such 
authorization shall be fully binding as if executed or 
performed by all of them.  An authorization shall be valid 
until those acting in reliance on it receive actual notice of 
its revocation. 
 
No fiduciary shall be required to give any bond or other 
security for the faithful performance of such fiduciary's 
duties in any jurisdiction whatsoever; or if any such bond 
shall be required, no such fiduciary shall be required to 
furnish any surety thereon.   No executor shall be required 
to file a bond to secure the return of any payment or 
payments on account of commissions of such executor. 
 
My individual executors may receive the commissions 
allowable under New Jersey Law from time to time during 
the period of the administration of my estate and any trusts 
hereunder. 
 
Any corporate executor serving hereunder shall receive 
compensation in accordance with its Schedule of Fees in 
effect from time to time during the period over which its 
services are performed. 
 
ARTICLE NINE 
 
I give to my fiduciaries, with respect to any and all 
property, whether real or personal, which I may own at the 
time of my death, or which shall at any time constitute part 
of my estate, including funds held hereunder for persons 
under the age of 21 years, and whether constituting 
principal or income therefrom, in addition to the authority 
and power conferred upon them by law, express authority 
and power to be exercised by them as such fiduciaries, in 
their discretion, for any purpose, without application to, 
authorization from, or confirmation by any court: 
 
a) To retain and to purchase or otherwise acquire stocks, 
whether common or preferred, bonds, obligations, shares or 
interests in investment companies or investment trusts, 
securities issued by or any common trust fund maintained 
by any corporate fiduciary, partnership interests, or any 
other property, real or personal, of whatsoever nature, 
wheresoever situated, without duty to diversify, whether or 
not productive of income and whether or not the same may 
be authorized by law for the investment of estate funds, it 
being my intention to give my fiduciaries the same power 
of investment which I myself possess with respect to my 
own funds. 
 
b) To deposit funds in the savings or commercial 
department of any corporate fiduciary or of any other bank 
without limit as to duration or amount. 
 
c) To sell, without prior authorization or confirmation of 
the court, at public or private sale, exchange, mortgage, 
lease without statutory or other limitation as to duration, 
partition, grant options in excess of six months on, alter, 
improve, demolish buildings, or otherwise deal with any 
property, real or personal, upon any terms and whether for 
cash or upon credit, and to execute and deliver deeds, 
leases, mortgages or other instruments relating hereto. 
 
d) To exercise in person or by proxy all voting, conversion, 
subscription, or other rights incident to the ownership of 
any property, including the right to participate in any 
corporate reorganization, merger or other transaction and to 
retain any property received thereunder and the right to 
delegate discretionary power. 
 
e) To borrow from any person, including any corporate 
fiduciary, -and to lend money to any person, including any 
person beneficially interested hereunder, with or without 
security. 
 
f) To compromise or arbitrate claims, to prepay or accept 
prepayment of any debt, to enforce or abstain from 
enforcing, extend, modify or release any right or claim, or 
to hold any claim after maturity without extension, with or 
without consideration. 
 
g) To hold separate shares or trusts in solido, and to hold 
property in bearer form or in the name of a nominee or 
nominees.

shall discharge the recipient from responsibility for 
property receipted for thereby. 
 
i) To abstain from rendering or filing any inventory or 
periodic account in any court. 
 
j) Without the consent of any beneficiary, to make division 
or distribution in cash or in kind or partly in each.  Any 
such distribution in kind shall be made at the fair market 
value on the date or dates of distribution and may be made 
without regard to the tax basis of such property and without 
any duty to distribute such assets pro rata among 
beneficiaries or to equalize the tax basis recovered by such 
beneficiaries, any provision of this will or rule of law to the 
contrary notwithstanding. 
 
 k) To employ legal and investment counsel, custodians, 
accountants and agents for the transaction of any business 
of my estate or any trust hereunder or for services or 
advice, to pay reasonable compensation therefor out of my 
estate or such trust, as may be applicable, and to rely and 
act or decline to rely or act upon any information or opinion 
furnished by them. 
 
 l) To retain or acquire the stock of any corporation in

tax law; to agree in the apportionment of any joint tax 
liability; to exercise or forbear to exercise any income, gift 
or estate tax options; to determine the allocation of 
exemptions or exercise other elections available to my 
executors for generation-skipping transfer tax purposes; and 
to make or refrain from making adjustments between 
principal and income or between shares of my estate by 
reason of any deduction taken for income tax instead of 
estate tax purposes or any election as to the date of 
valuation of my estate for estate tax purposes, all in such 
manner as my executor may deem advisable, and any such 
determination made by my executor shall be conclusive and 
binding upon all persons affected thereby. 
 
n) To pay out of my general estate in respect of any real or 
tangible personal property situated outside the state of the 
principal administration of my estate at the time of my 
death any administration expense payable under the laws of 
the state or country where such property is situated. 
 
 o) To pay themselves, individually, at such time or times 
and without prior approval of any court or person interested 
in my estate or, any trust hereunder or payment of interest 
or the securing of any bond or rendering of any annual 
statement, account or computation thereof, such sum or 
sums on account of commissions to which they may 
eventually be entitled hereunder as they, in their discretion, 
may determine to be just and reasonable, to charge the 
same wholly against principal or wholly against income, or 
partially against principal and partially against income, as 
they may, in their discretion, determine advisable, and in 
the case of any trustee, to retain commissions which they 
may determine shall be payable out of income from income 
derived from any year preceding or succeeding the year 
with respect to which such commissions shall have been 
earned. 
 
p) Generally, to exercise in good faith and with reasonable 
care all investment and administrative powers and 
discretions of an absolute owner which may lawfully be 
conferred upon a fiduciary. 
 
ARTICLE TEN 
 
A.  Whenever income or Principal is to be distributed or 
applied for  the benefit of a person under the age of 21 
years (referred to as a "minor" in this Article) or a person 
who in the sole judgment of my fiduciaries is incapable of 
managing his or her own affairs, my fiduciaries may make 
payment of such property in any or all of the following 
ways: 
 
1. By paying such property to the parent, guardian or other 
person having the care and control of such minor for such 
minor's benefit or to any authorized person as custodian for 
such minor under any applicable Gifts to Minors Act, with 
authority to authorize any such custodian to hold such 
property until the minor attains the age of 21 years where 
permitted under applicable law. 
 
2. By paying such property to the guardian, committee, 
conservator or other person having the care and control of 
such incapable person. 
 
3. By paying directly to such minor or incapable person 
such sums as my fiduciaries may deem advisable as an 
allowance. 
 
4. By expending such property in such other manner as my 
fiduciaries in their discretion shall determine will benefit 
such minor or incapable person. 
 
B. If principal becomes vested in and payable to a minor, 
my fiduciaries may make payment thereof in any of the 
ways set forth in the preceding paragraph of this Article, or 
may, defer payment of any part or all thereof meanwhile 
paying or applying to or for the use of such minor so much 
or all of such principal and of the income therefrom, as my 
fiduciaries in their discretion may deem advisable.  Any 
income not so expended by my fiduciaries shall be added to 
principal. My fiduciaries shall pay any remaining              
principal to such minor upon such minor's attaining the age 
of 21 years or to such minor's estate upon death prior to 
such payment in full. 
 
C. Any payment or distribution authorized in this Article 
shall be a full discharge to my fiduciaries with respect 
thereto. 
 
ARTICLE ELEVEN 
 
All interests hereunder, whether in principal or income, 
while undistributed and in the possession of my executors, 
and even though vested or distributable, shall not be subject 
to attachment, execution or sequestration for any debt, 
contract, obligation or liability of any beneficiary, and, 
furthermore, shall not be subject to pledge, assignment 
conveyance or anticipation by any beneficiary. 
 
ARTICLE TWELVE 
 
The account (intermediate or final) of any executor may be 
settled by agreement with the adult beneficiaries interested 
in the account and a parent or guardian of those 
beneficiaries who are minors, who shall have the full power 
on the basis of such settlement to release such fiduciary 
from all liability for such fiduciary's acts or omissions as 
executor for the period covered thereby.  Such settlement 
and release shall be binding upon all interested     parties 
hereunder including those who may be under legal 
disability or not yet in being and shall have the force and 
effect of a final decree, judgment or order of a court of 
competent jurisdiction rendered in an action or proceeding 
for an accounting in which jurisdiction was duly obtained 
over all necessary and proper parties.  The foregoing 
provisions, however, shall not preclude any fiduciary from 
having such fiduciary's accounts judicially settled if such 
fiduciary shall so desire.  In any probate, accounting or 
other persons interested in my estate are required by law to 
be served with process, if a party to the proceeding has the 
same interest as or a similar interest to a person under a 
legal disability (including, without limitation, an infant or 
an incompetent) it shall not be necessary to serve process 
upon the person under a disability or otherwise make such 
person a party to the proceeding, it being my intention to 
avoid the appointment of a guardian ad litem wherever 
possible. 
 
ARTICLE THIRTEEN 
 
The validity, construction, effect and administration of the 
testamentary dispositions and the other provisions 
contained in this will shall, in any and all events, be 
administered in accordance with, and construed and 
regulated by, the laws of the State of New Jersey from time 
to time existing. 
 
ARTICLE FOURTEEN 
 
A. Wherever "child", "children" or "issue" appears in this 
Will, it shall be deemed to include only lawful natural issue 
and persons deriving their relationship to or through their 
parent or ancestor by legal adoption prior to such adopted 
person's attainment of the age of 18 years. 
 
B. A disposition in this Will to the descendants of a person 
per stirpes shall be deemed to require a division into a 
sufficient number of equal shares to make one share for 
each child of such person living at the time such disposition 
becomes effective and one share for each then deceased 
child of such person having one or more descendants then 
living, regardless of whether any child of such person is 
then living, with the same principle to be applied in any 
required further division of a share at a more remote 
generation. 
 
ARTICLE FIFTEEN 
 
A. All references herein to this Will shall be construed as 
referring to this Will and any codicil or codicils hereto that 
I may hereafter execute. 
 
B. Wherever necessary or appropriate, the use herein of any 
gender shall be deemed to include the other genders and the 
use herein of either the singular or the plural shall be 
deemed to include the other.  
 
C. Except as otherwise specifically, provided in this will: 
 
1. Each reference to my "fiduciaries" shall be deemed to 
mean and refer to my executor and, where applicable, to a 
custodian hereunder; 
 
2. Each reference to my "executors" shall be deemed to 
mean and refer to the fiduciary or fiduciaries, natural or 
corporate, who shall be acting hereunder in such capacity 
from time to time; and 
 
3. Any and all power, authority and discretion conferred 
upon my executor or my fiduciaries may be exercised by 
the fiduciary or fiduciaries who shall qualify and be acting 
hereunder from time to time in the capacity in which such 
power, authority and discretion are exercised. 
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand 
and seal this (24th) day of February, 1994.

<PRE>
I, JACQUELINE K. ONASSIS, of the City, County and 
State of New York, do make, publish and declare this to be 
my Last Will and Testament, hereby revoking all wills and 
codicils at any time 
heretofore made by me.  
 
FIRST: A. I give and bequeath to my friend RACHEL 
(BUNNY) L. MELLON, if she survives me, in appreciation 
of her designing the Rose Garden in the White House my 
Indian miniature "Lovers 
watching rain clouds," Kangra, about 1780, if owned by me 
at the time of my death, and my large Indian miniature with 
giltwood frame "Gardens of the Palace of the Rajh," a 
panoramic view of a pink walled garden blooming with 
orange flowers, with the Rajh being entertained in a pavilion 
by musicians and dancers, if owned by me at the time of my 
death. 
 
B. I give and bequeath to my friend MAURICE 
TEMPELSMAN, if he survives me, my Greek alabaster 
head of a woman if owned by me at the time of my death. 
 
C. I give and bequeath to my friend ALEXANDER D. 
FORGER, if he survives me, my copy of John F. Kennedy's 
Inaugural Address signed by Robert Frost if owned by me at 
the time of my death. 
 
D. Except as hereinabove otherwise effectively bequeathed, 
I give and bequeath all my tangible personal property, 
including, without limitation, my collection of letters, papers 
and documents, my personal effects, my furniture, 
furnishings, rugs, pictures, books, silver, plate, linen, china, 
glassware, objects 
of art, wearing apparel, jewelry, automobiles and their 
accessories, and all other household goods owned by me at 
the time of my death to my children who survive me, to be 
divided between them by my Executors, in the exercise of 
sole and absolute discretion, in as nearly equal portions as 
may be 
practicable, having due regard for the personal preferences 
of  my children. 
 
I authorize and empower my children, within a period of 
nine (9) months from the date of my death, to renounce and 
disclaim all interest in any part or all of the tangible personal 
property bequeathed to them pursuant to this Paragraph D of 
Article FIRST. Any such disclaimer shall be by instrument 
in writing, 
duly executed and filed in the court in which this Will has 
been admitted to original probate. 
 
E. Any interests in my tangible personal property which are 
disclaimed by my children shall be disposed of as follows: 
 
1. I give and bequeath such items of said tangible personal 
property and interests therein which relate to the life and 
work of my late husband, John F. Kennedy, to JOHN 
FITZGERALD KENNEDY LIBRARY INCORPORATED, 
Boston, Massachusetts, or if said library shall not be a 
qualified charitable beneficiary, as defined in Paragraph A 
of Article SECOND hereof, at the time of my death, to such 
one or more qualified charitable beneficiaries with similar 
purposes as my Executors, in the exercise of sole and 
absolute discretion, shall select. 
 
2. I direct that the balance of said tangible personal property 
shall be sold and the net proceeds of sale shall be added to 
my residuary estate, thereafter to be held, administered and 
disposed of as a part thereof.  
 
F. I give and bequeath all copyright interests owned by me 
at the time of my death in my personal papers, letters or 
other writings by me, including any royalty or other rights 
with respect thereto, to my children who survive me, in 
equal shares. I request, but do not direct, my children to 
respect my wish for 
privacy with respect to such paper, letters and writings and, 
consistent with that wish, to take whatever action is 
warranted to prevent the display, publication or distribution, 
in whole or in part, of these papers, letters and writings. 
 
SECOND: A. I have made no provision in this my Will for 
my sister, Lee B. Radziwill, for whom I have great affection 
because I have already done so during my lifetime. I do 
wish, however, to remember her children and, thus, I direct 
my Executors to set aside the amount of Five Hundred 
Thousand 
Dollars ($500,000) for each child surviving me of my sister, 
Lee B. Radziwill, and I give and bequeath the sum so set 
aside to the Trustees hereinafter named, IN TRUST, 
NEVERTHELESS, to hold 
the same, and to manage, invest and reinvest the same, to 
collect the income thereof and to dispose of the net income 
and principal for the following uses and purposes and 
subject to the following terms and conditions: 
 
1. Payment of Annuity Amount. The Trustees shall hold and 
manage the trust property for a term (the "trust term") which 
shall commence with the date of my death and shall end on 
the tenth (lOth) anniversary thereof. At the end of each 
taxable year of the trust during the trust term (other than any 
short taxable year thereof for which specific provisions are 
hereinafter made), the Trustees shall pay over to such 
organization or organizations, to be selected by the Trustees, 
in the exercise of sole and absolute discretion, and only-to 
such organization or organizations as are described in and 
satisfy the requirements of both of sections 170(c) and 
2055(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended 
(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Code"), at the time 
any such payment or payments to such organization or 
organizations are maybe (such organization or organizations 
shall herein be referred to collectively as the "qualified 
charitable beneficiaries") in such amounts or proportions, 
equal or unequal, as the Trustees,'in the exercise of sole and 
absolute discretion, shall determine, such amount or 
amounts as shall, in the aggregate, equal ten percent (10%) 
of the initial net fair market value of the trust assets as 
finally determined for federal estate tax purposes. Such 
aggregate amount shall hereinafter be referred to as the 
"annuity amount." The annuity amount shall be paid first 
from the ordinary taxable income of the trust (including 
short term capital gains) which is not unrelated business 
income and, to the extent not so satisfied, the annuity 
amount shall be paid from the long term capital gains, the 
unrelated business income, the tax exempt income and 
finally out of the principal of the trust, in that order. In any 
taxable year of the trust in which the net income exceeds the 
annuity amount, the excess, at the end of such taxable year, 
shall be added to trust principal and thereafter shall be held, 
administered and disposed of as a part thereof. Should the 
initial net fair market value of the assets comprising the 
trust, and hence the annuity amount, be incorrectly 
determined, then within a reasonable period after the value 
of such assets is finally determined for federal tax purposes, 
the Trustees shall pay over to the qualified charitable 
beneficiaries, in the case of an undervaluation, or, in the case 
of an overvaluation, shall receive from such beneficiaries to 
which amounts from the trust were paid, in proportion to the 
payments made to each, an aggregate amount equal to the 
difference between the annuity amount properly payable and 
the annuity amount actually paid during such taxable year. 
 
2. Distribution at End of Trust Term. Upon the exploration 
of the trust term, the trust created under this Paragraph A 
shall terminate, and the Trustees shall thereupon transfer, 
convey and pay over the trust assets, as they are then 
constituted (other than any amount due to the qualified 
charitable beneficiaries), 
to the then living descendants of my sister, Lee B. 
Radziwill, per stripes. 
 
3. Proration of Annuity Amount. To determine the proper 
aggregate amount payable from the trust to the qualified 
charitable beneficiaries in any short taxable year of the 
trust's existence, the Trustees shall prorate the annuity 
amount, on a daily basis, in accordance with the applicable 
provisions of Treas. Dept. Reg. Sect. 1.664-2. 
 
4. Deferral Provision. The obligation to pay the annuity 
amount to the qualified charitable beneficiaries shall 
commence with the date of my death, but payment of the 
annuity amount may be deferred from the date of my death 
until the end of the taxable year of the trust in which occurs 
the complete funding of the 
trust. Within a reasonable time after the end of the taxable 
year in which complete funding of the trust occurs, the 
Trustees shall pay to the qualified charitable beneficiaries, in 
the case of an underpayment, or shall receive from the 
qualified charitable beneficiaries, in the case of an 
overpayment, in proportion to the payments made to each, 
the difference between: 
(1) any annuity amounts actually paid, plus interest, 
compounded annually, computed for any period at the rate 
of interest that the Treasury Regulations under section 664 
of the Code prescribe for the trust for such computation for 
such period, and (2) the annuity amounts properly payable, 
plus interest, compounded 
annually, computed for any period at the rate of interest that 
the Treasury Regulations under section 664 of the Code 
prescribe for the trust for such computation for such period. 
 
5. Additional Contributions. No additional contribution shall 
be made to the trust after the initial contribution which shall 
consist of all property passing to the trust by reason of my 
death. 
 
6. Prohibited Transactions. Notwithstanding any other 
provision in this my Will, during the trust term, the Trustees 
are expressly prohibited (a) from engaging in any act of self-
dealing as defined in section 4941(d) of the Code, (b) from 
retaining any business holdings as defined in section 4943(c) 
of the Code which would subject the trust to tax under 
section 4943 of the Code, (c) from making any investments 
which would subject the trust to tax under section 4944 of 
the Code, and (d) from making any taxable expenditures as 
defined in section 4945(d) of the Code. The Trustees shall 
make distributions at such time and in such manner as not to 
subject the trust to tax under section 4942 of said Code. 
 
7. Taxable Year; Code References. As used in this 
Paragraph A, the term "taxable year" of the trust shall mean 
the calendar year and the term "initial net fair market value" 
of the trust assets shall mean the initial net fair market value 
of those assets as the term is used in Section 664(d)(1) of the 
Code. All references to sections of the Code and the 
regulations and rulings issued thereunder in this Paragraph 
A shall be deemed to include future amendments to such 
sections, regulations and rulings as well a6 corresponding 
provisions of future Internal Revenue laws, regulations and 
rulings. 
 
8. Intention. It is my intention to insure that the interest 
committed to the qualified charitable beneficiaries by this 
Paragraph A shall be deductible for income and estate tax 
purposes under the provisions -of the Code. Further, I intend 
that payments of gross income made by the Trustees to 
qualified 
charitable beneflclaries qualify as income tax charitable 
deductions. Accordingly, I direct that all provisions of this 
Paragraph A and this my Will shall be construed to 
effectuate this intention, that all provisions of this Paragraph 
A and this my Will shall be construed, and the trust be 
administered, solely in a manner consistent with sections 
170(c), 642(c), and 2055 of the Code, and with regulations 
and rulings which may be promulgated from time to time 
with respect to trusts creating charitable interests, that none 
of the powers granted to the Trustees by this my Will shall 
be exercised in a manner as to disqualify the trust for such 
deductions and specifically, but without limiting the 
foregoing, that nothing in this my Will shall be construed to 
restrict the Trustees from . investing the trust assets in a 
manner which could result in the annual realization of a 
reasonable amount of income or gain from the 
sale or disposition of trust assets. I hereby grant to my 
Executors and the Trustees all the administrative powers 
necessary to act in compliance with the requirements of the 
Code, as in effect at the time of my death and from time to 
time thereafter, so as to qualify the interest committed to the 
qualified charitable beneficiaries hereunder for the estate 
and income tax charitable deductions. Should any provisions 
of this 
my Will be inconsistent or in conflict with the sections of 
the Code and the regulations and rulings governing 
charitable lead trusts as in effect from time to time, then 
such sections, regulations and rulings shall be deemed to 
override and supersede such inconsistent or conflicting 
provisions. If such 
sections, regulations and rulings at any time require that 
instruments creating charitable lead trusts contain provisions 
which are not expressly set forth in this my Will, then such 
provisions shall be incorporated herein by reference and 
shall be deemed to be part of this my Will to the same extent 
as 
though they had been expressly set forth herein. 
 
9. Trustees' Limited Power of Amendment. The Trustees 
shall have the power, acting alone, to amend the provisions 
governing this trust contained in this my Will in any manner 
required for the sole purpose of ensuring that the trust 
qualifies and continues to qualify as a charitable lead 
annuity trust.

[Handwritten Note: Children Are Takers in Default of 
Exercise; Both Waive] 
 
FOURTH: Under the Will of my late husband, John 
Fitzgerald Kennedy, a marital deduction trust was created 
for my benefit over which I was accorded a general power of 
appointment. I hereby exercise such power of appointment 
and direct that, upon my death, all property subject to such 
power be transferred, 
conveyed and paid over to my descendants who survive me, 
per stripes. 
 
FIFTH: All the rest, residue and remainder of my property 
and estate, both real and personal, of whatsoever kind and 
wheresoever situated, of which I shall die seized or 
possessed or of which I shall be entitled to dispose at the 
time of my death (my "residuary estate"), after the payment 
therefrom of the taxes directed in Article NINTH hereof to 
be paid from my residuary estate (my "net residuary estate"), 
I give, devise and bequeath to the Trustees hereinafter 
named, IN TRUST, NEVERTHELESS, to hold as THE J 
FOUNDATION (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the 
"Foundation") and to manage, invest and 
reinvest the same, to collect the income thereof and to 
dispose of the net income and principal thereof for the 
following uses and purposes subject to the following terms 
and condltlons: 
 
A. 1. Payment of Annuity Amount. The Trustees shall hold 
and manage the Foundation property for a primary term 
which shall commence with the date of my death and shall 
end on the 24th anniversary thereof. In no event, however, 
shall the Foundation's primary term extend beyond a period 
of twenty-one 
(21) years after the death of the last to die of those 
descendants of my former father-in-law Joseph P. Kennedy 
who were in being at the time of my death.] At the end of 
each taxable year of the Foundation during the primary term 
(other than any short taxable year thereof for which specific 
provisions are hereinafter made), the independent Trustees 
(i.e., the Trustees of the Foundation other than any Trustee 
who has disclaimed any property of my Estate which 
becomes a part of the Foundation) shall pay over to such 
organization or organizations, to be selected by the 
independent Trustees, in the exercise of sole and absolute 
discretion, and only to such organization or organizations as 
are described in and satisfy 
the requirements of both of Sections 170(c) and 2055(a) of 
the Code, at the time any such payment or payments to such 
organization or organizations are made (such organization or 
organizations shall herein be referred to collectively as the 
"qualified charitable beneficiaries") in such amounts or 
proportions, equal or unequal, as the independent Trustees, 
in the exercise of sole and absolute discretion, shall 
determine, such amount or amounts as shall, in the 
aggregate, equal eight percent (8%) of the initial net fair 
market value of the assets of the Foundation as finally 
determined for federal estate tax purposes. Such aggregate 
amount shall hereinafter be referred to as the "annuity 
amount." 
 
The annuity amount shall be paid first from the ordinary 
taxable income of the Foundation (including short term 
capital gains) which is not unrelated business income and, to 
the extent not so satisfied, the annuity amount shall be paid 
from the long term capital gains, the unrelated business 
income, the tax exempt income and finally out of the 
principal of the trust, in that order. In any taxable year of the 
Foundation in which the net income exceeds the annuity 
amount, the excess, at the end of such taxable year, shall be 
added to the principal of the Foundation and thereafter shall 
be held, administered and 
disposed of as a part thereof. Should the initial net fair 
market value of the assets comprising the Foundation, and 
hence the annuity amount, be incorrectly determined, then 
within a reasonable period after the value of such assets is 
finally determined for federal tax purposes, the Trustees 
shall pay over 
to the qualified charitable beneflclaries, in the case of an 
undervaluation, or, in the case of an overvaluation, shall 
receive from such beneficiaries to which amounts from the 
Foundation were paid, in proportion to the payments made 
to each, an aggregate amount equal to the difference 
between the 
annuity amount properly payable and the annuity amount 
actually paid during such taxable year. 
 
I have accorded the independent Trustees sole and absolute 
discretion in selecting the qualified charitable beneficiaries 
to receive all or any portion of the annuity amount referred 
to in this Paragraph A of Article FIFTH, stipulating only 
that at the time any payment from the Foundation is made to 
a qualified charitable beneficiary so selected it be an 
organization described in sections 170(c) and 2055(a) of the 
Code. It is my wish, however, that in selecting the particular 
qualified charitable beneficiaries which shall be the 
recipients of benefits from the Foundation the independent 
Trustees give preferential consideration to such eligible 
organization or organizations the purposes and endeavors of 
which the independent Trustees feel are committed to 
making a significant difference in the cultural or social 
betterment of mankind or the relief of human suffering. To 
assist the independent Trustees I authorize, but do not direct, 
that they retain my close friend and confidante Nancy L. 
Tuckerman to assist them in the administration of the 
Foundation. Should the independent Trustees deem it 
advisable to retain Nancy L. Tuckerman, they 
shall pay to her from the assets of the Foundation reasonable 
compensation for the services she shall render. But such 
compensation shall not be charged against the annuity 
amount in any full taxable year of the Foundation nor 
against the appropriate fraction of said amount, determined 
as herein provided, payable to the qualified charitable 
beneficiaries in any short taxable year of the Foundation but 
shall rather be paid from the assets of the Foundation at 
large.2. Proration of the Annuity Amount. To determine the 
proper aggregate amount payable from the Foundation to the 
qualified charitable beneficiaries in any short taxable year of 
the Foundation's existence, the independent Trustees shall 
prorate the annuity amount, on a daily basis, in accordance 
with the applicable provisions of Treas. Dept. Reg. Sect. 
1.664-2. 
 
3. Deferral Provision. The obligation to pay the annuity 
amount to the qualified charitable beneficiaries shall 
commence with the date of my death, but payment of the 
annuity amount may be deferred from the date of my death 
until the end of the taxable year of the Foundation in which 
occurs the complete funding of  the Foundation. Within a 
reasonable time after the end of the taxable year in which 
complete funding of the Foundation occurs, the independent 
Trustees shall pay to the qualified charitable beneficiaries, in 
the case of an underpayment, or shall receive from the 
qualified charitable beneficiaries, in the case of an 
overpayment, in proportion to the payments made to each, 
the difference between (1) any annuity amounts actually 
paid, plus interest, compounded annually, computed for any 
period at the rate of interest that the Treasury Regulations 
under section 664 of the Code prescribe for the Foundation 
for such computation 
during such period, and (2) the annuity amounts properly 
payable, plus interest, compounded annually, computed for 
any period at the rate of interest that the Treasury 
Regulations under section 664 of the Code prescribe for the 
Foundation for such computation during such period. 
 
4. Additional Contributions. No additional contributions 
shall be made to the Foundation after the initial contribution 
which shall consist of all property passing to the Foundation 
by reason of my death. 
 
5. Prohibited Transactions. Notwithstanding any other 
provision in this my Will, during the primary term, the 
Trustees are expressly prohibited (a) from engaging in any 
act of self-dealing as defined in section 4941(d) of the Code, 
(b) from retaining any excess business holdings as defined in 
Section 4943(c) of the Code which would subject the 
Foundation to tax under section 4943 of the Code, (c) from 
making any investments which would subject the 
Foundation to tax under section 4944 of the Code, and (d) 
from making any taxable expenditures as defined in section 
4945(d) of the Code. The Trustees shall make 
distributions at such time and in such manner as not to 
subject the Foundation to tax under section 4942 of the 
Code.  
 
6. Taxable Year: Code References. As used in this 
Paragraph A, the term "taxable year" of the Foundation shall 
mean the calendar year and the term "initial net fair market 
value" of the assets of the Foundation shall mean the initial 
net fair market value of those assets as the term is used in 
section 664(d)(1) of the Code. All references to sections of 
the Code and the regulations and rulings issued thereunder 
in this 
Paragraph A shall be deemed to include future amendments 
to such sections, regulations and rulings as well as 
corresponding provlslons of future Internal Revenue laws, 
regulations and rulings. 
 
7. Intention. It is my intention to insure that the interest 
committed to the qualified charitable beneficiaries by this 
Paragraph A shall be deductible for income and estate tax 
purposes under the provisions of the Code. Further, I intend 
that payments of gross income made by the independent 
Trustees 
to qualified charitable beneficiaries qualify as income tax 
charitable deductions. Accordingly, I direct that all 
provisions of this Paragraph A and this my Will shall be 
construed to effectuate this intention, that all provisions of 
this Paragraph A and this my Will shall be construed, and 
the Foundation be 
administered, solely in a manner consistent with Sections 
170(c), 642(c), and 2055 of the Code, and with regulations 
and rulings which may be promulgated from time to time 
with respect to trusts creating charitable interests, that none 
of the powers granted to the Trustees by this my Will shall 
be exercised in a 
manner as to disqualify the Foundation for such deductions, 
and specifically, but without limiting the foregoing, that 
nothing in this my Will shall be construed to restrict the 
Trustees from investing the assets of the Foundation in a 
manner which could result in the annual realization of a 
reasonable amount of 
income or gain from the sale or disposition of the assets of 
the Foundation. I hereby grant to my Executors and the 
Trustees all the administrative powers necessary to act in 
compliance with the requirements of the Code, as in effect at 
the time of my death and from time to time thereafter, 50 as 
to qualify the 
interest committed to the qualified charitable beneficiaries 
hereunder for the estate and income tax charitable 
deductions. Should any provisions of this my Will be 
inconsistent or in conflict with the sections of the Code and 
the regulations and rulings governing charitable lead trusts 
as in effect from time 
to time, then such sections, regulations and rulings shall be 
deemed to override and supersede such inconsistent or 
conflicting provlslons. If such sections, regulations and 
rulings at any time require that instruments creating 
charitable lead trusts contain provisions which are not 
expressly set forth in this my Will, then such provisions 
shall be incorporated herein by reference and shall be 
deemed to be a 
part of this my Will to the same extent as though they had 
been expressly set forth herein. 
 
8. Trustees' Limited Power of Amendment. The Trustees 
shall have the power, acting alone, to amend the provisions 
governing this Foundation contained in this my Will in any 
manner required for the sole purpose of ensuring that the 
Foundation qualifies and continues to qualify as a charitable 
lead annuity trust.B. Upon the expiration of the Foundation' 
5 primary term the assets of the Foundation (other than any 
amount due to the qualified charitable beneficiaries) shall be 
disposed of in the following manner: 
 
1. If no descendant of any child of mine is then living, the 
assets of the Foundation shall be transferred, conveyed and 
paid over as follows: (a) one-half (1/2) thereof (or the entire 
amount thereof if neither my sister, Lee B. Radziwill, nor 
any descendant of hers is then living) to the then living 
descendants of my cousin Michel Bouvier, per stirpes; and 
(b) the other one-half (1/2) thereof (or the entire amount 
thereof 
if no descendant of my cousin Michel Bouvier is then living) 
to the then living descendants of my sister, Lee B. 
Radziwlll, per stirpes, or, if no such descendant of hers is 
then living, to my said sister, if she shall then be living. 
 
2. If one or more descendants of any child of mine is then 
living but no such descendant was in being at the time of my 
death, the assets of the Foundation shall be transferred, 
conveyed and paid over as follows: (a) one-half (1/2) thereof 
(or the entire amount if no descendant of my son, John F. 
Kennedy, Jr., is then living) to the then living descendants of 
my daughter, Caroline B. Kennedy, Per stirpes; and (b) one-
half 
(1/2) thereof (or the entire amount if no descendant of my 
daughter, Caroline B. Kennedy, is then living) to the then 
living descendants of my son, John F. Kennedy, Jr., per 
stirpes. 
 
3. If any descendant of any child of mine is then living and 
if at least one of those then living descendants was in being 
at the time of my death, the assets of the Foundation shall be 
divided into a sufficient number of equal shares so that there 
shall be set aside one (1) such share for the collective 
descendants who are then living of my daughter, Caroline B. 
Kennedy, if any such descendant is then living, and one (1) 
such 
share for the collective descendants who are then living of 
my son, John F. Kennedy, Jr., if any such descendant is then 
living, such shares to be disposed of as follows: Each such 
share shall be transferred, conveyed and paid over to the 
Trustees hereinafter named to be held in separate trust for a 
secondary trust term for the benefit of the descendants living 
from time to time of the child of mine for whose benefit the 
share has been set aside (such descendants shall hereinafter 
be referred to as the "beneficiaries"). The secondary term for 
any particular trust created hereunder shall terminate upon 
the death of the last to die of the beneficiaries, except that 
the secondary terms of all trusts created pursuant to this 
subparagraph 3 shall in all events terminate simultaneously 
no later than twenty-one (21) years after the death of the last 
to die of the descendants of my former father-in-law Joseph 
P. Kennedy who were in being at the time of my death. The 
Trustees shall manage, invest and reinvest the principal of 
each trust created hereunder, shall collect the income thereof 
and shall pay over or apply the net income, to such extent 
and at such 
time or times as the independent Trustees (i.e., the Trustees 
of each particular trust created hereunder other than any 
Trustee who is also a beneficiary of that trust or of any other 
trust hereunder and other than any Trustee who has 
disclaimed any property of my Estate which becomes a part 
of this trust), in 
the exercise of sole and absolute discretion, deem advisable, 
to or for the use of such one or more of the beneficiaries, as 
the independent Trustees, in the exercise of sole and 
absolute discretion, determine. Any net income not so paid 
over or applied shall be accumulated and added to the 
principal of the trust at least annually and thereafter shall be 
held, administered and disposed of as a part thereof. I 
authorize and 
empower the independent Trustees of each trust created 
hereunder at any time and from time to time to pay over to 
any one or more of the beneficiaries, or to apply for his, her 
or their benefit, out of the principal of such trust, such 
amount or amounts, including the whole thereof, as the 
independent Trustees, in the exercise of sole and absolute 
discretion, deem advisable. Each trust established under this 
subparagraph 3 shall terminate upon the death of the last to 
die of the beneficiaries thereof, and, 
notwithstanding the foregoing, each trust established under 
this subparagraph 3 shall terminate no later than twenty-one 
(21) years after the death of the last to die of the descendants 
of my former father-in-law Joseph P. Kennedy who were in 
being at the time of my death. 
 
The principal of any trust created hereunder which has 
terminated by reason of the death of the last to die of the 
beneficiaries thereof, as such principal is then constituted, 
shall be transferred, conveyed and paid over to the Trustees 
of the other trust or trusts created hereunder, if any such 
trust is still in existence, to be held, administered and 
disposed of as a part thereof. If no other trust created 
hereunder is then 
in existence upon the occurrence of such termination, the 
principal of the last trust created hereunder to terminate, as 
then constituted, shall be transferred, conveyed and paid 
over as follows: 
 
(a) If any descendant of any child of mine is then living, (i) 
one-half (1/2) thereof (or the entire amount if no descendant 
of my son, John F. Kennedy, Jr., is then living) to the then 
living descendants of my daughter, Caroline B. Kennedy, 
per stirpes; and (ii) one-half (1/2) thereof (or the entire 
amount if no 
descendant my daughter, Caroline B. Kennedy, is then 
living) to the then living descendants of my son, John F. 
Kennedy, Jr., per stirpes. 
 
(b) If no descendant of any child of mine is then living (i) 
one-half (1/2) thereof (or the entire amount thereof if neither 
my sister, Lee B. Radziwill, nor any descendant of hers is 
then living) to the then living descendants of my cousin 
Michel Bouvier per stirpes; and (ii) the other one-half (1/2) 
thereof (or the entire amount thereof if no descendant of my 
cousin Michel Bouvier is then living) to the then living 
descendants of my sister, Lee B. Radziwill, per stirpes, or, if 
no such descendant of hers is then living, to my said sister, if 
she shall then be living. 
 
Should any trust created hereunder terminate by reason of 
expiration of a period of twenty-one (21) years after the 
death of the last to die of the descendants of my former 
father-in-law Joseph P. Kennedy in being at the time of my 
death, the principal of each such terminating trust, as then 
constituted, shall be transferred, conveyed and paid over to 
the then living beneficiaries of that trust in equal shares. 
 
SIXTH: A. Unless it shall not be permissible under the 
applicable rules of law to create a trust of the property 
described in this Paragraph A, if any individual under the 
age of twenty-one (21) years becomes entitled to any 
property from my estate upon my death or any property 
from any trust created 
hereunder upon the termination thereof, such property shall 
be held by, and I give, devise and bequeath the same to, the 
Trustees hereinafter named, IN TRUST, NEVERTHELESS, 
for the following uses and purposes: To manage, invest and 
reinvest the same, to collect the income and to apply the net 
income and 
principal to such extent (including the whole thereof) for 
such individual's general use and at such time or times as the 
independent Trustees (i.e., the Trustees of each particular 
trust created hereunder other than any Trustee who is also a 
beneficiary of that trust or of any other trust hereunder and 
other than any Trustee who has disclaimed any property of 
my Estate which becomes a part of this trust), in the exercise 
of sole and absolute discretion, shall determine, until such 
individual reaches the age of twenty-one (21) years, and 
thereupon to transfer, convey and pay over the principal of 
the trust, as it is then constituted, to such individual. Any net 
income not so applied shall be accumulated and added to the 
principal of the trust at least annually and thereafter shall be 
held, administered and disposed of as a part thereof. Upon 
the death of such individual before reaching the age of 
twenty-one (21) years, the Trustees shall transfer, convey 
and pay over the principal of the trust, as it is then 
constituted, to such individual's executors or administrators. 
 
If my Executors or the independent Trustees, as the case 
may be, in the exercise of sole and absolute discretion, 
determine at any time not to transfer in trust or not to 
continue to hold in trust any part or all of such property, as 
the case may be, they shall have full power and authority to 
transfer and pay over 
such property, or any part thereof, without bond, to such 
individual, if an adult under the law of the state of his or her 
domicile at the time of such payment, or to his or her parent, 
the guardian of his or her person or property, or to a 
custodian for such individual under any Uniform Gifts to 
Minors Act pursuant to which a custodian is acting or may 
be appointed. 
 
The receipt of such individual, if an adult, or the parent, the 
guardian or custodian to whom any principal or income is 
transferred and paid over pursuant to any of the above 
provisions shall be a full discharge to my Executors or the 
Trustees, as the case may be, from all liability with respect 
thereto. 
 
B. If it shall not be permissible under the applicable rules of  
law to create a trust of the property hereinabove described in  
Paragraph A, and if such individual is a minor as hereinafter 
defined, in that event such property shall vest absolutely in 
such minor, subject to the following: I hereby authorize and 
empower the Trustees hereinafter named to retain such 
minor's property without bond, as donees of a power in trust 
for the following uses and purposes: To manage, invest and 
reinvest the 
same, to collect the income and to apply the net income and 
principal to such extent (including the whole thereof) for 
such minor's general use and at such time or times as the 
independent Trustees, in the exercise of sole and absolute 
discretion, shall determine, until such minor reaches the age 
of majority, and 
thereupon to transfer, convey and pay over the property, as it 
is then constituted, to such minor. Any net income not so 
applied shall be accumulated and added to principal at least 
annually and thereafter shall be held, administered and 
disposed of as a part thereof. Upon the death of such minor 
before 
reaching his or her majority, the Trustees shall transfer, 
convey and pay over the property, as it is then constituted, to 
such minor's executors or administrators. 
 
If my Executors or the independent Trustees, as the case 
may be, in the exercise of sole and absolute discretion, 
determine at any time not to transfer to the Trustees as such 
donees of a power in trust or not to continue to hold any part 
or all of such property as hereinabove provided, as the case 
may be, they 
shall have full power and authority to transfer and pay over 
such property or any part thereof, without bond, to such 
minor's parent or to the guardian of such minor's person or 
property, or to a custodian for such minor under any 
Uniform Gift to Minors Act pursuant to which a custodian is 
acting or may be appointed. 
 
The receipt of the parent, guardian or custodian to whom 
any property is transferred and paid over pursuant to any of 
the above provisions shall be a full discharge to my 
Executors or the Trustees, as the case may be, from all 
liability with respect thereto. 
 
As compensation for their services under this Paragraph B 
the Trustees shall be entitled to commissions at the rates and 
in the manner allowed to trustees of testamentary trusts 
under the laws of the State of New York in effect from time 
to time. 
 
In administering any property pursuant to this Paragraph B, 
the Trustees shall have all of the powers conferred upon 
them under this Will. 
 
The term "minor" as used in this Paragraph B shall be 
deemed to refer to an individual under the age at which such 
individual may execute a binding contract to dispose of real 
or personal property under the laws of the State of his or her 
domicile. 
 
SEVENTH: Any application of the net income or principal 
of any trust herein created may be by the payment of bills 
rendered for the support, maintenance, education or general 
welfare of the beneficiary for whose use the application is to 
be made or by the payment of net income or principal to 
such person or 
persons, including, in the case of a minor, his or her parent, 
the guardian of his or her person or property or the person 
with whom such minor resides, as the Trustees, in the 
exercise of sole and absolute discretion, deem appropriate. 
Any such payment or application may be made without 
bond, without intervention of any guardian or committee, 
without order of court, without regard to the duty of any 
person to support the beneflclary and without regard to any 
other funds which may be available for the 
purpose. The receipt of the person or persons to whom any 
net income or principal is paid pursuant to this Article shall 
be a full discharge to the Trustees from all liability with 
respect thereto. 
 
EIGHTH: In the event that any beneficiary or beneficiaries 
hereunder upon whose survivorshlp any gift, legacy or 
devise is conditioned and the person or persons, including 
myself, upon whose prior death such gift, legacy or devise 
takes effect shall die simultaneously or under such 
circumstances as to render it 
impossible or difficult to determine who survived the other, 
I hereby declare it to be my will that such beneficiary or 
beneficiaries shall be deemed not to have survived but to 
have predeceased such person or persons, and that this my 
Will and any and all of its provisions shall be construed on 
such 
assumption and basis.  
 
NINTH: A. All estate, inheritance, legacy, succession or 
transfer or other death taxes (including any interest and 
penalties thereon) imposed by any domestic or foreign 
taxing authority with respect to all property owned by me at 
the time of my death and passing under this my Will (other 
than any generation-skipping transfer tax imposed by 
Chapter 13 of the Code, or any successor section or statute 
of like import, and any comparable tax imposed by any other 
taxing authority) shall be paid without apportionment out of 
my residuary estate and without apportionment within my 
residuary estate and with no right of reimbursement from 
any recipient of any such property. By directing payment of 
the aforesaid taxes from my residuary estate only in so far as 
those taxes are generated by property passing under this my 
Will, it is my express intention that the property over which 
I possess a general power of appointment and to which I 
refer in Article FOURTH of this my Will shall bear its own 
share of such taxes. 
 
B. Should my Estate, after payment of all of my debts and 
funeral expenses, the expenses of estate administration and 
the taxes referred to in this Article NINTH, be insufficient to 
satisfy in full all of the preresiduary bequests and devises 
which I make under Articles FIRST through THIRD hereof, 
I direct 
that the bequests and devises in (1) Paragraphs A, B and C 
of Article FIRST, (2) Article SECOND and (3) Paragraph A 
of Article THIRD shall abate last after the abatement of the 
bequests and devises in Paragraphs D and E of Article 
FIRST and Paragraphs B, C and D of Article THIRD. 
 
TENTH: A. My Executors may make such elections under 
the tax laws (including, but without limitation, any election 
under Chapter 13 of the Code) as my Executors, in the 
exercise of sole and absolute discretion, deem advisable, 
regardless of the effect thereof on any of the interests under 
this Will, and I 
direct that there shall be no adjustment of such interests by 
reason of any action taken by my Executors pursuant hereto. 
 
B. My Executors may, in the exercise of sole and absolute 
discretion, disclaim or renounce any interest which I or my 
estate may have under any other will, under any trust 
agreement or otherwise. 
 
C. The determination of my Executors with respect to all 
elections, disclaimers and renunciations referred to in this 
Article shall be final and conclusive upon all persons. 
 
D. I authorize my Executors, in the exercise of sole and 
absolute discretion, to divide (whether before or after any 
trust is funded and whether before or after any allocation of 
GST exemption under section 2631 of the Code is made) 
any trust or any property used or to be used to fund or 
augment any trust created under this Will into two or more 
fractional shares. The shares shall be held and administered 
by the Trustees as separate trusts, but may be managed and 
invested in solido. Some of the purposes for granting this 
authority are to provide an inclusion ratio (within the 
meaning of section 2642(a) of the 
Code) of zero for the separate trust receiving the fractional 
share to which the allocation of GST exemption is made.  
 
Whenever two trusts created under this Will are directed to 
be combined into a single trust (for example, because 
property of one trust is to be added to the other trust), 
whether or not the trusts have different inclusion ratios with 
respect to any common transferor or have different 
transferors for generation 
-skipping transfer tax purposes, the Trustees are authorized, 
in the exercise of sole and absolute discretion, instead of 
combining said trusts, to administer them as two separate 
trusts with identical terms in accordance with the provisions 
that would have governed the combined trusts. However, the 
Trustees 
may manage and invest such separate trusts in solido. 
 
The Trustees are authorized, in the exercise of sole and 
absolute discretion, to combine any one or more trusts with 
identical terms for an identical beneficiary or beneficiaries 
created under this Will as a single trust. The Trustees are 
also authorized, in the exercise of sole and absolute 
discretion, later to divide such trust as provided above in this 
Paragraph. Without in any way limiting the sole and 
absolute discretion of 
the Trustees granted by this Paragraph, I envision that the 
Trustees will not elect to combine two or more trusts with 
different inclusion ratios for generation-skipping transfer tax 
purposes. 
 
ELEVENTH: In addition to, and not by way of limitation of, 
the powers conferred by law upon fiduciaries, subject, 
however, to the directions and prohibitions in Article FIFTH 
hereof, I hereby expressly grant to my Executor~ with 
respect to my estate and the Trustees with respect to each of 
the trust estates herein created, including any accumulated 
income thereof, the powers hereinafter enumerated, all of 
such powers to conferred or granted to be exercised by them 
as they may deem advisable in the exercise of sole and 
absolute discretion: 
 
(1) To purchase or otherwise acquire, and to retain, whether 
originally a part of my estate or subsequently acquired, any 
and all stocks, bonds, notes or other securities, or any variety 
of real or personal property, including securities of any 
corporate fiduciary, or any successor or affiliated 
corporation, interests 
in common trust funds and securities of or other interests in 
investment companies and investment trusts, whether or not 
such investments be of the character permissible for 
investments by fiduciaries; and to make or retain any such 
investment without regard to degree of diversification. 
 
(2) To sell (including to any descendant of mine), lease, 
pledge, mortgage, transfer, exchange, convert or otherwise 
dispose of, or grant options with respect to, any and all 
property at any time forming a part of my estate or any trust 
estate, in any manner, at any time or times, for any purpose, 
for any price and upon any terms, credits and conditions; 
and to enter into leases which extend beyond the period 
fixed by 
statute for leases made by fiduciaries and beyond the 
duration of any trust. 
 
(3) To borrow money from any lender, including any 
corporate fiduciary, for any purpose connected with the 
protection, preservation or improvement of my estate or any 
trust estate, and as security to mortgage or pledge upon any 
terms and conditions any real or personal property of which 
I may die seized or possessed or forming a part of any trust 
estate. 
 
(4) To vote in person or by general or limited proxy with 
respect to any shares of stock or other security; directly or

to make any payments and take any steps proper to obtain 
the 
benefits of any such transaction.  
 
(5) To the extent permitted by law, to register any security in

although I may not be liable thereon; to pay, compromise, 
compound, adjust, submit to arbitration, sell or release any 
claims or demands of my estate or any trust against others or

conditions, including the acceptance of deeds to real 
property in satisfaction of bonds and mortgages; and to 
make any payments 
in connection therewith.  
 
(7) To make distributions in kind (including in satisfaction 
of pecuniary bequests) and to cause any distribution to be 
composed of cash, property or undivided fractional shares in 
property different in kind from any other distribution 
without regard to the income tax basis of the property 
distributed to any 
beneficiary or any trust.  
 
(8) Whenever no corporate fiduciary is acting hereunder, to 
place all or any part of the securities which at any time are 
held by my estate or any trust estate in the care and custody 
of any bank or trust company with no obligation while such 
securities are so deposited to inspect or verify the same and 
with no responsibility for any 1088 or misapplication by the 
bank or trust company; to have all stocks and registered 
securities placed in the name of such bank or trust company 
or in the name of its nominee, to appoint such bank or trust 
company agent and attorney to collect, receive, receipt for 
and disburse any income, and generally to perform the 
duties and services incident to a so-called "custodian" 
account; and to allocate the charges and expenses of such 
bank or trust company to income or to principal or partially 
to income and partially to principal. 
 
(9) To appoint, employ and remove, at any time and from 
time to time, any accountants, attorneys, investment 
counselors, expert advisers, agents, clerks and employees; 
and to fix and pay their compensation from income or 
principal or partially from income and partially from 
principal. Nothing herein contained, however, shall be 
construed to permit any person or entity to receive 
compensation in excess of what is reasonable, as defined for 
purposes of sections 4941(d)(2)(E) and 4945(d)(5) of the 
Code 
and under the laws of the State of New York, if such 
compensation is a charge, directly or indirectly, against any 
charitable lead trust created hereunder. 
 
(10) Whenever permitted by law, to employ a broker-dealer 
as custodian for all or any part of the securities at any time 
held by my estate or any trust estate and to register such 
securities in the name of such broker-dealer.

businesses to remain 90 invested for such time as may 
appear desirable without liability for any such retention of 
any such stock, to advance money to any such corporations 
or businesses in order to aid them in their operations or with 
the view to maintaining or increasing the value of the 
interest therein of my estate or any trust estate; to provide

businesses, either singly or in conjunction with others 
interested therein; to engage and delegate duties and powers 
to any employees, managers or other persons, without 
liability for any delegation except for negligence in

(which compensation shall be in addition to and not in lieu 
of any compensation to which such fiduciary may be entitled 
for acting hereunder); to enter into agreements for voting 
trusts and to deposit securities with the voting trustees, to

sole and absolute discretion, determine and to allocate to 
such divided trust some or all of the assets of the trust estate 
for any reason including, but not limited to, enabling any 
such 
trust or trusts to qualify as an eligible shareholder of a

be, or for any other purpose. 
 
(14) To delegate any duties or powers, discretionary or 
otherwise, to a co-fiduciary for such periods and upon such

instrument acknowledged in such form as would entitle a 
deed of real property to be recorded and delivered to such 
co-fiduciary; and the fiduciary so delegating any duties or 
powers hereunder shall have no further responsibility with 
respect to the 
exercise of such duties or powers so long as such delegation 
shall remain in effect; and any such delegation shall be

(15) To manage any trust created hereunder in solido with

TWELFTH: A. I appoint ALEXANDER D. FORGER and 
MAURICE TEMPELSMAN Executors of this my Last Will 
and Testament. If either of them should fail to qualify or 
cease to act as Executor hereunder, I authorize, but do not 
direct, the other, in the exercise of sole and absolute 
discretion, to appoint as a co-Executor such individual or 
such bank or trust company as he, in the exercise of sole and 
absolute discretion, shall select. Any such appointment shall 
be made by an instrument in writing filed with the clerk of 
the appropriate court. 
 
If at any time and for any reason there is only one Executor 
acting hereunder, I authorize, but do not direct, such 
Executor to appoint such individual or such bank or trust 
company as such Executor, in the exercise of sole and 
absolute discretion, shall select as successor Executor to act 
in his or her place if he or 
she should cease to act. Any such appointment shall be made 
by an instrument in writing filed with the clerk of the 
appropriate court and may be revoked by such Executor 
during his or her lifetime and succeeded by a later 
appointment, the last such appointment to control. 
 
B. Should it be necessary for a representative of my estate to 
qualify in any jurisdiction wherein any Executor named 
herein cannot or may not desire to qualify as such, any other 
Executor acting hereunder shall, without giving any security, 
act as Executor in such jurisdlctlon and shall have therein all 
the 
rights, powers, privileges, discretions and duties conferred 
or imposed upon my Executor by the provisions of this my 
Will, or, if no Executor can or wishes to qualify as Executor 
in such other jurisdiction, or, if at any time and for any 
reason there shall be no Executor in office in such other 
jurisdiction, I appoint as Executor therein such person or 
corporation as may be designated by the Executors acting 
hereunder. Such substituted  Executor shall, without glvlng 
any security, have in such other jurisdiction all the rights, 
powers, privileges, discretions and duties conferred or 
imposed upon my Executors by the provisions  of  this my 
Will. 
 
C. I appoint ALEXANDER and MAURICE 
TEMPELSMAN Trustees of the trust created under 
Paragraph A of Article SECOND of this my Will. If either 
of them should fail to qualify or cease to act 
as a Trustee hereunder, I authorize, but do not direct, the 
other, in the exercise of sole and absolute discretion, to 
appoint as a co-Trustee such individual or such bank or trust 
company as he, in the exercise of sole and absolute 
discretion, shall select. Any such appointment shall be made 
by an instrument in writing filed with the clerk of the 
appropriate court. 
 
If at any time and for any reason there is only one Trustee 
acting for said trust, I authorize, but do not direct, such 
Trustee to appoint such individual or such bank or trust 
company as such Trustee, in the exercise of sole and 
absolute discretion, shall select as successor Trustee to act in 
his or her place if he or she should cease to act. Any such 
appointment shall be made by an instrument in writing filed 
with 
the clerk of the appropriate court and may be revoked by 
such Trustee during his or her lifetime and succeeded by a 
later appointment, the last such appointment to control. 
 
D. I appoint my daughter, CAROLINE B. KENNEDY, my 
son, JOHN F. KENNEDY, JR., ALEXANDER D. 
FORGER and MAURICE TEMPELSMAN Trustees of the 
trust created under Paragraph A of Article FIFTH of this my 
Will and therein designated THE C & J FOUNDATION 
provided, however, that, if my daughter and/or my son 
disclaims any property of my Estate which becomes part of 
the trust created under Paragraph A of Article FIFTH, my 
daughter and/or 
my son who has so disclaimed shall only serve as an 
Administrative Trustee. An Administrative Trustee 19 only 
authorized to take such actions as are necessary to preserve 
and maintain the trust property within the meaning of Treas. 
Reg. S 25.2518-2(d)(2) and, accordingly, is prohibited from 
participating in the exercise, or decision not to exercise, any 
discretion over payments, distributions, applications or 
accumulations of income or principal  by the Trustees, 
including the selection of the charitable beneficiaries of the 
annuity interest. Should any one or more of the Trustees 
herein designated fall to qualify or cease to act as a Trustee 
of said Foundation without having designated his or her 
successor in the manner authorized by Paragraph H of this 
Article, I direct the Trustees or Trustee continuing in office 
to exercise that right so that there shall be a minimum of two 
(2) Trustees in office for the Foundation at all times. 
 
E. I appoint CAROLINE B. KENNEDY and JOHN F. 
KENNEDY, JR. or the survivor of them, Trustees of each 
trust created under subparagraph B(3) of Article FIFTH of 
this my Will provided, however, that, if my daughter and/or 
my son disclaims any property of my Estate which becomes 
part of the trust created 
under Paragraph B(3) of Article FIFTH, my daughter and/or 
my son who has so dlsclalmed shall only serve as an 
Administrative Trustee. An Administrative Trustee is only 
authorized to take such actions as are necessary to preserve 
and maintain the trust property within the meaning of Treas. 
Reg. Sect. 25.2518-2(d)(2) and, accordingly, is prohibited 
from participating in the exercise, or decision not to 
exercise, any discretion over payments, distributions, 
applications or accumulations of income or principal by the 
Trustees. In addition, appoint as co-Trustee or co-Trustees 
of each such trust such person or persons and/or bank or 
trust company as my son and daughter, or the survivor of 
them, shall agree upon and designate as co-Trustee or co-
Trustees by an instrument in writing to be filed with the 
clerk 
of the appropriate court. It shall not be necessary to appoint 
successors to any individual acting as a Trustee of any trust 
created under subparagraph B(3) of Article FIFTH hereof if 
and during such time as a bank or trust company shall be 
acting hereunder. 
 
F. I appoint my daughter, CAROLINE B. KENNEDY, and 
my son, JOHN F. KENNEDY, JR., Trustees of any trust 
created under Article SIXTH of this my Will, and I 
authorize any one parent of any individual for whom any 
such trust is created to qualify as a co- Trustee of such trust 
if he or she cares to do so provided, however, that, if my 
daughter and/or my son disclaims any property of my Estate 
which becomes part of the trust created under Article 
SIXTH, my daughter and/or my son who has so disclaimed 
shall only serve as an Administrative Trustee. An 
Administrative Trustee is only authorized to take such 
actions as are necessary to preserve and maintain the trust 
property within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Sect. 25.2518-
2(d)(2) and, accordingly, is prohibited from participating in 
the exercise, or decision not to exercise, any discretion over 
payments, distributions, applications or accumulations of 
income or 
principal by the Trustees. 
 
G. Any Executor or Trustee may resign from office without 
leave of court at any time and for any reason by filing a 
written instrument of resignation with the clerk of the 
appropriate court. 
 
H. I authorize and empower any individual acting as a 
Trustee of any one or more of the trusts created hereunder to 
appoint at any time and from time to time any individual or

Trustee of any one or 
more of such trusts in the event that the person so making 
the appointment shall cease to act as a Trustee of such trust 
or trusts due to his or her death or resignation. If more than

Trustee of any one or more of the trusts created hereunder

actions which are necessary or appropriate, I appoint as co-

the then acting Trustee or Trustees. Any such appointment 
shall be made by an instrument in writing filed with the

Last Will And Testament Of Elvis A. Presley, Deceased
Filed August 22, 1977

         Last Will And Testament of Elvis Presley

 I, Elvis A. Presley, a resident and citizen of Shelby County,
Tennessee, being of sound mind and disposing memory, do hereby
make, publish and declare this instrument to be my last will and
testament, hereby revoking any and all wills and codicils by me
at any time heretofore made.

                          Item I
                Debts, Expenses and Taxes

 I direct my Executor, hereinafter named, to pay all of my
matured debts and my funeral expenses, as well as the costs and
expenses of the administration of my estate, as soon after my
death as practicable. I further direct that all estate,
inheritance, transfer and succession taxes which are payable by
reason under this will, be paid out of my residuary estate; and
I hereby waive on behalf of my estate any right to recover from
any person any part of such taxes so paid. My Executor, in his
sole discretion, may pay from my domiciliary estate all or any
portion of the costs of ancillary administration and similar
proceedings in other jurisdictions.

                          Item II

 Instruction Concerning Personal Property: Enjoyment in Specie

 I anticipate that included as a part of my property and estate
at the time of my death will be tangible personal property of
various kinds, characters and values, including trophies and
other items accumulated by me during my professional career. I
hereby specifically instruct all concerned that my Executor,
herein appointed, shall have complete freedom and discretion as
to disposal of any and all such property so long as he shall act
in good faith and in the best interest of my estate and my
beneficiaries, and his discretion so exercised shall not be
subject to question by anyone whomsoever.

 I hereby expressly authorize my Executor and my Trustee,
respectively and successively, to permit any beneficiary of any
and all trusts created hereunder to enjoy in specie the use or
benefit of any household goods, chattels, or other tangible
personal property (exclusive of choses in action, cash,
stocks, bonds or other securities) which either my Executor or my
Trustees may receive in kind, and my Executor and my Trustees
shall not be liable for any consumption, damage, injury to or
loss of any tangible property so used, nor shall the
beneficiaries of any trusts hereunder or their executors of
administrators be liable for any consumption, damage, injury to
or loss of any tangible personal property so used.

                       Item III

                     Real Estate

 If I am the owner of any real estate at the time of my death, I
instruct and empower my Executor and my Trustee (as the case may
be) to hold such real estate for investment, or to sell same, or
any portion therof, as my Executor or my Trustee (as the case
may be) shall in his sole judgment determine to be for the best
interest of my estate and the beneficiaries thereof.

                        Item IV

                     Residuary Trust

 After payment of all debts, expenses and taxes as directed under
Item I hereof, I give, devise, and bequeath all the rest,
residue, and remainder of my estate, including all lapsed
legacies and devices, and any property over which I have a power
of appointment, to my Trustee, hereinafter named, in trust for
the following purposes:

 (a) The Trustees is directed to take, hold, manage, invest and
reinvent the corpus of the trust and to collect the income
therefrom in accordance with the rights, powers, duties,
authority and discretion hereinafter set forth. The Trustee is
directed to pay all the expenses, taxes and costs incurred in
the management of the trust estate out of the income thereof.

 (b) After payment of all expenses, taxes and costs incurred in
the management of the expenses, taxes and costs incurred in the
management of the trust estate, the Trustee is authorizes to
accumulate the net income or to pay or apply so much of the net
income and such portion of the principal at any time and from
time to time to time for health, education, support, comfortable
maintenance and welfare of: (1) My daughter, Lisa
Marie Presley, and any other lawful issue I might have, (2) my
grandmother, Minnie Mae Presley, (3) my father, Vernon E.
Presley, and (4) such other relatives of mine living at the time
of my death who in the absolute discretion of my Trustees are in
need of emergency assistance for any of the above mentioned
purposes and the Trustee is able to make such distribution
without affecting the ability of the trust to meet the present
needs of the first three numbered categories of beneficiaries
herein mentioned or to meet the reasonably expected future needs
of the first three classes of beneficiaries herein mentioned.
Any decision of the Trustee as to whether or not distribution,
to any of the persons described hereunder shall be final and
conclusive and not subject to question by any legatee or
beneficiary hereunder.

 (c) Upon the death of my Father, Vernon E. Presley, the Trustee
is instructed to make no further distributions to the fourth
category of beneficiaries and such beneficiaries shall cease to
have any interest whatsoever in this trust.

 (d) Upon the death of both my said father and my said
grandmother, the Trustee is directed to divide the Residuary
Trust into separate and equal trusts, creating one such equal
trust for each of my lawful children then surviving and one such
equal trust for the living issue collectively, if any, of any
deceased child of mine. The share, if any, for the issue of any
such deceased child, shall immediately vest in such issue in
equal shares but shall be subject to the provisions of Item V
herein. Separate books and records shall be kept for each
trust, but it shall not be necessary that a physical division of
the assets be made as to each trust.

 The Trustee may from time to time distribute the whole or any
part of the net income or principal from each of the aforesaid
trusts as the Trustee, in its uncontrolled discretion, considers
necessary or desirable to provide for the comfortable support,
education, maintenance, benefit and general welfare of each of
my children. Such distributions may be made directly to such
beneficiary or to the guardian of the person of such beneficiary
and without repsonsibilty on my Trustee to see to the
application of nay such distributions and in making such
distributions, the Trustee shall take into account all other
sources of funds known by the Trustee to be available for each
respective beneficiary for such purpose.

 (e) As each of my respective children attains the age of
twenty-five (25) years and provided that both my father and my
grandmother are deceased, the trust created hereunder for such
child care terminate, and all the remainder of the assets then
contained in said trust shall be distributed to such child so
attaining the age of twenty-five (25) years outright and free of
further trust.

 (f) If any of my children for whose benefit a trust has been
created hereunder should die before attaining the age of twenty-
five (25) years, then the trust created for such a child shall
terminate on his death, and all remaining assets then contained
in said trust shall be distributed outright and free of further
trust and in equal shares to the surviving issue of such
deceased child but subject to the provisions of Item V herein;
but if there be no such surviving issue , then to the brothers
and sisters of such deceased child in equal shares, the issue of
any other deceased child being entitled collectively to their
deceased parent's share. Nevertheless, if any distribution
otherwise becomes payable outright and free of trust under the
provisions of this paragraph (f) of the Item IV of my will to a
beneficiary for whom the Trustee is then administering a trust
for the benefit of such beneficiary under provisions of this
last will and testament, such distribution shall not be paid
outright to such beneficiary but shall be added to and become a
part of the trust so being administered for such beneficiary by
the Trustee.

                         Item V

                Distribution to Minor Children

 If any share of corpus of any trust established under this will
become distributable outright and free of trust to any
beneficiary before said beneficiary has attained the age of
eighteen (18) years, then said share shall immediately vest in
said beneficiary, but the Trustee shall retain possession of
such share during the period in which such beneficiary is under
the age of eighteen (18) years, and, in the meantime, shall use
and expend so much of the income and principal for the care,
support, and education of such beneficiary, and any income not
so expended with respect to each share so retained all the power
and discretion had with respect to such trust generally.

                          Item VI

                    Alternate Distributees

 In the event that all of my descendants should be deceased at
any time prior to the time for the termination of the trusts
provided for herein, then in such event all of my estate and all
the assets of every trust to be created hereunder (as the case
may be) shall then distributed outright in equal shares to my
heirs at law per stripes.

                         Item VII

                    Unenforceable Provisions

 If any provisions of this will are unenforceable, the remaining
provisions shall, nevertheless, be carried into effect.

                         Item VIII

                      Life Insurance

 If my estate is the beneficiary of any life insurance on my
life at the time of my death, I direct that the proceeds
therefrom will be used by my Executor in payment of the debts ,
expenses and taxes listed in Item I of this will, to the extent
deemed advisable by the Executor. All such proceeds not so used
are to be used by my Executor for the purpose of satisfying the
devises and bequests contained in Item IV herein.

                         Item IX

                    Spendthrift Provision

 I direct that the interest of any beneficiary in principal or
income of any trust created hereunder shall not be subject to
claims of creditors or others, nor to legal process, and may not
be voluntarily or involuntarily alienated or encumbered except as
herein provided. Any bequests contained herein for any female
shall be for her sole and separate use, free from the debts,
contracts and control of any husband she may ever have.

                         Item X

               Proceeds From Personal Services

 All sums paid after my death (either to my estate or to any of
the trusts created hereunder) and resulting from personal
services rendered by me during my lifetime, including, but not
limited to, royalties of all nature, concerts, motion picture
contracts, and personal appearances shall be considered to be
income, notwithstanding the provisions of estate and trust law
to the contrary.

                          Item XI

                    Executor and Trustee

 I appoint as executor of this, my last will and testament, and
as Trustee of every trust required to be created hereunder, my
said father.

 I hereby direct that my said father shall be entitled by his
last will ant testament, duly probated, to appoint a successor
Executor of my estate, as well as a successor Trustee or
successor Trustees of all the trusts to be created under my last
will and testament.

 If, for any reason, my said father be unable to serve or to
continue to serve as Executor and/or as Trustee, or if he be
deceased and shall not have appointed a successor Executor or
Trustee, by virtue of his last will and testament as stated
-above, then I appoint National Bank of Commerce, Memphis,
Tennessee, or its successor or the institution with which it may
merge, as successor Executor and/or as successor Trustee of all
trusts required to be established hereunder.

 None of the appointees named hereunder,including any appointment
made by virtue of the last will and testament of my said father,
shall be required to furnish any bond or security for
performance of the respective fiduciary duties required
hereunder, notwithstanding any rule of law to the contrary.

                         Item XII

 Powers, Duties, Privileges and Immunities of the Trustee

 Except as otherwise stated expressly to the contrary herein, I
give and grant to the said Trustee (and to the duly appointed
successor Trustee when acting as such) the power to do
everything he deems advisable with respect to the administration
of each trust required to be established under this, my last
will and Testament, even though such powers would not be
authorized or appropriate for the Trustee under statutory or
other rules of law. By way of illustration and not in
limitation of the generality of the foregoing grant of power and
authority of the Trustee, I give and grant to him plenary power
as follows:

 (a) To exercise all those powers authorized to fiduciaries under
the provisions of the Tennessee Code Annotated, Sections 35-616
to 35-618, inclusive, including any amendments thereto in effect
at the time of my death, and the same are expressly referred to
and incorporated herein by reference.

 (b) Plenary power is granted to the Trustee, not only to relieve
him from seeking judicial instruction, but to the extent that
the Trustee deems it to be prudent, to encourage determinations
freely to be made in favor of persons who are the current income
beneficiaries. In such instances the rights of all subsequent
beneficiaries are subordinate, and the Trustee shall not be
answerable to any subsequent beneficiary for anything done or
omitted in favor of a current income beneficiary may compel any
such favorable or preferential treatment. Without in anywise
minimizing or impairing the scope of this declaration of intent,
it includes investment policy, exercise of discretionary power
to pay or apply principal and income, and determination
principal and income questions;

 (c) It shall be lawful for the Trustee to apply any sum that is
payable to or for the benefit of a minor (or any other person
who in the Judgment of the Trustee, is incapable of making
proper disposition thereof) by payments in discharge of the
costs and expenses of educating, maintaining and supporting said
beneficiary, or to make payment to anyone with whom said
beneficiary resides or who has the care or custody of the
beneficiary, temporarily or permanently, all without
intervention of any guardian or like fiduciary. The receipt of
anyone to whom payment is so authorized to be made shall be a
complete discharge of the Trustees without obligation on his
part to see to the further application hereto, and without
regard to other resource that the beneficiary may have, or the
duty of any other person to support the beneficiary;

 (d) In Dealing with the Trustee, no grantee, pledge, vendee,
mortgage, lessee or other transference of the trust properties,
or any part therof, shall be bound to inquire with respect to
the purpose or necessity of any such disposition or to see to
the application of any consideration therefore paid to the
Trustee.

                            Item XIII

             Concerning the Trustee and the Executor

 (a) If at any time the Trustee shall have reasonable doubt as to
his power, authority or duty in the administration of any trust
herein created, it shall be lawful for the Trustee to obtain the
advice and counsel of reputable legal counsel without resorting
to the courts for instructions; and the Trustee shall be fully
absolved from all liability and damage or detriment to the
various trust estates of any beneficiary thereunder by reason of
anything done, suffered or omitted pursuant to advice of said
counsel given and obtained in good faith, provided that nothing
contained herein shall be construed to prohibit or prevent the
Trustee in all proper cases from applying to a court of
competent jurisdiction for instructions in the administration
of the trust assets in lieu of obtaining advice of counsel.

 (b) In managing, investing, and controlling the various trust
estates, the Trustee shall exercise the judgment and care under
the circumstances then prevailing, which men of prudence
discretion and judgment exercise in the management of their own
affairs, not in regard to speculation, but in regard to the
permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable
income as well as the probable safety of their capital, and, in
addition, the purchasing power of income distribution to
beneficiaries.

 (c) My Trustee (as well as my Executor) shall be entitled to
reasonable and adequate and adequate compensation for the
fiduciary services rendered by him.

 (d) My Executor and his successor Executor and his successor
Executor shall have the same rights, privileges, powers and
immunities herein granted to my Trustee wherever appropriate.

 (e) In referring to any fiduciary hereunder, for purposes of
construction, masculine pronouns may include a corporate
fiduciary and neutral pronouns may include an individual
fiduciary.

                        Item XIV

                  Law Against Perpetuities

 (a) Having in mind the rule against perpetuities, I direct that
(notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary in this last
will and testament) each trust created under this will (except
such trust created under this will (except such trusts as have
heretofore vested in compliance with such rule or law) shall
end, unless sooner terminated under other provisions of this
will, twenty-one (21) years after the death of the last survivor
of such of the beneficiaries hereunder as are living at the time
of my death; and thereupon that the property held in trust shall
be distributed free of all trust to the persons then entitled to
receive the income and/or principal therefrom, in the proportion
in proportion in which they are then entitled to receive such
income.

 (b) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this will to the
contrary, I direct that if any distribution under this will
become payable to a person for whom the Trustee is then
administering a trust created hereunder for the benefit of such
person, such distribution shall be made to such trust and not to
the beneficiary outright, and the funds so passing to such trust
shall become a part thereof as corpus and be administered and
distributed to the same extent and purpose as if such funds had
been a part of such a trust at its inception.

                         Item XV

             Payment of Estate and Inheritance Taxes

 Notwithstanding the provisions of Item X herein, I authorize my
Executor to use such sums received by my estate after my death
and resulting from my personal services as identified in Item X
as he deem necessary and advisable in order to pay the taxes
referred to in Item I of my said will.

 In WITNESS WHEREOF, I, the said ELVIS A. PRESLEY, do hereunto
set my hand and seal in the presence of two (2) competent
witnesses, and in their presence do publish and declare this
instrument to be my Last Will and Testament, this 3 day of

<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT>
<PRE> 
I, GEORGE HERMAN RUTH, being of sound and disposing mind, memory and
understanding, but mindful of the uncertainty of life, do hereby make,
declare and publish this to be my Last Will and Testament, hereby
revoking all other wills and codicils thereto be me at any time
heretofore made.

FIRST: I direct my Executors hereinafter named to pay all my just
debts and funeral expenses as soon after my death as may be
practicable.

SECOND: I give and bequeath to my wife, CLARA MAE RUTH, if she shall
survive me, all my household furniture, automobiles with the
appurtenances thereto, paintings, works of art, books, china,
glassware, silverware, linens, household furnishings and equipment of
any kind, clothing, jewelry, articles of personal wear and adornment
and personal effects, excepting however, souvenirs, mementoes,
pictures, scrap-books, manuscripts, letters, athletic equipment and
other personal property pertaining to baseball. In the event that my
wife, Clara Mae Ruth shall not survive me, I direct my Executors
hereinafter named to divide the said property between my daughters,
DOROTHY RUTH SULLIVAN and JULIA RUTH FLANDERS, as my said daughters
may agree, or in the event they are unable to agree, to divide the
said property between my said daughters as my Executors hereinafter
named may, in their absolute discretion determine. The determination
of my Executors as to the relative values of such property for the
purpose of dividing the same and in the making of such distribution
shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all persons interested
herein.

THIRD: I give and bequeath to my Executors hereinafter named or either
of them who may qualify, all my souvenirs, mementoes, pictures,
scrap-books, manuscripts, letters, athletic equipment and other
personal property pertaining to baseball, and I request but do not
direct my said Executors to divide the same among such persons,
corporations and organizations as I may from time to time request or
in such manner as they in their sole and uncontrolled discretion may
deem proper and fitting.

FOURTH: I give and bequeath to my wife, CLARA MAE RUTH, if she shall
survive me, to my daughter, DOROTHY RUTH SULLIVAN, if she shall
survive me, and to my daughter, JULIA RUTH FLANDERS, if she shall
survive me, each the sum of Five Thousand ($5,000.) Dollars.

FIFTH: I give and bequeath to my sister, MARY H. MOBERLY, now residing
in Baltimore, Maryland, if she shall survive me, the sum of Ten
Thousand ($10,000.) Dollars.

SIXTH: I give and bequeath to FRANK DELANEY, providing he is in my
employ at the time of my death, and to MARY REITH, providing she is in
my employ at the time of my death, each the sum of Five Hundred
($500.) Dollars.

SEVENTH: Under the provisions of a certain Indenture or Trust
Agreement made and executed by and between me and the President and
Directors of The Manhattan Company of 40 Wall Street, Borough of
Manhattan, City of New York, dated the 26th day of April, 1927, I
reserved the right to designate in and by my last will and testament a
new beneficiary to whom the income or principal of the trust fund
which is the subject of the said Trust Agreement, shall be paid after
my death in the place and stead of my daughter, Dorothy Ruth Sullivan,
and my next of kin. Pursuant to such reserved right and in the
exercise thereof, I hereby declare and direct that the income and
principal of the said trust shall be paid after my death as follows:

A. The income of the said trust fund shall be paid to my wife, CLARA
MAE RUTH, during the term of said trust or the life of my said wife,
CLARA MAE RUTH, whichever may be the shorter period. After the death
of my wife, CLARA MAE RUTH, the income of the said trust during the
remainder of the term thereof shall be divided equally between my
daughters, DOROTHY RUTH SULLIVAN and JULIA RUTH FLANDERS. If JULIA
RUTH FLANDERS shal be deceased, the income which she would have
received had she been alive, shall be paid to her issue per stirpes
and not per capita, or if there be no issue of said JULIA RUTH
FLANDERS then living, all of the income of the said trust shall be
paid to my daughter, DOROTHY RUTH SULLIVAN.

B. Upon the termination of the said trust during the lifetime of my
wife, CLARA MAE RUTH, I direct the Trustee thereof to purchase from an
insuranc ecompany authorized to do business in the State of New York,
a refund annuity which will pay to my wife, CLARA MAE RUTH, during her
lifetime, in equal monthly installments the annual amount of Six
Thousand ($6,000.) Dollars, and I further direct the Trustee of the
said trust to divide the remainder of the principal of the said trust
fund, including any refund payable upon the annuity hereinbefore
required to be purchased for the benefit of my wife, CLARA MAE RUTH,
into two (2) equal parts; and

(1) To pay one of such equal parts to the issue then living of my
daughter, DOROTHY RUTH SULLIVAN, or if she shall leave no issue then
surviving, among such persons and in such manner as she may be her
last will and testament direct; and

(2) To pay the other of such equal parts to my daughter, JULIA RUTH
FLANDERS, if she be then living, or if she be not living, to her issue
then surviving, or if she shall leave no issue then surviving, among
such persons and in such manner as she may by her last will and
testament direct.

EIGHTH: All the rest, residue and remainder of my property and estate,
real, personal and mixed, of whatsoever kind, nature or description
and wheresoever situate, of which I may die seized and/or possessed or
over which I may have any power of disposition or to which I or my
estate may be entitled, I give devise and bequeath to my Trustees
hereinafter named IN TRUST NEVERTHELESS for the following uses and
purposes:

A. To collect and receive the rents, income and profits thereof and to
pay the same to my wife, CLARA MAE RUTH, as long as she shall live. B.
Upon the death of my wife, CLARA MAE RUTH, or upon my death, if she
shall predecease me, I direct my Trustees to pay over, transfer,
convey and deliver the principal then remaining in the said trust as
follows:

(1) Ten percent (10%) thereof to THE BABE RUTH FOUNDATION, INC., a
corporation organized under the Membership Corporations Law of the
State of New York and dedicated to the interests of the kids of
America. (2) Forty-five percent (45%) thereof to my daughter, DOROTHY
RUTH SULLIVAN, if she be then alive, or if she be not then alive, to
her then surviving issue per stirpes and not per capita, or if she
leave no issue then surviving, to such persons and in such manner as
she may by her last will and testament direct. (3) Forty-five percent
(45%) thereof to my daughter, JULIA RUTH FLANDERS, if she be then
alive, or if she be not then alive, to her then surviving issue per
stirpes and not per capita, or if she leave no issue then surviving,
to such persons and in such manner as she by her last will and
testament direct.

NINTH: I nominate, constitute and appoint J. PAUL CAREY, II and MELVYN
GORDON LOWENSTEIN, and the survivor of them, as Executors of and
Trustees under this my Last Will and Testament. Within ninety (90)
days from the date upon which one of the above named Executors or
Trustees shall first act as sole Executor or sole Trustee of this my
Last Will and testament, I direct him, by an instrument in writing
duly signed and acknowledged and suitable for recording in the State
of New York, to appoint a bank or a trust company which has conducted
active business operations in the State of New York for at least 25
years, or which is the successor to a bank or trust company organized
under the laws of the State of New York or the United States of
America more than 25 years prior to the date of such appointment, to
be and become a co-Executor and/or a co-Trustee. In the event that
such sole acting Executor or sole acting Trustee shall not have
appointed a bank or a trust company as co-Executor or Co-Trustee
hereunder, as hereinabove directed and within the period hereinabove
specified, then I nominate, constitute and appoint THE CHASE NATIONAL
BANK OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK, as co-Executor and co-Trustee of this my
Last Will and Testament.

TENTH: I direct that if and when any part of the principal or income
of any share or portion of my estate shall become payable to any
beneficiary who is an infant, such principal or income shall
absolutely vest in and belong to such infant, but payment thereof may
be deferred, and I authorize my Executors and Trustees, as the case
may be, in their sole and uncontrolled discretion, to hold the share
of such infant and to retain the custody and control thereof and to
administer the same and invest and reinvest such share or portion and
the accumulated income therefrom, if any, with all the powers granted
in this my Last Will and Testament to the Executors and Trustees, and
my Executors and Trustees are further directed to apply such part of
the income and principal thereof as in their discretion they may deem
necessary and proper for the maintenance, support and education of
such infant during minority, and upon such infant attaining majority,
to pay over to such infant whatever part of such principal and income
and any accumulated income thereon which may then remain in the hands
of my said Executors or Trustees, as the case may be. Such application
of principal or income, in the discretion of my said Executors or
Trustees may be made wholly or in part by said Executors or Trustees
paying directly the expenses for the maintenance, support and
education of such infant, or by paying such principal or income to
such infant or to an adult person of my Executors' or Trustees'
selection deemed by them to be the most likely person to make proper
application of such principal or income for the infant's benefit; the
receipt of the person to whom such payment is made to be a sufficient
voucher and discharge to my said Executors or Trustees, as the case
may be, for all payments so made by them.

ELEVENTH: In addition to the powers conferred upon my Executors and
Trustees by law, or herein elsewhere conferred upon them, I hereby
authorize and empower them and successors (a) to retain any
investments which I may have at the time of my death, and to invest
and reinvest any trusts funds coming into their hands in any stocks,
bonds, securities or other property, real or personal, which they in
their discretion deem advisable, whether such investments be
authorized by the laws of any state or jurisdiction or not, and to
hold the same as long as they may deem advisable, with full power to
sell and reinvest, and to change securities and investments as they
deem best; (b) for the purpose of partitioning or distributing the
funds of my estate, and for any other purpose whatsoever, to grant,
bargain, sell, convey, mortgage, lease, exchange, or otherwise dispose
of, as and when they or their successors may deem expedient, any and
all property, real, personal or mixed, of which I may be seized or
possessed or in or to which I may be in any manner interested or
entitled at the time of my death, or of which they may be seized or
possessed, entitled to or interested in, as my Executors or Trustees,
and upon such disposition thereof, to execute, acknowledge and deliver
all necessary and proper deeds or instruments of conveyance for the
vesting in the purchases, mortgagee, lessee, or other transferee
thereof, the title thereto, in fee or otherwise, and I hereby direct
that upon any such disposition thereof, my Executors or Trustees, or
the successors of any of them, may take the consideration agreed upon,
wholly or partly, in cash, stocks, bonds, notes or any securities
which they or their successors shall determine upon, and I expressly
direct that no purchases, mortgagee, lessee, or other transferee
thereof shall be bound to see to the application of money or other
thing of value paid or given therefor; (c) whenever my Executors or
Trustees, or the successors of any of them, are required, or shall
determine to divide the principal of my estate held by them into
shares, so to divide the same without converting it into money, but in
their discretion by apportioning the property held, whether the same
shall be producing income or not, to such different parts or shares,
in such manner as they shall deem fairly and equitably to bring about
the division directed or determined upon, the judgment of my said
Executors or Trustees concerning the priority of any allotment or
distribution of property hereunder shall be final and binding upon all
persons interested in my estate, and the determination of my Executors
or Trustees as to the value of any such property shall be
presumptively correct and shall be final and binding upon all persons
in interest, unless clear and convincing proof is adduced showing
gross error on the part of my said Executors or Trustees; (d) to
consent to and participate in the reorganization, consolidation,
merger or other capital readjustment of any corporation, the stocks,
bonds or other securities of which they may hold, and to do all things
whatsoever necessary, advisable or expedient to enable them to secure
the benefits of such reorganization, consolidation, merger or other
capital readjustment, including particularly the sale or purchase of
any rights incident thereto, and the payment of any amounts necessary.
Investments made through the exercise of any such rights, or the
proceeds received at the sale thereof, shall be considered principal.

I also further authorize my Executors or Trustees, as the case may be,
to vote upon and give proxies to vote upon, any stocks or bonds of
corporations that may be owned by me at the time of my death or
subsequently acquired by them, upon any question that may lawfully be
submitted to the vote of the stockholders or bondholders of such
corporation, and in their discretion to subject any such stocks to
voting trust agreements, and to accept voting trust certificates in
exchange therefor. It is my will and intention that in dealing with
the affairs and securities of any corporation in which I shall be
interested at the time of my death, either as creditor or stockholder,
or with the affairs and securities of any corporation in which my
Executors or Trustees, as the case may be, may at any time be
interested on behalf of my estate, as creditors or stockholders, my
said Executors or Trustees, as the case may be, shall have and may
exercise all of the powers that might lawfully be exercised by an
individual owning said stock or obligation and acting in his own right
and interest.

The Trustees shall be authorized to hold such sum or sums uninvested
as they shall see fit.

The Trustees may hold the trust estate or any part thereof as an
undivided whole, without separation as between the trusts hereby
created, but no such holding shall defer the vesting of any estate in
possession, or otherwise, according to the terms hereof.

The Trustees are hereby authorized and empowered to employ such person
or persons to assist them in the management and administration of the
estate, in an advisory capacity or otherwise, as they shall deem in
their sole discretion to be for the best interests of the trust estate
and to fix and pay the compensation therefor.

I direct that my Executors and Trustees shall not be required to lay
apart any portion of the income or any of the said trust funds for the
purpose of keeping the principal thereof intact, or for the purpose of
making good any amount paid in premiums on the purchase of securities.

All cash dividends or other cash distributions received from any
mining stocks or other wasting investments whether or not of the same
kind (notwithstanding such cash dividends or distributions may have
been designated or described by the disburser thereof to be in whole
or in part a return of capital or a distribution from depletion
reserves and whether or not they may be extraordinary dividends or
distributions), shall be treated as income without setting apart any
portions of such dividends or distributions to maintain intact the
principal of any trust fund provided for hereunder. All extraordinary
stock dividends and all realized appreciation in the value of stocks,
bonds, securities or other property, resulting from the sale or other
disposition thereof, shall be considered principal and not income, but
ordinary stock dividends paid regularly by a corporation in lieu of,
or in addition to regular cash dividends shall be considered income
and not principal, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Trustees' determination
as to whether any dividend should be apportioned or allocated in whole
or in part to principal or income, shall be conclusive and binding
upon all persons now or hereafter interested in the trust estate.

I hereby expressly declare that my Executors or Trustees, as the case
may be, whichever shall assume to act in the premises, shall have full
power to settle and determine all questions which may arise as to my
estate, including the power to settle, adjust, compromise or refer to
arbitration, any and all claims in favor or or against my estate and
to receive and make payment thereof according to such arbitration,
settlement, adjustment and compromise, and all the acts of said
Executors and/or Trustees in that regard shall be final and
conclusive.

I further direct that no bond, undertaking or other security
whatsoever, shall be required of my Executors and Trustees, or their
successors in any jurisdiction whatsoever, for the discharge of any of
their duties hereunder, or for or upon the doing any act which they
are empowered to do under or by virtue of the provisions of this my
Last Will, or under or by virtue of any law or authority whatsoever.

Except as otherwise herein provided, all of the powers and authority
herein conferred, including discretionary power, may be exercised by
such of my Executors and Trustees as may qualify, and by the survivor,
survivors and successors of them.

The words ``income'' and ``profits'' as used in this my Last Will are
not intended to include profits realized upon the sale of any of the
assets constituting the principal of my estate. Such profits are to
treated as accretions to principal.

In the event that any person named as a legatee under this my Last
Will and Testament shall die simultaneously with me, or in or as a
result of a common disaster, or in the event that there may be a
question as to the survivorship of such person or myself, then for all
purposes and intents under this my Last Will and Testament such person
shall be deemed to have predeceased me.

TWELFTH: I direct that any Federal or state income tax which may
become due from my estate by reason of the profits or accretions which
shall accrue to the principal of any trust fund hereunder shall be
paid by my Trustees out of the principal of such trust fund and shall
not be charged against or paid from the income of any beneficiary of
any trust fund under this my Last Will.

THIRTEENTH: I direct that all estate, transfer, succession,
inheritance, legacy and similar taxes upon or with respect to so much
of my estate as passes by, through or under Paragraphs SECOND, THIRD,
FOURTH, FIFTH, SIXTH and EIGHTH of this my Last Will, shall be paid
out of my residuary estate and there shall be no proration of any such
taxes, and I further direct that so much of such estate, transfer,
succession, inheritance, legacy and similar taxes as may be assessed
against my estate by reason of the inclusion for estate tax purposes
of the trust referred to under Paragraph SEVENTH of this my Last Will,
or any other assets not passing by, through or under this my Last
Will, shall be apportioned to such trust and assets and shall be
charged to and paid therefrom.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto to this, my Last Will and
Testament, set my hand and seal this 9th day of August, in the year
One Thousand, Nine Hundred and Forty-eight.

ELEVENTH: In addition to the powers conferred upon my Executors and Trustees by law, or herein elsewhere conferred upon them, I hereby authorize and empower them and successors (a) to retain any investments which I may have at the time of my death, and to invest and reinvest any trusts funds coming into their hands in any stocks, bonds, securities or other property, real or personal, which they in their discretion deem advisable, whether such investments be authorized by the laws of any state or jurisdiction or not, and to hold the same as long as they may deem advisable, with full power to sell and reinvest, and to change securities and investments as they deem best; (b) for the purpose of partitioning or distributing the funds of my estate, and for any other purpose whatsoever, to grant, bargain, sell, convey, mortgage, lease, exchange, or otherwise dispose of, as and when they or their successors may deem expedient, any and all property, real, personal or mixed, of which I may be seized or possessed or in or to which I may be in any manner interested or entitled at the time of my death, or of which they may be seized or possessed, entitled to or interested in, as my Executors or Trustees, and upon such disposition thereof, to execute, acknowledge and deliver all necessary and proper deeds or instruments of conveyance for the vesting in the purchases, mortgagee, lessee, or other transferee thereof, the title thereto, in fee or otherwise, and I hereby direct that upon any such disposition thereof, my Executors or Trustees, or the successors of any of them, may take the consideration agreed upon, wholly or partly, in cash, stocks, bonds, notes or any securities which they or their successors shall determine upon, and I expressly direct that no purchases, mortgagee, lessee, or other transferee thereof shall be bound to see to the application of money or other thing of value paid or given therefor; (c) whenever my Executors or Trustees, or the successors of any of them, are required, or shall determine to divide the principal of my estate held by them into shares, so to divide the same without converting it into money, but in their discretion by apportioning the property held, whether the same shall be producing income or not, to such different parts or shares, in such manner as they shall deem fairly and equitably to bring about the division directed or determined upon, the judgment of my said Executors or Trustees concerning the priority of any allotment or distribution of property hereunder shall be final and binding upon all persons interested in my estate, and the determination of my Executors or Trustees as to the value of any such property shall be presumptively correct and shall be final and binding upon all persons in interest, unless clear and convincing proof is adduced showing gross error on the part of my said Executors or Trustees; (d) to consent to and participate in the reorganization, consolidation, merger or other capital readjustment of any corporation, the stocks, bonds or other securities of which they may hold, and to do all things whatsoever necessary, advisable or expedient to enable them to secure the benefits of such reorganization, consolidation, merger or other capital readjustment, including particularly the sale or purchase of any rights incident thereto, and the payment of any amounts necessary. Investments made through the exercise of any such rights, or the proceeds received at the sale thereof, shall be considered principal.

I also further authorize my Executors or Trustees, as the case may be, to vote upon and give proxies to vote upon, any stocks or bonds of corporations that may be owned by me at the time of my death or subsequently acquired by them, upon any question that may lawfully be submitted to the vote of the stockholders or bondholders of such corporation, and in their discretion to subject any such stocks to voting trust agreements, and to accept voting trust certificates in exchange therefor. It is my will and intention that in dealing with the affairs and securities of any corporation in which I shall be interested at the time of my death, either as creditor or stockholder, or with the affairs and securities of any corporation in which my Executors or Trustees, as the case may be, may at any time be interested on behalf of my estate, as creditors or stockholders, my said Executors or Trustees, as the case may be, shall have and may exercise all of the powers that might lawfully be exercised by an individual owning said stock or obligation and acting in his own right and interest.

The Trustees shall be authorized to hold such sum or sums uninvested as they shall see fit.

The Trustees may hold the trust estate or any part thereof as an undivided whole, without separation as between the trusts hereby created, but no such holding shall defer the vesting of any estate in possession, or otherwise, according to the terms hereof.

The Trustees are hereby authorized and empowered to employ such person or persons to assist them in the management and administration of the estate, in an advisory capacity or otherwise, as they shall deem in their sole discretion to be for the best interests of the trust estate and to fix and pay the compensation therefor.

I direct that my Executors and Trustees shall not be required to lay apart any portion of the income or any of the said trust funds for the purpose of keeping the principal thereof intact, or for the purpose of making good any amount paid in premiums on the purchase of securities.

All cash dividends or other cash distributions received from any mining stocks or other wasting investments whether or not of the same kind (notwithstanding such cash dividends or distributions may have been designated or described by the disburser thereof to be in whole or in part a return of capital or a distribution from depletion reserves and whether or not they may be extraordinary dividends or distributions), shall be treated as income without setting apart any portions of such dividends or distributions to maintain intact the principal of any trust fund provided for hereunder. All extraordinary stock dividends and all realized appreciation in the value of stocks, bonds, securities or other property, resulting from the sale or other disposition thereof, shall be considered principal and not income, but ordinary stock dividends paid regularly by a corporation in lieu of, or in addition to regular cash dividends shall be considered income and not principal, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Trustees' determination as to whether any dividend should be apportioned or allocated in whole or in part to principal or income, shall be conclusive and binding upon all persons now or hereafter interested in the trust estate.

I hereby expressly declare that my Executors or Trustees, as the case may be, whichever shall assume to act in the premises, shall have full power to settle and determine all questions which may arise as to my estate, including the power to settle, adjust, compromise or refer to arbitration, any and all claims in favor or or against my estate and to receive and make payment thereof according to such arbitration, settlement, adjustment and compromise, and all the acts of said Executors and/or Trustees in that regard shall be final and conclusive.

I further direct that no bond, undertaking or other security whatsoever, shall be required of my Executors and Trustees, or their successors in any jurisdiction whatsoever, for the discharge of any of their duties hereunder, or for or upon the doing any act which they are empowered to do under or by virtue of the provisions of this my Last Will, or under or by virtue of any law or authority whatsoever.

Except as otherwise herein provided, all of the powers and authority herein conferred, including discretionary power, may be exercised by such of my Executors and Trustees as may qualify, and by the survivor, survivors and successors of them.

The words ``income'' and ``profits'' as used in this my Last Will are not intended to include profits realized upon the sale of any of the assets constituting the principal of my estate. Such profits are to treated as accretions to principal.

In the event that any person named as a legatee under this my Last Will and Testament shall die simultaneously with me, or in or as a result of a common disaster, or in the event that there may be a question as to the survivorship of such person or myself, then for all purposes and intents under this my Last Will and Testament such person shall be deemed to have predeceased me.

TWELFTH: I direct that any Federal or state income tax which may become due from my estate by reason of the profits or accretions which shall accrue to the principal of any trust fund hereunder shall be paid by my Trustees out of the principal of such trust fund and shall not be charged against or paid from the income of any beneficiary of any trust fund under this my Last Will.

THIRTEENTH: I direct that all estate, transfer, succession, inheritance, legacy and similar taxes upon or with respect to so much of my estate as passes by, through or under Paragraphs SECOND, THIRD, FOURTH, FIFTH, SIXTH and EIGHTH of this my Last Will, shall be paid out of my residuary estate and there shall be no proration of any such taxes, and I further direct that so much of such estate, transfer, succession, inheritance, legacy and similar taxes as may be assessed against my estate by reason of the inclusion for estate tax purposes of the trust referred to under Paragraph SEVENTH of this my Last Will, or any other assets not passing by, through or under this my Last Will, shall be apportioned to such trust and assets and shall be charged to and paid therefrom.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto to this, my Last Will and Testament, set my hand and seal this 9th day of August, in the year One Thousand, Nine Hundred and Forty-eight.

In February 1987, she began writing for The Daily Report, the Atlanta newspaper owned by American Lawyer Media, and won several journalism awards there before joining Court TV about a year before it went on air.
<P>Since then, she's covered more than 30 Georgia trials, incuding Mosely v. General Motors -- the pick-up truck gas tanks case -- and two murder cases against police officers -- Georgia v. Cassotta and Georgia v. Chapel. Okrasinski also recently covered the Black Crowes civil case -- Is a pie chart a contract? -- and the Mickler wrongful death trial, where the family of a gospel singer killed by a semi was awarded $5 million.

<H3>Court TV Study Guide For September 1996 Class Action Program:<BR>
National High School Mock Trial Championship</H3>

<P>CLASS ACTION AIRS ON COURT TV EVERY SATURDAY AT 4AM ET</P>

<b>Description</B><BR>
Get an inside look at how a top team prepares for the final championship and experiences the ups and downs of  competition. Then watch the highlights of the final round between the two best mock trial teams in the nation. Students act as both the attorneys and the witnesses while arguing this year's case, Cambria Iron Company v. The South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club (The Johnstown Flood).<P>

<B>Purpose</B><BR>
This program can be used in two ways:<br>
@ As an example of high school students using their public speaking ability and their knowledge of the law to compete in a mock trial competition.<br>
@As a springboard for discussion on liability and negligence. <br>
After watching the competition students will have heard arguments on both sides of the case.<p>

<B>The Case</b><br>
The Cambria Iron Company alleges that the South Fork Club did not properly maintain its dam and when the worst flood in 100 years hit, the dam collapsed and destroyed the entire town. The Iron company says the resulting damage was preventable and entirely the fault of the Club. The Club argues that no man is nature's master, the dam was properly maintained and that no dam could have withstood the flood.<p>


<B>The Competition</B><BR>
In the championship round each team must be prepared to argue either side, the plaintiff or the defense. In this competition the Michigan team argued the plaintiff's case and Arizona the defense. Each side presented opening and closing statements and three witnesses. Everyone in the competition is a high school student.<P>

<B>Breakdown</B><BR>
Segment 1:<BR>
Meet the Delaware team and watch them start to strategize for the competition and enjoy their time off in Pittsburgh.<P>

Segment 2<BR>
Round one of the competition. Watch as Delaware meets Michigan. Both of these teams are very strong and only one will advance to the finals.<P>

Segments 3, 4 and 5<BR>
The final round of competition, Michigan vs. Arizona.<P>

Segment 6<BR>
The announcement of the winners and the awards banquet.    <P>

<B>Discussion Before Viewing</B><BR>
Discuss how a trial works. Start with opening statements, talk about how attorneys question a witness and then discuss closing statements.<P>

What is the difference between a civil trial and a criminal trial?<P>

In this case the plaintiff had to prove negligence on the part of the defense. What does that entail?<P>

How are liability laws different today than they were 100 years ago?<P>

Do you believe clubs and companies have an obligation to create safe environments and products or is it the consumer's responsibility (or in this case the town's), to make sure the environment/product is safe? Should the town have built its own dam or should it have forced the South  Fork Club to fix its dam?<P>

<B>Discussing After Viewing</B><BR>
Did watching the trial change your original opinion of the case?<P>

If this case happened today instead of 100 years ago, what do you think the outcome would be?<P>

Do you think the South Fork Club  members' status in the community affected the verdict? Do you think it would today? Think of current trials where celebrities or wealthy people went on trial. Do you think their celebrity status affected the outcome of the trial?<P>

<H3>Court TV Study Guide For October 1996 Class Action Program:<BR>
AIDS: Its Side Effects on America </H3>

<P>CLASS ACTION AIRS ON COURT TV EVERY SATURDAY AT 4AM ET</P>

<b>Purpose</b><br>
A chance to get an inside look at how people in our society have been challenged by and have faced AIDS and HIV. To examine how this disease has changed the way we look at our laws, our society, and our responsibility both as a society and as individuals.<p>

<b>Discussion Before Viewing</b><br>
Discuss the difference between AIDS and HIV: AIDS is the disease, and HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. People who are HIV positive can appear to be perfectly healthy for up to ten years before showing any signs of AIDS. Who do you have to tell? Who should you tell? Do you have to tell your employer? Do you have to tell your doctor? Is there a difference between who legally needs to know and who should know?  How would being HIV positive affect your behavior?	<p>

<b>Segment 1: The Diagnosis</b><br>
Vernelle Lowder was diagnosed with AIDS. The health center told her she had AIDS, not just that she was HIV positive. Two years after the diagnosis, after making major changes to her life, she discovered she did not have the disease nor did she test HIV positive. So, she sued the clinic and the lab for the misdiagnosis. <p>

<b>Discussion:</b> Legally the clinic is not required to tell a patient, who tests positive, to get a retest. However, the standard practice for HIV testing labs is to recommend a retest when the results are positive. Who was responsible for the misdiagnosis? Should Lowder have asked for a retest or should the health center have suggested it? Should the Health Center be held responsible in a court of law for a misdiagnosis? <p>

<b>Segment 2: A Real Life "Philadelphia"</b><br>
In this segment you meet Scott Doe. When Scott filed the lawsuit he used the pseudonym John Doe to remain anonymous. Then, his lawyer recommended he use his given first name, instead of the pseudonym, so that the jury would relate to him on a more personal level.<p>

Scott Doe sued his law firm for discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act. He said the firm found out he was HIV positive and fired him. They said it had nothing to do with his disease, rather that his work was unsatisfactory. In this segment, Scott Doe takes the stand and tells his side of the story.<p>

<b>Discussion:</b> The Americans with Disabilities Act protects disabled workers from discrimination by their employers. But it had never been used to protect a person with the AIDS virus. Scott Doe challenged the definition of this law when he brought this lawsuit. The judge ruled in his favor. He said people who are HIV positive are disabled even when they do not have AIDS. Do you think this was a fair ruling? Can you think of other instances when this law could be used? Does your state have additional laws protecting the disabled?<p>

<b>Segment 3: A Real Life "Philadelphia" (continued)</b><br>
Scott Doe is cross examined by the defense. Next, his boss Steven Asher takes the stand and tells the law firm's side of the story. He claims Scott Doe's work was unsatisfactory, therefore he was fired. <p>

<b>Discussion:</b> Who do you believe? Essentially, this lawsuit pits Scott Doe's word against his boss' word. How will the jury decide? Discuss the affects of HIV on Scott's professional life.   <p>

<b>Segment 4: "Who Can You Trust?" and "Helping or Harming?"</b><br>
Two different cases are explored in this segment. Alberto Gonzalez was charged with attempted murder. He allegedly knew he was HIV positive, had unprotected sex with a woman, and infected her with HIV.<p>

Next we meet a man who was giving out clean needles and syringes to injection drug users. Joseph McGrath says it was necessary for him to break the law in order to save people from spreading HIV and AIDS through dirty needles.<p>

<b>Discussion:</b> Both societal and individual responsibilities are questioned in each of these cases. Ask your class who should have taken responsibility in these two situations. Ask your students to think about how each of them can be affected by people who don't take precautions. <p>

<b>Segment 5</b><br>
Finally, we meet police officers, a doctor, and a managing partner in a gym who tell us how HIV and AIDS have changed their daily jobs. Through these professionals, with help from Scott Doe, Court TV takes you into their lives to talk about the issues surrounding HIV and AIDS in the workplace. <p>

<b>Discussion:</b> Ask your students if they have noticed any changes within their lives. What about teachers within the school? Have teachers and students learned about universal precautions? What are universal precautions?<p>

<b>Segment 6</b><br>
A wrap-up of everything we have seen and the outcome of each of these four cases.<p>

<b>Discussion After Viewing</b><br>
In each of these cases, the question of individual and societal responsibility is addressed. Explore these notions. Ask your students to look at each case to decide who was responsible and how the law should have handled it. You can debate both sides of the issue by dividing your class into teams. <p>

AIDS/HIV is an epidemic in our society. How does this disease fit into history? Think about other epidemics and diseases that have forced us to change the way we live. For example: TB and the bubonic plague. Compare these diseases to AIDS and look at their history.  <p>

<b>Suggested Activity</b><br>
Invite a professional from your community into your class to talk about their experience with HIV and AIDS. Has it changed their daily lives? If so, in what ways? Call a local AIDS organization in your community and invite the Executive Director to your school to explain universal precautions and the reasons for implementing them.<p.

Research Project: Have your students call the state prosecutor's office, the district attorney or the county attorney, and ask them if any AIDS/HIV-related cases have gone through their system. Use the people just seen as example cases. Has anyone ever been tried for attempted murder for spreading the virus, like Alberto Gonzalez? What are the laws about distributing clean needles? Can you buy hypodermic needles over the counter?  <p>

<H3>Court TV Study Guide For November 1996 Class Action Program:<BR>
Getting Physical: How Relationship Abuse is Affecting Teenagers</H3>

<P>CLASS ACTION AIRS ON COURT TV EVERY SATURDAY AT 4AM ET</P>

<b>Purpose</b><br>
To provoke discussion in the classroom and possibly outside of the classroom regarding relationship abuse. Can this be happening to your students  and how can you get them to talk about it if it is?<p>

<b>Brief Discussion Before Viewing</b><br>
Discuss the concept of relationship abuse and how it may escalate into violence. Talk to your students about what they have seen in their relationships or in the relationships of their friends, and what they think is acceptable behavior. Then compare what they said before the show to their thoughts after the show. Did their views change?<p>

<b>Legal Issues For Discussion After Viewing</b><br>
In the case of MA vs. Fuller, Jamie Fuller killed his 14 -year -old girlfriend, Amy Carnivale. Mark DeMeule, one of Jamie's friends, was present at the time of Carnivale's murder. He was not charged with accessory to a crime in exchange for his testimony against Jamie Fuller. Do you agree with that? Do you believe he should be punished in some other way?<p>

Do you think there should be stricter laws pertaining to relationship abuse? What is the difference between a boyfriend and girlfriend hitting each other and two strangers hitting each other? What is assault?<p>

As you know, the O.J. Simpson double murder trial has brought the issue of domestic violence to the forefront of the case. Do the students realize that relationship abuse can turn into domestic violence? Do they believe the laws regarding domestic abuse cases should be more stringent?<p>

<b>Social Issues For Discussion After Viewing</b><br>
What do you think about teenage dating? Do you think teenagers are becoming more abusive in their relationships? If so, why? What has brought about the change in teenage dating? Do you think alcohol plays a role?<p>

What did the students think about the excerpts from the play, "Hitting Home?"   Discuss the messages they got from the show. Do you think they understood the message of the play? Did they seem to want to see the play performed at their school?<p>

How did they react to the characters? Did they relate to their problems and anxieties? Do you think males and females react differently to the show?<p>

What is and isn't acceptable behavior between boyfriends and girlfriends? And what are the responsibilities of each one when the behavior is not acceptable?<p>

<b>Suggested Activity</b><br>
If the program seemed to have an effect on the students, maybe you can expand the issue. Try bringing in a counselor from a local shelter to personalize the problem and show them that relationship and domestic abuse are out there.<p>

<H3>Court TV Study Guide For December 1996 Class Action Program:<BR>
A White Supremacist on Trial: Murder or Self-Defense?</H3>

<P>CLASS ACTION AIRS ON COURT TV EVERY SATURDAY AT 4AM ET</P>

<b>Purpose</b><br>
To familiarize students with the legal issues of self-defense, premeditation and hate crimes, and to provoke discussion on whether a defendant's racial views can affect a jury's decision.<p>

<b>Brief Discussion Before Viewing</b><br>
Outline the basic details of the incident without making references to the race or employment of the two men involved. Do the students think George Loeb could have been acting in self-defense? Add the information that Loeb is white and Harold Mansfield is black. Do their views change? Now add that Loeb is a white supremacist and Mansfield was a Navy veteran just back from the Gulf War. Do these details make a difference? Should they?<p>

Discuss with students what they think premeditation means. How do they think a prosecutor proves a killing was premeditated?<p>

Review the four possible verdicts for this case: First Degree Murder (a premeditated killing); Second Degree Murder (intentional killing, but without premeditation); Manslaughter (killing with reckless disregard for human life); and Not Guilty (acted in self-defense). Review again after watching all the testimony and hearing the judge's definition of premeditation, but before the verdict is announced. How would the students vote if they were the jury? After the verdict discuss ways in which their views compare with those of the jury.<p>

<b>Legal Issues For Discussion After Viewing</b><br>
The judge determined before the trial started that he would allow evidence concerning Loeb's racial views to be admitted at the trial under the condition that they not become the focus of the trial. Why would some judges determine this evidence to be too "prejudicial" and not allow it? What does "prejudicial" mean? If the judge had not allowed Loeb's racial views as evidence in court, would the verdict have been different? If so, was it fair to allow it?<p>

The defense attorney had to make the decision on whether or not Loeb should take the stand in his own defense. Discuss the balance between the jury wanting to hear what happened directly from the defendant versus "opening the door" for the prosecution to bring in evidence concerning Loeb's background and asking him difficult questions on cross examination. Do you think Loeb helped or hindered his case by testifying?<p>

Some jury members stated after the verdict that they were not influenced by Loeb's racial views, but convicted him based on the eyewitnesses' testimony. Compare the eyewitnesses for the prosecution and the defense. Why did the jury consider the former to be more persuasive?<p>

How does a "premeditated" killing differ from a "planned" killing? In the judge's instructions to the jury, he states: "Killing with premeditation is killing after consciously deciding to do so. The decision must be present in the mind at the time of the killing. The law does not fix the exact period of time that must pass between the formation of the premeditated intent to kill and the killing."  How did the prosecution convince the jury that the killing was premeditated? What does it mean to say that George Loeb's motivation was premeditated?<p>

Loeb testified that he fled from Jacksonville after the shooting because he had no confidence in the criminal justice system. Does that affect your opinion about whether he is guilty or not?<p>

<b>Social Issues For Discussion</b><br>
What are "hate crimes?"  What are some examples of crimes that would fall under this category? Have there been incidents at your school that could be considered to be motivated by hate? How does your school treat such incidents? Why do you think these types of crimes are on the rise?<p>

How close to Loeb do you think Mansfield would have to be in order to feel Loeb was justified in shooting him? Are there any other actions Loeb could have taken instead of shooting Mansfield if he felt his life was threatened? Or do you think, as Loeb claims, he "had no other choice?"<p>

Did the fact that Mansfield returned to the parking lot with a friend after the first argument contribute to his own death? Is there such a thing as "he asked for it?"  Is that a justification for killing someone?<p>

Loeb's attorney admits that he does not share his client's racial views. How can he then represent him in this trial? Do attorneys have to "like" their clients? Should they believe they are not guilty?<p>

<b>Suggested Activity</b><br>
Many states have hate crime statutes. Find out if your state does, and what types of crimes fall into that category and how the penalties differ. Contact the nearest local office of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the NAACP for information. (Most cities will have a local office; if not, contact the ADL in New York City -- they will send information and let you know if there is an office near you.) If so, invite a representative to come and speak to the class about the growing incidence of hate crimes, and how the courts in your state treats them.<p>

<h2>Welcome to the Seminar</h2>
<!--- full_start: 631--->
<H2>Corporate Compliance: Standards For The 21st Century</h2>







<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3>











Over the next few weeks, lawyers on <A HREF="http://www.counsel.com/about.htm">LEXIS&#174  Counsel Connect<font size=-2><tt>(tm)</tt></font></A>, 







the largest online communications network for lawyers are participating in a special seminar devoted to a discussion of  "corporate compliance."







You are invited to "listen in" on the discussion here, and <a href=../../../../download/seminars/form1.html>submit proposed questions</a> to the participants. Here







is the introduction to the seminar as posted online for the lawyers on Lexis Counsel Connect.















<H3>Corporate Compliance Standards Project</h3>















The <A HREF="http://www.pacificrim.net/~ncpl/">National Center for Preventive Law (NCPL)</a> 







has begun a project that will produce a set of published "standards" for







corporate compliance programs.  The need for such standards stems







from the promulgation of the <EM>Federal Sentencing Guidelines for







Organizations</em> in 1991. Those Guidelines established that the







existence of an "effective compliance program" within an organization







would be an important factor in mitigating the consequences to the







organization for violations of criminal laws. The Guidelines,







however, offer little concrete direction as to what constitutes an







"effective compliance program." Organizations cannot look to decided







cases in search of guidance, since experience under the Guidelines







will develop slowly. And in any case, judicial descriptions of







compliance programs will of necessity focus on companies that in some







sense failed to prevent the offense in question.<p>















The Guidelines also create an unusual mixture of civil and criminal







legal concepts.  The standard of guilt for criminal acts is precise







and specific, but sentencing standards and the assessment of a







compliance program's adequacy takes the form of a "due diligence"







analysis, something akin to the amorphous civil law concept of







"reasonableness."  Thus, under the official Guidelines, adequate







compliance efforts are not precisely described in advance.<p> 















In 1994, the NCPL assembled a working group to address this problem.







The group is comprised of legal and compliance professionals from







corporations, law firms, consulting firms and universities. Its goal







is to create a set of "standards" that can be applied by







organizations of all types and sizes.  The NCPL Working Group is







cognizant of the widely-differing needs, circumstances and







capabilities of organizations, and alert to the message that a set of







"standards" might communicate to enforcement agencies and the







judiciary. The Group's purpose is therefore to create not minimum







requirements, but concrete interpretations and suggestions for the







design and operation of compliance programs.<p>















While the official Guidelines are directed at avoiding criminal







liability, the NCPL Working Group intends its standards to be of







benefit for both the prevention of criminal liability and for the







prevention of civil law consequences.  This is for two reasons. 







First, the overwhelming majority of legal problems experienced by







organizations occur in the civil law context. Second, it is a goal of







the U.S. Sentencing Commission, in promulgating its Guidelines, to







encourage the actions of organizations to prevent wrongdoing, not







merely to measure their sentences.<p>















<H3>Goals of the Seminar</h3>















The NCPL Working Group has two objectives in offering this seminar.







One is to make available to involved persons the results of the







substantial work it has done thus far.  The second objective is to







gather from seminar participants additional concrete examples and







illustrations of steps the business and legal communities have taken







in designing and operating systems for corporate compliance. 







Participants are therefore invited to contribute two things --







critique and implementation examples.  The end product -- a published







set of standards that are relevant and meaningful to corporate







clients -- will be in the form of detailed and concrete suggestions







to create practical corporate compliance programs.<p>















The Working Group's product, as it now stands, is a set of <EM>Twenty







Principles</em> with accompanying <EM>"Considerations."</em> The 







Considerations articulate in detail the Principles.  The Working Group 







is now collecting implementation examples, which will further articulate each







Consideration.<p>















This is how seminar participants can contribute to the project.  Each







day of this seminar one or more of the Principles and their







Considerations will be posted.  A commentary will also be appended







explaining the aspect of the Guidelines which the Principles and







Considerations address. We would appreciate your review,







consideration and response to any of the Principles or







Considerations.<p>  















You can also participate by sharing your company's own implementation







examples. 







Examples contributed should be as concrete and practical as possible,







providing real-life compliance program features. (Drafting







suggestions and a model example will follows this introduction.)<p>















In addition to the model and list of NCPL Principles posted below, we







also set out today an <EM>excerpt from the United States Sentencing 







Commission's Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations</em>. This







excerpt  sets out the factors to consider and the due diligence steps







relating to an "effective compliance program." <p>















Members of the NCPL will be online to react to questions and







comments. A short biographical sketch of each moderator is posted







separately.<p>

LAW</a></h2><p>







<H3>WORKING GROUP DRAFT<br>







TWENTY PRINCIPLES OF CORPORATE COMPLIANCE (DRAFT)</h3><p>







 







<H2>Establishing Compliance Programs</h2><p>















1.  Organizations should pursue compliance through the creation and







maintenance of an effective compliance program.<p>















2.  An effective compliance program is designed to prevent, detect







and respond to legal risks and to promote compliance with the law.<p>















3.  An effective compliance program is a dynamic process that is







designed to be flexible and modified, when appropriate, to reflect







changing conditions.<p>















4.  An effective compliance program states that it is the

<H2>Structure and Control</h2>















8.  Specific high-level personnel in an organization are responsible







for the administration and oversight of the compliance program.<p>















9.  A compliance program has the support of senior management of the







organization.  Each officer, manager and employee is responsible for







supporting and complying with the compliance program's standards and







procedures.<p>















10.  The organization exercises due diligence to determine whether







persons to whom substantial discretionary authority is delegated have







a propensity to engage in illegal activities and to prevent such







delegation to those persons.<p>















11.  The organization takes reasonable steps to achieve compliance







with its standards and the law.<p>























<H2>Response to Violations and Incidents</h2>















12. An effective compliance program is proactive in its approach to







dealing with incidents of noncompliance.<p>















13. An effective compliance program possesses or has access to







investigatory, valuative and reporting resources.<p>















14.  An effective compliance program addresses the occasions for







external reporting of violations of the law.<p>















15.  An effective compliance program utilizes incidents of







noncompliance to evaluate its own effectiveness, to correct







deficiencies and to effect improvements.<p>























<H2>Training Programs -- Making the System Effective</h2>















16.  The organization's compliance program has a communications







component, the objectives of which are to make employees and other







agents aware of applicable standards of conduct and to promote







compliance.<p>















17.  An effective communications program is designed to reach the







intended audience.<p>















18.  An effective compliance program communicates appropriate







information to the organization's employees and other agents.<p>















19.  All levels of management are responsible for the operation of







the organization's communications program concerning compliance.<p>















20.  Incentives and disincentives are significant tools in promoting







compliance.<p>

Subject: Copyright<p>















To all seminar participants --<p>















On behalf of the National Center for Preventive Law I want to







welcome you and thank you for your participation in this







compliance seminar.  We have been asked whether it would be







possible, given the special copyright conditions described above,







for participants to copy the NCPL Principles of Compliance and







their associated Considerations.  To make the seminar as useful to







you as possible, we would like to permit that, though the nature







of the work makes some limits and caveats necessary.<p>















Any participant in the seminar who wishes to print out any of







NCPL's drafts for his or her own use, or for the sole use of the







organization (company) by which he or she is employed, may do so.







We do, however, ask that printing and copying not occur otherwise.<p>















We should also underscore the fact that the drafts offered during







this seminar are just that -- drafts.  They have not yet received







the full endorsement of the Working Group or of the Trustees of







the National Center.  And of course they have not been validated







by any court or agency as per se satisfying the standards for







compliance programs under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.<p>















Those things said, we hope you find these proceedings as







helpful and as interesting as we will.  Your participation







is what will make it so.  Thanks again.<p>

<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3><p>



<H3>Section 8A1.2 (k)</h3><p>





An "effective program to prevent and detect violations of law" means

a program that has been reasonably designed, implemented, and







enforced so that it generally will be effective in preventing and







detecting criminal conduct.  Failure to prevent or detect the instant







offense, by itself, does not mean that the program was not effective.







The hallmark of an effective program to prevent and detect violations







of law is that the organization exercised due diligence in seeking to







prevent and detect criminal conduct by its employees and other







agents. Due diligence requires at a minimum that the organization







must have taken the following types of steps:<p>















(1) The organization must have established compliance standards and







procedures to be followed by its employees and other agents that are







reasonably capable of reducing the prospect of criminal conduct.<p>















(2) Specific individual(s) within high-level personnel of the







organization must have been assigned overall responsibility to







oversee compliance with such standards and procedures.<p>















(3) The organization must have used due care not to delegate







substantial discretionary authority to individuals whom the







organization knew, or should have known through the exercise of due







diligence, had a propensity to engage in illegal activities.<p>















(4) The organization must have taken steps to communicate effectively







its standards and procedures to all employees and other agents, e.g.,







by requiring participation in training programs or by disseminating







publications that explain in a practical manner what is required.<p>















(5)The organization must have taken reasonable steps to achieve







compliance with its standards, e.g., by utilizing monitoring and







auditing systems reasonably designed to detect criminal conduct by







its employees and other agents and by having in place and publicizing







a reporting system whereby employees and other agents could report







criminal conduct by others within the organization without fear of







retribution.<p>















(6) The standards must have been consistently enforced through







appropriate disciplinary mechanisms, including, as appropriate,







discipline of individuals responsible for the failure to detect an







offense.  Adequate discipline of individuals responsible for an







offense is a necessary component of enforcement; however, the form of







discipline that will be appropriate will be case specific.<p>















(7) After an offense has been detected, the organization must have







taken all reasonable steps to respond appropriately to the offense







and to prevent further similar offenses -- including any necessary







modifications to its program to prevent and detect violations of law.<p>















The precise actions necessary for an effective program to prevent and







detect violations of law will depend upon a number of factors.  Among







the relevant factors are:<p>















(i) Size of the organization - - The requisite degree of formality of







a program will vary with the size of the organization:  the larger







the organization, the more formal the program typically should be.  A







larger organization generally should have established written







policies defining the standards and procedures to be followed by its







employees and other agents.<p>















(ii) Likelihood that certain offenses may occur because of the nature







of its business -- If because of the nature of an organization's







business there is a substantial risk that certain types of offenses







may occur, management must have taken steps to prevent and detect







those types of offenses.<p>















(iii) Prior history of the organization -- An organization's prior







history may indicate types of offenses that it should have taken







actions to prevent.  Recurrence of misconduct similar to that which







an organization has previously committed casts doubt on whether it







took all reasonable steps to prevent such misconduct.<p>















An organization's failure to incorporate and follow applicable







industry practice or the standards called for by any applicable







governmental regulation weighs against a finding of an effective





program to prevent and detect violations of law.

<H3>Drafting Company Implementation Examples</h3><p>











<A HREF="http://www.pacificrim.net/~ncpl/">NCPL</a> is following the 







format below for examples it is including in







its final publication.  While those commenting are encouraged to use







this format, examples in any format are welcome.  The main objective







is to create the maximum response.  NCPL reserves the right to alter







examples submitted to achieve the desired format.<p>















<H4>These materials may not be reproduced without the permission of the



NCPL.</h4><p>















DRAFTING FORMAT SUGGESTIONS (AN ACTUAL MODEL FOLLOWS):<p> 







1.  Each example should be 3-4 sentences in length;<p> 















2.  The first sentence in each should identify the design decision or







factor within the prior consideration that the example relates to;<p> 















3.  The second sentence in each should explain what approach to that







design decision or factor the example will illustrate;<p> 















4.  The third and fourth sentence should describe a specific







compliance system design choice or implementation that illustrates







one resolution of the issue that is the overall subject of the







example.<p> 















<H3>Model Implementation Example for Principle 9, Consideration (a)</h3>















<H4>Principle #9<p>







An effective compliance program has the support of the senior







management of the organization. Each officer, manager and employee is







responsible for supporting and complying with the compliance







program's standards and procedures.</h4><p> 















Factors to Consider:<p> 















<H4>Consideration (a)<p>







Having participation in and support for the program throughout







the organization and not limited to the compliance officer.</h4>















<H3>Example 1</h3>







<H4>Participation throughout an organization means attention







to compliance in operational practices at every management level.  In







the midst of other performance pressures that are typical of middle







management environments, corporate managers at low levels in







corporate hierarchies may only address compliance concerns and







translate them into operational directions to their superiors if







those managers know that these activities will be monitored by higher







management. Thus, to encourage company-wide compliance, one large







corporation conducts audits of management performance in which each







manager is specifically asked to produce his or her copy of basic







company policies and to explain how the manager informs employees of







the policies.</h4>







My company is in the initial stages of formalizing a compliance







program.  (There was a lot there, but it was ad hoc.)  Some of the







commentary recommends using a "private inspector general", but it







seems like you would have to hand over a lot of confidential







information about your business practices to an outsider whom you







cannot ultimately control.  Has anyone actually used one?<p>















Also, does anyone know of an industry standards groups for







software and related services vendors?<p>

As counsel to a software vendor, I don't know of any "industry

compliance with respect to FDA software "regulation," however.<p>

Chris - I have never used a private inspector general (they use



the designation "IPSIG").  However, I can give you the name of



one of the founders of the IPSIG movement.  He is Ron Goldstock,

A late reply to your posting regarding the IPSIG issue:  I have a

copy of the "Report of the Civil Prosecution Committee of the New

York State Bar Association, Commercial and Federal Litigation

Section" on the issue of the Independent Private Sector Inspector

General.  If you (or anybody else) does not have a copy and would

like one, send me an E-mail and I'll get a copy to you.<p>

<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3><p>





From: Bernard Wolfman -- Harvard Law School - Cambridge<br>



Date:  Tue Oct 24 08:50<br>



Subject:  TCMP IRS Audits<p>



Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program (TCMP) audits fingered



particular taxpayers for a special type of audit, one that



required the [taxpayer] to document every single item on its return.

Most observers concluded that these audits provided the Government

with extraordinarily useful statistical data on compliance.

Although not used for the past several years, the IRS had planned



to resume TCMP audits on December 1, covering 150,000 taxpayers

for the year 1994.  But yesterday the IRS announced it was



"indefinitely postponing" the program resumption in order to save



the $1.5 billion it would cost, this in light of Congressional

budget cutting.  Most people in the know, although not all,



believe that by killing TCMP audits the Government's ultimate loss



in compliance, particularly corporate compliance, will cost it



far more than the $1.5 billion it will save.<p>

Appended by: John Voorhees -- Isaacson Rosenbaum - Denver<br>



Date: Tue Oct 24 10:38:21 1995<br>





Subject: TCMP IRS Audits<p>



I am  not in a position to know whether the TCMP audit program



should or should not be either eliminated or even postponed. I am

interested in the type of information contained in tax returns



that could be used by the government  against a corporate taxpayer 

to demonstrate non-compliance in regulatory proceedings.  For



example, can the government use information collected from a tax



return to obtain proof of an environmental violation. I thought



there was a prohibition against that type of activity. What should



companies do in creating compliance programs that insure the

filing of accurate tax returns?<p>



<hr><p>

Appended by: Bernard Wolfman -- Harvard Law School - Cambridge<br>





Date: Tue Oct 24 16:04:05 1995<br>



Subject: Tax Return Information<p>





It is generally prohibited for tax return information to be





divulged by IRS personnel to other branches of Government for any





purpose.  There is a narrow exception band, and it requires





approval at the highest level, rarely applicable.<p>

Among other things, a corporation's employee incentives, for those





in the tax department, must not be gauged on how little tax is





declared but on how accurate the return ends up.  Many of the





largest corporations, year after year, pay additional tax on





audit, just waiting to see if the revenue agent picks up the





dubious item.  The interest paid, along with the tax principal





when the agent finds an item, is usually less than the corporation





is able to earn on the principal, and so it pays to wait and see.





And it is also often an intra-corporate brownie point if a dubious





item claimed on a return escapes notice.  That culture would need

Subject: Access to Tax Returns<p>



You should be aware that there is a provision in the law which

allows the I.R.S. to make copies of returns available to U.S.

Customs under strict provisions in order that Customs may carry

out its audit functions and for the purposes of determining

whether or not violations of law have occurred.<p>

<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3><p>











From: Rick Bulman -- FL Counsel Connect - Miami<BR>







Date:  Mon Oct 23 17:10<BR>







Subject:  What is a Compliance Program?<P>







OK, I confess. I get this uncomfortable feeling with the term







"corporate compliance". In one way I feel it's sort of a new wave







psycho babble marketing pitch for lawyers trying to sell services







to corporations. (Like corporate "wellness" programs which are







simply ways to sell people on expanded insurance programs that







"save" money in the long run. "Uh right, I went broke while







getting well...".) I also get this overtone of "time-motion







studies" - standardized principles that enable all corporations to







do X with Y for Z. Except no company ever fits into X, Y or Z and







the solutions proposed are just more rules and regs that create







layer upon layer upon layer of paper from which to say, "Hey, what







are you, a dope? Try a little common sense." On the other hand it







would be nice to try and head off a few problems at the pass







without having to constantly justify oneself or to refer to a







guidebook the size of the Congressional record for a Mom & Pop







store. So, what really is this stuff? Who uses it? Why is it good?<p>

Subject: What's a Compliance Program?<p>







A fundamental question.  Thanks for asking it.<p>







It goes like this.  First, it is usually (but not always) the case







that preventing legal trouble (criminal violations and civil







liability) is more efficient, for the client, than is fixing legal







trouble after it arises.<p>







Second, it is correct that no two business organizations are







alike.  That becomes relevant to the legal-risk-prevention







business in a direct way, since the origin of legal risk usually







lies in the behavior of people.  If organizations are unlike, then







no one-size-fits-all way of addressing risk should be expected to







be very effective anywhere.<p>







Third, reinventing wheels is also inefficient.  If each of us







tried to create for each of our clients a legal risk prevention







(or minimization) program, tailored to each client's needs, we







could not do so at any acceptable cost to the client.<p>







Fourth, and here's the turning point, we believe that while the







gears and gizmos of prevention can't be one-size-fits-all, there







are common denominators -- i.e., principles that can be identified







as having positive effects in reducing legal risk.  The thrust of







the effort is therefore to identify those principles and to offer







them to others.  New applications thus have a place to start.<p>







There is nothing new in this.  It's just good management applied







to legal affairs.  And the idea of principles vs. practices isn't







new either.  For example, everyone knows that an auditor should be







independent of the person being audited.  That's at the level of







principle (though a pretty obvious one).  The elaborate structures







we see in corporations that are created to achieve that







desideratum are just specific applications of the general, and







replicable, principle.  We (at NCPL) believe there are a number of







useful, identifiable principles which can be articulated and







implemented in many particular ways, and which can lead to the







efficient reduction of legal risk.<p>







Years after this process began, the Federal Sentencing Commission







validated the notion by offering substantial mitigations in fines







otherwise assessed for corporate crimes, if the corporation







had put into place a system that was reasonably well designed to







serve as a legal-risk-preventive or compliance system.  The







problem with the FSG's guidelines is, that some people believe







they are too vague; and you won't find out if your efforts







qualify until after the fact.  If that is so, the trick is how to







create more useful and concrete ideas about workable







techniques for compliance -- i.e. legal risk reduction -- without







getting into the errors of the one-size-fits-all approach.<p>







That's why we're here.<p>

Subject: What is a Compliance Program?<p>







Good point.  Common sense goes a long way, usually a lot farther







than a fat compliance manual that only one person in a hundred has







read (and what kind of work is he doing??)<p>







It seems to me that all of the compliance programs, training







courses, manuals, memos, etc., are trying to accomplish two







things:<p>







No. 2: to convey information about legal requirements and what to







do to comply.<p>







No. 1: to get across the message (on a gut level, as part of the







organization's culture) that compliance is important, and that







each employee has the responsibility and authority to do something







about it.<p>







Number 1 is the more important, because that's what will make







people alert to use their common sense and the information they







get in training.  And even though this seems simplistic and







obvious, the message seems to get lost.  (Let's face it, "common"







sense often isn't, and if compliance were that easy, everybody







except the deliberate violators would have no trouble with







compliance.)  One training meeting a year doesn't demonstrate to







employees that this is a priority among the thousand other things







they have to do.<p>







It takes repetition and attention to keep sending the message that







compliance matters, but in running the programs, there is a danger







of burying people in more information than they need (message # 2)







and losing sight of the fact that the real point is simple: keep







paying attention.<p>

Subject: What is a Compliance Program?<p>







The points being made about teaching ethical intuition ("gut level







instincts") is important.  As part of the compliance program that







my company is drafting, we are thinking about including (and thus







legitimizing) a "smell test" that I have shamelessly plagiarized







from Texas Instruments, then renamed.  The formal elements are







listed below, but the concept is intended to guide employees when







the written materials don't cover the problem or cover it







ambiguously and they can't get immediate help.  (E.g. competitor's







salesman says to our salesman at a bar, "We're thinking of revising







our price for Competitor's Product.  What are you guys charging







for Your Product?")  The point of each of the elements is







indicated parenthetically.<p>







1)      Is it legal?  (Refer to the law.  Often they won't know, but







will have a decent idea that it isn't.)<p>







2)      Does it comply with our values?  (Refer to our mission







statement, etc.)<p>







3)      Is it wrong?  (Refer to employee's articulable values.)<p>







4)      If you do it, will you feel bad?  (Refer to employee's







unarticulated values.)<p>







5)      How would it look in the newspaper?  (Refer to society's







values.)<p>







6)      If you're not sure, what did the people you asked say?  (Make







them seek advice.)<p>







Any comments or additions?<p>

Date: Tue Oct 24 16:24:35 1995<br>







Subject: What is a Compliance Program?<p>







As I read these comments, two things strike me.<p>







First, mediating between "common sense" and a telephone book-sized



compliance manual that few (if anyone) will read before-the-fact



(obviously reading it after-the-fact rather defeats the purpose,



like shutting the barn door after the horse has bolted) suggests



the need for some kind of training program for each and every



employee whose job description is such that his acts or omissions



may result in substantial noncompliance.   (In other words, it



probably will not be necessary to require compliance training for



mailroom clerks, messengers, or other employees whose



responsibilities give rise to no reasonable risk of



noncompliance).  Whether such a training program is done in-house



by a full-time compliance officer, is outsourced to consultants,



uses fancy video or software programs or other bells and whistles,



is designed for repeat or refresher courses on an annual or other



periodic basis, etc. are all things that are likely to be highly



individualized decisions for each company.<p>







Second, there are undoubtedly different levels of compliance



programs and compliance training that are appropriate for



different industries, depending upon the type of regulation to



which that industry is subject.  For years I have represented



clients in the financial services industries (commercial banks,



investment banks, savings institutions, their holding companies,



etc.), which are highly regulated.  Banks in particular are



inundated with compliance issues and a particularly high



regulatory burden, and the risks of noncompliance are not limited



to possible sentencing consequences in the (relatively rare) event



of criminal misconduct but include a panoply of  civil enforcement



powers that federal regulators have in their arsenal.  



Noncompliance with certain types of regulatory requirements may



produce lesser consequences than noncompliance with others.  In



banking, for example, noncompliance with the Community



Reinvestment Act often will not lead to any particularly harsh



regulatory sanction; in contrast, as the past three years have



shown, any kind of lending discrimination (even unintentional) can



have very serious consequences indeed.  I suspect that, as



virtually all industries are regulated at some level (i.e., by



federal, state, or local agencies or some combination thereof), it



should be possible to design certain basic compliance programs



that are not merely firm-specific but have industrywide



application.  The question then becomes how many people within



each organization need to be familiar with that level of detail,



and what kinds of simplified guidelines can be prepared to give



the requisite collection of mental "red flags" to the rest of the



employees?<p>

Subject: What is a Compliance Program?<p>







Responding to Chris Lemens' six questions:  Each of these



questions tests the effectiveness of the compliance efforts of the



company. If the employee stops and seeks advice from the right



source the program works. NCPL's principles and considerations are



designed to  assist  the creation of a program that when



implemented operates effectively.  I read these questions as



reminders for employees who need to familiarize themselves with



the compliance program generally and then learn how to gauge their



actions accordingly. If the employee when confronted with  an



ethical  dilemma or compliance problem  stops and asks himself or



herself  one or more of these questions the program is working.

<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3><p>











From: Daniel Bishop -- Western Atlas, Inc. - Beverly Hills<br>











Date:  Mon Oct 23 12:50<br>











Subject:  Training<p>











As the Director of  Compliance for my corporation I have found the











creation and initial implementation of a Compliance Program to be











relatively easy. What has turned out to be difficult has been











keeping awareness of the Program at a sufficiently high level. I











had hoped to accomplish this through  various training courses but











the logistics of providing them in a consistent and meaningful way











at  worldwide locations has proved difficult. What would be most











helpful would be an interactive training program that can be used











by the individual users on their own PCs. A program of this nature











exists in the DOD contractor environment, however the











non-recurring charge plus the need for specialized equipment plus











the fact that a large portion of the training material is unique











to government contractors make it unattractive for the commercial











corporation. Does anyone know of any interactive training











materials relating to business ethics? For those of you with











children, we need the adult equivalent of  "Where in the World is











Carmen SanDiego?"<p>

Two pieces of information should soon be coming your way.  I have











asked our research department (Department?  It's two people, named











Greg and Michele) to do some bibliographic research for you in our











own resources.  We will share what we find.  By the way, we hope











to make some of this kind of service available throughout the











seminar.  Second, on another wavelength I learned that Kirk Jordan

Dan --<p>











As Ed mentioned, at Compliance Systems Legal Group we recently











developed a PC based interactive video program for legal











compliance and business ethics training.  We custom developed the











program for a manufacturing company with about 10,000 employees at











dispersed locations.  The program is designed to introduce all of











the company's employees and agents to the company's formal











compliance program, by describing the major components of the











program (i.e., who is the compliance officer, how the company's











"hotline" works),  and by placing employees, through the use of











video scenarios, in "on the job" compliance situations.  In order











to navigate successfully through the scenarios, employees are











required to make the right choices.  If  an employee chooses the











wrong answer,   a reteaching segment  or consequentiality video











follows. The company is reporting great success in implementing











the program.<p>











The entire course is interactive, requiring employee participation











and response throughout.  Like many of the programs developed by











the Defense Industry Initiative companies, our program features











video as the dominant multimedia medium.  In our experience,











employees greatly prefer video over traditional text based CBT.











Because these interactive training programs run on computers,











comprehensive and flexible training records can be easily











generated.<p>











As I mentioned, this program was custom developed.  I am not aware











of any generic interactive training programs for business ethics











and legal compliance (although we have been kicking around the











idea of developing some generic modules, that could be











"customized").  There are, of course, some generic interactive











"compliance" training modules in discrete substantive areas -- for











example, OSHA and sexual harassment.  But I question whether the











government would consider "effective" a training program that











utilized only generic training modules -- particularly for a large











company.<p>











If you (or anybody else) would like more information on the











program, feel free to post another comment, call me ((401)











738-3666), or <A HREF="mailto:kjorda00@counsel.com">e-mail me (kjorda00@counsel.com)</a>.<p>











Also, stay tuned to the corporate compliance seminar: in the











coming days we will discuss many compliance training and











communications issues (see particularly principles/considerations











16-20), and perhaps we'll hear from others on what they have found











to be effective means of communicating compliance standards in











their organizations.<p>

Subject: Reference materials<p>











I've had some success in creating computerized materials for legal





compliance in relatively narrow areas, particularly trade





regulation, and securities regulations. When properly set up,





these have the effect of a training program, even though they





don't attempt to emulate a classroom program.<p>











In one trade regulation system, the delivery vehicle on its





surface was a document assembly/quasi expert system used to





prepare work product. The user interface, however, was structured





to teach the underlying regulatory scheme and was supported by a





"help" system which provided explanations and a research system





which organized and presented the case law illustrating the





particular point. The system is being used in a large law





department and is accessible to non-lawyers as well in a variation





which does not permit the production of legal work product.<p>











When new hires or transfers are first exposed to the area, they





are trained to use the system by being given hypothetical cases





which they work through the process. If the user attempts to





do something which is not permitted by the regulations, the





system will identify the anomaly and, in many cases, propose





an alternative strategy. Each of the steps is presented to them





and a supervisor goes over the work product. The result is that





the compliance program is built into the process for creating the





work product.<p>











The missing element from such a system is *indoctrination*, a key





part of any compliance system. When I put the substantive law





materials together for the system, I focused on underlying





rationales for the regulatory scheme. When I interviewed senior





lawyers responsible for managing the compliance program, however,





I discovered conflicting attitudes toward compliance overall.





Instead of indoctrinating their staff with the underlying concerns





of the regulatory scheme, their approach was "teach them how to





dodge the bullets and get through."<p>











Overall, the system has been successful, but I would





rather have inculcated a set of compliance values. I believe that





the result would be less dissonance when the system explained the





inappropriateness of a particular tactic, and thus a higher level





of compliance and less wasted time.<p>

Subject: On-Line Training<p>











Does using the company's network count as interactive training?





While I was at Equitable Life, I formulated the company's first





insider trading compliance and education program.  The company had





just gone public (in 1992), so we had the opportunity to start





from scratch, but with considerable learning from others.  I was





struck by the typical approach of paper-based communication with





employees to announce and disseminate policies.  I used this





because it was the norm.<p>











But then I added another feature:  I used the company's network





(that housed the e-mail and internal communications system) and





created a bulletin board (like the Discuss menu at Counsel





Connect) called "Equitable stock information."  I provided





information on that bulletin board of interest to employees:





daily stock price, commission free purchase program details,





dividend reinvestment plan data.  But you had to scroll through a





"warning notice" first, that stated that there are special rules





that apply to purchases and sales of the company's stock.  The





next statement referred to the insider trading policy, and then





stated that if you hit a keyboard key, you could immediately





access the policy statement.<p>











This provided immediately available information on the policy,





avoided excuses about the thick manual or loss of paper (which





most employees, don't read anyway) and became very popular,





because the lure was in providing information to employees that





was useful and relevant to them.<p>











We found that employees read this bulletin board more than any





other -- even the job posting board.<p>

Concerning interactive training for compliance programs, there are

a number of nationwide organizations like ours that provide these

services. However, at a recent seminar entitled "Corporate Crime

in America - Strengthening the 'Good Citizen' Corporation,"

sponsored by the United States Sentencing Commission, I was

impressed by the research conducted by The Council of Ethical

Organizations. In assessing training programs that were effective

vs. ineffective, or harmful, the study concluded that "training

programs delivered primarily by means of video and interactive

technology and in game format were ineffective or harmful. However,

training programs that were 'interactive' over one contact hour in

length, and periodically repeated  were effective." Please see our

upcoming article in the December issue of the <I>Preventive Law

Reporter</i> entitled <STRONG>GAMES TRAINERS PLAY</strong> in which we discuss,

among other things, how to make compliance training interesting,

meaningful, and very practical.<p>

To Tom McQueen,<p>





Corporate Conduct Quarterly, of Rutgers University,  published


the results of the Council's study in Vol. 3, issue 4, along with


a piece by me raising questions about the study.  While I agree


that some training techniques are better than others, and that


games, video, etc, should not be used on a stand-alone basis, I


have some skepticism about the broadness of  Mark Pastin's


conclusions.  For example, it would take some powerful study


techniques to convince me that computer-based training actually


<STRONG>increases</strong> the likelihood of violations.  I think Pastin does not


take into account the effectiveness of such techniques in helping


employees to retain important information on such technical areas


as government contract compliance.   We need more research on what


really works in the compliance area, but we should be very careful


about drawing conclusions from such early studies.<p>





Anyone interested in seeing the CCQ pieces or finding out more


about the Quarterly should call 609 225-6311.<p>

From: Christina Cooley -- Counsel Connect - Atlanta<br>





Date:  Mon Oct 23 21:48<br>





Subject:  PR. 1-Establishing a Program<p>







This is how seminar participants can contribute to the





project.  Each day of this seminar one or more of the







Principles and their Considerations will be posted.  A







commentary will also be appended explaining the aspect of















the Guidelines which the Principles and Considerations











address.  We would appreciate your review, consideration











and response to any of the Principles and Considerations.<p>



You can also participate by sharing your company's own







implementation examples.  Examples contributed should be



as concrete and practical as possible, providing real-life

<H4>NATIONAL CENTER FOR PREVENTIVE LAW WORKING GROUP DRAFT</h4>







<H3>Establishing Compliance Programs</h3>











<I>Note: Principle 1 and its Considerations are intended to







address the following aspect of the <a href=../../../../download/seminars/fsg1.html>











Federal Sentencing Guidelines:  Sec. 8A1.2(k)(1)</a>:  "The Organization must have











established compliance standards and procedures to be followed







by its employees and other agents that are reasonably capable



of reducing the prospect of criminal conduct."</i><p>







<H4>Principle 1.  Organizations should pursue compliance through



the creation and maintenance of an effective compliance







program.</h4>







Factors to Consider:<p>



(a) Creating a program that is built on pre-existing



organizational values and practices, so that the program reflects,







incorporates and is integrated with an organization's culture,







ethos and corporate objectives.<p>







(b) Designing a program that is tailored in formality and scope







to the size, form and history of an organization.<p>



(c) Identifying the types of legal requirements most commonly







affecting an organization and its operations.<p>







(d) Reviewing the need for special compliance components based on







an organization's history of violations (if any), the legal risks







inherent in the operations of the organization, industry standards







and regulatory regimes, federal sentencing commission standards



and other governmental standards describing desirable components







of compliance systems.<p>



(e) Directing organization members toward compliance through



compliance codes, operating standards, codes of ethics, and other











corporate policy and philosophy statements.<p>







(f) Setting forth program definitions and operating practices in







writing and disseminating program descriptions through manuals and







other appropriate media.<p>







(g) Memorializing specific steps taken in the implementation and







operation of a compliance program so as to create a record of



organizational attention to compliance.<p>







(h) Including systematic record making and document retention







practices in organizational operations that will aid in monitoring







organizational compliance and in demonstrating the completion of







compliance procedures.<p>







We urge you to submit comments and examples about the above



Principle.  To assist you in this, please review the postings



from the first day of the seminar, October 23, on the <a href=../../../../download/seminars/fsg1.html>Federal

Subject: PR. 1-Establishing a Program<p>



Let me start things off by offering an example of Consideration







(d) to Principle 1:<p>







The food equipment industry has a standard-setting body and







"listing"  agents which address, among other things, the food







adulteration concerns of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act.







The standards set by the National Sanitation Foundation have







aspects which are intended to prevent food equipment materials,



components and designs from containing toxic materials as







identified by FDA regulations.  A manufacturer which elects to







have its products "listed" to such standards by organizations like







the National Sanitation Foundation or Underwriters Laboratories







accomplishes two worthwhile outcomes under Considerations 1(d).



First, it manufactures product to an industry standard which has



had careful development with the involvement of the regulatory



authorities.  Second, it agrees in its listing agreement to (i)



submit to the listing agency its specifications and to maintain







the same throughout the manufacturing process, and (ii) subject







itself to periodic compliance audits by the listing agent, which







is an independent, external organization of the type that FDA



enforcement officials have recommended be a part of company



compliance measures.<p>

Subject: Communication<p>







It is important that knowledge of laws applicable to the







particular industry be fully communicated and accepted within the



organization.  For example, one of our subsidiaries manufactures



food equipment to be sold to the consumer market.  The Consumer











Product Safety Act applies to the product line.  The requirements







of the law were reviewed in detail with the key managers of the



subsidiary.  Procedures are now being implemented to assure that



the company continues to be in compliance.<p>

Subject: PR. 1-Establishing a Program<p>







Your NCPL principles are obviously well thought out and well



crafted; however, I would pose a basic question going to the premise



of the project, namely does it  substantially add anything to the







template for a Compliance Program provided by the [FSG]. It would







seem that a careful reading and understanding of the [FSG] followed



by the crafting of a program to meet, in some form, each of the



identified criteria would result in a satisfactory program. Since



the director of the company's program is to be a senior company



official it would seem as though this individual would be well



placed to develop a program that is best suited for that



particular company. In short, I am not sure the creation of a



program is all that difficult; it is the day to day running  of











the program that is hard.<p>

Subject: PR. 1-Establishing a Program<p>







Dan: speaking for myself as a member of the NCPL Commission that



has been drafting the principles of corporate compliance and not



for the full Commission let me address your comment as follows.



For the last several years since the [Federal Sentencing Guidelines] were promulgated



there has been a compelling need for businesses to create



compliance programs  not only to avoid stiff penalties for



criminal violations but also to prevent  criminal violations from



occurring as well as to minimize civil liability. Many of us have



done what you have suggested and studied the [FSGs] criteria and



used other materials for guidance in creating programs for clients



and for our own companies.   NCPL found that there were persons



quite knowledgeable in this area who could pool their collective



experience and develop common principles and considerations that



could be useful to all companies of whatever size  who were



interested in achieving compliance in a hostile regulatory



environment.   Many companies even with excellent compliance



programs have encountered  problems in implementing their



programs. For  these reasons and more  it was decided to attempt



to draft principles  and considerations that would be helpful to



all companies  who wanted to make a real commitment to achieving



compliance. The [FSGs] only specify the "types of steps" a company



must take "at a minimum" to create an effective compliance



program. The [FSGs] alone do not provide a complete answer how to



achieve compliance nor do they adequately address serious issues



of avoidance of civil liability. The principles and considerations



drafted by the Commission are not intended to set minimum



standards in this regard but they are intended to  provide as much



common experience as possible to aid the development of effective



compliance programs at  minimal cost.<p>

Dan, I generally agree with your perspective, but the Devil is in

the Details, as they say, and there is not enough detail in the

FSG's to give the newcomer or the unwary enough perspective to

develop a program and run it in the first pass.  Witness the

complexities of the Draft Environmental Guidelines that the USSC

has been considering.<p>



I could type on and on but I will spare you.  Your perspective

was one consideration in the article I authored about 

<A HREF="http://www.courttv.com/legalhelp/business/seminar/634.html">nuclear

weapons systems and compliance programs</a>.  It's in the Library for

this seminar.  I would recommend you look it over.  It relates in

large part to the points you have raised in your note.

Subject: Need for Compliance Programs<p>



The need for corporate compliance programs is coming from a number

of federal agencies which regulate the way businesses operate. For

example, in the environmental area the use of compliance programs

has exploded over the last three to four years.<p>



In the export licensing area, the existence of corporate

compliance programs is mandatory in order to avoid criminal

problems. The use of corporate compliance programs is now being

urged by U.S. Customs as part of its new philosophy known as the

Mod Act, the second part of the NAFTA legislation. Although no

detailed regulations have yet been published, there are provisions

in the law which lower or eliminate civil penalties  if the

company has in place a compliance program which the agency

approves. Criminal penalties can be avoided or lessened on the

same basis.<p>



This discussion group has brought up compliance programs regarding

the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and FDA issues. The ABA recently

advertised a program in the environmental area. I was a speaker at

a program a couple of weeks ago in Chicago where four speakers

dealt with issues all from the perspective of how compliance

programs avoid problems: anti-trust, Foreign Corrupt Practices

Act, export licensing and trade.<p>



It seems to me the question is not whether or not  compliance

programs are a good idea. Rather the issue is if companies do not

implement them, they will be at a serious disadvantage when the

agencies which audit or otherwise influence how they do business

"visit" them.<p>

Subject:  Pitfalls (or why not to...)<p>



Here is the problem I see with Corporate Compliance programs.



Inevitably, someone within the company will engage in some



misconduct, which, hopefully, the company will detect.  If so, the



compliance program must determine whether or not to report the

criminal misconduct engaged in on behalf of the company.  If the

company chooses not to report, the compliance program will be



deemed ineffective at best and obstructionist at worst.  If a



report is made to law enforcement, the company becomes a first



time offender -- decreasing the sanction for the first offense,

but dramatically increasing the sanctions for any subsequent

offense.  All told, it is better to evaluate on a case by case

basis whether or not to voluntarily disclose misconduct, rather



than to have a knee-jerk "policy" on this...<p>

Subject: Incentives (or why to ..)<p>



You make a valid point Mark:  Under the Organizational Sentencing

Guidelines, a company will not receive credit for its compliance



program if, after becoming aware of a criminal offense, the

company unreasonably delays reporting the offense to the

government.<p>



However, if the company's compliance program is functioning



effectively, there's a good chance that the company will discover



the misconduct earlier rather than later.  I would take the issue



you raised and consider it this way:  Is it better for the company



to discover incipient misconduct, investigate it, impose







discipline, make appropriate modifications to its compliance







program, and then (if it so chooses) go to the government,  or







first hear of the illegal activity when the government comes







knocking at the door?  In the former posture, the company is in a



much better position to argue that the government should pursue

the responsible individuals only, and not the company.<p>

My point is this -- an effective compliance program will often put



the company in the driver's seat with respect to internal



misconduct.  After catching a violation in the early stages, and

with appropriate time for investigation and reflection, the

company may decide reporting is the way to go. On the other hand,

assuming there is no independent duty to report, the company may

determine, after a violation, simply to take appropriate internal



action and bear the risk of a nondisclosure.<p>



Finally, there are existing programs -- such as the Antitrust



Amnesty Program -- that provide significant incentives to



organizations to be the first to disclose misconduct.   Under the



Antitrust program, the second to disclose can expect no benefit,



and is likely to be prosecuted.  An effective compliance program,



with robust auditing and monitoring mechanisms --  will help



ensure that your company is the first through the door.<p>



Stay tuned to the seminar -- principles 12-15 will dig into these



issues in more detail.<p>

Subject: Pitfalls(or why not to...)<p>

Mark - I endorse Kirk's reply, but would like to add a technical



point.  I do not think it is completely correct to say that one



gets "no credit" for a compliance program if one fails to



self-disclose.  The mitigation credit is lost, but compliance



programs still count in determining where within the sentencing



range you fall, once the formula of mitigating and aggravating



factors is used to determine what range applies.  That is, after

you find the culpability score, there is a minimum and a maximum







multiplier that applies.  Where you fall between the minimum and







maximum can be affected by the existence of a compliance







program.<p>

Secondly, existence of a program is taken into account in the



decision to impose probation.  If you have no program, one will



likely be imposed (and a God-awful one it will be!).  If you have



a program, even if you did not voluntarily self-disclose, you can







avoid a government-imposed program.<p>



Of course, there are other benefits from having a good program,



including the ability to convince a prosecutor not to prosecute,





and the ability to prevent many violations in the first place.<p>

Subject: Pitfalls<p>







We all are waiting to see how these things shake out in the real



world of government agents, prosecutors and judges.  However, I



think that the last remark of Mr. Murphy bears reflection.<p>







As a criminal defense lawyer, I do tend to see the bleaker



picture. If we are brought in post-indictment, the government



starts any discussion with mechanical applications of the



Sentencing Guidelines, whether for individuals or organizations,



and we embark on an uphill journey.  If we have the opportunity to



come in pre-indictment, our main focus is to avoid the filing of



the indictment or to limit its scope in terms of number and



seriousness of charges or who the defendants will be.<p>



Historically, government agencies become aware of and even



investigate far more cases than they take to the United States



Attorney's office for filing.  And [Assistant U.S. Attorney's]



do not file a good



number of the cases presented to them.  We have all had



considerable success in persuading the government no to indict



even if it means a civil consent decree or some other approach



which keeps the FSG's from being invoked.  In other words,



appealing to the discretion of the law enforcement agency and the



AUSA pre-indictment can make all of the difference in the world.<p>







What is antithetical to our way of thinking as Americans is to be



required to turn ourselves in in order to avoid more Draconian



punishment.  The Organizational Sentencing Guidelines fail to take



into account that the human beings who are required to do this



have been raised with the correct understanding that they, as



individuals, do not have to incriminate themselves.  And, while we



may understand the reasoning for voluntary organizational



disclosure, it is still intuitively repugnant.<p>







However, given the present state of prosecutorial affairs, a



company with a good compliance program, which catches illegal



activity early and deals with it has a chance to avoid indictment. 



That chance, historically (before the Organizational Sentencing



Guidelines), has been rather significant.  Therefore, there is a



good pragmatic reason (as we see things now) to favor disclosure.



Of course, as said above, each case has to be evaluated on its



facts.<p>







What we will have to find out is whether or not voluntary



disclosures will significantly increase the filings.  In other



words, will the agencies and the U.S. Attorney's office be more



likely to seek indictment.  It may seem easier for an agent to



persuade an AUSA to indict if the corporation has laid out all of



the evidence, there does not seem to be any resistance to



prosecution and evidence collection Fourth and Fifth Amendment



concerns have been obviated by the private organization doing law



enforcement's work.  Hopefully, the government will see the



benefit to early disclosure and reward it appropriately rather



than taking unfair advantage.<p>

Respectfully, I submit that the discussion may be too focused on

the prosecutorial end of the issue, and not enough on the

practical side.  What I mean is this.  Aside from the implicit

issues of self monitoring and reporting, is the preventative

aspects of the program.  Good training and communication enhances

the opportunity to create an awareness and understanding in the

organization that contributes significantly to a reduction of

ignorance -- which, in my opinion, is one of the major reasons why

people (and hence organizations) do things wrong in the first

place. <p>



Without a program (at least the type defined by the FSG's), there

is little chance that an organization will stop to take the time

(and devote the resources) to give employees and agents focused,

quality training and communications on what it is they need to

know to stay out of trouble, and hence keep the organization out

of trouble, too.<p>



Now, I don't believe for a moment that everyone will leave their

pew after the sermon and sin no more, but it has been my

experience that the greater majority do, and they then become

aware of missteps by others in their midst, enhancing both the

deterrent and detective value of the program.<p>

Mark Rasch: There are several problems with your "case-by-case"

approach. You say "inevitably" someone will engage in misconduct

that "hopefully" the company will detect. Compliance programs are

designed to prevent misconduct from occurring in the first

instance. A key component of any compliance program is training.

Stay tuned to the seminar because Principles 12-15 address how to

create and implement training programs that are helpful in

preventing violations. No compliance program that I have drafted

or that I have seen has a "knee-jerk" policy on reporting

violations. To the contrary, effective compliance programs have

built in mechanisms to detect circumstances that may be present

that make  misconduct possible. The idea is to avoid violations by

identifying liability-causing conduct and training management and

employees before the violation can occur. If a violation does

occur despite the best efforts of management and employees, an

organizational response is essential. Principles 16-20 address how

to respond to violations to minimize the company and employees'

exposure and maximize the ability of the company to prevent future

misconduct. Case-by-case evaluations are important  but they need

to be conducted subject to internal controls  and an

organizational structure, Principles 8-11. All of us who have

worked on compliance problems share your concern that disclosure

of violations can make matters worse for everyone. To solve this

problem, a company must have a program that is designed to be fair

to all employees and at the same time prevent and deter future

misconduct. A  case-by-case approach  without  internal controls

is prone to post hoc rationalizations that inevitably make matters

worse for everyone, particularly when the second offense occurs.<p>

Mr. Zinn is not in disagreement with the others in this thread.  I

think we all agree that corporate compliance programs which

promote awareness and understanding are intrinsically good.<p>



The issues addressed first by Mr. Rasch, and subject to comment

thereafter in the thread, are the pitfalls associated with (as

some have called it) the privatization of law enforcement,

voluntary disclosure, or self-policing.  These are cases where the

corporate compliance officers hand a potential criminal case over

to the government on a silver platter.  The FSG's provide for

mitigation of sentence if you voluntarily disclose possible

criminal behavior but there is no provision for immunity, nor can

there be in the FSG's since they are by nature post-conviction

remedies.  Historically in criminal investigations, the U.S.

Attorney will offer immunity to certain participants in a scheme.

It is roughly founded on the proposition that the first on board

gets the deal to testify against the others.  Mr. Jordan notes

that there is an Antitrust Amnesty program based on the same

concept but there is no policy covering most of what may be

voluntarily disclosed.  And there is no policy guiding the

government in these cases to simply prosecute no one in light of a

voluntary disclosure.<p>



In the real world today we still do not know how this

self-policing is going to work out.  And those of us who have seen

what happens to the lives of people who are indicted, even if they

are eventually acquitted, know how critical the filing decision

is.  As indicated here and in another thread, several

practitioners voice strong desires to see some kind of

codification establishing clear restrictions on prosecution where

corporations turn themselves and their employees in.<p>



In essence, if the self-policing aspect of the guidelines catches

on, the government will hear about all sorts of criminal behavior

which never would have come to its attention.  Even more

significantly, it will receive on a silver platter detailed

information, perhaps sufficient to present to an AUSA for

indictment, which it would have had to spend hundreds or thousands

of agent hours investigating.  In fact, in a nation of snitches,

law enforcement agents will have more than enough to do processing

"voluntary disclosures" without ever following up on their own

leads.<p>



The harsh reality is that when the U.S. Attorney's office really

files on a silver platter case, there is a good chance that there

will be substantial prison time for one or more individuals and

substantial fines for the organization.  This may not be too hard

to accept if there were one or two bad actors who deserve to be

punished in some greater sense, however, wait until you have one

of those strict liability offenses or some other situation where

good people are going to be felons.  For instance, a corporation's

staff person fails to make a full disclosure in a routine SEC

filing; the compliance officer is contacted and not only directs

that an amended filing be made immediately but that a further

voluntary disclosure be made to the enforcement division; the CEO,

CFO and the other top officers of the corporation have been

involved in fund raising during this period and the company

continues to sell securities through its brokers.  As a part of

the silver platter, the compliance officer turns over to the

government information it would have never found or asked for

laying out in detail who was responsible for what with a lot of

internal fingerpointing memos by which everyone is trying to cover

themselves while implicating others.<p>



The compliance program has worked.  It corrected an error.  It

also got information to the government regarding possible criminal

behavior before it was discovered by the government.  Everyone

should get a gold star, right?  Wrong!  The CEO, CFO and top executives

will all be indicted for securities fraud.  With any kind of

significant "intended loss," the CEO, CFO and top executives are

looking roughly at 51 to 63 months in the federal Bureau of

Prisons (explain that to their husbands, wives and children at the

next company picnic if there is one and you still let them come).

Not only that, but the company is indicted for a series of

felonies and faces disgorgement, fines and probation along with

civil penalties and debarment.  The company gets a break on the

criminal fines, but it may not matter.<p>



Even if we win the criminal trial for some or all of the

participants, everyone's life is changed forever.<p>



Now, this doesn't mean that I advocate corporate ignorance (quite

to the contrary) or that I advocate conspiracies to coverup crime.

However, I do think that "knee-jerk" disclosure, as first posted

for discussion by Mr. Rasch, should not replace careful evaluation

on a case by case basis.  I also think that "self-policing,"

"voluntary disclosure," "privatization of law enforcement," "Good

Citizen" corporations, "snitching on your fellow humans at work"

or whatever you want to call it is both dangerous and distasteful.<p>





There are a lot of other issues (which I think are coming up in

this seminar) but one serious issue is whether or not we will

restrain the government from indicting as a result of voluntary

disclosure, silver platter cases.  If so, how and to what extent?<p>

Subject: Incentives (or why to ..)<p>



Louis Brown wrote an editorial in the Winter 1994 Preventive Law

Reporter.  This editorial addresses some of the issues discussed

above and Louis suggested we reprint it within this thread.<p>



THOUGHTS ABOUT COMPLIANCE REVIEW UNDER THE FEDERAL SENTENCING

GUIDELINES<p>



Organizations operate under an extremely diverse set of rules,

regulations and laws.  Traditionally, the initial enforcement of

the criminal process is the sole responsibility of the executive

branch of government.  With the vast increase in the scope and

complexity of these rules, regulations and laws, the growth and

diversity of organizations and the general prevailing view for

reduction of taxes, it is virtually impossible for government to

police and enforce all these laws.<p>



We have reached the time when law enforcement is to become

partially privatized.  Privatization in this sense means that the

very organizations that must abide by the laws are the

organizations that must police the laws.  Self-policing has become

a course of conduct; that is, a socially needed function.  For

self-enforcing procedures to work and for organizations to pursue

them, they need as much encouragement as can be offered.<p>



What is needed is a reward theory to affirmatively encourage the

compliance review process.  This important idea was set forth in

Sigler and Murphy, Interactive Corporate Compliance: An

Alternative to Regulatory Compulsion (Quorum Books, 1988).<p>



The Federal Sentencing Guidelines include a provision for reducing

criminal sentences where the guilty organization has an

appropriate compliance review process.  Under the present

Guidelines, the compliance review process is effective only after

conviction.<p>



I can suggest three means by which this socially desirable

objective of self-policing under effective compliance review can

be furthered:<OL><p>



<LI>PERMIT EVIDENCE OF COMPLIANCE REVIEW IN THE CASE IN CHIEF.<br>

Evidence of a defendant organization's review process is

admissible under present procedures only after conviction.  Could

the compliance review process be taken into account earlier in the

criminal prosecution under the case in chief?  Should the jury (or

judge), in effect, be permitted to evaluate whether there should

have been a prosecution?<p>



<LI>ALLOW DUE DILIGENCE/ADVISE OF COUNSEL AS A DEFENSE.<br>

This is an established concept that should be considered.  It is

permitted as a defense in connection with a fraud penalty in

federal income tax and malicious prosecution cases.  Should it be

allowed as a defense in cases that come under the Sentencing

Guidelines.  Due Diligence/Advise of Counsel can be shown where a

corporation adheres to appropriate standards, such as those being

developed in the current NCPL project.<p>



<LI>DEVELOP PROSECUTORIAL GUIDELINES.<br>

A related approach might be to use compliance standards to assist

in establishing a set of U.S. prosecutorial guidelines.  As far as

I am aware, prosecution is a unilateral discretionary

determination by the prosecuting authority.  I do not know (does

anyone know?) what goes into this determination.  Would it be

socially desirable to establish principles, standards or rules so

that the decision to prosecute tends toward uniformity?  More

important than uniformity, compliance standards might be used to

encourage further self-policing.  Perhaps provisions might be made

for cooperative policing instead of prosecution.<p></ol>



I am confident that once appropriate compliance review standards

are established and further rewards are made available for

enacting effective processes, self-policing will increase and

enhanced compliance will result.<p>

Subject: Pitfalls(or why not to...)<p>



In reading these comments, I can't help but wonder why there is

not more vigorous criticism of the government for failing to offer

more concrete incentives to companies to voluntarily disclose

violations of law by their employees.  In promulgating the

organizational sentencing guidelines the government encourages

companies to self-police and disclose violations of law.  At the

same time, the government (except the Antitrust Division) reserves

the right to harshly punish the disclosing company to the extent

permitted by the Guidelines, leaving every lawyer in a quandary

about whether to recommend disclosure.  In other words, if you

don't self-police and disclose you will be punished and when you

do, you still may be punished. The government can't have it both

ways but so far, other than the Antitrust Division, its trying to.<p>



The bar and business community, in my opinion, have not been

sufficiently outspoken about the government's inconsistent

approach.<p>

Subject: Pitfalls(or why not to...)<p>



Greg - I agree with that criticism of the government.  In fact,

much of our legal system seems designed to discourage effective

compliance programs and voluntary self-disclosure.  Although

there are exceptions like the Sentencing Commission, government in

general is often timid about recognizing  and rewarding compliance

programs.<p>



In addition to the Antitrust Division's leniency policy, another

example of government giving a commitment to those who self-police

is the recent state legislation granting immunity for voluntary

disclosures of environmental violations (in the Texas legislation

this also includes workplace safety violations).  There is a

similar proposal pending before Congress.<p>



Before we heap too much praise on the Antitrust Division, though,

it should be noted that they are in  the Stone Age when it comes

to dealing with company compliance programs.  The Division's

spokespeople have said such programs are essentially irrelevant in

the prosecution decision, and with respect to issues of liability.<p>



On that point other agencies are far ahead of the Division.<p>

<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3><p>



From: Jeffrey Davis -- Moore & Van Allen - Charlotte<br>



Date:  Wed Oct 25 11:46<br>



Subject:  Insider Trading<p>

One of my partners has a client which is a rapidly growing company



that conducted an initial public offering within the last 12 months 



and whose stock is thinly traded on NASDAQ.  The executive officers 



of the Company would like to have as long a window as possible after 



making their quarterly and year-end announcements and filings within



which to trade their stock.  They would like their Company's insider 



trading policy to provide for a trading window which opens



when they make their quarterly or annual announcements and filings



and remains open until the end of the current quarter.  They understand 



that at all times they are subject to restrictions on



trading due to their possession of other material inside



information and they also understand the consequences on a Company's 



stock price if the executives of the Company sell stock.  The



Company has a number of divisions and the senior executives state



that until they gather information after the end of the quarter, 



that they do not know as a general matter how the



current quarter or year will look.  They acknowledge that they



might have knowledge in a particular quarter that earnings would be 



high or low due to an unique event or series of events



and would not trade with that knowledge.  My partner would like to



know:<p>







A.  How long a trading window have smaller, publicly held clients



in the technology or health care area adopted?<p>







B.  In all events do you advise your clients that the trading



window should close at the end of a quarter or calendar year 



or do you recommend that the window close within two weeks or more



prior to the end of a quarter or calendar year?<p>







C.  Are you aware of any resource materials specifically dealing



with or including proposed insider trading policies for companies



like this?<p>







D.  Sample insider trading policies would be appreciated.<p>







Thanks in advance for any help.<p>

Subject: No window at all<p>



A window open as widely as [you] describe is no window at all.<p>



On the "tweaking" side, the window should not open on release of

earnings, but anywhere from 24 to 72 [hours] after that time,

depending on your confidence level re: the distribution of your

earnings announcements (e.g. a widely traded stock followed by

several analysts tends to get almost immediate attention).<p>



On the larger side, a "window" that is open for something like 45

or more days (depending on when [you] release earnings) is the same as

simply relying on [executives] not to trade on inside information.  Maybe that's

adequate in a given company, but the "window" is not giving [you] any

greater protection.  Sure, [executives] may not "know" how the quarter

will come out, but they certainly have a good idea, and the purpose

of the window should be to take the [question] of when a "good idea"

becomes "knowledge" out of their hands, for everyone's benefit.<p>



An alternative, which we use here at a small thinly traded

technology [company], is to require all [executives] subject to insider trading

rules to clear trades [with me, the general counsel] first.  The number of

people involved is small, the [amount] of trading is small, and it works

fine.<p>



Another alternative, if appropriate, is to encourage the [executives] to

establish a regular program of selling not dependent on any

external event - [for example] "I want to sell 1000 shares on the last day of

every quarter, and I won't change that plan [without] at least [one quarter's]

notice to (an internal compliance person or the [corporate secretary])".<p>



On your specific [questions], I don't have specific [statistics], but my sense is

that a 20 or 30 day window is more common than the [approximately] 45 or 60

days [you] propose.  I think Prentice Hall's Sec. 16 Guide has sample

policies.

<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3><p>

From: Richard S. Gruner -- Whittier Law School<br>



Date:  Thu Oct 26 15:52<br>



Subject:  Implications of Due Diligence<p>

While the focal point of the discussions in this seminar will be



the implications of corporate law compliance programs in



preventing corporate criminal liability and in reducing related



sentences, participants in the seminar should be aware that



corporate law compliance efforts have growing significance in a



number of other legal areas.  Compliance programs that satisfy the



compliance program standards now being developed by the NCPL will



stand a good chance of gaining benefits for firms in these other



legal areas.<p>







The ways that government standards and practices should be



reshaped to reward companies with strong compliance efforts was



the topic of a symposium recently hosted by the United States



Sentencing Commission.  This symposium, entitled "Corporate Crime



in America: Strengthening the 'Good Citizen' Corporation" included



discussions of a number of ways that rewards for firms with



substantial compliance programs are being incorporated into



liability standards and regulatory practices.<p>







The following is an excerpt from remarks I presented at this



symposium in order to summarize some of the developing trends



towards greater legal rewards for companies with substantial



compliance programs:<p>







<I>"The defining feature of this symposium has been the idea around



which this whole conference revolves -- the need to develop



distinctive, favorable legal treatment for the 'good citizen



corporation.'<p>







I submit that the concept of the good citizen corporation as



a feature of our legal landscape is not only new, but



fundamentally important.  By a good citizen corporation I mean the



type of corporation that has been the subject of our discussions



here -- a corporation that has undertaken due diligence to prevent



offenses in its business operations.  We are moving from a legal



regime in which the concept of the good citizen corporation was



irrelevant to a legal system in which this concept may be a



central consideration in evaluating corporate liability.



Currently, corporate criminal liability usually depends on



</i>respondeat superior<I> 



principles[legal doctrine whereby a master



may be held liable in certain circumstances for the wrongful acts



of his servant, or a company for the wrongful acts of its employees].



These principles effectively



equate an employee offender with the offender's corporation.  If



an employee commits an offense within his or her scope of



employment and for corporate benefit, then the corporation is



liable for the offense as well as



the employee.  We are moving from these principles for measuring



corporate liability towards a view that a corporation's



responsibility for an offense should be evaluated separately.



Under this new approach, the good citizen corporation that can



show due diligence concerning law compliance may avoid liability



for an occasional, aberrational employee offense.  In short, the



law is shifting towards a system in which the culpability of the



organization matters.<p>







This is a significant change that has broad implications.  I



want to sketch a few of the legal developments that may implement



this new approach in the next few years.  You have seen hints of



some of these developments here at this symposium.  My comments



are aimed at suggesting how the good citizen corporation may



figure in additional legal standards.<p>







One type of change that seems likely is an expansion of the



range of legal contexts in which good citizen corporations are



exempted from liability.  We have heard suggestions at this



symposium of corporate criminal liability standards that would



turn on whether a company undertook due diligence to prevent



offenses before a particular employee committed an offense.  Such



standards would shift the assessment of the quality of a



corporation's law compliance efforts from the sentencing stage --



where they reside under the Sentencing Commission's Organizational



Sentencing Guidelines -- to the liability determination phase of



the criminal case.<p>







There are several ways that this sort of change may be



implemented.  Standards may be changed so that the absence of



corporate due diligence needs to be shown to establish corporate



criminal liability.  More plausibly, corporate due diligence of



this sort may be recognized as a basis for an affirmative defense



to corporate criminal liability.  These sorts of changes need not



be limited to criminal offenses.  I think that we will see



equivalent developments in regulatory settings in which



definitions of regulatory violations are revised to turn on



whether or not a corporation has undertaken diligent efforts to



prevent violations.<p>







This is still not a broad enough perspective, however.  I



think that we are going to see greater reliance on the good



citizen corporation concept in law enforcement activities.  In



particular, the targeting of government investigations and



regulatory oversight will increasingly depend on prior assessments



of how extensively particular corporations are policing



themselves.  Experimental programs now being tried by the EPA



illustrate how the good citizen corporation might be treated in



this context.  Under these



programs, companies that submit to an intensive review of their



compliance systems can qualify for later relaxation of



governmental oversight.  Once the internal policing within these



companies is shown to be sound, the need for external reviews is



correspondingly diminished.  This sort of targeting of regulatory



oversight makes sense not only as a means for allocating scare



regulatory resources, but also as a means to recognize and reward



corporations that have pursued socially beneficial efforts to



prevent offenses.<p>







The status of a firm as a good citizen corporation may also



have growing significance in other legal contexts.  For example,



it was suggested in Joe Murphy's presentation that punitive



damages should not be assessed against a corporate defendant in a



tort action if the corporation is found to have taken diligent



steps to prevent the misconduct at stake.  Withholding punitive



damages on this basis would be a logical means to reserve such



damages for the worst cases of irresponsible corporate conduct.



In addition, standards diminishing punitive damages for good



citizen corporations would strongly encourage diligent law



compliance and harm prevention efforts in areas where tort actions



and damages are real threats, but criminal sanctions are not.<p>



Finally, a firm's status as a good citizen corporation may



figure in day to day contracting and commerce.  Perhaps the most



significant activity discussed at this conference was the



development of ISO 14000, a standard for measuring the sufficiency



of environmental law compliance systems.  Once issued, this



standard is intended to figure in a system of privately enforced



compliance system obligations in which one contracting party will



insist that its contracting partners certify their compliance with



ISO 14000.  Maintaining an adequate compliance program -- and



being a good citizen corporation, at least in the respects



addressed in ISO 14000 -- will be a matter of contract obligations



and incentives.  Hence, a system of private contracting and



rewards may ultimately drive the development of better compliance



practices."</i><p>

Subject: What is happening?<p>



Not to rain on anyone's parade but, as a criminal defense lawyer

for a couple decades, I have seen the disasters which ensue in the

wake of a criminal indictments.  I am also very suspicious of

depending on the government's good will vis a vis its citizens,

individual and corporate.  And, for some reason, terms like "Good

Citizen Corporation" make me nervous.<p>



There is something to be said for the proposition that we

shouldn't have to turn each other in under the fear of substantial

punishment if we don't and less substantial punishment if we do.

And I can't help saying again that we, as individuals, grow up

with the comfort that in this country we did not have to spy on

each other and snitch each other off.  Not so anymore.<p>



In any event, the above post raises interesting issues, for

instance, whether the substantive laws could be amended to allow

for a defense based on due diligence.  That is something we have

not seen yet and would be the kind of codified limit on government

power that is critical. Is there anything in the works?<p>



I would also like to know more specifically whether or not the

Department of Justice has or will amend the United States

Attorney's Manual to include specific guidelines on not seeking an

indictment in deference to due diligence.  I believe section

9-27.110 presently describes filing discretion in general.<p>



I do not mean to take away from the other issues discussed, such

as limits in civil liability, freedom from intensive audits,

exemption from punitive damages and, even, reduction in fines and

other criminal penalties.  However, IMHO there needs to be much

more emphasis on concrete rules regarding whether or not there

will be a criminal indictment sought in the first place.  The

[Federal] Sentencing Guidelines [("FSGs") for Organizations ] have 

turned the law enforcement

system upside down.  They do not provide for not prosecuting, they

simply say that consideration will be given for compliance systems

and voluntary disclosures in terms of the criminal sentence.  This

also does not take into consideration the Draconian application of

the FSGs to the individuals who will be offered up in the course

of all this.  Believe me, the government has always had tremendous

power when it chooses to investigate and more when it indicts; the

individual FSGs gave it more power (and Judges less discretion)

at sentencing; now the Organizational FSGs have given the

government the benefit of a nationwide posse without any mandatory

reduction in the power to indict and with only vague promises at

sentencing.<p>



In any event, is there any movement at the legislative, agency, or

prosecutorial stage to <I>codify</i> a commitment not to prosecute

corporations and "good citizen" officers in return for snitching

off fellow corporate employees?  Is there any serious effort from

the business community to support reductions in mandatory minimum

sentences and the individual FSGs so that technically guilty

fellow employees are not confined forever by the federal Bureau of

Prisons?  Is there any concern from corporate officers that

voluntary disclosure may result in mandatory prison for almost

randomly selected corporate officers on offenses which have no

requisite criminal intent?<p>



I know that the FSGs for Organizations has created a cottage

industry of compliance experts, compliance audits, and compliance

publications.  But what about the companies which are fined and

"disgorged" out of business and what about all those human beings

who will become felons and go to prison as a result of this?  I

respectfully submit that we need to strongly challenge the

underlying assumptions and not surrender what is left of our

autonomy to the government while discussing the details of

implementing the brave new world of compliance.<p>



It is just my opinion,<p>

Subject: Three ideas<p>



In an editorial I wrote for Preventive Law Reporter VOL. 13 #4,

winter 1994, I expressed three ideas that seem to be coming to the

surface in these discussions:<p><OL>



<LI><H4>Develop prosecutorial guidelines.</h4> So far as I know (and I

really know very little about this subject) there is great

variation in the kinds of situations where there will be a

prosecution. The suggestion is that there should be standards or

guidelines directed to prosecutors giving as much detail as is

practical, concerning the kinds of situations where there should

be prosecution. That is, prosecutorial discretion should be

predictable. Etc.<p>



<LI><H4>Permit evidence of compliance review in the case in chief.</h4> As

of now, there are two steps in a prosecution and sentence. Where

the defendant is found guilty, a second proceeding allows

introduction of compliance review process. The suggestion is to

permit compliance to be introduced in the case in chief. That

would be a way of allowing the jury or judge to test whether there

should have been a prosecution at all. It would also further

encourage corporations to establish and maintain compliance

review.<p>



<LI><H4>Allow due diligence and advice of counsel as a defense.</h4> This is

a bit stretching but we do allow the defense where there is a

penalty (for example, tax fraud and other situations). Further

encouragement to corporation to go forward with compliance. One

aspect of this is to recognize that our laws and regulations are

so numerous and often so complex that we need to do what we can to

encourage compliance.</OL><p>



Some of this seems to me needed because we seem to be developing

into the privatization of enforcement. The government cannot be

expected to enforce all of these laws/regulations (certainly not

when we are so obsessed with tax reduction). So we are leading

into an era of privatization of enforcement where each enterprise

is to be its own police. Or something like that.

I probably did a better job of saying this in the editorial which

you are encouraged to read....<p>

Date: Fri Oct 27 14:10:07 1995<br>

Subject: Implications of Due Diligence<p>



Just a response to a few of the points raised in the prior

message:<p><OL>



<LI> Regarding DOJ standards on withholding indictments in cases of

due diligence towards law compliance, these sorts of standards do

exist in some areas.  For an example, see Department of Justice,

Factors in Decisions on Criminal Prosecutions for Environmental

Violations in the Context of Significant Voluntary Compliance of

Disclosure Efforts By the Violator (July 1, 1991) (reprinted in R.

Gruner, Corporate Crime and Sentencing Appendix E. (1994)).<p>



<LI> The federal sentencing guidelines for organizational offenders

did not address the issue of whether firms that engage in due

diligence should be immune from liability because this questions

was beyond the jurisdiction of the Sentencing Commission.  The

Commission was authorized to set sentencing standards.  The

sentencing standards which the Commission has promulgated

necessarily assume that any party brought under those standards

has already been convicted of an offense.  Hence, the application

of other standards for determining which parties are or are not

prosecuted or convicted was not something that the Commission was

authorized to address.  Nor would the implementation of a due

diligence defense or a set of prosecutorial discretion standards

turning on due diligence be inconsistent with the Commission's

guidelines.<p>



<LI> While there is no magic in the term "Good Citizen

Corporation", there is an underlying notion that I think is now

gaining growing acceptance.  This notion is that an organizational

actor (particularly a large corporation) has a positive duty to

engage in self-policing of activities carried out on its behalf

and, perhaps, a duty to aid public law enforcement when violations

are detected.  This responsibility comes as a condition of being

offered the privilege of acting in a corporate form.  Those

entities that fulfill these responsibilities may have an

opportunity to reduce their liability when their affairs are

conducted through illegal conduct, provided that the sort of due

diligence defense or prosecutorial discretion standards discussed

in my earlier message are observed.    This is a better state of

affairs than would prevail under the standard federal rule of

corporate criminal liability that would simply hold corporations

liable under respondeat superior standards for the acts of

corporate employees.<p>



<LI> To the extent that these pressures and rewards cause more

firms to surface illegal conduct in their operations, more

responsible individuals will be prosecuted.  This will both

improve the administration of justice by increasing the

correlation between crime and punishment and increase deterrents

against misconduct within corporate organizations.  Of course, due

process should not be sacrificed in carrying out these processes.

However, objections to the evolving system  of corporate

self-policing and related increases in prosecutions should be

aimed at including due process protections within the new system,

not at doing away this system as a whole.</ol><p>

Appended by: Joe Murphy -- Bell Atlantic - Philadelphia<br>

Date: Fri Oct 27 15:48:42 1995<br>

Subject: What is happening?<p>



Bob - For many of us who have been working in this area for awhile

(2 decades, in my case) the points you raise have been central

ones.  There is clearly a need to recognize positively those

companies that have made a serious effort to prevent misconduct.

Unfortunately, much of the legal system actually works to deter

and even punish effective compliance efforts.<p>



Regarding the due diligence defense, there has been a fair amount

written about that.  Harvey Pitt and Karl Groskaufmanis did a

major piece on this in the Georgetown Law Journal.  As Richard

Gruner indicated, this view has found acceptance in some places.

For example, I know there have been some antitrust cases where

evidence of a compliance program was admitted in the defense of

liability.  And in the civil area, the Supreme Court has said this

is a defense in hostile work environment sexual harassment cases.<p>



Your point about standards to control prosecutors is a good one.

The sources Richard refers to (e.g., DOJ's July 1, 1991 statement)

still leave it up to the prosecutor's discretion.  This same point

also applies to offering immunity for those who voluntarily

self-disclose.  The Antitrust Division does, in fact, offer a

binding commitment not to prosecute a company or its employees, if

it is the first one to turn itself in, and it helps the government

get the goods on other potential defendants (e.g., in a

pricefixing case).  Recently a number of states have passed laws

in the environmental area giving immunity to those who voluntarily

disclose violations.  This is a step in the right direction, but

we need much more in this area.<p>



So I do not see your comments as "raining on anyone's parade";

just a reminder that we need to carry umbrellas with us when we do

any compliance work.   Joe Murphy

Our company is developing a corporate compliance program.  Of

course, it is our intent to comply with all applicable laws.  What

areas of the law are most important for a manufacturing company to

specifically include in its program?  What areas do your companies

specifically address in your programs?<p>

Subject: Compliance Considerations<p>



You do not mention whether or not your company imports or exports.

If it does, you will want to include the substantive areas covered

by the applicable agencies. Whether or not you do, we have a

number of clients who differentiate their ISO compliance from

their corporate compliance. They do so with two separate manuals.

They start by establishing the issues of most importance to them

in determining compliance. Those general principles are approved

at the Board level by resolution. The next step is setting out how

compliance will be obtained and then who will enforce it.<p>



Does the compliance group within the company have full access to

and the complete support of management? Are there benefits and

incentives to being part of the compliance group, etc?<p>



It is also important to have "teeth" in the program so that when

violations occur, as they inevitably do because we are all human,

discipline is set out in the personnel manual and it is evenly

enforced.<p>



We have found with our clients that the substantive areas are

generally determined by the number and nature of the agencies with

which our clients deal, federal, state and local. With more

information about the products you manufacture,  I could make more

suggestions.<p>

I understand you are looking for a kind of compliance inventory

list, of subject areas to address in a compliance program.  To

give a good answer I'd need to know much more about your business.

However, I'll try to list some possible areas here.  I would not

limit this to federal crimes, but would consider a broad range of

legal and ethical risk areas.  There is a more comprehensive list

in 2 Corporate Conduct Quarterly 35 (Winter 1992).<p>



Possible areas:  Workplace safety, environment, product safety,

antitrust, EEO/labor law (e.g., FLSA), international (e.g., FCPA,

export control, Antiboycott, etc.)(if you do international work),

PAC's/lobbying, securities law/insider trading, government

contract requirements (if you do any work for the government),

intellectual property, taxes, consumer protection,

documents/records management, consent decrees (if you have ever

had any scrapes with the government before), and conflicts of

interest.<p>



Hope this is helpful.   Joe<p>

Subject: Corporate Compliance<p>



When we set up our program, we started by doing a basic inventory

of the legal areas set out in Chapter 2 of the [Federal Sentencing Guidelines].

That outlines the crimes that are subject to the FSG's.  It's a good

starting point to get your orientation.  Our frame of reference

was conceptualizing any infraction that "a corporate

organization," not necessarily mine -- could commit, understanding

the nature of the infraction.<p>



Then, using that, we broadened it out to all civil, as well as

criminal matters, including regulatory programs.<p>



We then made sure to consider state and local counterparts as well.<p>



Then, we dropped into the netherworld of ethics to fill in gaps.<p>



I agree with the others who answered your question.  A complete

response depends upon a knowledge of your business and its risks.

But, generically, this is a good way to start.  Joe Murphy's list,

I might add, is a very complete one.<p>



We have some written materials on this.  If they would be of help

to you, let me know.  I'd be glad to fax them to you.  Just give

me your number.<p>

Subject:  Compliance Examples -- NCPL<p>    

The contributions made to the seminar this past week have been  

sterling; on behalf of the National Center for Preventive Law  

(NCPL) I want to thank all who took part.  As we post the balance  

of our compliance guidelines this week and next, I hope they  

and the discussion they generate provide as much that is useful to  

all as the commentary has been to our group.<p>    

There is one special opportunity in which we hope all will  

participate to the extent they are able.  We have been trying to  

collect concrete, practical "examples" of what companies are  

actually doing, to illustrate the  

<A HREF="http://www.courttv.com/legalhelp/business/seminar/654.html">  

twenty principles</a> and their associated considerations.  

(Very much like the "Illustrations"  

that appear in the ALI's Restatements.)  A  

<A HREF="http://www.courttv.com/legalhelp/business/seminar/652.html">model</a>  

or two were  

appended to the seminar at the outset, and are still available.  

(If you can't access or find them easily, leave an append here and  

we will get one out again.)  We would again invite anyone who  

wishes to do so, to offer an illustration draw from their own or  

their clients' experiences.  Even if it contradicts our stated  

Considerations!  So much the better in that case.<p>    

I thank you again for your participation; I hope our work is of  

use to you; and I look forward to hearing about your own methods  

and experiences, posted during the seminar for all to share.<p>    

Enjoy.<p>

Subject: Compliance Examples<p>    

Here are some compliance ideas (in no particular order) that I  

like:<p><UL>    

<LI>Include a compliance message with new employee orientation  

materials.<p>    

<LI>Train the internal audit staff to look for legal violations in  

addition to accounting mistakes.<p>    

<LI>Work with the corporate training department to incorporate  

compliance messages in every training program administered by the  

company.<p>    

<LI>Attach a compliance training requirement to each job  

description, and track attendance at compliance programs in  

personnel records.<p>    

<LI>Make certain that a "hotline" service is available for the  

reporting of wrongdoing when the normal chain of command is  

inappropriate.<p>    

<LI>Review all compliance presentations and publications to make  

sure they cover two basic points a) what should I do/not do, and  

b) where do I go when I have a question (and there is no such  

thing as a stupid question).    

<LI>Train attorneys to be better teachers (i.e., presentation  

skills).<p>    

<LI>Use feedback to improve the communications of compliance  

messages.<p>    

<LI>Put compliance messages in simple, concrete terms (e.g., use  

examples from the business).<p>    

<LI>Get the chairman/president to record a 90-second video message  

emphasizing the importance of legal compliance in terms of the  

employee's future with the company and play it before  

presentations.<p></ul>

Subject: comments from an in-houser<p>    

[These comments are from a corporate counsel who prefers to remain  

anonymous.]<p><OL>    

<LI>Is this really anything more than "Don't lie, cheat or steal,  

and obey all applicable laws.  If in doubt, call this number."  

Those are pretty simple rules.  Everything else is education and  

procedure.  Only difficult questions are (a) whether to  

self-report and (b) how to punish the offender(s).<p>    

<LI>In-house attorneys deal with this from a different  

perspective.  As the contributors have already noted, The Game  

(congrats to the Braves, btw) is to avoid indictment.  The  

government contracting history is certainly instructive, as they  

are seven years ahead of the rest of the pack, at least.<p>    

<LI>If an employee has violated a policy of compliance with all  

applicable laws ("CWAALs"), and that was done without knowledge,  

the in-housers need to be prepared to bear part of the blame.  

Otherwise, fry the puppy, and do it publicly.<p>    

<LI>Many of the companies that have such policies have had some  

problems in the past.  Is there a message there?  This isn't all  

the terms of the consent decree.<p>    

<LI>Hopefully, these are more than attempts to insulate senior  

management from jail terms, as the front line folks are prone to  

think.  The front line has fairly sensitive bullshitometers, and  

will respond with a cya barrage if they are forced to get close to  

the line by senior management inaction.  That will raise even  

worse problems for an organization.  But you get what you expect  

from people, I guess.<p>    

<LI>I think that five years from now, after a little shakeout  

cruise, most publicly traded companies will have gotten the  

message that the preparation that you need to do to implement and  

maintain one of these programs, and to truly enforce it, saves big  

problems and headaches.  More importantly, it probably (although  

maybe not demonstrably) saves money.  It does, however, force the  

in-housers to engage in much more training and a lot less "pure  

lawyering."  That may get left for the outsides.  This aspect is  

not as much fun for some.  [Ted] Banks was right in his comments about  

the compliance examples, re[garding] the need for more education.  The  

self-reporting thing will, one hopes, be mandated by the  

shareholders, who will start to hold seniors accountable for the  

actions of those for whom they have "responsibility."  Isn't that  

called leadership?<p>    

<LI>Biggest problem is not self-reporting, it's avoiding number 5.  

If you win on number 5, you win.  Collect one brass ring.<p>    

<LI>Does success in these respects factor in to the seniors'  (or  

anyone else's) bonus rights/appraisal?  If not, both positively  

and negatively, it isn't going to happen.<p></ol>

Subject: Hillel's Dictum<p>    

This is in response to the anonymous counsel who suggested that an  

adequate compliance system would be the admonition, "Don't lie,  

cheat or steal.  Any questions, call this number."<p>    

Many years ago (a couple of centuries c.e., if I recall rightly)  

Hillel the Elder was challenged to teach all of the Judaic law  

while standing on one leg.  He said, while standing on one leg,  

"Treat others as you would have them treat you.  All the rest is  

commentary.  Go study."<p>    

I quite agree that finding the essence of a complex matter is  

critical, and efficient.  But I suspect it cannot be done in every  

setting at every moment while standing on one leg.  Still, I defer  

to experience.  Would the counsel do us the favor of sharing the  

actual experiences he has seen with the core admonition approach?  

Many thanks.<p>

Subject: Compliance Examples -- NCPL<p>    

This is a further response to the suggestion that an effective law  

compliance program is little more than an elaborate admonition  

along the lines of "Don't lie.  Don't steal....."<p>    

There are several reasons to think more broadly about compliance  

programs and related corporate management programs.  Here are a  

few:<p><OL>    

<LI>While some corporate crimes (e.g., fraud) are morally obvious  

(as was suggested by the prior "Don't steal..." comment), many  

newer offenses are not.  For example, would it be clear to the  

uninitiated that the failure to report certain cash transactions  

of over $10,000 is a federal offense?  The world of corporate  

crime is increasingly the world of the technical <i>malum prohibitum</i>  

offense [an act which is not inherently immoral, but becomes so because its commission is  

expressly forbidden by law].  One can argue whether such offenses should be imposed,  

but the current reality is that many corporate employees need a  

lot of information about laws (criminal and civil) that apply to  

their jobs.  Furthermore, they often need help to understand how  

bare legal requirements should be transformed into operational  

instructions about what to do on a day to day basis.  These  

matters are necessary targets of both training and follow up  

studies and audits to see if the employees are getting the  

message.<p>    

<LI>Liability rules such as the collective knowledge doctrine  

applied by some courts to impose corporate criminal liability can  

cause individual employees to have even less notice of when their  

actions will produce corporate liability.  Under that doctrine,  

information throughout an organization is aggregated to assess  

whether corporate actions were undertaken knowingly or willingly.  

For example, in <I>United States v. Bank of New England, 821 F.2d  

844 (1st Cir. 1987)</i>, knowledge of federal cash transaction  

reporting requirements held by one bank employee was combined with  

the conduct of bank tellers in failing to report certain  

transactions to find that the bank engaged in a knowing and  

willful violation of federal reporting standards.  Under these  

sorts of tests, firms will need to take a careful look at who  

within their organizations have related information and duties and  

then establish coordination procedures linking those employees to  

insure that inadvertent conduct by an uninformed individual does  

not lead to corporate liability.  These sorts of coordination  

arrangements are additional desirable features of compliance  

programs.<p>    

<LI>Even if law compliance programs were as simple as instructing  

employees "Don't steal, etc.....,"  

firms would still need to adopt audit programs and other  

investigative practices to insure that these instructions were  

carried out.  At least some periodic self-evaluation is probably  

necessary to cause employees to take a compliance instructions  

seriously and to determine if the instructions are complete and  

framed in effective terms.  Such monitoring is also critical if a  

firm hopes to convince prosecutors or courts that it operated a  

generally effective compliance program at the time of a violation.<p>    

<LI>Finally, although we are generally discussing programs to  

prevent criminal offenses in this seminar, the goals of a law  

compliance program should not be so narrowly framed.  The general  

purpose of such programs should be to enhance the legal position  

of the corporation in a systematic fashion.  Granted, part of the  

achievement of this goal will be the prevention of offenses and  

resulting corporate penalties and reputational impairment.  

However, the avoidance of civil liability will be another key  

element.  Additionally, strengthening the corporation's legal  

position relative to others can also be furthered by systematic  

efforts to understand and revise corporate practices with legal  

implications.  When these broader goals of compliance programs are  

considered, the need in compliance program designs for more  

elaborate direction of employee actions and monitoring of results  

is clearer.<p></ol>

The inside's job is to identify and to educate -- perhaps more

Were one to (subjunctive, condition contrary to fact) consider  

what purpose a compliance with all laws or whatever policy  

fulfills, beyond being but one arrow in the inhousers' educational  

quiver, one would be hard pressed to fill the blank.  It is but a  

yellow flag along the road, a mere indicator of when it is  

advisable to talk with One AllKnowing.<p>    

My call:  Spend the time educating and explaining and spreading  

the message far and wide.  That's what we're here for, brothers  

and sisters of the inhouse stripe.  Leave the policy  

pronouncements for the windbags.  All else is windows dressing,

Subject: Compliance Examples -- NCPL<p>    

In the spirit of evaluating what really works, I would respond to  

our anonymous insider that education is necessary, but not  

sufficient.  The test of the pudding is whether law compliance is  

treated with the same seriousness as other important management  

concerns.  What important management concern (e.g., product  

quality, cost reduction, etc.) is addressed only with education?  

Even with the best law compliance education program, management  

(including inside counsel) needs to follow up with periodic  

monitoring of compliance levels and more intensive investigations  

of revealed compliance failures.  Furthermore, persons found to  

have failed to maintain compliance should receive discipline and  

publicity should be given to the administration of such discipline  

(although perhaps not to the identify of the disciplined parties  

to the extent that this can be concealed).  Absent these types of  

steps, it is likely that a program will not be effective.  

Employees will not take it seriously (they know what steps  

management takes towards matters that management really thinks are  

important) and misconduct that could have been detected and  

prevented will go on unabated.<p>    

Pretend that law compliance is a performance quality control  

problem.  What would your concern do to insure quality?  Consider  

the same sorts of practices regarding law compliance.<p>

Subject: Compliance Examples -- NCPL<p>    

For what it's worth, and to state the utterly obvious....An  

effective compliance program is not simply a matter of "If you  

build it, they will come."  You can write all of the manuals you  

want to, hold all of the training programs you have time for,  

audit the heck out of your operations, and fire any employee who  

even has a bad thought.  You can write 50-page documents  

accompanied by glitzy videotapes, or you can hand out 3X5 cards  

that say "Don't do anything illegal, immoral, or fattening."  In  

the end, the form and content aren't really that important  

(ignoring, of course, the FSG's, which do require a certain amount  

of tangible evidence).  All you've created is an elaborate  

corporate police force, which, speaking personally, I find an  

utterly distasteful way to practice in-house law.<p>    

I'm a relative newcomer to Caremark (only here since April), so I  

arrived just in time for our $161 million settlement/guilty pleas  

with the U.S. government, fortunately missing most of the 4-year  

OIG-investigation experience most of my Caremark Law Group  

colleagues so bravely and painfully endured. But as the  

in-house attorney who is now part of the Corporate Integrity Team  

and an active participant in the development and implementation of  

our Corporate Integrity Program, I can tell you that although the  

existence of the tangibles of compliance are important (and, in  

our case, mandated as a result of our settlement with the  

government), they don't mean a damn thing if a commitment to  

integrity and fair dealing isn't part of the corporate culture,  

the way people think about and act and do their jobs.   Teach it  

all you want.  If someone's out to beat the system, they will.<p>    

And that's the really hard part of an effective compliance  

program.  Integrity is really tough to teach.  Integrity is  

sometimes even tougher to exercise when you're competing in an  

industry where not everyone else does.  People within the  

organization have to feel it, and those who don't have to be  

"supported" and "encouraged" and "guided" by those who do.  Those  

who don't ultimately "get it" have suffer the consequences, no  

matter how much they contribute to the bottom line.<p>    

Enough of the sermon. <p>    

Although I've been following this discussion since it's inception,  

I've not commented until now because, as one who is deep in the  

midst of a government-mandated and unbelievably far-reaching  

compliance program, anytime I've tried to attach a specific  

comment, it seemed utterly inadequate (as does the one I've just  

created).  So I will make the following offer:  If anyone has  

specific questions about what we're doing, what we're required to  

do, how we're getting it done, etc., I'd be happy to talk, either  

through this discussion group or, if you'd prefer, by phone, at  

708-559-5459.  I may not be able to talk to you at the time you  

call, but I'd be happy to set up a time that works for us both.<p>    

Just one final caveat:  Get a compliance program in place that  

works - if you don't, the government will solve the problem for  

you, and you won't like their solution one bit!<p>

[<I>This is a third comment from the anonymous corporate counsel participating  

in the discussion.</i>]<p>    

Re[garding] Mr. Gruner's comment that education is not everything there is  

about corporate compliance.<p>    

We agree.<p>    

But what is the lawyer's role in such a program (or, better,  

process)?<p>    

One difference between a product quality program and a compliance  

with all laws policy is that the business people feel they know  

what product quality means (whether they do or not is a different  

panel).  They will do surveys of what customers feel is important,  

and apply their own business sense.<p>    

In the law area, though, the Guild has kept the keys to the  

Kingdom of Knowledge, or at least the pace and  

complexity/ambiguity of new laws is such that no mortal (or even  

an attorney) can truly master it all.  Business people count on  

the lawyers to identify the laws that might apply and to explain  

them in business terms.<p>    

Having done that, it is perhaps someone else's job to decide what  

to do if someone does a no-no.  The impact of not reacting is,  

perhaps, a matter with legal import; but it is just a matter of  

judgment  (in which the lawyers have no better or worse judgment)  

as to how much to react.<p>    

But we certainly agree that if the organization does not Truly  

Believe that this is important, no amount of training will matter.  

Nor will a policy or a program.  This is as true with product  

quality as it is with law.  We would prefer to be elsewhere when  

the Federal Boot drops.<p>    

OTOH, if the organization Believes, then training and guidance  

might be a big part of having a process that works.<p>

Subject:  Compliance Examples<p>  

The anonymous comments about self-reporting raise serious issues. 

In many respects, the decision whether or not to report when not 

mandated by law, and how to report, are among the most troublesome 

and those without general rules of thumb.  To be sure, the 

advantages the FSGs offer in mitigation of sentence are not 

available to those who do not self-report.  Nonetheless, most 

companies make decisions about reporting on a case by case 

basis.<p>  

They may decide that in certain circumstances, the benefits the 

FSGs offer do not justify the risk occasioned by involvement with 

regulators that might  otherwise be avoided.<p>  

I am not sure that shareholders, as you suggest, are oftentime in 

a position to encourage disclosure except that if management 

erroneously decides not to report and a serious investigation 

nonetheless results, management will probably lose their jobs. 

Independent directors, on the other hand, are more likely to be in 

a position to demand self-reporting.  Further, their likely 

independence from the wrongdoing or wrongdoers and their 

disinclination to incur risk makes them likely candidates to 

demand disclosure even when such disclosure is not required. 

Thus, in public companies with independent directors, disclosure 

is practically more likely than it might otherwise be.<p>

"Obey the law & call if you have a question" should be 

considered the starting point of a compliance program.  Obviously, 

there is lots more.  In corporations, one of the most common ways 

to ensure compliance is to establish procedures that do not allow 

any flexibility to break various laws.  For example, a salesman in 

my company would have a difficult time fixing prices, since he 

would not have authority to set the price.  OTOH, it is precisely 

these kind of rigid policies or procedures that can result in 

excessively bureaucratic, static, unimaginative corporations, that 

end up going down the drain.   So, the goal of the corporation is 

to establish minimum level of procedures necessary to ensure 

financial controls and legal compliance, while giving the 

employees room to do their jobs creatively.  The lawyer must work 

with all of the assets of the corporation (training department, 

internal audit, executives) to make sure that the compliance 

message comes through in an environment where the employee has some 

freedom to make choices.<p>

<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3><p>



From: Christina Cooley -- Counsel Connect - Atlanta<br>

Date:  Mon Oct 30 08:50<br>

Subject:  PR. 8-Structure and Control<p>



<H4>NATIONAL CENTER FOR PREVENTIVE LAW WORKING GROUP DRAFT</h4>



<H3>Establishing Compliance Programs, Continued. . .</h3>



<I>Note:  Principle #8 and its Considerations are intended to

address the following aspect of the <a href=../../../../download/seminars/fsg1.html>

Federal Sentencing Guidelines: Sec. 8A1.2(k)</a>(2):  "Specific individual(s) within high-level

personnel of the organization must have been assigned overall

responsibility to oversee compliance with such standards and

procedures."</i><p>



<H4>Principle #8: Specific high-level personnel in an organization

are responsible for the administration and oversight of the

compliance program.</h4><p>



Factors to Consider:<p>



(a) Having an organizational compliance officer take "ownership"

of the compliance function in the sense of having overall

responsibility for initiating, coordinating and reviewing

organizational compliance efforts.<p>



(b) Insuring that the top organizational executive with

responsibility for a compliance program has the degree of clout

necessary to make the program effective.<p>



(c) Making the types of expertise available to a compliance

officer that are needed to help operate a compliance program

effectively.<p>



(d) Selecting a compliance officer with personal characteristics

that will make the individual effective in leading and promoting

organizational compliance efforts.<p>



(e) Determining what functions, if any, the compliance officer

should perform besides management and oversight of compliance

activities.<p>



(f) Considering whether the designation of one person with

primary responsibility for management of compliance practices will

lead others in the organization to conclude that compliance is

only the compliance officer's job.<p>



(g) Identifying resources, support and infrastructure needed by

the compliance officer and others to pursue compliance

effectively.<p>



(h) Determining the compliance officer's proper level of authority

and access to the organization's governance authorities in order

to insure both that the officer is able to exert effective control

over compliance-related matters and that compliance management is

perceived as an important activity by other organization

members.<p>



We urge you to submit comments and examples about the above

Principle.  To assist you in this, please review the postings

from the first day of the seminar, October 23, on the <a href=../../../../download/seminars/fsg1.html>Federal

<H3>Establishing Compliance Programs, Continued. . .</h3><p>



<I>Note:  Principle #9 and its Considerations are intended to

address the following aspects of the <a href=../../../../download/seminars/fsg1.html>

Federal Sentencing Guidelines: Sec. 8A1.2(k</a> (1): "The organization must have

established compliance standards and procedures to be followed

by its employees and other agents that are reasonably capable

of reducing the prospect of criminal conduct," and Sec. 8A1.2(k):

"The hallmark of an effective program to prevent and detect

violations of law is that the organization exercised due

diligence in seeking to prevent and detect criminal conduct by

its employees and other agents."</i><p>



<H4>Principle #9:  A compliance program has the support of senior

management of the organization.  Each officer, manager and

employee is responsible for supporting and complying with the

compliance program's standards and procedures.</h4><p>



Factors to Consider:<p>



(a) Having participation in and support for the program

throughout the organization rather than limiting visible

support for compliance to a compliance officer.<p>



(b) Considering the consistency of the incentive, appraisal and

recognition systems used within the organization, with the idea

that compliance is a widespread responsibility and should be

reflected in those systems.<p>



(c) Examining the variety of ways senior management can send

the message that it considers a specific compliance behavior or

objective to be high priority.<p>



(d) Determining the degree to which the management of

compliance or ethical practices by subordinates is part of day-

to-day responsibility.<p>



(e) Determining the compliance roles of organizational agents

and further participants in the organization's business

activities other than employees.<p>



(f) Examining the express and implied messages that managers

give to employees about meeting the organization's compliance

goals.<p>

<H3>Establishing Compliance Programs, Continued. . .</h3>



<I>Note:  Principle #10 and its Considerations are intended to

address the following aspect of the <a href=../../../../download/seminars/fsg1.html>

Federal Sentencing Guidelines: Sec. 8A1.2(k)</a>(3): The organization must have used due

care not to delegate substantial discretionary authority to

individuals whom the organization knew, or should have known

through the exercise of due diligence, had a propensity to

engage in illegal activities."</i><p>



Structure and Control Continued



<H4>Principle #10:  The organization exercises due diligence to

determine whether persons to whom substantial discretionary

authority is delegated have a propensity to engage in illegal

activities and to prevent such delegation to those persons.</h4>



Factors to Consider:<p>



(a) Adopting a written policy that the organization will not

knowingly employ anyone who is under indictment, convicted, or

listed as disbarred, suspended or otherwise ineligible for

Federal programs.<p>



(b) Carrying out this policy through reasonable inquiries into

the status of any potential employee or consultant.<p>



(c) Suspending indicted employees or consultants from

involvement in company activities until their cases are

resolved.<p>



(d) Suspending employees or consultants who are involved in

disbarment proceedings from further company activities until

the disbarments are resolved.<p>



(e) Discharging any employee who is convicted or disbarred.<p>



(f) Exercising care in hiring processes to investigate and

consider evidence of past misconduct that is relevant to the

position being sought.<p>



(g) Exercising care in promotions and internal transfers to

consider an individual employees' past job performance and

internal reputation concerning  compliance and the employee's

adherence to the organization's compliance program.<p>



(h) Identifying positions that may provide opportunities for

violations or act as breeding grounds for violations and more

carefully screening candidates for those positions with respect

to compliance backgrounds and support.<p>



(i) Addressing the risk of discriminatory personnel practices

and invasions of privacy when an open-ended standard like

"propensity" to do something must be applied.<p>

<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3><p>



From: Cloyd Laporte, III -- Counsel Connect - New York<br>

Date:  Wed Nov  1 10:28<br>

Subject:  Costs of Compliance<p>



Today's Wall Street Journal reports that the Small Business

Administration (SBA) has presented a study to Congress showing

that small businesses spent a total of $265 Billion complying with

federal regulations in 1992, or about $5,400 per employee for

companies with fewer than 500 workers. In contrast, larger

companies (>500 employees) spent $130 Billion or $3,000 per

employee.<p>



The Journal quotes Jere Glover, SBA's chief counsel for advocacy,

"[O]ne conclusion is beyond dispute. Small businesses bear a

disproportionate share of this nation's annual regulatory bill[,].

11/2/95 at B2.<p>



Can an effective compliance program reduce these costs? Should

compliance efficiency, as well as efficacy, be a goal of a

compliance program? The 

<a href=../../../../download/seminars/principle1.html>

NCPL's Twenty Principles</a> seem equally

applicable to small and large businesses, but can a small company

afford to implement them?<p>



[By the way, I checked the <A HREF="http://www.sbaonline.sba.gov/">

SBA home page</a> on the Web, and the study isn't available

there as of this morning. I did post a request there, and will

check again later this week].<p>

Appended by: Richard S. Gruner -- Whittier Law School - Los Angeles<br>

Date: Wed Nov  1 12:30:29 1995<br>

Subject:<p>



A systematic effort to pursue law compliance should aid small

business in the following ways:<p><OL>



<LI>Efforts that are undertaken can be limited to those with a

high likelihood of success.  By thinking through law compliance

programs in advance, small firms can avoid throwing away their

highly limited resources on ineffective compliance efforts.<p>



<LI>Systematic law compliance efforts can achieve levels of

efficiency that isolated, haphazard efforts will not.  To some

extent, this probably explains why the study described in the

previous message found that larger concerns were spending less per

employee on compliance.  The larger concerns may simply be

pursuing compliance more efficiently because they are able to get

more mileage out of some of their compliance efforts.  Small

businesses can do the same in some areas.  Where a small firm will

engage in a particular activity repeatedly, it will be worthwhile

to work out related law compliance measures on a systematic

basis.<p>



<LI>While small concerns can not justify the same scope and

formality of programs as larger firms, the small companies should

undertake some compliance efforts in the areas addressed by the

NCPL standards.  This issue is addressed in proposed standards for

environmental compliance programs now being considered by the U.S.

Sentencing Commission.  While these proposed standards discuss

compliance efforts regarding environmental law compliance, most of

the comments are relevant to compliance efforts in broader areas.

In discussing the need for compliance efforts in small concerns,

the proposed standards noted:<p>



<I>"It should be emphasized that in assessing the extent of an

organization's commitment [to environmental law compliance], both

the size and the nature of the organization are very important.

Ordinarily, organizations with larger numbers of operating

facilities or pollution control activities and obligations should

have more extensive and sophisticated environmental management

systems, programs and resources of the nature described in the

[proposed standards] than would be expected of similar, but

smaller organizations.  Similarly, organizations whose business

activities may pose significant risks of harm to human health or

the environment from non-compliance with environmental

requirements (e.g., manufacture, use or management of hazardous

products, materials or wastes) should have more extensive and

sophisticated systems, programs and resources than would be

expected of comparably sized organizations in less risky types of

business.<p>



"Small organizations should demonstrate the same degree of

commitment to environmental compliance as larger ones, although

generally with less formality and less dedicated resources (if

any) than would be expected of larger organizations.  While each

of the functions and objectives described in [proposed standards]

should be substantially satisfied by all organizations, the small

organization typically will rely on management personnel,

operations personnel or others to assume compliance support

responsibilities in addition to their routine duties, and will

have less sophisticated systems for establishing compliance

procedures, auditing and tracking compliance issues, training

employees and carrying out the other programmatic components of

their compliance effort.  For example, in a very small business,

the manager or proprietor, as opposed to independent compliance

personnel, might perform routine audits with a simple checklist,

train employees through informal staff meetings, and perform

compliance monitoring through daily "walk-arounds" or continuous

observation while managing the business.  In appropriate

circumstances, this reliance on existing resources and simple

systems can demonstrate the same degree of commitment that, for a

much larger organization, would require, for example, a full-time

audit department, a training staff, an active compliance

monitoring staff, and computer systems for tracking the resolution

of compliance issues.<p>



"The essential requirement is that each organization must

demonstrate, through appropriate documentation, that the resources

and management processes it utilized were reasonably determined to

be sufficient to perform the basic functions described in Part D.

If, prior to the conviction, the organization had a reasonable

basis to believe that its commitment of resources and processes

would be sufficient, given its size and the nature of its

business, then an appropriate mitigation value should be applied

even though that commitment proved insufficient to prevent the

offense of conviction."</i></ol><p>

Subject: Costs of Compliance<p>



Cloyd,<p>

In addition to Richard's points about scaling the compliance

efforts to match the risk and resources of the company, there are

other sides to the cost issue.<p>



First, I would not describe the effort as a "law" compliance

program.  It is really a form of  exercising control;  the subject

need not be limited to the company's compliance with law.  The

fact is that a good system for controlling the business' conduct

from a legal and ethical point of view can result in the entity

being more efficient as well.<p>



Second, I think smaller businesses are overlooking the

opportunities to pool costs with other businesses.  For example,

small businesses could work through trade associations and other

groups to arrange group training, operate a hotline, and share

other resources.<p>



A third point is that a good compliance program will detect

instances where the company itself is the victim or potential

victim of costly wrongdoing, such as employee theft.  In smaller

and start-up businesses where controls are notoriously lax, having

an effective compliance program, with the awareness of risk that

this can create, can more than pay for the cost of the effort just

in this area of self-protection.<p>



Of course, there is also the value of preventing company

violations of law and the resultant harm and costs associated with

that.    Joe Murphy<p>

This is an area which should give rise to a great deal of thought

and it would be good to see a discussion here.<p>



Earlier, we posed a number tough questions and a bit of hard

reality in a thread entitled "Pitfalls."  Suffice it to say, from

the prospective of a criminal defense lawyer who is often not

called in until after the search warrants are served, the

indictment is returned or folks are arrested, criminal prosecution

is not a pleasant matter.  It can end the life of the corporation

and it can change the life forever of the individual.  Of course,

we fight hard to avoid these dire results but, even in a

successful defense, the toll is great.<p>



The guidelines and Principle #14 highlight certain specific

questions of importance to the criminal defense lawyer (and of

importance to the potential and actual criminal defendants):<p><OL>



<LI>Even though voluntary disclosure may mitigate criminal

punishment, what steps can be taken to try to avoid the decision

to indict in the first place?<p>



<LI>When should corporate counsel advise employees that they have

a right (ought) to have the advice of counsel?<p>



<LI>When can the corporate counsel advise the employees?  When

should corporate counsel arrange for outside counsel?  Should

outside counsel be paid for by the company?<p>



<LI>How can you best preserve the attorney/client privilege and

the work product doctrine for the corporation?  For it's officers

and directors?  For other key employees?  Do you want to?<p>



<LI>Who amongst the corporation itself, the officers, directors

and key employees, if any, are going to throw themselves on their

swords to accept responsibility?   Will it do any good?<p>



<LI>Who is going to be thrown upon someone else's sword

involuntarily?  Will it do any good?<p>



<LI>Will you enter into a joint defense agreement with your

new-found codefendants?  Prior to indictment?  Post-indictment?<p>



<LI>Will corporate counsel assert the attorney/client privilege at

the grand jury?  As to what?  At the trial?  As to what?<p></ol>



Criminal defense lawyers, including myself, have some ideas -- and

a bunch of sea stories -- on each of these questions.  It would be

interesting to hear from corporate counsel as well.  Any thoughts?<p>

Bob,<p>


You raise quite a list of good questions.  I'd like to answer


them all, but my company keeps insisting that I do work, so I will


just offer a few words.<p>





You ask about avoiding prosecution.  My first goal is to avoid a


violation; if one occurs my goal is then to avoid prosecution.  If


all I am left with is a sentence reduction, then I will have


failed.  You are right to focus on the declination decision.<p>





How do you avoid prosecution?  I would look for several steps:


1)Have in place a compliance program with real teeth;  go light on


the paper and preaching, and heavy on audits, senior management


commitment, discipline, etc; 2)If you find a problem, react to it


quickly and fix it fast;  a company's reaction to a violation is


much more likely to get it into trouble than the violation itself;


3)Remedy the wrong; e.g., if you stole something, give it back;


4)Consider self-reporting; it is a gut-wrenching decision, but


there is no substitute for this from a prosecutor's point of view;


5)If you are going to self-report, use outside counsel who knows


the agency;  know what you are doing before you start on this


process.<p>





Some agencies have good programs for voluntary disclosure (e.g.,


the Antitrust Division; for others you just take your chances.


But a number of prosecutors have been saying the right words about


the value of compliance programs and voluntary disclosure in terms


of avoiding criminal prosecution.<p>





With respect to privilege, you cannot count on it, but I would


not give up the chance to assert it.  In conducting an


investigation, I would follow the path set out in the Upjohn case.<p>





If I was making a voluntary disclosure and decided to waive the


privilege, I would make sure the prosecutor understood how big a


concession we were making. Of course, I would  be very careful in


writing up the investigation, always assuming that others will


somehow see it.  For those who are interested, we've covered this


at some length in Compliance Programs and the Corporate Sentencing


Guidelines, chapter 5, on privileges.<p>

Subject: small co. & practicality<p>



This may have been touched upon elsewhere, but to what extent do

the rules change for smaller companies?  Not all companies are

Kraft with huge resources available.  Presumably there is some

rule of reason that allows for a more modest formal program --

maybe where some one says don't lie, cheat or steal -- when the

company is so small that that is the best that they can do.

Stated otherwise, though the substantive aspects of compliance

would not be different, from a procedural prospective, a

necessarily more lax program would exist.<p>



Moreover, I must be terribly naive, but I do not recall being told

in <I>any</i> job that I have ever had not to lie, cheat or steal (I

started working at a young age and have worked in a diverse number

of jobs).  I simply <I>assumed</i> one should not do those things.  Is

this view so unusual?  In Ben Bradlee's recent book, he talks

about the Janet Cooke affair (a reporter simply fabricated a

story, winning a Pulitzer and later disgrace).  My sense is that

it did not occur to him that one of his reporters would commit

that kind of fraud; he trusted them.  Isn't that attitude not too

uncommon?<p>

Subject: small co. & practicality<p>



Marc,<p>



On your first question, the Sentencing Guidelines do in fact take

size into account;  if the company is small, the program can be

less formal.<p>



Overall I think the Guidelines' definition of an effective

compliance program does offer a good start, even for small

companies. There are some weaknesses, but the standards show a

sensitivity to the need to have management involved in the

process.   I think, however, that sometimes people get off the

track in addressing the compliance question in general.  I am

particularly struck by the idea that the answer is  just telling

people not to do bad things, and then punishing those who disobey.<p>



I would describe this as the "preach and punish" theory.    The

real question to me is a very simple one to ask:  "What Works?"

Which steps really do affect how organizations behave, and which

steps are a waste of time.  Answering that question, however, is

anything but easy.<p>



I do not buy the "preach and punish" approach;  it is too

legalistic and it hasn't worked in organizations.  I believe that

organizations and the people in them act differently from

individuals. If you want to change the way an organization works,

you have to work with the organization's own management processes.

 You need to know the company's culture, you need its senior

management's active support, and you have to employ such

management processes as evaluations and appraisals, discipline,

auditing, management reporting, etc.  You use whatever the

management of that company would use to achieve results.<p>



Also, I do not see great success with the preach and punish model

even  in dealing with individuals outside of organizations.   Most

people are not motivated solely by fear;   incentives and other

positives, and the influence of one's peers, play a very important

role that the legal system and lawyers seem to overlook.<p>



As for the newspaper example, the question for me is whether they

checked the background of the person they hired.  I do not see a

need for rigid restrictions and structures imposed on companies.

But I am not naive about people in organizations.  Corporations,

especially big ones, have an enormous capacity to cause harm.  If

management is aware of a risk area, it is reasonable to expect

management to take the types of preventive steps that are designed

to deal with that risk.  When I buy medicine from a pharmaceutical

company, I do not care what their management style is or whether

the company is large or small.  But I want to be sure they are

checking what comes off the production line, and that their

employees care about the quality of their products.  After all,

while on the surface when we discuss compliance we are just

talking about one more area of the law, in a very real sense we

are addressing a matter that affects the health, safety and well

being of each of us.  That leads me to my original focus:  We need

to ask what works to prevent misconduct in companies.  Some parts

of this pursuit may be easy, but others will require all of our

best efforts to find answers.<p>

<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3><p>



From: Edward Dauer -- Denver Law School - Denver<br>

Date:  Sun Nov  5 12:15<br>

Subject:  Rules and Reason<p>



I am, as always, fascinated by the conversations in this

[seminar] -- in this case, on the relative uses of rules (mechanical

compliance things) and reason (education about what's right and

what's wrong).  In my view, as something of an outsider to the

corporate world, the blend of Ted Banks' and Susan Macauley's

ideas makes great good sense.  Neither rules nor reason are

sufficient, to some degree both are necessary, yet each used alone

(or used to excess) can create more problems than it solves.<p>



I wonder, however, whether the use of rules (systems,

contrivances, mechanical things) doesn't have a place beyond the

evidence of law-abidingness that Susan mentions, and as part of

the culture that Ted says is important.  Doesn't the use of a

system (but not a rigid one) act as the reminder and the

reinforcement of the organization's more general commitment?  To

see a supervisor fill out a compliance report italicizes

compliance in the workers' mind.  To see the executives visibly

following some systems and rules reinforces the idea that

lawfulness is high among the corporate values.  So, for example,

having a "hotline" may never disclose an interruptible

crime-in-process.  But having a hotline does say something to the

work force that mere words don't.<p>



If this is true, then what it says is that the "system" ought to

speak at least as well as it works; and that, because what it

expresses is at least as important as what it does, it need never

be so contrived or rigid as to interfere with anything else.<p>



Could that be what the Sentencing Commission was after?<p>

<H3>Seminar Discussion Thread</h3><p>



From: Louis Brown -- Sanders Barnet - Los Angeles<br>

Date:  Mon Nov  6 18:34<br>

Subject:  small-medium business<p>



There has been some concern - and rightly so - about the ability

of small/medium business to set up Compliance Review... A

management feature to set in motion is to have as much of the work

done by non-lawyers as is feasible.... Doing it that way does not

eliminate lawyers... In a sense such a methodology follows the

approach that Woody Mosten espouses (See Wall Street Journal

article on page B3, Lawyers and Clients... today, November 6,

1995). Any comments?<p>

From: Aileen R. Leventon -- Atty-Leventon, A. - New York<br>

Date:  Mon Nov  6 21:49<br>

Subject:  Measuring Costs<p>



I am interested in locating studies on the dollar costs of

compliance programs.  For example, how many people are assigned to

compliance functions?  Who defines themselves in the organization as

being a part of the compliance function?  (The compliance

department?  Members of the legal department? Human resources

staff who do training?)  What are the outside counsel and

consultants' expenses for designing, implementing and monitoring

programs? Our discussion thus far has centered on litigation

expense for compliance failures, and compliance with regulation.

What about the costs of an infrastructure for an effective

compliance program?  If anyone is aware of efforts in this area,

including a description of the proactive and laudable work of the

US Sentencing Commission, it would be helpful!  Thanks.<p>

This suggestion does not directly answer your fine inquiry. It

may, however, stimulate further discussion.<p>



I early suggested that corporations set up a line <I>budget</i> item for

compliance review. If any corporations have done this, the

experience will help answer the inquiry.

If you have set up a line <I>budget</i> for compliance review (or for

legal audit), what is your experience?<p>

Subject: Budget Components<p>



What are the components of a line budget for compliance review?

Does it cover preventive law assessments?  Does it cover drafting

the policy statements?  Review of applicable law?  Communications

and training?  Do all of those activities necessarily fall within

the ambit of the legal department or compliance department?  Does

it pick up [Human Resources] and Communications departments too? 

I'd love to hear about others' experience!!<p>

Subject: Budget a Law reason<p>



One of my thoughts in suggesting a budget line item concerns

proof, if needed, of the extent of the compliance review process

in an enterprise...The FSGs remind us that a Compliance Review in

place reduces, or might reduce, a criminal sentence.  The problem

then becomes proof of the Compliance Review process. It seems to

me that evidence (if it can be introduced) of the amount expended

for Compliance Review, and its components should help the

defendant...<p>



It is my understanding that when a corporation has a line item in

its budget, the normal practice is to keep a record of the

expenditures within that budget.<p>



All this does not, of course, answer the question of what goes

into the components...For the present, until a standard practice

is established, I assume that each corporation may set its own

components.  Yes, I would include preventive law activities within

that sort of budget. ....(Someday, I hope in the not too distant

future, NCPL will endeavor to arrange a training program for Legal

Audit, - including Compliance Review, and the rest of  Preventive

Law . <STRONG>Big Subject</strong>.)<p>Louis M. Brown<p><hr><p>

Subject: Measuring Costs<p>





I wish I could offer you detailed numbers but during the


establishment of our program, no one was keeping time.  Let me


say, however, that none of our program was developed through the


use of outside resources -- lawyers or consultants.  We went about


it by setting up a task force of in-house experts under a team of


line managers representative of key areas around our company.


Then, for two months, we conducted reviews with these people along


subcommittee lines focused on each of the seven criteria in the


FSG's.  Our task was to see what the company was already doing or


had in place and to determine what we needed to do to beef it up


-- if anything -- to meet the expectations of the FSG's.<p>





Then recommendations were made to the Manager Committee, which


quality controlled the process.  Once they were happy, it went up


to the officers and then the Board for adoption.<p>





This way, we "reengineered" what we had and redirected it with


the FSG's in mind -- but the FSG's were not our only target.  We


were concerned in compliance at all levels -- criminal, civil,


contractual, ethics, etc.<p>





The groups involved in the compliance team included


representatives from Audit Services, Human resources, Corporate


Security, Law, Risk Management, Environmental Services,  Media


Relations and our nuclear power plant.  On average, these groups


met twice over this period for two to three hours each -- then the


results of the interviews were distributed in draft form for


further review by them.  So, I'd estimate each individual spent


around 10 to 20 hours over the two months on this -- except the


lawyers who were driving the process at the time.<p>





The reason I am going through this detail is to demonstrate to


you the fact that it needn't cost a fortune if you define the


process as being part of the accountabilities of certain groups in


the company and redirect them to include this effort in their


operations.  By reengineering, we were able to rationalize this.<p>





From there, we developed a written code of conduct pamphlet.  Ten


thousand were produced for about $2,000 in our in-house print


facility -- not including the time for graphic design and layout,


which was also done in-house (maybe 5 to 10 hours, tops).  On top


of that, we developed a four-minute video to introduce the program


to all employees (then, about 8,000) throughout the company.  Cost


was $1,400 -- again, using in-house AV resources.  When it was


rolled out, the video and the codes were given to each manager,


who in turn called a staff meeting to present the video, discuss


the program and its objectives (from a predetermined script that


the compliance team wrote, so that the message was consistent


throughout the company), and to align their teams on the issue


through a strategic planning effort that resulted in individual


reports to the compliance team.  There were several management


meetings and training sessions at the outset, but these were


undertaken within the normal work routine, so no added expense was


incurred.<p>





This all happened in three months beginning January, 1994.  By


summer, the departments had each been indoctrinated and our


concerns line and Law Department were regularly receiving calls


and requests for support -- indicating that the effort was being


addressed by the rank and file.  This was buttressed by the


quality of questions we were receiving.<p>





By the way, we had two existing concerns lines and staffs, so


there was no added start up cost there, either, to the program set


up.  Our concerns lines are nothing very fancy.  A staff, phone


lines and message machine.  I don't know what they are costing to


maintain, but again, they are part of existing resources -- not


new additions -- and so it's easy to rationalize them.<p>





I realize this doesn't address you question head on, but we did


not keep logs of cost.  I hope, that by demonstrating how we went


about it, you can see that it doesn't have to cost hundreds of


thousands of dollars to install and operate.    Of course, the


path taken depends on the culture of the organization and its


situation.  If it did not have a compliant culture to begin with,


chances are some of these incremental steps may have to be taken


from ground level.  Or larger, more complex organizations may


necessarily cost more to redirect and manage.<p>





If I can be of further help, please let me know.<p>

Subject: Budget Components<p>





Aileen,<p>





When the Sentencing Commission decided to have studies conducted


on what is being done in compliance, they had a group of advisors


offering suggestions on how to proceed.  I had the opportunity to


participate in that group.  One of the questions we considered was


the one you asked:  "What resources were spent in the compliance


program?"<p>





The advisory group convinced the Commission staff not to ask this


question, because the answers from different companies would not


be comparable.  For example, I could describe my company's program


in very low-cost terms, much in the way that Herb Zinn did.  But I


could just as fairly describe it as a highly resource intensive


program.  I believe that most if not all of the legal department


plays a role in compliance. Companies with internal auditing and


security functions could also include those. Any industrial


hygienists?  Environmental engineers?  Quality control people in


the food and pharmaceuticals industries? Risk management?  They


could all be added in.  We also get time from HR people, corporate


communications, and a group that issues corporate policies. Its a


bit like the story of the blind men and the elephant.  Of course,


the best program is one where managers throughout the business


take ownership and include compliance and ethics in their normal


management oversight.<p>





As for outside resources, most of our work was done in-house, but


incorporated much of what I have learned from networking with


others in compliance for years.  I believe there are a number of


companies that use outside firms to handle hotline calls and to


help in video productions.<p>





I know this response is not specific regarding numbers;  it is


not a question I could answer with one bottom-line figure.  I'll


be interested to see what others have to offer.<p>

<H3>Seminar Library File</h3>

<H1>Preventive Law Reporter, Winter 1993</H1>

<h5>Copyright&#169;1993 Preventive Law Reporter</h5>

<H4>By HERBERT I. ZINN, Esq.</h4><EM>EDITOR'S NOTE: This article is excerpted from the Arizona 

Compliance Manual, published by Maricopa County Bar Association, 

Phoenix, Arizona. The excerpted portion focuses solely on the 

steps necessary in developing and preparing a compliance program 

and has been modified to some extent due to space limitations.<P>HERBERT I. ZINN has been a Senior Attorney with Arizona

Public Service for fourteen years.</em><p><H3>INTRODUCTION</h3>A thorough understanding of the Guidelines is a necessary

tool in the implementation of a compliance program, but there

is an even more important ingredient -- and that is having a

thorough understanding of the organization for which you are

designing the program. Without a sensitivity for the organization's

culture, the program, no matter how well it meets the criteria set

out in the Guidelines, will miss the mark in terms of effectiveness. 

The perspectives presented in this article are meant to

focus the implementation effort in such a way to allow program

designers to tailor the perspecaves to meet the strengths and

weaknesses of the organization. Needless to say, the considerations 

expressed in the discussion which follows need to be

thoroughly evaluated by the designers as they set about to build

the program for the organization.<p>



<H3>GETTING STARTED</h3>



<Strong><EM>Strategic Planning: Blueprint the Plan</strong></EM><p>



Assuming you have gained management's support for the

implementation of a compliance program, the next step is

strategic planning. A blueprint for implementation must be

drawn up, premised on management's vision, came frames, and

contingencies for unforeseen events that may impede the

smooth flow of the project.<p>



<Strong><EM>The Business Case Approach</strong></EM><p>



It is both fundamental and useful to develop a program

document at this point. For the purposes of this discussion, we

call it a Business Case. A Business Case is simply a detailed plan

of action that outlines the process. The Business Case will serve

as a valuable checklist for the implementation process, and is

also a good way to communicate roles and responsibilities

among the individuals assigned to develop the plan. But more

importantly, it will help flesh out latent issues that, if not

recognized up-front, may slow or even defeat the process.<p>



Who should be involved in the development of the Business

Case? Clearly, legal counsel plays an important role. Additionally, 

the development team should include an individual with

extensive knowledge of the organization, and, where applicable, 

a member of the audit staff to ferret out issues and develop

recommendations for their handling. Other professionals and

disciplines to consider are representatives from Human Resources, 

Security, and Risk Management.<p>



<Strong><EM>Scope and Objectives</strong></EM><p>



The Business Case should start with a concise statement of

management's vision -- its scope and objectives, i.e., what is the

desired outcome? The vision statement should be consistent

with the direction taken by the organization's governing body,

and be clear and understandable to each employee and agent

of the organization. The vision statement should be written in

terms that can be verbally tracked in the program document

itself. How should the vision be stated? It can be as simple as

this:<p>



<H5>It is the policy of ABC Company to comply with all

laws which apply to its business and activities, and to

conduct its affairs in a way that is both ethical and

responsible. Employees and agents of the Company

are expected to at all times discharge their dues in

full compliance with this policy.</h5>



The drafters of the statement may wish to elaborate upon the

meaning management imparts to these words, to help guide

those responsible for bringing the program into existence. The

organization should also consider how the program applies to

any of the organization's subsidiaries. Will the subsidiaries be

required to abide by the organization's program or develop their

own?<p>



Those responsible for developing the organization's vision

statement, should keep this consideration in mind: is the

organization developing the program so it will merely gain a

three point reduction in its culpability score under the Guidelines? 

Or does the organization want a program capable of

deterring criminal conduct before it occurs -- a program capable

of convincing a prosecutor that there is no purpose in initiating

criminal proceedings against the organization? At this point in

the discussion, there should be little doubt which path the

drafter wants the organization to follow.<p>



<Strong><EM>Resources</strong></EM><p>



Next, the Business Case should address the resources needed to

develop the program and bring it into operation. It is appropriate

here to describe the program in terms of its component parts

with reference to the Guidelines' requirements. The organization

may decide to surpass the Guidelines' requirements in all or

certain aspects of the program, depending upon the character and

needs of the organization and the risks it confronts.<p>



Among the resources the organization should address are the

skills and talent needed to make the program work (e.g., legal,

security, auditing, training); the existence of these skills and

talents in-house; the degree to which they will have to be

obtained through outside support (e.g., legal counsel, consultants, 

and vendors); the new elements needed to support the

program once it is up and running (e.g., an employee concerns

needed to develop the program and to maintain its effectiveness.<p>



<Strong><EM>Task Plans</strong></EM><p>



The next section of the Business Case -- Task Plans -- provides

a good opportunity for the designer to lay out a step-by-step

progression for construction of the compliance program. Here,

the building blocks that go into the program are laid out and

allocated to those in the organization who will have a hand in

the programs development and operation.<p>



Some questions that need to be addressed in developing the

task plan include: who will identify the laws with which the

organization is concerned in terms of compliance? Who will

determine and set the compliance standards employees and

agents will follow in discharging their responsibilities to the

organization? Who in the organization will be designated the

high-level person with responsibility for overseeing the compliance 

program -- and who will make the selection? What new

training programs need to be implemented? How will a system

be developed to assure that employees can communicate their

concerns without fear of retaliation for having done so? What

procedures are in place or will be needed to deal with incidents

of noncompliance when they are discovered? What mechanisms

will be needed to perform regular quality control on the program

to determine that it is working, to implement changes as

necessary, and to keep abreast of prevailing requirements that

may be set by the Guidelines as they evolve? The combinations

of issues and tasks are seemingly endless and necessarily vary

with the nature of the organization.<p>



<Strong><EM>Deliverables</strong></EM><p>



Next, the organization should address the precise deliverables

it expects from this effort. This is another way to focus the

attention of the task teams on what they are expected to

produce. Chief among them will be the compliance program document

itself--a document that meets the expectations of the Guidelines

and is effective in terms of its capability to deter, discover,

and deal with problems that may arise. Subsidiary to this are

the various components that contribute to the program's makeup:<p>

&iuml; a written schedule of compliance standards corresponding 

to the legal obligations imposed upon the organization, presented 

as a whole, or by operating area of the organization, depending 

upon its culture and needs;<p>&iuml; written procedures that prescribe the organization's

rules for legal compliance, what is to be done when

there is uncertainty about one's obligations, and

organizational responsibilities for supporting legal

compliance, e.g., line management's role in carrying

out policy, when to consult the lawyers, etc.;<p>&iuml; a communications and training program to assure

employees and agents are not only familiar with what

is expected of them but also know how to achieve

the desired ends;<p>&iuml; a phone-in hot-line and a staff to man it along with

detailed standards and procedures about the hot-line

capable of communicating to the workforce how it is

to be properly used;<p>&iuml; an audit program designed to monitor the

organization's compliance with applicable laws and

to report incidents of noncompliance;<p>&iuml; a mechanism or program of follow-up that assures

that problems are promptly and decisively addressed

and corrected; a set of procedures for the organization 

to follow in the event a problem is encountered,

e.g., reporting the incident to the regulatory authorities;<p>&iuml; a quality control program that regularly identifies

shortcomings in the program and plans for their

correction; and<p>&iuml; a clear and concise policy on discipline for those who

fail to comply with the organization's program -- as a

means of deterring noncompliance in the first instance, 

and dealing with that which may eventually

occur despite the program.<p>As in the case of Task Plans, the combinations are endless

depending upon the nature of the organization.<p><Strong><EM>Prerequisites</strong></EM><p>The Prerequisites section of the Business Case focuses

management's attention on what is required to make the process

work. The first prerequisite should be a clear, consistent, and

visible statement by management indicating its commitment to

and support for the process of developing and operating the

compliance program. In the view of the author, without clear

and ever present management commitment, the vitality of the

program and the employees' willingness to incorporate its

expectations into their work habits will have little chance

for lasting success.<p>The Prerequisites section should also identify where consents

to specific actions may be needed. For instance, an aspect of the

proposed plan may conflict with the terms of a license or permit

or other commitment to a regulatory authority, requiring that the

organization discuss this with the regulatory authority or alter its

plan to avoid the conflict.<p><Strong><EM>Major Drivers</strong></EM><p>Under Major Drivers, the organization should identify the

reasons why the program is being undertaken:<p>&iuml; the organization's commitment to its investors, its

customers, its employees, and the communities in

which it resides or serves;<p>&iuml; improved image of the organization; management of

the risks attendant to noncompliance with applicable

laws; and<p>&iuml; the laws themselves and, of course, the Sentencing

Guidelines.<p>This will help in graphically reminding the managing body of

the organization why this effort is being undertaken.<p><Strong><EM>Cost</strong></EM><p>Last, but certainly not least, is the section on cost. Best

estimates should be used here with contributions from all staff

involved in developing the program. The organization should

separately list in-house and outside resources.<p><H3>ORGANIZING A TEAM</h3>Once the plan for developing and implementing a compliance 

plan is approved by the organization's managing body, it

is time to staff the project. The planning document should have

identified the staffing needs in terms of resources, and delegated

to the staff discrete tasks to perform in the implementation

process. This discussion explores in more detail the specific role

played by each of the disciplines that make up the implementation team.<p>

<Strong><EM>Management</strong></EM><p>Management's role doesn't end with the approval of the plan

of implementation. If the effort has any hope of long term

success, management must be a visible, active participant

throughout the process. No one in the organization will take

seriously the commitment to compliance if that commitment is

not graphically demonstrated through management's active

participation in the effort.<p>Line management and employees may view the project as one

that conflicts with their already overburdened schedules. Unless

upper management is present to reinforce the importance of the

project, there will be a natural tendency to put it on the back

bummer. Not only is this conclusion reached through common

sense, the Sentencing Guidelines themselves envision high-level

management as a key player in the process of developing and

maintaining the plan. The second criterion for a compliance plan

under the Guidelines dictates that a high-level person or persons

in the organization be given responsibility for overseeing the

plan. United States Sentencing Guidelines, Sec. 8A1.2 cmt. n.3(k)(2).<p>

<Strong><EM>Lawyers</strong></EM><p>Their role in the process is obvious, but worth outlining

nonetheless. Legal support is required from the very outset of

the process:<p>&iuml; to dissect the Sentencing Guidelines so their requirements 

and expectations are understood;<p>&iuml; to participate in the conduct of legal audits needed

to determine where, and to what extent, the organization 

needs to address the crimes that are subject to

the Guidelines -- as well as other requirements of

federal, state, and local law that should be addressed

while the organization is engaged in this effort;<p>&iuml; to draft the compliance standards together with

representatives of the organization's operating areas.

The objective here is that the standards meet both the

requirements of the Guidelines as well as the requirement 

that they be concise, easily understood, and

uncomplicated enough to be meaningful to those

individuals who have to rely upon them for guidance;<p>&iuml; to develop support programs required by the Guidelines, 

such as the employees' concerns line, communications and 

training programs, monitoring audits,

and reporting procedures.<p>To accomplish the task and make it real and meaningful, the

lawyers assigned to the process should have experience in

regulatory compliance, employment matters, criminal law as it

applies to white collar crime and organizational conduct, and,

above all, a thorough understanding of the organization. The

lawyers will not function by themselves; rather, they will be

assigned to support the efforts of the other team members.<p>

<Strong><EM>Auditors</strong></EM><p>Traditionally, audit staff is important because of its understanding 

of ethical behavior and systems of internal controls.

Its assigned task in the organization is to participate in the

development of the code of conduct and systems of internal

controls designed to detect departures from prescribed standards 

of care. Hence, their importance in the compliance plan

process is critical.<p>The audit staff can be of enormous value in bringing together

principles of business ethics and industry custom, which form

a good staring point for the organization's effort. Moreover, the

audit function plays a key role in the operation of the plan as it

goes forward. The audit staff can man the employee concerns

line, as well as develop audit programs to monitor the

organization's compliance.<p><Strong><EM>Human Resources</strong></em><p>As the process of plan implementation moves along, Human

Resources personnel ("HR") will need to become involved. The

roots of the program will be anchored in the organization's

work force. Someone with an understanding of, and responsibility

for, the behavioral health of the workforce should therefore

assist in designing the program.<p>HR's role is to ferret out conflicts in the process that could

frustrate the plan or other existing programs of the organization.

The organization can anticipate that the plan may call upon

employees to do something contrary to a prevailing labor

agreement, call for an amendment to other company policies, or

somehow conflict with employee rights or prevailing employment laws. 

The fundamental task of assuring consistency within

the organization will go to the HR staff.<p>HR will also be assigned the task of developing clear, concise

communication material about the program for circulation throughout 

the workforce. Last, HR's role includes developing training

programs -- in concert with other operating groups in the organization 

that will inform the workforce of the organization's

expectations and how to satisfy those expectations.<p><Strong><EM>Security</strong></EM><p>During the process of implementation, the issue of background 

checks will need to be addressed. See United States

Sentencing Guidelines, Sec. 8A1.2 cmt. n.3(k)(3). Security

personnel are ideal for this purpose, as they possess an

understanding of the methods used to investigate personnel

histories. Security personnel will also be invaluable in

developing investigative procedures -- along with the lawyers

and the audit staff -- necessary to deal with an event of

noncompliance.<p><Strong><EM>Risk Management</strong></EM><p>Traditionally, this group is thought of as the organization that

buys the insurance needed to deal with anticipated risks; but

they also possess a keen understanding of the organization's

workings, and are trained to spot processes that may enhance

the probability of a risk's occurrence. Characterized in this way,

the Risk Management group is a very useful supporting resource

for the process of plan design and implementation.<p>

<Strong><EM>The Workforce</strong></EM><p>The majority of the organization's employees will not be

directly involved in the design and implementation of the

program. They are, however, as important as those groups

discussed above. The success of the plan relies on the

willingness of employees to accord it the respect it deserves.

Without commitment from the workforce, the plan will never

succeed. A recent example illustrates this point.<p>In the winter of 1992, a devastating explosion shook the South

Mountain Mine in Wise County, Virginia. Seven miners were

killed. Subsequent investigations disclosed that the miners may

have purposely blocked the orifices on methane gas detection

devices. Federal and state mining law required the presence

and use of this methane detection equipment -- so did company

procedures. Nevertheless, the miners neutralized the equipment.

The reason why may never be known, but it provides good fuel

for speculation.<p>One reason may be that the miners never bought into the

requirements, even though the requirements were designed to

protect them. This exemplifies why it is important to gain

employee buy-in on requirements such as legal compliance.

Unless the requirements are made part of the organization's

culture, there will always be members of the workforce willing

to short circuit the process, thus, exposing the employees and the

organization to the consequences.<p>All employees, therefore, need to be involved from the very

beginning of the process. The employees need to know that

management is committed to the program -- that the program

is designed for their protection, as well as that of the organization. 

They also need to know and understand their role in

making it work. This requires that they understand the personal

consequences if the process doesn't work through some act or

omission on their part.<p><H3>SETTING UP THE PROGRAM</h3><Strong><EM>A Necessary First Step</strong></EM><p>The entry point for program implementation is the announcement 

of the process to the employees of the organization. The

organization should also make announcements to its agents, as,

under the Guidelines, the organization is also vicariously liable

for their acts.<p>Announcements at the beginning are important and preferable for

several reasons. First, it is management's first opportunity to

communicate its commitment to the process. Management has the

opportunity here to describe the process, why it is being

undertaken, the expected outcomes, benefits, costs, and

sacrifices. Moreover, management will have the opportunity to

explain up front the system of accountability, expectations, and

responsibilities imposed on all employees by the process.<p>Second, management will have the opportunity to deal with

and mitigate at the outset the potentially destructive effects of

the organization's grapevine. Every organization has one and it

is important to acknowledge it and the influence it may have on

the success of program implementation. Some employees will

have already heard about the Guidelines through snippets of

information they read in industry journals. Relying on this

information, many may form the wrong impression based upon

the emphasis placed upon the Guidelines by the media, e.g., it

is a way to send people to jail and so scapegoats will abound.<p>Other employees may wonder why their organization is not

doing something about the Guidelines; misconstruing silence as

a sign of management's ineptness or utter disregard for an

important issue, thereby undermining confidence. An early

announcement, before the program is even designed, will

demonstrate the importance and commitment placed by managent 

on the process.<p>Third, by announcing management's intentions up front, an

opportunity is created to gain employee buy-in through 

empowerment. The announcement should not merely be a one way

communication to the employment body. The organization

should ask its employees to think about how they perform their

jobs and to communicate their concerns for the program to the

implementation team. Management's willingness to incorporate

employee input, and to consider employee concerns can make a

big difference in the chances for the program's success.

Employee involvement is a fundamental step in encouraging

employee buy-in.<p>After the initial announcement, line management should discuss

the process as part of the staff meetings they hold with their

departments. The dialogue should continue throughout the

process of implementing the program so the importance of the

effort remains paramount.<p>

The team assigned the task of implementing the program should

also make a speclal point of visiting those areas of the

organization whose participation in the process is fundamental. For instance, in order for the managers of specific operating

plants to understand and communicate their concerns regarding

the program, they must be involved early on in the process. In

turn, the task team should consider management's concerns and

change their plans, when appropriate, to accommodate them.<p>

Throughout the implementation process, management should

send out communications to the work force -- either directly or

through line management -- giving brief status reports on how

the process is progressing. Keeping the process in the mind of

the workforce is another way to demonstrate the emphasis

management places on compliance. The HR staff should be

assigned the task of developing these communications in

conjunction with the lawyers assigned to them.<p>

<Strong><EM>Setting Up Compliance Standards</strong></EM><p>

"The organization must have established compliance standards 

and procedures to be followed by its employees and other

agents that are reasonably capable of reducing the prospect of

criminal conduct." United States Sentencing Guidelines, Section

8A1.2 emt n.3(k)(1).<p>

The implementation task team's first assignment is to develop

clear, concise compliance standards that are relevant to the

operation of the organization. Section 8C2.1 of the Sentencing

Guidelines enumerates the crimes subject to the finer provisions

embodied in the Guidelines. Chapter Two of the Guidelines

contains many others. Many of the crimes, however, will not

pertain to the activities of the organization. For instance, if

the organization is not a publicly-held corporation, the crimes

relating to insider trading will have no impact. So why address

them?<p>The implementation task team, therefore, needs to review the

applicable crimes described in Section 8C2.1 and Chapter Two

against the organization and its activities to determine the high,

medium, and low risk items. The attorneys, along with the

assigned representaaves from the operating areas, can perform

this task when conducting a legal audit. Attorneys familiar with

the legal requirements attendant to the crimes identified in

section 8C2.1 and Chapter Two should meet with the operating

areas to determine if, how, and to what extent the organization's

activities could interrelate with the crime. In this way, a risk

assessment is performed and a meaningful compliance standard

for crimes relevant to the organization is developed.<p>

To this point, we have talked solely in terms of the crimes

enumerated under the Guidelines. It is a good idea not to limit

the scope of the effort to the Guidelines' crimes. Recall that

not all federal crimes are included in Section 8C2.1, nor are

State and local offenses, or items that comprise civil violations

of laws and regulatory requirements. It is of questionable sense

to develop a compliance plan that only deals with federal criminal 

issues where there may be other equally significant compliance

considerations not applicable under Section 8C2.1 of the Guidelines.

While the task team is addressing the Guidelines, it should

also address the issue of organizational compliance with all risk

areas. This may lengthen the process, but in terms of efficiency

and dollars, it makes sense. One way to address this is to

perform the project in phases, with the Guidelines and other

high risk areas given priority.<p>

There exists no set pattern describing how these compliance

standards should be set down. Some plans approach the issue

by discussions in broad terms. The organization's structure may

not be complex enough to warrant in-depth discussion. It may

suffice merely to state that it is organization's policy to comply

with all laws applicable to the organization's activities. Although

one cannot totally fault this approach, most organizations will

need to develop a more detailed plan to demonstrate the

organization's commitment and to make the compliance standards 

meaningful and understandable.<p>

Whether the details appear in the plan document or in

operating procedures referenced in the plan document is a

matter of choice. What is important is that a clear statement of

proper conduct is communicated to the workforce. This

statement will act as a starting point for supporting training

programs and, where need be, as the basis for disciplinary action

in the event of noncompliance.<p>

In an optimum sense, the more detailed the better. The

organization, however, must take care to ensure complex

compliance requirements are easily understood by those who

must use and adhere to them. An example illustrates this point.

Let's say Widget Co. manufactures Widgets at its factory. The

plant is situated next to a river, and plant processes require water

to cool plant machinery. Therefore, Widget Co.'s plant consumes 

water from the river, circulates it through plant machinery, 

and then redeposits it in the river. To do this, Widget Co.'s

environmental department has filed for and obtained a permit

to use and discharge the river water. The permit is issued under

the Federal Clean Water Act and prescribes detailed operating

limits imposed on Widget Co.'s plant.<p>

Under this set of circurnstances, is it enough for the compliance 

plan to provide that Widget Co. will comply with applicable law? 

Although a good starting point, how does the plan

ensure the objectives of both Widget Co. and the Clean Water

Act are met? Something more is needed. Understanding this is

important at the beginning. Management will be understandably

concerned if the task team proposes a compliance program

document that is several volumes thick -- and thereby slated to

sit on a shelf gathering dust.<p>

Therefore, in developing the compliance document, the task

team needs to address the nature of the deliverable they are

creaang. There are a variety of opaons: a short concise

document expressing the organization's intent; something more

detailed; or a mix of the two--meaning a concise declaration

of the organization's policy, cross-referencing into detailed

operaang instrucaons established and rnaintained in compliance 

with the plan at the operational level. For example, Widget

Co.'s compliance document might look something like this:<p>

&iuml; A brief policy statement issued by management,

declaring the organization's intenaon to comply with

the expectations of applicable law, and including a

discussion of the reason why this is important to the

organization, what areas of the law are related to the

organization's operations; a statement of the responsibilities 

placed upon employees and agents to satisfy

this declaration of the organization's policy; and a

statement indicaang the consequences to the employee 

or agent who fails to abide by the standards.

Finally, the document should direct the user to consult

with operating procedures.<p>

&iuml;Detailed and precise operating procedures keyed into

the compliance program that delineate the way in

which employees are expected to comply with applicable laws. 

These are developed at the operating level

between representaaves of each unit and attorneys

assigned to them who are familiar with the applicable

legal requirements. Not only would these protocols

address what the law says, but how the law applies to

the organization. For instance, in terms of permits

issued to the organization under authority of the law.<p>

Applied to Widget Co., this format presents a more meaningful 

approach. At the very top of the organization is Widget Co.'s

declaration of its intention to comply with the law; thereby

establishing each employee's responsibility. Beneath, is a

specific instruction designed and implemented for the Widget

Co. plant. The instructions highlight limitations imposed on the

plant by law and by the permit, and address plant parameters for

operating within those tolerances. Widget Co.'s employees

know what is expected of them and how to satisfy those

expectations.

Plant management, with HR support, can develop routine

training programs to keep employees aware of the way they are

to perform their jobs. There is established a defined basis for

monitoring the operations of the plant to assure compliant

acaviaes; and, should the need arise, there is a definite basis to

reprimand and discipline employees who fail to follow the

prescribed procedure.<p>

In preparing the compliance standards, management may

express concern about the natural propensity of people to go

ahead and do things not expressly proscribed by the terms of the

compliance standards. Everyone seems to have a little lawyer

in them. Employees seem to look for opportunities to test or

hone their skills by searching out loopholes in established

policies. There can never be a guaranty that a well described

standard will be ironclad. Someone will perceive a hole in it

somewhere. Therefore the answer to this concern lies in a

combination of remedies:<p>

&iuml; the standard should be carefully drafted in a way that

makes its objectives understandable hereby conveying 

the spirit of the objectives to the employee;<p>

&iuml; once it is written, it should be reviewed by others

with differing perspectives who may see consequences

not apparent to the draftsman;<p>

&iuml; the compliance plan should make it clear that the

rules set forth are not all-encompassing, and employees 

are expected to use good sense and judgement

in performing their jobs. If there is a question of what

is right, they should consult with their management;<p>

&iuml; the compliance standards should be underwritten by a comprehensive training program that exemplifies

management's objectives so there can be little room

to doubt what is expected by the standards.<p><H3>CONCLUSION</h3>You may not agree that a programmatic approach is needed

in order to begin the process of developing a compliance plan.

Assuredly, the Business Case approach is not the end-all option.

What it does symbolize, however, is the need to put pencil to

paper before running off to set up a compliance program.

<h5>Copyright&#169;1995 Preventive Law Reporter</h5>

<H4>By RICHARD S. GRUNER</h4>

<H5>Professor of Law, <A HREF="http://www.whittier.edu/www/lawhome.html">Whittier College School of Law</a><br>

Los Angeles, California</H5>



<EM>RICHARD GRUNER is a former inside counsel to the IBM

Corporation and consultant to the U.S. Sentencing Commission

concerning corporate sentencing standards.</em><p>



Legal compliance programs involve systematic efforts by

corporations to detect and prevent offenses by corporate

employees and other agents. These programs identify,

facilitate and encourage lawful conduct by corporate employees, 

as well as monitor legal compliance results. Compliance

programs can further corporate interests in many ways, including 

reducing the frequency of illegal conduct1 influencing

prosecutorial discretion to withhold corporate charges for

employee offenses, minimizing corporate penalties for com-

pleted offenses, satisfying demands by board members and

others for information on corporate legal compliance and

implementing ethical norms in business operations. Compliance

programs can also avoid civil liabilities, strengthen civil claims

and enhance corporate reputations among customers, suppliers, 

employees and communities.<p>



Developing standards for corporate officer and director

liability recognize compliance programs as central concerns in

corporate governance systems. Under the American Law Institute's

1994 <EM>Principles of Corporate Governance (Principles)</em>, the failure

of corporate officers and directors to institute and periodically

assess compliance systems in corporate organizations can form

the basis for personal liability of the officers and directors.

This liability would be in the amount of corporate losses

(including fines and punitive damages) suffered in a situation

where an effective program would likely have prevented the losses.

An examination follows of these liability standards and the types

of compliance systems that will shield officers and directors from

this potentially large type of liability.<p>





<H3>CORPORATE LEGAL COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS</h3>



As a legally recognized actor with many of the powers of an

individual, the Principles recognize that a corporation "[i]s

obligated, to the same extent as a natural person, to act within

the boundaries set by law." <EM>Principles</em>, Sec. 2.01(b)(1). 

Top corporate managers must direct corporate activities within these

boundaries. Sec. 4.01(a) (Comment d).<p>



Beyond an obligation not to knowingly cause corporate

employees to violate the law, corporate directors and officers

also have affirmative duties to establish effective compliance

sterns to ensure that firm activities are generally conducted

lawfully and that illegal aberrations in corporate operations are

detected and stopped. Sec. 4.01(a)(1)-(a)(2)(Comment c). While

legal compliance in day-to-day corporate operations need not

be overseen directly by corporate directors and officers, monitoring 

duties concerning legal compliance must be responsibly

delegated. Directors and officers must react affirmatively once

they receive evidence that company compliance programs are

not operating properly. Sec. 4.01(b)(Comment b).<p>



<H3>MANAGERIAL DUE DILIGENCE CONCERNING LEGAL COMPLIANCE</h3>



<Strong><EM>Measuring Due Diligence</em></strong><p>



A useful definition of due diligence in operating corporate

compliance programs can be developed from these standards.

Corporate directors and officers should be deemed to have

undertaken due diligence in good faith in conjunction with the

corporate activities initiated and maintained under their leadership. 

This will be the case if directors and officers institute

effective compliance measures which are sufficient to support

a good faith belief that corporate activities are being conducted

lawfully.<p>



Framed this way, due diligence concerning compliance

programs is sufficient action to support a reasonable belief that

corporate activities initiated and overseen by directors and

managers are being conducted "within the boundaries set by

law." This is another way of saying that officers and directors

must see that their firms have positive management programs

which, upon reasonable inquiry, appear to be adequate to

insure compliance in corporate operations.<p>



At the heart of every effective program is the recognition that

compliance, like other aspects of corporate performance, is

ultimately a responsibility of the corporate line managers who

control day-to-day business operations. The essential objectives

of a compliance program are to insure that line managers give

attention to compliance matters in their oversight of corporate

operations and that compliance efforts are integrated with other

day-to-day management practices and procedures.<p>



<Strong><EM>Standards for Officer and Director Liability</strong></em><p>



Corporate officers and directors risk personal liability for

inadequate compliance systems based on these individuals' lack

of due care in instituting and monitoring such systems. Under

the Principles, suits claiming damages on this ground may be

governed by three types of standards:<p>



<Strong><EM>Business Judgment Rule</strong></em><p>



Where individual directors or officers evaluate the need for a

compliance system and make an affirmative decision about the

appropriate scope of such systems (even if this decision is to

adopt few if any compliance mechanisms), these actions will

generally be protected under the "business judgment rule."

Under this rule, if directors or officers have undertaken

reasonable fact gathering and evaluation prior to making a

decision about the scope and adequacy of a compliance system,

that decision will not be a basis for personal liability of the

directors or officers unless the decision is irrational.

Sec. 4.01(c).<p>



<Strong><EM>Simple Negligence</strong></em><p>



Where directors or officers have not affirmatively addressed

compliance systems, they will not gain the protection of the

business judgment rule. Instead, their inaction in implementing

these systems will be evaluated under a simple negligence

standard. If an ordinarily prudent person would have implemented 

preventive compliance systems in a like position and

under similar circumstances, directors and officers who fail to

adopt such systems will be found to have breached their duty

of care. Sec. 4.01(a).<p>



<Strong><EM>Affirmative Duty to Act</strong></em><p>



If particular officers or directors have specific information

indicating the inadequacy of present compliance mechanisms

(for example, knowledge that existing systems failed to detect

a recent offense or failed to respond correctly once such an

offense was detected), and the officers and directors do not react

by making an inquiry and seeking to improve the compliance

systems, these corporate leaders may face personal liability for

their negligent reaction to manifest compliance system failures.

Officers' and directors' duties of care include "the obligation to

make, or cause to be made, any inquiry when, but only when,

the circumstances would alert a reasonable director or officer to

the need therefor. The extent of such inquiry shall be such as the

director or officer reasonably believes to be necessary."

Sec. 4.01(a)(1).<p>



This rule establishes a special negligence test that avoids a

general duty to inquire about corporate misconduct, but which

compels action once an officer or director gains special knowledge 

suggesting misconduct on the part of corporate employees

that could be stopped or prevented by improved compliance

practices. In essence, this rule enforces a corporate counterpart

to the old adage "every dog gets one bite." Obviously, corporate

insiders with greater information about compliance problems

and system failures will tend to face liability under this standard

more often than outside directors with fewer corporate contacts

and lesser knowledge about operating conditions.<p>



Under each of these three standards, a breach of duty by

directors or officers must be linked to a corporate loss in order

to produce liability. That is, it must be shown that the lack of a

compliance system was a legal cause of corporate losses due to

criminal activity or other misconduct that might otherwise have

been detected and stopped through more substantial compliance

efforts. Under the Principles, an officer or director who breaches

his or her duty of care is liable for corporate losses legally

caused by the breach. A breach of duty is the legal cause of

losses if (i) compliance with the duty of care would have been

foreseeable to an ordinarily prudent person in a like position to

that of the defendant and in similar circumstances. It is not a

defense to liability in these cases that damage to the corporation

would not have resulted but for the acts or omissions of other

individuals such as the individual offenders whose misconduct

caused the corporate losses. Sections 7.18(a) & (b) (1994).<p>



<Strong><EM>Derivative Rights of Shareholders</strong></em><p>



Liability for the failure to institute and maintain an adequate

compliance program can be asserted in the name of a corporation 

through a derivative suit initiated by a corporate shareholder. 

Sec. 7.01-.17. If successful, this type of suit will

result in the personal liability of a director or officer in the

amount of the corporate losses that might have been prevented

through more substantial compliance efforts. Section7.18(a).<p>



Because these suits typically will not assert knowing or illegal

misconduct by corporate directors or officers (since the liability

of these parties is premised on their lack of due care in

establishing preventive programs rather than on direct participation 

in the illegal conduct leading to corporate losses), the

personal liability of officers and directors based on inadequate

provisions for compliance programs may be subject to indemnification 

or insurance reimbursements. Under the <EM>Principles</em>,

indemnification of corporate officials or directors found liable to

their corporation would only be possible under court order and

only where a court determines that such indemnification is fair

and reasonable. Sec. 7.20(b)(1)(D), (c)(2). A corporation may

purchase insurance for officers and directors with broader

coverage,but may not acquire insurance that would furnish such

parties with protection against liability for "conduct directly

involving a knowing and culpable violation of law or involving

a significant pecuniary benefit obtained by an insured person to

which the person is not legally entitled." Sec. 7.20(b)(2).<p>



<Strong><EM>Operational Features of Compliance Programs Reflecting Due Diligence</strong></em><p>



In order for officers or directors to justify a finding that

Corporate operations are generally being conducted lawfully, a

compliance program should have several features. In general,

an adequate program that supports confidence about corporate

compliance will be one that has the following characteristics:<p>



&iuml; Performance demands imposed by the system are well understood and 

generally met by corporate employees;<p>



&iuml; The performance required by the system is effective

in satisfying legal requirements; and<p>



&iuml; The system fosters an operational emphasis on

preventing legal offenses rather than on detecting

offenses after the fact.<p>



The scope of performance controls and monitoring that is

necessary to make a compliance program effective will depend

on the extent of corporate activities within a firm, the diversity

of those activities and the nature of the legal risks raised by

those activities. The more likely legal violations are in terms of

these factors, the more extensive a firm's compliance practices

should be in order for top managers and directors to be reasonably

assured that compliance is being maintained.<p>



Likewise, the more extensive the history of offenses is in a

particular firm or industry, the more extensive compliance

practices should be to maintain a reasonable certainty that

additional offenses of a similar sort are being prevented. Finally,

where a firm's activities threaten illegal conduct with particularly

harmful consequences (such as, for example, illegal waste

discharges by a chemical manufacturing firm that would threaten

a nearby town), the public dangers involved will require

expanded compliance efforts to achieve a reasonable certainty

of compliance. In such settings, the extreme public risks

associated with firm activities will raise the level of compliance

efforts necessary to achieve a reasonable certainty of legal

compliance.<p>



<H3>CONCLUSION</h3>



Legal compliance systems are increasingly considered by

sentencing courts and prosecutors evaluating substantiality of

corporate crime prevention efforts. Under the Principles, these

same systems have central importance in determining the

personal liability of corporate officers and directors for corporate 

losses stemming from illegal employee activities and other

misconduct that compliance programs can prevent or mitigate.<p>



Beyond their impact on corporate and personal liability for

completed employee offenses, corporate compliance programs

can be valuable means to prevent or stop such offenses. These

programs have important benefits whether viewed simply as

management tools for reducing offenses, as means to qualify for

favorable prosecutorial or sentencing treatment when offenses

occur or as means to shield corporate officers and directors from

potential personal liability. Managers who ignore compliance

programs are taking unnecessary chances with corporate assets

and futures.<p>



The development of compliance programs is a one-time

process that requires a comprehensive view of the legal standards 

governing firm operations and a sensitivity to the managerial 

techniques needed to direct, monitor and control compliance 

activities. By adopting careful measures to combat and

react to employee misconduct, firms can manage legal risks and

minimize corporate criminal and civil liability amidst increasingly 

complex legal requirements.

<H3>The U.S. Sentencing Commission Guidelines:<br>



<H4>By THOMAS B. LEARY</h4>

<H5>Partner, Hogan & Hartson, Washington, D.C.<br> 

For 11 years, Mr. Leary was General Motors Corp. assistant

general counsel in Detroit. He received an economics degree

at Princeton and his law degree from Harvard.</h5>



<EM>Editor's Note: The following article was written prior to the

passage of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations.

The actual guidelines thus differ in their detail from the

analysis presented below. We nonetheless wanted to include this

article in our library because it presents an excellent background

and interesting overview of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.</em><p>



The United States Sentencing Commission recently

submitted to Congress a set of guidelines for

comprehensive reform of the criminal penalties

that will be imposed on organizations, including corporaions, 

convicted of Federal crimes. These guidelines become

law on No. 1, 1991, unless Congress intervenes -- which is

highly unlikely. When this happens, the sanctions for a

wide range of corporate crimes will be far more inflexible,

and far more harsh, than anything that corporations have

experienced before.<p>



The commission was created by Congress in 1984, primarily 

because of a perception that there was an unfair

disparity in the jail sentences imposed on individuals in the

federal systems. The commission promptly proposed individual 

guidelines, designed to achieve greater uniformity,

and they became law in 1987. The commission then turned

its attention to corporate sentences, notwithstanding the

fact that there was no evidence of congressional concern

about disparity in this area and relatively little experience

to serve as a guide.<p>



The commission floated multiple drafts over a three-year

period, and received comments from literally hundreds of

companies and their trade associations, before it submitted

proposals to Congress this year. The final proposals are

complex and difficult to apply, but the overall thrust is

clear: corporate penalties will be much higher.<p>



To sentence a convicted company under the proposed

guideline scheme, the judge must perform some alternative

calculations and then apply the alternative that yields the

highest penalty. First, the judge is supposed to calculate a

"base fine" by reference to a "fine table." The fines in the

table range from $5,000 to $72,500,000, depending on the

nature of the offense. This is not the most serious threat

because generally most corporate offenses will be in the

lower range.<p>



The judge is also supposed to calculate an alternative

base fine, however, which is measured by the gain to the

corporation or the loss that is caused if the offense is

deliberate. The precise language is "to the extent the loss 

was caused intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly." The words 

sound restrictive, but in other areas of statutory interpretation 

they sometimes are not applied in a restrictive way. It is too 

early to tell whether sentencing judges will pay any attention to

these words of limitation when contemplating fines based

on the harm caused by a crime.<p>



There is no cap on this amount; base fines in the billions

are theoretically possible. The greater of these alternative

base fines is then subjected to a multiplier, of up to four

times, which varies according to the "Culpability Score" of

the defendant. This score depends on individual factors like

the criminal history of the company, if any, the involvement

of top management, and the degree of cooperation with the

prosecutor. All of these penalties are imposed on top of full

restitution for potential victims of the offense.<p>



Sentencing Commission Guidelines do provide for a

possible mitigation of severe penalties, however, if the

defendant corporation has "an effective program to prevent

and detect violations of law." The elements of an effective

program are also spelled out in the guidelines.<p>



The specific credit for compliance programs is consistent

with a basic concept, often articulated by the commission's

chairman, that the guidelines should offer a "carrot" and

a "stick" -- a carrot to reward corporations that intensify

their efforts to comply with the law and a stick to punish

severely those that do not.<p>



There is controversy about the extent to which the

guidelines really do meet the stated objective of rewarding

corporate compliance programs. This article explores the

issue in further detail. Whatever the shortcomings of the

guidelines in this regard, however, corporations have no

choice but to intensify their compliance efforts. We also

identify the specific elements of a compliance program as

set forth in the guidelines.<p>



As mentioned above, the guidelines provide that the base

fine is subjected to a multiplier, which varies according to

the "Culpabilily Score" of the defendant corporation. If

there are no aggravating or mitigating factors, the 

corporation's score will be 5 points, and the base fine multiplier

will range from 1x to 2x.<p>



A court's finding that there was "an effective program to

prevent and detect violations of law" will reduce the

culpability score from 5 to 2 (other things being equal), and

the new multiplier will range from 0.40x to 0.80x. In effect,

the fine range with a qualifying compliance program is

only 40 percent of the fine range without it.<p>



There are significant limitations on the compliance

credit, however. In the first place, a defendant cannot

qualify for it if "high-level" management of the company

or a unit of the company, or an individual with compliance

responsibilities, "participated in, condoned, or was willfully

ignorant of the offense."<p>



Participation of lower-management personnel with "substantial 

authority" creates a "rebuttable presumption" that

the defendant did not have an effective compliance program.

Even without a detailed discussion of the precise meaning

of these various terms, it is obvious that this first limitation

will bar compliance credit in many cases.<p>



Second, the compliance credit is available only if the

company reports "the offense to appropriate governmental

authorities" within a reasonable time after it has become

aware if it. In some areas of regulation the failure to report

is itself an offense and this limitation will not be significant.

In other areas it will be significant -- for example, if the

company is inhibited from reporting by the risk of civil

litigation.<p>



Because of these limitations, some people have argued

that compliance credits will not be available in many cases,

and that therefore companies need not concern themselves

with what the guidelines say about compliance programs.

The premise may be correct, but the conclusion is not. Next

we discuss the reasons why it is imperative for companies

to intensify their compliance efforts.<p>



Notwithstanding the difficulty of qualifying for com-

pliance credits under the guidelines, prudent companies

will intensify their compliance efforts for the following

reasons:<p>



<H4>&iuml; The Downside Risks Are Greater</h4>



The risks of criminal prosecution are escalating, even as

the penalties become more severe. Congress increasingly

authorizes criminal sanctions for violations of complex

regulations, and the Justice Department openly claims that

criminal fines are expected to make ever larger contributions

to federal revenues.<p>



The risks of exposure are compounded by the fact that

corporations are criminally responsible for the acts of their

employees, even though those employees may have acted

directly contrary to management instructions and may have

been principally motivated by the desire for personal gain.<p>



Moreover, some statutes provide for "strict" criminal

liability, which means that a company can be convicted for

violating a regulation even though the event was genuinely

an accident and no one, at any level, was even negligent.

The new regulatory crimes are not intuitively obvious, and

companies cannot simply rely on the good common sense

or moral discrimination of their employees.<p>



In these circumstances, it would make sense for companies

to intensify their compliance efforts even if the Sentencing

Guidelines did not provide any credit at all.<p>



<H4>&iuml; The Threat of Probation</h4>



The absence of a compliance program is not an aggravating 

circumstance by itself, but the guidelines instruct a

judge to impose probation "if, at the time of sentencing, an

organization having 50 or more employees does not have an

effective program to prevent and detect violations of law."<p>



If a company is put on probation for that shortcoming,

it will thereafter have to implement a compliance program

under judicial supervision. This involves potentially bur-

densome disclosure, reporting and monitoring obligations.

The court may even hire "experts," at the company's

expense, to investigate the company's ongoing compliance

efforts.<p>



In other words, a company that takes a chance and does

not attempt to implement a qualifying compliance program,

may have to implement one under court supervision if it

commits a crime. Judicial supervision is not likely if the

defendant has previously made good-faith compliance

efforts because "failure to prevent or detect the instant

offense, by itself, does not mean that the program was not

effective."<p>



<H4>&iuml; Possible Aggravating Factors</h4>



We have already mentioned that a company cannot get

credit for compliance efforts if top management people

were involved in the offense. Beyond that, however, this

involvement is also an aggravating factor which requires an

upward adjustment in the culpability score.<p>



For example, if a high-level person in a company (or

unit) with over 5,000 employees "participated in, condoned,

or was willfully ignorant of the offense," the score is

increased by 5 points. A par score of 5 would be increased

to 10, and the fine multipliers would be doubled.<p>



Individuals are "willfully ignorant" if they "did not

investigate the possible occurrence of unlawful conduct

despite knowledge of circumstances that would lead a

reasonable person to investigate whether unlawful conduct

had occurred." This is a simple negligence standard.<p>



It could be argued someday that a failure to implement

a compliance program is by itself evidence of willful

ignorance. But even if courts do not go that far, it seems

obvious that top managers cannot exercise due care without

some knowledge of the criminal regulations applicable to

their activities and some efforts to prevent criminal conduct

by their subordinates. This means that intensified compliance 

efforts are imperative -- if not to qualify for the

mitigation in sentencing, then at least to avoid aggravating

circumstances.<p>



<H4>&iuml; Shareholder Liability</h4>



The Sentencing Guidelines offer credit for qualifying

compliance programs and specify the content of the programs 

in general terms. If a company has no such program

and happens to be involved in criminal proceedings,

shareholder suits are likely and they will be difficult to

defend.<p>



It would be most unappealing to argue that the company

did not bother to implement a qualifying program because

compliance credits are hard to obtain. Even if a compliance

program would not have affected the sentence, a plaintiff

could easily argue that it might have prevented the offense

in the first place.<p>

<hr><p>

The Guidelines provide general instructions for an

"effective" compliance program. These instructions may

be summarized as follows:<p>



"The organization must have established compliance

standards and procedures .... " What this means, as a

practical matter, is that a company must canvass its potential

criminal exposure across the board and implement compliance 

programs for the likely risks. There needs to be a

formal record of these efforts, and appropriate written

policies need to be developed.<p>



It probably does not mean that all compliance efforts for

all potential risks have to be formalized with a lot of

paperwork, but it does mean that there has to be some

record to show that particular risks were considered and

given attention, albeit informal attention. The larger the

company, the more complete this record has to be.<p>



Specific high-level managers must have "overall responsibility" 

for compliance. No single individual (like a general

counsel) has to have responsibility for all compliance

matters -- and this is probably not a very good idea anyway.<p>



But responsibility for compliance in each area of potential

criminal exposure must be in the job description of some

high-level manager. And since (to avoid aggravating circumstances) 

it will be in a company's interest to have a

narrow definition of high-level management, this means

that very senior people will have to take an interest in law

compliance.<p>



The company should take "care not to delegate substantial

discretionary authority to individuals" with "a propensity

to engage in illegal activities." Since repeat offenders in the

corporate setting are probably very rare, this may be of

limited practical importance for sentencing.<p>



This provision may, however, have an important in

terrorem effect on employees because it suggests that any

criminal conduct could have serious consequences for their

future employment anywhere in their industry -- even if

they are not individually charged.<p>



The standards and procedures must be communicated

"effectively" by "training programs" or "publications."

This means that a paper program is necessary but not

sufficient. The precise form of communication, and the

level of effort required, will vary from company to company

and from crime to crime.<p>



This provision will require both very careful planning

and careful documentation of decisions. Any effort -- 

reasonable at the time -- is going to look inadequate in the

light of hindsight if a crime is committed, and the rationale

for the decision to undertake or not undertake particular

compliance initiatives will be important. In this area -- as

in other areas of corporate governance -- the quality of

records is likely to become as significant as the quality of

decisions.<p>



The company must have "monitoring and auditing

systems reasonably designed to detect criminal conduct,"

and have a publicized "reporting system" that will enable

employees to report offenses by others "without fear of

retribution. "<p>



This is something new. Existing compliance programs

in many companies are not designed to detect offenses

effectively, and not many companies have publicly 

announced (as opposed to informal) procedures for the

protection of whistleblowers.<p>



Standards must be enforced by "appropriate disciplinary

mechanisms, including, as appropriate, discipline of individuals 

responsible for the failure to detect an offense."<p>



The reference to "appropriate" discipline surely means

that a corporation can extend the same leniency to employees

who report themselves as prosecutors extend to corporations

which report themselves. Otherwise, an important source

of information will dry up, and overall compliance efforts

will suffer. The reference to discipline of individuals for

failure to detect an offense means that attention to com-

pliance issues will necessarily become the responsibility of

a broad segment of management.<p>



The program should be appropriately modified after

detection of an offense. This particular provision seems

self-evident, as do the subsequent comments that the "requisite 

degree of formality" depends on the size of the

organization, compliance programs must be tailored to the

particular risks of a company's business, and that a company

should learn from its prior history.<p>



Two final comments, however, are noteworthy. First, as

previously mentioned, failure to detect a single offense

"does not mean that the program was not effective."

"Recurrence of [similar] misconduct" by the company,

however, "casts doubt on whether it took all reasonable

steps to prevent such misconduct." You get one bite of the

apple, not two.<p>



Second, it is important for the company "to incorporate

and follow applicable industry practice." This means that

it will be prudent for companies in similar lines of business

to pool information on their compliance programs.<p>



<H3>Conclusion</h3>



The new Guidelines for Sentencing of Organizations not

only sanction greater penalties than companies have experienced 

before but also, as a practical matter, impose greater

and sometimes unprecedented compliance burdens. Corporate 

counsel need to make a ground-up examination of their

present compliance efforts, and reshape them to conform to

the standards set out in the guidelines -- more on account

of the greatness of the risks than the greatness of the

rewards.

<EM>EDITOR'S NOTE: Kirk Jordan is the President of Compliance

Systems Legal Group and serves on the National Center for

Preventive Law Commission on Corporate Compliance Standards. Mr. Jordan 

gratefully acknowledges the research assistance of Todd Ericson, a student 

at the Universiity of Denver College of Law, and Michele Salazar of the 

<A HREF="http://www.pacificrim.net/~ncpl/">NCPL</a> in the research of 

consent decrees and the preparation of this article.</em><p>



On November 1, 1991, the Federal Organizational Sentencing Guidelines 

became law. The Guidelines provide organizations with significant 

incentives to establish "effective" corporate compliance programs to 

prevent and detect misconduct.<p>



In the three years since the Guidelines' enactment, however,

organizations have struggled with the question of how to design

and implement compliance programs that will be deemed

"effective" by the govemment and the courts. Unfortunately, the

Guidelines themselves do not provide all the answers. Although

they list seven "minimum" criteria for an organization's compliance 

program, the Guidelines do not provide a precise formula

for effective compliance, opting for a flexible approach that

allows organizations to tailor their programs to their own culture

and business operations.<p>



While the Guidelines' flexible approach has advantages, it has

also left many organizations uncertain about whether they have

taken the right steps in the design and implementation of their

compliance programs. Organizations looking for additional

guidance will find it worthwhile to review the consent decrees

and plea agreements that other organizations have reached with

federal agencies since the Guidelines became effective. Our

survey of such agreements revealed that many impose a

comprehensive compliance program or enhancements to the

organization's existing program.<p>



This article briefly reviews the surveyed consent decrees and

plea agreements that impose compliance programs. It then

summarizes the principles that organizations can glean from the

imposed compliance programs and, perhaps, apply to their own

situations.<p>



<H3>TYPES OF AGREEMENTS IMPOSING COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS</h3>



In the three years since the Guidelines became effective,

compliance programs have been imposed in connection with

consent decrees and plea agreements covering a variety of

underlying crimes. Although our survey was not exhaustive,

agreements settling antitrust offenses, usually involving price

fixing, make up the largest single group of cases in which

compliance programs were imposed. The organizations involved in 

antitrust settlements were from diverse industries,

including waste disposal companies, hospitals, a physicians'

association, health care providers, munitions manufacturers,

automobile body repair shops, airlines and an airline tariff

publishing company.<p>



Since the enactment of the Guidelines, compliance programs

also have been imposed in connection with the settlement of

various environrnental offenses, including violations of the

Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, the Emergency Planning and

Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA), the emergency release

reporting requirements of the Superfund law and hazardous

waste violations. In other cases, a defense contractor agreed to

the imposition of an enhanced compliance program in connection 

with the company's settlement of potential criminal fraud

charges. Compliance programs also were imposed in connection 

with broker-dealers' settlements of securities laws violations, 

a large insurance company's settlement of charges that its

agents engaged in misleading sales practices and a supermarket

chain's settlement of wage and hour law violations.<p>



Our survey suggests that the three most comprehensive

compliance programs imposed in the last three years were in

connection with settlements by C.R. Bard, Inc., National Medical

Enterprises, Inc. (NME) and Denny's, Inc. The C.R. Bard

agreement settled charges in connection with Bard's manufacture 

and shipment of adulterated heart catheters. The NME

agreement settled health care fraud charges arising out of

activities at NME's psychiatric and substance abuse facilities. The

Denny's consent decree settled civil allegations that the restaurant 

chain systematically discriminated against customers on the

basis of race in violation of federal public accommodations laws.

The fines imposed on Bard ($61 million), NME ($379 million)

and Denny's ($54 million) are by far the largest ever levied for

the types of offenses underlying each case. Moreover, the

compliance programs imposed in the Bard and NME cases are

designed to prevent and detect violations of all laws affected hy

the companies' respective business activities, not simply the

laws at issue in the underlying settlements.<p>



<H3>COMPLIANCE PROGRAM PRINCIPLES DISTILLED FROM THE AGREEMENTS</h3>



Although the surveyed agreements involve organizations

from different industries and a variety of underlying offenses,

the compliance programs imposed contain recurring elements. As

one would expect, the principal elements of the compliance

programs follow the Guidelines' criteria. Many of the programs

go even further, however; they flesh out the Guidelines' criteria

by mandating specific polices, procedures and systems designed 

to ensure "effective" compliance. Admittedly, these

programs were imposed after a major compliance failure, and must

be considered in that context. Nevertheless, these compliance

programs, which bear the imprimatur of various regultory and

enforcement agencies and the courts, may offer valuable insight

into what those entities expect organizations' compliance

programs to look like.<p>



<H4>Establish a Formal Compliance Management and Oversight Structure</h4>



<Strong>Empower a high level manager or managers to direct

the organization's compliance program.</strong> The compliance

programs imposed under consent decrees and plea agreements

consistently require the establishment (or reaffirmation) of a

formal compliance management and oversight structure. The

structure usually consists of the appointment of one or more

senior managers to serve as a compliance or ethics officer and

visible senior management support for, and involvement in, the

compliance process. Often, the structure also includes a special

committee of senior managers and/or the board of directors to

oversee the company s compliance program.<p>



Under Bard's compliance program, for instance, a new

compliance officer, called a "Compliance Coordinator", is to

have direct, open access to senior management and to a special

board committee charged with ultimate responsibility for compliance 

matters. Bard's compliance officer is directed to report

regularly to the board committee regarding the company's

compliance program and whether he has received the full

support and cooperation of the company's senior management.<p>



Denny's agreed to hire a "Civil Rights Monitor" with broad

powers to oversee the design and implementation of the

company's compliance program. For example, the monitor is

directed to establish a compliance training and communication

program for Denny's employees and agents, implement a

system to test Denny's compliance with public accommodation

laws, and investigate and document any customer or employee

complaints of racial discrimination.<p>



Compliance programs imposed under the antitrust consent

decrees almost uniformly require the company to appoint an

antitrust compliance officer wl1o is charged with supervising and

implementing the company's program to comply with the

antitrust laws. A company which settled charges under the Fair

Labor Standards Act (FLSA) agreed to designate a labor standards 

ombudsman to coordinate company-wide compliance with the law.<p>



Several large organizations that settled securities, environmental 

and government procurement law violations agreed to

appoint regional compliance officers and/or compliance officers at 

each of the organization's facilities. Those officers

typically report to a top compliance officer or to a compliance

committee at the organization's headquarters.<p>



<Strong>Directly involve the organization's board of directors.</strong>

The compliance programs of several organizations require the

creation of special committees of the boards of directors,

sometimes comprised solely of independent outside directors.

These committees have ultimate oversight responsibility for

the companies' compliance programs. A board compliance committee

and, in some cases, the entire board, is typically charged

with reviewing and formally adopting the company's compliance 

standards, procedures and systems, interacting regularly

with senior management and/or the company's compliance

officer(s) regarding compliance issues and reporting periodically 

to the full board.<p>



<Strong>Actively involve Senior Management in the organization's

compliance effort.</strong> Under Bard's compliance program, senior

management is required to participate actively in the

oversight and implementation of the company's program. At

every board meeting, Bard's chief executive officer will report

on the company's compliance with applicable laws and regula-

tions. Other surveyed compliance programs establish manage-

ment committees made up of senior executives to provide

corporate direction to the companies' compliance programs and

to act as liaisons with compliance officers.<p>





<H4>Carefully Delegate Substantial Discretionary Authority</h4>



Several of the imposed compliance programs address the

issue of the delegation of substantial discretionary authority. In

these cases, the companies are required to adopt policies and

procedures designed to prevent the delegation of substantial

authority to anyone whom the companies know or should know

is likely to break the law.<p>



Under Bard's program, for example, substantial discretionary

authority is given "only to individuals whom [Bard] is confident

will not engage in illegal activities." Bard's compliance officer

will review annually the company's delegation of substantial

discretionary authority by considering information in personnel

files, the results of company audits, managers' opinions and

surveys of companies with which Bard does business. Following

the review, Bard's compliance officer will recommend to senior

management appropriate changes in policy and procedure.<p>



Under its compliance program, NME will not hire anyone

whom the company knows or should know has been convicted

of a criminal health care offense. The company also agreed that

if any employee or contractor is charged with a criminal offense

or proposed for debarment from work with the government,

NME will immediately remove that person from any responsibil-

ity for NME's business operations. The employee or contractor

also will be terminated upon a subsequent conviction or

debarment.<p>



In another example, a broker-dealer agreed to implement

procedures to identify salespeople with substantial disciplinary

histories or who have been the subject of significant customer

complaints. Approval of senior compliance managers is

required before any such salespeople are hired.<p>



<H4>Adopt Compliance Standards and Procedures Tailored to the Organization's Business Operations</h4>



As one would expect, the compliance programs imposed

pursuant to consent decrees and plea agreements typically

require organizations to adopt or revise existing compliance

standards and procedures that are designed to detect and

prevent the recurrence of the kinds of offenses underlying the

settlements. A large securities broker-dealer, for example,

agreed to review and revise its policies and procedures to

address specified securities laws violations. The consent decrees

entered in settlement of antitrust violations, which generally

prohibit price fixing, are themselves usually incorporated into

the companies' compliance standards.<p>



Denny's will review and, if appropriate, revise its written

policies to ensure that they promote nondiscriminatory behavior

on the part of employees and agents. A defense contractor

agreed to overhaul its procurement policies and procedures and

to adhere to the principles of the Defense Industry Initiative on

Business Ethics and Conduct. Similarly, a company that agreed

to an environmental consent decree adopted an environmental

compliance manual. And Bard, a maker of medical devices, will

utilize various compliance standards and procedures in its

program, including a code of ethics for health care providers and

institutions.<p>



<H4>Effectively Communicate the Mandatory Standards and Procedures</h4>



<Strong>Distribute the compliance standards and consider requiring 

certifications.</strong> The majority of the imposed compliance programs 

require company compliance personnel to

distribute the company's compliance standards and procedures

to existing employees and agents. New employees and agents

must also promptly receive the standards and procedures after

they are hired or retained. At several companies, each employee

is required to certify in writing, on an annual basis, that he or

she has reviewed, understands and agrees to abide by the compliance 

standards and procedures.<p>



<Strong>Provide formal training in the organization's compliance 

standards.</strong> The overwhelming majority of compliance

programs surveyed also mandate some form of training in the

company's compliance standards and procedures. The principal

goal of such compliance training is to ensure that employees and

other agents are familiar with applicable laws and regulations,

and with the company's procedures for the reporting and

investigation of compliance violations.<p>



Some compliance programs require all employees to undergo

compliance training, while a second group mandates training for

employees whose responsibilities involve compliance with the

laws underlying the settlement. A third group of programs

explicitly requires compliance training only for managerial and

supervisory employees.<p>



The most comprehensive compliance programs, imposed on

Bard, NME and Denny's, require training of virtually all employees. 

As is true in a majority of the other programs surveyed, the

Bard and NME programs also require that compliance training

be administered annually. Under Denny's program, the required

training is "a necessary condition for the continued employment" 

of the applicable employees and agents.<p>



A consent decree settling environmental offenses under

EPCRA and Superfund's emergency release reporting requirements 

requires that certain managers with significant

compliance responsibilities receive eight hours of training. In

that case, internal environmental auditors must receive eighty

hours of initial training, followed thereafter by sixteen hours

annually.<p>



<Strong>Communicate the company's commitment to compliance

using supervisors and other managers.</strong> Supervisors at

Bard and NME must discuss the company's compliance standards 

and procedures with their employees. They must inform

supervised employees that strict compliance with the company's

standards is a condition of employment, the violation of which

will result in appropriate disciplinary action, including possible

dismissal.<p>



Bard and NME also agreed to post prominently notices that

detail the companies' commitment to compliance with all

applicable laws and regulations. Bard's notices must designate

the procedure for reporting and investigating possible misconduct.<p>



<H4>Use Customized Measures to Achieve and Measure Compliance</h4>



<Strong>Conduct internal audits under the direction of independent 

auditors.</strong> Many of the compliance programs require

companies to conduct internal audits of the business activities

that gave rise to the underlying offenses. A common requirement 

for such audits is that the auditors be independent; that is,

the auditors must be either outside consultants, or if internal,

they must not report to the individuals or facilities being audited.

The compliance programs imposed in connection with the

settlement of environmental crimes typically require an outside

consulting firm to audit the companies' facilities to measure

compliance with the environmental laws and regulations at

issue. Before selling or transferring any psychiatric or substance

abuse facility, NME will retain an independent third party to

conduct a comprehensive review of health care law compliance

at the facility. The civil rights monitor at Denny's is directed to

develop and implement tests, using discrete groups of black and

white "customers," to monitor Denny's compliance with the

federal public accommodations laws. At least half of the tests

must be conducted by an independent, qualified civil rights

organization.<p>



The Bard compliance program sets forth a detailed legal

compliance auditing scheme. Internal auditors will conduct

both financial and nonfinancial audits to promote legal compliance. 

Independent, outside auditors also will conduct annual

financial and nonfinancial audits with respect to legal compliance. 

All of the Bard audit results will be provided to the

compliance officer and the appropriate board committee.<p>



A large securities broker-dealer must have outside auditors

conduct "statistically valid" surveys of customers to test how

effective the broker-dealer's new "sales practices" supervisory

procedures are in achieving compliance. Other audit provisions

include a supermarket chain's agreement to conduct regular

internal audits of the company's compliance with the FLSA, the

subject matter of the chain's consent decree.<p>



<Strong>Establish a misconduct reporting system for employees

and agents.</strong> Several of the surveyed compliance programs

require the establishment of a misconduct reporting system that

employees and agents may use to report known or suspected

violations of the law or company compliance policy.<p>



In Bard's case, the compliance officer is required to establish

and oversee a widely publicized reporting system that employees

may use to report (anonymously, if preferred) misconduct or

impropriety relating to the company's operations. Although

Bard's employees will not be punished for making good faith

reports, the company's reporting system mandates that employees 

report suspected or confirmed misconduct.<p>



A defense contractor's program requires that the telephone

numbers of members of the company's business ethics committee, 

composed of the compliance officer and other senior

managers, be publicized to all company employees. A Supermarket 

chain will establish an internal dispute resolution procedure 

by which employees may report alleged FLSA violations

Under a plan adopted prior to the implementation of its

compliance program but implicitly approved by the Department

of Justice, NME established a telephone "hotline" system for

employees and patients.<p>



<H4>Enforce the Standards and Procedures with Consistent, Case-Specific Discipline</h4>



<Strong>Establish formal disciplinary systems.</strong> The Bard compliance 

program imposes a disciplinary system for compliance

violations that tracks the language of the Guidelines' criterion.

Under Bard's program, the compliance officer is charged with

establishing a consistent, company-wide disciplinary system,

documenting all disciplinary actions the company takes for

violations of its compliance standards and reporting annually to

company management about the disciplinary system. Disciplin-

ary decisions will be made by appropriate Bard officials in

consultation with the company's compliance officer.<p>



A large securities broker-dealer's compliance program requires 

the company to implement systems to communicate to

appropriate managers in the law and compliance departments

any customer complaints or disciplinary actions taken against

company salespeople or other employees. These managers are

charged with recommending appropriate discipline, including

possible dismissal. If the disciplinary recommendation is not

accepted, the compliance committee of the board is to be

notified promptly.<p>



<Strong>Consider including compliance Issues in employee performance 

appraisals.</strong> Two of the surveyed compliance programs mandate 

that supervisors' and managers' performance

appraisals consider their efforts to promote compliance and

ethical behavior at the company. In a related provision, Bard

promises that employees who perform regulatory, medical or

quality assurance functions will not receive any compensation

that is tied to product approvals or the company's financial

performance.<p>





<H4>Respond Reasonably Aftrer the Detection of an Offense</h4>



<Strong>Promptly investigate known or suspected offenses.</strong> 

Several of the programs surveyed specifically require the company to

respond promptly to violations of the company's compliance

policies and procedures, and to take action to prevent further

similar offenses. Following a violation or a suspected violation,

Bard's compliance officer will conduct an investigation, and

make an appropriate recommendation to senior management, which

will render a decision. Bard's compliance officer will prepare a

memorandum detailing the investigatlon, recommendatlon and

decision; and a copy will be forwarded to a committee of the

board of directors. Denny's civil rights monitor is charged with

investigating any complaints of discrimination by customers or

employees and any reports of discriminatory actions or conduct

at the company.<p>



<Strong>Report a substantlated offense to the appropriate

governmental or regulatory agency.</strong> To receive credit for a

compliance program, the Guidelines require a company to

report a substantiated criminal offense to the appropriate

governmental authorities after an internal investigation. Several

of the surveyed programs closely track these requirements. For

instance, if the investigation undertaken by Bard's compliance

officer reveals a violation of the law, Bard's written policy

requires the company to voluntarily and promptly report the

violation to the appropriate governmental agency. Similarly, if

Bard learns that any statement that the company previously

made to a governmental agency is materially incorrect, the

company will promptly report and correct the error.<p>



NME's compliance program requires the company to report

any "credible evidence" at any of NME's facilities of a civil or

criminal violation of the laws governing federally funded health

care programs. A company that settled EPCRA and Superfund

violations will notify the EPA of any reportable event uncovered

during the company's environmental audit. Similarly, a defense

contractor will notify the government within sixty days if the

company's ethics and compliance officer learns of any credible

allegations of criminal conduct within the company or a

subsidiary company.<p>



<Strong>Modify the compliance program to prevent further

similar offenses.</strong> Following a violation, the Bard compliance

program will be modified to the extent possible to prevent

similar offenses in the future.<p>





<H3>GOVERNMENTAL AND JUDICIAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS</h3>



A final point that emerges from the surveyed compliance

programs is that if an organization's compliance program is

imposed in connection with a consent decree or plea agreement,

the government or the courts are likely to be substantially

involved in the ensuing compliance program. For example,

under many of the programs, companies are required to make

periodic reports to the court or governmental agencies involved.

Similarly, many programs call for the appointment of monitors

or consultants, who will report to the government or the courts

on compliance at the organization.<p>



In the Bard case, for example, an "independent outside consultant,"

both acceptable and reporting to the FDA, is granted full and

unannounced access to many of the company's records, employees and

operations in order to monitor Bard's compliance. The consultant

will issue an annual report to the FDA regarding the consultant's

inspections, findings and recommendations. Bard also will prepare

separate annual reports to the FDA, which will analyze Bard's

compliance with FDA regulations during the preceding year and

disclose whether Bard's audits uncovered any violations. These

reports are to be signed by top management officials and the

compliance officer.<p>



For five years, NME will file an annual "Compliance Report"

with the Department of Health and Human Services. The

Compliance Report, which must be certified by NME's compliance 

officer, will describe the company's compliance program

during the preceding year.<p>



For four years, Denny's civil rights monitor will prepare semi-annual 

reports to the Department of Justice describing the

company's compliance activities and any complaints received

and/or investigations undertaken by the monitor in the preced-

ing six months. The monitor's report also will set objectives to

ellmlnate any discriminatlon concerns identified. Denny's is

also required to report on the company s training and testing

programs, and detall the company's advertisements and promotional 

material to ensure that they comply with the consent

decree.<p>



In a final example, the board audit committee of a defense

contractor has been directed to study measures to ehance the

company's compliance programs. in doing so, the committee must

solicit recommendations from the United States Attorney's Office

and other governmental agencies and provide a draft report to

the agencies for comment.<p>



<H3>CONCLUSION</h3>



It is our experience that many organizations simply do not know

how to determine if their compliance programs will be deemed

"effective" under the Guidelines. The principles outlined above,

sanctioned by the government and the courts through consent decrees

and plea agreements, point to some of the critical areas that

organizations should consider in designing and implenmenting their

compliance programs. As for oorganizations that have not yet

focused on internal comliance, the cases considered above also

teach that now is the time to make organizational compliance a

priority.<p>



<H3>Survey of Consent Decrees:<br>

Additional Noteworthy Points</H3>



<Strong>Communication of information.</strong> In a case where a company had made

repeated fraudulent statements to customers, the FTC has required

the company to provide a "risk disclosure" document for every

customer's signature. The company must also make a risk disclosure

at the beginning and the end of any paid radio advertisements that

are more than five minutes long.<P>



<Strong>Avallability of counsel for advice to employees.</strong> 

Four of the surveyed consent decrees require communication to the employees

that the company's legal advisors are available to confer witll

them about the final judgment and the applicable laws.<p>



<Strong>Use of independent consultants.</strong> In several decrees, 

both the EPA and the SEC have required outside consultants to establish

compliance policies and procedures. In one instance, the SEC

required the offending company to retain a consultant "not

unacceptable" to the SEC to conduct an extensive review of the

company's policies and procedures. The company must then implement

all of the changes or programs the consultant recommends. If the

company finds any of the recommended  changes burdensome, it can

submit an alternative plan to the consultant, who determines the

final plan. All of the consultant's recommendations must be

implemented with six months of the final report. One year later,

the consultant must review the success of the new policies and

procedures.<p>



<Strong>Audit requirements.</strong> Eleven consent decrees require the compliance

officer to make annual status reports to the regulatory agency.

This implies that an annual audit would be necessary, but details

are not given as to how it should be conducted.<p>



<Strong>Audit of customers.</strong> The SEC has required a security sales firm to

audit its customers over a three-year period to test the

effectiveness of its sales practice supervisory procedures.<p>



<Strong>Access to company records and officials.</strong> Eleven consent decrees

require the offending companies to give appropriate regulatory

agencies access to documents relevant to the consent decree. The

agencies also have the right to interview corporate officers and

directors.<p>



<Strong>Company Size.</strong> How large does a company have to be before a formal

program is required? Not large, apparently. Three small automobile

dealerships in Casper, Wyoming (population 50,000) were prosecuted

by the Department of Justice for antitrust violations in a scheme

to fix prices for auto body repair in the Casper trade area. The

consent decree included a formal compliance program for all three

businesses.<p>



In a case of inadequate monitoring of problem assets, the Office

of Contract Compliance required a bank with only twenty-eight

million dollars in assets to implement a written compliance

program. The program must include an independent loan review

system, increased audit staff and a a three-year capital plan.<p>



The SEC may be specifically targeting smaller organizations.

Mathew Fink, president of the Investment Company Institute,

has noted that the SEC is shifting its inspection emphasis from

the 100 largest mutual fund complexes to smaller fund complexes

because of their lack of sophistication in compliance programs.<p>



These cases may be anomalies. They seem to indicate, however,

that in the eyes of some regulatory agencles, a company

does not have to be a Fortune 500 company to need a compliance

program.<p>



<Strong>Technology and Compliance.</strong> With the pace of teclmological

change accelerating, organizations must anticipate the

attendant possibilities for noncompliance. A major life insurance

company was prosecuted when its sales people began producing

"custom" sales literature from laptop computers in the homes of

prospective customers. The company did not foresee that technology

could lead to the production of fraudulent sales literature. Any

sales literahlre that did not originate from or was not

specifically approved by the company was subsequently banned.<p>



<Strong>Non-business activities.</strong> A company should not assume its

liability will be limited hecause illegal conduct lies outside its

usual business activities. The EPA prosecuted a mining company for

violations of the Clean Air Act. In the process of closing

an old mine, the company destroyed some buildings in a manner that

did not comply with the EPA's asbestos-control requirements. The

EPA's consent decree added an asbestos-removal provision to the

company's compliance program.

<h5>Copyright&#169;1994 Preventive Law Reporter</h5>



<H4>By LAURA L. MONTY</h4>

<H5>Manager, Corporate Environmental Compliance<br>

Huntsman Chemical Corporation</h5>



<EM>LAURA MONTY is currently responsible for environmental

compliance programs for Huntsman Chemical's manufacturing 

sites worldwide.</em><p>



Beginning in the early 1970's, the seeds of what would

prove to be profound changes in the basic US business

terrain emerged in the form of new regulations, global

competition and the resultant pressures on productivity. Over

the ensuing 25 years, businesses were increasingly challenged

on many fronts, particularly in the areas of return on capital,

quality, worker safety, process safety and environmental

compliance.<p>



As businesses quickly discovered, these issues are inextricably

linked. Action on any one issue can affect performance in the

other areas, while neglect of any area can threaten the long-term

viability of a business. Moreover, these challenges must be met

within the framework dictated by tough global competition,

which has resulted in lean organizations with even leaner

resources. Like a zero sum game, safety, quallty, environmental

and process safety issues are not only integrally related, but

often compete for the same limited resources.<p>



Corporate compliance programs typically have not been

formulated to account for the realities of managing daily

activities at a plant site. Programs which consist primarily of

strict policy demands ("all employees must comply with all

applicable laws and regulations") and documenting that such

demands were communicated to employees are of diminishing use.<p>



The problem faced by plant management is not whether to

comply, but what to comply with and, more importantly, how

to achieve compliance with limited resources. This article will

describe one approach to creating a "compliance culture" in a

real-world setting, and discuss why the success of any

compliance program depends on its ability to provide an ongoing

process of continuous improvement.<p>



<H3>THE CHANGING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT</h3>



In the past two and a half decades, as performance demands

in areas such as safety, quality and environmental compliance

increased, classical management structures were stretched to

their limit. Many businesses held on to these classical structures

for several years, placing more people and financial resources

on the table to meet these new requirements. Functional

specialties were augmented or created to grapple with the new

'wrinkles" in the business terrain. This approach, however,

proved difficult to maintain in the face of increasingly severe

global competition.<p>



New tools were clearly needed to respond to these challenges. 

Answers emerged in the form of continuous process

improvement and management systems such as 

<A HREF="http://www.iso.ch/9000e/forum.html">ISO-9000</a> to

address productivity and quality issues. Due to a recognition of

common elements, quality and productivity systems were

integrated early in their development process.<p>



Some business and industry groups also developed management 

systems, to address environmental, health and safety (EHS)

concerns, such as the chemical industry's Responsible Care&AElig;

codes of management practice. Unlike their quality and productivity 

counterparts, however, EHS systems matured. as specialized 

and isolated processes.<p>



The impact of this isolated development has been most visible

at the point where a majority of compliance issues arise, at the

plant site, with predictable results. Specialized compliance

knowledge, such as the understanding of environmental permits

and regulations, is retained inside the EHS group, while most

process knowledge is retained in the operational unit. Consequently, 

the operations staff often have little awareness of

process changes which could create a non-compliant condition,

while the EHS staff have little knowledge of operational issues

or future plans.<p>



To ensure compliance, the EHS staff are forced to function as

police officers rather than advocates, which increases their need

for both monetary and personnel resources. Crises erupt,

consuming time and resources and preventing the development

of balanced, cost-effective solutions. Compliance must then be

achieved through the implementation of detailed procedures

and control systems, resulting in increased cycle times and

negative productivity. These types of responses serve to perpetuate 

the common sentiment that compliance is a necessary

evil that impedes production rather than an integral part of an

operation.<p>



Noting the similarities among management system elements

for quality, productivity and EHS compliance, proactive businesses 

have begun to seek the "Grand Unification Theory" of

compliance. An integrated system would allow compliance

elements in each of these areas to be merged into a total

business management system.<p>



An integrated management system has several obvious advantages 

which maximize the probability of success. There is a

greater likelihood of ownership by line operations, because a

single system is simpler for people to understand and manage

and thus may be viewed as making their job easier.<p>



A single system also makes more effective use of limited

resources by eliminating duplication of effort and speeding the

implementation process. The program of the month" syndrome

can be avoided because new system elements are added to an

existing framework. Any compliance program which is embedded 

into mainstream management functions has a greater

likelihood of success than its non-integrated counterpart.<p>



The design of an integrated system and its acceptance by the

workforce is critical to its success. Fortunately, there is no need

to reinvent the wheel. Several existing management system

models can be expanded to include compliance elements.

Although they vary in detail, all solid management systems have

several common elements which should be considered when

designing a compliance program.<p>



The elements discussed below are drawn from basic quality

management system principles developed by the 

<A HREF="http://www.cimio.co.uk/STEP/prodex/BSI.html">British Standards

Institute</a> and the <A HREF="http://www.iso.ch/welcome.html">International 

Organization of Standards (ISO)</a>.

As will become apparent, these principles apply equally well to a

compliance program as they do to a quality program.<p>



To illustrate how an integrated program based on these

principles functions in the workplace, each element will be

discussed with respect to an actual compliance process developed 

at a plastics manufacturing plant located in Alabama. At

this facility, an ISO-9002 quality process was being implemented

to achieve full certification for the site manufacturing operations.

Because all internal quality management systems were being

aligned with the ISO standards, it was an ideal opportunity to

attempt to integrate elements of compliance.<p>



The specific elements being integrated were in the areas of

safety, environmental compliance and process safety. These

areas were priorities because EHS regulatory compliance issues

are directly linked to operating variables in the manufacturing

process.<p>



<H3>POLICY STATEMENT</h3>



A management system should have a clear policy statement

which defines the business objectives and commitment. To

promote integration and still keep the policy statement a

reasonable length, a business may have separate sub-policies

which specifically address quality, safety, compliance, and so

on, with each supporting the overall objectives.<p>



These policy statements should receive visible support from

management and be communicated throughout the organization.

All employees, including new hires, should receive training

to promote understanding and awareness of the commitment

required.<p>



At the Alabama site, plant policy and goals were established

They became the guiding principles for the ISO-9002 effort and

were later expanded to include safety, process safety and

environmental compliance.<p>



<H3>ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE</h3>



A management structure which gives appropriate personnel

the authority to control key elements is needed within the

organization. ISO requires a site to have a central coordinator

with overall responsibility for the entire quality management

system. An integrated system may have several coordinators,

who are responsible for a piece of the management system (i.e.,

environmental compliance, quality, etc.).<p>



Additional people are needed at the unit level to maintain the

system documentation, ensure that the system is functioning to

identify non-conformances and implement appropriate corrective 

actions, and work with management to review the system

periodically for effectiveness. In an ISO 9002 system, area

representatives are appointed to coordinate these tasks for

their specific area of the plant. The number of area

representatives at a plant site is discretionary and will depend

upon the size and complexity of the site.<p>



In a program similar to ISO area representatives, volunteers

from each operating area at the Alabama plant formed a special

group called environmental representatives. These were individuals

who assumed responsibilities for environmental compliance in

addition to their usual operating duties. After general and

area-specific training, the environmental representatives promoted

environmental compliance awareness in their operational units,

acted as communication links between the EHS group and their

units, and provided a "first line of defense" for compliance with

permits in their units. In this way, the environmental

representative network pushed compliance responsibilities to the

operating floor to help achieve real compliance improvements.<p>



<H3>MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY</h3>



Management plays a significant role in the success of a

management system. It is responsible for obtaining the resources 

needed to ensure that the system functions properly.

Management should regularly examine the policies and procedures 

that make up the system and meet with the plant staff to

set goals, measure progress, analyze system performance and

review the results of internal audits. The purposes of managemnt 

review are to ensure appropriate actions are taken to

correct undesirable trends or changes and to encourage and

reward desirable performance.<p>



At the Alabama site, the plant manager and his staff set

measurable goals that covered all aspects of the manufacturing

process. Example of these goals included process measurements, 

such as first pass yield and turn-around times; environmental 

criteria, such as emissions per pound of product and

number of spills; quality measurements, such as customer

complaints; and safety criteria, such as the recordable rate of

injuries and the number of lost time accidents.<p>



The total team was involved in setting the site goals. Manufacturing 

management participated in setting environmental and

safety goals, while EHS personnel help set quality and productivity 

hurdles. In this manner, a high level of ownership

developed across the organization for all policies and goals.<p>



The management review process which was already in place

for ISO was used to review performance according to the

integrated goals, rather than quality goals alone. Utilizing Pareto

analysis and trend charting, the team defined problems and

developed and tracked corrective actions.<p>



The involvement of the plant manager was instrumental in

ensuring the system stayed fresh and the commitment to the

overall process did not slip. The site manager also ensured that

each successive achievement became the basis for the next

cycle's goal setting. In this way, management reviews drove the

continuous improvement that is essential to the efficacy of the

ISO process.<p>



<H3>SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION</h3>



The management system should be documented in sufficient

detail to show how the system will produce the desired result.

Each step of any process that can affect the desired system

outcome should be documented in a procedure and included in

a system manual.<p>



In a truly integrated system, each procedure should cover all

aspects of quality, productivity, and EHS compliance. As a

business begins the process of integration, however, each

component may have its own manual, with sections and layouts

conforming to a master format. A comprehensive document

control procedure with scheduled reviews for revision is critical

to ensure that policies and procedures are kept current.<p>



At the Alabama site, environmental representatives received

resource books that were specific to their areas of responsibility.

The resource book included the documentation for environmental 

compliance with copies of area permits, emission points,

waste streams and applicable <A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/">EPA</a> 

and <A HREF="http://www.osha.gov/">OSHA</a> regulations.<p>



When the resource books from each area were combined,

they formed the basis for a site environmental manual. Taken

together, the safety, quality, environmental and process safety

manuals documented the entire site management system. The

long-term goal was to have fewer separate procedures for any

single aspect of the system (e.g., a safety procedure), because

each aspect of the site goals would be covered in the operating

procedures themselves.<p>



<H3>INTERNAL AUDITING</h3>



A good management system documents the critical procedures 

and verifies, through its internal audits, that the procedures 

are understood and followed. To be effective, internal

audits should document the non-conformances found, the

corrective actions required, the date of implementation, and the

person responsible. Auditors should be trained in auditing

methodology and independent of the activity being audited.<p>



Auditing can also be a powerful tool to advance integration

efforts. Tailored audit protocols can mix quality, productivity,

safety and environmental checkpoints into a single process

review.<p>



This approach was utilized at the Alabama site. The ISO-9002

internal auditing protocol was expanded to add compliance

elements that were concrete, understandable, easily determined

by checklists or physical inspections, and critical to compliance

with either regulatory requirements or area permits.<p>



Audits were not performed by managers. After receiving

training in how to conduct audits, engineers, operators and

secretaries from across the site performed the task. The auditing

function enhanced site compliance activities by providing solid

improvements in detecting and correcting deficiencies.<p>





<H3>CORRECTIVE ACTION AND FOLLOW UP</h3>



The findings of internal audits, together with any other

observed system failures, should be used to assess the appropriate 

actions needed to eliminate undesirable results. Corrective

actions should be documented and analyzed to confirm that the

causes of the problems have been correctly identified and

removed. Consistent follow-up is required to obtain closure on

all recommended corrective actions. In this way, the process is

continually improved.<p>



The Alabama site used this method of corrective action and

follow-up as another pathway to integration by broadly defining

the term "non-conformance". The site defined non-conformance 

to mean any condition that led to results incompatible with

the overall site goals. In this way, chemical spills, accidents, and

permit excursions were addressed side-by-side with product

quality defects, customer complaints and missed deliveries.

When a non-conformance was detected, the team responded

and corrected such non-conformances within a single corrective

action process.<p>



This approach tended to weld all the important factors for

operation of the business, including compliance, into a single

powerful concept. The importance of safety and environmental

non-compliance corrective actions was elevated due to better

visibility across the site and to the broadened understanding of

their importance in the total operation.<p>



<H3>TRAINING</h3>



The importance of training to achieve the desired results cannot

be overstated clearly as the responsibility and activities to

support compliance are shifted downward in an operating

organization the need for both general and specific job training

increases. Further, in many instances such as OSHA's Process

Safety Management (PSM), regulations training is not only

essential but required by law. Since the PSM regulations are

also management-system based, an integrated approach to compliance

is particularly suited to achieving these standards.<p>



Management at the Alabama plant recognized the importance of

training and provided resources for focused training as an

integral part of the compliance program. The importance of

compliance was already a given well designed training programs

filled an important need by helping employees at the site

understand the specific compliance requirement of their jobs.<p>



Once the process of delegating compliance was implemented,

the demand for training within the organization increased as more

personnel become involved in the detection and correction of 

non-conformances. As a result, the EMS professionals found that their

roles shifted from "compliance enforcers" to those of consultants

and trainers, which leveraged their compliance efforts manyfold.<p>



<H3>CONCLUSION: SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION</h3>



Simply stated, the goal of a successful compliance program is to

ensure that all employees within a business understand how their

job duties can affect compliance. Like quality, compliance must be

achieved at every point where work is proceeding and decisions are

being made. As was seen in the example site program in Alabama,

when compliance knowledge and responsibilities are shared broadly

among many individuals in a business, Compliance is enhanced.<p>



 At most businesses, a significant cultural change will be required

to achieve individual accountability for compliance. The

individuals charged with defining and implementing a compliance

program need first to understand the attitudes that prevail in

their particular organization before they can begin to shape them.

Training and knowledge are the primary tools to help change

attitudes. People with changed attitudes in turn seek more

knowledge and training. The establishment of these training and

awareness resources begins the cycle of continuous improvement.<p>



 The improvement cycle will, over time, move the organizational

culture toward higher levels of integration. Once the process toward

a compliance culture begins, this change drives itself. In the face of

increasing regulation and tougher global competition, the choice

for most organizations will not be whether they should attempt to

create an integrated compliance culture within their operating

organizations, but when they should begin.

<h5>Copyright&#169;1995 Preventive Law Reporter</h5>



<H4>By HERBERT I. ZINN, Esq.</h4>

<H5>Arizona Public Service Company<br>

Phoenix, Arizona</h5>



Have you ever thought what it must have been like to sit in the

control room of a nuclear missile silo at the height of the Cold

War, just waiting for the alarm to go off? Sitting around a

hundred or more kilotons of nuclear destruction must have been

scary enough. But think what must have gone through the crewman's

mind as he whiled away the long, dreary hours -- waiting for the

unthinkable to happen. Will it scare either guy into not shooting

first; will it fire when I push the button; will it hit the

target after its long journey? And not least of all -- will it do

what it was designed to do?  Vaporize the target?  What will it

be like the day after?<p>



If you think about it, running a compliance program is a lot like

living in a nuclear missile silo.  You never really know if the

system you've designed will work until it is tested.  A clean

record concerning criminal prosecutions or civil claims is no

real test of a compliance program's effectiveness;  just like an

absence of nuclear war is no real test of the missile's

capability as a weapon. Compliance programs and nuclear missiles

are very similar in this respect: they are meant to deter some

undesired consequence. You hope to God you never have to rely on

them, but you will never really know for sure if they can

effectively achieve their objectives unless they are actually put

to the test.<p>



Metaphors aside, the threat of criminal prosecution, third party

lawsuits, gigantic litigation expenses and adverse public image

is the stuff that drives many companies to develop compliance

programs. No one knows for sure they will really work, even

though everyone starts from the same point -- a review of the

checklist for effective compliance programs set forth in <a href=../../../../download/seminars/fsg1.html>Section

8A1.1</a> of the Organizational Sentencing Guidelines (FSGs).<p>



Those in the know may even venture to consider the provisions of

the Draft Sentencing Guidelines For Environmental Crimes,

developed in the wake of the FSGs. (As of this writing, they are

still in draft form.)  Will orthodox observance of the

commandments of these two tablets assure an organization that it

will be insulated from the consequences of legal noncompliance?

Most assuredly not. Those who build their program on the model

described in the FSGs are merely framing out a house that will

have no walls, utilities or furnishings.<p>



<H3>What Is Meant By <I>Effectiveness?</i></h3>



Before effectiveness can be determined, it must be defined. Every

organization has a different notion of the word, based upon its

culture and objectives. Some say effectiveness means a program

that will get up to four points credit off the fine calculations

described in the FSGs. Those organizations stand the greatest

chance of testing their definition and their programs because

they have missed entirely the purpose of a compliance program. In

so doing, they sacrifice effectiveness and they court disaster.<p>



A second school of thought suggests that effectiveness is defined

by the program's ability to ward off criminal convictions. This

too misses the point. Investing the time to develop a compliance

program that addresses only one category of risk is like going to

the shoe store and purchasing only one shoe. You are going to

realize something is wrong shortly after you leave the store.

Why go to the trouble of developing a program if its jurisdiction

does not spread out to all kinds of risk that the organization

may confront: criminal, civil, legal and ethical alike?<p>



There are also those who define effectiveness on a broader scope.

They see its value as a way to proactively address all sorts of

risks, and in doing so, they are apt to wield their program based

on narrow constructions of their legal rights. As a result, they

throw out any notion of using their program to do the right

thing. In the end, they may win the battle, or even the war, but

the cost is enormous. Perhaps almost as costly as it would have

been to strike a settlement early on in the controversy and be

done with it.<p>



A fourth and emerging view among compliance scientists is that

effectiveness is defined on a very broad, multi-faceted front:<p>



&iuml; By the organization's ability to proactively perceive its

risks in every area of endeavor in which it functions and to

adjust its activities in a way that comports with the

expectations of the standards to which it is subject;<p>



&iuml; By the program's ability to spare the organization from

costly lessons, in terms of fines, damage awards and litigation

costs;<p>



&iuml; By the program's ability to build a culture in the

organization that is renowned for its appreciation of laudable

conduct; and,<p>



&iuml; If needed, by the program's ability to convince a

prosecutor to decline to prosecute (and, as a corollary, its

ability to convince the Court that, indeed, the organization is

entitled to the maximum consideration of its program under the

FSGs in terms of point reductions).<p>



<H3>How Can A Compliance Program Demonstrate Effectiveness?</h3>



Let's assume then that you buy into the definition that an

effective compliance program proactively manages risk, controls

litigation costs and avoids costly fines and damage awards.  How

do you know that your program effectively pursues these

objectives? Obviously, the absence of suits, fines and/or legal

fees is not the litmus test. One way to tell if you have an

effective compliance program (albeit in this writer's opinion not

the best way) is to test it against the provisions of the FSGs

and the Draft Environmental Guidelines.  The FSGs describe the

effective compliance program model in very strategic terms, laid

out in <I>Section 8A1.2(3)(k)</i> as seven basic criteria:<p>



<H5>Established compliance standards;<p>



Oversight by high-level personnel in the organization;<p>



Due diligence in the selection of employees and agents

who possess substantial discretionary authority;<p>



Training and communications;<p>



Monitoring and auditing;<p>



Non-discriminatory discipline; and<p>



Reasonable response to an occurrence of noncompliance

when it is discovered.</h5>



These are expressed in broad, strategic terms because they really

only give a hint at one approach to effectiveness. The criteria

purposefully do not take into consideration how they would work

in a variety of situations, such as differing organizational

size, industry or activity. The FSGs do instruct the Court to

consider their application based upon the size and sophistication

of the organization. However, that does not help the practitioner

understand how to proactively address effectiveness in the

design, implementation and management of the program.<p>



Nevertheless, these criteria are accepted in many quarters as the

bare minimum that must be considered when you undertake the

creation of a compliance program. In other words, <I>you are

courting with disaster if your program does not at least reflect

some aspect of each of these seven commandments</i>.<p>



The simple point here is that in terms of effectiveness, <I>the

devil is in the details</i>. A rigid, uninspired adherence to the

FSGs' definition of effectiveness will not only lead to

ineffectiveness, but also to a result opposite to what was

intended. Some very basic, good ideas about organizational

culture are reflected in the seven criteria that make sense.

Obviously, there needs to be something more. Let me suggest that

the <I>something more</i> starts with a thorough appreciation for

organizational culture. A commitment must be made to mold the

culture to deal with the little details upon which effectiveness

depends, to the extent of identifiable deficiencies that can

contribute to wrongdoing.<p>



In my opinion, the most important ingredient in assuring

effectiveness is the commitment of the highest authority in the

organization to a culture in which compliance thrives. Coupled

with a commitment (in terms of accountability, resources and

follow-through) at all personnel levels, it assures that the

vision of effective compliance is indeed appreciated as a core

value of the organization. It must be clearly appreciated by

everyone in the organization that if an employee or agent does

not agree with the philosophy of compliance endorsed as a value

of the organization, they had better consider employment

elsewhere. Harsh, yes, but so are the consequences if this

commitment does not translate into action.<p>



This may sound vanilla-coated, but why bother creating a

compliance program if you are not dedicated to its effective

operation? Even if the management of your organization considers

orthodox compliance to be an inappropriate invasion by government

into corporate management, consider this simple rationale for

effective compliance: if nothing else, it can be an important

cost management tool. If economic survival is an issue for the

organization, given today's competitive business environment,

then there is ample reason to be serious about compliance.

Economic survival is itself reason to take compliance very

seriously because noncompliance is a wasteful sink hole for

corporate dollars that could be better utilized elsewhere.<p>



In determining if the Draft Environmental Guidelines alter the

conclusion reached to this point, I think not. The Draft

Guidelines suggest to me a better appreciation by the draftsmen

for the facets of organizational culture that contribute to a

successful program in that they formulate strategies that make a

lot of sense. Pick up any book or article on effective compliance

programming, you will likely find the principles in the Draft

Guidelines are already there in some form or another. In articles

and texts, however, they are less threatening than they are in

the stone-like reality of an official guideline published by an

agency of the government.<p>



So, again, I come to the conclusion that effectiveness cannot be

prescribed, dictated or even measured based upon words on a page.

In this respect, neither the FSGs nor the Draft Environmental

Guidelines are useful tools in measuring effectiveness. The

essential ingredient to the "Secret Sauce" of effective

compliance rests on an intangible that can never be measured from

a page. That ingredient is the organization's adoption of a core

value that places adherence to <I>the right thing</i> very high up on

the list of accountabilities for employees and agents. In this

way, there is no mistaking the fact that in times of conflict

between the compliance core value and other values defined for

the organization, compliance will not be sacrificed, compromised

or watered down. Vanilla? Yes. Hard to administer? Yes. A little

unrealistic?  Maybe.  But why bother if you do not start at the

beginning?<p>



You can only make things worse for you and your organization if

the commitment to compliance is a mere charade. The risks extend

out beyond the direct fines and penalties that will inevitably

come your way. Indirect costs include:<p>



&iuml; The excessive cost of dealing with the incident;<p>



&iuml; The adverse impact on your organization's reputation in

your industry and in the community at large;<p>



&iuml; Increased costs of doing sloppy business, such as

interest on borrowings, lower market value of stock, higher

insurance premiums and higher workers compensation; and<p>



&iuml; The increased risk of shareholder dissatisfaction leading

to removal of executive management and directors, derivative

suits, etc.<p>



Truly effective compliance cannot be defined in terms of point

scores when your organization gets fined.  It must and does mean

something much more fundamental.<p>



<H3>Some Ways A Program Can Be Made To Work Effectively</h3>



I suppose at this point, to convince you that there is some truth

to this, I had better produce some worthwhile suggestions. In my

opinion, a compliance program has a chance to be effective if the

major emphasis is on proactivity. I do not mean to suggest that

reaction to incidents is not important, but the prime directive

of an effective compliance program should not be to react

appropriately to events of noncompliance. It should be to

minimize, if not eliminate, the opportunity for the noncompliance

to happen in the first place.  With this in mind, here are some

suggestions for ways to bolster the preventive aspects of the

program and its effectiveness.<p>



<H3>Common Sense Rules</h3>



"Common sense" is defined in three ways:<p>



&iuml; What value does the rule have to the employee who has to

live by it and use it;<p>



&iuml; What language is used to communicate the meaning and

intentions of the rule; and<p>



&iuml; What examples are offered to help the employee understand

the setting in which the rule is to be employed and the objective

to be achieved?<p>



The rules must take into consideration the organization's risk.

But at the same time they must recall that <I>people</i> create those

risks and have to be instructed and trained to identify  and

reduce them  in a predetermined way.<p>



Instead of setting out a brightline rule in your code of conduct,

consider a brief discussion in plain English about an employee's

job risks, why the risks need addressing and what can be done

about them. Then set down the rules, so there is some

appreciation for the issues.<p>



Another core issue is to make certain that every type of employee

receives the same message. In other words, front-line employees

should not be made to strictly follow rules while managers bend

them. Front-line employees will pick up the hypocrisy very early

-- breeding morale problems, inordinate risk takers and

whistleblowers galore.<p>



<H3>"Z Team" Type Involvement</h3>



"Z Teams" are a phenomenon of the reengineering craze. A "Z Team"

is a task group brought together to study and achieve a

particular result. Issues are considered from different

perspectives in the organization (including professionals,

management and support staff), as well as individuals with

differing job skills and backgrounds. In theory it creates a

better product in the sense that all relevant perspectives are

brought to bear on the formulation of solutions to common

organizational problems.<p>



If you expect a variety of different personalities to read the

same rule and get the same meaning from it, why not involve a

sampling of the variety in the formulation of your rules and in

the creation and management of the program? It may seem

complicated, but if managed correctly, it needn't be. You can

also gain an important element of effectiveness: the more cross-

boundary the fingerprints are on the program, the more likely it

will gain support and buy-in throughout the organization. Chances

are the product will be more reflective of the sub-values found

in differing areas of the organization.<p>



This type of involvement can be as simple as establishing

compliance teams in each department that are charged with taking

the rules and studying them to identify those that are relevant

to the workings of the department. By making front line employees

responsible for implementing the compliance program in the

department, you create a valuable tool.  Employees are exposed to

the rules in a meaningful way. They are made to think about them

and apply them to their jobs in ways that are meaningful to co-

workers. They also gain the opportunity to give feedback where

there are problems, instead of letting the problems persist

unknown or unremedied.<p>



<H3>Effective Management Oversight</h3>



Many organizations subscribe to the <I>"Flavor of the Month"</i>

Syndrome. They implement a new program or idea, expecting it to

be followed, but do little if anything in the follow-through to

support or assure its operation as intended.<p>



In the compliance context, follow-through can be defined

according to these considerations:<p>



&iuml; Establishing expressed accountabilities throughout the

organization's management to assure that compliance is a core

value similar to cost management,  customer service,  good

operating results and profitability.<p>



&iuml; Working hard to avoid double standards. Nothing impresses

employees more about management's insincerity than a code of

conduct that is like two sets of books -- one to apply to the

employees (generally with strict results) and one to apply to the

management and officers.<p>



&iuml; Direct, routine and visible involvement of executive

management in compliance issues to assure that the importance of

the subject is not lost as the organization's environment evolves

and changes. This can be achieved through one-on-one meetings

with executive management as they visit with departments or

through regular communications throughout the organization using

all sorts of media.<p>



&iuml; Routine Board review of compliance performance to

identify problems, issues and concerns. This should be led by

independent members of the Board who are not officers of the

organization. They may be a little more immune from the politics

of day-to-day management and may also bring in fresh

perspectives.<p>



&iuml; Visible celebration by management of good results

(discussed in more detail below).<p>



&iuml; Good listening skills. Employee concerns need to be

considered seriously by management and are treated with the same

degree of concern as if the message was delivered by angry

stockholders.<p>



<H3>Outside Critiques</h3>



Do you really care about the quality of your system of internal

controls? Why not ask others in your industry to critique your

compliance program? Some industries have established forums where

members meet to address the formulation of strategies to deal

with compliance issues. Others monitor trade organizations to

determine what is being done in the industry.<p>



Consider going an additional step. Locate one or more members of

your industry who are willing to work with you, conduct a best

practices study of their programs and decide if what you've

learned would be worth considering for your organization. Then

take this step further. From time to time, invite your neighbor

to do an informal review of your program and provide you with a

critique.<p>



Why would another organization want to cooperate with you on

this? Aren't they short enough on resources as it is, without

taking on the added responsibility of auditing your company? The

answer may lie in your willingness to reciprocate the favor free

of charge, thereby avoiding expensive formal audits by outside

experts for both parties.<p>



At first blush, this will drive legal counsel nuts. How can you

advocate the creation of non-privileged audits that suggest

shortcomings in your compliance program by third parties who are

not bound to secrecy, who may not be credible in their opinions

and who may inartfully draw conclusions that set illusory

standards? These are valid concerns, and now that we have

identified them, go about dealing with them rather than using

them as a rationale to discredit this approach. For example, pick

your partners carefully after considering their expertise and

reputation for compliance.<p>



If you are so privilege conscious, have your respective in-house

or outside counsel anchor the exercise. If you are still dubious,

agree up front not to create a paper trail. It is healthy to

proactively seek out criticism of one's program. The harm is not

identifying the shortcoming, and failing to promptly address its

correction when it is uncovered.<p>



<H3>Ample Real-Time Recognition For Good Performance</h3>



Actually, this aspect of effectiveness is a revisitation of the

role and importance of management in compliance programming. A

reward system rests principally upon management and its

willingness to use material gratitude as a way of promoting

desired conduct and performance.<p>



The most frequent complaint I hear about recognition is that it

comes too late rather than that it is too little. The easiest

thing to say is "job well done," but this is often difficult for

some managers. Desired performance and habit needs to be promoted

and encouraged.  Reward is the way to do that and "real time"

reward works best.<p>



Simply defined, "real-time" reward is recognition that happens

when the desired conduct is witnessed. Some reward systems merely

catalogue good performance, and annually, the employee hears

about something good or bad he did almost a year later. "Real

time" reward works to remind the employee at the time of

performance that desired performance was appreciated. The result

will likely be that the employee will seek to repeat the

performance to ensure eligibility for more recognition.<p>



If you want to build trust, encourage employees to take notice of

the legal and ethical aspects of their jobs and to hunt out

issues that may be risks to them and their organization.

Encourage performance not with the threat of discipline, but with

the offer of thanks that comes from a reward system that is

designed to reinforce the objectives of the compliance program.<p>



<H3>Excellence in Communication</h3>



Too often, organizations take for granted the resources tied up

in communications.  Excellence in communication is developed, but

never used to capacity. For instance, some companies invest in

state-of-the-art video systems but never use them as the

principal means to get messages to employees. Or they employ

substantial staffs of workers to write articles that miss

opportunities to include valuable messages that promote

compliance. Many organizations don't have effective

communications about compliance because they miss simple

opportunities to weave a compliance message into mainstream

communications that are delivered to the workforce.<p>



Another dimension of excellence in communication is frequency.

This is not daily feedings of compliance news, but more than an

annual refresher. At a minimum, effective compliance

communication takes into consideration at least these factors:<p>



&iuml; More frequent communication in areas of higher risk to

the organization, its employees and agents.<p>



&iuml; Prompt communication when incidents occur, to ward off

the ill effects of the rumor mill and the resulting confusion and

adverse effects on morale. This needs to be tempered by and

coordinated with your program's response plan in order to

preserve applicable privileges and other timing concerns.<p>



&iuml; Employment of plain-English "war stories" that employees

and agents understand and can relate to in their job capacities.<p>



&iuml; Explicit accountability of leaders and managers to

regularly share information with employees that is needed to

enable them to do their jobs in a compliant way.<p>



&iuml; Diversity in the way messages are delivered. Redundancy

is not wasteful: if it gets the message across, it is cost

beneficial.<p>



<H3Down-Top Feedback</h3>



This is effective communication revisited, too. To me, the

correct definition of communication is <I>the exchange of ideas or

information</i> -- meaning that for communication to work, it has to

be two-way in nature.<p>



Returning messages in an organization is very, very important.

They are the way to determine if your message was understood or

even received. They convey to you shortcomings in the quality,

accuracy or completeness of the message that may require that you

re-adjust what it is you are saying to your employees. They are a

morale-building vehicle.<p>



Employees who know that they can talk to their management, share

their views and, most importantly, have their views heard and

acted upon, tend to buy into management's goals and form a

stronger bond for the overall benefit of the organization.<p>



Conversely, it can be a devastating element on the morale of the

workforce to realize that management could not care less about

their opinions, concerns or knowledge. It breeds contempt for

management and, worse, costly litigation in the form of

employment suits and whistleblowing proceedings.<p>



<H3>Fast, Sincere Reaction to Concerns</h3>



Let's not overlook sincerity in terms of the organization's

response to concerns raised by employees. I confess this is a

little bit redundant, but it is worth emphasizing from another

perspective. Most often, actions speak louder than words. People

need little convincing about one's intentions when they see them

graphically depicted in one's deeds. The same goes for

organizations, too. A truly effective compliance program is

characterized by compassion for those employees who raise <I>bona

fide</i> concerns in the form of a question about how to apply a

rule, or an employee who raises a concern that a violation has

occurred.<p>



<H3>Practice Drills</h3>



If you don't come from an industry that confronts material

emergencies from time to time, the notion of emergency drills may

seem foreign. Nuclear utilities undertake them routinely to

sharpen the skills of their personnel, to make certain the

emergency program works in keeping with reality and to provide

important feedback on the quality of the emergency program so

that needed corrections can be made.<p>



Why not try a practice drill to test your compliance program's

effectiveness? It doesn't have to be something elaborate. It

doesn't even have to be something that is undertaken company-wide

at the same time. Select departments or areas (especially high-

risk areas) can challenge each other to determine how the program

works in real situations, to test employee familiarity, to

identify shortcomings and to communicate them to "Compliance

Central" for consideration and follow-up.<p>



<H3>Reactive Elements And Their Relevance To Effectiveness</h3>



To this point, I have confined our discussion to proactivity as

the key factor of effectiveness.  This should not be taken as an

implication that effectiveness is in no way measured by the

reaction to incidents of noncompliance. If this were true, then

the provisions of the FSGs that consider the quality of how an

organization responds would have no meaning.<p>



Reaction is, of course, the more difficult aspect of compliance.

It comes at a time when circumstances have framed your options

for you. You may not be at liberty to take any course of action

except those that are inherently distasteful, e.g., calling up

the regulatory authorities and disclosing that someone on your

staff has violated the law.<p>



Nevertheless, the quality of reaction is an important element in

a program's effectiveness.  Though I do not place as much value

on it, this discussion of effectiveness would be incomplete

without explaining how reaction can make your program effective.<p>



Reaction needs to be genuine. Too often, the first thing that the

organization does is commission a team of lawyers to recast the

facts in a way that favors not dealing with the incident. This

creates a pattern or habit that applies to close calls and clear

violations alike.  It is distasteful to have to call one's

regulator and self-report. But if you are going to run an

effective compliance program, you need to buy into the model that

calls for decisive action when wrongdoing is discovered.  This is

the scary end of the compliance business.<p>



Consistency also plays an important role. When an issue of non-

compliance arises, assuming it is covered by the rules set by the

compliance program, then it should be resolved according to the

rules. Otherwise employees will be left asking whether there has

been a slight of hand, or how the rule is intended to apply if

not to the situation in question.<p>



As hard as this may be to swallow, the organization should be

open and honest with employees about the incident. To the extent

the employees can be provided with information, they should be

briefed (which will cause the lawyers fits). But considering your

employees are also members of the community, and if an incident

arises and is broadcast into the community, they may well be

accosted by neighbors who want to know what they know about the

incident. This is a dangerous issue to deal with, but it should

be dealt with by a program that considers itself effective.<p>



Don't transfer responsibility for the decision-making process to

lawyers. I am a lawyer myself, and so my remarks here should not

be taken as bashing. The plain fact is that lawyers should do no

more than facilitate the making of decisions. To subordinate

responsibility to lawyers for appropriate reaction is an exercise

in irresponsibility.<p>



If the culture of the organization tends toward frank, open

relations with the organization's regulators in good times, there

is no reason to alter this strategy when some adversity enters

the relationship. If you have spent lots of time creating good

relationships, rely on them when things go wrong; instead of

putting up a barrier of lawyers between you and the people whom

you tried so hard to impress with your credibility and good

intentions.  If you have a good story to tell, do so, and don't

hide information behind attorney-client privileges and work

product protection. Of course, this is a generalization. Under

some circumstances, the best defense relies upon the ability of

your lawyer to buy you time or advocate your position. But to

polarize your relationship right-off the bat without considering

the personal side of relations may cost you dearly in terms of

the end result.<p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



So, there you are, sitting hunkered down and snug in your bunker.

You are protected by the hope that when the missiles start

flying, your defensive shield will protect you and your

organization from annihilation -- or at least severe penalties,

costs and adverse publicity.  You take comfort in the fact that

you paid a lot of dollars to have some experts develop this

compliance thing for your company. Based on the experts'

reputation, you have no reason to believe that if things go sour,

it will not work as advertised.<p>



You leaf through the compliance manual at page after page of

procedures and guidelines that are supposed to be followed by

your employees if something goes wrong. Something, however, is in

the back of your mind nagging at you. <I>When was the last time we

had a drill to test the systems and see if they work as we

intended them to work? Does everyone on the team understands his

or her role in the process?</i> The nagging persists: <I>when was the

last time I went over the rules in our code of conduct? I don't

even remember the rules that apply to me and my department. I

wonder if the other members of my department are as ill prepared

as I am?</i>  Makes you feel that you have a very effective weapons

system there, does it?<p>



The fact of the matter is no program or system is worthy of the

title "effective" if it is not tested and challenged regularly to

make certain that it is designed to meet the evolving threats

that it is intended to overcome. Moreover, effectiveness begs at

the issue of how much attention you have paid to the prime

details that drive your program. Such details include risks that

your organization confronts, the culture of your organization,

the role of management in the process and its relationship with

the front-line, the appreciation for input from all members of

the team and the willingness to do the right thing even when it

is distasteful to do so.<p>



In this respect, an effective compliance program is indeed scary.

The scary part is in the realization that if things go wrong and

you have to use it, it will be distasteful -- but its use will

afford you the protection you designed it to achieve. Like a

nuclear weapon system, a compliance system is scary because it

depends upon your commitment to live with the process, push the

buttons in sequence and roll with the process no matter what.

Like a nuclear weapons system, a compliance program's

effectiveness resides in the things you hope you may never need

to test in reality. Faith in its scariness and commitment to stay

with the program are what buys you the maximum protection it can

afford.
