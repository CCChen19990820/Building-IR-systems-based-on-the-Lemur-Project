<B>PART ONE (THREE QUESTIONS):
<P>
Part One is worth a total of 80 marks. Suggested time for
the whole part is 2 hours and 25 minutes. The facts pertain to
all three questions in this part.</B>
<P>
In the not so distant past, the Federal Socialist Republic
of Yabloka (FSRY) was a multinational republic in southern Europe.
Its borders had been determined by the First and Second World
Wars. These borders fragmented many ethnic nations in that part
of Europe; among the nations in the FSRY were some that formed
a majority in the various neighbouring states. For instance, a
small number of Gusaks lived in the constituent republic of Moloka
along that republic's border with Gusakia, and, conversely, a
small community of Moloks lived in Gusakia on the other side of
the border.
<P>
Gusakia had consistently refused to accept the border with
the FSRY, with two exceptions. First, it had signed the Helsinki
Final Act, a political document that included the following principles:
<blockquote>
<b>Principle I: Sovereign Equality. Respect for the Rights
Inherent in Sovereignty</b><br>
... [participating States] consider that their frontiers can
be changed, in accordance with international law, by peaceful
means and by agreement.
<P>
<b>Principle III: Inviolability of Frontiers</b><br>
The participating States regard as inviolable all one another's
frontiers as well as the frontiers of all States in Europe and
therefore they will refrain now and in the future from assaulting
those frontiers.
</blockquote>
Second, it had acknowledged the border in its treaty with
the FSRY establishing the terms for the construction of a gigantic
hydroelectric project on the river that formed part of the border
between Moloka and Gusakia. The treaty was one of a number of
such treaties entered into by Communist states with each other
and with neighbouring states as a result of pressure from the
Soviet Union. Nervous about Gusakia's claims on parts of Moloka,
the FSRY had placed nuclear weapons in Moloka, which are still
there.
<P>
Over the last few years, the FSRY has been in the process
of disintegration as a number of its constituent republics fought
to go their own way. The constituent republic of Moloka declared
its independence in 1992. Although the Molok government has control
over the population and the territory of the former constituent
republic and a majority voted for independence from the FSRY in
a special plebiscite, recognition continues to be withheld as
a result of pressure from Gusakia a member state of the European
Union. No Western state, including Canada, has recognized Moloka.
Moloka has been admitted to the UN under a provisional name: the Former Yablokan Republic of Moloka.
<P>
Gusakia's concerns include the name Moloka and certain provisions
of the new Molok constitution. Gusakia claims that Moloka was
the name of the ancient empire of the Gusaks under Smetana the
Great and that Moloka is a name that belongs to Gusak history.
Moreover, Moloka continues to be the name of a modern province
of Gusakia. By choosing that name, Gusakia argues, Moloka is usurping
G history and implicitly laying claim to the modern province of
Moloka in Gusakia. Worse still, the preamble of the new constitution
of Moloka traces the new state Moloka to a series of resolutions
passed by an underground Molok parliament of the interwar period.
During the interwar period, the Moloks had just begun to conceive
of themselves as a separate nation, and the resolutions proclaimed
the goal of fighting for a nationstate that would unite all Moloks.
This did not come about, however, and the Moloks remained part
of the FSRY until now. The Molok constitution provides that until
all Moloks can be reunited under one state, Moloka is responsible
for and will protect all ethnic Moloks, wherever they happen to
live.
<P>
To force Moloka to change its name, Gusakia imposes an economic
embargo on Moloka. This creates enormous hardship for Moloka,
since there is fighting on its other borders and supplies can
no longer pass through Gusakia. Gusakia also closes its territorial
sea so that no ships can pass through the various straits between
Gusakia's offshore islands and the Gusak mainland, routes sometimes
taken by international shipping to reach Molok ports. Gusakia
is not a signatory to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.
It has recently extended its territorial sea to twelve miles,
which is why these straits are now entirely within Gusakia's territorial
sea. Despite protests from various maritime powers, Gusakia does
not accept that transit passage through international straits
has become part of customary law. The EU tries in vain to get
Gusakia to lift the embargo.
<P>
Moloka has explicitly accepted all treaty obligations of the
former FSRY, but Gusakia now has some doubts about the treaty
concerning the hydroelectric project. The first phase has gone
into operation with disastrous environmental results and the standards
for the remaining phases fall far short of current international
environmental standards. Moloka insists on the project because
it desperately needs the revenue from the power. Moloka also points
to the treaty as evidence that Gusakia has accepted its border
with Moloka.
<P>
The ethnic Gusak minority in Moloka did not support Molok
independence; most of them voted against it in the special plebiscite.
They were better off under the under the FSRY, where the constitution
guaranteed the equality of all citizens and provided a number
of minority rights. The Gusak minority become more militant as
Moloka restores property taken under Communism to ethnic Moloks and not to ethnic Gusaks. Next, Moloka makes
citizenship dependent on a language test, which most Gusaks are
unable to pass. Those Gusaks whose citizenship is revoked also
lose their property. The Gusaks begin a small uprising, taking
over several border towns.
<P>
Gusakia begins to broadcast to the Gusakpopulated area of
Moloka, inciting the Gusaks to seek independence, through violence
if necessary. What Gusakia hopes for is not independence, however,
but reunion of that territory with Gusakia. Even worse, it begins
to arm Gusak freedom fighters in Moloka and to train these groups
just over the border in Gusakia.
<P>
In Gusakia itself, there is both official persecution of and
a popular backlash against ethnic Moloks and they flee in large
numbers into the hills between Gusakia and Moloka.
<P>
<b>A) Worth 40 marks. Suggested time 1 hour and 15 minutes.
(Of which suggested reading time might be 25 minutes.)</B>
<P>
In the debate in the UN Security Council, the representative
of the Former Yablokan Republic of Moloka argues that Gusakia
has violated article 2(4) of the UN Charter in a number of respects.
Since Moloka effectively has a seat at the UN, Gusakia decides
not to press the point about Moloka being an unrecognized state.
Instead, the representative of Gusakia argues that Gusakia has
not violated article 2(4), among other things, because the territory
in question is lost Gusak territory. In the alternative, Gusakia
argues, if its actions do amount to intervention or a violation
of article 2(4), its actions can be justified under a number of
recognized exceptions.
<P>
Explain the arguments on both sides and advise the members
of the Security Council.
<P>
<b>B) Worth 20 marks. Suggested time 35 minutes. (Of which
suggested reading time might be 12 minutes.)</B>
<P>
The United States is conducting naval exercises in the high
seas off Gusakia and Moloka. It decides to send one of the warships
involved in the exercises through one of the straits closed off
by Gusakia to deliver medical supplies to Moloka. What arguments
can it make to Gusakia that it has the right to do so and how
will Gusakia respond?
<P>
<B>C) Worth 20 marks. suggested time 35 minutes. (Of which
suggested reading time might be 12 minutes.)</B>
<P>
You are a Canadian lawyer, and you have two clients who are
ethnic Gusaks from the border region of Moloka. They have recently
arrived from Moloka, where they were stripped of their Molok citizenship
and their family orchard was forcibly confiscated without compensation
because they were ethnic Gusaks. &quot;Unbelievable,&quot; they
say sadly, &quot;we hung onto the orchard under the Communists
and now, just as it is starting to turn a profit, the Molokan
government passes a law that lets them take it away from us just
because we are Gusak.&quot; They have heard that a shipment of
yellow plums from their orchard is about to arrive in Canada,
and they want to claim it. It has been sold to a Canadian grocery
chain that bought it in good faith from the Molokan government.
&quot;Can't this title to our plums can be challenged in court,&quot;
they ask you, &quot;After all, Canada doesn't even consider Moloka
a state. Canadian courts can't respect its actions.&quot; Advise
your clients about what the Canadian courts would be likely to
do.
<P>
<b>PART TWO Worth 20 marks. suggested time 35 minutes.</B>
<P>
What does the Spanish trawler incident demonstrate about the
nature of international law? You are not expected to make the
case for or against the legality of Canada's seizure of the trawler,
but to comment more generally. State any assumptions that you
are making about the facts or the positive international law that
applies.

1. Following the provincial budget of 1995, university tuition
fees rise sharply. A student protest is mounted with the objective of forcing the closure
of all provincial universities. At all campus libraries lines of borrowers are organized
to borrow, and to renew, every book and microform for the maximum period possible.
All telephone lines are kept permanently occupied by lengthy enquiries
on technical questions of university policy. There is a permanent line of enquirers
at every university reception office. A simple but effective rota system
(using fifteen minute sittings) ensures that all washrooms in the universities are occupied
throughout working hours. Classrooms are occupied by rotating groups from
ten minutes before until ten minutes after the times of scheduled lectures.
The tactics are very effective, and several universities have closed; all are severely
disrupted. The protesters are all registered students who claim the right to
be on campus. Consequently the municipal and provincial police forces decline
to interfere. There is a Provincial Trespass to Property Act, but its application
is doubtful, and in any event the campus police forces are too small to be effective:
when challenged with a show of force, the protesters disperse, and reassemble elsewhere.
The provincial government is sympathetic with the university authorities, but
is advised by the Attorney General's Department that no crime appears to have been
committed. Advise the Council of University Presidents.
<P>
 2. Able agrees to build for Baker a swimming pool on Baker's
property. The contract specifications call for the pool to have a depth of 8 feet at
the deep end. No provision is made for a diving board, and Baker has no intention
of installing one. When the pool is completed it is discovered that the depth at
the deep end is only 7 feet. The evidence is that the pool is perfectly safe, official
guidelines requiring a minimum depth of 6 feet where no diving board is fitted. The market
value of Baker's property is not affected by the departure from contract
specifications. Building the pool to the specifications would have cost Able $3,000
more that the actual cost, but now that the pool is complete, the only way to
deepen it would be to demolish it and rebuild it, at a cost of $50,000. Baker says
that, despite the expert assurances of safety, he would personally feel more comfortable
with the greater depth, and had specified the depth for precisely that
reason. Advise Baker.
<P>
 3. &quot;I think that the objections to allowing juries to go
beyond compensatory damages are overwhelming&quot;. Lord Reid in <cite>Cassell &amp; Co. Ltd.</cite>
v.  <cite>Broome</cite> [1972] A.C. 1027, 1087. Discuss.

<b>Question 1:</b>
<P>
About three years ago, M purchased a piece of land north of Toronto
in order to operate a helicopter business. She paid for the land
by giving the vendor $40,000 (which she borrowed from her spouse)
and giving the vendor a mortgage back for $360,000 which was to
be paid in 10 annual installments of $36,000. She then constructed
a hanger to house helicopters, and a small building from which
she intended to control the operation of the helicopters.
<P>
Helicopters must be licensed through a regulatory authority and
the licensing authority limits the number of licences issued in
order that suppliers of helicopter services can make an assured
profit. Licences are not transferable when a helicopter is sold:
however the authority usually issues a replacement licence to
the purchaser of a used helicopter. In 1993 M bought a licensed helicopter for $300,000.
The purchase price was apportioned at $200,000 for the helicopter
and $100,000 for the licence. M received the licensing authorities
permission to take a transfer of the license. Late last year
the government decided to deregulate the helicopter business and
announced that licences were no longer necessary to operate helicopters.
A number of helicopter pilots then entered the business and M's
profits dropped drastically, and she decided to get out of the
business.
<P>
Last month, M sold the helicopter for $150,000. Her agreement
with the purchaser is that she receives $30,000 immediately and
50% of the purchaser's profits from the use of the helicopter
until the remainder of the purchase price is paid. Late last
month a fire destroyed the buildings she was using, and she
sold the land for $350,000. The purchaser of the land agreed to
pay her $150,000 immediately and $100,000 a year plus interest
for the next two years.
<P>
What are the income tax consequences of these events?
<P>
<b>Question 2:</b>
<P>
The recent federal election has brought the Progress New Reform
Block Party into power in Ottawa. The Minister of Finance is undertaking
a fundamental review of the Income Tax Act. She has asked you
to prepare a memorandum concerning the tax treatment of home ownership
in Canada. The memorandum should contain an explanation of the
Act as it stands and any reasoned suggestions for reform which
she should consider.
<P>
Write the memorandum.
<P>
<b>Question 3:</b>
<P>
In 1992, Gary Grouch bought a restaurant called &quot;Mushrooms&quot;
from Sally Long for $300,000, of which $60,000 was attributable
to good will. Grouch paid Long $30,000 on closing and promised
to pay the remainder over a five year period plus interest on
the outstanding balance at the rate of 5 % per annum. The usual
interest rate for business loans of this kind at the time was
8% per annum. Grouch then sold franchises in Regina, Winnipeg
and Hamilton to three different people giving them the right to
open a Mushrooms restaurant in those cities. The franchises which
were unlimited in time were sold for $30,000 each.
<P>
The restaurant which Grouch originally bought had a very famous
chef who was obligated by contract to work full time in the restaurant
for another two years. However, the chef hated Grouch, so he looked
for a new job. He found one at the local MacDonalds. However,
Grouch was unwilling to let the chef out of the contract. Finally,
in order to obtain a release from the contract the chef paid Grouch
$8,000. To replace the chef, Grouch hired a famous Ottawa cook,
Helen Hartburn. In order to induce Helen to move to Toronto, Grouch
agreed to pay Helen's spouse, a lawyer, $10,000 to help him rent
space in Toronto. Grouch also agreed to give Helen the difference
between the purchase price of her house in Ottawa and the sales
price when she sold it to move to Toronto. Helen insists on this
clause since house prices have dropped in Ottawa over the past
three years. It turns out that Grouch gave Helen $50,000 to cover
her loss on the sale of the Ottawa house.
<P>
Alas, Grouch and Hartburn did not get along and Grouch fired her.
In the ensuing litigation, Grouch was found liable to Hartburn
for the equivalent of four months salary. His own legal fees were
$12,000, and he was liable for about 2/3 of her legal fees.
<P>
What are the income tax consequences which arise from the above
facts?

<P>
Greta Garbo owns a ten acre estate next door to the twenty acre
estate of the Wellspring Zendo Buddhist community. Wanting to
be able to expand over the coming years, Wellspring recently offered
to buy Garbo's property. She refused. Since then the commune has
admitted five new members, its current premises being large enough
to accommodate them. This brings the current number of members
to thirty. The community is in the habit of rising at 5 a.m. and
beginning the day with chanting which lasts for an hour. Garbo
has noticed that the chanting has gotten louder recently. She
is a light sleeper and not infrequently the chanting wakes her
up. (Despite the size of each estate the mansions on each property
are only two hundred metres apart.) In addition, the commune members
have recently begun to construct a fence around their property
which consists of large boards with proselytizing messages painted
in day-glo colours. Garbo finds all this very upsetting, not only
because the chanting wakes her up but because it and the fence
are a constant reminder to her of a friend who joined a cult several
years ago and whose experience both of living in the community
and of trying to leave it were so psychologically damaging that
he ended up committing suicide. Garbo seeks your advice as to
whether she can stop the chanting and get the fence removed. Outline
the relevant considerations in nuisance law
<P>
Question 2: <b><I>11 marks - 20 minutes</I></b>
<P>
Consider the principles governing assessment of non-pecuniary
damages in respect of the following three negligently injured
plaintiffs:
<P>
Jock used to be an avid amateur athlete before his accident deprived
him of the use of his legs. He used to play baseball and hockey,
as well as jogging regularly. He misses the physical activity
itself, but he mostly misses the comradery he used to enjoy through
his participation in team sports.
<P>
Spud's accident also deprived him of the use of his legs. He now
spends most of his time in front of the television checking out
the offerings on the hundreds of channels he can pull in with
his personal satellite dish. This was also Spud's main past time
before his accident. In fact, now that he has more time to spend
in front of the tube (since his disability prevents him from working
full time) he can catch some of the day time shows that he used
to miss.
<P>
Cynthia used to take an avid interest in the arts and literary
scene. She was a member of the Board of the Art Gallery of Ontario,
the Canadian Stage Theatre and the Children's Dance Theatre. Her
accident has rendered her severely brain damaged. She can get
around, although her movements are awkward, but she has the cognitive
ability of a five year old child.
<P>
Compare the non-pecuniary damage award each of these three plaintiffs
is likely to receive. Do you think this outcome is fair? Why or
why not?
<P>
Question 3: <b><i>11 marks - 20 minutes</I></b>
<P>
Should the Canadian courts extend the tort of intentional infliction
of nervous shock to cover mental distress short of nervous shock?
What difficulties do you think the courts would face in constructing
a test for liability in this area, and does the common law have
the necessary resources to meet these challenges?
<P>
Question 4: <b><I>11 marks - 20 minutes</I></b>
<P>
In <cite>Sunrise Co. Ltd. et al. v. Ship &quot;Lake Winnipeg&quot;,
</cite> two independent incidents each caused the plaintiff's ship
to run aground, necessitating dry dock repairs. The first incident
was the defendant's fault; the second was the fault of no one.
The ship was in dry dock for twenty seven days, the same amount
of time that would have been required had only the first incident
taken place. The second set of damages alone would have taken
thirteen days to repair. McLachlin J., dissenting in part, argued
that while the economic loss of having the ship out of service
for the first fourteen days should be born exclusively by the
defendant, the loss for the time the ship would have been in repair
in any event because of the second incident should be apportioned
equally between the defendant and plaintiff. In so arguing, McLachlin
J. drew support from the apportionment principle contained in
the <cite>Ontario Negligence Act, </cite>and concluded as follows:
<blockquote>
This rule conforms with the fundamental principle that the plaintiffs
are entitled to be placed in the same position as they would have
been in had the tort never occurred. It embodies all the subsidiary
rules that flow from this principle. It recognizes that the plaintiffs
are entitled only to such loss as it can prove to have been caused
by the defendant's act. It permits recognition of diminution of
the loss of use claim due to intervening causes. It restricts
the extent of any such diminution to other factors which can be
shown to have actually caused the particular detention in question.
It accords with the modern philosophy of apportioning damages
between successive causes of loss. It avoids intricate arguments
about factors such as the order of accidents, their impact on
the use of the ship, and causation. And it has the advantage of
being generally applicable to all causes and producing a fairer
result than the all or nothing approach...
</blockquote>
Comment critically on the approach suggested by McLachlin J. Is
this the best way to deal with consecutive and independently sufficient
causes?

<h3>PART II: <I>Sections A and B each contain two questions. Do all
of <U>either</U> Section A or B.</I>
<P>
SECTION A:</h3>
<P>
Question 5: <b><I>33 marks - 60 minutes</I></b>
<P>
Mr. Goodbody recently came into a small inheritance. He went to
Easi-Money Trust Company for investment advice and was advised
to place his money in a term deposit which would earn a steady
rate of return and was covered by a state run deposit insurance
plan so that his capital would be secure. Mr. Goodbody liked the
sound of this and wrote a cheque to Easi-Money. In fact, his money
was not put in a term deposit, but rather was used to finance
mortgage deals for the property developer friends of the president
of Easi-Money. A few months later, Mr. Goodbody opened up his
morning newspaper to discover that Easi-Money had gone bankrupt
and its officers had fled the jurisdiction. The newspaper reported
that for some time, Easi-Money had been diverting some of its
customers funds into a covert mortgage brokerage business. A recent
decline in property values had led several borrowers to default
on their mortgages, driving Easi-Money into bankruptcy. Upon inquiry,
Mr. Goodbody discovered that his investment had been lost. He
also discovered that money invested in mortgages is not covered
by the deposit insurance.
<P>
Mr. Goodbody seeks your advice on whether there is any way to
recover his loss. Your preliminary researches have revealed that
trust companies are governed by the <cite>Trust Companies Act, </cite>according
to which the use of deposits to finance mortgages is an unauthorized
investment rendering a company's officers liable to criminal sanctions.
The Act requires that any company carrying on business as a trust
company must be licensed by the Minister of Finance to do so.
Licences are granted on a year by year basis and may be granted
or renewed subject to &quot;any limitations or conditions that
the Minister may consistently with the provisions of the Act deem
proper.&quot; The Act also provides for the appointment of a Superintendent
of Insurance whose duties and powers are laid out in s. 47 as
follows:
<blockquote>
(1) The Superintendent shall visit personally, or cause a duly
qualified member of his staff to visit, at least once in each
year, the head office of each company and examine the statements
of the condition and affairs of each company, and report thereon
to the Minister as to all matters requiring his attention and
decision.
<P>
(2) For the purpose of such examination the company shall prepare
and submit to the Superintendent such statement or statements,
with respect to the business, finances, or other affairs of the
company as the Superintendent may require, and the officers, agents,
and servants or the company shall cause their books to be open
for inspections, and shall otherwise facilitate such examination
so far as it is in their power.
<P>
(3) The Superintendent or a duly qualified member of his staff
may examine under-oath the officers, agents, or servants of the
company for the purpose of obtaining any information that he deems necessary for the purpose of the examination.
<P>
(4) The Superintendent shall also prepare for the Minister from
the said statements, an annual report, showing the full particulars
of each company's business.
</blockquote>
Just before Mr. Goodbody made his investment Easi-Money's license
had been renewed without condition. Its head of five had been
visited by Dweeb, a junior accountant who was participating in
the annual check-up of trust companies for the first time. Easi-Money
was the last company on his list to be examined. A long weekend
was coming up and Dweeb had to get his report in by the next day
so that the Superintendent could get her report into the Minister
on time. Dweeb noticed a number of minor irregularities in Easi-Money's
books, but did not realize that they might point to a pattern
of diverting term deposits into unauthorized investments. To be
on the safe side, he wanted to question the Financial Officer
of the company about these irregularities, but was told that she
had been taken ill with a very bad flu the previous day and was
home in bed. He did examine the company President, who disclaimed
any detailed knowledge of the accounts, but said nothing to make
Dweeb suspicious. Noting that there had been no problems with
the company for the previous five years, Dweeb decided not to
further investigate the irregularities he had found, since further
investigation would have delayed his report getting to the Superintendent.
The Superintendent's report to the Minister therefore included
no warning of anything amiss at Easi-Money and the company's licence
was renewed.
<P>
Advise Mr. Goodbody as to whether he might have a cause of action
against the Crown for failing to detect the illegal practices
of Easi-Money that had led to the loss of his investment.
<P>
Question 6: <b><i>12 marks - 20 minutes</I></b>
<P>
In <cite>Tremsin v. Pike </cite>(a case not in your materials), the
plaintiff, who was employed as a farmhand on the defendant's farm,
contracted leptospirosis which he claimed was a result of the
defendant having allowed the rat population on the farm to get
out of hand. Leptospirosis is caused by contact with rat urine,
and is therefore not easily contracted. Other workers had had
different problems with the rats, a couple having been bitten.
Assuming that the defendant conceded that the rat population on
the farm was too high and he should have taken measures sooner
to bring it down, discuss the factual cause and remoteness issues
to which the case gives rise. Draw upon the case law where relevant.
<P>
<h3>SECTION B:</h3>
<P>
Question 7: <b><i>33 marks - 60 minutes</I></b>
<P>
Ima Stalker was convicted a year ago of a number of serious assaults
on his wife, Mildred Meekly, and of uttering death threats against
her. He was sentenced to two years less a day in a provincial
correctional facility. As he was being led out of the court room
following his sentencing he turned and shouted at his wife &quot;I'll
get you for this - you think you can get rid of me this easily?&quot; Stalker was sent to a minimum security
facility one hundred and fifty miles from his home town of Flavelle.
Despite his outburst in court, once incarcerated Stalker settled
into the prison routine well. He did the chores he was assigned
quietly and efficiently; he never got into trouble; he even volunteered
for group therapy for abusive men. One day the therapist, Dr.
Innerchild, noticed that Stalker was unusually quiet and seemed
fidgetty. After the therapy session, he asked Stalker whether
anything was wrong. Stalker told him that he had received a letter
from a friend telling him that Ms Meekly was dating another man.
He told Dr. Innerchild he thought she had no right to do that.
Since it was near the end of the day and Dr. Innerchild had one
more group therapy session to facilitate, he offered to schedule
Stalker for a private session the following day at 9 a.m. Stalker
agreed and left. Dr. Innerchild's last group therapy session that
day was a gruelling one, driving all thoughts of Stalker's problems
out of his head. He left the correctional facility without mentioning
his conversation with Stalker to the officer in charge. Once he
got home he thought about calling the prison, but decided that
it might be counterproductive to Stalker's therapy if the staff
were to start treating him with suspicion at just this time.
<P>
The following morning Dr. Innerchild returned to work. At 9 a.m.
Stalker had not yet appeared for his appointment. He was just
about to have him paged and ask the guards to look for him when
he got a call advising him of an emergency in another part of
the prison. He rushed off to deal with this and discovered upon
returning to his office an hour and a half later that Stalker
had not shown up for his appointment. He alerted the guards to
search the facility for Stalkers but he was no where to be found.
<P>
In fact, Stalker had escaped from the prison in the early morning
hours, intent upon seeing his wife to convince her not to abandon
him. He hitchhiked to Flavelle and made his way to the house he
had formerly shared with Ms Meekly. He broke in through a basement
window and went to the kitchen and armed himself with a knife.
Unbeknownst to Stalker, Ms Meekly was not at home, but had a guest
staying with her, Rita L'Invite, who was in the house. Having
just awakened and being unaware that there was anyone else in
the house, Ms L'Invite walked into the kitchen to find Stalker,
whom she did not know, standing there with a knife in his hand.
In her fright, she dropped the tumbler she was carrying which
shattered on the kitchen floor. Stalker grabbed her and, holding
the knife to her throat, demanded to know who she was and where
Ms Meekly was. Learning that Ms Meekly was not at home, Stalker
pushed Ms L'Invite away from him, dropped the knife on a counter,
and fled the house. Ms L'Invite fell on the broken glass, and
was knocked unconscious. She suffered several lacerations from
the broken glass, including a serious stab wound to the back inflicted
by one large shard of glass. Moments later, Ms Meekly came home
from her job where she worked the nightshift and found Ms L'Invite
in a pool of blood on the kitchen floor. Reaching for the telephone
on the counter to call 911, she did not notice the razor sharp
knife jutting out dangerously. Her forearm caught the edge of
the blade and she received a very nasty cut.
<P>
Stalker was apprehended shortly afterwards and returned to prison.
He now faces several new charges in connection with his escape
and assault on Ms L'Invite. Ms Meekly and Ms L'Invite have come
to you seeking advice on whether they can each recover for their
injuries from the Solicitor General, who is in charge of correctional facilities,
for the prison having allowed Stalker to escape. Ms Meekly says
that Stalker has no assets to speak of, and in any event, she
would not wish to further aggravate him by bringing suit against
him.
<P>
Question 8: <b><I>12 marks - 20 minutes</I></b>
<P>
The state of Florida recently filed suit against several American
tobacco companies seeking reimbursement for Medicaid costs connected
with the treatment of smoking related illnesses. Discuss, by reference
to the case law, the feasibility of such a suit in Ontario.
<P>
<hr><p>
<h3>PART III: <I>Do one of the following questions.</I></h3>
<P>
Question 9: <b><I>33 marks - 60 minutes</I></b>
<P><blockquote>
The concept of duty has sometimes shown signs of becoming an arcane
mystery but much difficulty will be avoided if it is grasped at
the outset that duty is fulfilling two functions. If we ask &quot;Is
there a duty of care not to inflict economic loss?&quot; or &quot;Is
there a duty to prevent third parties inflicting harm on another?&quot;
we are concerned with mapping out the areas in which the law of
negligence will operate and identifying those in which there are
features (fairness, practicability, risk of untoward consequences)
which suggest that the law should not give a remedy for negligent
conduct or at least should do so only to a limited extent. If
a duty does exist in this general sense then there may be an issue
on the facts of the particular case whether in all the circumstances
it was owed to the particular plaintiff....This is the second
sense of duty but if there is no duty in the first, general sense
we never get to the second question. Unless we keep this fundamental
distinction in mind we have no means of explaining those situations
in which foreseeable damage goes without legal redress.
<P>
<cite>Winfield and Jolowicz on Tort. </cite>13th edition p. 73
</blockquote><p>
Comment, illustrating your discussion by reference to the case
law. Indicate what you take to be the test or tests for duty of
care in each of these senses.
<P>
Question 10: <b><I>33 marks - 60 minutes</I></b>
<P>
On your reading of the case law, under what circumstances is it
possible for a plaintiff to shift the burden of proof with respect
to factual causation to the defendant? Under what circumstances,
if any, should this be possible?

<P>
<center><h3>QUESTION 1</h3>
<P>
<i>[One third (1/3) of total examination suggested time one (1) hour.]</i></center>
<P>
One school day, three grade nine students, Jack, Jill, and
Jason, sneaked into the chemistry laboratory, which in contravention
of school policy had been left unlocked by the chemistry teacher.
As a prank the three students each took chemicals, put them in
plastic sandwich bags, and dropped them out the window on to the
street below. Among the chemicals dropped on to the street were
combustible ones, such as red phosphorus and magnesium.
<P>
A few moments later, Francine, a seven year old child, happened
by and was attracted by the pretty packages. She took one of the
packages home and was playing with it in the kitchen of her house
when the contents of the package exploded and set the kitchen
on fire. Francine escaped from the kitchen without injury and
yelled to her parents.
<P>
The house had an alarm system that was operated by Defensor
Domus Ltd. (&quot;DD&quot;) under a contract with Francine's parents.
The alarm console in the home had a number of buttons, one of
which was labelled ''fire.'' If this button was pushed by someone
in the house, a signal was automatically transmitted over the
telephone lines to a central station maintained by DD. The person
manning the station (called the &quot;alarm monitor&quot;) would
call the fire department.
<P>
On hearing Francine's yell the parents immediately pressed
the fire button and rushed from the house. Fortunately, they were
not injured.
<P>
On receiving the signal, the alarm monitor pressed a function
key, causing the relevant information about the house to flash
on the screen of her computer. The display told her to call the
Falconer Fire Department. This information in her computer was,
however, mistaken. The house was actually in the jurisdiction
of the Flavelle Fire Department. Because of this confusion, firefighters
from the Flavelle Fire Department arrived four minutes later than
they would have if the DD had contacted them at once.
<P>
When the firefighters arrived, they saw smoke from the outside
but no fire. They accordingly decided to enter the house. However,
the fire had weakened the house's internal structure, so that
the floor collapsed, injuring Porphery, the plaintiff firefighter.
<P>
Porphyry sued the school, the three grade nine students, Francine,
and DD for his injuries. At trial the judge came to the following
conclusions:
<blockquote>
i. Although the school was negligent in leaving the lab unlocked,
the school was not liable because the criminal act of the three
students in stealing the chemicals was an intervening cause that
superseded its negligence. Moreover, the large number of causal
factors between its negligence and Porphyry's injury meant that
the injury was too remote. In support of this conclusion, the judge referred to the statement
by Andrews J. in Palsgraf that the court must ask itself whether
there was a direct connection between cause and effect &quot;without
too many intervening causes.&quot;
<P>
 ii. The three students were not liable for negligence because
it was unknown which student had thrown out the container that Francine picked up and thus
factual causation could not be proved against any of them. He distinguished Cook v. Lewis
on the ground that that case reverses the burden of proof when there are two prospective
tortfeasors, each of which has a 50% chance of having caused the injury. It does not
apply where there are more than two tortfeasors, because then each of them can prove
on the balance of probabilities that he or she did not cause the injury.
<P>
 iii. Francine was liable. Children are to be held to an objective
standard of negligence, just like the defendants in Vaughn v Menlove and in Roberts v Ramsbottom.
Alternately, if there is a special standard for children, it does not apply to
adult activities. Using chemicals is an adult activity.
<P>
 iv. DD was negligent in not having the proper information in
its computer but nonetheless was not liable for three reasons. First, DD owed a duty only to
subscribing households, not to firefighters. Second, there was no proof of factual causation
because the floor might already have been in a sufficiently weakened state even
if the firefighters had arrived four minutes earlier. The delay increased the risk of
a weakened floor, but increased risk is not the same as causation. Third, in becoming
a firefighter Porphyry voluntarily assumed the risk of injury from fires.
</blockquote>
In finding that there was no duty, the trial judge remarked:
<blockquote>
&quot;The defendant may not be in the best position to prevent
a particular class of accidents, and placing liability on it may
merely dilute the incentives of other potential defendants. In
most cases the best way to avert fire damage is to prevent the
fire from starting rather than to douse it with water after it
has started. The alarm company represents a second line of defense,
and it has no control over the first. It cannot insist that people
not leave oil-soaked rags lying about or that they equip their
houses and offices with smoke detectors and fire extinguishers.
The provider of an alarm service not only has no knowledge of
the risk of a fire in its subscribers' premises, and no practical
ability to reduce that risk (though we suppose an alarm service
like a fire insurer could offer a discount to people who installed
smoke detectors in their premises); it also lacks knowledge of
the risk of a fire to firemen summoned to extinguish it. That
risk depends not only on the characteristics of the particular
premises, but also on the particular techniques used by each fire
department, the training and qualifications of the firemen, and
the quality of the department's leadership. The alarm company
knows nothing about these things and has no power to influence them. DD would
have difficulty figuring out how careful it must be in order to
satisfy its legal obligations or how much more it ought to charge
its subscribers in order to cover its contingent liability to
firemen and to any others who might be injured in a fire of which
the alarm company failed to give prompt notice.&quot;
</blockquote>
The case has been appealed. You are working as the law clerk for
a judge on the appellate court. The judge asks you to write a
short memorandum on the legal issues. Because this may turn into
a leading case and may be much studied in the law schools of the
country, the judge wants to write a judgment that will be immune
to the carping criticism of law professors and law students. The
judge therefore wants you not only to state &quot;existing&quot;
law but to deal with any relevant issues of policy and to give
reasons for reconsidering the law's stand on any issue.
<P>
Write the memorandum.
<P>
<center><h3>QUESTION 2</h3>
<P>
<I>[One third (1/3) of total examination suggested time one (1) hour.]</I></center>
<P>
Your clients are a married couple, Mr. Schilling being 72 years
of age and Mrs. Schilling being 61 years of age. In 1990 upon
retiring, they moved from New Zealand to British Columbia to be
close to their daughter and their grandchildren. In keeping with
the practice they followed in New Zealand, shortly after their
arrival in Canada they engaged the services of an accountant,
a certain Mr. Fred Hofman, to manage their financial affairs.
<P>
As their savings became liquid in New Zealand, they arranged to
have them transferred and placed in Mr. Hofman's trust account.
Each month funds would be withdrawn to cover their living expenses
and extraordinary expenses should need arise. Their instructions
were that their money was to be held in treasury bills. They were
provided each month with a statement showing the status of their
investments.
<P>
In the early spring of 1995 after managing their affairs for some
four and a half years, Mr. Hofman absconded with all the Schillings'
savings. The police have been unable to locate him. A default
judgment for some $500,000 has been obtained against him. Nothing
has been recovered.
<P>
Mr. Hofman had been a member of the Certified General Accountants
Association (the &quot;Association&quot;) for many years. Approximately
one year before he absconded with the Schillings' savings, Mr.
Hofman had agreed to resign his membership in the Association
(thereby ceasing to be a &quot;certified&quot; general accountant)
and to refrain from applying for readmission for two years. This
resignation occurred in the midst of a disciplinary hearing in which he was being investigated for alleged breaches of the Association's
Code of Ethics and Rules of Professional Conduct. Specifically,
it was alleged that he had breached Rule 202 in that he had failed
to &quot;... safeguard the interests of clients, employers and
the general public&quot;.
<P>
After accepting his resignation, the Association did not take
any steps to ensure that Mr. Hofman was not continuing to hold
himself out as a &quot;certified&quot; general accountant nor
did it notify his clients (through a public notice or otherwise)
that he was no longer &quot;certified&quot;. It was not until
he absconded with their savings (15 months after he had resigned
from the Association) that the Schillings became aware that he
was no longer a member of the Association.
<P>
Advise Mr. and Mrs. Schilling fully and carefully as to their
legal rights.
<P>
<center><h3>QUESTION 3</h3>
<P>
<I>[One third (1/3) of total examination suggested time one (1) hour.]</I></center>
<P>
In their <cite>Public Law Perspectives on a Private Law Problem --
Auto Compensation Plans</cite>, Blum and Kalven state: &quot;While
social security provides a candid and coherent approach to the
problem of the accident victim, it leaves unanswered the common
law's main question of justice.&quot; What do you think they mean?
Do you agree with them?
<P>
Please take plenty of time to really think before (and while)
you answer this question. It does <b>not</b> call for a regurgitation
of law or other people's theories (as if that were ever called
for in an examination at this law school), but for your thoughts
about the underlying purpose of tort law in the very late 20th
century. Enjoy!

<b>Q 1. [17 marks]</B> In the case, <cite>Re Schebsman,</cite> (Page 222 of the materials),
Mr. Schebsman entered into an employment severance agreement with two companies with
which he had been employed. In return for consideration moving
from Mr. Schebsman, the companies agreed, among other things,
to make certain periodic payments to his widow or daughter should
he die within given time periods. Mr. Schebsman became bankrupt,
and, shortly thereafter, he did die, causing periodic payments
to be payable to the widow, according to the terms of the agreement.
<P>
The trustee in bankruptcy argued that payments to the widow were
equivalent to voluntary payments to her by Mr. Schebsman, and
that the demand by the trustee in bankruptcy, now standing in
Mr. Schebsman's shoes, that the payments be made to it, would
cause the widow to hold any payments received by her on trust
for Mr. Schebsman's estate in bankruptcy. (The argument is summarized
by Lord Greene M.R. at Page 224).
<P>
<B>What is the theory upon which the trustee's argument was based,
and how did the Court of Appeal deal with this argument?</B>
<P>
<b>Q2.  [25 marks]</B> Tessa's valid, homedrawn, last will named her friend, Ethel,
as her executrix, gave a substantial legacy to Ethel, and then made the following
dispositions:
<blockquote>
  &quot;I give $250,000.00 to my sister Louise, to enable her
to make appropriate provisions in accordance with my wishes for my family, as discussed between us.
<P>
All the rest of my property is to go to The Canadian Red Cross.&quot;
</blockquote>
Tessa was a childless widow in comfortable financial circumstances.
She was very close to her sister Louise, who was also a childless widow,
but who was not in such good financial position. Tessa was fond of, although often exasperated
by, her nephews and nieces, who were children of deceased siblings of Tessa.
They seemed to drift in and out of jobs and relationships, had no shame about being on unemployment
or welfare rolls, drank and partied too much, and, Tessa suspected, even
used &quot;drugs&quot; from time to time. However, Tessa always expressed hope that eventually,
they would &quot;shape up and settle down&quot;.
<P>
After Tessa died, Louise met with the nephews and nieces. She
said that she and Tessa had frequently discussed Tessa's intention to see that
Louise had no financial worries for the rest of Louise's life, and that, if Louise survived
Tessa, to leave it up to Louise to determine what part, if any, of Tessa's estate each
of them should get. Louise showed them a letter from Tessa to Louise, which had been enclosed
in a sealed envelope along with Tessa's will. Tessa had handed this envelope to Louise
shortly before Tessa's death. The letter read:
<blockquote>
&quot;Dear Louise,
<P>
Here is my last Will. As I promised you, you are now well provided
for, and I hope that you will have no qualms about spending it
on yourself. Be as selfindulgent as you like. Nevertheless, knowing
you, I expect that there will be a considerable amount left over
when you die.
<P>
Sometimes I despair of our nephews and nieces, but I like to think
there is much good in them, if any of them ever get around to
letting it come out. I want to give as much time as I can to see
what happens before dividing up my property. I leave it to you
to decide upon what share each should get out of what is left
at your death. As far as I am concerned, you can cut out any of
them who haven't shown signs of taking life seriously and responsibly.
<P>
Your Loving Sister,
<br>
&quot;Tessa&quot;
</blockquote>
Louise told the nephews and nieces that Tessa had handed her the
sealed envelope several weeks after the will was made, and just
shortly before she died. She had told Louise that what she wanted
to happen to her property was all set out in the envelope, that
the contents &quot;more or less&quot; accorded with their previous
conversations, and that she was relying on Louise to do her best
to carry them out. Louise had assured Tessa that Tessa could rely
upon her. Louise said that she had not opened the envelope until
after Tessa's death. She told the nieces and nephews that she
proposed to take Tessa's wishes seriously, and that they should
govern themselves accordingly.
<P>
A few weeks later, Louise herself died. She had never purported to
take any steps to allocate any shares of Tessa's estate among
the nephews and nieces. Her own will, made many years previously,
gave bequests to each of the nieces and nephews, and left the
residue of her estate to the University of Toronto. She also named
Ethel as her executor.
<P>
Ethel advises you that, at the time of Louise's death, none of
the $250,000. given to Louise by Tessa's will had been disbursed
to Louise or otherwise used in any way. Ethel is distraught because
she has received letters from solicitors for the nephews and nieces,
the Canadian Red Cross, and the University of Toronto, all claiming
this sum for their respective clients.
<P>
<B>If these facts were to be placed before the Court, how should
the Court direct the disposition of the $250,000. given to Louise
by Tessa's last will?</B>
<P>
<b>Q3. [18 marks]</B> In the course of his judgment in <cite>Re Rose</cite> (Page 613
of the course materials), Evershed M.R. said (at P.6  17, bottom):
<blockquote>
&quot;I agree that if a man purporting to transfer property executes
documents which are not apt to effect that purpose, the court
cannot then extract from those documents some quite different
transaction and say that they were intended merely to operate
as a declaration of trust, which ex facie they were not; but if
a document is apt and proper to transfer the property  is in truth
the appropriate way in which the property must be transferred
then it does not seem to me to follow from the statement of Turner
L.J. that, as a result, either during some limited period or otherwise,
a trust may not arise, for the purpose of giving effect to the
transfer. The simplest case will, perhaps, provide an illustration.
If a man executes a document transferring all his equitable interest,
say, in shares, that document, operating and intended to operate,
as a transfer, will give rise to and take effect as a trust; for
the assignor will then be a trustee of the legal estate in the
shares for the person in whose favour he has made an assignment
of his beneficial interest.&quot;
</blockquote>
<B>Discuss the above passage with respect to its application to
the type of legal problem which the case is addressing, and with
particular reference to the &quot;simplest case&quot; illustration
at the end of the passage.</B>
<P>
<B>Q4.  [20 marks]</b> By his last will, Terwilliger appointed Reliable Trust
Company as his executor and trustee, and gave his estate to the trust company on trust
to pay debts and funeral expenses, pay a number of legacies, and deal
with the residue as follows;
<blockquote>
&quot;9. To divide the rest and residue of my estate between
my nephew Rodney and my good friend, Sarah Smith, in equal shares. The share of Sarah Smith shall be retained by my Executor and
Trustee, and only the income thereof shall be paid or applied
for the benefit of Sarah during her lifetime. 
<p>
On the death of Sarah Smith, the capital of her share shall be paid, as a memorial
to Sarah, to the York MultiCultural Society, to advance its work.&quot;
</blockquote>
Sarah, who survived Terwilliger, has just died. Her will, made
many years ago, leaves all of her estate to her local church.
She left no family. After making this will, she was in an accident
which left her with some mental impairment. She suffered from
this condition at the time Terwilliger made his will.
<P>
Both Terwilliger and Sarah had been enthusiastic and longtime
members of the York MultiCultural Society. This is an unincorporated
organization, which generally has about 200 members. It started
several years ago as a small group of people, and has grown. It
still retains the original Constitution which had been drawn up
at its formation. The objects, as set out therein, are:
<blockquote>
&quot;To foster and maintain the existence of tolerance and understanding
between all racial and cultural groups in Canada;
<P>
To promote, by public lectures, pamphlets, books, radio, television
and newspapers, public awareness of difficulties members of each
group face when resident in Canada in areas where the language
and culture are primarily those of some other group, and to initiate
and promote proposals to alleviate such difficulties.
<P>
To sponsor social, educational or other events to encourage social
interchange and familiarity between members of diverse cultural
groups.
<P>
To promote the concept of the nation of Canada, stretching from
sea to sea, as the optimum vehicle to foster and enhance the material,
cultural, and intellectual aspirations of each cultural group
existing within its boundaries.&quot;
</blockquote>
Despite the relatively small size of its membership, the Society
has considerable money in its accounts and investments, as a result
of large gifts it had received, and continues to receive. Thus,
it has been able to carry out extensive advertising campaigns,
primarily in the English and French languages, but also in other
languages, and organize colloquia and other activities such as
multicultural receptions, far beyond the municipal boundaries
of York. Its activities have attempted to fulfill all of its stated
objects. Most of its funds have been expended for its purposes
in the most populous provinces, Ontario and Quebec, but it has
carried out some activities in other provinces and territories
as well.
<P>
Rodney has been advised by his lawyer that the gift in Terwilliger's
will to the Society is invalid, and that, accordingly, Sarah's
life interest having ended, the capital of the onehalf interest
in the residue directed to be held for Sarah for her life is undisposed
of, and passes on a partial intestacy to the next of kin of Terwilliger.
Therefore, by Ontario law, Rodney, as nearest and only next of
kin, would take all of that undisposedof share of capital.
<P>
<B>If you were a judge, and the issues raised by Rodney came before
you, should you award to Rodney the capital in that halfshare
of residue set aside by Terwillinger for Sarah for life, and then
for the Society? If not, who is entitled to receive
it?</b>
<P>
<b>Q.5 [20 marks] Answer Part A OR Part B BUT NOT BOTH</b>
<P>
<b>Part A.</b>
<P>
In the decision of the House of Lords in <cite>Boardman v Phipps,
</cite>Viscount Dilhorne (whose dissenting speech is not reproduced
in the course materials) agreed with all other members of the
House, and the judges below, that the relationship of Mr. Boardman
and of Tom Phipps to the trust was fiduciary. He said, &quot;In
my opinion that relationship arose from their being employed as
agents of the trust  and continued throughout.&quot;
<P>
Viscount Dilhorne then continued, with a passage that lies at
the core of his reasons for dissenting from the majority:
<blockquote>
&quot;It does not, however, necessarily follow that they are liable
to account for the profit they made. If they had entered into
engagements in which they had, or could have had a personal interest
conflicting with the interests they were bound to protect, clearly
they would be liable to do so. On the facts of this case there
was not, in my opinion, any conflict or possibility of a conflict
between the personal interests of the appellants and those of
the trust.&quot;
</blockquote>
<B>Discuss (a) whether it is proper to regard Viscount Dilhorne's
dissenting position as resulting merely from an interpretation
of the facts which differed from that arrived at by the majority,
or whether it should be regarded as suggesting a different approach
to the application of accepted principles, and (b) why, from the
viewpoint of a Canadian common lawyer, the answer to (a) may matter.</B>
<P>
 <center><b>OR</b></center>
<P>
<b>Part B.</b>
<P>
In the 1921 Ontario case, <cite>Re Sievert,</cite> (referred to at p.15
 16 of the course materials), Middleton J. described <cite>Tempest
v. Lord Camoys</cite> (p. 155 of the materials) as standing for the
principle &quot;that the Court has no power, save in the case
of <I>mala Aides</I> or a refusal to discharge the duty undertaken,
to put a control on the exercise of the discretion which the testator
has left to the trustees&quot;.
<P>
<B>Discuss the manner and extent to which this &quot;principle&quot;
is applied by Canadian courts when a trust beneficiary complains
of the manner in which a discretionary power has been exercised
by the trustees of that trust.</B>

<blockquote><b><I>This question is worth one third (1/3) of the final grade.<br>
Suggested time - one (1) hour</I></b></blockquote>
<P>
1. You have been asked by Country Music Television Inc. (CMT) for
your advice.
<P>
CMT is incorporated in the state of Tennessee in the United States
of America. It produces a 24 hour per day country music video
television programme service, known as &quot;Country Music Television&quot;,
which it delivers via satellite to cable television systems in
the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia.
<P>
In 1984 the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission
(&quot;CRTC&quot; or &quot;Commission&quot;) announced a policy
of authorizing the carriage by cable television systems in Canada
of certain non-Canadian satellite delivered speciality programming
services. The stated purpose of this policy was to add diversity
to the overall mix of television programming available to Canadian
cable subscribers, provided that such services did not adversely
affect the Canadian broadcasting system.
<P>
At the same time, the Commission established and published the
&quot;List of Eligible Non-Canadian Speciality Services&quot;.
By means of this List, the CRTC authorized a number of US Speciality
Services for carriage in Canada by Canadian cable systems. Among
the US Speciality Services thus authorized for carriage were CNN,
A&amp;E, The Learning Channel and CMT.
<P>
Thereafter, CMT was listed under the <cite>Cable Television Regulations</cite>
as an &quot;Eligible Satellite Service&quot;. Pursuant to the
Regulations, and by virtue of being on the List, CMT was authorized
by the Commission for carriage in Canada by any licensed Canadian
cable system which wished to make CMT available to its subscribers.
On the basis of this authorization CMT was able to carry on business
as a specialty service in Canada and enter into contracts with
those cable systems which wished to provide its programming to
their customers. By 1994 CMT reached some 1.5 million cable subscribers
in Canada and was carried on numerous cable systems under affiliation
agreements between those systems and CMT.
<P>
In 1984 the Commission had stated that in the event of a competitive
Canadian service being authorized, the non-Canadian service &quot;will
be replaced by the Canadian service. However, in 1987 this policy
was modified to state that in the event of such competition, the
non-Canadian service &quot;could be terminated&quot;. In 1993
its policy was further modified to provide that where a non-Canadian
service was partially competitive, the Commission may &quot;on
a case-by-case basis&quot; decide that such service be provided
as a pay television service and not as part of an extended basic
cable service package.
<P>
In mid-1993, the CRTC invited applications for new licences to
carry on Canadian speciality, pay television and pay-per-view
programming undertakings. In December 1993 the Commission announced the date of a public hearing to consider
applications and advised that written comments concerning the applications would have to be
received by January 25, 1994.
<P>
Among the applications to be considered by the Commission at the
public hearing were five applications for a new licence to offer
a Canadian country music speciality service. Three of the written
applications, including that of MH Radio/Rawlco, appeared to assume
the removal of CMT from the Eligible List.
<P>
CMT filed written comments with the Commission which stated its
belief that more, rather than fewer, country music video speciality
services would contribute to the development of a market for Canadian
country music artists; gave notice that it opposed any application
which would require the removal of CMT from the List, and requested
an opportunity to appear at the oral hearing.
<P>
By letter dated February 15, 1994 (the day after the hearings
had commenced) the Commission denied CMT's request to appear at
the oral hearings. The CRTC's reasons were as follows:
<blockquote>
<I>Because of the large number of requests for appearance, the
Commission has used the following criteria to assist it in selecting
appearing interventions at this public hearing:
<ol>
<li>Based on the submission filed, interveners could provide
specific information on issues that the Commission would like to explore
at this public hearing.
<P>
<li>The submission filed should provide detailed criteria for
the licensing of new services.
<P>
<li>Submissions from groups or elected officials should provide relevant specific information on the needs of specific groups they represent.</I>
</ol></blockquote>
At the time that CMT was required by the Commission to file its
written comments it did not know that its status on the List of Eligible Services would
be determined following the hearings, nor did it know that it would have no other opportunity
to address that issue. At the very early stage of the process when CMT was required to
file its written comments, it did not know whether any of the country music applications would
be approved. Moreover, it will be recalled that two of the applicants did not consider their formats
to be competitive with CMT's. Thus, CMT had no reason to believe that the Commission
was necessarily going to implement its policy with respect to competing non-Canadian services.
<P>
During the course of the CRTC's public hearing, CMT was directly
commented upon, <cite>inter alia</cite>, with respect to the content of its
programming, its impact on Canadian advertising and the attitudes
of cable subscribers to the potential removal of CMT. The Commission
itself addressed its possible removal from the Eligible List on
several occasions and applicants who did not otherwise state their
positions in this regard, were asked to do so in response to questions
from the Commission.
<P>
On June 6, 1994, the CRTC approved the application of MH Radio/Rawlco
for a licence to carry on a country music video service to be
called &quot;The Country Network&quot;. The Commission further
announced that it had amended the List of Eligible Services so
as to remove CMT from the List once The Country Network becomes
available for distribution to Canadian cable systems.
<P>
As a result, CMT will no longer be authorized for carriage by
any Canadian cable system and it will disappear from Canadian
television after ten years of operation. The cable affiliation
agreements with CMT will have to be cancelled. The 1.5 million
Canadian cable subscribers who now receive CMT will lose access
to that programming. The goodwill and name recognition built up
by CMT during ten years of servicing the Canadian cable market
will be dissipated.
<P>
The <cite>Broadcasting Act</cite> provides that the CRTC must hold public
hearings &quot;in connection with the issue of a licence&quot;,
but public hearings are at the Commission's discretion with respect
to any &quot;complaint or representation&quot;.
<P>
Leave to appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal has been obtained
under the <cite>Broadcasting Act</cite> which allows for appeal on questions
of law or jurisdiction. Advise CMT fully and carefully of its
legal rights in this matter and outline what arguments should
be made in the appeal (and with what prospects of success). Should
your advice require additional facts, indicate what they are,
and precisely how they will change your advice.
<P>

time - one (1) hour</I></b></blockquote>
<P>
2. Peter Dankworth, a founding member of the Addicted Smokers' Rights
Association {ASRA) recently applied for a job at Infobahn Inc.,
a manufacturer of interactive broadband communications devices.
The personnel manager at Infobahn agreed that he was perfectly
qualified for an opening at the company but, in keeping with a
long-established hiring policy, once Dankworth revealed that he
was a smoker, his application was immediately rejected.
<P>
Infobahn Inc., a privately held company, is the brainchild of
Dieter Prinz, an engineer who emigrated from Germany to Canada,
who is a self-proclaimed fanatic about health matters.  His own life is governed by a spartan regime of
self-denial. He expects his employees to take their health very
seriously. The company policy is not to hire any persons who are
smokers or at overweight. In the company cafeteria, health foods
are subsidized, herbal tea is free and coffee unavailable.
<P>
When pressed on his hiring policy in the past, Prinz has explained
that he offers his employees and their families very extensive
supplementary health benefits and he saw no reason why those who
could not be bothered to look after their health should be subsidized
by those who did. In any event, a healthy work force was a productive
work force, and in an era of global competition, only the fittest
would survive.
<P>
Peter Dankworth, with the support of ASRA, lodged a complaint
with the Provincial Human Rights Commission. The Human Rights
Code provides:
<blockquote>
5(1) Every person has a right to equal treatment with respect
to employment without discrimination because of race, ancestry,
place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex,
sexual orientation, age, record of offences, marital status or
handicap
</blockquote>
Dankworth and ASRA contended that nicotine addiction had now to
be recognized as subjecting smokers to a handicap. They argued
that it was irrational to recognize drug and alcohol addiction
as possibly creating handicaps (as the Commission has in fact
done) but refuse to recognize nicotine addiction for similar purposes.
<P>
After an investigation as provided for under the Code, the Commission
decided not to proceed further with the complaint. After reconsideration,
the Commission again indicated that it would not act on the complaint.
The Code further provides:
<blockquote>
37(3) Every decision of the Commission on reconsideration together
with the reasons therefore shall be recorded in writing and promptly
communicated to the complainant and the person complained against
and the decision shall be final.
</blockquote>
In its statement of reasons, the Commission indicated that the
burden of proof was on the complainant to show that nicotine really
was addictive, and, if addictive, that it would create a &quot;handicap&quot;
under the Code. The Commission also noted that the Addiction Council
did not treat nicotine on a par with drugs or alcohol and that,
in any event, common sense suggested that smoking was not in any
real sense addictive. ASRA believes that the Commission gave virtually
no weight to the scientific evidence of the addictive nature of
nicotine which they had submitted. They concede that such evidence
might not be conclusive, but they insist that it should at least
have been taken seriously.
<P>
Two days after announcing its decision with respect to the reconsideration,
the Human Rights Commission held one of its regular public consultation
sessions in its &quot;The Commission Listens&quot; series. On
this occasion, Dankworth asked, in a forceful tone, why the Commission
&quot;... had refused to do anything about discrimination against addicted
smokers such as myself.&quot; The Commission's Chair, after consulting
briefly with members of her staff, replied, &quot;I know who you are.
You want us to drop everything else and spend all our time on
a minor problem (probably self-induced) when we have much more
serious issues to deal with. Get real. We have a very limited
budget you know&quot;.
<P>
Advise Peter Dankworth fully and carefully of his legal rights.
As ASRA is well funded and fully supportive, a major legal challenge
seems likely. Should your advice require additional facts, indicate
what they are, and precisely how they will change your advice.
<P>

3. Your senior partner has approached you for your help in preparing
a paper for an upcoming legal education conference. She indicates
that part of the paper will deal with continuing issues in jurisdictional
control in administrative law. She readily concedes that it has
been many years since she systematically studied the subject in
law school and she feels that, as you have been fortunate enough
to have studied administrative law very recently you can easily
update her understanding of what the courts are doing in the name
of jurisdiction.
<P>
She is particularly concerned that she cannot recall what the
nature of the difference had been &quot;... between Wilson and
Gonthier in that corngrowers' case. Hadn't they agreed with respect
to the outcome? Was it just a judicial spat or was there really
something of substance to it? How would you articulate their difference
and explain its importance? In any event, hadn't Dickson said
it all in <cite>Jacmain</cite> when he had said something about the
intractable difficulty being that someone <b>had</b> to determine what
limits were to be placed on any administrate tribunal's jurisdiction?
Isn't it not just a matter of working out what the rule of law
and our notion of limited government require? That shouldn't be
too hard, should it?&quot;
<P>
Being a humane senior partner, she has given you the whole weekend
for your task. However, she suggests that in the hour before
the firm's Christmas Party you might wish to map out your initial
response for her to have a look at. Oblige her.

<h2>ANNUAL EXAMINATIONS. WINTER 1994<br>
BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS I<br>
EXAMINER: PROFESSOR MACINTOSH<br>
INSTRUCTIONS</h2></center>
(1) This is a take-home examination. It must be picked up between 9:30 A.M-12:30 P.M.
on Dec. 21, and returned within 24 hours (unless special arrangements have been made with
me).<p>
(2) There is only one restriction on the materials you may use. Because not everyone can have simultaneous access to library materials, I would prefer that you not use anything from the library collection. Previously taken photocopies do not violate the letter or spirit of this rule.<p>
(3) In accordance with the Faculty Council resolution of Oct. 6, 1993, you may consult with other students in the course of working out your answer. However, please note that this resolution also provides that &quot;the answer or answers returned by the students must be organized and written by that student alone&quot;.<p>
(4) There is only one question. Note carefully that there is a word limit of 3500 words for the whole exam. <b>Anything which you write in excess of 3500 words will not be read.</b> Be forewarned that this penalty will be enforced with absolute strictness, in fairness to those students who make a conscientious effort to observe the word limit. In the past, I have downgraded at least one &quot;A&quot; paper to a &quot;C&quot; for significantly exceeding the word limit, and have downgraded many more a half or a whole grade. I make word count estimates for every paper: you should make your own word count estimate and <b>put this on the front of your answer.</b><p>
(5) I would prefer that you type your examination answer. However, this is not required. If you write your answer, <b>please</b> make sure that it is legible, and written on <b>every other line.</b> If you choose, you may submit a handwritten copy of your answer and later submit a typed copy. Because of the late date upon which the examination is being written this year, and the fact that the law school is closed over the Christmas vacation, you may bring in a typed copy when school reopens after the Christmas break. However, if you intend to do so, please mark in a clearly visible place on your handwritten copy, &quot;TYPED COPY TO FOLLOW&quot;.<br>
Typewritten copies of already submitted exam answers will be checked for accuracy against the handwritten original. If any part of your handwritten copy is illegible, then the typed part which corresponds with that part <b>will not be read.</b> If anything of substance appears in the typewritten copy which does not appear in the handwritten original, your exam will not be read, period.<P>
(6) I place a high premium on <b>organization and clarity</b>. Answers which have been well thought out and well organized typically receive a higher grade.<P>
(7) You may feel that in answering the question you sometimes
have to cover the same material twice. Rather than repeating yourself,
feel free to incorporate by reference part of your earlier discussion
<P>
(8) You need deal only with those issues raised in the course!
<P><hr><p>
1. Napoleon Mastiff and Bull Mastiff (who are twins) are great
dog fanciers. So much so that they decided that their life's work
would be with dogs. Toward this end, in 1971 Napoleon and Bull
incorporated Togs for Dogs, Inc. under the CBCA.
<P>
Togs for Dogs makes various clothing items for dogs, including
winter jackets, rain gear, Japanese kimonos, leather biker suits,
and bathrobes. Togs for Dogs' retail outlets also offers dog grooming
services for dogs, and sell various dog-related products like
pet food, dog toys, and various dog paraphernalia. While this
might sound a bit wacky, Napoleon and Bull have actually made quite a go of it. Their dog outfits are a great hit with the dink (&quot;double-income no kids&quot;) set, many of whom like
to browse for bowser while the latter is busy bagging a shampoo
and a trim. Togs for Dogs has actually become so successful that
several wholly-owned subsidiary corporations have been set up
in Canada, the U.S., Europe, and Asia to market Togs for Dogs'
products.
<P>
Initially, there were four shareholders in the company. These
were Napoleon and Bull, and their two brothers, Lank and Harry.
Napoleon and Bull each owned 34 voting common shares (carrying
one vote each), while Lank and Harry each owned 16 shares. All
four brothers were directors (and they were the only directors).
However, Lank and Harry took little part in the business. They
occasionally gave business advice, but otherwise left the running
of the business up to Napoleon and Bull. In 1971, upon
incorporating the company, the board appointed Napoleon and Bull
the &quot;co-Chief Executive Officers&quot;. In fact, proper corporate
formalities were not always observed. Between 1973 and 1985, no
shareholders' or directors' meetings were held. The management
of the business was conducted informally, with Napoleon and Bull
always consulting each other before any major business decision
was taken.
<P>
Over the years, as the business began to prosper, Napoleon and
Bull both had families. Napoleon and Bull each had one child,
named Josephine and Eleni respectively. Brothers Lank and Harry
also had one child each, named Cassandra and Hero respectively.
Napoleon and Bull were concerned about ensuring that the business
would be properly cared for in the years following their departure.
Thus, they decided that it would be a good idea to bring their
children, as well as those of Lank and Harry, into the business,
allowing them to gain management experience. To this end they
set up the following structure in 1985. Each of the four brothers
gave 16 shares to his offspring (who in total thus hold 64 shares).
A subsidiary corporation, Togs for Dogs Corp., was created under
the OBCA. All of the assets of Togs for Dogs Inc. were transferred
to Togs for Dogs Corp. in return for the issuance of 10 shares
of Togs for Dogs Corp. to Togs for Dogs Inc. For convenience,
Togs for Dogs, Inc. will be referred to below as &quot;Holdco&quot;,
and Togs for Dogs Corp. will be referred to as &quot;Opco&quot;.
<P>
The by-laws of Holdco provided that up to 6 individuals could
be elected as directors. In the event of a tie, the Chair of the
Board would have a casting (or deciding) vote. The shareholders
of Holdco then unanimously elected Napoleon, Bull, and the four
offspring as the directors of Holdco. Eleni was elected Chairwoman
of the Board.
<P>
The by-laws of Holdco also provided that the chief officers of
Opco should be selected by the Opco board. However, all appointments
of individuals as Opco officers were required to be approved annually
by the board of Holdco.
<P>
All of the shareholders of Holdco also signed an agreement which
stated that Holdco would use its power as sole shareholder
of  Opco to compel Opco to pay all of its net profit (i.e. after
payment of all expenses, salaries, etc.) to Holdco. The agreement
also provided that all of this profit would be distributed annually
to the directors of Holdco, by way of directors' fees.
<P>
Note that no changes were made to the outstanding share certificates
of Holdco at the time of the reorganization.
<P>
Pursuant to the by-laws of Opco, the board of Opco consisted of
5 individuals. The bylaws also stated that all senior officers
must resign at age 65, except Napoleon and Bull, who were eligible
to serve as officers until the age of 75.
<P>
Acting as sole shareholder of Opco, Holdco (pursuant to a Holdco
board resolution signed by all of the directors of Holdco)
appointed Napoleon, Bull, and three outside directors to these
five board positions. The Opco board then appointed Napoleon and
Bull as co-CEOs of Opco. The co-CEO appointments were approved
by the Holdco board. Opco also signed employment contracts with
Napoleon and Bull stipulating that Napoleon and Bull should serve
as co-CEOs until their retirement at the age of 75, subject to
the Opco articles, by-laws, and any unanimous shareholders' agreement.
<P>
The four offspring were each appointed to managerial positions
within Opco, or one of the various wholly-owned operating subsidiaries
of Opco. In particular, Josephine was appointed CEO of Togs for
Dogs U.S.A. Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Opco. Eleni was
appointed CEO of Togs for Dogs Europe Inc., another wholly-owned
subsidiary of Opco. Cassandra was appointed Chief Operating
Officer of Opco, while Hero was appointed Chief Financial Officer
of Opco.
<P>
All went well for a time. The business was booming and everyone
seemed to get on well together. Then a problem started to develop.
Napoleon and Bull were both about 70 years old, and would soon
be retiring. Napoleon wanted to ensure that his daughter, Josephine,
would eventually become CEO of Opco. When the position
of CEO in Opco's Asian subsidiary (Togs for Dogs Asia Inc.) became
vacant, Napoleon appointed Josephine to the position, without
(in departure from past practice) consulting Bull first. Bull
was very angry about not being consulted, eventually acceding
only grudgingly to the appointment so as not to disrupt relations
with suppliers and customers.
<P>
Bull started to become worried that Napoleon would do everything
in his power to ensure the succession of Josephine to the job
of CEO of Opco, even if this was not in the company's best interests.
In particular, Napoleon seemed to be spending an inordinate amount
of time lobbying the various offspring as to Josephine's suitability
for the job of CEO of Opco. Bull thus spoke to the four offspring and convinced them to pass amendments
to the by-laws of Holdco. The amendments (which were approved
by the shareholders of Holdco in December 1991, with only Napoleon
and Josephine dissenting) provided that henceforward, the identity
of the CEO of Opco (or co-CEOs) was to be determined by a committee
of the three independent directors of Opco. The by-law also provided
that the independent directors' committee was to immediately hire
a firm of independent management consultants, which was to be
charged with the responsibility of determining the identity of
the best CEO (or co-CEOs). The independent committee was required
to implement the recommendation of the management consultants.
<P>
The by-law also provided that it could be amended only with an
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all of the shareholders of Holdco.
<P>
Following the adoption of the by-law, the board of Holdco met.
The directors of Holdco (with Napoleon and Josephine again dissenting)
passed a resolution (which they called the &quot;Sole Shareholders'
Resolution&quot;) repeating the content of the by-law and requiring
Opco to follow it. A copy of this resolution was sent to the Opco
board.
<P>
Following the above events, the independent committee of Opco
was struck, and the committee hired a firm of management consultants
who proceeded to develop identify the best CEO(s) for Opco. In
particular, the consultants began a process of interviewing all
of the top contenders for the job, including Napoleon, Bull, all
of the offspring, and a number of outsiders. They also interviewed
suppliers, customers, and others who had dealings with the company,
to determine who would be best suited for the CEO job.
<P>
In the meantime, however, things went from bad to worse between
Napoleon and Bull. Following Napoleon's unilateral action in appointing
Josephine CEO of the Asian subsidiary, Bull had ceased
to consult Napoleon on important business decisions, and Napoleon
stopped consulting Bull. Eventually, the two brothers stopped
talking altogether. The company began to suffer, as neither
employees, suppliers nor customers knew who was really in charge.
While both brothers refrained from countermanding decisions made
by the other, it was clear that cooperation had vanished and that
the company was suffering as a result.
<P>
Unfortunately, the management consultants hired by the independent
directors' committee had not yet made its final report
on succession. The Holdco board, however, felt that to avoid damage
to the company, they had to act immediately. By a majority
(with Napoleon and Josephine dissenting, of course), the
Holdco board passed a resolution (which they titled &quot;Sole Shareholders' Resolution&quot;) instructing the Opco board to immediately remove Napoleon as co-CEO of the company.
The Opco board (with Napoleon alone dissenting) did this. Napoleon shortly thereafter wrote a stinging letter to the board, claiming that he was entitled to serve as co-CEO until age
75, and that if he was not reinstated immediately, legal action
would follow.
<P>
Shortly after these events, another crisis developed. Gordon Setter,
a well-known takeover artist (a/k/a &quot;raider&quot;)
started to approach various Holdco shareholders with a view to buying their shares in Holdco. Since Holdco has no restrictions on the transferability of shares, this greatly alarmed Bull, who feared that some of the offspring
(and perhaps Napoleon) might be tempted to take the very generous
offer being made by Setter, ultimately giving control of the company
to an outsider. He realized that Setter would pump much-needed
funds into the company, and might even improve its profitability.
He was nonetheless determined to prevent Setter from getting control, not only because he found Setter personally distasteful (after all, the man had cats for pets), but because he
regarded Togs for Dogs as a family business whose character would
be irrevocably changed should an outsider gain control. He also
feared for the employees of Togs for Dogs, given that Setter had
a reputation for ruthless cost-cutting and was not above getting
rid of employees to enhance the bottom line.
<P>
Bull was able to convince his daughter, Eleni, as well as his
niece, Josephine, to vote in favour of an amendment to the by-laws
of Holdco providing that any sale of a share of Holdco would result
in a diminution of its voting power to 1/10 of what it was before
the sale. Thus, for example, should Hero sell his shares
to Setter, they would carry only 1/10 of a vote per share after
the sale. Indeed, under the by-law, if Setter was then to sell
the shares again, each share would carry only 1/100 of its original
voting power. While Bull made known to Eleni and Hero (but not
the other shareholders) his views about Setter, and his desire
to keep the business in the family, Eleni and Josephine voted
in favour of the amendment simply because they thought that Setter
was not a suitable person to run the business. Could someone who
owned cats really be expected to understand the needs of dogs?
They doubted it. All of the other shareholders voted against the
amendment.
<P>
Bull was also able to convince the Holdco board to pass a resolution
adopting a &quot;poison pill&quot; plan which provided that should
any person acquire more than 48% of the shares of the company,
all of the other shareholders (i.e. not including the shareholder
holding 48% or more) would have the right to buy, at a designated
price (which was about one-half of a share's true value) one new
share for each share held by that shareholder. The resolution
stated that the pill could be redeemed (i.e. rendered inoperative)
pursuant to a two-thirds resolution of the directors of Holdco.
The resolution was passed by a two-thirds majority of the board,
with Napoleon, Bull, Josephine, and Eleni voting in favour, and
Cassandra and Hero against. In the discussion preceding adoption
of the pill, Bull disguised his reasons for voting in favour (which
were the same as his reasons for voting for the by-law amendment,
above). Instead, he argued that the pill would result in an enhanced
premium for a sale of control of the company. Napoleon voted in
favour because he was considering selling his shares, given the
events that had transpired, and, persuaded by Bull's logic (and
despite his personal antipathy for him), thought that the pill
would result in a more attractive offer from Setter. Josephine
and Eleni voted in favour for the same reason that they voted
in favour of the amendment to the by-law noted immediately above.
<P>
Despite the adoption of the pill, Cassandra and Hero decided to
sell their shares to Gordon Setter, but made their sales conditional
upon the poison pill being declared invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction. Now realizing that Bull was bluffing, and would
never vote in favour of redeeming the pill for any acquiror (nor,
very likely, would Josephine or Eleni), Napoleon also decided
to sell his shares to Setter, on the same condition as stipulated
in the sales by Cassandra and Hero.
<P>
Setter, Cassandra, Hero, and Napoleon have now applied to the
court for a ruling that the poison pill is invalid. Setter has
also announced that if he does acquire control of the company,
he will engage in spirited cost-cutting to improve the profitability
of the company. In particular, he has stated that he will reduce
worldwide employment by the Togs for Dogs family of companies
by about 25%, and will introduce a line of products for cats.
He has also stated that he wants to end the system under which
all of the profits paid as dividends to Holdco are distributed
as directors' pay. In particular, he has stated that he will use
a share of the profits generated by Opco to embark upon an aggressive
expansion program. The remaining profits will be paid out as dividends
to Holdco as before, but then they will be distributed to Holdco
shareholders by way of dividends, with only nominal consideration
(e.g. $500 per annum) paid to each of the directors of Holdco.
<P>
Please discuss any relevant legal issues, indicating any potential
causes of action (including the identity of the plaintiff(s)),
their probable resolution, and probable (or possible) remedy.

<p>
Allied is a large, diversified retail company that is publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The company owns a number of different retail chains in major shopping malls across Canada. The company is incorporated under the OBCA. From relatively modest beginnings at the turn of the century, Allied enjoyed great prosperity, generating a record $50 million in profits in fiscal year 1991 alone. In 1991, the company was run by Ryan Stone and his daughter, Alexandra. There are eight directors on the board: Ryan, Alexandra, Eva Stone (Ryan's wife), Andrew Draper (the company's lawyer), Mark LeBlanc (the company's accountant), Pia Bruni (the CEO of a major book publishing company, which is also a supplier of Allied's), Jan Turner (the manager of Allied's clothing chains) and Roberta Sanders (a leading Canadian corporate law academic).
<p>
The company's current problems relate to a series of problems that began after the company announced its record profits in 1991. In January 1992, Ryan (who is CEO of the company) and his children started discussing Ryan's retirement, as well as the company's long term plans. Given that Ryan was then in his mid sixties, he was anxious to slowly wind down his affairs at the company, and spend more time golfing and travelling with his wife. Ryan wanted to ensure an orderly transition, and he also wanted to find a way to get some money out of the company, given that the bulk of his investments were represented by the 51% of the company's voting shares he owned (no other family members held <I>significant </I>shareholdings in the company). The remainder of the shares were held widely held by the public.
<p>
After extensive discussions, Ryan decided that he would retire at the middle of 1992, and that Alexandra would be CEO. The whole notion of retirement spurred Ryan and Alexandra to take stock of the company's good fortune, and, in particular, to acknowledge the loyalty and commitment of its public shareholders. To express their appreciation to the company's shareholders, Ryan and Alexandra decided to create and to issue as a dividend a new class of voting shares (Class A multiples), which would only be made to those shareholders who had continuously held the company's common shares for a period of 10 years or more. The shares would have the following attributes:
<.blockquote>
(i) each share was entitled-to 3 votes (as against the one vote for each common share),
<p>
(ii) each share would be entitled to a dividend but only after the dividend was paid on the company's existing common shares, and
<p>
(iii) the shares' multiple votes would terminate upon the sale or transfer of the stock to any non-family members. At that point, the shares would become non-voting.
</blockquote>
Given that there were only a handful of shareholders in the company other than Ryan who could meet the eligibility requirements for the dividend (all of whom had relatively trivial holdings), Ryan knew that the creation of the dual class share structure would increase considerably his voting power. As a consequence, he would be able to sell a portion of his existing common shares to the market so as to raise the funds needed for his retirement but, of course, without losing his voting control.
<p>
The board of directors approved the plan after retaining the services of a noted investment banker, J.D. Rosen, who advised that the share issuance was consistent with prevailing business practices in Canada. Thereafter, the dual class share structure was put to the shareholders for a vote, and it was endorsed by more than 50% of the shares voted at the meeting (including the Stones'). After all the dust had settled, Ryan ended up with 68% of Allied's votes, while owning 20% of the common shares of the company .
<p>
At the same time that the dual class structure was approved by the board, Alexandra proposed, and the board agreed, to award her father with a lifetime pension of $500,000 per year. The pension was in appreciation for the tremendous contribution that Ryan had made to the corporation over his 40 years of service. The pension was not, however, a complete surprise to Ryan; his father (who founded the company) also received a life time pension on his retirement).
<p>
Soon after Ryan's retirement, the fortunes of the company began to plummet (as is so often the case when heirs get control of companies). As it turns out, once her father left the corporation, Alexandra became much less focused on the corporation, preferring to party all night rather than worry about the company's economic performance. Complicating matters was the bad managerial advice she and the board were given by long time advisors to the corporation. It was generally known that in the wake of the Free Trade Agreement, many large U.S. retailers would be expanding into Canada, and would be interested in entering markets in which Allied had long been the dominant retailer. Alexandra's advisors (all of whom were experts in the company's various business lines) told her that the best way to meet this threat was to streamline the company's diverse activities by focusing on the downscale consumer market. The strategy was approved by the board of directors and was implemented through a costly conversion ($200 million, largely financed by junk bonds) of the company's existing upscale stores to more budget oriented retail outlets. Unfortunately, however, by the end of 1992, it was clear that Allied had grossly exaggerated consumers' appetite for low scale goods, particularly in the wake of the rebounding Canadian economy, and the company reported a record loss of $30 million.
<p>
By early 1993, Alexandra realized that she had to do something dramatic to turn around the company's fortunes. She decided to look for a manufacturer that could produce an in-house brand of products at lower cost than they could get from existing name brand vendors. The idea was to create a long term venture with a manufacturer so as to make for a more integrated and responsive system of production and sales.
<p>
Alexandra spent the first quarter of 1993 investigating alternative suppliers. She narrowed the list down to two candidates, Peermore Ltd. and Global Inc. Peermore had a fairly innovative product line and cheap production costs, but insisted that- any long term relationship between Allied and Peermore be cemented by a sizeable ($5 million) equity investment in Peermore by Allied. Global's product line and costs of production weren't as good as Peermore's, but it was prepared to supply the in-house brand to Allied at its cost in return for half the profits made by Allied on sales of the goods supplied.
<p>
Given the deteriorating fiscal position of Allied, the board decided in March 1993 to go with Global. When Alexandra informed Peermore of the decision, Paul Pearson, the president of Peermore, suggested that perhaps the Stone family would be interested in investing personally in the company given the likely success of the new clothing product Peermore was developing -- a stitchless men's suit line (seams would be glued rather than stitched -- a far less labour intensive manufacturing process). Pearson told Alexandra that he would have be more than happy to give Allied &quot;a piece of the action&quot; in the venture had it made the equity infusion in accordance with the earlier proposal, but since it didn't, he would &quot;let the Stones in on the ground floor&quot;.
<p>
In light of the ongoing problems at Allied, Alexandra was able to convince her father to invest (personally) in the new venture. The Stone family ended up with 50% of the voting shares of Peermore. Stone's investment in Peermore was extremely fortunate because the company's product turned out to be wildly profitable.
Nevertheless at Allied, things went from bad to worse. To start, the relationship with Global was beset by serious problems. <B>After </B>the agreement with Allied-was formalized, but before one product was shipped, a fire broke out in Global's premises, killing 10 employees. Soon after, the company was embroiled in litigation relating to claims made by unpaid suppliers and by the families of the deceased employees. Just before the company declared bankruptcy in August 1993, Allied loaned it $500,000. Out of desperation for house brand products, Allied entered into a long term contract with Peermore in September 1993 (the value of the contract did not exceed, however, 258 of Allied's market capitalization). The directors' approved the contract in an emergency meeting. All of the Stone family members on the board declared they had an &quot;equity interest of significance in Peermore&quot; (but nothing more).
<p>
Exacerbating the company's problems was growing shareholder dissent. Several dissident shareholders, including Fairlyvested, a company that represents institutional investor interests, began to clamour for changes to the company. Fairlyvested decided to launch a just vote no campaign for the November 1993 annual shareholders meeting. Fairlyvested communicated its concerns respecting the company's dismal performance to a number of other large institutional shareholders. However, recognizing that they lacked the votes to oust the Stones or their designates, the aspiration was simply to create public embarrassment for the company and hopefully jolt the outside members of the board to action. As well, the dissidents hoped to stop the high level of excessive compensation being paid to Alexandra ($750,000 per annum Pursuant to a 3 year employment contract).
<p>
Fearing the embarrassment from such criticism at a time when the company required additional funds from outside banks, Alexandra decided to delay the scheduled annual meeting until mid January 1994 (the last meeting was in November 1992). As well, they decided to move the meeting from Toronto to Kenora to coincide with the opening of new bookstore. The locational change threw the dissidents off balance, and their embarrassment campaign failed. Allied's proposed slate of directors to the board were easily reelected.
<p>
In the midst of all of this turmoil, J.D. Rosen, the investment banker, approached Ryan about selling his shares in the company to an outside investor in the hope that the company's fortunes could be revived. Despite his loyalty to Alexandra, Ryan was a shareholder like any other, and he was less than pleased about the losses he had sustained on his Allied shares. He agreed to arrange the sale of all of his common shares in Allied, as well as shares held in Allied by his wife, Alexandra, and shares he held in trust for his three grandchildren, to a suitable bidder. As a condition for sale, however, Ryan insisted that Alexandra's management contract be extended for a further 3 year period and that he be permitted to purchase one of 6 of Allied's retail chains for a 20% discount on fair market value (before the company ran into difficulty it generated about one third of the company's profits).
<p>
Within two weeks, J.D. found a buyer, Country Lane Inc., that was willing to meet Ryan's terms. The buyer agreed to purchase Ryan's (and the family's) common shares for $5 per share (at the time of the purchase Allied's common shares were trading at $2). However, in exchange for the premium, Ryan agreed to &quot;throw in&quot; his Class A shares. Also, because of the staggered nature of the board (shareholders can only elect one third of the directors each year), Ryan agreed to arrange the seriatim resignation of the board members so that Country Lane could get its board nominees elected as soon as possible.
<p>
No sooner was the sale completed (June 1994), when KKZ, a New York LBO Fund, decided to make a bid for all of the company's shares. They reasoned even if Country Road (a 21% voting shareholder after the acquisition of the Stone's shares) didn't tender into the bid, the company's remaining shareholders probably would. Before, however, the bid was actually made, the new directors of Allied adopted a flip-in/flip-out poison pill, stating that this was necessary to preserve the company's distinct culture and organizational identity. The directors pledged to just say no to all takeover bids, no matter how significant the premium. The directors also decided to issue common shares in the company to the company's employees (amounting to 15% of the existing voting shares) on the basis that the new Allied would need to have the backing of the company's employees if it were to have a chance at succeeding in the company's turn around. However, to demonstrate the board's concern for shareholder interests, it fired Alexandra, noting that a bylaw existed which limited the company's ability to enter into long term management contracts.
<p>
Obviously, there are a number of legal actions raised by this sordid set of events. Please identify each of the potential causes of action, and discuss the remedies and merits of each.
<p>
<B>Question 2 (Total -- 30%)<br>
Suggested time for question: one hour.<br>
Pick one of the following two essay questions to answer.</b><p>
2 (A)<p>
One of the distinctive features of the Canadian corporate law regime is the much greater role played by securities regulators in the administration of Canadian corporate law than is played by securities regulators (meaning the Securities Exchange Commission) in the United States. Several commentators have criticized the expansive role of regulators into corporate law, arguing that it undermines both the certainty of the legal environment and increases the costs of administration. However, other commentators believe that the role of securities regulators in corporate law has strengthened the quality of the regime, reducing costs to dissident shareholders and ensuring a more timely and expert resolution of corporate disputes. Based on the materials and the theory covered in the course, evaluate this debate.
<p>
2 (B)
<p>
The province of Ontario has retained you to advise on the desirability of adding the following provision to the OBCA:
<blockquote>
The Articles of Incorporation ... may lawfully contain any or all of the following matters:
<p>
(7) A provision eliminating or limiting the personal liability of a director to the corporation or its shareholders for monetary damage for breach of fiduciary duty or of oppressive conduct, provided that such provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct of a knowing violation of the law; or for any transaction in which a director derived an improper personal benefit.
</blockquote>
Please comment on the implications and advisability of this provision .

1. Jake has come to you for advice. Two and half years ago he was fired from a special
contractual position with a Minister in the Ontario government. His employment contract had
provided that he could only be dismissed with &quot;good causes and if he was terminated without
good cause, he would be entitled to a year's salary.
<P>
There is no dispute that Jake was fired because he missed two
important breakfast meetings with the Minister, but assume that
it is an open legal question what &quot;good cause&quot; means
and specifically whether it incorporates protections from the
Ontario <cite>Human Rights Code</cite>.
<P>
Jake had trouble sleeping especially when he had to work late
and be in early the next morning. Jake told his co-workers at
the government about his trouble sleeping especially when required
to work late, but attributed this problem to a combination of
nerves and laziness. On the nights in question, Wake had to work
late into the evening, had trouble sleeping, only began sleeping
at dawn and slept through his alarm.
<P>
A year ago, on the advice of someone he met at a party, Jake went
to a medical specialist who diagnosed him with chronic fatigue
syndrome. She is prepared to testify that this condition constitutes
a physical disability which is a prohibited ground of discrimination
under the <cite>Ontario Human Rights Code</cite>. The doctor has also
stated in a letter written to you as Jake's attorney that there
is a 75% chance that Jake's particular condition could have been
accommodated by having regular work hours. The doctor finds it
significant that two other people have recently left the Minister's
staff because of the long and irregular hours.
<P>
Assume that the relevant <cite>Limitation Act</cite> provides that proceedings
based on Jake's contractual rights shall be commenced within 2
years after the cause of action arose while there is no statute
of limitation for making complaints under the <cite>Ontario Human
Rights Code</cite>. Also assume that the human rights commission
has a three year backlog and subjects all complaints to an early
settlement initiative which relies upon mediation before a formal
investigation or adjudication. If proceedings are commenced in
the Ontario Court (General Division), assume they will be assigned
to a case management judge responsible for dealing with all pre-trial
matters.
<P>
Jake has not found employment since his termination and his unemployment
insurance has run out. After Jake on his own initiative
wrote the Minister stating that his doctor believed that with
regular work hours he would be cured, the Minister offered $20,000
(a third of Jake's yearly salary) to settle on the condition that
Jake renounce all legal claims and agree not to make the terms
public. The Minister has warned Jake that if he &quot;goes public&quot;
on this matter, the Minister will be forced to make public Jake's
employment and attendance records. Jake is very concerned that
this not happen because he may have a lead on a new job.
<P>
Jake needs the money but he also believes strongly that he was
treated unjustly and wants to make a point so that employers
will accommodate others with his condition. Advise Jaake a to the strengths and weaknesses of the various dispute resolution options before him and what role that you as his lawyer can play
in the various processes.

You are a member of the Flavelle bar recently hired as an associate
by a law firm in Wrightsville. Another associate with the firm
has just come into your office and said the following to you.
Set out your response, complete with analysis and relevant authorities.
<P>
<hr>
<P>
The judge at the trial in which I am one of the counsel has just
adjourned for the day. It's a case arising out of the dissolving
of a long-time business partnership between the plaintiff and
my client, the defendant. There are allegations of the client's
secret profits and fraud--some of the details of which, the client
has told me, are true. Fancy stuff!
<P>
Unfortunately, the judge seems to have it in for my client. Half-way
through my examination-in-chief of the client as a witness, the
judge began asking a lot of questions, leaving me standing
there unable to get a word in edge-wise. Then, just before adjournment,
he told me that, unless I lead some evidence to fill in some gaps
in my case, he will consider calling the accountant who
prepared the tax returns for the partnership
<P>
I am not sure how I should handle this judge. I telephoned a former
law school classmate who has a flourishing litigation practice
down the street, told him about the case and what the client
has told me and asked for his thinking. But I'm not satisfied
with his advice. What do you say?
<P>
On second thought, maybe I should not be unhappy with what the
judge is doing. After all, he's stretching out the trial, and
by turning into a four or five day affair what looked earlier like a three-day trial, I will be able to bill a nice extra
bundle to the client at my $250 hourly rate.

In 1984 Professor Patrick J. Monahan of Osgoode Hall Law School
began an article, entitled &quot;At Doctrine's Twilight: The Structure
of Canadian Federalism&quot; (34 UItT 47) in the following words:
<p>
Do not go gentle into that good night,<br>Rage, rage against the
dying of the light.<br>
Dylan Thomas
<blockquote>
Canadian constitutional law and theory lingers at the dusk of
legal formalism. The suggestion that judges decide cases through
the application of logic or language alone has become an object
of ridicule and parody. It is now common ground that, in at least
some cases, the legal materials do not dictate any uniquely correct
answer. Yet the modern scorn for &quot;mechanical jurisprudence&quot;
should not lead one to suppose that the formalist theory of adjudication
is of historical interest alone. The pervasive, albeit implicit,
assumption that continues to underscore contemporary constitutional
analysis is that the judge can deduce a single right answer in
at least some, if not all, constitutional disputes. The barrier
between law and politics may have been streamlined but it has
not yet been shattered. To employ H.L.A. Hart's framework, there
may be a penumbral area of hard cases in which the jurist has
discretion, but in the core or &quot;plain&quot; case the jurist
simply deduces the correct result by applying the existing legal
rules to the facts presented. In short, formalism's dusk may be
upon us, but the imagined darkness of the realist night has not
yet arrived.
<P>
This essay is intended to complete the inconclusive rebellion
against the formalist impulse. The central argument is that, within
the sphere of Canadian federalism, it is impossible to draw any
meaningful distinction between doctrinal and political discourse.
The choices confronting the constitutional adjudicator are ultimately
indistinguishable from those of the political actor. The argument
does not depend on the claim that language has no meaning. Nor
does it deny that federalism doctrine has an intelligible content
and that it is possible to make &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;
arguments based on that content. Rather, the central thesis advanced
is that conventional &quot;legal&quot; arguments of this sort
are insufficient to resolve the issues posed by federalism disputes.
Of course, conventional arguments may often give the appearance
of demanding certain results and precluding others. But this is
only because of an arbitrary refusal to recognize or understand
the fills implications of such arguments. If one were prepared to elaborate
skilfully and resolutely the implications of the conventional
legal arguments that are made in federalism cases, one would ultimately
be confronted with mutually incompatible outcomes. The choice
between these outcomes would depend on one's normative commitment
to a controversial and provisional theory of federalism, rather
than anything inherent in the conventional legal arguments themselves.
</blockquote>
With reference to the cases you have read this term, do you think
Professor Monahan's position is defensible or not?

<p>
This test deals with the regulation of taking and using blood for medical purposes - a topic that has been much in the news lately. 
<p>
Medical patients, typically patients in hospitals, often need blood transfusions. At present, this blood is supplied by the Red Cross, a private, non-profit organization with seventeen local divisions across the country. Each division seeks donors, screens them, takes blood, tests it, and supplies it to hospitals - usually hospitals in its immediate locality. The divisions sometimes transfer blood among themselves, but there are very few transfers between divisions in different provinces or between Canada and other countries.
<p>
There are some risks in transfusions, especially the risk that a donor may have a disease that can be transmitted in the blood. Screening of donors and testing of blood are needed to limit this risk. Extensive records are also needed; for example, if a patient is infected by a transfusion, the donors of the blood he or she received must be traced; or if a donor who has given in the past turns out to be have a transmissible disease, the donations he or she gave in the past must be traced.
<p>
At present, both the federal and provincial governments regulate taking and using blood, although you need not know anything about the particular structures and terms. A few years ago about a thousand people who received transfusions were infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and in response, a public inquiry was established to investigate the blood supply system. The witnesses at this inquiry have testified that the current regulatory arrangements are unsatisfactory, and that substantial reforms are urgently needed. They claim that responsibilities are vague; standards are inconsistent and perhaps inadequate; and supervision is erratic. A witness in November said, &quot;one governing body would be able to react more quickly to a crisis,&quot; and another said, &quot;There's a parasite in South America that's not here yet, but we're not ready for it.&quot;
<p>
Assume that the federal government plans to enact legislation establishing unified and comprehensive regulation throughout the country. Licences will be required for all organizations that are part of the blood supply system, and a new regulatory agency will be established, with comprehensive powers and responsibility. It will grant the licenses, set standards (for example standards for taking and testing blood), and monitor compliance (for example, by making inspections). The penalties for violations of license requirements and standards will include loss of licenses, fines, and imprisonment. As well, the agency will establish a nation-wide records-keeping programme, which will keep track of all donors, and all uses of donated blood. Each hospital and each organization will be obliged to give the appropriate information.
<p>
You can assume that the Red Cross will continue to be the major supplier of the blood, and, of course, it will be required to have a license under the proposed legislation and comply with the standards. So will any organization that seeks to perform the same function. As well, assume that some private entrepreneurs plan to establish a service that permits individuals to store their own blood. For a fee, they will take blood from an individual, store it, and return it to the individual (and only that individual) upon request - presumably when it is needed in some emergency. This business, too, will be governed by the requirements in the proposed legislation.
<p>
Does the federal government have power to enact this legislation? Consider only the division of legislative powers, and do not worry about any Charter problems that may occur to you. The facts have been simplified for the purposes of this test, but if you think more facts are needed, describe them, and, if you wish, make some reasonable assumptions.

<h3>QUESTION</h3>
Able is considering an addition to his house. Baker, a building
contractor, sends Able a &quot;quotation&quot; specifying the
work to be done to construct the addition, and stating a price
of $50,000. The specifications refer to &quot;six-foot windows&quot;.
At the bottom of the page appear the words &quot;I accept this
quotation&quot;, and a space for Able's signature. Able, who has
always enjoyed interior light, strikes out &quot;six-foot&quot;
and substitutes &quot;eight-foot&quot;, signs in the space provided,
adding, &quot;N.B.: eight-foot windows essential&quot;, and sends
the document to Baker. Baker replies by letter, &quot;I will do
my best to get eight-foot windows, if available&quot;. Nothing
more is said about windows, and Baker starts work. It turns out
that eight-foot windows are not available for delivery in time,
and Baker completes the work using six-foot windows. Able is angry
and distressed and finds himself unable to enjoy the new room
because his mind dwells constantly on the reduced light. Expert
evidence is that most potential buyers of the house would find
the light in the new room perfectly adequate, and that replacement
of the windows (which would cost $15,000) would add nothing to
the value of the house. Advise Able.

Asa's only aunt, whose name is Zita, is owner of a small photocopying
business in Truro. Over the years it has been quite successful.
Asa is fluently bilingual and three years ago obtained a diploma
in translation from a college in France. Zita is very fond of
Asa and thought it would be a very good idea if Asa could come
home to Truro and set up a translation services firm. As a result,
three years ago Asa set up shop in Truro offering English/French,
French/English translation services to the local business, legal
and college communities. Asa was of the opinion that many people
in the local community would require document translation services.
Zita told Asa that she (Zita) will &quot;back him up&quot; in
setting up his business.
<P>
Asa had his high school pal and now local lawyer, Bobby Snook,
draw up a standard contract which Asa will use in his new business.
As part of starting up the new translation service Asa thought
it would be a good idea to offer his new customers free photocopies
(&quot;unlimited - up to a maximum of 100!&quot; as he put it
in his advertising three years ago) of the translated document.
Zita promised to keep her word to help Asa by providing the photocopying
services free of charge to Asa.
<P>
Among Asa's first, and now regular, customers are the professors
at the local Agricultural College. Asa has developed a reputation
as a translator of scientific papers on agricultural subjects.
Over the first three years of business every time there was work
to be done Asa and the college professor concerned exchanged and
signed a copy of the contract which Bobby Snook had drafted -
they all thought this was a sensible business practice. However,
Asa never got around to cancelling the &quot;one time only start
up offer&quot; of free photocopying services. The &quot;free copies&quot;
had given Asa a bit of an edge over competing translation firms.
As a result the college professors and other customers have continued
to receive up to 100 free photocopies of their translated papers.
This is very useful for the professors, particularly when preparing
papers for conferences, and they were always taken 100 copies.
<P>
In September 1994 Asa contracts with Professor Billy MacIntyre
for translation of his most recent paper (entitled &quot;The Barns
of Colchester County&quot;), a paper Professor MacIntyre was to
present at a conference sponsored by the Agricultural Ministries
of France and Canada and to be held at the College in Truro. At
such conferences it is a professional courtesy, bordering on a
duty, to have the paper available in translation as the paper
is being delivered orally. Professor MacIntyre is somewhat late
finishing his paper and takes it to Asa who promises to do the
translation in time.
<P>
On the morning that Professor MacIntyre was to deliver the paper
Asa showed up as promised with the translated version, but without
the 100 free photocopies Professor MacIntyre was expecting. It
was about ten minutes before Professor MacIntyre was to deliver
his paper to the Conference. When Professor MacIntyre protests,
Asa tells Professor MacIntyre that he should read the contract
he signed - which in fact does not mention free photocopies at
all.
<P>
The reason Asa has stopped providing free photocopies is that
Zita's photocopying business had very recently suffered severe
setbacks due to the invasion of Truro by a low cost national photocopying
chain known as Kinky's. Just two days before the conference Zita
had to stop performing free photocopying for Asa. Asa was very
disappointed and worried about the impact of this upon his business.
<P>
Professor MacIntyre is mortified by the prospect of delivering
his paper without the translated version for his French guests.
He was sure that the paper would garner him an invitation to Paris
to attend a follow up conference on &quot;The Psychology of Truffle
Hunting Pigs&quot;. In fact, he had promised his wife the trip
to Paris and had prepaid both of their air fares. Shattered by
these events Professor MacIntyre does not deliver his paper, is
not invited to the follow up conference, and sees his doctor who
prescribes medication because of his inability to sleep.
<P>
Fully and critically evaluate the contractual position of these
parties.
<P>

<h3>QUESTION</H3>
Derek Lindross was a very accomplished junior league hockey player who was widely thought to have outstanding prospects as a professional player in the National Hockey League. He had been strongly encouraged throughout his childhood in his hockey endeavours by his father, who had coached him personally and coached a number of
the teams on which he played. After turning 18 years of age and
prior to the National Hockey League draft for junior players,
Derek Lindross and his father had extensive verbal discussions
over how his professional hockey career could best be promoted
and managed. His father proposed to him that he should act as
Lindross' manager and agent, both in negotiating salary arrangements
with the team who drafted him and any subsequent teams to whom
he might be traded or by whom he might be employed, as well as
product endorsements with equipment manufacturers and other commercial
parties with respect to endorsements. His father proposed that
he be paid 20 percent of all net revenues realized by Lindross
from all sources in return for his father's promotional and agency
efforts. Father and son agreed that this arrangement would obtain
throughout Lindross' playing career. Lindross agreed to this arrangement,
but suggested that it might be wise to have a prominent Toronto
law firm review the arrangement and work out all the details and
put it in a formal legal document. He asked his father to take
care of this but it was never done.
<P>
At the National Hockey League draft, Lindross was drafted by the
Quebec Patriotes, but Lindross' father advised Lindross not to
report to the Patriotes out of a concern that he would not be
able to maximize his endorsement value in the Quebec market, and
suggested that he sit out the season until the Patriotes agreed
to trade him to another team. During the season, Lindross continued
playing hockey with a European hockey team, and at the end of
the season was reluctantly traded by the Quebec Patriotes to the
Boston Bombers with whom Lindross' father negotiated a record
contract for a rookie. Following the negotiation of this contract,
Jack Lindross proposed to his son that his percentage of net revenue
be raised from 20 percent to 30 percent to which Derek Lindross
agreed. However, relations between father and son shortly thereafter
deteriorated sharply, with Derek Lindross complaining that his
father was attempting to dominate every aspect of his life and
compromise his independence, and terminated the arrangement with
him on the advice of Alan Beagleson, a well-known hockey agent,
who proposed that Lindross sign with him as his agent, which Lindross
did. Jack Lindross now has brought a suit against Derek
Lindross for breach of contract, and an action for the tort of
inducing breach of contract against Alan Beagleson. In the action
against Derek Lindross, Jack Lindross seeks an injunction preventing
Derek Lindross from signing with any other agent, and in the alternative,
expectation damages, reflecting the commission that Jack Lindross
expected to earn over the course of Derek Lindross' professional
playing career. Jack Lindross claims that he has devoted all his
time to developing his son's career and has no other clients.
Derek Lindross retains you to advise him on preparing a defence
against this action. Provide him with a legal opinion.

 Seated one day at his multi-media PC, the accused, Thomas Term, was browsing through Internet when he was intrigued to see something labelled <i>ped.porn@mjaw.sask</I> which he logged on to. In response
to PASSWORD, he entered <I>tom.term@tor.ca</I> and was rewarded by a series of pictures depicting a young lady, nude and  in various forms of explicit sexual activity with a number of young males. To his relatively untrained mind, she looked about 21, but as he admits, his mind was not really focused on her age, though it is conceded as a fact by the prosecution that the young lady depicted did,  indeed, look about 21. He downloaded the pictures on to his hard drive, where they now reside in the form of meaningless bits and bytes which, at the
touch of a button or two can be reconverted into graphic images.
<P>
Unfortunately for him, the police have had their eye on <I>ped.porn@mjaw.sask</I> for some time and, under a duly authorised search warrant, have entered its premises and seized both its stock and list of subscribers, including
the name of Thomas Term. The young lady who appears in the pictures downloaded by Term has been located and identified and is discovered to be Maybelle Brown, aged 16. Acting, again under a duly authorised search warrant to which no objection is made, they enter Thomas Term's apartment and discover the downloaded programme on his computer.
<P>
Terms now is charged, under s. 163.1 of the Code with possession of child pornography. What issues do you see arising from this scenario and how would you resolve them?

Sally left her husband, Tom, and went to live with Frank. Tom
thought that if he could scare Frank into breaking up with
Sally, she might come back to him. So he wrote several letters to Frank, telling him that if he didn't tell Sally to leave, &quot;something bad&quot; would happen to him. When this
failed to work, Tom decided on bolder measures. He tied a small
explosive to a detonating device and placed it in a box. He so
arranged matters that opening the box would trigger the
detonator. He then wrapped the box, addressed it to Frank, and
deposited it in the mail.
<P>
Four days later the box arrived at Frank's house. Frank opened
it and the bomb exploded. The blast was not strong enough to kill
Frank directly, but it caused an overhead light fixture to fall
on Frank's head. The impact would not have been fatal to an ordinary
person, but Frank had a brittle skull, which cracked when the
fixture hit it.
<P>
By the time Frank arrived at the hospital, he was very nearly
dead. An encephalograph detected no brain activity, although Frank
still had a faint pulse. Provincial law defines death as brain
death and requires certification of such a state by two doctors
before any vital organs are removed. However, the doctor on duty,
on being informed that Frank had willed his vital organs
for transplant purposes, decided to forgo this procedural detail.
He put Frank on a respirator that kept his lungs and heart operating
while he removed Frank's liver and kidneys. He then turned off
the respirator. A few minutes later, Frank's heart stopped beating,
and shortly thereafter he was officially pronounced dead.
<P>
On hearing of Frank's death from the police, Tom admitted that
he had sent the mail-bomb. But he said that he had only wanted
to scare Frank into breaking off his relationship with Sally.
<P>
Discuss Tom's criminal liability.

1.	There had been three auto thefts in Falconer City, a small town with a population of
5,000. In a search for suspects, the police ran criminal record checks on most of the people
in town. Police notes in your possession indicate that the police discovered that Ben had three
prior convictions for auto theft and that he lives with his younger brother Jerry who, to the
police's knowledge, has no prior convictions.
<P>
A police officer posing as a fence for stolen cars phoned Ben.
Jerry answered and told the undercover officer that Ben was away
for a few weeks but that he was Ben's younger brother and could
he help. The officer then explained that he could get a good price
if Jerry could obtain a certain type of car. Jerry said he was
not in the car business and hung up.
<P>
The next day, the officer phoned back and he and Jerry went out
for coffee. At this meeting the officer explained that Jerry could
make an easy $20,000. Jerry was reluctant at first but became
more interested when the undercover officer showed him some money
and indicated that if Jerry did not do the job, he would have
to ask some big city car thieves who would probably Muscle&quot;
his brother out of town.
<P>
The undercover officer told Jerry that the car was kept unlocked
in a covered car port that adjoins a specific house. The house
was owned by a vacationing police officer who had given her permission
to use the carport but not the actual house for the sting operation.
Jerry went to the house and walked into the carport (which did
not have a garage door) where he was seized by police officers.
They searched his pockets and found a tool commonly used to hot
wire cars. They then asked him why he had the tool and he replied
&quot;to hot wire the car&quot;. At the station, Jerry was advised
of his right to counsel, phoned a lawyer and made no further statements.
Jerry has been released and is likely to elect for trial by judge
alone but with a preliminary hearing.
<P>
You are articling for the Crown Attorney who hopes to introduce
both the tool and the statement. She requires a memorandum outlining
possible issues that the defence is likely to raise and their
likely resolution if Jerry is prosecuted for being unlawfully
in a dwelling-house with intent to commit theft in violation of
s.349(1) of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>. Note that &quot;dwelling
house&quot; is defined in s.2 of the Code and &quot;curtilage&quot;
means an enclosed space immediately surrounding a dwelling house.

<p>
For some time, the police, under the direction of Sgt. Scud, have been investigating what they believe to be a ring smuggling illegal weapons into Canada. They have had a house under surveillance at 126 Sparkhall Avenue which they believe to be the headquarters of the operation. On several nights over a three week period, they have observed a man drive to the house around 7:30 p.m., take several bags out of his car, and deliver the bags to the occupants of the house. The transactions were always completed quickly.
<p>
On the morning of December 8, 1994, Sgt. Scud received orders from his superiors that the investigation has gone on long enough and that he was to move in on the smugglers immediately. That same morning he obtained a warrant on reasonable and probable grounds to search the house (under s. 487 of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>) which he and his fellow officers proceeded to execute without delay. The officers arrived at 126 Sparkhall at noon. To their surprise and delight, as they were making final preparations before entering the house, the man whom they had observed making nightly deliveries drove up to the house. &quot;Bonus,&quot; said Sgt. Scud, &quot;we'll be able to search this smuggler as well. We can search the guy under s. 101 of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>. &quot;
<p>
Before the man had even had time to leave his car, Sgt. Scud and another officer, P.C. Cruise, approached the car, informed the man they were police officers and that he was under arrest. P.C. Cruise informed the man of his right to counsel while Sgt. Scud began searching the car. Sure enough, there were several bags on the passenger seat of the car similar to those the man normally delivered in the evening. Sgt. Scud seized the bags and, without opening them, handed them to Detective Stealth, a firearms expert. Sgt. Scud proceeded to search the glove compartment of the car where he found several small glass vials containing white powder. &quot;Well, well, what have we here,&quot; thought Sgt. Scud, &quot;let's see what our man has to say about this.&quot;
<p>
Vials in hand, Sgt. Scud walked over to where P.C. Cruise was standing with the suspect. &quot;Did you read him his rights?&quot; Sgt. Scud asked P.C. Cruise. &quot;Yes sir,&quot; P.C. Cruise replied, &quot;but he hasn't asked for a lawyer. Oh, I've got his name. Its Mr. S.&quot; &quot;Well Mr. S.,&quot; said Sgt. Scud, &quot;what can you tell me about this white powder?&quot; Mr. S. shook his head and said nothing. &quot;What's this, you exercising your right to silence,&quot; said Sgt. Scud, &quot;you sure you don't want to speak to a lawyer?&quot; Again Mr. S. shook his head and said nothing.
<p>
Sgt. Scud began questioning Mr. S. to see if he would say something. Mr. S. gave a number of replies, but as the questioning proceeded it became clear that his command of English was minimal at best. After about ten minutes of questioning, Mr. S. admitted that he had the vials &quot;to help extra money.&quot; Sgt. Scud charged Mr. S. with possession of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to s. 4 of the <cite>Narcotic Control Act</cite>.
<p>
Just then Detective Stealth interrupted. He had just opened the bags seized from Mr. S.'s car and discovered they contained take-out food. As it turned out, Mr. S. was not a firearms smuggler after all, but a refugee claimant who worked at a nearby fast food restaurant from which the smugglers frequently ordered. Mr. S. knew little about the Canadian legal system, and answered Sgt. Scud's questions because he was afraid of the police.
<p>
You are Mr. S's defence lawyer. What arguments would you make on his behalf?
<blockquote>
For your information, s. 101 of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> provides:
<p>
101(1) Whenever a peace officer believes on reasonable grounds that an offense is being committed or has been committed against any of the provisions of this Act relating to prohibited weapons, restricted weapons, firearms or ammunition and that evidence of that offense is likely to be found on a person, in a vehicle, or in any place or premises other than a dwelling-house, the peace officer may, where the conditions for obtaining a warrant exist but, by reason of exigent circumstances, it would not be practicable to obtain a warrant, search without warrant, the person, vehicle, place or premises, and may seize anything by means of or in relation to which that officer believes on reasonable grounds the offense is being committed or has bean committed.

<P>
Alessandro was charged with manslaughter, and was tried by Tamiri
J. sitting without a jury. Tamiri J.'s decision was as follows:
<blockquote>
The accused Alessandro and the victim, his dear friend Agenore,
were both 20 years old and had grown up as members of a small
religious group, based in Haliburton, who call themselves &quot;The
Children of Ice.&quot; One of the central tenets of this group
is that fire is an instrument of the Devil: they never use any
cooking or heating device that has an open flame, nor do they
ever have matches, or any other implement that could be use to
create a flame, in their houses. Early in 1994, Alessandro and
Agenore decided to leave the Children of Ice. They moved to Toronto,
where they were unable to find a job or a place to live. Ultimately,
having run out of money, they moved into an abandoned house on
Charles Street. Agenore was unaccountably attracted to the street
life of Toronto, and had begun smoking crack cocaine; Alessandro
retained the aversion to flames instilled in him by his childhood
religion and would have nothing to do with Agenore's habit.
<P>
On the night in question, Alessandro was going to sleep while
Agenore was smoking his nightly crack. Alessandro awoke some time
later and observed that Agenore's mattress was in flames, but
that Agenore himself was nowhere in sight. Afraid to approach
the flames, Alessandro left the house to look for Agenore. Unfortunately,
as it turned out, Agenore was in another room in the house. He
would have had ample time to escape but, befuddled by the crack,
he was unable to perceive the danger he was in, and was killed
when the fire spread from the mattress and burned the house down.
<P>
I find that Alessandro committed an arson offense as defined in
s. 433 of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>, in that he recklessly caused
damage by fire to property, which fire caused bodily harm to Agenore.
Since this unlawful act caused Agenore's death, Alessandro is
guilty as charged.
</blockquote>
Section 433 of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> reads as follows:
<blockquote>
433. Every person who intentionally or recklessly causes damage
by fire or explosion to property, whether or not that person owns
the property, is guilty of an indictable offense and liable to
imprisonment for life where
<blockquote>
(a) the person knows that or is reckless with respect to whether the property is inhabited or
occupied; or<br>
(b) the fire or explosion causes bodily harm to another person.
</blockquote></blockquote>
Alessandro's conviction was affirmed by the Ontario Court of Appeal, and he has been granted leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. You are the lawyer in the Crown's office responsible for drafting the Crown's factum. Write a memorandum to your file, outlining the submissions the appellant is likely to make and your best responses. Be sure to indicate your opinion as to whether the appeal will succeed.

<h3>QUESTION</H3>
AB and CD are third-year undergraduate students at the University of Tronville. During orientation week for incoming first-year student they met EF, who they found to be a rather naive person from a religiously devout rural family. As a prank designed to give him instant exposure to the sins of the big city, they decided to trick him  into going to a bar in an inexpensive hotel where provocatively
dressed prostitutes are known to gather to meet prospective clients.
Hotel rooms are accessible through a connecting door from the
bar, and are reputed to be available at hourly rates.
<P>
One Saturday in late September, AB and CD invited EF to join them at a late night movie, showing him that they had a third ticket for a performance starting at 11:00 p.m. They suggested they all meet at 8:30 p.m. that evening to go for a snack and a few beers first, and EF agreed to join them.
<P>
EF was taken to the hotel bar. After about an hour, sitting at
a table having a second bottle of beer, EF asked if many
people in Tronville dress like some he had seen in the bar. AB
and CD laughed, and told EF what they knew about the premises.
EF felt uncomfortable, but said that he appreciated the experience
of having been shown that type of place. After another 15 minutes,
EF said that he would like to leave, and the three got up
and approached the door to the street. Before they reached it,
however, uniformed police entered the bar, detained all those
present, and noted their names and addresses.
<P>
AB, CD and EF have now been charged with the summary offense of
being found without lawful excuse in a common bawdy-house, contrary
to s. 210(2)(b) of the Criminal Code.
<P>
Explain how you would undertake the defense of AB, CD and EF,
and what legal principles apply to the arguments you would use.

<P>
Jones is a well-known criminal lawyer who was having an
affair with Mrs. Smith. While the two were walking along a frozen
river, Mrs. Smith fell through the ice. Jones fled and told nobody
about the incident. Miraculously, Mrs. Smith was able to pull
herself out of the river and crawl to a nearby cabin, where
she phoned for an ambulance. She was treated in the hospital for very
severe frostbite and as a result, both her arms and one foot were amputated.
<P>
She told the police about Jones' callous conduct. They asked him 
to come to the station. When he arrived, the detective said, &quot;I
don't have to tell you your rights; what happened?&quot; Jones admitted
the facts and said, &quot;Of course, I had no duty to assist her.&quot;
The detective said, &quot;We'll see,&quot; arrested Jones and booked
him for attempted murder.
<P>
While Mrs. Smith was recuperating at home in Toronto, she became
terribly depressed about her condition and persuaded her husband
to obtain and administer a large quantity of sleeping pills. She was
discovered several hours later by a neighbour, who had a key to
her apartment and was rushed to the Toronto Hospital where
she remained in a coma. Mr. Smith was arrested and charged with attempted murder.
When he was arrested at the apartment, the police found an empty bottle
of sleeping pills in the bathroom cupboard, which they can show that
Mr. Smith purchased.
<P>
About eleven months after Mrs. Smith fell through the ice, she
remained in a coma in Toronto. She was not considered &quot;brain
dead&quot;, but could remain in a coma for months or even years. The
police approached her attending physician, Dr. Green, to suggest
that they (the police) could see nothing wrong with the doctor
giving her a fatal injection of drug &quot;X&quot;. The doctor
did so and she died. Dr. Green was charged with first degree
murder, and the attempted murder charges against Mr. Jones and Mr. Smith
were changed to charges of first degree murder.
<P>
You are an articling student in the Crown attorney's office in
Toronto. Lawyer Jones has offered to plead guilty to failure to provide
necessaries if the murder charge is dropped. Mr. Smith is willing
 to plead guilty to a charge under s. 245(b) (administering
noxious thing) if the murder charge is dropped. Dr. Green is willing
to assist the Crown by telling of an incriminating conversation he had
with Mr. Smith (who admitted to him that he administered the pills) if
the murder charge is dropped.
<P>
Advise the Crown attorney what you think she should do in <b>each</b>
of the three cases.

<hr>
<p>
54 Minutes <B>Question 1:</b> 30 marks (5 marks for each part)
<P>
(a)	Your client is charged with keeping a common gaming house. What modes of
trial are available?
<p>
(b)	Walking home one night you witness a sexual assault in a park. Can you
arrest the perpetrator? If he escapes and runs to his home how could the
police lawfully arrest him?
<p>
(c)	Your client is a terrorist who hijacks a bus full of tourists in Ottawa and
drives it to Montreal where he demands the release of colleagues being held there in jail. When his demands are
refused he releases the tourists, drives the bus to upstate New York and blows it up with dynamite. He is charged with kidnapping and forcible confinement of the tourists, attempted extortion of the jail authorities and mischief to the bus. Where can these Charles be laid?
<p>
(d)	The accused is charged with the break and enter of a dwelling house. The evidence at the preliminary inquiry discloses that the accused took a set of car keys from the house during the break and enter and proceeded to steal the car that was parked in front of the house. What options are available to the Crown to have a charge of theft auto added?
<p>
(e)	Describe the two &quot;golden rules&quot; of criminal pleading. Explain the advantages and disadvantages of pleading detailed facts.
<p>
(f)	Your client is charged with an indictable offense and, since he is in custody, you elect trial in Provincial
Court and plead not guilty. On the morning of trial the judge is impatient with the police and the Crown for
failing to bring the prisoners into court in an orderly and timely fashion.
The judge dismisses the charges and leaves the courtroom before the accused has been brought up from the cells.
What remedies are available to the Crown ?
<P>
54 Minutes <b>Question 2:</b>30 marks (10 marks for each part)
<P>
(a) Your client, Don Johnson, is charged with conspiracy to traffic cocaine. He has no criminal record and no outstanding charges. He comes from a stable middle-class Toronto family and his parents are supportive. Since graduating from the University of Toronto ten years ago he has not had any apparent employment in Canada. He has travelled a great deal in Mexico, Columbia and the Caribbean and the police can connect him to a number of suspicious holding companies in the Cayman Islands which do not appear to conduct any business and whose assets are kept secret by the banking laws of that jurisdiction.
<P>
Discuss the likely outcome of Don's bail hearing. Can the Crown
question Don at the bail hearing about his recent travels? Can
the defence call Don's accountant at the bail hearing to provide
an innocent explanation for the Cayman holding companies and to
describe their lawful business?
<P>
 (b) Worldwide Television Corporation (W.T.C.) seeks your legal advice concerning a search warrant that the police executed on their newsroom in Vancouver after the Grey Cup Parade. Extensive damage was done to downtown businesses during the parade by vandals. The warrant seeks:
<blockquote>
&quot;...all videotapes in the possession of Worldwide Television
Corporation taken by its camera crews in Vancouver during the
time period of the Grey Cup Parade.&quot;
</blockquote>
The information supporting the warrant is sworn by officer Frank
who sets out a detailed account of the various mischief offences
committed during the parade. His information then swears:
<blockquote>
&quot;...I have reasonable and probable grounds to believe videotaped evidence of these offenses may be found in the newsroom of Worldwide Television Corporation&quot;.
</blockquote>
You are advised by W.T.C. that their camera crews observed the police conducting their own extensive video surveillance of the parade. What advice will you give W.T.C.?
<p>
(c) Your client is charged with a complex fraud. It takes the police and the Crown 9 months to prepare the disclosure materials. During this period the judge refuses to put the accused to his election or to set a date. After disclosure is made you elect trial by judge and jury and set a date for a preliminary inquiry. The earliest available date is 15 months away for the four weeks of court time required for this kind of case. The accused is committed for trial after the preliminary inquiry. In the General Division, the earliest available date for a trial of this length is 12 months away. On the trial date the accused discharges his lawyer, due to irreconcilable differences, and retains you. A new date is set for trial that is, once again, 12 months away. The accused has been on bail throughout and has been divorced by his wife due to the stresses of the case. What remedies will you seek at trial?
<p>
36 Minutes <b>Question 3:</b> 20 marks.
<p>
Sgt. Bob of the O.P.P. detachment in Burlington received an anonymous telephone call at the station advising him that there was a brown cube van on the James Bulger farm property, just outside Burlington, and that marijuana was being harvested on the property right now and was being loaded into the brown cube van. Sgt. Bob had no prior knowledge of the telephone caller. He immediately drove out to the James Bulger farm and took up surveillance from an adjacent property. He observed a brown cube van in the yard but there was no indication of marijuana being harvested or being loaded into the van.
<p>
Eventually, James Bulger emerged from the farm house, got into the cube van and drove off. After following the van for a short distance, Sgt. Bob stopped it in order to further his investigation. He asked Bulger if he could &quot;check&quot; the van. Bulger said &quot;sure&quot;. Sgt. Bob then opened the back of the cube van and discovered a quantity of apparently fresh marijuana.
<p>
Sgt. Bob arrested Bulger and then proceeded back to the farm to search Bulger's house. He found nothing in the house and then proceeded to the barn where he located large quantities of marijuana stored in the loft.
<p>
You have been retained to defend Bulger. Explain the issues you will raise at his trial and your prospects of success.
<p>
36 Minutes <b>Question 4:</b> 20 marks
<p>
You are defending Jim Big on a murder charge and, after requesting disclosure prior to election, the Crown provides you with a thick brief. The disclosure materials include witness statements from a number of neutral observers who saw the shooting on a public street and who describe the assailant as a tall, slim blonde man. At the preliminary inquiry you bring out the fact that the accused, Jim Big, is short, dark and stocky and the eye witnesses all concede in cross-examination that he does not resemble the gunman. The judge nevertheless commits Jim for trial on the basis of circumstantial evidence that Jim was seen in the vicinity by the police, prior to the shooting, and had told his friends that he was looking for the deceased to collect a debt. The judge also refuses to allow you to cross-examine the chief investigating officer as to whether the police have interviewed any other eye witnesses not called by the Crown at the preliminary hearing. The judge takes the position that disclosure is the Crown's obligation and is not the function of the preliminary inquiry.
<p>
At trial, you open to the jury and take the position that Mr. Big is not the assailant, relying on the eye witness accounts from the preliminary inquiry. You successfully cross-examine these eye witnesses, in front of the jury, in the same manner as you had at the preliminary inquiry. The Crown then indicates to you, for the first time, that he has been withholding disclosure of one key witness, named Johnny D'Amico, an associate of the deceased, who was in a nearby car waiting for the deceased when the shooting occurred. He knows Jim Big well and can identify him as the assailant. The Crown hands you a statement of Johnny D'Amico's evidence and proposes to call him as the Crown's next witness. The Crown explains that he withheld disclosure because of Jim Big's well known organized crime connections which caused the Crown to fear for Johnny D'Amico's safety if disclosure was made. You seek instructions from your client about D'Amico's statement and your client admits to you for the first time that he did shoot the deceased but that he fired in self-defence.
<p>
What remedies are available to you in the above circumstances both at the stage when the preliminary inquiry concluded and at the stage when the Crown discloses D'Amico's evidence to you in the middle of the trial? What are your prospects of success?

<P>
<B>Part A - EC Legal Order</B>
<P>
Answer <b>one</b> of the following questions:
<ol>
<li>One of the tasks faced by the European Community (&quot;EC&quot;)
has been to manage the tension between integration at the Community level and competing concerns of Member State sovereignty and priorities. Explain how the EC legal order accommodates this tension and evaluate its success in so doing.
<P>
<li>Explain and comment critically upon the effectiveness of the various means by which EC law is &quot;enforced&quot;, i.e. how its implementation is ensured. Refer to the EC Treaty provisions and EC jurisprudence in your answer.
</ol>
<B>Part B - Free Movement of Goods and Persons </B>
<p>Answer <b>one</b> of the following questions:
<ol>
<li>France has established regulations requiring refrigerators produced in France to contain coolants called CFS's, Chilly Frozen Substances, which are considered to be environmentally friendly. In order to ensure that no harmful coolant is used in France, France has banned the import of refrigerators that do not use CFS's as the coolant because of its view that CFS's are the only coolant that is not harmful to the environment. A German company, Frost-Heit, manufactures refrigerators without CFS's, but uses an alternative coolant, &quot;Chillout&quot;, which, it argues, is environmentally safe. Frost-Heit refrigerators are made and marketed legally in Germany. Frost-Heit has complained to the Commission that the French ban on refrigerators that do not use CFS's violates the EC Treaty's provisions on free movement of goods. The Commission agrees and begins proceedings against France under Article 169 for infringement of the EC Treaty.
<blockquote>
 (a) What will the Commission argue?
<P>
 (b) How will France defend its actions?
<P>
 (c) What might the European Court of Justice rule and why?
<P>
(d) If France agrees to implement a procedure whereby coolants
other than CFS's may be licensed for import, what conditions will
such a procedure have to meet according to the <cite>German Beer
Purity</cite> case?
</blockquote>
<li>Ms. Pill, a U.K. citizen, studied to be a pharmacist in Italy
and did the required one-year apprenticeship in Italy. She now wishes to return to
the U.K.to practise her chosen profession. Ms. Pill wrote the U.K. qualifying examination
for pharmacists and has passed with merit. She has been advised by the U.K. Society
of Pharmacists (&quot;U.K.S.P.&quot;), a government-designated body with the
statutory power to license pharmacists, that she does not qualify to be a pharmacist in the
U.K. because she has not completed the U.K.S.P. requirements of four years of education
at a U.K. university faculty of pharmacy and the two year apprenticeship
period. The U.K.S.P. states that her Italian qualifications are not of equivalent value.
<blockquote>
  (a) Assuming the EC has not legislated a directive governing
the licensing l of pharmacists and that no other directive is applicable, what
action do you advise Ms. Pill to take under the EC Treaty and why?
<P>
 (b) Assume the EC has issued a directive to Member States setting
out the equivalence of Member States' university degrees in pharmacy and establishing a minimum training period of one year. The Italian diploma which Ms. Pill has acquired is deemed equivalent to the U.K. degree. The directive was to be implemented by Member States by April 1992. The U.K. has not yet implemented the necessary amendments to the U.K. Society of Pharmacists' Act. Ms. Pill plans to sue the U K S P in the U. K courts to have their refusal to license her overturned. She intends to rely on E.C. law. Explain what Ms. Pill will argue and assess the likelihood of her succeeding.
<P>
 (c) Before her return to the U.K. from Italy, Ms. Pill met and
married a  non-EC citizen who has moved with her to the U.K. Unfortunately, the marriage has not worked out and the couple are separated but not yet divorced. The British government has issued a deportation order against Ms. Pill's spouse. Can he invoke EC law to assist him to remain in the U.K.?
</blockquote></ol>
<B>Part C - EC Competition Law</B>
<P>
Answer <b>one</b> of the following questions:
<ol>
<li>Your client is Decibel, a French manufacturer of high quality
electronic goods such as stereo equipment. Decibel has asked for advice on the legality
of establishing a distribution scheme for electronic goods in the EC. Decibel is
already established on the French market and has several distributors there. Substantial
competition exists within the European Community among different brands of electronic
goods but the Decibel brand has never been aggressively marketed outside of
France.
<blockquote>
 (a) In order to ensure a high level of staff expertise and after-sales
service, Decibel wishes to establish a sole distributor in each Member
State outside of France. Each distributor would be given the exclusive
right to distribute Decibel goods within its Member State and would
agree to market only Decibel products. To discourage parallel imports from
other Member States, each distributor (including the French distributors) will be required to agree not to sell in other Member States. In addition, Decibel wishes to keep the market outside the EC for Decibel itself, by imposing an export ban in all of its contracts
with distributors.
<P>
 (b) Because of the intense competition on the French electronic
goods market, Decibel has been offering special discounts to its French distributors. Decibel does not wish to offer its exclusive distributors in other Member States the same discount because Decibel anticipates that promotional campaigns will be costly for these distributors, and they must be able to recoup their costs. Decibel has decided that to
avoid a situation where the lower-priced French Decibel products are imported into other Member States, French distributors' contracts with Decibel will state that if any Decibel products sold by a French distributor turn up in other Member States, Decibel will sell to such a distributor only at the full price (i.e., no discount).
</blockquote>
Advise Decibel on the legality of the distribution scheme outlined
in (a) and (b) under Article 85 of the EC Treaty. You do <b>not</b>
have to refer to EC <b>secondary</b> legislation in your answer.
<P>
<li>Your client, Wheely, is a bicycle manufacturer in the UK.
Wheely created a special &quot;double-cross&quot; design mountain bike that makes it stronger than other mountain bikes of the same weight. The Wheezy mountain bike is popular both with non-competitive &quot;Sunday&quot; cyclists and with hard-core, competitive mountain bikers. Cyclists wishing to cycle on rough terrain cannot use regular bikes, but must use mountain bikes. The Wheely mountain bike is sold in the UK and on the European continent through distributors. Marketing studies have shown that the Wheely mountain bike is purchased by two-thirds of the mountain bikers in those Member
States where mountain biking is popular (Italy, France, Germany and the U.K.),
but constitutes less than 25 % of all bike sales (mountain or other styles) in
those same Member States.
<P>
Despite its success in the past, Wheely is concerned that it may
lose sales to an &quot;upstart&quot; U.K. manufacturer of mountain
bikes. Wheely has decided to take action to undercut the new competitor.
First, Wheely wants to lower the price of its mountain bikes in
the U.K., while raising its prices substantially on the continent
to make up for the minimal profit it will make in the U.K. High
transport costs for bikes isolate the U.K. market so parallel
imports from the U.K. into the European Continent are not a concern.
Second, Wheely is considering encouraging its distributors to
buy only from Wheely by offering ''fidelity rebates&quot;: if
the distributor buys 90% of its mountain bike requirements each
year from Wheely, then it will receive a 5 % discount off the
gross price. Finally, Wheely is proposing to register design rights
in the U.K. for the &quot;double-cross&quot; design. Wheely intends
to enforce its design rights in the U.K. courts in order to prevent
the import of a German mountain bike that is a copy of the Wheely
design.
<P>
Advise Wheely on the legality of its proposed actions under Article
86 of the Treaty.

<B>QUESTIONS
</B>1. The country of New Brighton has, since independence, used the English common law, but until 1993 it had no environmental legislation. On January 1, 1993, the NB legislature adopted the Act for a Clean Environment (ACE), which incorporated, word for word, the substantive provisions of the Ontario Environmental Protection Act as of 1992, using the same section numbers, where applicable.		
<P>
A lead smelter in New Brighton has operated continuously from
1950 until today, discharging lead and other heavy metals from
its smokestack and depositing the same metals in piles of waste
around the property. The smelter was owned and operated from 1950
to 1980 by Royal Metals, a wholly owned subsidiary of King Steel.
In 1980, Royal sold the land, buildings and business for 1
million [pounds sterling] to Acme Metals. Acme was financed largely by loans from
the Regal Brighton Bank secured by a mortgage on the property.
The air emissions and waste dumping became illegal under ACE on
January 1, 1993. On January 1, 1994, Acme installed controls that
virtually eliminated the air emissions of heavy metals, and began
to deposit the metal-containing waste in an approved landfill
on nearby property. On January 2, the Brighton Ministry of the
Environment ordered Acme to clean up the contaminated soil and
piles of waste citing sections 7, 14, 17, 18 and 97 of the ACE.
This will cost 2 million[pounds sterling], twice the value of the property
prior to the order. Acme refused to clean up and has stopped making
mortgage payments so that Regal Bank could now foreclose on the
mortgage and take possession. a. Advise Acme as to its legal duty
to clean up and to pay for the clean-up under the ACE.
If it has duties and liabilities, what portion of the cost must
it must bear? Has it any rights against Royal Metals? b. Does
Royal Metals have any legal duty to bear any part of the clean-up
cost? If Acme will not clean up, can Royal Metals be ordered to
clean up? c. Advise the Regal Bank as to its best course of action
to minimize its losses on this loan. Explain its risks assuming
that the common law of NB is the same as that of Ontario.<P>
2. The Regional Municipality of Eden, in Southern Ontario, wants
to construct a plastic recycling plant on some agricultural land
in the Region. Eden has purchased an option on the required land,
which is zoned appropriately. Eden expects to hire a private waste
management firm to operate the plant. The Ontario government has
pledged $10 million in grants and loan guarantees and the Federal
government has provided another $2 million, both because of
a firm belief that this will create jobs, or at least votes.
Environmentalists oppose the project because it will be accessible
only by road, it would destroy farm land, and it would discharge
some persistent toxic pollutants into the air and water. a. Is
Environmental Assessment required by Federal or Provincial law?
Why or why not? b. Assume that Provincial EA is required. Discuss
whether: 1. Eden can be required to consider the alternative of
eliminating the use of plastics rather than recycling them. 2.
Eden must present evidence regarding the environmental effects
of its discharge of air and water pollutants that are within regulated
limits. 3. Eden must evaluate the social and economic implications
of the operator hiring unemployed local people at the minimum
wage. 4. Eden must evaluate the occupational health and safety
conditions likely to occur in the proposed plant. c. What environmental
harm may be caught by the EA that would not be prohibited by the
MOE's approval process and emission regulations?<P>
3. Delta operates a meat packing plant that discharges BOD and
six chemicals into the Done River in Ontario. Delta is in compliance
with a C of A issued many years ago. Environmentalists test the
water of the Done and find that it is highly polluted below the
Delta outfall, and that the fish are much less healthy there than
upstream. Scientific experts confirm the poor health of the fish
and conclude that it must be caused by the Delta effluent, but
they cannot identify which chemical in the effluent causes the
harm. Each chemical is known to cause harm at high concentrations,
but none has been shown to be harmful at the concentrations observed
in the river or in the effluent itself. Delta has funded extensive
research on the effects of its effluent on fish and has offered
to install the best available technology to control any pollutant
shown to harm the fish, but has installed only primary treatment
to date because of the lack of scientific evidence. a. What violations
under the EPA or the Fisheries Act? b. What are the chances of
a successful due diligence defense to any prosecution?<P>
4. Epsilon Recycling Products (ERP) owns six incinerators across
Canada, one of which is in Ontario. Each incinerator burns discarded
tires to produce steam and electricity for several plants located
nearby. A baghouse controls particulate emissions, with a sensor
to detect broken bags. The bags are cleaned daily and replaced
monthly, a practice that studies have shown will give rise to
only an average of one broken bag per month, which will cause
emissions exceeding the Schedule I limits for a period of one
hour each. Of course this is an average; some months there are
no breaks and others there may be several.<P>
Careful operation of the incinerator is necessary to ensure temperatures
high enough to avoid the production of dioxin, a potent suspected
mutagen and carcinogen, which is not controlled by the baghouse.
Several sensors report the incinerator temperature continuously
to the operator. Studies predict that substantial dioxin emissions
will occur only in bursts of a few minutes on random occasions
that cannot be predicted or prevented in this type of incinerator.<P>
The above facts were reported to the board of directors and to
the MOE prior to construction of the Ontario incinerator. The
C of A approves the design and does not mention the possible emissions.
The manager of the Ontario incinerator, Mr. Frost, reports to
Mr. Sumner, the Vice-President of operations of ERP. Mr. Frost's
monthly reports indicate the time and date of any bag break and
the duration of high particulate emissions. The reports also
include a complete record of the incinerator temperature sensors.
These monthly reports are also circulated at the meetings of the
Board of Directors. If the bag breaks are high or the temperatures
low, the Board asks Sumner to explain; Sumner asks Frost to explain,
and Frost submits a technical report that only an engineer could
understand, along with a non-technical summary saying that they
are using the best available technology.<P>
The MOE, which regards incineration of tires as undesirable, prosecutes
ERP under Section 14 of the EPA for discharging two contaminants,
particulates and dioxin, likely to cause an adverse effect. It
presents evidence of particulate concentrations greater than 100
[micrograms]/m3 and of low dioxin concentrations at pollution monitors located
in the abandoned mall adjoining the incinerator property. The
only direct human evidence of harm arises from these<P>
substances arises in cases with greater concentrations than occurred
here; there are no epidemiological studies of the lightly populated
area around this incinerator. Scientists are evenly split between
believing in a linear dose-response curve and in a safe threshold
which is above the ambient concentration level caused by ERP.
a. Should the court find that these emissions violate Section 14?
Discuss. b. Should the court find a due diligence defence for
ERP regarding either pollutant? c. Assume that violations are
found. If the MOE names Sumner, Frost and the entire Board as
defendants, can they be convicted under the EPA? Does any of them
have a due diligence defence?<P>

<P>
1.
<p>
The accused, Brian Laforge, is on trial for the murder of Henry
Pinkham, aged 43. One of the issues that arises is the following.
George Lake lives next door to Pinkham in a rather poorly built
town house, the dividing walls of which are thin and far from
sound-proof. He told the police that on the night after the murder
was alleged to have been committed, he heard Laforge talking in
his bedroom to the woman he knows as Mrs. Laforge. Curious, he
placed a drinking glass against the dividing wall (a thing he
had done on numerous other occasions) and was thus able to amplify
the sound so that he heard clearly what was said. He heard Laforge
say, &quot;They'll never be able to pin Pinkham's murder on me.
Don't worry, hon&quot;. He then heard the woman say, &quot;But
what about the knife? Won't it have your fingerprints on it?&quot;
to which Laforge replied, &quot;I wiped it clean&quot;.
<P>
In fact, the woman, Jane, is not actually legally married to Pinkham,
but they have lived together as husband and wife for some twenty
years, have two children whose surname is Laforge, and while Jane
has never legally changed her surname of Pargeter, she is known
throughout the community as Mrs. Laforge. They certainly consider
themselves as a husband and wife.
<P>
2.
<p>
The Crown wishes to call Mrs. Laforge to require her to testify
as to this conversation. They also wish to call George Lake to
testify as to the conversation. If you were the trial judge, would
you allow the Crown to do either? Give reasons.
<P>
The Crown alleges that the accused, Lee Ling, sexually assaulted
the victim, Marianne Cortez, a seventeen year old high school
student by having sexual intercourse with her without her consent
on the night in question. Marianne, after the incident, had laid
a complaint with the police and had been advised to seek therapy
to help her cope with the trauma of the attack. This she did and
attended at Dr. June Boland's clinic set up for this purpose.
Dr. Boland is recognized as an expert in the field and has found
that, after an initial couple of private sessions, group therapy
with three or four victims is of most help. This is what happened
 and one of the other participants was a victim of a different
attack, Mary Gosset.  Mary reported to the police that at one
of the sessions Marianne had said,&quot; I felt a lot of self-doubts
afterwards. I did encourage him and maybe at the time I did consent
and that it was only afterwards that I talked myself into thinking
I'd been raped, but Dr. Boland has helped me see that I really
had not consented&quot;. In fact,  Dr. Boland has a note to this
effect in her records of the session. The police duly reported
this to the Crown Attorney who asked Dr. Boland to hand over her
records to which she replied &quot;Such records are privileged
and I have no intention 4 handing them over. Besides, anything
said in therapy has absolutely no probative value to anything&quot;. 
<P>
The Crown has made disclosure to the accused in accordance with
Stinchcombe, and has stated to him: &quot;There are records
of therapy taken after the attack, but they contain nothing that
is relevant and admissible in evidence&quot;.
<P>
Mary has, however, also reported to Ling's defence counsel, Harvey
Hunt Q.C. her version of what Marianne said and Hunt now wants
to use it somehow -by cross-examining Marianne on it, by calling
Mary and/or by calling Dr. Boland and requiring her to produce
the records. Can he do any of this and how and why (or why not,
as the case may be)?<p>
3.
<P>
Two separate informations were laid charging Gloria Steinbeck
and Martha Salmon with break, enter and theft. Gloria elected
trial by provincial court judge but Martha elected trial by judge
and jury and, as a result, Gloria's trial actually comes on first.
Martha, meanwhile, has been released on bail and the Crown has
subpoenaed her to be a prosecution witness at Gloria's trial.
In fact, without Martha's evidence, the case against Gloria is
pretty weak.
<P>
Both Gloria and Martha (whose counsel appears for the purpose)
object to Martha being required to testify at Gloria's trial.
<P>
Assuming all best arguments for and against are advanced, how
would you rule on this issue?
<P>
4
<P>
<I>It is undoubtedly not competent for the prosecution to adduce
evidence tending to shew that the accused has been guilty of criminal
acts other than those covered in the indictment, for the purpose
of leading to the conclusion that the accused is a person likely
from his criminal conduct or character to have committed the offense
for which he is being tried. On the other hand, the mere fact
that the evidence adduced tends to shew the commission of other
crimes does not render it inadmissible if it be relevant to an
issue before the jury, and it may be so relevant if it bears upon
the question whether the acts alleged to constitute the crime
charged in the indictment were designed or accidental, or to rebut
a defense that would otherwise be open to the accused.</I> Per
Lord Herschell L.C. in Makin v. A.G. for New South Wales [1894]
A.C. 57 at p. 65.
<P>
Critically comment on this dictum in the light of more modern
cases.

<P><center><h3>I</h3></center>
The time is November 1993. As Crown attorney for Metropolitan
Wrightsville, you are handling the prosecution of Ron Abel, charged
with the first degree murder of Pierre Bergson on February l5th,
1993.
<P>
There is no substantial dispute about these facts: Abel and Bergson
had been business partners. When the partnership was formed, they
took out a $200,000 policy of insurance on their joint lives with
Excalibur Insurance Company, each of them named as the beneficiary
upon the prior death of the other during the currency of the partnership.
Shortly before Bergson's death, they quarrelled about Abel's drawing
heavily on the business bank account for private purposes while
profits were dwindling during the economic recession. Bergson's
dead body was found on the track of the Wrightsville Transit Commission
subway at the King station at 10:30 p.m. on February l5th. The
body exhibited multiple wounds and fractures. The skull and chest
were crushed.
<P>
The Crown's position is that Bergson died instantaneously from
injuries sustained upon being hit by an oncoming subway train
after Abel deliberately pushed him off the platform into the path
of the train moments before the body was found. No witness has
been located who saw Bergson going off the platform or being hit
by a train. You know that the position on behalf of Abel is twofold:
First, he was not present at the scene at any relevant time and
otherwise had nothing to do with Bergson's death. Second, Bergson
did not suffer the injuries or die as a result of being hit by
a subway train; death was caused by injuries occurring earlier
at the instance of persons other than Abel who deposited the body
on the track after Bergson's death.
<P>
The trial with a jury in the Flavelle Court of Justice is coming
on next week. As part of your preparation, you review the notes
of your interviews with persons thought to have relevant information.
You propose to write a memorandum resolving any evidence problems
should you call any of the interviewees at the trial to testify
to substantially what they said in the interview.
<P>
Set out immediately below are some of your notes. Write those
portions of the memorandum referable to these, complete with your
analysis and reference to relevant authorities.
<P>
<b>Abin Cherik.</b> Detective Sergeant, Metropolitan Wrightsville
Police. In charge of investigating Bergson's death. Because of
the insurance policy on the lives of the partners, Cherik had
some suspicions about Abel's possible involvement in the death.
Went to Abel's home to interview him on February 20th, 1993. When
he told Abel why he had come, Abel invited him in. Abel
told Cherik that he knew nothing about Bergson's death until the
day after it happened. Abel said that, at the very moment when
Bergson must have been pushed onto the track, he (Abel) was at the Dutchess of York Theatre
in Wrightsville watching a performance of <cite>Swan Lake </cite>by
the Flavelle Ballet Company.
<P>
<b>Francis Danielo.</b> He was descending the stairs to the King
subway station platform at 10:29 p.m. on February 15th, 1993.
He could not yet see the tracks or the edge of the platform. He
could see only part of the platform and three or four people there
running away from the stairs in the direction of the platform
edge. He then realized that he had forgotten some important papers
at home. As he turned to climb the stairs to the subway entrance,
he heard a voice coming from the platform yelling, &quot;Hey look,
some guy is pushing somebody over the edge.&quot;
<P>
<b>William Ellis.</b> Manager, Dutchess of York Theatre, Wrightsville.
A travelling company of <cite>Phantom of the Opera </cite>was performing
at the theatre on February 15th. 1993
<P><hr><p>
<center><h3>II</h3></center>

The time is today. Assume now that you are not a Crown attorney
but rather a lawyer with a general litigation practice in Wrightsville.
You have been retained by Ron Abel who, after trial a year ago,
was convicted of murdering Pierre Bergson. Excalibur Insurance
Company has refused to pay Abel the proceeds under the policy
the business partners had taken out. In defence to Abel's suit
for the proceeds, Excalibur has pleaded that Abel murdered Bergson
on February 15th, 1993 by deliberately pushing him off a subway
platform into the path of a moving train. Excalibur denies any
responsibility in the circumstances to pay the proceeds to Abel
as beneficiary. Excalibur's defence, you know, invokes a
common law rule barring the felonious killer of an insured from
succeeding as beneficiary to the proceeds of an insurance policy
on the deceased's life. In the reply the plaintiff denies all
part in Bergson's death and alleges that Bergson was killed earlier
by third persons who deposited the body on the tracks.
<P>
The non-jury trial of this action is coming on next week. You
review the notes of interviews with persons thought to have relevant
information. You also review other documents in your file. You
write a memorandum to resolve any evidence problems should you
or defendant's counsel use any of the documents at the trial or
offer them in evidence, or call any of the interviewees as trial
witnesses to testify substantially duplicating what they said
in the interviews.
<P>
Set out below are some of your notes. There is also a description
of several of the documents. Write the portions of your memorandum
referable to these, complete with analysis and reference
to relevant authorities.
<P>
<b>Alfred Franz</b>. Doctor of Medicine specializing in pathology.
He has not examined Bergson's body. He has read the portions of
the transcript from Abel's criminal trial about the condition
of the body when found and when later examined at the morgue.
He has also examined the colour photographs taken by the police
after the autopsy. Based on this information, he believes that
Bergson died no later than 9:00 p.m. on February 15th, 1993.
<P>
You have in your file a copy under the court's seal of the formal
judgment of Abel's conviction on the charge of murdering Bergson
on February 15th, 1993. You also have copies of the photographs
Dr. Franz examined.

1. Through a mutual friend, Roseanne and Tom met in 1973. Roseanne was an 18 year old high school student; Tom was 22 and worked in a variety store. After dating for some time, the two decided to marry. They announced their engagement when Roseanne was 19 and Tom was 23.
<p>
Roseanne's parents were very pleased with the engagement. Even though Tom's family was not well off, Tom seemed to be hard working and had all sorts of ambitious plans to start his own business one day. He seemed as though he would be able to provide a secure living for their daughter. For their part, Tom's parents were also delighted with their son's news. Not only did they love Roseanne, they had always hoped to see their son set up in business, and marriage to Roseanne seemed to make this possible. Roseanne's father was a well-to-do businessman who had important connections. He could give Tom sound business advice and - of course - he could lend Tom the capital he would need to set himself started.
<p>
At about the same time as Roseanne announced her engagement, Roseanne's parents decided to buy a larger house in a fancier neighbourhood. Instead of selling their first house, they decided to give it to Roseanne as an engagement present. Roseanne was absolutely thrilled. She had grown up in that house and had become very attached to it. She had always hoped to be able to raise her children in the neighbourhood in which she had been raised.
<p>
Roseanne's parents also threw a lavish engagement party for the young couple. Having learned of the gift Roseanne had received from her parents, Roseanne's friends decided to pool their resources and buy furniture for Roseanne's house. Since almost all of her many friends contributed something to the endeavour, Roseanne came away with a bedroom set and living room furniture. Tom's friends also gave Tom a shared gift: a 14 inch colour T.V.
<p>
Finally, two years after Tom and Roseanne first met, the big day arrived. Tom and Roseanne were wed in a lovely ceremony at Trinity College Chapel, and, like so many other couples, had their wedding photographs taken in front of a very picturesque law school.
<p>
After the wedding, life was blissful for a time. With Roseanne's father's help, Tom opened a restaurant. Roseanne worked briefly in the restaurant, but quit when discovered she was pregnant. Two days before Tom and Roseanne's first anniversary, their son, Michael, was born. Two and a half years later, Roseanne gave birth to another son, George. Roseanne stayed home to look after the kids while Tom worked long hours in his restaurant.
<p>
A few years after George's birth, Tom's restaurant began having financial difficulties. Having learned of the trouble, Roseanne's father decided to help out by giving Roseanne $25,000. Roseanne took $5,000 for herself, and gave the remaining $20,000 to Tom to use in his business. She deposited $1,000 in her bank account, and invested $4,000 in shares in one of her father's companies. 
<p>
Unfortunately, even with the assistance from Roseanne's father, Tom was unable to hold on to his business. By the time he decided to sell the restaurant, he had accumulated nearly $100,000 in debt. Shell-shocked, Tom took a job working for Roseanne's father. He also began to drink.
<p>
Once again, Roseanne's father decided to give her a gift. This time, he gave her $50,000. Roseanne turned the entire amount over to Tom to help pay back his debts. She hoped that reducing the debt quickly would help Tom get back on his feet.
<p>
Tom started businesses on two subsequent occasions. The first of these, a clothing store, lasted seven years. The second, a fish market, lasted 3 months. Each time, Roseanne's father gave her money. The first time, he gave her $20,000; the second, $30,000. Each time, Roseanne kept a little ($2,000) for herself and turned the rest over to Tom to invest in his business. On each occasion, Roseanne deposited $1,000 in her bank account to use on every day expenses, and invested the other $1000 in shares.
<p>
When his last business failed, Tom's drinking, which was already heavy, became worse. Tom also began to have affairs with other women. For a time, Roseanne ignored the affairs, hoping they would stop when Tom recovered from his latest failure. Finally, she could take it no longer and asked Tom to stop. When he did not, Roseanne gave him an ultimatum: stop seeing other women or leave. Tom left. Roseanne and Tom had been married for 18 years.
<p>
Shortly after Tom left, in December 1993, Roseanne discovered she was pregnant. She told Tom, and they agreed to resume cohabitation and to try to work things out. However, before she allowed Tom to move back in, Roseanne asked him to sign an agreement that in the event their marriage ended, he would not claim any share of her house. Tom consented, albeit reluctantly, and both he and Roseanne signed the agreement. Neither sought legal advice. 
<p>
A month and a half later, Roseanne discovered that Tom was continuing to have affairs. She asked him to leave. She did not, however, begin divorce proceedings right away because she hoped that Tom might change his ways once the baby was born. Unfortunately, the birth of a daughter in August, 1994 did not impel Tom to change his behaviour. What did change was that Roseanne's house, worth $350,000 at the time of the initial separation in November, 1993, had decreased in value to $330,000.
<p>
Roseanne has now come to you for legal advice. She has heard that in Ontario, married people must share all property upon divorce <b>no matter how that property was acquired</b>. She has also heard that each spouse is <b>always</b> entitled to half of the family home. She wants you to tell her if these statements are true. She also wants you to tell her how the law on family property applies to her case. In particular, Roseanne wishes to know: 1) whether the contract she and Tom signed would hold up in court; 2) if the contract is <b>not </b>enforceable - whether she has to give Tom half of the matrimonial home; 3) if she does have to share the home, whether the fact that it was Tom's behaviour that broke up the marriage and the fact that she now has a baby to raise on her own are relevant; and 4) if these factors are not relevant, whether Roseanne can make Tom share in the house's decrease in value.
<p>
To assist you in preparing your opinion, Roseanne has compiled the following information. She is not sure whether all of it is relevant, nor whether she has given you all the necessary facts you will need to come to your conclusion.
<p>
- During the marriage, Roseanne did not work outside the home. She did, however, take care of all the household tasks, and raise the two boys. Tom was the financial provider, and because he often worked long hours, he did almost nothing around the house.
<p>
<b>Roseanne's Financial Information</b>
<p>
1. At the point of marriage breakdown, Roseanne owned the house, and its furniture. She also had a bank account and some shares.
<p>
2. When she married, Roseanne owned the house and the furniture given to her at her engagement party. She also had a bank account. At the date of marriage, the house was worth $25,000. The furniture was worth $5,000, $3,000 for the living room furniture and $2,000 for the bedroom set. The bank account contained $500.
<p>
3. At the point of marriage breakdown, the house was worth $350,000. It is worth $315,000 now.
<p>
4. At the point of marriage breakdown, Roseanne's furniture was valued at $40,000. The bedroom set (the engagement gift) was worth $8,000. During the marriage, Roseanne had sold the living room furniture received at her engagement party for $6,000. She used the money to buy new living room furniture more to her taste. Upon separation, that furniture was worth $10,000. It has not changed in value since separation.
<p>
5. The shares, bought for $4,000, $1,000 and $1,000 respectively have appreciated in value. They were worth $15,000, $3,000, and $2,000, respectively at separation. They have however, decreased slightly in value since separation so they are now worth $13,000, $2,500, and $1,500 respectively.
<p>
6. The bank account contained $500 at separation. It now contains $300.
<p>
<b>Tom's Financial Information</b>
<p>
1. At the point of marriage breakdown, Tom owned a 20 inch colour T.V. (the one he received as his engagement gift having broken), a V.C.R., a stereo system, and a 1983 Volvo sedan. He also had a bank account.
<p>
2. When he married, Tom had the T.V. he'd received at the engagement party, a bank account, and a 1971 corvette. The T.V. was worth $500. The bank account contained $200. Tom, was, however, heavily in debt for the car. He'd bought the car because it was &quot;cool&quot; even though it was well beyond his means. Tom <I>owed </I>$2,700 on the car when he married.
<p>
3. At the point of marriage breakdown, the 20 inch T.V. was worth $400, the V.C.R. was worth $150, the stereo was worth $1000, the Volvo was worth $2,100 and Tom had $350 in his savings account. Since separation, Tom has depleted his savings.
<p>
Draft an opinion for Roseanne answering her questions and explaining how the NFP calculation on these facts would be done. If you feel that Roseanne has failed to provide you with sufficient information, you are free to make assumptions as long as you indicate where you are doing so. Do NOT discuss spousal support in answering this question.
<p>
2. Choose <b>ONE</b> of the following questions:
<p>
a) Using your knowledge of spousal support, comment on the cases of <cite>Moge</cite> and <cite>Elliot</cite>. To what extent do they embody principles that are helpful in conceptualizing a modern obligation of spousal support? Even though they may be said to endorse a compensatory model of spousal support, by signalling that support should often be awarded on a long term basis, is effect of these decisions to take us back to a more traditional understanding of spousal support? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the decisions? To answer this question, you will want to consider the three models of spousal support Professor Rogerson discusses, and comment on which of the three offers the best way of thinking about the modern obligation of spousal support. You may also wish to consider whether there are other approaches to spousal support, or whether the approach adopted in <cite>Moge</cite> is the best we can do.
<p>
<center><h3>OR</h3></center>
b) In <cite>Moge</cite>, L' Heureux-Dube J. criticizes the decision in <cite>Heineman v. Heineman</cite>, in which the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal endorsed the application of different principles of spousal support for &quot;traditional&quot; as opposed to &quot;modern&quot; marriages. L'Heureux-Dube J. stated (Casebook, pp. 919-20):
<blockquote>
There are, however, many cases which do not fall easily into either category. These cases pose difficulties for courts which attempt to make assessments based on two clear stereotypes, especially when determining the question of self-sufficiency... Given the concerns I harbour about making a spouse's entitlement to support contingent upon the degree to which he or she is able to fit within a mythological stereotype...the distinction between &quot;traditional&quot; and &quot;modern&quot; marriages does not seem to be to be as useful as the courts have indicated so far. While it may reflect flexibility on the part of courts and constitute an attempt to achieve fairness, I am of the view that there are much more sophisticated means which may be resorted to in order to achieve the objectives set out in the [<i>Divorce</i>] Act, a matter which I will deal with later in these reasons.
</blockquote>
To what extent does L'Heureux-Dube succeed in setting out &quot;more sophisticated means&quot; of how spousal support should be determined in particular cases? How different is the judgment in <cite>Moge</cite> differ from the judgment in <cite>Heineman</cite>?
<p>
3. Choose <b>ONE</b> of the following questions:
<p>
a) Should marriage continue to exist as a distinct legal institution, giving rise to a set of rights and obligations that differs from those arising from other intimate relationships? If your answer to this question is yes, on what basis can this special status for marriage be justified? If your answer to this question is no, how should the law be altered to remove the institutions privileged status? Should the legal rights and obligations that arise from marriage be extended to other adult relationships? If so, to which relationships? Or, should the law do away with the rights and obligations associated with marriage all together and require adults to regulate their own relationships through domestic contract? Your analysis of these questions should be informed by your course materials and classroom discussions.
<p>
<center><h3>OR</h3></center>

b) By determining who can and cannot enter into the institution of marriage, the law on validity and nullity of marriage allows the state to impose on people a notion of marriage. Discuss the existing criteria of essential validity of marriage with a view to considering to what extent this notion of marriage conflicts with, or is consistent with, our commitments to pluralism and gender equality. In answering this question, you should address to what extent it is permissible for the state to dictate who can and cannot enter into the institution of marriage and whether, in light of the liberalization of divorce, there is any reason for retaining the law of nullity.

<h2>ANNUAL EXAMINATIONS, DECEMBER 1994<br>
FIRST NATIONS AND THE LAW<br>
Examiner: Professor Macklem</h2></center>
There are two Parts to this Examination.
<p>
Those who have opted to hand in an Essay in accordance with the Essay option are to Answer only Part I. Part I is worth 50% of your final grade. Your Essay is worth the other 50% of your grade. Please include your Essay in your Examination booklet. You must stop writing at 11:00 a.m. Do not continue to write after this time. When you leave the room, please be considerate to those who are writing the complete Examination.
<p>
Those students who have opted not to hand in an Essay must answer Part I and Part II. Each Part is worth 50% of your final grade. You must stop writing at 12:30 p.m.
<p>
Because this examination contains relatively open-ended questions, you have some latitude in deciding what to discuss. You must make good faith efforts not to duplicate your responses in each Part. similarly, those of you who opted to hand in an Essay must make good faith efforts to craft an answer to Part I which is distinct from your Essay.
<p>
At the conclusion of the Examination, you will be asked to stop writing, gather your books and coats, and leave the Examination room. <b>YOUR EXAMINATION ANSWER BOOKLETS SHOULD BE LEFT ON THE WRITING TABLE.</b>
<p>
Time limits will be enforced. students who continue to write after the examination has ended may be subject to a penalty.
<p>
You may use any kind of material you wish during the examination, for example, notes, the casebook, and texts,
except books owned by the library.
<p>
<center><h3>PART I</h3></center>
All students are required to answer Part I.
<p>
Answer only <b>one</b> of the following two questions:
<p>
1. You have been retained by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to advise the federal government on whether it ought to revise aspects of its comprehensive claims policy. Specifically, the Minister seeks your opinion on whether, and, if so, how, the federal government ought to revise:
<blockquote>
(a) its requirements concerning the &quot;cession and surrender&quot; of aboriginal title in exchange for treaty-based rights (20 points);
<p>
(b) its requirement that self-government agreements provide that any rights of self-government contained therein are not &quot;treaty rights&quot; within the meaning of section 35 of the <cite>Constitution Act, 1982 </cite>(10 points); and
<p>
(c) its policy that the <cite>Charter of Rights and Freedoms </cite>ought to apply to the exercise of Aboriginal governmental power authorized by a self-government agreement (20 points).
</blockquote>
Please advise.
<p>
2. You are a law clerk to the Chief Justice of Canada. After hearing oral argument in a case involving Aboriginal rights, the Chief Justice informs you that she is worried that case law on the distribution of legislative authority, and, in particular, on section 91(24) of the <cite>Constitution Act, 1867</cite>, does not adequately address the presence of, and case law on, section 35 of the <cite>Constitution Act, 1982</cite>.  She asks you to prepare a memorandum that critically assesses the law governing the distribution of legislative authority in light of section 35. In so doing, she wants you to propose and defend an alternative approach regarding the distribution of legislative authority between Parliament and provincial legislatures in light of section 35.
<p>
<center><h3>PART II</h3></center>
Note: Only those students who have opted not to write an Essay are to answer Part II.
<p>
Answer only <b>one</b> of the following two questions.
<p>
1. In <cite>Eastmain Band v. JBNQA (Administrator)</cite> (1992), 99 D.L.R. (4th) 16 (at p. 365 of the casebook), the Federal Court of Appeal (at p. 367) stated:
<blockquote>
We must be careful, in construing a document as modern as the 1975 Agreement, that we do not blindly follow the principles laid down by the Supreme Court of Canada in analyzing treaties entered into in an earlier era. The principle that ambiguities must be construed in favour of the aboriginals rests, in the case of historic treaties, on the unique vulnerability of the aboriginal parties, who were not educated and were compelled to negotiate with parties who had a superior bargaining position, in languages and with legal concepts which were foreign to them and without adequate representation. ...
<p>
In this case, there was simply no vulnerability. The Agreement is the product of a long and difficult process of negotiation. The benefits received and concessions made by the aboriginal parties were received and given freely, after serious thought, in a situation which was, to use their counsel's expression, one of &quot;give and take&quot;. ... We have come a long way indeed from the &quot;uneducated savages&quot; referred to by Norris J.A. in White, supra.
</blockquote>
Please comment.
<p>
2. Thomas Berger recently wrote the following:
<blockquote>
How can a liberal democracy tolerate political institutions limited to persons of one race? To Native people, this objection seems mindless. They were here first. This is not just a trite saying; it is the basis of their case.

<P>
 1. Canadian Transport Company Limited (&quot;CT&quot;) is a subsidiary
of MacMillan Bloedel Limited (&quot;MB&quot;). CT carries on business as a transporter
of a variety of materials and equipment used in a variety of industrial contexts.
<P>
MB is a Canadian company and carries on business across North America.
<P>
In 1986, MB determined that it wished to consolidate its various
insurance coverages. To that time, MB had maintained different
insurance coverages with different insurers for various aspects
of its business, including its transportation business which it
carried on directly and through CT. As a result, MB invited five
insurance brokers to meet with it, review its insurance portfolio
and make a proposal for consolidation of its insurance portfolio
with a single insurer or group of insurers in a single consolidated
policy form.
<P>
MB met with each of the brokers. In each case, MB provided the
brokers with a copy of its latest consolidated financial statements
and shareholders' report. The financial statements and shareholders'
report reviewed MB's business, including the business of each
of its subsidiaries. The report did not disclose that MB and its
subsidiary, Alaskan Coast Ship Lines Ltd., had been found liable
in a highly publicized case for environmental damages to the State
of Alaska and the Province of British Columbia as a result of
an oil spill which occurred in 1981 and which was subject of a
Judgment in the Alaskan Federal Court of $1.6 billion. The Judgment
was actually rendered shortly after the consolidated financial
statements and shareholders' report had been prepared and distributed.
No mention was made of the Judgment, which was under appeal, in
any of the meetings with the brokers.
<P>
As a result of the foregoing, MB ultimately pursued a proposal
put forward by The Canadian Insurance Brokerage Corporation (&quot;CIBC&quot;)
on behalf of a consortium of eight insurers. A consolidated policy
of insurance was issued containing twelve independent components,
including a marine insurance component pertaining to MB's marine
operations.
<P>
The marine insurance component contained, <I>inter aria, </I>the
following provisions:
<blockquote><ol>
<li>The Insured was named as MB and its subsidiary companies.
<P>
<li>The Insured was covered for legal liability as Time or Voyage charterers or as owner in respect of its North American operations in accordance with the following provisions:
<p>
 (a) For loss of or damage to the chartered vessel.
<P>
 (b) For loss of hire money due to the chartered vessel being idle by reason of any accident for which the Insured may be responsible.
<P>
 (c) To the owner or others interested in the cargo to the extent that the Insured is liable as carrier either as damages or for loss of or damage to the cargo.
<P>
<li>The following &quot;sue and labour&quot; clause:
<P>
&quot;and in case of any loss or misfortune it shall be lawful
for the Insured, its factors, servants and assigns, to sue, labour
and travel for, in and about the defence, safeguard and recovery
of the said goods and merchandise and ship or any part thereof,
without prejudice to this insurance.&quot;
</ol></blockquote>
In 1992, CT held a time charter on two vessels, the Warschau and
the Dresden. Each vessel was owned by German ship owners. CT contracted
to carry coal on the Dresden for a Taiwanese company from New
Orleans to Taiwan. The coal was to be delivered by October 1,
1992.
<P>
For reasons which are not clear, the Dresden arrived in New Orleans
sixteen days late. The coal was immediately loaded upon the Dresden
and it set off for Taiwan. Once off the coast of California, the
coal was found to be heating to a point that there was a danger
of spontaneous combustion. The Dresden put in at Long Beach and
the coal was off loaded. Testing produced the expert opinion that
failure to take such steps would have resulted in a fire on board
the ship. The Dresden was idle for 26 days and was then directed
by CT to another port. The coal was later loaded on the Warschau,
which completed the voyage to Taiwan, arriving on October 31,
1992.
<P>
The Dresden required substantial repairs for damage caused by
the overheated coal. The contractual arrangements with the crew
aboard the Dresden were such that it would be paid a fixed fee
until October 15, 1992, following which a surcharge of $250,000
per week would be paid for each week beyond October 15, 1992.
In addition, late delivery of the coal carried a penalty payable
to the Taiwanese company in an amount to be determined based on
a complicated contractual formula.
<P>
As a result of the foregoing, CT was sued in London, England on
March 20, 1993 by the owners of the Dresden for damages in the
amount of $4 million U.S. arising out of the repairs necessitated
by the overheated coal. At about the same time, CT was sued by
the Taiwanese company for late delivery of the coal. This lawsuit
was launched in California and sought $4.2 million U.S.
<P>
MB gave notice to CIBC of the claims that had been made against
CT. As well, MB claimed for the cost of all of the steps taken
at Long Beach in protecting the Dresden, including off loading
and reloading the coal on the Warschau, and for the cost of the
surcharge for the crew. MB also put in claims on behalf of a number
of crew members for damages suffered by them at Long Beach, both
as to property and as to personal injury. Finally, MB claimed
for lost revenue due to the incapacity of the Dresden as a result
of the damage suffered due to the overheated coal.
<P>
The insurers were asked to defend each of the proceedings that
had been commenced, but refused to do so on the ground that the
claims were not covered claims under the marine portion of the
policy. In addition, the insurers declined all of the other claims
made.
<P>
As a result, MB and CT retained their own counsel, defended each
of the proceedings and ultimately settled each of them for part
payment. MB and CT then sought indemnity from its insurers for
the amounts settled as well as the other claims described above.
At this point, the insurers persisted in their position that none
of the losses were covered.
<P>
MB and CT commenced an action in Toronto on December 1, 1994.
MB and CT had not filed any formal proof of loss with CIBC or
with the insurers. A provision in the marine portion of the insurance
policy provided that all actions under the policy would have to
be brought within eighteen months of the occurrence of the events
giving rise to the action. This provision had never been pointed
out to MB by CIBC.
<P>
You have been consulted by MB and CT and have been asked to provide
a legal opinion as to their chances of success for all claims
against the insurers. Write the opinion which you would render
to MB and CT exploring all defenses which might be raised by the
insurers and responses to those defences that might be made on
behalf of MB and CT. You must explore each of the claims for recovery
which MB and CT are putting forward. You must also explore whether
there are any other persons that MB and CT might look to for recovery
of their losses and whether these persons have any defences to
a claim by MB and CT against them.

<h2>TAKE-HOME EXAMINATION, DECEMBER 1994<br>
INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW<br>
Examiner: Professor R.J. Cook</h2></center>
<blockquote>
<b>You have 48 hours (including Friday 4:30 p.m. to Monday 9:00 a.m.) to present a response to the following question.</b>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
<b>QUESTION</b>
<p>
The complainant, Mr. A. M., is a journalist, writer and longtime opponent of the one-party system in C-land. C-land ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its Optional Protocol in 1980. Upon ratification, C-land reserved its obligations to implement the Covenant when those obligations were contrary to the public order. The government of C-land explained that such a reservation was necessary given the historical problems of civil strife in the country.
<p>
Mr. A. M. has frequently and publicly advocated the introduction of multi-party democracy and has worked toward the establishment of a new political party in his country. He contends that some of the books that he has written were either banned or prohibited from circulation in C-land by the C-land government.
<p>
On 16 June 1988 the complainant was arrested, after an interview given to a correspondent of the international press corps in which he had criticized both the President of C-land and the government. He claims that in detention, he was not only interrogated about this interview but also subjected to cruel and inhuman treatment. He indicates that from 18 June to 12 July 1988 he was continuously held in a cell at the First Police District of C-ville, the capital of C-Land. This cell measured approximately 25 square metres and contained 25 to 30 other detainees. The cell did not have sanitary facilities. As the authorities refused to feed him initially, the complainant was without food for several days, until his friends and family managed to locate him.
<p>
From 13 July to 10 August 1988, Mr. A. M. was detained in a cell at the Headquarters of the Second Police District in C-ville, together with common criminals. He claims that he was not allowed to wear any clothes, and that he was forced to sleep on a concrete floor. Within two weeks of detention under these conditions, he fell ill with a chest infection (bronchitis). Thereafter, he was allowed to wear his clothes and to use old cartons as a sleeping mat.
<p>
On 10 August 1988, the complainant was released. However on 26 February 1990, he was rearrested, following a public meeting on 23 January 1990 in C-ville during which several people, including Mr. A. M., had discussed ways and means of introducing multi-party democracy in C-land. He was charged with an offence under Ordinance 18 of 1962, which makes it an offense to make public statements that may cause political confusion.
<p>
Between 26 February and 23 March 1C90, Mr. A. M. was detained without being charged with any offence in a cell at the First Police District of C-ville. He allegedly was not allowed to see either his lawyer, his wife or his friends. He was subjected to intimidation and mental torture, in that he was threatened that he would be taken to the torture chamber and shot, should any unrest develop in the population. He took these threats seriously, as two of his opposition colleagues, who were detained with him, had in fact been tortured. On one day, he allegedly was locked in his cell for twenty-four hours, suffering from the heat (temperatures above 40 C). On another day, he was beaten by a prison warden when he refused to eat.
<p>
In July 1990, Mr. A. M. was ordered to appear before a judge of the High Court of C-land on a charge of provoking civil unrest and was placed under military jurisdiction. Mr. A. M.'s lawyer twice applied to the High Court for writs of <cite>habeas corpus</cite>. Both were rejected on the ground that the case was now before a military tribunal and no writ of <cite>habeas corpus</cite> lies against a military tribunal.
<p>
Mr. A. M. contends that there is no effective remedy for him to pursue in the C-land courts for any of the denials of rights he has suffered, and that he should be deemed to have complied with the requirements of Article 5, paragraph 2 (b) of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In respect of his arrests in 1988 and 1990, Mr. A. M. claims that under Ordinance 18 of 1962 the peaceful public expression of opinions is considered a crime. The complainant adds that there is no procedure under domestic law by which one could challenge a law as being incompatible with international human rights standards. Fundamental human rights are only guaranteed in the preamble to the country's Constitution, and the preambular paragraphs are not enforceable.
<p>
In 1990 the government of C-land filed a derogation notice with the Secretary General of the United Nations. In the notice the C-land government explained that given the difficulties of maintaining law and order in C-land, it was derogating from its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
<p>
Please draft a decision with respect to the above complaint for consideration for adoption by lie Human Rights Committee.

Life in the taxi industry in Metro Toronto has seen better days.
1994 was the year ethnic tensions and multicultural issues burst
onto the scene and of course there was the two month strike at
Diamond and Metro cabs. For parts of the industry, times remained
turbulent even after the settlement of the strike. This was especially
true for a number of smaller companies who were the targets of
an organizing drive launched by the Amalgamated Transit Union
(ATU) after the dust settled at Diamond and Metro. Spurred by
the success of their negotiations with Diamond and Metro, the
ATU set out to organize other companies in the industry.
<P>
One of those targeted by the ATU was AB Cabs (ABC) a company with
a fleet of twenty cabs which was owned by Dick Edsel (DE). ABC
regularly employed 34 employees for varying periods of time each
week. Of these two were dispatchers, one was a clerk-accountant,
another was a tradesperson-mechanic, ten were long service drivers
who had leased one of the company's cabs on an annual basis for
several years, and the other twenty were drivers who formed a
pool from which Edsel &quot;staffed&quot; his other ten cars.
Each driver in this latter group usually worked between 15-20
hours per week depending on their seniority and how Edsel felt
about them. [There was another group of 10 people who drove the
cars that were leased annually, on evenings and weekends, and
who were paid directly by the drivers who leased the cabs. These
individuals were not considered employees by the company and were
not solicited by the ATU.]
<P>
At first the union's organizing drive went quietly and quickly.
It started in mid-September and by mid-October it had signed up
just over half of ABC's employees. Things became more tense during
the last week of October when Edsel felt obliged to fire four
of his longest serving drivers, F.Gass (FG), H. Ideler (HI), J.Knob
(JK) L. Motasingh (LM). Gass was fired for refusing to participate
in a drug testing program Edsel introduced unilaterally in late
October. Ideler and Knob were let go when they jointly refused,
on two occasions, to drive through legal picket lines to deliver
packages to companies whose workers were on strike. Motasingh
was terminated because Dick discovered that as an adherent of
the Sikh faith he insisted on keeping a kirpan (religious knife)
on his person in violation of company rules.
<P>
When Gass, Ideler, Knob and Motasingh were fired, all within a
week, the situation went from bad to worse. Many of the employees
were outraged by what they regarded as very heavy handed and arbitrary
behaviour by Edsel and by the end of the first week of November
the union had signed cards from 28 of ABC's 34 employees. On November
7 the ATU applied for certification.
<P>
When Edsel learned of the union's application he decided to throw
in the towel. Since early spring he had actually been discussing
the idea of selling off his &quot;plates&quot; (taxi licenses)
to any of his employees who wanted to buy one and turning his
company into a co-operative of independent operators. When he
realized that the union's application for certification was a
&quot;fait accompli&quot; he instructed his lawyer to begin drafting
up documents with a view of trying to form a new taxi co-op early
in the new year.
<P>
With all of the confusion and uncertainty surrounding the union's
application, the terminations of Gass, Ideler, Knob and Motasingh
and Edsel's announcement of the formation of a new co-operative
association, the employees of ABC have pooled their resources
and come to you, as a group, to secure independent legal advice.
Specifically they want to know what the outcome of the union's
application for certification (which is scheduled for Monday,
December 12) will be, whether Edsel can turn his company into
a co-op, and what legal rights (both statutory and at common law),
Gass, Ideler, Knob and Motasingh have against Edsel. They also
want to know how, if at all, Edsel's rights to terminate Gass,
Ideler, Knob and Motasingh would have been affected if the union
had applied for and been certified by the middle of October when
it had a majority of the employees signed up.

1. &quot;The liberal claim of the equal moral worth of all individuals
has been the foundation of the demands for equality of all oppressed
groups, including women. When feminists (and other critics) challenge
the universality and objectivity of basic liberal rights, they
undermine their own position and threaten the ability of future
people to use the law and its underlying conceptions of rights
and justice as an effective tool against discrimination and oppression.
<P>
The shared values of today, may be recognized as prejudice tomorrow.
Today's relationships may come to be seen as the sources of oppression.
Only a conception of rights that is universal (and thus necessarily
abstract and general) can be the foundation of a just and enduring
legal system.&quot;
<P>
Evaluate this claim on the basis of the readings and discussion
in this course. You should focus on two or three authors referring
to one or two others by way of support, contrast or example.
<P>
2. In different ways, Peller, MacKinnon, Finley and Williams all
focus on law and language as contingent social creations. Explain
how we can understand the nature of law and its potential and
limitations as an agent of change (or of security or liberty)
better by using their perspectives. What problems arise from adopting
these perspectives and what are the potential solutions to them?
(If you think the problems cannot be overcome, you may use this
question to focus on the problems and use a contrasting author,
such as Dworkin, to defend an alternative.) If you wish, you may
use Taylor and/or Williams to focus on the importance of narrative
or storytelling in the understanding and practice of law.
<P>
3. Discuss Dworkin's distinction between principle and policy
and the role they play in his understanding of what a judge should
do. Use two or three of the authors listed at the end of this
question to critically engage with Dworkin's argument, and to
reflect on what, if any, ways we should distinguish &quot;law&quot;
from &quot;politics.&quot; Is there anything that should distinctively
characterize &quot;law&quot;? Peller, MacKinnon, Scales, Crenshaw
and Williams.
<P>
4. What is Crenshaw's defence of the usefulness of rights? Does
she tacitly accept a Dworkinian understanding of rights? What
are the similarities and differences between their understandings
(recognizing that Crenshaw is not spelling out a full theory of
rights)? Use 2 of the following to further explore the strengths
and weaknesses of invoking legal rights to achieve equality: MacKinnon,
Peller, Taylor, Scales.
<P>
5. A great deal of feminist theory urges us to make &quot;difference&quot;
central. Scales tells us to seek a legal system that &quot;works
and at the same time makes differences a cause for celebration,
not classification&quot; (p. 1376, 141 of casebook). How should
we approach this issue? What would it mean to make difference
central to law? What are the problems, what are the advantages?
use three of the following: Benhabib, Spellman, Crenshaw, Gilligan,
MacKinnon, Scales, Hoagland, Nedelsky.
<P>
6. There are many variants of the critique of universalistic conceptions
of rights and of the replies that, however, useful the particularistic,
context focused alternatives, we cannot do without some universal
claims. Discuss three of the following: Scales, Benhabib, Tronto
and Taylor, or focus on two of them and contrast with Rawls.
<P>
7. Use Taylor, Galston, and Sandel (you may focus primarily on
two of them) and Rawls and/or Kant to discuss the question of
whether all theories of rights have a conception of the good underlying
them. What difference does this issue make for our understanding
of the nature of the law and its neutrality? Your essay may focus
primarily on Taylor, Galston, Sandel and bring in Rawls and/or
Kant only by way of counterpoint, or you may reverse the emphasis
and focus on the defence of the priority of right. If you reverse
the emphasis, you may also want to consider Dworkin.

<h3>QUESTION</h3>
AB is a healthy woman aged 26 whose sister CB, aged 22, suffers from kidney failure. In July of this year, AB decided to donate a kidney to her sister, and in September both women entered Tronville General Hospital for transplantation surgery. AB had a kidney removed in one operating theatre in the hospital while her sister was prepared for surgery to receive the implant in another operating room in a different wing of the hospital.
<p>
A kidney was successfully removed from AB, and she was taken to the recovery room where she made routine responses towards recuperation. The kidney was prepared for transmission to CB and placed in a container to be delivered to the operating theatre where CB was waiting. Due to confusion, however, the staff member due to collect the container holding the kidney, a salaried medical technician, picked up the wrong container. By the time the mistake was discovered at CB's operating theatre, the container holding the kidney had been emptied into a depository containing pathological waste awaiting incineration, and had become contaminated and unfit for transplantation.
<p>
Advise AB and CB of their remedies against the hospital.

This exam is a 48 hour take home exam which may be written during any 48 hour period of the exam session. Students should note on their exam that they spent only 48 hours. Students are to do their own work although they may discuss answers prior to writing them individually. All questions are to be answered. Questions 1 and 2 are each worth 40 marks, Question 3 is worth 20 marks.
</blockquote>
1.	Suggest important provisions for a new Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act, with reasons.
<p>
2.	K owns a large tract of land on a beautiful but polluted lake, which it also owns, in an Ontario city. The land is zoned Cottage parks which permits seasonal residential 	buildings and recreational uses such as club house, golf course and restaurants&quot;. It has on it 20 old cottages which have not been occupied for two years and a golf course and a club house which are still being used. When the cottages were occupied they were rented on a daily and weekly basis over the summer months.
<p>
The City, on November 30, 1994, approved an official plan amendment for the area in which the lands are located. That official plan amendment redesignated the lands to &quot;open space&quot;. That designation permits no development of the lands and was approved because the lands are beyond the edge of residential development in the City and the City wishes to prevent residential development from spreading into this area at this time because of a lack of schools, parks, and water and sewage services. K wishes to develop a theme park on the lands which would operate year round but which would include a large tent over a concrete platform for which a building permit under the Building Code Act would be required. K proposes to bring circus acts from around the world to perform in the tent. She further proposes to have this use for a number of years until the market changes, at which time she wishes to have a residential development. There is no need for additional services for the theme park.
<P>
The residents on the other side of the lake are concerned about
the development of the theme park. Although they will not be affected
by traffic or noise, they believe that circuses are &quot;tacky&quot;,
do not provide high quality entertainment, particularly since
they may include live animal acts, and employ undesireables. They
also are concerned about the floodlighting of the theme park bung
directed across the lake at their homes and the need for proper
landscaping to buffer the theme park from their view. In addition
they believe that if K is allowed to develop her theme park, which
they strongly oppose, she should be required to remediate the
polluted lake.
<P>
K is prepared to apply for a building permit to construct the
platform and the residents have gone to their local councillor
so that the City will prevent the theme park from opening.
<P>
K comes to you and asks you what the City can do to stop her plans
and what she can do to ensure she can carry on with them. Advise
her.
<P>
 3. K also wishes advice on the property talc she is paying on
the cottages and the appropriateness of development charges she would have to pay prior
to the issuing of the building permit.
<P>
She is assessed $10,000.00 including business assessment for each
of 10 old cottages which are old mobile home trailers. She paid
$50,000.00 each for them but their current value is $5,000.00
each.
<P>
There are no mobile home parks in the municipality but motels
are assessed at 60% of market value while small houses are assessed
at 50% of market value. Should she appeal her assessment?
<P>
With respect to the development charges, she has been told she
will have to pay a special levy of $50,000.00 towards the lake
remediation fund based on the square footage of the concrete pad
prior to the issuing of a building permit. All developers in the
area are paying the levy on the same square footage basis. The
development charges by-law was just passed and includes in it
an amount charged against all development in the municipality
for growth related environmental remediation. K does not want
to pay this portion of the charge and says her property has not
contributed to the pollution of the lake and will not in the future.

The Ashton band of the Miq-maq live on a reserve in Nova Scotia. Since before contact they have fished and hunted deer and other game on the reserve and on adjoining forested land. Until 1990, some of this land was owned in fee simple by Brownwater Mersey, a large pulp and paper company. Brownwater also held logging rights to a much larger stretch of adjoining crown land. In the 1980s Brownwater's logging activities polluted the water on their own land and that on the reserve. From 1987 onwards both the Ashton band and environmental lobby groups sought to have the government prevent this pollution. But government scientists advised that the level of pollution was within existing regulations and the provincial government therefore did not order Brownwater to reduce its Polluting activities.
<p>
In 1990 a new provincial government was elected one more sympathetic to environmentalist concerns. Although somewhat concerned about existing high rates of unemployment, it nonetheless decided to change the regulations in a way that would require Brownwater to reduce its pollution by half. In response Brownwater, already losing money because of the effect of the recession on the industry and seeing an opportunity to make a public relations gesture, offered the provincial government a deal. It was prepared to abandon its logging rights and to give up the lands it owned in fee simple to the provincial government, if, in return, the government would declare the land a provincial park and outlaw all hunting and fishing in the park. Brownwater also insisted that the new park be called the &quot;John Mersey Park's. The government agreed. In part it was motivated by pressure from logging interests elsewhere in the province which did not care for the proposed new regulations; the deal with Brownwater would solve the particular problem without resorting to general changes in the law. In part also it was motivated by the desire to create a tourist attraction, and the new park was widely advertised as such in the US.
<p>
The Ashton band, somewhat dependent on fishing for its livelihood, was left in a difficult position. Although the source of the pollution had been removed, and although time would eventually restore the waters on and off the reserve, no money was forthcoming to reestablish fish stocks depleted by the pollution. Nor was the government prepared to give money for an immediate clean up of the waters on the reserve. In addition, the aforementioned park regulations meant that they could no longer hunt or fish on the neighbouring lands. Instead, they now simply entered the provincial park and held their pre-hunting ceremony, at which they sang the traditional hunting song that they had sung for as long as anyone could remember. The song had originally been about their spiritual relationship with nature and the wild animals they hunted, but the version that was still sung was a later version dating from first contact that told as well of hunting animals to sell to European traders. According to a decision of the elders, the song could only be sung in secret, only at certain times and only by certain members of the band.
<p>
The band leaders decided that if they publicized their situation, public pressure might persuade the government to finance the clean-up and the replenishment of fish stocks. They allowed a TV documentary to be made about their band and its history, but unfortunately few people watched it. Among those who did were the Couch Potatoes, a rap group looking for a hit. They were immediately struck by the hunting song, which had been filmed as part of the documentary, and turned it into a top-ten single and video. Not only did this put the Couch Potatoes on the charts, it also publicized the plight of the Ashton band, embarrassing the government into undertaking the clean-up. The Ashton band, however, is deeply unhappy about their hunting song being played on Much Music. They believe that they should be able to prevent its appropriation.
<p>
The band leaders have decided to seek legal advice. They ask you the following two questions:
<ol>
<li>Does the common law give the band property in the hunting song?
<p>
<li>Can the band assert rights to hunt and/or fish in the John Mersey Park?
</ol>
Please answer these questions, spending half your time on each. In dealing with the first, do not worry about any statutes that might protect intellectual property. If, in answering either question, you decide that you need to know more facts, state what you would want to know, make a reasonable assumption, and continue with your analysis.

<P>
Once upon a time in Fantasyland, Pooh Bear and Raggedy Ann were
taking a stroll along the Yellow Brick Road. Their way led past
the rear of the palace of the Wizard of Oz. The Wizard, who was
a recluse, disliked people, and his palace was surrounded by a
high brick wall, topped with spikes, to discourage visitors.
<P>
Near the outside of the palace wall was a large tree, a branch
of which overhung the interior of the palace grounds. As Pooh
and Ann drew near, Pooh noticed something glistening on that branch,
just inside the palace wall. It appeared that the Goose had laid
a golden egg on it. Pooh asked Ann to help him get it.
<P>
The only way they could reach the egg was by having Ann stand
on Pooh's shoulders. Then, by stretching, her outstretched fingers
could just reach the egg. Moving it a bit, she discovered that
it was hollow, and only made of gold-coloured papier-mache. &quot;That
Goose has been cheating again,&quot; she cried. However, she persevered,
and, by shaking the branch a bit, was able to roll the egg enough
towards her that she was in the course of picking it up when Pooh,
below her, lost his balance. As they dropped to the ground, Ann's
flailing arms sent the egg flying off the branch. It landed on
the road a few feet from Pooh and Ann
<P>
Before either could get to it, a playful heffalump, which had
been grazing near the road, ran over and butted the egg several
feet down the road. Pooh and Ann ran after it, but the Heffalump
kept butting it along the road. Finally, Ann grew tired of chasing
the egg. &quot;Pooh&quot;, she said, &quot;If you want that phoney
egg, as far as I am concerned, it will be all yours if you can get it.&quot;
<P>
Pooh, who was a bear of little brain, and therefore did not discourage
easily, continued to lumber along after the egg. The heffalump
got tired of its game, gave a final butt, and wandered off, out
of our story. However, that final butt had sent the egg flying
onto the land of Toad Hall, the home of Mr. Toad. It landed on
Toad's driveway amidst several boxes of stuff that Toad had just
cleared out of his basement, and was in the process of sending
to his church's rummage sale. One of Toad's servants, who was
loading the boxes into Toad's station wagon, and who had not observed
the egg's rather unusual arrival, thought it had fallen out of
a box, and tossed it on top of one of the boxes already in the
station wagon. Then, the servant went into Toad Hall for more
boxes.
<P>
Pooh, who had observed these events from a distance as he had
followed along after the heffalump, arrived at Toad Hall, went
up the drive, and took the egg from the open back of the
station wagon. As he was examining the egg, Toad, who had observed
him take the egg from the vehicle, came running out and grabbed
it away form him.
<P>
As Pooh was trying to explain that the egg was his, not Toad's,
Toad was examining it closely. He noticed that the egg consisted
of two halves joined to-gether, and by twisting, he separated the halves. Inside was a certificate
entitling the bearer to one bar of gold stored in the vaults of the Fantasyland Bank.
<P>
&quot;Did you know about this?&quot; asked Toad. &quot;No&quot;,
said Pooh, who was very honest. &quot;Then the certificate is
mine&quot; said Toad. &quot;You can have the egg back&quot;. Then
Ann, who had followed along after Pooh out of curiosity, arrived.
&quot;No&quot;, she cried, &quot;the certificate is mine. I got
the egg out of the tree.&quot; &quot;You are all wrong&quot;,
broke in the deep voice of the Wizard of Oz. &quot;It is all mine.&quot;
He had observed the whole episode on his electronic voyeuroscope,
and, his greed overcoming his shyness, had transported himself
to Toad Hall. In the course of the argument which followed, the
Wizard admitted that he had not been aware of the egg's presence
in the tree until he had observed it sailing through the air as
Pooh and Ann fell to the ground.
<P>
<B>On the assumption that the laws of Fantasyland are identical
to those of Ontario, evaluate the respective claims of Pooh, Raggedy
Ann, Mr. Toad and the Wizard, to the gold certificate.</B>

<P>
Recent events have linked tensions in two parts of the world.
<P>
For decades, tensions have been high between Greece and Turkey.
The tensions are based on several outstanding disputes, the most
serious of which is the status of the island Cyprus. Less serious
but just as lasting a dispute has been over rights to the resources
of the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea. As can be seen from
Map I (found in the Annex to this exam), Greek islands closely
abut the Turkish coast. The thick, dark line on Map I indicates
which islands are Greek (those to the left of the line) and which
Turkish (those -- very few -- to the right). Turkey has long taken
the position that it enjoys, on an equitable basis, some maritime
zone rights in waters and on the continental shelf within the
Greek islands of the Aegean; in other words, Turkey does not accept
that the outer fringe of Greek islands should be treated as completely
blocking the generation of zones by the Turkish coast. In the
early 1970s, it acted on this opinion by issuing various resource
exploration permits to companies to explore the continental shelf
that Turkey views as its own; on Map 1, hash marks designate areas
covered by these Turkish permits. In 1978, Turkey and Greece came
close to military confrontation over this continental shelf
delimitation issue. Since 1979, the dispute has been on the back
burner, but newspaper accounts in late November 1994 indicate
that the simmering feud may be about to boil over again. The reason
is that Greece has announced that it will extend its territorial
sea around each Greek island in the Aegean from 6 miles to the
12 miles now permitted by the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention which
has just entered into force in mid-November, Greece has ratified
but Turkey has not (because it feels the Convention provisions
giving islands full jurisdictional entitlement should have been
qualified for situations such as the Aegean). As a fall-out from
the Greek announcement and Turkish response, both Turkey and Greece
have begun staging live ammunition war games in the region
as a display of resolve. With newspapers in each country screaming
headlines about imminent &quot;war&quot;, the U.S., on November
24, 1994, has sent a warship to the area to act as a preventive
buffer.
<P>
Meanwhile, on December 11, 1994, Russia has just sent troops into
Chechenya, indicated on Map 2 (in Annex l) as lying inland from
the Black Sea between Russia and Georgia (both of which are member
states of the UN). Chechenya has a population of 1, 300, 000,
55 % of whom are ethnic Chechens, 15% ethnic Ingushes and 30%
ethnic Russian. Chechenya was acquired by conquest by Russia in
the 1850s and was considered to be a region within the Russian
Soviet Socialist Republic (the RSSR), a constituent republic of
the former Soviet Union (USSR, or Union of Soviet Socialist Republics).
The USSR dissolved into a number of new states in the late 1980s
and early 1990s, the RSSR becoming Russia. Chechenya is considered
by Russia to be one of 21 'autonomous republics' within the state
of Russia, a status which gives the region and its government
significant jurisdictional autonomy which includes the right to
enter into treaties with Russia and with other autonomous republics
within Russia (but not with foreign states). However the Government
of Chechenya considers Chechenya to be an independent state, having
declared its independence in 1991. No other autonomous republic
in Russia has declared independence, although several have used
the Chechenya example as a lever to negotiate favourable treaties
with Russia in return for staying in Russia. This is consistent
with a statement made in November 1993 by Russian President Boris
Yeltsin: &quot;I stand for the nations' [of Russia] right to self-determination
but with a single reservation: excluding the right to secede from
Russia.&quot; Although there are no election results or referendum
results to point to, most experts take the view that the 70% nonRussian
population are overwhelming in favour of Chechenya's secession
and independence, while a clear (but not overwhelming) majority
of Russians are against it. The opposition of many Russian Chechens
exists in spite of clear statutory provisions in Chechen law which
entrench far-ranging minority language, religion and cultural
rights. From the moment of the 1991 declaration of independence,
armed opposition of some Russian Chechens arose with the goal
of keeping Chechenya part of Russia. While Russia has officially
stated that it wishes to solve the issue peacefully, all evidence
shows that it has turned a blind eye to volunteers from the Russian
army going to Chechenya to fight alongside Russian Chechens. Despite
this armed resistance, it is clear that the level of civil conflict
is minor, especially when compared to Bosnia; indeed, it could
not be viewed as having reached the proportions of a civil war.
As a consequence, the Government of Chechenya, based in the capital
of Grozny, has been in control of all of Chechenya with the exception
of a few small and inaccessible mountain areas where the Russian
oppositionists are based. There are functioning municipal governments
appointed by the Grozny Government in every medium-sized to large
town. Police and military forces of the Grozny Government move
freely throughout the country in order to respond to the sporadic
acts of resistance by the opposition. The Chechen situation has
not been the subject of any Security Council recommendation, much
less decision, due to Russia's permanent membership in the Council
and its position that the Chechenya 'secession' is a matter of
domestic jurisdiction. Neither has Chechenya been admitted to
the UN. Indeed, there are only four states which have recognized
it -- Georgia, Greece, Turkey and Armenia. While all evidence
suggests that the underlying motivations for their recognition
is to give each state's oil companies' preferential treatment
in terms of access to the extensive oil fields under Chechenya
(some experts speak of Chechenya as one big oil patch), each state
only recognized Chechenya once it had determined to its own satisfaction
that Chechenya had a functioning government with the loyalty of
the majority of its population (even if there have been no elections
to confirm this) and that the only way its control would be dislodged
would be if Moscow intervened militarily. These states thought
such intervention unlikely because of the factionalism within
the Government, Parliament and Army Command of Russia on the question
of using force to put down rebellions in the outlying regions
of Russia.
<P>
As indicated, Russia has sent its troops into Chechenya on December
11. On December 15, Greece decides to respond to Chechenya's public
claim that it has been attacked by Russia and its request for
assistance in the conduct of its self-defence. It decides to send
a Greek naval ship, the <cite>Spartacus</cite>, with arms. The plan
is to go through the Dardenelles, the Marmasa Sea and the Bosporus
(points B, C and D on Map 1) which link Turkey's territorial waters
in the Aegean Sea to the Black Sea (point E on Map 1). The Black
Sea is considered a part of the ocean space governed by
the law of the sea (i.e. the Black Sea does not consist of
internal waters, but, rather, consists of territorial waters
and exclusive economic zones of its bordering states). The Marmasa
Sea is over 24 miles in width at every point, but both the straits
on either side of it (the Dardenelles connecting the Marmasa Sea
to the Aegean and the Bosporus connecting the Marmasa Sea to the
Black Sea) are under 6 miles in width at every point. Both the
Dardenelles and the Bosporus are the subject of the 1936 Montreux
Convention; both Greece and Turkey are parties to the Convention.
The Montreux Convention gives &quot;freedom of transit&quot; to
light warships subject to only four conditions: (1) that the ship
must be under 10,000 tonnes; (2) that the transit of each strait
must take place in daylight; (3) that the ship must not belong
to a state with which Turkey is currently a belligerent (i.e.
at war); and (4) that Turkey must receive &quot;at least eight
days prior notification&quot; through diplomatic channels of the
intended transit of the straits.
<P>
On December 11, the day of Russia's military intervention in Chechenya
and the day of Chechenya's call for assistance, Greece sends a
diplomatic note to the Turkish Embassy in Athens: &quot;The Government
of Greece hereby notifies the Government of Turkey that, pursuant
to Greece's rights under the 1936 Montreux Convention, the Greek
warship, the <cite>Spartacus</cite> (a ship of 8000 tonnes), will be
transiting the Dardenelles and the Bosporus eight days from now,
on December 19, wholly during daylight hours. The destination
of the <cite>Spartacus</cite> will be the state of Georgia. In view
of recent problems between Greece and Turkey, the Government of
Greece wishes the Government of Turkey to know that the <cite>Spartacus'</cite>
passage through Turkish waters will be entirely peaceful.&quot;
In an effort to de-escalate tensions regarding the Greek-Turkish
conflict in the Aegean, Turkey responds the next day, on December
12, as follows: &quot;The Government of Turkey has no objection
to the passage of the <cite>Spartacus</cite> as described in the Note
of December 11 1994, from the Government of Greece.&quot;
<P>
On December 14, Turkish intelligence discovers that the <cite>Spartacus</cite>
will be carrying arms. Turkish intelligence informs authorities
in Ankara that a normally-reliable source says that the arms are
destined for Georgia from where they will be sent overland to
Chechenya. but that this source's information has not yet been
confirmed as definitively accurate. Meanwhile, the conflict in
Chechenya escalates (as Russian troops converge on the capital
of Grozny) and Greece decides that it is necessary, if its assistance
to Chechenya is not to prove too late, for the date of sailing
to be advanced. On December 15, Greece sends a diplomatic note
to the Turkish Embassy informing it: &quot;For reasons of overwhelming
urgency, the <cite>Spartacus</cite> must sail through the Dardenelles
and the Bosporus immediately, four days earlier than planned.
The Government of Greece wishes to assure the Government of Turkey
that the passage of the <cite>Spartacus</cite> will remain entirely
peaceful.&quot; The Embassy faxes the note to its Foreign Ministry
in Ankara. Within an hour, the <cite>Spartacus</cite> has entered Turkish
territorial waters on the way to the Dardenelles.
<P>
As the <cite>Spartacus</cite> enters Turkish territorial waters, the
Turkish Foreign Ministry in Ankara has only had half an hour to
digest the most recent Greek note notifying Turkey of the immediate
sailing of the <cite>Spartacus</cite>. In light of the recent intelligence
about the nature of the <cite>Spartacus</cite>' cargo, a decision is made to send Turkish warships, led by the <cite>Constantinople</cite>, out to meet the <cite>Spartacus</cite>. The <cite>Spartacus</cite> is ordered
to leave Turkish territorial waters forthwith. The <cite>Spartacus</cite>
is hailed inside Turkish territorial waters (at point A on Map
1, attached in Annex 1), a mile before the Dardenelle Straits.
The <cite>Spartacus</cite> and the <cite>Constantinople</cite> (and its accompanying
ships) heave to while correspondence occurs between Athens (Greece)
and Ankara (Turkey) over the course of a couple hours.
<P>
Turkey informs Greece that the <cite>Spartacus</cite>' passage is considered
by Turkey to be non-innocent under customary international law,
the rules of which, Turkey claims, are reflected in the provisions
of the 1982 <cite>Law of the Sea Convention</cite> dealing with rights
of passage in the territorial waters. In particular, Turkey expresses
the view that, in light of the recent renewal in tensions between
Greece and Turkey over rights in the Aegean, the passage constitutes
a &quot;threat of force against the sovereignty of Turkey&quot;;
to back up this view, Turkey points to the fact that the <cite>Spartacus</cite> carries arms and that this fact had not been disclosed to Turkey by Greece. Greece replies that arms are being sent to Chechenya
in exercise of Greece's lawful right of collective self-defence
to assist the Chechen government in fending of the armed attack
by Russia. Turkey replies that, if this is true, then the passage
is still non-innocent according to custom which also prohibits
passage involving force &quot;in violation of the principles of
international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations&quot;
which, says Turkey, includes sending arms to aid an opposition
movement in a territory which is till part of a sovereign state
like Russia. Turkey adds the view that the right of innocence
passage also does not exist if the ship in question is enroute
to navigation of a strait through which it could not claim rights
of passage; Turkey says that, since the <cite>Spartacus</cite> was passing
four days earlier than the end of the eight day period of notification,
it would not have had Montreux Convention rights to transit the
Dardenelles and Bosporus, and, accordingly, had no rights of innocent
passage through the territorial waters leading to the straits.
At this point, Greece replies that further diplomatic exchange
is undesirable because the <cite>Spartacus</cite>' passage through the
straits is a &quot;matter of necessity&quot;; Greece informs Turkey
that Turkey's only recourse is to bring a diplomatic claim at
a later date. Under instructions from Athens, the <cite>Spartacus</cite>
then heads on towards the Dardenelle Straits. Under instructions
from Ankara, the <cite>Constantinople</cite> fires across the bow of
the <cite>Spartacus</cite> before it can reach the Dardenelles. Athens
decides not to test the matter further and orders <cite>Spartacus</cite>
to return to Greece, which it does without further incident.
<P>
There are speculative indications (but nothing that could be advanced
as evidence in a judicial setting) that Turkey's actual motives
for its actions were not based on actual fears that the <cite>Spartacus</cite>'
arms cargo posed any immediate threat to Turkey, although it is
true that Turkey still had received no corroboration that the
arms were destined for Georgia and on to Chechenya. Firstly, a
new Turkish Government has recently been elected into office.
The new Government views the recognition of Chechenya as a state
by the former Government as having been a particularly striking
act of folly in view of the fact that Turkey has been violently
battling separatist Kurdish forces for decades. In line with this
view of the new Government, the Foreign Ministry judged that allowing
the arms to go through to the Chechens would help set a bad precedent
for a similar arming of the Kurds. Secondly, the Foreign Ministry,
evaluating evidence coming in about the progress of-the Russian
incursion into Chechenya, judged it likely that Russia will prevail
in Chechenya. It is now seen as important for Turkey to send the signal to Russia
that its recognition of Chechenya was premature and therefore
a mistake. Turkey should send the simultaneous signal that Turkey
is now Russia's ally with respect to Chechenya and that it hopes
that, accordingly, Turkish companies will benefit by being given
access to the Chechen oil fields by Russia once the situation
stabilizes. The new Government has not, however, had time, in the few days since
the December 11 incursion, to make any public pronouncement of
any intention to withdraw recognition from Chechenya; its Embassy
in Grozny, capital of Chechenya, continues to operate.)
<P>
<b>The Contemplated Contentious Case</b>
<P>
On December 16, Greece contemplates bringing a suit against Turkey
in the ICJ for breach of its rights of innocent passage in Turkey's
territorial seas. Its claim would be based on the customary law
right of innocent passage, which it views as simply requiring
that passage not be prejudicial to the peace, good order or security
of the coastal state. While Greece is willing to concede that
any &quot;threat of force against the sovereignty&quot; of a coastal
state, as phrased by Turkey, is consistent with the customary
standard of non-innocence, it feels that such a threat cannot
be shown on the facts. With respect to the second justification
offered by Turkey in its reference to &quot;violation of principles
of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations&quot;,
Greece knows that there is overwhelming evidence that this phrase,
drawn verbatim from the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention, was a
development of the customary law on innocent passage (a development
which favoured the coastal state); as such, Greece views this
development as forming part of the over-all package deal locked
into place in 1982 and therefore not capable of becoming custom.
Even if this had become part of the customary test for non-innocence,
Greece takes the view that Turkey could not invoke it due to Turkey's
non-ratification of the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention. Furthermore,
even if Turkey could benefit from such a customary test, Greece
feels that Turkey's interpretation of the test and application
of the test to the facts could not be sustained as Greece was
perfectly within its lawful rights to ship arms to Chechenya in
response to the invasion. Finally, even if Turkey's interpretation
were correct, Turkey had no right to threaten force as it did
in order to resolve the dispute. As for Turkey's arguments regarding
passage being rendered non-innocent because the <cite>Spartacus</cite>
would be violating the Montreux Convention once it reached the
Dardenelles, Greece takes the view that there is no right to prevent
straits passage in advance of actual transit. In any case, its
passage would not violate the Montreux Convention for two reasons:
firstly, because Turkey had waived the need to wait out the entire
eight-day notification period in Turkey's Note of December 12
which replied to Greece's notification; and secondly, because
Greece believed in good faith that it was a matter of utmost necessity
to get arms to the Chechens at all speed.
<P>
As neither Turkey nor Greece have deposited a declaration pursuant
to Art. 36(2) of the <cite>ICJ Statute</cite>, the only possible jurisdictional
basis for the ICJ hearing the case can be found in a 1928 treaty
to which both Greece and Turkey are parties, the <cite>General Act
for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes</cite> (the
General Act). The General Act is generally considered to still
be in force. Art. 17 of the General Act provides that any state
party can unilaterally seize the jurisdiction of the Permanent
Court of International Justice to resolve any dispute between
it and any other state party. Turkey did not make any reservations
to the General Act. However, Greece did make the following reservation
to Art, 17, known as reservation (b) which excludes from the scope
of Art. 17 &quot;(b) questions which by international law are
solely within the domestic jurisdiction of states, and in particular
disputes relating to the territorial status of Greece.&quot;
<P>
<b>Your Task</b>
<P>
You are the Legal Advisor to the Greek Foreign Ministry. On the
basis of the above, advise your Government on the strength of
its legal case if it were to bring the suit against Greece. Be sure to address both the substantive merits (whether Turkey breached Greece's customary rights related to innocent passage) and the
question of jurisdiction (whether the ICJ would rule itself to
have jurisdiction based on Art. 17 of the treaty known as the
General Act). You should spend no morel than 1/5 of your time
on the jurisdictional question.
<P>
<hr>
<p>
<B>Question 2: Note: Annex 2 and Annex 3 are only relevant
for those who choose to make this question worth 67% of their
exam.</b>
<P>
Write an essay which addresses the following general question:
what place do aboriginal peoples and persons have within public
international law?
<P>
Be sure to address the following issues:
<blockquote>
(1) your essay should contain discussion (not all necessarily
in the same depth) of acquisition of territory, self-determination
and territorial integrity of existing states, personality and
recognition, the nature and status of treaties, and human rights;
<P>
(2) your essay should not be limited to a snapshot of the current
state of doctrine, but, rather, should also involve a discussion
of doctrine in historical perspective; and
<P>
(3) in light of your doctrinal account, your essay should give
consideration to what that doctrinal account says (at a more theoretical
level) about public international law as a force for justice,
on the one hand, and an expression of power, on the other hand.
</blockquote>
As a guideline. devote no less than l/5 and no more than 1/4 of
your writing time to issue (3). Your discussion of issue (3) either
may appear all in one section or may be thematically laced throughout
the essay.
<P>
<B>For those who choose Option 2 and therefore decide to make
their answer to Question 2 worth 67%:</b>
<P>
If you decide to make your answer to this question worth 67%
of the exam (that is, to spend two hours on it), <b>at least half
an hour and no more than forty-five minutes</b> should be spent discussing
your views on how, from an international law perspective, we should
think about the proposed declaration of independence by the National
Assembly of Quebec in terms of how that declaration (and its legal
effects) relates to the rights of indigenous peoples in Quebec,
such as the Cree and Inuit in the north and the Mohawks in the
south. For this purpose, you should structure this part of your
essay as an engagement with Annex 2 and Annex 3.
<P>
Annex 2 is the draft bill that the Government of Quebec has tabled
in the National Assembly of Quebec. The Government's plan is to
finalize the language of the bill after public hearings across
Quebec, most notably by using the input from those hearings to
assist in the phrasing of the as-yet-unwritten Preamble to the
bill. At that point, the finalized bill will be voted on in the
National Assembly and then put to a referendum vote for the population
of Quebec; the referendum question is found at the end of the draft bill contained in Annex 2. With
respect to the draft bill, concentrate on sections 1, 3, 4, 7
and 8.
<P>
Annex 2 is a report of a gathering of leaders of First Nations
from across Quebec along with the leadership of the pan-Canadian
organization, the Assembly of First Nations (the AFN). Note the
claims being made about: (1) the territorial integrity of Quebec
and the legal status of Quebec's borders if it were to separate;
(2) the existence of various treaties with Canada; (3) the human
rights of First Nations; and (4) rights of self-determination.
<P>
Note that both the Government of Quebec and the various First
Nations have invoked international law as being dispositively
in favour of their particular claims as contained in Annex 9 snow
Annex 3

Option 3: Do six of the eight questions in Part 2; your answers will be collectively worth 100% and you
should accordingly spend l/2 hour on each of the six questions, for a total of 3 hours.
<P>
NOTE: If you are doing Option l or Option 2, you should avoid more than incidental overlap with your answer
in Part l.
<P>
Question 3:</b> Are companies which are nationals of states which have not ratified the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention permitted under international law to harvest manganese nodules from the
floor of the deep sea-bed as of today's date?
<P>
Are all non-parties (and thus their nationals) to be treated the
same or, rather, can the answer vary from non-party to non-party?
<P>
<b>Question 4:</b>
<blockquote>
&quot;It is true to say that reciprocity is the cement of international
law. Therefore, it follows that states, equal in their sovereignty,
are the foundational building blocks of the international legal
system.&quot;
</blockquote>
Discuss.
<P>
<B>Question 5:</B>
<blockquote>
&quot; Saying versus doing. The tension between these two kinds of behaviour plagues any attempt
to identify what is or is not an international legal norm.&quot;
</blockquote>
Discuss.
<P>
<B>Question 6:</b>
<blockquote>
&quot;<cite>Temple of Preah Vihear</cite> and <cite>Texaco v Libya </cite>are cut from the same hegemonic cloth. Each are testimony to the Eurocentrism that masquerades itself as international law.&quot;
</blockquote>
Comment.
<P>
<B>Question 7:</b>
<blockquote>
&quot;Art. 2(5), 25, and 103 of the <cite>UN Charter</cite> make clear that a Security Council resolution generates peremptory obligations, at least when it is clear that the Council is acting in defence of international
peace and security. <cite>Jus cogens</cite> norms also generate peremptory obligations.  How, then, can it be justified, as Bosnia argues, to trump Resolution  713 obligations to respect an arms embargo by calling in aid
<cite>jus cogens</cite> norms relating to genocide? The answer is that it cannot be  justified. Thus, this means that the Security Council must be left to exercise its judgment as it sees fit without interference from the ICJ flying the <cite>jus cogens</cite> banner.&quot;
</blockquote>
Discuss.
<P>
<B>Question 8:</b> Does current international law recognize
a doctrine of 'democratic welcome', that is to say, the right
of elected leaders who are not in actual governmental power (like
Endarra of Panama and Aristide of Haiti) to invite in outside
military assistance to oust the government in power? If such a
right exists, was it equally available to both Endarra and Aristide?
<P>
Make sure to make reference to the views of Reisman and Hargrove
and any relevant views expressed in the <cite>Nicaragua</cite> case.
<P>
<b>Question 9:</b> Would it be accurate to say that
international law operates only in partnership with equity?
<P>
<b>Question 10:</b>
<blockquote>
&quot;Rhetoric without representation. That sums up what is most problematic about the accounts of international law offered by Koskenniemi, Kratochwil and Scobie.&quot;

<P>
<cite>The Globe and Mail</cite>, Dec. 14, 1994, A6
<P>
Stop separatists, PM urged
<P>
Quebec would trample aboriginal rights, native leaders fear
<P>
BY RH&Eacute;AL S&Eacute;GUIN<br> Quebec Bureau
<P>
QUEBEC-The Assembly of First Nations wants Prime Minister Jean
Chretien to step in and put a stop to Quebec separatism, calling
it a violation of aboriginal treaty rights and a denial of natives'
international human rights.
<P>
National leader Ovide Mercredi told delegates gathered yesterday
for a special meeting of the Assembly of First Nations that Mr.
Chretien has a responsibility to block any unilateral attempt
by Quebec to separate from Canada.
<P>
&quot;The minimum that the Prime Minister can do is give us
his assurances that he will in fact act on behalf of his legal obligations
to make sure that our rights are not severed by any unilateral
action, whether they are approved by referendum or not, on
the part of the Parizeau government,&quot; Mr. Mercredi said.
<P>
Mr. Chretien's policy of defending the status quo and his refusal
to engage in constitutional talks will lead to failure, Mr. Mercredi
said. He urged Ottawa to consider a different strategy that would
include the needs of both Quebec and the native people.
<P>
Delegates unanimously adopted a resolution stating that Quebec
sovereignty constitutes a threat to inherent aboriginal, treaty,
constitutional and other human rights. It rejected the concept of
the territorial integrity of Quebec, reiterating that the province
could not separate from Canada without the consent of native peoples.
<P>
&quot;The first nations in Canada call on the federal government
to fulfill its historic, treaty, fiduciary and constitutional
obligations to protect and promote the rights of first
nations in Quebec and Labrador; and that we the first nations
in Canada further declare that we will not permit the historic
links and relationships between the first nations inside and outside
Quebec to be infringed or severed,&quot; the motion said.
<P>
The motion is a clear condemnation of the
Quebec government's draft bill on sovereignty and its plans for
public consultation. Native leaders said they will boycott the
government process and initiate their own consultations to define the battle to be fought to stop Quebec
from separating without their consent.
<P>
Mr. Mercredi said the Assembly of First Nations wants a meeting
with Mr. Chretien and premiers to establish how the country's
political leaders will answer the native request for action against
Quebec sovereigntists.
<P>
A delegation will also be sent to the United Nations to argue the
case that Quebec sovereignty poses a threat to the survival of
native peoples. Mr. Mercredi will participate in the native consultation
process in Quebec, with public forums to debate the issue of native
rights.
<P>
Quebec sovereignty dominated the first day of the special meeting
of the Assembly of First Nations.
<P>
&quot;How can aboriginal peoples participate in a process that begins
with the denial of their basic human rights?&quot; said Matthew
Coon Come, chief of the Grand Council of the Crees of Quebec.
He described the consultation process proposed by the Parti Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois
as undemocratic and unconstitutional.
<P>
&quot;Nothing is recognized about the right of aboriginal peoples
to hold their own referendums.... The future of the Cree nation
will be determined by Crees, according to Cree law. This, too,
is our right, which the separatists' sovereignty law denies. &quot;
<P>
Mr. Coon Come said that the descendants of those who oppressed
native people should not be trusted to determine how native rights
should be defined. &quot;We will not allow our rights to be determined
in 1994 and 1995 by the descendants of those who characterized
us . . . as savages, wild creatures, squatters and heathens.&quot;
<P>
Mohawk Chief Joe Norton from the Kahnewake Reserve near Montreal
accused the federal government of lacking the courage to uphold native rights by declaring the draft sovereignty bill illegal.
<P>
Mr. Norton's opening remarks drew attention to the notion of native
separatism: &quot;I beIieve in separatism. I believe in Mohawks separatism if there is such a thing as separatism. &quot;
<P>
Mohawk band councillor Billy Two Rivers made harsh statements
about the white race and what he said was the hidden political
agenda of Mr. Chretien's motives for not getting actively involved
to stop separatism.
<P>
Mr. Two Rivers said it was up to Mr. Chr&eacute;tien to tell the Quebec
government to &quot;get back in line,&quot; arguing that Quebec
separatism amounted to nothing less than a declaration of war
against native people.
<P>
&quot;I have problems with the government in Ottawa,&quot;  he
said. &quot;I think the whole place is loaded with closet separatists,
Chr&eacute;tien being one of them. He's got to corne back home here
and he wants to be welcomed back as a prodigal son.&quot;
<P>
Mr. Coon Come said that the cause of Quebec sovereignty was
based on racist principles that show little concern about international
human rights. &quot;They will not permit their destiny as a distinct
society to be determined by all Canadians. They say to Canada,
'We Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois have the right of self-determination.' ... But then,
in the same breath, they state to the Crees, to the aboriginal
peoples in Quebec, that our rights are subject to, and less than,
the rights of the Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois. &quot;
<P>
Premier Jacques Parizeau's parliamentary assistant on native
affairs, David Cliche, said talks with native nations will continue
to ensure that aboriginal rights would be recognized in a Quebec
constitution.
<P>
Next Monday, the government will unveil a proposal for self-government
for the Attikameks and the Montagnais that could serve as a blueprint
for similar negotiations with other native nations, he said.
<P>
Mr. Cliche said that natives in Quebec should defend their rights
rather than call on Ottawa to protect them.

1. On January 1, 1992, Shirley gave a $150,000.00 mortgage to
Bank A encumbering Greenacre. The mortgage had a term of four
years.
<P>
On June 1, 1992, Shirley sold Greenacre to Malcolm for $180,000.00.
The Land Transfer Tax Affidavit showed that Malcolm paid Shirley
$30,000.00 by certified cheque and assumed a $150,000.00 mortgage.
Prior to closing, Malcolm obtained the consent of Bank A to his
assumption of the mortgage.
<P>
Malcolm began encountering financial difficulties and, in order
to raise cash, he placed a second mortgage on Greenacre in favour
of Bank B on September 1, 1992 in the amount of $40,000.00. Malcolm
also placed a third mortgage on Greenacre in favour of Bank C on February 1, 1993 in the amount of $25,000.00.
<P>
Unfortunately, Malcolm's financial woes continued and he defaulted
under Bank A's mortgage on April 1, 1993 and was never able to
make any monthly payments to Bank A at all after that date.
<P>
Bank A was reasonably confident that Greenacre was still worth
$180,000.00 as of April 1, 1993 and they were in no hurry to take
any steps to enforce their security.
<P>
Malcolm played squash regularly with the Bank Managers at Bank
B and Bank C and he did not want them to know about the difficulties
he was facing. Somehow, he managed to make the monthly
mortgage payments to both Bank B and Bank C and he never defaulted
under either of those mortgages. He also decided to let the two
Bank Managers win regularly in their squash games with him.
<P>
It was not until September of 1994 that Bank A took any enforcement
proceedings under its mortgage. On September 1, 1994, Bank A issued
a power of sale notice to Malcolm, Shirley, and Bank B.
There was an express power of sale right in the mortgage and the
Notice under Power of Sale contained the correct information about
the parties to the mortgage, the property mortgaged and the amounts
owing.
<P>
Bank A had been surprised when one of its loan officers reported
back in the last week of October of 1994, after a visit to Greenacre,
that Malcolm had allowed Greenacre to deteriorate considerably.
Bank A now believed, as of the end of October, 1994, that
Greenacre was only worth $125,000.00-$135,000.00 and real estate
prices were still falling.
<P>
On November 1, 1994, Bank A entered into an agreement to sell
Greenacre to Ann under its power of sale. The purchase price was
$125,000.00. The sale to Ann closed on December 1, 1994. After
payment of real estate commission and legal fees and disbursements,
the net amount Bank A received towards the $153,000.00 now owing
under its mortgage was $116,000.00. Bank A served a Statement
of Claim on Malcolm and Shirley on December 5, 1994 claiming the
$37,000.00 still owing under its mortgage.
<P>
Being the courageous fellow that he is, Malcolm still kept his
weekly squash game on December 6, 1994 with Catherine, the Manager
at Bank C. Just prior to the squash game that day, Malcolm told
Catherine that he had lost Greenacre, that he was now being
sued by Bank A, and that he had no choice but to go bankrupt.
This was the first information Catherine had heard about
Malcolm's financial plight and the sale by Bank A of Greenacre.
Catherine lost all three squash games to Malcolm and rushed
back to her desk at Bank C.
<P>
You are a lawyer and Shirley, Malcolm, Bank B and Bank C all come
to you for advice on December 13, 1994. In an extraordinary ruling,
the Law Society allows you to advise them all. Your overworked
and underpaid articling student, a graduate of the University
of Toronto Law School, advises you immediately that the mortgage
Shirley had given to Bank A did not contain a clause similar to
either the clause in the <cite>Malaviya </cite>case excerpted at the

case excerpted in the second last paragraph of page 992 of your

(a) Describe and explain the legal advice that you would give
each of Shirley, Malcolm, Bank B and Bank C.

1994.

4. John agreed to buy a new residential condominium unit in Toronto
on June 1, 1990 from ABC Ltd., a condominium developer.
At the time of entering into the Agreement of Purchase and Sale,
John received a disclosure statement from ABC Ltd. Construction
of the building had not started as of June 1, 1990.
<P>
John took possession of his unit on the interim occupancy closing
date, which was July 1, 1993. John acquired title to the unit
on November 1, 1994.
<P>
On November 15, 1994, John learned that ABC Ltd. had made changes
to the design of the building at some point after June 1, 1990.
Instead of  the 240 units described in the disclosure statement,
the building contained 260 units. It turns out that ABC Ltd. decided
in November of 1991, just prior to commencing construction of
the building, to eliminate one two-bedroom unit on each floor
and replace it with two one-bedroom units. The net result was
that instead of 20 floors each having 12 units, with a total of
240 units, the building would contain 20 floors each having 13
units, with a total of 260 units. ABC Ltd. never issued
a revised disclosure statement to John or any of the other purchasers.
<P>
John has the following complaints about the change in the building
design:
<blockquote>
(a) Twenty more people will be wanting to use the recreational
amenities in the building (e.g. swimming pool, exercise area,
whirlpool) than originally planned and this could affect John's
use of these facilities.
<P>
(b) The elevator and other assets of the condominium corporation
will be used more extensively because there are twenty more people,
which will be inconvenient and also will mean the elevators need
to be replaced earlier than would otherwise be the case.
<P>
(c) The layout of the floors in the building is fundamentally
different than was the case when John agreed to buy.
<P>
(d) John is very superstitious and he loses sleep when he thinks
about the fact that there are thirteen units on each of the twenty
floors.
</blockquote>
However, John has also learned that the change in one of the two-bedroom
units on each floor has not affected his percentage interest in
the common elements or his percentage contribution to the common
elements.
<P>
You are a lawyer and John comes to see you. He wants to know what
obligations ABC Ltd. had to him and the other purchasers in the
building once they decided in November of 1991 to change one of
the two-bedroom units on each floor in the manner described above.
He also wants to know what his rights were between November of
1991 and November 1, 1994, insofar as this change was concerned.
Finally, John wants to know what his legal rights are now with
respect to what has transpired.
<P>
Please provide John with the information he has requested.

and Sale to sell Blackacre to Martha. The purchase price was $200,000.00.
Martha paid a $10,000.00 deposit at the time the agreement was
signed. The deposit was paid to the listing broker, to be held
by them in trust pending the completion of the transaction. The
balance of the purchase price was to be paid on closing. The form
of Agreement of Purchase and Sale utilized was identical to the
Toronto Real Estate Board form contained on pages 9 and 10 of
your casebook. The closing date was set for December 31, 1994
and requisitions were due by October 30, 1994.
<P>
On October 10, 1994, the vendor delivered to the purchaser a copy
of a survey of Blackacre done several years ago. In examining
the survey, Martha's solicitor notices that the fence running
along the entire eastern boundary of the property encroaches
by one foot onto the property to the east.
<P>
When Martha's solicitor sent her requisition letter to Barry's
solicitor on October 20, 1994, she referred to the encroachment
by the fence onto the adjoining property and requested satisfactory
evidence that the fence had been in this location for over
ten years, in order to establish that possessory title had been
acquired by Barry or his predecessors in title.
<P>
On November 15, 1994, Barry's solicitor wrote to Martha's solicitor
indicating that the fence had only been constructed three
years ago and that adverse possession of the one foot encroachment
could not be established. Barry's solicitor also indicated
that, so far as he was concerned, this was not a serious issue
and that Martha should take title, notwithstanding the
one foot encroachment. Martha is concerned that the owner of
the property to the east may realize that the fence encroaches
by one foot onto the property to the east and will require
that the fence be relocated to its proper place on the boundary
between the two properties. This would mean that Martha would
have one foot less along the full length of the eastern
boundary of Blackacre.
<P>
As matters proceed towards the scheduled closing, it becomes apparent
that:
<blockquote>
(a) Barry cannot provide any answer to Martha which would reasonably
satisfy her with respect to the encroachment by the fence onto the adjoining
property.
<P>
(b) Another purchaser had come in with an Offer to Purchase the
property from Barry about twenty-four hours after-Martha's offer
had been accepted and Barry is prepared to return Martha's deposit
to her and sell the property to this other purchaser.
<P>
(c) Martha dabbles frequently in the real estate market and her
usual pattern is to acquire a property, do some minor renovations,
rent it out for several years and then re-sell it at a profit.
<P>
(d) Martha never thought that Barry would accept the Offer at
the price of $200,000.00. In Martha's view, the property is probably
worth about $225,000.00. She is anxious to complete the transaction.
<P>
(e) it is Martha's position that she is entitled to acquire Blackacre
as she saw it, without the risk of losing one foot along the entire
length of the eastern boundary of Blackacre. From her experience
in buying and selling properties over the past ten years, it is
her view that Barry should reduce the purchase price which he
agreed to in the September 1, 1994 Agreement to reflect the fact
that Martha will not be getting exactly what she bargained for.
</blockquote>
You are a lawyer who has been consulted separately by both Barry's
solicitor and Martha's solicitor. Again, the Law Society has allowed
you to provide advice to each of them. They have asked you to
advise them as to what their respective client's rights are and
what steps they should take in order to protect their respective
client's position and maximize their chances of success in any
subsequent litigation. In your analysis, please examine what steps
should be taken prior to the closing, at the closing, and after
the closing.

<b>Question 1</b> (1 hour)<br>
TO BE ANSWERED BY ALL STUDENTS
<p>
Sparafucile, Inc., is a designer and manufacturer of commercial and military jet aircraft. In the summer of 1993, it purchased several personal computers from Rigoletto Business Machines, Ltd. (RBM). Since Sparafucile intended to have its engineers use these computers in designing aircraft, it required computers that could perform millions of operations per hour. Sparafucile's head buyer read RBM's advertising brochure relating to the RBM-600 model. The brochure stated that the RBM-600 contained the fastest microprocessing chip then available, the Sextium, manufactured by Gilda, Inc. The brochure had on the upper right of every page Gilda's well-known slogan, &quot;Gilda Inside&quot;, and it stated that no commercially marketed Gilda microprocessor had ever made an error. Sparafucile ordered and paid for 10 RBM-600s on 27 July 1993 and received them in August 1993. Each RBM-600 came with a guarantee that reads as follows:
<blockquote>
RBM guarantees all parts and components for one year. If any of the components of this RBM-600 fails within a year of the date of purchase, we will replace it free of charge. This guarantee excludes all other warranties and conditions, statutory or otherwise, express or implied, and limits our liability to the cost of replacing any defective component.
</blockquote>
Unknown to anyone at the time, the Sextium contained a flaw that caused it to make, on average, one error every 1 billion operations. A flaw of this sort would not make any real difference if the machine was used for word processing, but it would inevitably manifest itself at some point in the sort of calculations done by Sparafucile's engineers; as indeed it did. In March 1994, a Sparafucile pilot test-flew a new fighter jet designed by engineers who had used the RBM-600. The jet crashed soon after takeoff; the pilot was able to eject and was not seriously injured. The cause of the crash was traced to a flaw in the design of the wing, which in turn was traced to an error made by one of the 10 RBM-600 purchased the preceding summer. This incident led Gilda to investigate the design of the Sextium chip, and the flaw was uncovered in May 1994. Gilda immediately issued a warning to all known purchasers, including Sparafucile, and entered into negotiations with RBM and other computer manufacturers with a view to replacing all the flawed Sextium chips when a functioning model became available, and to setting up a fund to compensate any customers who had suffered consequential losses.
<p>
Advise Sparafucile.
<p>
<b>Question 2</b> (1 hour)<br>
To BE ANSWERED BY ALL STUDENTS
<p>
Walter runs a violin store on Church Street where he sells and repairs stringed instruments of all sorts. He frequently takes violins from musicians, sometimes on consignment, sometimes with instructions to obtain an offer to purchase, and sometimes buying them in his own right and reselling them. Elizabeth is a violinist. In April 1994, she went to Walter's Violin Shop to purchase a new violin. Walter personally assisted her in trying out various violins, but she was unsatisfied with all of them, and didn't purchase any. Late one evening about a week later, after looking unsuccessfully in several other violin shops, she ran into Walter on Yonge Street. Walter happened to be carrying a violin with him at the time, and he said, &quot;This violin is just what you want -- it was made in 1756 by Hans Sachs and was formerly owned by the great Pogner, who says it's the second-best violin he has ever played.&quot; Elizabeth, who had a very high opinion of Pogner, said, &quot;If it's good enough for Pogner, it's good enough for me -- I'll take it.&quot; She gave Walter a cheque for the violin on the spot and took it away without looking at it or trying it out.
<p>
On arriving home, Elizabeth was disappointed to discover that the violin was, in her opinion, no better than the one she already owned. On examining the inside of the violin, she discovered that although it was made by Hans Sachs, it was dated 1776. The next day, she contacted Walter, who refused to take the violin back. She then contacted Pogner himself, who asserted that, although the violin was certainly not the second-best he had ever played, it was in his opinion an adequate instrument for a player of Elizabeth's calibre. Hut he also told her that the violin still belonged to him. He had given it to Walter the previous day to have some minor adjustments made to the bridge; he and Walter were then to discuss the possibility of selling the violin, but they had made no firm arrangements in this regard. He demanded that Elizabeth return the violin to him. Elizabeth said that she would not return it until she was sure she could get her money back from Walter. She then attempted to stop payment on her cheque to Walter, but her bank informed her that the cheque had already been cashed.
<p>
(a) Advise Elizabeth, on the assumption that she is a professional violinist.
<p>
(b) Advise Elizabeth, on the assumption that she is a physician who enjoys playing the violin in her spare time.
<p>
<b>Question 3</b> (1 hour)<br>
TO BE ANSWERED ONLY BY STUDENTS WHO CHOSE EVALUATION OPTION (a)
<p>
In its 1979 Report on Sale of Goods, the Ontario Law Reform Commission (OLRC) recommended replacing the current rules regarding risk of loss with a provision similar to &#167;2-509 of the Uniform Commercial Code (see pp. 352-353 of the casebook), which generally transfers risk when possession is transferred from buyer to seller.
<p>
(i) Outline the current rules regarding risk of loss under the <cite>Sale of Goods Act</cite>.
<p>
(ii) How would Richard Posner analyze the effects of the OLRC recommendation?
<p>
(iii) Since parties can, and frequently do, contract out of the current rules (see, for instance, Condition 2 in the Westinghouse standard form on p. 1387 of the Casebook), would the change proposed by the OLRC have any real advantages?

<P>
<b>Marks 30 QUESTION 1</b>
<P>
Leasco, a well known leasing company, has agreed to finance the Nu  Trucking Company's (NUTCO) acquisition of a fleet of cabs and trailers. The  parties agreed that when so requested by NUTCO Leasco would purchase a  specified cab and/or trailer from the manufacturer and lease it to NUTCO for a 5 year period for 80 per cent of the manufacturer's list price. The parties signed a master agreement embodying these terms.
<P>
In January 1990 NUTCO leased 5 cabs and trailers from Leasco under the master agreement. On January 30, 1990, Leasco filed a financing statement with the PPS registry in Toronto. Owing to a clerical error in Leasco's office NUTCO's name appeared as &quot;New Truck Company&quot; in the 'debtor' portion of the financing statement. The parts of the financing statement dealing with the collateral, in addition to classifying the collateral as inventory,
also contained a description of the cabs and trailers, including the vehicle identification numbers (VINS).
<P>
In June 1993, Leasco agreed to finance 5 more cabs and trailers on the same leasing terms as before, and Leasco filed a new financing statement on June 15, 1993. This spelled NUTCO's name correctly and showed an &quot;X&quot; in the equipment collateral box, but contained no specific description of the cabs and trailers.
<P>
Because of the recession, NUTCO fell into arrears with its leasing payments. On December 1, 1993, without prior warning, Leasco terminated all the leasing agreements and attempted to repossess the 10 cabs and trailers. However, the bailiff could only locate 2 of the cabs and trailers leased in January 1990 and 3 of the cabs and trailers leased in June 1993. On December 15, 1993, NUTCO made an assignment in bankruptcy. The leases were recorded in NUTCO's accounting ledgers and would have come to the trustee's attention in reviewing NUTCO's financial affairs.
<P>
ADVISE the trustee in bankruptcy:
<blockquote>
(a) whether the leases were governed by the OPPSA;
<P>
(b) whether, assuming the leases did fall under the Act, (I) the financing statements of January 1990 and June 1993, or either of  them, perfected Leasco's security interest in the cabs and trailers and, if so which; and (ii) whether the bailiff's repossession of the described units was effective to perfect the security interest in them; and
<P>
(c) whether Leasco was entitled to repossess the cabs and trailers without prior notice to NUTCO.
</blockquote>
<b>Marks 30 QUESTION 2</b>
<P>
&quot;Red Riding Hood&quot; (RRH), a medium sized company, owns a chain of men's and ladies apparel stores across Canada. Dorothy and Abe own all the shares in the company. RRH was badly hit by the recent recession.
It was forced to close half of its stores and to lay off much of its staff. The company's capital reserves were used up. Nevertheless, RRH limped along hoping that an improving economy would change its fortunes. The revival has
been very slow. RRH is facing a new fiscal crisis unless a solution can be found to its problems. The company's principal creditors and the amounts owing to them are the following:
<P>
<b>Bank of Kanada.</b> RRH has a line of credit with the bank, repayable on demand, on which $250,000 is currently outstanding. The bank's loan is secured by a security interest in all of RRH's inventory and receivables.
<P>
<b>Landlords.</b> RRH has leases with three landlords covering its 12 remaining stores. The leases have five years to run. $10,000 is owing in rental arrears. RRH would like to disclaim six of the leases on stores in the least
profitable locations.
<P>
<b>Revenue Canada.</b> $25,000 is owing for unremitted tax deductions from employee wages and CPP contributions, and for collected GST.
<P>
<b>Utilities</b> (electricity, water and natural gas): $5,000.
<P>
<b>Suppliers of inventory.</b> $50,000. None of the suppliers has a security interest. Goods are supplied on a 30-60 days' open credit basis.
<P>
On the asset side, RRH has inventory on hand with a book value of $200,000 and a credit balance in the bank of $50,000. Dorothy and Abe feel that if they can keep RRH's creditors at bay for the next 12 months, an improving economy should restore the company to a profitable position.
<P>
ADVISE THEM:
<blockquote>
 (a) if a formal restructuring effort is to be made, whether RRH should proceed under the CCAA or under Part III of the BIA, and why;
<P>
(b) what impact a stay order will have on the rights of the creditors listed above; and
<p>
 (c) how successful RRH is likely to be in disclaiming the 6 leases.
</blockquote>
<center><b>PART B</b><br>
(Answer <b>ANY TWO</b> Questions)</center>
<P>
<b>QUESTION 3</b>
<P>
8 Marks (a) &quot;The concept that bankruptcy law is predominantly a statutory pooling arrangement for the collection and distribution of net assets among an insolvent debtor's creditors is, in Canada at least, largely a fiction. Time and again, a bankruptcy is primarily secured-creditor-driven. Both judicial decisions and the BIA provisions themselves sanction this result.&quot; DO YOU AGREE?
<P>
12 Marks (b) Canuck, an automobile manufacturer, supplies vehicles to Mobilium on a conditional sale basis. Mobilium has a line of credit of $50,000 with the New Bank Of Toronto (NBT), which is secured by a general assignment of accounts. Both Canuck and NBT have registered financing statements. NBT's statement was registered on November 1, 1993; Canuck's statement was registered on February 1, 1994.
<P>
NBT's agreement with Mobilium provides that whenever there is more than $10,000 to the credit of Mobilium's current account with the bank, the bank may offset the excess against any monies owing to it by Mobilium. NBT knew that Canuck was financing Mobilium's new cars although it never received a formal notice from Canuck
to this effect.
<P>
On April 1, 1994, Mobilium sold at retail 3 autos supplied by Canuck and not yet paid for by Mobilium. The proceeds consisted of 2 traded-in used vehicles and cheques for the balance. Mobilium deposited the cheques in its account with NTB. This brought the credit balance in its account to over $10,000 and NBT credited the difference to the loan account.
<P>
ADVISE Canuck:
<blockquote>
(a) whether NBT is accountable to it for the deposited cheques;and
<P>
(b) whether it is entitled to claim the traded-in vehicles.
</blockquote>
<b>QUESTION 4</b>
<P>
 8 Marks (a) &quot;Although the OPPSA provisions are quite clear, Saunders J's decision in the Servex Computer case and other Ontario judgments show that the courts are reluctant to accept the fact that the Act has abolished the
distinction between fixed and floating security interests. This can only lead to much conceptual confusion&quot;.
<br>
 DISCUSS.
<P>
 12 Marks (b) &quot;Uppercrust&quot; is a retailer of expensive chesterfields and other upholstered furniture manufactured by BiltRite. Uppercrust's practice is to take individual orders from customers and to remit them to Biltrite for execution. Uppercrust requires a 25 per cent downpayment from the customer at the time of taking an order, with the balance of the price being payable before delivery of the furniture to the customer. Under the terms of its agreement with Uppercrust, Biltrite retained a security interest in all furniture ordered by Uppercrust so long as any monies were owing to it by Uppercrust.
<P>
Renate, George and Kathy each placed an order with Uppercrust for a custom built chesterfield and upholstered chairs. Uppercrust remitted these orders to Biltrite without disclosing the customers' names. Renate and George fully paid for their furniture; Kathy only made a 25 per cent downpayment. The furniture was awaiting delivery to Uppercrust when Uppercrust became bankrupt. Biltrite refuses to release the furniture to Renate, George and Kathy because monies are still owing to it be Uppercrust.
<P>
ADVISE Renate, George, and Kathy with respect to their rights under the OPPSA.
<P>
<b>20 Marks QUESTION 5</b>
<P>
&quot;Consensual secured creditors would like to feel they are the only game in town; they are profoundly mistaken. The 1992 amendments to the BIA show that the Crowns have significantly improved their positions
and we may be sure they will continue to seek further improvements. Ditto for unpaid suppliers. Wage earners emerged very poorly but we may confidently assume that Parliament cannot much longer defer coming to grips with this problem as well.&quot;<br>
EXPLAIN whether you agree with these observations.

[85 marks] 1. Royal Tobacco Inc. (&quot;Royal&quot;) was incorporated in Ontario in 1966 for the purpose of carrying on the business of manufacturing and selling tobacco products in Canada and abroad. Since its inception, Harold has owned 60 percent of the issued shares, the remainder of which are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
<P>
Harold has always believed in real estate as a sound investment. In 1968, he purchased a home in the Moore Park district of Toronto for $180,000 ($100,000 for the land and $80,000 for the building). Two years later, his wife Marie used her inheritance to acquire a summer home on Lake Muskoka for $90,000 ($60,000 for the land
and $30,000 for the building). Although they were aware that property values were rising, Harold and Marie were upset to learn in January 1972 that municipal assessors had valued the Moore Park property at $220,000 ($120,000 for the land and $100,000 for the building) and the Muskoka cottage at $130,000 ($80,000 for the land and $50,000 for the building).
<P>
Royal had prospered over the years and Harold could foresee the day when it would have to build an addition to the plant. In anticipation of this event, Harold acquired a parcel of real estate that was immediately adjacent to the plant for $500,000 ($300,000 for the land and $200,000 for the building), in the expectation that he would sell it to the company when the need arose. He rented the property to a neighbouring business for use as a car park.
<P>
A matter of mounting concern to Royal was the repeated criticism of the company by the anti-smoking lobby, which was having an adverse effect on sales and cash flow. In order to secure additional working capital, the company floated a five-year bond issue in January, 1990. The bonds had a face value of $100, bore interest at 8 percent, were issued for $95, and were redeemable in January 1995 for $103.
<P>
To Matilda, a widow, the terms seemed attractive. She purchased 200 bonds for $95 each.
<p>
The bond issue was well received. With part of the proceeds, the company purchased a luxury condominium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Although the condo was available to Harold throughout 1991, he and Marie and their daughter Salome occupied it for a total of only eight weeks that year. The rental for comparable accommodation was $2,000 per month. In its books, Royal charged as expenses the cost of transportation and entertainment for the family in
respect of the Florida trips ($4,000), maintenance costs of the condo ($5,500), and capital cost allowance ($3,500). Apart from their occupancy, the condo remained vacant.
<P>
Happiness for Harold and Marie in Florida was an ephemeral thing. Harold was greatly distressed when, in March 1992, Marie was shot to death outside the condo by hoodlums. She  bequeathed her cottage to Harold (fair market
value of the land: $120,000 and of the building: $70,000).
<P>
Harold's grief was interrupted by the increasingly strident complaints of the anti-smoking lobby. Royal decided to fight back vigorously. It brought to Toronto on April 1,1994 from its research facility in Tillsonburg, Ontario (the heartland of tobacco farming) Dr. Omar Wetlaufer, a well-known tobacco scientist, who, in 1992, had won the Canada Science Council prize of $20,000 for his work in developing low-nicotine strains of tobacco. Omar Would work with the public relations department in telling the tobacco industry story.
<P>
As Director of Research, Omar's salary was $70,000 per annum.
<P>
Harry granted Omar an option to purchase 10,000 of Harry's shares in Royal for $6 each over the next five years. The shares were then trading at $8.00. Omar exercised the option in July 1994, when the shares were trading at $10.
<P>
Royal made available to Omar a new automobile, which cost $35,000, and a parking space at the plant. In 1994, Omar drove the car 40,000 kilometres, 37,000 of which were on company business. Royal paid all the operating expenses. (Omar wondered whether he would be better off giving up the company car and, instead, using the family car, for which he would have been paid 0.35 per kilometre.)
<P>
To assist Omar and his wife, Gretchen, to settle in Toronto, Royal provided him with mortgage assistance. Because the cost of housing in Toronto was greater than the cost of housing in Tillsonburg, the company paid directly to his new Toronto mortgagee a formula-derived subsidy to assist him in meeting his increased interest charges on the higher mortgage assumed by him on the purchase of his Toronto residence, a &quot;charming&quot; older house.
<P>
In August 1994, it became apparent that the house required extensive renovations. Royal made an interest-free loan to Gretchen in the amount of $60,000 for this purpose. She provided security for the loan, which was repayable in five years.
<P>
At meetings of representatives of the tobacco industry, Harold met Walter, an executive who lived in North Carolina. During dinner one evening, Harold learned that Walter wished to dispose of his shares in Acme Hardware Inc., an Ontario company controlled by members of the Acme family of Ottawa, who were friends of Walter. Harold knew the company was profitable and believed it to be well-managed and so purchased Walter's shares for $50 each. Walter had acquired them some years earlier for $20 each.
<P>
In its ongoing dispute with the anti-smoking lobby, Royal was especially concerned about the municipal election to be held in November, when the electors would vote on a proposed bylaw that would prohibit the sale of tobacco products in pharmacies, prohibit smoking in all public places and impose other constraints on tobacco use. The by-law would almost certainly be emulated in other parts of Canada. Hence, its enactment would have a devastating effect on Royal's operations. The company spent $1,500,000 in TV advertising, literature distribution and other public relations measures to defeat the by-law.
<P>
A month before the election, it appeared from all indications that the by-law would be approved by a large majority. One result was that the company's bonds fell to $90 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Royal instructed its stock broker to buy on the open market, for cancellation, as many of the bonds as became available. About half the issue was acquired for $90.
<P>
Another result was the company's decision to abandon its plans to build an addition to the plant. It discarded the drawings and blueprints that had been prepared by a firm of architects at a cost of $30,000.
<P>
Miraculously, the by-law did not receive the requisite voter support and was defeated. The fortunes of the company immediately rose. 
<P>
In gratitude for Omar's extraordinary efforts on behalf of the company, Royal forgave the loan to Gretchen early in 1995.
<P>
The remaining bonds were redeemed in January 1995 for $103. Matilda had sold 100 of her bonds for $90 in October 1994 and redeemed the other 100 for $103 in January 1995.
<P>
Omar decided in March that his true interest lay in research and not in politics. He took a senior position for a three year term in Royal's research facility in Indonesia to assist in the development of tobacco farming in that country. His salary was increased to $80,000 which, together with his interest income and dividends totalling $30,000, left him in comfortable circumstances, although he thought that the burden of Canadian income tax on income of
that level, about $40,000, was too high. He expected to return to Canada from time to time to visit his wife, who chose to remain behind. He considered selling his shares for $20 each before leaving Canada, but decided to keep them.
<P>
Regrettably, after only seven months in Indonesia, Omar contracted a rare tropical disease and died. Royal received life insurance proceeds of $500,000.
<P>
The stress of business affairs, Omar's death, and advancing years took their toll of Harold. He passed away in 1996, leaving to his daughter, Salome, his Moore Park House (fair market value of the land: $250,000 and of the building: $150,000), the Muskoka cottage (fair market value of the land: $140,000 and of the building: $90,000) and the property adjacent to the plant (fair market value of the land $450,000; fair market value of the building: $50,000
and undepreciated capital cost of $130,000).
<P>
Discuss the tax consequences of these events for Harold, Marie, Royal Tobacco, Omar, Gretchen, Walter, Matilda, and Salome. Suggest appropriate tax minimization measures they should consider.
<P>
[15 marks] 2. You are a legislative assistant to a newly elected Member of Parliament, who is interested in the Canadian tax system. He asks you to prepare a short memorandum critically analyzing and commenting on the income tax treatment of prizes. Prepare it.

In late September, ABC Co. bought a large building in the commercial district of Flavelle, planning to convert it to a new use. This was going to require extensive renovations. While financing was secured for the renovations, plans drawn up, and the chosen contractor finished off its previous commitments, the building was empty.
ABC Co. had strong locks put on the doors and boarded up the windows. Nevertheless, teenage gangs soon invaded the building. Shortly after the building was boarded up, on a routine patrol one night, police discovered a number of unauthorized people in the building and evicted them. They then notified ABC Co. of the break in and suggested that ABC Co. hire a security guard for the period during which the building would be empty. ABC Co. considered this but decided that a security guard was too expensive: there was nothing in the building to steal, and the invaders could do little damage to the building since there was nothing but four bare walls and the building would be undergoing extensive renovations anyway. In the face of the owner's indifference, the police made no special effort to protect the building from break-ins. If a patrol happened to come across teenagers trying to break in they would stop them and evict anyone in the building, but they went no further.
<P>
After three weeks, XYZ Inc., whose business occupied the adjoining building, complained to ABC Co. that the transient night time occupants of ABC Co.'s building were leaving their garbage behind, including food scraps which had attracted rats to the building. The rats were beginning to invade XYZ Inc.'s building. XYZ Inc. asked ABC Co. to clean up the building and secure it against further break in. ABC Co. sent a clean up crew to the building and the existing garbage was cleaned up. However, still thinking that a security guard was too expensive to ensure the protection of the building, ABC Co. merely arranged to board up the points of access that had been being used.
<P>
Two nights later, the night time temperature went down to 5 &#176; C, and the gangs, who had once more broken in, brought some scrap lumber they found nearby into the building and built a fire. The fire got out of control and spread to XYZ Inc.'s building, causing considerable damage.
<P>
The owner of XYZ Inc. has come to you for advice about whether she has a cause of action in negligence against ABC Co. Analyze the negligence issues in the case, making sure to support your analysis by reference to the case law.

As a by-product of its manufacturing processes Darth Vader Industries produces an immense amount of tar, which it stores in very tall tanks on its property. When Darth Vader set up its operations on this site decades ago, the surrounding land was used for dairy farming. Over the years a residential community grew up as the dairy farmers sold their land to developers. The developers in turn built houses and sold them to the present residents. This residential community now extends right up to the boundary of the Darth Vader factory.
<P>
The residents living closest to Darth Vader have several complaints about the tanks of tar: the tanks are extremely ugly. they emit a noticeable stench, they lower property values, and their height interferes with the cable television reception. Accordingly, the residents are contemplating suing for nuisance.
<P>
Moreover, the tanks leak tar into the corner of a public area. The residents have long complained about this leaking. Darth Vader Industries has refused to do anything about it because the cost of repairs far exceeds the inconvenience or risk that the leaking occasions, especially since everyone who lives in the neighbourhood knows to stay away from that corner of the public area.
<P>
Among the residents is the Palooka family. One day the Palookas were visited by relatives from out of town, including eight-year-old Joe. Joe wandered off into the public area and was attracted to the pool of tar. He sloshed around in it until the tar ruined his shoes and covered his skin from his knees down. When Joe returned to the Palooka residence, his parents, who knew that applying gasoline is the most effective way of removing tar, rubbed his legs with gasoline. At that very moment, the Palooka's young son entered, firing his toy cap pistol. Unfortunately, a spark from the cap pistol ignited the gasoline being rubbed on Joe's legs, causing severe burning.
<P>
Discuss Darth Vader's tort liability on these facts. Where appropriate, set out the different possible approaches to liability and briefly assess the justice or the desirability of these approaches.

<b>Q1.</b> In 1985, Tessa made a valid will, by which she gave all of her property to her sister Doris. Reliable Trust Company was named as the executor of that will.
<P>
Two days ago, Tessa died unexpectedly. Yesterday, Doris brings to you a sealed, stamped, envelope, which Doris had found, unmailed, on Tessa's desk, shortly after Tessa's death. The envelope is addressed to you, at your law firm. You had prepared Tessa's 1985 will for her.
<P>
Inside the envelope was a typed letter to you, dated the day prior to Tessa's death. It reads:
<blockquote>
December 18, 1994
<P>
&quot;Dear Lawyer,
<P>
I have decided to change my will. Originally, I thought I would do it myself, so I got a form at an office supply store and used it. Then, I got worrying about whether I had done it right, or if it was effective, so I decided to send it to you, and let you recast it in lawyer-like language.
<P>
As you see, I am giving my nephew, Edward, the son of my late brother William, a share of my property equal to that of my sister Doris. Doris will inherit a lot from her rich husband, and Edward didn't get much from William's estate, so I feel obliged to help him out.
<P>
Please let me know as soon as your version of my will is ready.
<P>
(signed) Tessa Teapotte&quot;
</blockquote>
Enclosed with this letter was a printed will form which Tessa had bought at an office supply store. The form read as follows: [The words in <I>italics </I>were printed on the form by the publisher. The non-italicized words were written by Tessa.]
<blockquote>
<I>&quot; This is the last will and testament of me, </I>Tessa Teapotte, <I>of the of </I>Toronto <I>in the Province of </I>Ontario, <I>made this </I>17th <I>day of </I>December 1994.
<P>
<I>I revoke all wills and testamentary instruments by me heretofore made.</I>
<P>
<I>I give, devise and bequeath as follows:</I>
<blockquote>
One-half my property to my sister Doris.<br>
One-half to my nephew Edward, son of my late brother William.
</blockquote>
<I>I give, devise and bequeath all the residue of my estate unto</I>
<P>
<I> I nominate and appoint </I>Reliable Trust Company <I>to be the executor and trustee of this my last will.</I>

(signed) 'Tessa Teapotte' Signature of Testator&quot;
</blockquote>
[The printed testimonium clause, providing space for the signatures and addresses of witnesses, was not filled in, and is not reproduced.]
<P>
Doris tells you that she has just learned that her nephew, Edward, died in an accident abroad, a few days before the death of Tessa. By a mishap, notification of Edward's death to his family was delayed, and was not received until after Tessa's death. Edward left a valid will leaving all of his estate to his wife, Frida, who is still living.
<P>
Doris also tells you that Tessa was wrong in believing that Doris' husband was rich, or that Doris would inherit a lot from him. Her husband has a pretty good income, but they tend to spend everything he earns. He has very little life insurance, and is now uninsurable for health reasons. Doris expects to be in much reduced financial circumstances if her husband predeceases her.
<P>
<B>Consider the following problems:
<P>
 [15 marks]  (a) Is the printed-form, &quot;stationer's&quot; will form, dated December 17, 1994, valid, in whole or in part, as a testamentary instrument under Ontario law?
<P>
[20 marks] (b) Regardless of your answer to part (a), suppose that the &quot;stationer's&quot; will form dated December 17, 1994 had been validly executed with witnesses, <I>but did not contain the express revocation clause.</I> How should the property of Tessa Teapotte be distributed?</b>
<P>
<b>Q2.</b>  Tilly died in November 1994. A clause of her valid will, made in early 1994, read as follows:
<blockquote>
&quot;I give, devise and bequeath the sum of $30,000 to be divided equally among the three daughters of my sister Irene.&quot;
</blockquote>
The residue of Tilly's estate was given to a charity.
<P>
In 1980, Tilly had quarrelled bitterly with Irene over a matter arising out of the distribution of their late father's estate. They stopped talking to each other, and in that year, Irene moved west to British Columbia. Tilly heard nothing more from her.
<P>
Irene subsequently married, and had three children during the period from her marriage until 1993. The children were a son, Evelyn, and two daughters, Jennifer and Gillian.
<P>
The only available evidence relating to Tilly's knowledge of Irene's family comes from a friend of Tilly's who still exchanged Christmas cards with Irene. While Tilly was visiting the friend, in December 1993, she saw a Christmas card from Irene, signed &quot;Irene, Fred, Evelyn, Jennifer and Gillian.&quot; Fred was the husband of Irene. According to the friend, Tilly had become rather sad and pensive after seeing the card, and had remarked that she had made a bad mistake cutting herself off from her sister and her sister's family, and &quot;she would try to rectify it in some way.
<P>
Some time in 1994, before Tilly's death, and unknown to Tilly, Irene's daughter Jennifer had died. Shortly after Jennifer's death, and before Tilly's death, Irene gave birth to twin daughters, Lillian and Mona. Evelyn, Gillian, Lillian and Mona all survived Tilly.
<P>
<B>[18 marks]  How should the fund of $30,000 be divided?</B>
<P>
 <b>Q3.</b> John had the benefit of a group life insurance policy, entered into between his employer and the insurer. The policy provided that, on the death of an employee in John's category, a death benefit of $100,000 would be paid to a beneficiary designated by the employee, or, if none, to the employee's estate. John had designated as beneficiary a trustee for an infant child from his first marriage. On his death, his second wife, Mary, is dissatisfied with the provisions made for her in his will.
<P>
<B>If Mary brings an application under Part V of the Succession Law Reform Act, would the death benefit of $100,000 payable under the policy be counted in calculating the value of John's estate, for the purposes of such an application, and be subject to a charging order, if the application is successful?</b>
<P>
<center><b>PART B</b></center>
<P>
<b>Q.4</b> You have been consulted by Billy Busy for some estate planning advice. Although you felt that your initial meeting with Mr. Busy was quite rushed you were able to ascertain the following information.
<p>
Mr. Busy is the sole sharholder of Busy Co., a large corporation which manufactures computer parts. His business is quite successful. The value of his shares has grown considerably over the years, and he is confident that the business will continue to grow in the future. Mr. Busy holds all common shares in Busy Co. and is paid regular dividends on the shares. In addition to being successful at the computer business, Mr. Busy has been very active in the real estate market, buying and selling property in the Toronto area on a regular basis. He currently owns 3 buildings in the Toronto area and 2 parcels of vacant land, as well as the home in which he lives with Ms. Brown. All of the real estate which Mr. Busy owns has increased in value since he acquired it. He does not really like the uncertainty of the stock market and has a very small portfolio consisting of holdings in only three public companies, two of which have performed well and increased in value and one of which has been a loser since the day he purchased it. He is reluctant to sell the &quot;loser&quot;, as he still has hopes that its value will turn around. The bulk of his other investments are in bonds and term deposits which both earn interest income only. In order to collect the interest income on the bonds, Mr. Busy must clip the coupons attached to the bonds and present them to his bank. He is generally too busy to do so. The interest income on the term deposits is automatically deposited every month to Mr. Busy's bank account.
<p>
Mr. Busy is not married but has been in a common law relationship with Mary Brown, an author, for many years. He and Ms. Brown have no children (he has been too busy!). One of the other reasons that Mr. Busy has no children is that he has a very strained relationship with Ms. Brown's children from her previous marriage. These children are now adults and Mr. Busy has never provided support to them. However, Mr. Busy is quite close to his niece and nephews, Charles, age 9, Ann, age 16, and Andrew, age 22, the children of his sister Liz. Ann has already started to help Mr. Busy in the business, working there in the summers and part time during the school year. She intends to attend University in a few years and study business and computers. Andrew, on the other hand is not as ambitious as his younger sister, although he is quite bright, and is still &quot;finding himself&quot; through travel and odd jobs. There has been some early indication that Charles may require some private tutoring to help him keep up with his studies.
<p>
Mr. Busy has taken a special interest in his niece and nephews because their mother, his sister Liz, has been very ill for a number of years and it now appears that she does not have long to live. It is Mr. Busy's understanding that his sister Liz has left a part of her estate to him in her will. Mr. Busy does not feel comfortable discussing this with his sister at this time but he tells you that he has no need for any part of her estate and does not want it.
<p>
Because Ms. Brown is an author, her income fluctuates from year to year There are periods when she has a steady flow of royalty income and there are periods in between when her income is quite low.
<P>
Mr. Busy has asked you for estate planning advice. He tells you that he has great confidence in your abilities and that he has no time to return to your office. He wants you to outline the relevant matters in a memo to him and he says that he will sign whatever you tell him to sign .
<P>
<B>Please consider the following:
<P>
 20 marks i) What estate planning steps could be taken by Mr. Busy during his lifetime?
<P>
 15 marks ii) What are some of the estate planning issues which should be addressed when considering Mr. Busy's will?</b>

<h1>Controlling Racial Discrimination in Policing: A Discussion Paper<a href="#note">*</a><br>
KEVIN DAVIS</h1>
<p>
<i>There is a widespread perception among racial minorities that the Canadian criminal justice system in general and the police in particular discriminate against racial minorities. This paper is about the role that the legal system has to play in regulating racial discrimination in policing. The author refers to the literature providing empirical evidence that the police discriminate against racial minorities when making decisions involving allocation of resources and whether to stop, search, arrest or use force against suspects. He also discusses how various legal mechanisms might be used to control each of these forms of discrimination. These mechanisms include: the police complaints process; disciplinary proceedings under police codes of conduct; the criminal law; human rights legislation; the Charter; and, coroner's inquests. The discussion suggests that further research is required on the problems of proof, remedies and standing involved in using the legal system to regulate racial discrimination in policing. 
<p>
L'opinon est r&eacute;pandue chez les minorit&eacute;s raciales selon laquelle le syst&egrave;me de justice criminelle et plus  particuli&egrave;rement la police font preuve de discrimination dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions. Cet article traite du r&ocirc;le que peut jouer le syst&egrave;me judiciaire pour restreindre la discrimination raciale dans le service policier. L'auteur fait r&eacute;f&eacute;rence &agrave; des &eacute;tudes empiriques qui d&eacute;montrent qu'il y a de la discrimination envers les minorit&eacute;s raciales dans la r&eacute;partition des ressources polici&egrave;res et dans les d&eacute;cisions de fouiller un suspect, de le fouiller, de l'arr&ecirc;ter ou d'avoir recours &agrave; la force contre lui. L'auteur consid&egrave;re &eacute;galement la possibilit&eacute; d'employer divers m&eacute;canismes juridiques pour contr&ocirc;ler ces formes de discrimination. Parmi ces m&eacute;canismes on compte les proc&eacute;dures de plainte contre la police; les recours fond&eacute;s sur les codes de conduite de la police, sur le droit criminel, sur les lois concernant les droits de la personne ou sur la Charte canadienne; et les enqu&ecirc;tes du coroner. Il ressort de la discussion qu'il faudra enqu&ecirc;ter davantage sur les difficult&eacute;s reli&eacute;es &agrave; la preuve, aux r&eacute;parations et &agrave; la qualit&eacute; pour agir que soul&egrave;ve le recours au syst&egrave;me judiciaire pour restreindre la discrimination raciale dans le service policier.</i>
<p>
There is a widespread perception among racial minorities that the Canadian criminal justice system in general and the police in particular discriminate against racial minorities. In a survey performed in Nova Scotia for the Royal Commission on the Prosecution of Donald Marshall Jr, about 60 percent of respondents agreed that police discriminated against blacks.<sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup> In a similar survey conducted in Montreal, 53 percent of respondents agreed that the police mistreat citizens from ethnic minorities.<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup> In Manitoba, Ontario, and Nova Scotia, aboriginal people have complained that they are singled out for enforcement action and stereotyped by the police.<sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup> Studies performed in the United States and Great Britain also suggest that blacks and hispanics are likely to have less favourable attitudes toward the police than whites.<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup>
<p>
 The fact that the criminal justice system is ostensibly committed to principles of fairness and impartiality, yet seems to do little to help those who have been or are likely to be discriminated against by the police, only serves to fuel the frustration of those individuals and groups. The riots that occurred in Los Angeles in the aftermath of the verdict in the Rodney King case demonstrate how loss of faith in the institutions that purport to protect the rights of individuals can ultimately lead to social unrest.
<p>
A complete analysis of racial discrimination in the criminal justice system would examine all stages of the criminal process, from initial contact with the police, through prosecution, sentencing, and parole.<sup><a href="#five">5</a></sup> This article, however, will only examine discrimination in police conduct. This narrow focus may be justified on a number of grounds. First, as the members of the criminal justice system most likely to come in contact with members of the community, the police are likely to play an important role in shaping citizens' perceptions of the system as a whole.<sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup> Second, although decisions that may appear to have a more significant impact on an individual are made at other stages in the criminal process, the police have a great deal of influence over an individual's subsequent involvement with other elements of the justice system.<sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup> Third, this 
article will be concerned with both the scope of the problem posed by discrimination in policing and the role that the law might play in addressing that problem. The focus on policing will permit an exploration of any legal responses that might be uniquely suited to controlling and structuring police decision making. 
<p>
The first section of this article defines what is meant by racial discrimination on the part of the police. The second section discusses the role that the legal system has to play in controlling police conduct. The third section provides an overview of the major bodies of law that regulate police conduct. Finally, the fourth section of the article introduces some of the empirical evidence that suggests that the police engage in selected forms of discriminatory conduct and discusses how the bodies of law identified in the third section might be used to control that conduct. Since very little has been written in this area of Canadian law, much of the discussion in the final section is highly speculative and is meant mainly to suggest directions for future research.
<p>
<h3>Identifying Discriminatory Conduct</h3>

A good working definition of discrimination has been adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in <cite>Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews</cite>, in which McIntyre J. (speaking for the Court on this issue) held that
<blockquote>
discrimination may be described as a distinction, whether intentional or not but based on grounds related to personal characteristics of the individual or group, which has the effect of imposing burdens, obligations, or disadvantages on such individual or group not imposed upon others, or which withholds or limits access to 
opportunities, benefits, and advantages available to other members of society.<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup>
</blockquote>
A great deal of attention has been devoted to the issue whether differential treatment of racial minorities represents the effects of racial discrimination, or discrimination on the basis of factors closely tied to race such as socioeconomic status. Yet, despite its possible importance from a sociological perspective, this issue may  be largely irrelevant from a legal perspective. From a legal perspective, according to <cite>Andrews</cite>, discrimination exists once it can be shown that an official act has the effect of resulting in differential treatment of a racial group, whether or not that differential treatment is best explained by race or by a factor strongly correlated with race.<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup>
<p>
<h3>Responses to the Problem: The Role of the Law</h3>

Police officers make a wide variety of decisions in the course of their duties and some of the most important of these are made in the course of enforcing the criminal law. Examples include decisions whether to arrest, search and detain suspects and whether to investigate citizens' complaints. Each of these types of decision 
may present opportunities for discrimination on racial grounds. Suspects or other individuals with whom the police interact (such as complainants) may be affected.
<p>
The legal system has an important role to play in responding to the problem of racial discrimination in policing. Legal mechanisms can be used to facilitate the punishment of officers who engage in racial discrimination, to help victims of police discrimination obtain redress, and to reduce the incidence of discriminatory conduct among police officers. It is important to note that the incidence of discriminatory conduct can be reduced both by punishing those who engage in such conduct and by addressing the systemic causes of discrimination in policing. Those systemic causes include the lack of racial diversity among police officers, the use of reactive as opposed to community-based policing, and the inadequacy of race relations training offered to police recruits.<sup><a href="#ten">10</a></sup> So far, relatively few legal mechanisms have been designed to address these causes.<sup><a href="#eleven">11</a></sup> A notable exception to this general rule is s. 48 of the <cite>Police Services Act</cite> which requires Ontario police forces to prepare employment equity plans.<sup><a href="#twelve">12</a></sup>
<p>
The systemic causes of racial discrimination on the part of the police also include those factors that allow discriminatory actions to be concealed as valid exercises of discretion. The most important of these factors in the context of policing is the granting of overly broad discretion to police officers. Whenever possible, the police, like other grantees of discretionary power, should be encouraged to limit or at least structure their discretion.<sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup> A second factor that serves to conceal discrimination is the failure to disclose details of potentially discriminatory policies and practices. As one commentator has stated: &quot;secret law, we should not have to be reminded ... has no place in any decent system of justice.&quot;<sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup> Thus, the details of any policies or practices with the potential to discriminate against particular racial groups should be open to scrutiny. Finally, it could be argued that failure to collect racial crime statistics also facilitates concealment of discrimination on the part of the police.<sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup>
<p>
There is some concern that it is inappropriate to rely upon legal institutions to control racial discrimination in policing because they lack the institutional competence to regulate police conduct. There is also a concern that the threat of external sanction will divert police attention and resources from the investigation of crime for little net benefit. These arguments have found some favour in the courts. The fact that most police decisions are characterized for legal purposes as involving the exercise of discretion indicates the courts' reluctance to review the merits of most police decisions. In <cite>Hill v. Chief Constable of West Yorkshire</cite>, Lord Templeman explicitly stated his preference that regulation of police conduct be performed by non-legal institutions:
<blockquote>
The question for determination in this appeal is whether an action for damages is an appropriate vehicle for investigating the efficiency of a police force ... . The efficiency of a police force can only be investigated by an inquiry instituted by the national or local authorities which are responsible to the electorate for that 
efficiency.<sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The argument that legal institutions lack the competence to regulate police conduct is based on a number of concerns. First, judicial review of police conduct is generally reactive rather than proactive. Second, the courts arguably do not have the knowledge of the necessities of real-life policing required to make appropriate decisions with regards to police conduct.<sup><a href="#seventeen">17</a></sup> Third, unlike the administrative or legislative processes, the judicial process is ill-suited to formulating policies to govern police conduct because of its limited ability to take into consideration all affected interests and to assess alternative policy measures. Fourth, the judicial process is ill-suited to ongoing supervision of the police or any other institution.<sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup> It is important to note, however, that while these concerns generally apply to the courts, they do not necessarily apply to administrative bodies such as the Police Complaints Commissioner and the Human Rights Commission.
<p>
The reluctance to rely on legal mechanisms to control police conduct is also based in part on the fact that there are alternative methods of regulating police activity. Police officers are ultimately accountable in the political sphere as a result of their accountability to bodies such as the federal and provincial solicitors general. In some areas, members of municipal police forces are also accountable to police boards or commissions. If there is sufficient public pressure, as Lord Templeman noted, various aspects of police conduct can be reviewed by special commissions, inquiries, and task forces. Many of these bodies have specifically addressed problems associated with racial discrimination in policing.<sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a></sup> The political accountability of the police to the communities they serve may also be facilitated by bodies such as public monitoring groups.<sup><a href="#twenty">20</a></sup>
<p>
However, the potential weaknesses of political mechanisms for ensuring police accountability for discrimination against racial minorities should be recognized.<sup><a href="#twenty1">21</a></sup> Minority groups, by their very nature, may tend to find it difficult to use the formal political process to express concerns about discriminatory police conduct. Recent experience suggests that minority groups are capable of bringing enough political pressure to bear to cause the creation of special inquiries.<sup><a href="#twenty2">22</a></sup> They have also had some success in organizing public monitoring groups. However, the overall effectiveness of these kinds of political activity is questionable. Like the courts, special
inquiries are reactive and, unlike the courts, their mandate is subject to political control. They are also extremely expensive and their recommendations often take years to implement. Police monitoring groups appear to be prone to being either co-opted by the police or marginalized when they persist in  onfrontational tactics.<sup><a href="#twenty3">23</a></sup>
<p>
The advantages of having legal mechanisms play a role in regulating police conduct should not be overlooked. First, the courts are conveniently situated to evaluate police conduct when the consequence of that conduct is a criminal prosecution. Second, despite the arguments to the contrary, it is reasonable to assume that the courts possess considerable expertise in assessing when police conduct violates individuals' legal rights since judicially created guidelines provide the framework within which most police conduct towards suspects takes place. Over time, bodies such as human rights commissions and police complaints commissioners may develop similar expertise. Finally, there is the argument of sheer necessity. The law is often the last resort for individuals whose rights have been violated by the state. All of these reasons support
Lamer J.'s characterization of the judiciary as &quot;guardian of the justice system.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty4">24</a></sup>
<p>
<h3>Overview of Legal Mechanisms for Controlling Police Conduct</h3>

Police conduct is subject to legal and quasi-legal constraints embodied in: complaints processes; police codes of conduct; criminal law; human rights legislation; the <cite>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</cite>;<sup><a href="#twenty5">25</a></sup> and coroners' inquests. 
<p>
1. THE COMPLAINTS PROCESS
<p>
In Ontario, the <cite>Police Services Act</cite> provides for civilian review of complaints made against the police.<sup><a href="#twenty6">26</a></sup> A basic premise of the system is that &quot;the police force has the responsibility for performing initial investigation into complaints by members of the public.&quot;<sup><a href="#twenty7">27</a></sup> However, an independent agency, the Office of the Public Complaints Commissioner, monitors the investigation of the complaint and may take over an investigation (1) on request of the Chief of Police, (2) when the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that there has been undue delay or other exceptional circumstances in the conduct of the investigation, (3) any time 30 days or more after the complaint has been filed, (4) the complainant has commenced judicial proceedings relating to the complaint, or (5) the complaint concerns more than one police force.<sup><a href="#twenty8">28</a></sup>
<p>
After investigating a complaint, the Police Chief may decide among the following: that no further action is necessary, to admonish the officer, to order disciplinary proceedings to be held, to order a hearing of all or part of the complaint by a board of inquiry, or to cause an information to be laid against the police officer.<sup><a href="#twenty9">29</a></sup> The Commissioner may review  the decision of the Police Chief either at his own initiative or at the request of the complainant and may order a hearing by a board of
inquiry. The Commissioner may also review a decision made in a disciplinary hearing at the request of the complainant.<sup><a href="#thirty">30</a></sup> Informal resolutions of complaints may occur at any
stage in the complaint process.<sup><a href="#thirty1">31</a></sup>
<p>
The complaints process created by the <cite>Police Services Act</cite> serves to systematize the collection of information regarding police misconduct and provides a mechanism for punishing police officers who engage in misconduct. The Commissioner is also specifically empowered to make recommendations regarding police practices.<sup><a href="#thirty2">32</a></sup> However, the complaints process does not provide an exhaustive set of remedies for complainants. For example, neither boards of inquiry nor boards constituted to hear disciplinary proceedings may order either the officer or the police force to compensate a complainant who has suffered harm as a result of police misconduct. 
<p>
2. POLICE CODES OF CONDUCT
<p>
Racially motivated police conduct may infringe a number of provisions of police codes of conduct. It is also possible for such conduct to be made the subject matter of a specific offence. For example, the Bellemare Commission recommended that acts in violation of the rights and freedoms guaranteed in the <cite>Charter</cite> be considered an act of derogation in violation of the Code of Police Ethics.<sup><a href="#thirty3">33</a></sup> The Ontario <cite>Police Services Act</cite> states that discreditable conduct, which is an offence under the Police Code of Conduct, includes racial discrimination and that the use of racially abusive or insulting language is a form of discreditable conduct.<sup><a href="#thirty4">34</a></sup> Penalties for disciplinary offences are generally limited to forfeiture of wages and dismissal.<sup><a href="#thirty5">35</a></sup>
<p>
3. CRIMINAL LAW
<p>
Although discrimination <i>per se</i> is not a <cite>Criminal Code</cite> offence, discriminatory conduct on the part of the police may constitute a <cite>Criminal Code</cite> offence. This is most likely in the case of conduct involving the use of excessive force. The situation is complicated somewhat by the fact that police officers enjoy a qualified immunity from criminal liability. Section 25 of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> protects police officers from criminal liability as long as they are doing what they are authorized to do and use as much force as is necessary for that purpose. Furthermore, the &quot;fleeing felon&quot; rule codified in s. 25(4) of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> permits a peace officer to use as much force as is necessary to prevent someone who is being arrested (with or without a warrant) from escaping by flight, &quot;unless the escape can be prevented by reasonable means in a less violent manner.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty6">36</a></sup>
<p>
Police officers are criminally responsible for use of force in excess of that which they are authorized to use by the above provisions. The nature of an officer's liability depends on the nature and quality of the excessive force. Officers engaged in excessive use of force are often charged with: assault, careless use of a firearm (s. 86), criminal negligence (s. 219), criminal negligence causing bodily harm (s. 221), manslaughter, or murder
(s. 229). Other possible charges include uttering threats (s. 264) and official torture (s. 269.1).
<p>
4. HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION
<p>
Most human rights legislation provides that &quot;every person has a right to equal treatment with respect to services.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty7">37</a></sup> There now seems to be little question that police officers carrying out their duties are engaged in the provision of a service so as to be subject to these provisions.<sup><a href="#thirty8">38</a></sup> Consequently, members of municipal and provincial police forces are subject to the prohibitions against discrimination contained in provincial human rights legislation; the R.C.M.P. is subject to the <cite>Canadian Human Rights Act</cite>.
<p>
Most human rights legislation provides victims of discrimination with a broad range of remedies. In Ontario, for example, the Human Rights Commission generally tends to encourage a settlement between the parties concerned. If, however, the Commission decides to  request the Minister to appoint a board of inquiry, the board has sweeping powers to remedy any discrimination that it finds. Under s. 40(1)(a) of the Ontario legislation the board may &quot;direct a party to do anything that, in the opinion of the board, the party ought to do to achieve compliance with this Act, both in respect of the complaint and future practices.&quot;  Section 40(1)(b) of the Ontario legislation grants the board the power to award restitution,
including monetary compensation.
<p>
Very few cases involving police officers have been heard by either the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal or boards of inquiry created under provincial human rights legislation. The reasons for this are unclear but may include the low visibility of the legislation relative to procedures for registering complaints against police officers. It should also be noted that some commissions have the discretion to decide not to deal with a complaint if it is one that could or should be more appropriately dealt with under another Act.<sup><a href="#thirty9">39</a></sup>
<p> 
5. THE CHARTER OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS
<p>
Police conduct involving racial discrimination may violate a number of the rights guaranteed by the <cite>Charter</cite>. First, such conduct is likely to violate the equality rights as provided in s. 15. Second, such conduct may violate the right not to be deprived of life, liberty, and security of the person except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice provided in s. 7 of the <cite>Charter</cite>. Finally, depending on the circumstances, discriminatory conduct on the part of the police may also violate an individual's rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure and not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as provided by ss. 8 and 9 of the <cite>Charter</cite>.
<p>
The remedies for violations of <cite>Charter</cite> rights are described in ss. 52 and 24 of the <cite>Charter</cite>. Section 52(1) renders any law inconsistent with the <cite>Charter</cite> of no force or effect. Section 24(1) allows those whose rights or freedoms have been infringed to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain &quot;such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances.&quot;  Section 24(2) permits the exclusion of evidence obtained in violation of <cite>Charter</cite> rights from subsequent proceedings.
<p>
The application of the <cite>Charter</cite> to novel claims is usually assisted by reference to the American jurisprudence on point. However, there is little American jurisprudence that explicitly addresses the constitutionality of racially discriminatory police conduct. The main reasons for this are that (1) the conventional interpretation of the equal protection clause is that it does not offer a remedy of a reversal of conviction and (2) private remedies under civil rights legislation have been severely restrained. Claims of misconduct are generally heard under the Fourth Amendment (the due process clause) and the resulting case law has been &quot;remarkably silent on the racial dimension of encounters between citizens and the 
police.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty">40</a></sup>
<p>
6. COMMON LAW
<p>
Individual police officers may be sued in tort for their actions. Vicarious liability may also be imposed on the police force. In <cite>Board of Governors of Seneca College of Applied Arts and Technology v. Bhaduria</cite>,<sup><a href="#forty1">41</a></sup> the Supreme Court of Canada refused to authorize the creation of a tort of discrimination. Despite the ruling in <cite>Bhaduria</cite>, however, it appears that, in principle at least, discriminatory conduct on the part of the police may give rise to a cause of action in negligence against senior police officials for failing to control that conduct. 
<p>
The groundwork for a cause of action involving allegations of discrimination on the part of police officers against suspects was laid in <cite>Johnson v. Adamson</cite>.<sup><a href="#forty2">42</a></sup> In <cite>Johnson v. Adamson</cite>, the Ontario Court of Appeal held that allegations that the Chief of Police and the Board of Commissioners were negligent in failing to control racism and racial harassment by members of 14 Division raised a triable issue. The Court was not prepared to find that under the circumstances no duty of care could have been owed by the officials to the plaintiffs, who were the widow, children, and estate of a black man who had been shot by the police. 
<p>
It also appears to be possible for people who come into contact with the police as complainants rather than as suspects to sue senior police officials in tort for causing or permitting discrimination against them. In <cite>Jane Doe v. Board of Commissioners of Police for Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto</cite>,<sup><a href="#forty3">43</a></sup> a woman brought an action in negligence against the Board of Commissioners of Police after being sexually assaulted by a serial rapist. The plaintiff alleged that the police were negligent in failing to warn her of the danger that she might be attacked or, in the absence of a warning, failing to apprehend the offender before she was assaulted. The Court held that a duty of care could be owed by the Board of Commissioners to victims of crime as long as the harm was foreseeable and a special relationship of proximity existed. In the Divisional Court, it was explicitly held that failure to act could give rise to a breach of the duty owed to the complainant.<sup><a href="#forty4">44</a></sup>
<p>
In the <cite>Jane Doe</cite> case, the alleged negligence was also claimed to have violated the plaintiff's rights under ss. 7 and 15(1) of the <cite>Charter</cite>. If the case ever comes to trial, it will be interesting to discover whether constitutionally entrenched principles of anti-discrimination inform the interpretation of the relevant standard of care. For instance, given the existence of those principles, the court might be willing to find that acting on the basis of stereotypical beliefs would in itself constitute negligence. If <cite>Jane Doe</cite> or a similar case comes to trial and is decided in favour of the plaintiff, it will be interesting to see whether the courts will award equitable relief directed at changing police practices, or whether they will restrict themselves to awarding monetary damages.
<p>
7. CORONER'S INQUESTS
<p>
Police conduct that results in the death of a member of the public may become the subject of a coroner's inquest. In Ontario, a coroner must consider holding an inquest whenever a person dies as a result of violence, negligence, or misconduct.<sup><a href="#forty5">45</a></sup> An inquest is mandatory whenever a person dies while being detained by or in the custody of a peace officer.<sup><a href="#forty6">46</a></sup> Usually, however, any inquest must wait until after the final disposition of
any charges under the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> arising from the death.<sup><a href="#forty7">47</a></sup>
<p>
The scope of a coroner's inquest is potentially quite broad.<sup><a href="#forty8">48</a></sup> Traditionally, the primary purpose of an inquest was an investigative one---namely, to determine how the deceased came to his or her death. Recently, though, there has been increasing recognition that coroner's inquests also serve important social and preventive functions.<sup><a href="#forty9">49</a></sup> This trend towards the recognition of the social and preventive functions of coroner's inquests has also involved a greater willingness on the part of the courts to permit coroners to grant standing at inquests to public interest interveners.<sup><a href="#fifty">50</a></sup> Given this trend in the case law, it seems reasonable to expect that a coroner's inquest could be used to explore the extent to which racial factors played a role in causing the death of an individual at the hands of the police. It is important to remember, however, that control over the issues to be explored at an inquest lies largely in the hands of the coroner.<sup><a href="#fifty1">51</a></sup> There is no guarantee that a coroner will decide to explore racial aspects of the circumstances surrounding a death.<sup><a href="#fifty2">52</a></sup>
<p>
A coroner's jury is empowered only to make recommendations. Nevertheless, inquests play an important political role by helping to allay community concerns about the circumstances surrounding suspicious deaths and providing the public with information about police practices.<sup><a href="#fifty3">53</a></sup>
<p>
<h3>Application: Legal Regulation of Police Discrimination</h3>

The empirical evidence of racial discrimination on the part of the police in the making of decisions involving the allocation of resources and whether to stop, search, arrest, and use force against suspects is discussed below. The ways in which any or all of the legal mechanisms discussed above may be used to control any
discrimination revealed in the making of these decisions are also discussed. The <cite>Jane Doe</cite> case demonstrates how discrimination in another type of decision made by the police---namely, whether to warn potential victims of their danger---may have a significant impact on affected individuals. Other important decisions that are not discussed in this article include decisions whether to lay charges and detain suspects for bail hearings.
<p>
1. ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES
<p>
There are two main ways in which the allocation of resources chosen by police administrators may involve discrimination against racial minorities. First, the police might discriminate against minority suspects by allocating more resources to investigate crimes committed by members of racial minorities. The police might
do this by choosing to expend more effort in investigating either offences that are disproportionately committed by racial minorities or offences that are committed in areas in which there is a higher proportion of racial minorities.
<p>
The police might also discriminate against racial minorities who are victims of crime by failing to allocate adequate resources to the investigation of their complaints. The same effect might be achieved indirectly by failing to allocate sufficient resources to the investigation of crimes more likely to harm racial minorities. The 
unfortunate consequence of the interaction of discrimination against both suspects and complainants is that certain communities may legitimately complain about being simultaneously underpoliced and overpoliced. 
<p>
<i>Discrimination Against Suspects</i><br>
With respect to the issue whether the police expend more effort in investigating crimes that are committed disproportionately by racial minorities, in North America racial minorities are disproportionately involved in street crime and there is little doubt that more resources are expended to fight street crime than white collar crime. There is also some evidence that racial differences in criminality are minimal when white-collar crimes are taken into account.<sup><a href="#fifty4">54</a></sup> It can be argued, however, that the political decision to focus on street crime is more reflective of class bias than any racial bias and, furthermore, that this class bias is shared by most members of society.<sup><a href="#fifty5">55</a></sup>
<p>
As for the issue whether the police discriminate in their allocation of resources to areas that have a high proportion of racial minorities, several studies have found that patterns of police activity are strongly influenced by their conceptions of a given neighbourhood.<sup><a href="#fifty6">56</a></sup> These studies suggest that the police are more likely to engage in an aggressive and stereotyped pattern of police
work in areas that they consider to be &quot;offensible space&quot;---that is, areas in which the police perceive a disproportionate incidence of deviant behaviour. Some of these studies have found that the
&quot;ecological contamination&quot; associated with police conceptions of offensible space accounts for overpolicing (relative to evidence of actual rates of offending derived from self-report surveys) of youths
and adults in stigmatized areas. This form of police conduct has a disparate impact on members of racial minorities to the extent that they are likely to be overrepresented in stigmatized areas.<sup><a href="#fifty7">57</a></sup>
<p>
To be successful, any action alleging racial discrimination against suspects in a police force's allocation of 
resources would probably have to overcome the argument that crime rates in certain areas justify the effort expended in policing those areas. However, this argument should not play a role in determining whether discrimination has taken place. According to <cite>Andrews</cite>, discrimination exists once it can be shown that state action  has a differenctial impact on a particular group. In <cite>Andrews</cite>, McIntyre J. stated that &quot;[w]here discrimination is found, a breach of s. 15(1) has occurred and - where s. 15(2) is not applicable - any consideration of the reasonableness of the enactment, indeed any consideration of factors which could justify the discrimination and support the constitutionality of the impugned enactment would take place under s. 1.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty8">58</a></sup> Thus, the police's reasons for discriminating will be relevant only in the s. 1 analysis. This will have the important consequence of placing the onus on the state to explain its actions. This means that explanations based on irrational factors such as ecological contamination and faulty crime statistics can be exposed and criticized.
<p>
Claims of racial discrimination in the allocation of resources by the police may also involve difficult issues of standing and remedies. For instance, could any member of a racial group bring such a claim, or could only individuals who have been the subject of police action?  If the latter is the case, these issues will usually be raised by individuals who have subsequently been accused of wrongdoing. If successful, will they be able to obtain a stay of proceedings, exclusion of evidence, or dismissal of charges against them?  Will the courts be willing to award a group remedy such as an order requiring the police to change their allocation of resources? If so, how far are the courts willing to go in determining a non-discriminatory allocation of police resources?  The answers to these questions may vary depending on the type of claim being brought and cannot be resolved within the scope of this article.
<p>
<i>Discrimination Against Complainants</i><br>
As for discrimination against complainants, one American study found that the race of the complainant was an important determinant of decision making on the part of the police and other actors within the criminal justice system.<sup><a href="#fifty9">59</a></sup> In that study, in police encounters involving both suspects and complainants, the race of the victim was found to be a statistically significant determinant of police decision making, while the race of the suspect was not.<sup><a href="#sixty">60</a></sup> It is important to note that this study focused on decisions made by individual police officers. There has been little analysis of the extent to which those decisions reflect decisions made by senior police officials.
<p>
Less empirical data on discrimination against complainants are available in Canada. A study commissioned by the Royal Commission on the Donald Marshall Jr Prosecution found indications that police stereotype aboriginal people as being drunk and violent but then discount the importance of calls from reserves. This phenomenon was attributed to a perception that any violence was not serious enough to be of any real danger to individuals, and as long as it was kept within the reserve community, the violence is not as important as violence off the reserve.<sup><a href="#sixty1">61</a></sup> As in the United States, there has been no analysis of whether decisions made by senior police officials, as opposed to street-level decisions made by individual officers, discriminate against complainants.
<p>
<cite>Jane Doe</cite> and <cite>Johnson v. Adamson</cite> have established important precedents in deciding that, in principle, police may be liable either in negligence or under the <cite>Charter</cite> for failing to provide a certain level of services to members of an identifiable group. What remains to be seen is whether complainants can discharge the burden of proving such claims and the nature of the remedies the courts will be prepared to offer.
<p>
2. DECISIONS TO STOP, SEARCH, AND ARREST
<p>
The majority of the empirical research on racial discrimination by police officers has focused on the street-level decisions made by individual officers. The decisions that are most commonly studied are decisions to stop, search, and arrest suspects.
<p>
There have been many complaints that members of minority racial groups are more likely to be searched, detained or subjected to some other form of &quot;proactive policing&quot; than members of the majority
group. There is American evidence that police stop and search young, low-income, ethnic minority males more frequently than any other group.<sup><a href="#sixty2">62</a></sup> British studies have also concluded that blacks are stopped disproportionately.<sup><a href="#sixty3">63</a></sup>
<p>
Ericson suggests that the police tend to use constant proactive stops as &quot;a not-so-subtle way of reminding marginal people of the `order of things.'&quot;<sup><a href="#sixty4">64</a></sup> In the jurisdiction studied by Ericson, the targeted population of marginals was not defined by race; instead, it was a group of lower-class young persons &quot;who may be involved occasionally in drug and property-related offenses and who appear to some as offensive.&quot;  He noted, however, that in some jurisdictions the 
targeted population was dominated by members of certain racial groups: 
<blockquote>
In the urban core of Philadelphia as studied by Rubenstein (1973), the target is lower-class individuals (many of whom are black) who engage in marginal vice activities (pimps, prostitutes, bootleggers, numbers dealers). In the rural prairie region of Canada, the target is lower-class people (many of whom are native 
Indians) who use and abuse liquor and other drugs.<sup><a href="#sixty5">65</a></sup>
</blockquote>
A number of studies have also specifically examined the decision whether to arrest a suspect. Two types of studies have been performed in attempts to determine whether police discriminate against minorities in deciding whom to arrest. First, arrest statistics have been compared with estimates of &quot;actual&quot; rates of offending based on self-report (in which subjects are asked to disclose their own previous criminal activity) and crime victimization (in which victims of crime identify the race of the offender) surveys. Second, the characteristics of police-suspect encounters have been analyzed.
<p>
Self-report surveys have revealed &quot;slight or non-existent&quot; racial differences in offending, thus supporting the hypothesis that the police discriminate against minorities in deciding whom to arrest. The usefulness of these surveys is limited, however, since they have only been performed on juveniles, and generally have focused on involvement in minor incidents.<sup><a href="#sixty6">66</a></sup> Information provided on self-report surveys has also been found to be differentially valid in that there was a tendency for black males to underreport their involvement in offences.<sup><a href="#sixty7">67</a></sup> In contrast, the proportion of blacks identified as offenders in victimization surveys has generally been consistent with official arrest statistics.<sup><a href="#sixty8">68</a></sup>
<p>
Studies of decision making in police-suspect encounters have yielded more complex results. One of the few empirical studies of police decision making in Canada happened to collect evidence on decisions to issue summons for traffic enforcement, an area in which the police have considerable discretionary latitude. The officers claimed that the &quot;attitude&quot; of the violator was the prime factor in deciding whether to give a traffic summons. Interestingly, however, it was found that, in addition to demeanour, the race of suspects was a statistically significant determinant of the decision to issue a summons.<sup><a href="#sixty9">69</a></sup>
<p>
However, American studies of police decision making have generally concluded that race is not a significant determinant of police decision to arrest a suspect once controls are introduced for factors such as suspects' demeanour, neighbourhood poverty level, seriousness of the offence, and whether the complainant demanded an arrest.<sup><a href="#seventy">70</a></sup> Several studies have found that suspects' demeanour is one of the most important determinants of whether police arrest a suspect.<sup><a href="#seventy1">71</a></sup> One study found that police officers' greater willingness to arrest people in poor neighbourhoods, regardless of their race, resulted in higher arrest rates for blacks because of the racial composition of poor neighbourhoods.<sup><a href="#seventy2">72</a></sup>
<p>
The questionable relevance (for legal purposes) of whether conduct that has a disparate impact is based on race or other factors was discussed in the first section of this article. It was noted there that this distinction is particularly unimportant when it can be shown that distinctions have been made on the basis of factors
closely linked to race or ethnicity, where those factors are not in themselves legally significant. Factors such as neighbourhood poverty levels are closely correlated with race in many jurisdictions. However, there has also been some recognition in the sociological literature that facially neutral factors such as demeanour may not be race-neutral, and that in fact objectively neutral responses to a suspect's demeanour might operate to the detriment of members of minority groups in their encounters with the police.<sup><a href="#seventy3">73</a></sup>
<p>
In theory, police codes of conduct, human rights legislation, the <cite>Charter</cite>, and the common law should all apply to discrimination revealed in police officers' decisions to stop, search, and arrest suspects. There are, however, two main problems associated with controlling discrimination revealed in police officers' street-level decisions. The first is that the courts may find that the police action in question does not impose a sufficient burden on an individual to impinge on legal rights. <i>De minimis</i> intrusions on individual rights such as brief investigatory stops (of pedestrians) are not considered worthy of constitutional protection.<sup><a href="#seventy4">74</a></sup> The legitimacy of the judicially defined threshold that excludes the victims of investigatory stops from constitutional protection can be questioned.<sup><a href="#seventy5">75</a></sup> It should also be recognized, however, that because of the unique quality of the harm caused by discriminatory treatment of any kind, otherwise <i>de minimis</i> intrusions become particularly deserving of judicial oversight if they are based on racial considerations.<sup><a href="#seventy6">76</a></sup>
<p>
The second problem with using legal techniques to control street-level discrimination on the part of police officers is the evidentiary difficulty of proving that it has taken place. For example, it is extremely difficult for a complainant to demonstrate that he or she has been discriminated against by the police in being
subjected to a street stop. Admissions of discriminatory motivation such as racist epithets would be useful in this respect but usually are not present.<sup><a href="#seventy7">77</a></sup> Even when evidence of such statements is introduced by a complainant, the evidence is unlikely to be accepted. In the usual case, the only witnesses to the incident are other police officers. If it comes down to the word of a police officer versus that of a complainant, the trier of fact is generally more likely to prefer the police officer's version of
events.<sup><a href="#seventy8">78</a></sup>
<p>
A possible solution to these problems of proof is to use data from empirical studies such as those cited above. Even if the data are not sufficient to prove that a particular officer has discriminated against a particular individual, the individual may be able to obtain a remedy based only on his or her membership in the group that has been discriminated against. The only limitation on the effectiveness of the use of such statistics may be their methodological integrity. For example, if empirical studies fail to explore whether disparate impacts can be explained by &quot;legally relevant&quot; factors, they can do little to rebut the justifications that will inevitably be offered for <i>prima facie</i> discriminatory conduct.<sup><a href="#seventy9">79</a></sup>
<p>
Another means of solving problems of proving discrimination is to challenge systemic factors that make it difficult to uncover instances of discrimination. For instance, the difficulty of proving discrimination is increased when individual officers are granted a broad discretion to stop citizens. In theory, s. 9 of the <cite>Charter</cite> could be used to encourage police to structure their discretion so as to avoid creating opportunities for abuse, including discrimination against individuals based on racial factors (for example, the police might be required to have a reasonable suspicion that a person is involved in illegal activity before detaining him or her). Once the police are forced to structure their discretion, the burden will fall on officers whose decisions are inconsistent with the way that discretion has been structured to justify their behaviour. The individual is spared the difficulty of proving that his or her detention was based on racial considerations.<sup><a href="#eighty">80</a></sup> However, the Supreme Court of Canada has not yet shown any inclination to use s. 9 in this fashion.<sup><a href="#eighty1">81</a></sup>
<p>
So far, most of the jurisprudence regarding s. 9 has been concerned with motor vehicle stops. In <cite>R. v. Ladouceur</cite>,<sup><a href="#eighty2">82</a></sup> the Supreme Court of Canada held that a provision of the <cite>Highway Traffic Act</cite> that permitted police officers to stop vehicles at random and without &quot;articulable cause&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty3">83</a></sup> violated the right
not to be arbitrarily detained because the selection of drivers to be stopped was &quot;in the sole discretion of the police officer.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty4">84</a></sup> However, the majority of the Court held that the provision constituted a reasonable limit on the right not to be arbitrarily detained and so was upheld under s. 1 of the <cite>Charter</cite>.<sup><a href="#eighty5">85</a></sup> In contrast, in the United States, the reluctance to sanction the exercise of &quot;standardless and unconstrained discretion&quot; was the motivating factor in the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to strike down provisions authorizing random vehicle stops.<sup><a href="#eighty6">86</a></sup>
<p>
In <cite>Ladouceur</cite>, Tarnopolsky J.A., writing for the majority in the Ontario Court of Appeal<sup><a href="#eighty7">87</a></sup> and Sopinka J., in his dissenting judgement in the Supreme
Court of Canada,<sup><a href="#eighty8">88</a></sup> noted that one of the problems with granting police officers untrammelled discretion to determine which vehicles to stop is that some officers might
exercise that discretion based on racial considerations. Since the officers would not be required to provide any cause for stopping the vehicle, there would be no way of detecting such violations of detainees' constitutional rights. Both the majority in the Court of Appeal and the dissent in the Supreme Court would have read down the provision to require police officers to show articulable cause for stopping a vehicle. Vehicles stopped at an organized checkpoint would qualify.
<p>
Requiring officers to show objectively reasonable grounds for their actions obviously would not allow all, or nearly all, discriminatory conduct to be identified. Given their virtual monopoly over the information surrounding investigatory stops, officers will not often find it difficult to present a version of events that appears reasonable to a trier of fact.<sup><a href="#eighty9">89</a></sup> This argument is demonstrated by the fact that, in both the United States and Canada, officers are generally required to show reasonable and probable cause for arresting a suspect, yet the studies discussed above reveal discrimination in decisions to arrest suspects.
<p>
If, however, officers are required to provide reasonable grounds for their actions, it may at least be possible to expose decisions that are based on stereotypical racist assumptions rather than objectively reasonable and probable grounds. In the United States, a number of cases have involved police officers who, essentially,
attempted to use race as a probable cause factor by detaining people who &quot;don't belong&quot; in a particular neighbourhood, or who fit predetermined profiles, or for the purposes of identification when
there was little or no other evidence supporting detention.<sup><a href="#ninety">90</a></sup> The only Canadian case discussing the extent to which race can provide reasonable grounds for police action is <cite>Hum v. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police</cite>,<sup><a href="#ninety1">91</a></sup> which involved a challenge to the use of race as a probable cause factor in searches for illegal aliens.
<p>
Mr. Hum, a person of Chinese-Canadian ancestry, was stopped for speeding by an R.C.M.P. Constable. The Constable asked Mr. Hum to produce his driver's licence and vehicle registration. He then asked whether he was a Canadian citizen and where he was born. During the hearing, the Constable revealed that it was his practice to ask members of visible ethnic minorities these questions in an effort to detect illegal aliens. Although the Constable's practice of using these questions to enforce the <cite>Immigration Act</cite> was not exactly official policy, it was apparently common practice within the R.C.M.P. In fact, that practice was strongly defended by the Constable's superior officers, including senior officers of the Force, as an important investigatory technique.
<p> 
The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal held that the Constable had legal authority to question Mr. Hum only if he had reasonable and probable grounds for suspecting that he had committed a criminal offence or violated another federal statute (such as the <cite>Immigration Act</cite>). The Tribunal went on to find, however, that the Constable had no reasonable or probable grounds for suspecting that Mr. Hum was in breach of the <cite>Immigration Act</cite> and so had no legal authority to ask Mr. Hum questions regarding his citizenship. The Tribunal found that the only explanation for the Constable's actions was that he concluded that Mr. Hum's membership in a visible minority was an adequate basis for questioning him further. Consequently, the Tribunal found that Mr. Hum was the subject of adverse differentiation under s. 5(b) of the <cite>Canadian Human Rights Act</cite>. 
<p>
The Tribunal ordered the R.C.M.P. to &quot;cease the practice of questioning visible minorities as to their citizenship and place of birth in investigations under the <cite>Immigration Act</cite>, whether out of curiosity or a desire to confirm a bare suspicion, solely on the ground of race, colour or ethnic origin.&quot;  It also recommended that the R.C.M.P. provide instructions to its recruits and members regarding inappropriate methods of investigating infringements of the <cite>Immigration Act</cite>.
<p>
It is clear that where, as in <cite>Hum</cite>, race is not probative of a legally significant fact---for example, the likelihood that a suspect has committed an offence---it cannot provide reasonable grounds for action on the part of the police. A thornier issue is whether race can be used as a factor in police decision making when it is probative of a relevant fact. For instance, is a profile of illegal aliens that is based in whole or in part on racial considerations, but that happens to be &quot;accurate,&quot; legally valid? In the United States, the extent to which race can provide reasonable and probable grounds has been debated in the subtext of many of the decisions under the Fourth Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court has twice approved the use of race as a factor in detention decisions by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.<sup><a href="#ninety2">92</a></sup>
<p>
First of all, given the implications of such a determination, the courts should require clear and convincing proof before finding that race can be probative of wrongdoing. American courts have been criticized for being too willing to defer to police officers' &quot;expertise&quot; in determining that certain individuals or groups of individuals are suspicious.<sup><a href="#ninety3">93</a></sup> Judges should be wary of selection biases on the part of officers gathering data.<sup><a href="#ninety4">94</a></sup> They should also be sensitive to the fact that the importance of racial factors may be overestimated by police officers who have already used other factors to support their decision to stop an individual. 
<p>
Even assuming that clear and convincing proof is offered that race is probative of wrongdoing, it seems that the practice of using race as a factor in the decision to detain an individual could still be considered to be discriminatory since it would impose a burden on members of a particular racial group that is not imposed on members of other racial groups. Individuals who are subjected to such practices could argue that they are being deprived of their rights under either ss. 7 or 15 of the <cite>Charter</cite>. The issue would then
become whether such a violation could be upheld under s. 1 of the <cite>Charter</cite>. 
<p>
3. USE OF FORCE
<p>
Very little empirical research of a quantitative nature has been conducted in Canada on the use of excessive force against racial minorities by the police. However, the perception that the police are more likely to use deadly force against black youths than other persons is widely held among activists in the black community in Toronto and Montreal.<sup><a href="#ninety5">95</a></sup> A number of well-publicized shootings of
black people provided the impetus for the creation of some of the special inquiries into race relations and policing in those cities.<sup><a href="#ninety6">96</a></sup>
<p>
In the United States, about 60 percent of those killed by the police are black, although blacks comprise only 12 percent of the general population. It is unclear, however, whether this figure simply reflects blacks' greater likelihood of being involved in violent crime (which, in turn, suggests a greater likelihood that they will be involved in violent confrontations with the police). Some studies have found no unexplained racial gap once racial differences in offending or the nature of the danger faced by the police officer are taken into account.<sup><a href="#ninety7">97</a></sup> However, a well-cited study of police shootings in Memphis between 1969 and 1976 found that even when different rates of offending were controlled for, blacks were 2.5 times more likely than whites to be shot at by the police in situations in which the officers had elected to shoot or not to shoot at little or no risk to themselves or others.<sup><a href="#ninety8">98</a></sup> It should be noted that there is little empirical data on racial differentials in the use of excessive force short of deadly force by the police in either the United States or Canada. One of the few studies available is based on an analysis of only 37 incidents (it suggests that black police officers are more likely than white officers to use excessive force and that blacks are less likely than whites to be victims of police brutality).<sup><a href="#ninety9">99</a></sup> 
<p>
It appears that patterns of excessive use of deadly force are greatly influenced by characteristics peculiar to police organizations such as shooting guidelines and the personal philosophies of senior administrators. For example, the author of the study of shootings in Memphis found no unexplained racial gap in shootings in New York City.<sup><a href="#onehundred">100</a></sup> That author concluded that the phenomenon of police having one trigger finger for whites and another for blacks was highly place-dependent and correlated with the restrictiveness of the police force's internal shooting policies.<sup><a href="#one01">101</a></sup>
<p>
The Task Force on Race Relations and Policing reported that &quot;fundamental problems regarding the discretionary use of force reside in the law itself.&quot;<sup><a href="#one02">102</a></sup> The
main problem is the breadth of the discretion that police officers enjoy in deciding whether to use force under s. 25 of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>. The combination of this broad discretion, the fact that criminal charges must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and the apparent tendency of jurors to give police officers the benefit of the doubt appears to have made it virtually impossible to prosecute police officers criminally for excessive use of force.<sup><a href="#one03">103</a></sup> As in other areas, it also seems to be very difficult to prove that police conduct was racially motivated. The severity of these problems was dramatically indicated by the acquittal of four police officers in Los Angeles for the brutal beating of Rodney King. The officers were acquitted despite the fact that the incident was captured on videotape.<sup><a href="#one04">104</a></sup>
<p>
Although criminal prosecution of officers who engage in racially motivated excessive use of force does not at present appear to be a viable option, these officers are subject to other sanctions. First, they are subject to disciplinary proceedings for breach of provincially legislated guidelines. This may pose a partial solution to the problem. In Ontario, for example, officers' discretion to use firearms is more restricted under provincial legislation than under the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>.<sup><a href="#one05">105</a></sup> Most would agree, however, that the penalties for disciplinary offences, which are limited to dismissal and forfeiture of wages, are not severe enough to reflect the culpability of  officers who engage in racially motivated use of excessive force. Furthermore, it may not be possible to limit officers' discretion to use force in a way that will make it significantly easier to prove racial motivation. Thus, the prospects of being able to punish individual officers for this type of conduct appear bleak.
<p>
In the light of the difficulty of punishing officers who engage in racially motivated use of excessive force, it may be more profitable to focus on regulating the systemic causes of this activity. The current regulations on the use of force in Ontario attempt to do this by mandating annual training in the use of force. The regulations also contain a controversial requirement that officers must file a report every time they discharge a firearm or draw a handgun in the presence of a member of the public.<sup><a href="#one06">106</a></sup> It would also be useful to explore other systemic causes of racially motivated use of deadly force in the context of a coroner's inquest into the deaths of particular individuals. There is no guarantee, however, that this will be possible in any given inquest.<sup><a href="#one07">107</a></sup>
<p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>

This article represents only a preliminary inquiry into the legal strategies that might be used to regulate racially discriminatory police conduct. Thus, it is more appropriate to identify continuing areas of concern than to present any firm conclusions. For instance, it is clear that the law has an important role to play in regulating racially discriminatory police conduct. However, further study should be devoted to determining the exact nature of that role. For example, the problems associated with proving discrimination on the part of individual officers in their decisions to stop, search, and arrest suspects suggest that greater effort needs to be made in determining the extent to which legal mechanisms should be used to address systemic causes of discrimination rather than in punishing officers who engage in discriminatory conduct. 
<p>
This article also suggests a number of areas in which further research is required. The most important category of future research may be enquiries into the extent to which empirical data that demonstrate the existence of systemic discrimination on the part of the police can be used to overcome the difficulties of proving specific instances of discrimination. This research would involve both collecting Canadian data on this point (particularly the quantitative data that would probably be necessary to constitute legal proof) and examining how the data might be used in litigation. It would also be useful to explore the extent to which findings from other jurisdictions can be used in lieu of local data. Further research is also warranted on the difficult issues of remedies and standing that will be involved in bringing some of the claims suggested above against the police.
<p>
In the meantime, it is to be hoped that the Canadian courts will not precipitously foreclose the possibility of using novel causes of action to address a problem whose dimensions are not yet fully understood.

<p>
<li><a name="seventy3">For instance,</a> Sykes &amp; Clark suggest that demeanour is an important situational determinant of police decision making because police-citizen encounters are governed by an &quot;asymmetrical status norm.&quot;  Police expect civilians to demonstrate an amount of deference that varies according to the status of the citizen. The lower the status of the citizen, the more deference he or she is expected to show to the officer. The officer, as a symbol of the community's authority, who is often older and of a higher occupational status than the civilians encountered, is not expected to show as much regard as the lower-status civilian. The problem is that minorities might be unable to distinguish the &quot;general
operation of the asymmetrical status norm from the special asymmetrical norm governing relations based on ethnic stratification.&quot;  Thus, minorities confronted by officers who display an expectation of deference may be more likely to respond with hostility and consequently receive harsher treatment.

DIANA is the collaborative venture of a consortium of law librarians, university based human rights centres, and other non-governmental human rights organizations.  These groups came together to build a comprehensive, timely, and authoritative database of electronic materials essential to human rights research.  Our group takes responsibility for the topic of women's international human rights and is a contributing site for the DIANA database in our area.<p>
<a href="http://www.law.uc.edu:81/Diana/diana.html">Diana Vincent-Davis</a> was the inspiration for this project.  She was the first woman to head the libraries of both the New York University School of Law and Yale Law School. She was appointed law librarian at Yale in 1991. She was especially known for her work in the areas of preservation of library
materials and international human rights. Her numerous publications in those areas include a research guide on human rights law
published in the N.Y.U. Journal of International Law and Politics. At the time of her death she had recently been named
deputy director of the Orville H. Schell, Jr. Center for International Human Rights at Yale Law School. 
This database, inspired by her pioneering work, is dedicated to her memory.

<H1>Defending the Mentally Ill Client in Criminal Matters: Ethics, Advocacy,
and Responsibility<p>
MELODY MARTIN</H1>
<P>
<I>Substantial incentives currently exist to channel mentally ill persons into the criminal justice system, particularly under the auspices of the fitness criterion. For every mentally ill accused person there is at least one criminal defence lawyer, but ethical guidance for counsel acting in these difficult ethical circumstances is sparse. The author asserts that professional conduct codes, secondary source literature,</I> Criminal Code <I>provisions and related substantive case law are insufficient, standing alone, to respond to the unique issues and dilemmas raised by the mentally ill client. The author turns to a diverse set of sources, including civil mental health legislation, principles of biomedical ethics, and key civil and criminal cases, to develop a set of Guiding Principles to assist defence counsel in resolving ethical dilemmas. These Principles are founded on the concept that the lawyer's role must be adapted to meet the special needs of the mentally ill client, and it is asserted that many of the rules and conventions that govern the lawyer's relationship with the &quot;ordinary&quot; client must be modified or reinterpreted if the mentally ill client's interests are to be protected adequately in the criminal process. In particular, the Principles propose that the lawyer take &quot;reasonable steps&quot; to assist the accused in finding appropriate counsel, even when the lawyer has not been retained, or has withdrawn or been discharged; that &quot;capacity,&quot; &quot;consent,&quot; and &quot;substitute judgment&quot; tests be applied to clients whose fitness has not been tried, or whose unfitness has been judicially determined; and that the lawyer follow specified criteria when deciding whether or when to raise the fitness issue, whether to arrange a guilty plea or the withdrawal of charges, and whether to consider herself constrained in the conduct of the defence by the mentally ill client's confession.
<P>
A une &eacute;poque o&ugrave; les seuils de l'enfermement civil involontaire et de traitement sont &eacute;lev&eacute;s et o&ugrave; les amendements aux clauses du</I> Code <I>p&eacute;nal concernant les maladies mentales ont accru l'accessibilit&eacute; et l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t suscit&eacute;s par l'&eacute;valuation et le processus de r&eacute;vision pour les personnes d&eacute;clar&eacute;es non-responsables ou incapables de compara&icirc;tre en cour, de nombreux motifs permettraient de canaliser les personnes atteintes de  d&eacute;s&eacute;quilibre mental dans le syst&egrave;me judiciaire p&eacute;nal et tout particuli&egrave;rement
sous les auspices du crit&egrave;re de capacit&eacute; mentale. Il y a au moins un avocat pour chaque malade mental accus&eacute;, mais les pr&eacute;c&eacute;dents en mati&eacute;re &eacute;thiques dans les cas de cette nature sont plut&ocirc;t rares. L'auteur affirme que les codes de conduite professionnelle, les &eacute;crits de seconde source, les articles du Code p&eacute;nal et la jurisprudence en la mati&egrave;re ne suffisent pas, s'ils ne s'appuient pas sur des fondements solides, pour r&eacute;pondre aux probl&egrave;mes sp&eacute;cifiques et aux
dilemmes soulev&eacute;s par le client souffrant de troubles mentaux. L'auteur se tourne vers diverses sources regroupant les lois civiles en mati&egrave;re de sant&eacute; mentale, les principes de l'&eacute;thique  biom&eacute;dicale, ainsi que des cas typiques de droit civil et p&eacute;nal afin de d&eacute;finir un ensemble de principes didactiques permettant d'aider l'avocat devant des dilemmes &eacute;thiques. Ces principes sont  fond&eacute;s sur un concept qui veut que le r&ocirc;le de l'avocat doit s'adapter aux besoins sp&eacute;cifiques
du client atteint de troubles mentaux. L'auteur consid&egrave;re &eacute;galement qu'il est n&eacute;cessaire de changer ou de r&eacute;interpr&eacute;ter plusieurs r&egrave;gles et conventions qui r&eacute;gissent les relations entre l'avocat et le client &quot;ordinaire&quot; si les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts du patient malade mental peuvent &ecirc;tre convenablement prot&eacute;g&eacute;s dans le processus p&eacute;nal. En outre, ces principes recommandent que l'avocat prenne les &quot;dispositions n&eacute;cessaires&quot; visant &agrave; aider l'accus&eacute; &agrave; trouver un avocat convenable, m&ecirc;me si l'avocat n'a pas &eacute;t&eacute; retenu, s'est retir&eacute; ou a &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;mis; que les tests de &quot;capacit&eacute;&quot;, de &quot;consentement&quot; ou de &quot;subrogations&quot; soient appliqu&eacute;s aux clients dont la capacit&eacute; n'a pas &eacute;t&eacute; mise en cause, ou dont l'incapacit&eacute; l&eacute;gale a &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;tablie; et que l'avocat suive des crit&egrave;res pr&eacute;cis dans la d&eacute;cision de faire ou non relever le cas de l'incapacit&eacute; et &agrave; quel moment, dans le choix de plaider coupable ou de faire retirer l'accusation et de se consid&eacute;rer contraint dans la conduite de la d&eacute;fense par la confession du client malade mental.</I>

<H3>Introduction:  Issues and Organization</H3>

A. AN INTRODUCTION TO MENTAL ILLNESS IN THE CRIMINAL  AND CIVIL SYSTEMS
<P>
In every country, a percentage of the population suffers from some form of mental illness. A small proportion of this group will, as a result of mental illness, manifest behaviours that can be classified as criminal offences. Among
those whose behaviour can be so classified, there is a large degree of diversity: individuals vary in terms of the type and seriousness of offence committed, the type of mental illness suffered, the severity and chronic nature of the illness, and the forms of associated cognitive, affective, and behavioural disturbance. The treatability of the mental illness (in terms of both the individual's physiological response to medications and willingness to accept treatment) is also variable among individuals and throughout the life span of any particular individual.
<P>
What is common to mentally ill persons who commit criminal offences is the issues that are raised for the persons themselves, and for their families, friends, and society at large. The issues include the need to provide assistance, protection, and treatment for the individual, support for family members and friends who care for the individual in the community, and protection for society. There is also a need (particularly, but not exclusively, in the civil context) to respect the individual's choices, and to protect the individual's right to maintain, for example, her liberty and the security of her person. In the judicial and administrative systems it is necessary to ensure the individual's participation in, and comprehension of, the process, and to maintain the integrity of that process in the eyes of the individual and the public. These purposes and needs are frequently in tension, and the task of resolving competing claims often leads to difficult dilemmas for legislators, health care providers, families, and the administrative and judicial systems.
<P>
What is the role of the lawyer in this process? More specifically, what is the role of the criminal lawyer? The process of finding answers to these questions may be facilitated by an understanding of the basic characteristics of the two systems, civil mental health and criminal justice, which are called on to deal with mentally ill persons. In particular, it is important to understand the differences between the threshold (entry) tests of the two systems, and the motivations that concerned parties (family members, friends, and others) may have for invoking one system rather than the other.
<P>
Concerned parties often have two primary goals: to ensure that the criminal behaviour ceases, and to secure for the mentally ill person the treatment (such as medication and hospitalization) that will enable her or him to achieve a better state of mental health. In many of these cases, the mentally ill person will not accept and maintain treatment voluntarily. Concerned parties and the police have the option of invoking either the criminal justice system (through
the laying of a criminal charge) or the civil mental health system.<SUP><A HREF="#one">1</A></SUP> Assuming that the criminal behaviour is caused by (or at least related to) the mental illness, and given that the civil system is responsible for mental health, it would appear that the civil mental health system is the better choice. However, an examination of the threshold test for the civil system, relative to that of the criminal system, reveals that it is much more difficult for concerned parties to reach their primary goals through the civil system.
<P>
Civil mental health law in Ontario, under the provincial <CITE>Mental Health Act</CITE>, is strongly influenced by a policy of non-institutional care (sometimes referred to as &quot;community care&quot;).<SUP><A  HREF="#two">2 </A></SUP>  A series of alterations to the <CITE>Act</CITE> over the past twenty years has led to the establishment of a very high threshold for involuntary hospitalization (&quot;civil commitment&quot;).  Neither the mentally ill person's apparent need for treatment nor the troublesome (or even criminal) nature of the person's behaviour is grounds for hospitalization; rather, the standard is one of &quot;dangerousness,&quot; which
asks only whether, on the basis of past behaviour or threats, the mentally ill person is &quot;likely&quot; to cause &quot;serious bodily harm&quot; to himself or others.<SUP><A HREF="#three">3 </A></SUP>  Even if this standard is met, the mentally ill person may not be detained for more than a very brief period of time: the initial certificate expires after 72 hours, and subsequent certificates, which are for periods such as two weeks and one month, are subject to review before a Review Board (and ultimately by a court). The standard for involuntary treatment is even higher than the standard for involuntary hospitalization, and the hospitalized mentally ill person may be found &quot;competent&quot; to refuse treatment. The result is that a mentally ill person who does meet the &quot;dangerousness&quot; commitment standard can be &quot;warehoused&quot; in hospital without receiving treatment to correct the behaviour that led to the hospitalization. These situations---the high threshold for commitment, and the even higher threshold for treatment---are the result of a determination about the appropriate balance of values; but while these high standards provide important procedural protection for the mentally ill person, they can be a source of great frustration for concerned parties who are unable to secure adequate care for the mentally ill person and who cannot ensure that the criminal behaviour will cease.
<P>
The criminal justice system, oriented as it is towards the determination of culpability and the punishment and correction of intentional wrongdoing, would seem initially to be an inappropriate venue for the mentally ill person;
however, a comparison of the criminal threshold test with that of the civil system reveals that the former is not only much lower, but also offers a much greater incentive for treatment. The test, which is &quot;fitness to stand trial,&quot; focuses not on dangerousness, but on cognitive capabilities such as the ability to understand the &quot;nature or object&quot; and &quot;possible consequences&quot; of the proceedings, and ability to &quot;communicate with counsel.&quot;<sup><a href="#four">4</a></sup> Since many of the mentally ill persons who commit criminal offences are suffering from psychoses (illnesses which impair cognitive functioning), these persons may experience difficulty in meeting a cognitively-based test.<a href="#five">5</a></sup> And although the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> requires that persons found unfit to stand trial be subject to the disposition that is &quot;the least onerous and least restrictive,&quot;<sup><a href="#six">6</a></sup> it is often determined that the least restrictive disposition is placement in a mental hospital (rather than in the community).<sup><a href="#seven">7</a></sup> Further, since &quot;capping&quot; provisions, which would limit the length of time that the unfit accused spends under criminal jurisdiction, have not yet been proclaimed,<sup><a href="#eight">8</a></sup> the incentive for a mentally ill accused person to accept treatment is quite strong. Treatment is frequently &quot;a must&quot; if the accused person hopes to become well enough to be found fit to stand trial.<sup><a href="#nine">9</a></sup>
<p>
Further, the criminal justice system makes use of many of the same hospitals, and the same mental health care professionals, as the civil system. In other words, the mentally ill person who is charged with a criminal offence and found unfit to stand trial could be placed on the same hospital ward with the same doctor that he would have had if the concerned parties had been able to secure commitment and treatment for him under the civil system. When one
compares the obstacles placed along the civil route---the high civil threshold---with the relative smoothness of the criminal process---the lower threshold for a finding of unfitness---it can readily be seen that there is an incentive for concerned parties to channel mentally ill persons into the criminal justice system.
<p>
There is some empirical support for the proposition that the number of mentally ill persons in the criminal justice
system, as measured by the fitness criterion, is increasing. In 1983, only 18 unfit persons were held on a Warrant of the Lieutenant Governor in Ontario, and only 120 were so held in Canada as a whole.<sup><a href="#ten">10</a></sup> In 1992, the number of unfit persons <i>entering</i> the system in Ontario alone skyrocketed to 153.<sup><a href="#eleven">11</a></sup> The incidence of custody in hospital for mentally ill accused persons is also increasing: in 1983, approximately one third of the persons held on warrants in Canada (unfit and insanity combined) were living in the community, but in 1992, <i>after</i> the enactment of reforms to the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> that were designed to provide the unfit accused with the &quot;least restrictive alternative&quot; (that is, a presumption against custody in hospital), fewer than 10 of the 153 persons found unfit to stand trial in Ontario were placed in the community.<sup><a href="#twelve">12</a></sup> It is of course possible that these &quot;new entries&quot; will remain unfit (and remain in hospital) for relatively short periods of time; a brief period of hospitalization may serve to stabilize the unfit person's mental condition, at least temporarily, so that he may stand trial and be acquitted, convicted, or found Not Criminally Responsible (NCR), and possibly placed in the community. It also remains to be seen whether new entries who remain unfit for extended periods of time will be transferred to the community.
<p>
It has been suggested above that a possible explanation for these increases is the tightening of civil standards for involuntary hospitalization and treatment, which has rendered the criminal system a more attractive option for concerned parties. An alternative (or additional) hypothesis is that the recent reforms to the criminal system have both increased the attractiveness of a finding of unfitness for the defence, and increased the likelihood that the criminal system will identify accused persons who are mentally ill. Al O'Marra, former counsel to the Ontario Criminal Code Review Board (OCCRB), suggests that the revised time limitation for assessment orders (five days rather than 30 days), and the substantive and procedural reforms that require an unfit accused's case to be reviewed on carefully-enumerated criteria and with greater frequency, have made defence counsel less reluctant to raise
the issue of fitness.<sup><a href="#thirteen">13</a></sup> O'Marra also suggests that an increase in the number
of accused persons taking advantage of the attractively short assessment orders has led to an increased detection rate for unfitness. If O'Marra's dual hypothesis is valid, it need not be true that more mentally ill persons are entering the criminal justice system; rather, it may simply be that a greater percentage of the (actually unfit) accused persons who would otherwise have slipped through the criminal system with a guilty plea or with a conviction or acquittal are now being identified as unfit. It is difficult to obtain empirical data to support or contradict these hypotheses,<sup><a href="#fourteen">14</a></sup> but regardless of whether one, both, or neither can be confirmed through empirical data, it remains clear that there are significantly more persons of unfit status in the criminal justice system than there have been in the past. It is the task of the defence lawyer to relate to these persons and to the systems involved, and to deal with the issues that the mentally ill accused person's situation raises.
<p>
B. ORGANIZATIONAL FRAMEWORK: ETHICAL QUESTIONS, AND WAYS TO FIND ANSWERS
<p>
(a) <i>Issues and Difficulties</i><br>
For every person found unfit to stand trial, there is at least one criminal defence lawyer. The lawyer for the mentally ill client will face several unique and complex issues, including:
<blockquote>
<i>(1) The Lawyer's Competence.</i> Lawyers are usually not trained in understanding mental illness. How should a lawyer determine whether she is competent to act for a mentally ill client? How should she react when the client resists her assistance?
<p>
<i>(2) Confidentiality.</i> When and to whom can lawyers disclose information about their mentally ill clients? Is the client's &quot;consent to disclose&quot; valid? Can lawyers discuss the mentally ill client's legal situation with others such as the client's psychiatrist or family members?
<p>
<i>(3) Instructions.</i> What should the lawyer do if the client is too ill to give instructions? What should she do when the client's instructions are bizarre, or would be detrimental to the client's case?
<p>
<i>(4) Legal Objectives.</i> How should the lawyer determine &quot;what to aim for&quot;: should the lawyer always resist a finding of unfitness or Not Criminally Responsible, or should the lawyer attempt to persuade the Court to make these findings, given that both enable the client to avoid a conviction?
<p>
<i>(5) Tensions between the Obligation to the Client and the Obligation to the Court.</i> When does the lawyer
owe a duty not to disclose information about the client's mental condition? When does the lawyer's concealment of facts or suspicions about the client's mental condition amount to deceiving the court?
</blockquote>
Issues such as these suggest that the lawyer may need to adapt her understanding of her role and responsibilities to the special needs of the mentally ill client. But how is the lawyer to define that role? When seeking guidance on questions of professional responsibility, the first source to be consulted is usually the various codes of professional conduct. But the Canadian Bar Association (CBA) Rules of Professional Conduct,<sup><a href="#fifteen">15</a></sup> the Rules of the Law Society of Upper Canada (LSUC),<sup><a href="#sixteen">16</a></sup> and even the LSUC Professional Standards Committee's Criminal Law Defense Counsel Checklist<sup><a href="#seventeen">17</a></sup> offer general rules that do not yield a clear answer to the question of how to act for a client who is not able to give instructions and make decisions in the way that &quot;ordinary&quot; clients do. The American Bar Association (ABA) has formulated a specific Model Rule to govern acting for the &quot;Client Under a Disability,&quot;<sup><a href="#eighteen">18</a></sup> and has also adopted a comprehensive set of rules known as the <cite>Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards</cite>,<sup><a href="#nineteen">19</a></sup> both of which are helpful and suggestive; however, differences between Canada and the United States in both substantive law and general professional conduct rules place limits on the direct application of some of these provisions in the Canadian context.
<p>
If the professional conduct rules do not provide sufficient direction, the second source would ordinarily be academic treatises and articles written by members of the profession who work with mentally ill clients. However,  surprisingly little has been written on the subject of legal advocacy with the mentally ill criminal defendant.<sup><a href="#twenty">20</a></sup> Small but growing bodies of literature address related topics such as advocacy with mentally ill persons in the civil context,<sup><a href="#twenty1">21</a></sup> and advocacy with mentally retarded persons in civil and criminal contexts,<sup><a href="#twenty2">22</a></sup> but these topics raise somewhat different issues: the most notable are the disparate purposes of the criminal and civil systems, and the
differences in mental state between clients whose mental condition is stable and unlikely to vary or improve significantly over time (mentally retarded clients)<sup><a href="#twenty3">23</a></sup> and those whose mental condition is quite variable and may improve appreciably with medical treatment (mentally ill clients). The limited number of academic treatises and articles written by members of the practising profession renders these materials insufficient, standing alone, to provide a meaningful answer to the question: &quot;What is the criminal defence lawyer's role when acting for a mentally ill client?&quot;
<p>
The criminal defence lawyer can also seek guidance from legislation and case law addressing the fitness test and
the NCR (formerly &quot;insanity&quot;) defence. However, the fitness test determines only whether the accused is capable of standing trial: it offers little purchase on the relationship between lawyer and client, or on the lawyer's role <i>per se</i>. The lawyer must act for the mentally ill person before the fitness hearing is held, and many key issues, such as how to make decisions when the client is incapable of giving instructions, or how to decide what to do when the instructions he does give seem impracticable, cannot be resolved by simple reference to the fitness rule. This is not to suggest that the fitness rule and recent judgments that interpret its scope offer no assistance in devising
principled guidelines for the defence lawyer; on the contrary, these materials contribute substantially to the question of how the mentally ill client's role compares with that of the &quot;ordinary client.&quot;  For example, <cite>R. v. Taylor</cite>,<sup><a href="#twenty4">24</a></sup> recently decided by the Ontario Court of Appeal, and the Quebec Court of Appeal's decision in <cite>R. v. Brigham</cite>,<sup><a href="#twenty5">25</a></sup> both of which draw upon the Supreme Court of Canada's judgment in <cite>R. v. Swain</cite>,<sup><a href="#twenty6">26</a></sup> have already addressed some issues regarding the scope of the mentally ill client's
decision-making responsibilities in the conduct of a criminal case. These decisions will be discussed in considerable detail in Section II.E below. However, the contribution of statutory and case law to the development of a set of ethical guidelines is necessarily limited; an understanding of the lawyer's role when acting for mentally ill clients must be grounded initially in an ethical base, and particular legislative provisions and case law interpreting such provisions serve to illustrate and clarify, rather than support, explain, and justify, the lawyer's professional responsibilities. The lawyer's decisions should be derived from principled standards and applied within the context of particular legislative structures, rather than merely extrapolated from legislation and case law---especially when such legislation and case law are principally intended to give substance to the substantive law, rather than to delineate the lawyer's professional responsibilities. This orientation will guide the discussion of statutory and case law in this article.
<p>
The paucity of ethical guidelines in the three sources (codes of professional conduct, secondary sources, and statutory and case law) is disturbing because it is apparent that defence lawyers for mentally ill clients are required to make difficult ethical determinations on a daily basis. Currently these decisions are presumably being made on the basis of the individual lawyer's values and judgment. However well-intentioned lawyers may be, there is cause for concern that methods of advocacy (and particularly decision-making) for mentally ill clients may not always be ethically well-informed, and methods will vary significantly from one lawyer to the next.
<p>
What is needed is a set of professional guidelines or principles that can give structure to the types of decisions that individual lawyers are called upon to make. The fundamental question is the appropriate scope of the lawyer's role when acting for a mentally ill client.<sup><a href="#twenty7">27</a></sup> If a principled answer to this question
cannot be found in existing sources, it must be created. The goal of such an endeavour would be to formulate ethical intuitions about the lawyer's role into concepts that are broad enough to govern a variety of specific situations, yet
are clear enough to be practically applied. The result would be the development of a set of Guiding Principles. This endeavour, goal, and result will be the task of this article.
<p>
(b) <i>Strategy and Methods</i><br>
How will this project be accomplished, in the absence of sufficient specific rules of professional conduct, secondary sources, or applicable legislation and case law? What materials will form the basis for a set of principled guidelines? 
Even more importantly, on what grounds would the conclusions be defended from charges of subjectivism and relativity? One initial method of approach is to postpone temporarily the task of defining the lawyer's role---and the task of considering the three problematic traditional sources---and begin instead by endeavouring to define the mentally ill client's role. Focusing on the relationship between the lawyer and the client reveals that the lawyer and the client are, in a sense, counterparts; identifying which capacities, responsibilities, and duties are appropriately vested in the client (despite, or even as a result of, his mental illness) brings us closer to determining the part that the lawyer should play.
<p>
Starting with the client also has the advantage of opening up rich and suggestive ethical and legal resources, such as
the principles of biomedical ethics, judgments in significant cases addressing questions of medical ethics, and various types of mental health legislation. These materials would seem, at first glance, to pertain to substantive issues idiosyncratic to the medical context (such as informed consent to medical treatment, criteria for capacity to consent to treatment, negligence, and battery). However, closer examination reveals that these materials address the question of the appropriate role for the mentally ill person in a decision-making context. For example, these materials ask: how do we determine which decisions the mentally ill person is capable of making? How can we be
sure that his acquiescence or understanding is sufficient for the decisions that need to be made? If he is unable to make decisions, who should make them, and how should they be made? These questions are the same questions that the criminal defence lawyer will need to answer.
<p>
C.  STRUCTURE
<p>
The next section of the article (Section II) examines a variety of materials that could serve as possible sources for the development of ethical principles in the criminal defence context. These sources include the four principles of biomedical ethics, and recent initiatives in civil mental health legislation, such as the <cite>Consent to Treatment Act</cite>, the <cite>Advocacy Act</cite>, and the <cite>Substitute Decisions Act</cite>,<sup><a href="#twenty8">28</a></sup> in addition to older legislation such as the <cite>Mental Health Act</cite> and the
<cite>Mental Incompetency Act</cite>.<sup><a href="#twenty9">29</a></sup> Key judgments on the subject of informed consent are discussed briefly, and recent decisions that interpret the mental disorder provisions of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> are examined in some detail.
<p>
In Section III the observations drawn from the sources in Section II will be integrated, expanded, and ordered. The resulting conclusions will provide a set of proposed Guiding Principles for the criminal defence lawyer.
<p>
<h3>II.  Developing Principles</h3>

This section explores the answers to two major questions: &quot;What is the appropriate scope of the mentally ill person's decision-making role?&quot; and &quot;What are the corresponding responsibilities of the professional?&quot;
<p>
A. BIOMEDICAL ETHICS<sup><a href="#thirty">30</a></sup>
<p>
The principles of biomedical ethics set out the basic interests that are at stake in most medical and scientific contexts. The four principles are (1) autonomy, which includes the concept of informed consent; (2) non-maleficence; (3) beneficence; and (4) justice. These principles are interrelated, but often lead to conflicting results. They must be balanced in the context of particular cases or sets of cases, or particular circumstances (for example, medical, or for present purposes, legal circumstances). In different combinations, the four principles underlie civil and criminal legislation governing mentally ill persons, and may also be found within case law and professional codes. The principles will also be relevant to the task of developing a set of Guiding Principles.
<p>
The principle of autonomy refers to the individual's inherent right to form his own life plan and to make his own choices in the furtherance of his goals. As long as the individual does not act so as to constrain the autonomy of others (for example, by causing physical harm to others---John Stuart Mill's &quot;harm principle&quot;), he must be free to live as he chooses and to bear the consequences of his own choices. The principle of autonomy is often invoked in discussions of involuntary civil commitment; the argument from an autonomy perspective is that the individual has an inherent right to make his own choices (which include being eccentric, or psychotic, or living on the streets), and the state (and, by extension, the medical and legal professions) has no right to interfere, as long
as the individual is not &quot;hurting&quot; anyone else.
<p>
But in order to make autonomous choices, the individual must have sufficient information: in the medical context, this is known as &quot;informed consent.&quot;  What constitutes &quot;informed consent&quot; will vary   according to the particular context; the amount and type of information necessary will vary according to the nature of the decision to be made, the relevant risks or costs, possible benefits, and the implications of the decision for the individual. A second pre-condition for autonomous choice is that the individual possess the capacity to make the
choice. In the words of Tom Beauchamp and James Childress, &quot;[the principle of autonomy] does not apply to persons who are not in a position to act in a sufficiently autonomous manner---perhaps because they are immature,
incapacitated, ignorant, coerced, or in a position in which they can be exploited by others.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty1">31</a></sup>
<p>
A nuanced explanation of &quot;the incompetence exception to informed consent&quot; is provided by D. Don Welch:
<blockquote>
[c]ompetence is the measure of whether persons possess the capability for autonomous action. Incompetence
means that persons are not able to exercise self-determination in a meaningful way. When persons are not able to understand their own situations, when they are unable to comprehend the likely results of alternative procedures, then those persons are not autonomous in the context of the particular purpose and setting at hand. Self-determination is not possible, and informed consent in its ordinary meaning cannot be a reality.<sup><a href="#thirty2">32</a></sup>
</blockquote>
What constitutes &quot;competence&quot; and &quot;informed consent&quot; will vary from one context to another, based on the type of decision to be made; in other words, an individual could be competent to make one type of decision, such as to consent to treatment, but not be competent to make another type of decision, such as to manage an estate. The foundation of the principle of autonomy is respect for the individual: if the individual is competent to make the decision in question, and is given sufficient information to make the decision, her decision---no matter how wrong it may seem to others---must be respected.
<p>
The principles of non-maleficence and beneficence are closely related. The former, put very simply, means &quot;do no harm,&quot; while the latter means &quot;do good.&quot; Non-maleficence includes the concept of &quot;due care,&quot; which involves carefully evaluating the risk of harm; it also includes a process of weighing harms against benefits. It can imply a &quot;best interests&quot; test, which is an &quot;objective&quot; (reasonable person) standard for determining what is &quot;best&quot; for the incompetent person. Another  possible test is the &quot;substitute judgment&quot; standard, which requires the decision-maker to try to make the
decision that the incompetent person would have made, had he been competent. In other words, a subjective element is added to the &quot;best interests&quot; calculus, in the sense that the substitute decision-maker is charged with inquiring into the preferences, values, and beliefs of the individual incompetent person, and extrapolating from these to make the decision on the incompetent person's behalf.
<p>
The principle of beneficence involves a duty to &quot;do good&quot; by conferring benefits on another or furthering another's interests. In the medical context, this is spoken of as the physician's &quot;duty&quot; to her patients or to society; in the legal context, it might be expressed as the lawyer's duty to her clients, to the court, or to the profession. Like non-maleficence, beneficence also involves cost and risk-benefit calculi. The principle of beneficence also brings to the fore the concept of &quot;paternalism,&quot; which involves &quot;overriding&quot; individual choices or preferences (such as the preference of a client or patient to have certain information, or the preference of a client or patient to make a choice that the professional believes will be
destructive) in favour of what the professional thinks would be &quot;for the best.&quot;  The paternalism element of the principle of beneficence directly contradicts the principle of autonomy. Welch explains the tension in this way:
<blockquote>
Whereas beneficence leads us to think teleologically, in terms of ends and consequences, the bioethical principle of autonomy leads us to think deontologically, in terms of fidelity to first principles and established values. In the informed consent context, autonomy leads us to think specifically in terms of principles and values related to the dignity of persons. Respecting a patient's autonomy does not necessarily entail concern for consequences and thus can be at odds with a physician's vision of medical benefit.<sup><a href="#thirty3">33</a></sup>
</blockquote>
In a legal and medical context, the paternalist argument is often invoked in the context of withholding certain portions of a psychiatric patient's clinical record, on the grounds that it would injure the patient or would cause harm to the therapeutic relationship if the record were disclosed. It is also invoked to justify involuntarily detaining a mentally ill person in hospital or subjecting him to treatment on the grounds that he would be better off as a result of this intervention.
<p>
The principle of justice refers to the allocation of risks, harms, and benefits across members of a group or society. 
This principle is often invoked in the context of scarce life-saving technologies, and in the context of choosing research subjects (who, by definition, incur risks of harm so that others may benefit from the results). Despite its suggestive name, the principle of justice is less relevant in the context of this article than are the other three principles.
<p>
The bioethical principles, in and of themselves, do not yield any particular conclusions that could be readily translated into the criminal defence context; their role is rather to identify the factors, or sets of interests, that come
into play. The principles are tools for analysis, in the sense that they provide a framework within which to examine judicial decisions, legislation, and ethical dilemmas <i>per se</i>. The first three principles---or, more specifically, a balance between the first three principles---are readily apparent within the new mental health legislation, which will be discussed shortly. At this juncture, it is sufficient to note that the principles have a direct bearing on issues such as the evaluation of capacity to make decisions and to consent to procedures (principle of autonomy, and particularly the concepts of cognitive capacity and informed consent); respect for the seemingly irrational choices of individuals (principle of autonomy); and the duty of the professional (principles of beneficence and non-maleficence). These issues are as relevant to the criminal defence lawyer as they are to the health care professional in a medical context.
<P>
B. KEY CIVIL CASES
<P>
The four principles have been applied by the Supreme Court of Canada in three important civil cases. These cases address informed consent, the concept of &quot;best interests,&quot; and substitute decision-making more  generally. Each of these issues has an application in the criminal defence context.
<p>
The first two cases are <cite>Hopp v. Lepp</cite><sup><a href="#thirty4">34</a></sup> and <cite>Reibl v. Hughes</cite>.<sup><a href="#thirty5">35</a></sup> Both may be classified as &quot;medical malpractice&quot; cases, and both address the duty and scope of disclosure. In <cite>Hopp v. Lepp</cite>, Laskin C.J.C. (for the Court) defined the patient's entitlement to &quot;informed consent&quot; in terms of the physician's duty to disclose. He held that consent to a surgical operation required the doctor to disclose &quot;the nature of the proposed operation, its gravity, any material risks and any special or unusual risks attendant upon the performance of the operation.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty6">36</a></sup> Also, the surgeon &quot;generally, should answer any specific questions posed by the patient as to the risks involved.&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty7">37</a></sup> The patient was entitled to information sufficient to enable him to decide whether to undergo surgery; the specific content of this information would, of course, vary on a case-by-case basis. While the surgeon is entitled to &quot;some leeway&quot;<sup><a href="#thirty8">38</a></sup> to adapt the disclosure to the emotional condition of the particular patient, it must be kept in mind that the decision to accept or refuse surgery rests with the patient, and the surgeon must disclose enough information to enable the patient to make the choice for himself.
<p>
In <cite>Reibl v. Hughes</cite>, Laskin C.J.C. (for the Court) emphasized that the duty of disclosure is &quot;the patient's right to know what risks are involved&quot; in having the surgery (or other treatment) or not having it.<sup><a href="#thirty9">39</a></sup> The patient is entitled to be informed of all material risks, and what the
doctor &quot;knows or should know that the particular patient deems relevant to a decision whether to undergo prescribed treatment&quot;<sup><a href="#forty">40</a></sup> will be a factor in the court's determination of the scope of the duty of disclosure. Laskin C.J.C. held that it is for the courts, and not the medical profession, to determine the scope of this duty. The content of the duty to disclose should be established by an objective (&quot;reasonable person&quot;) test, but this test should be tailored to the patient's particular circumstances.<sup><a href="#forty1">41</a></sup>
<p>
The third case, <cite>E. (Mrs) v. Eve</cite>,<sup><a href="#forty2">42</a></sup> addressed the exercise of the court's <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction over mentally incompetent persons. The court did not address the determination of incompetence, but rather focused on the nature and scope of the <i>parens patriae</i> power, and the applicability of the &quot;best interests&quot; and &quot;substituted judgment&quot; tests. La Forest J. (for the Court) held that the <i>parens patriae</i> power should only be used for the benefit (in terms of the physical or mental health) of the incompetent individual. He proceeded to hold that this power should not be employed for the benefit of others, even though the failure to exercise the discretion to authorize a medical procedure for an incompetent person (in this case, non-therapeutic sterilization) could impose serious burdens on others (in this case, on the mother of the incompetent person). Emphasis was placed on the need to exercise &quot;great caution&quot; in consenting on behalf of the incompetent person,<sup><a href="#forty3">43</a></sup> and La Forest J. was very critical of the &quot;substituted judgment test&quot;; he argued that this test is a mere legal fiction and is based on &quot;speculation,&quot; since others---no matter how sensitive and conscientious---can never really know what decision the incompetent person would have made.<sup><a href="#forty4">44</a></sup> La
Forest J. also criticised the &quot;best interests&quot; test as vague and difficult to apply. Nevertheless, the &quot;best interests&quot; test was favoured over the &quot;substituted judgment&quot; test because the former at least recognizes that the consent offered is not that of the incompetent person, but rather is a decision made by others as a result of the need to make <i>a</i> choice in circumstances of necessity.
<p>
<cite>Hopp v. Lepp</cite> and <cite>Reibl v. Hughes</cite> are representative of judicial endeavours to establish basic principles governing the type of information that would constitute a pre-condition for informed consent (or, in other words, the scope of the duty of disclosure). Both cases can be seen to emphasize the principle of autonomy in medical decision-making. The <cite>Eve</cite> case is different because issues of informed consent and disclosure do not arise when the individual is incompetent (that is, a person cannot give &quot;informed consent&quot; to a decision that she is incompetent to make). <cite>Eve</cite> raises the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence, and the central insight of the case is that the court's <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction (paternalistic powers) must be exercised carefully and sparingly, and only in the &quot;best interests&quot; of the incompetent person. Combining the insights of these three cases, one could draw the following general conclusions. The competent individual is entitled to make her own decisions about matters fundamental to her life and health, and there is a duty on the professional to provide her with the information necessary to make those decisions. The
incompetent individual is entitled to the protection of paternalistic measures, but paternalism should be exercised cautiously and only in the best interests of the incompetent person herself.
<p>
These basic concepts could also be applied in the criminal defence context. Expressed as a general proposition, it
could be said that like the doctor, the lawyer should provide the mentally competent client with sufficient information to make his own decisions in matters affecting his case, but where the client is incompetent, the lawyer,
like the court, should make the decision that is in the best interests of the client. On the latter point, it should be noted that La Forest J.'s discussion (in <cite>Eve</cite>) of the <i>parens patriae</i> power was addressed to the scope and exercise of the court's inherent jurisdiction. Defence counsel's position relative to the incompetent client is not directly analogous to the court's position relative to the incompetent person, because defence counsel, though an officer of the court, does not share <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction. Neither does she wield the authority of the state. Nonetheless, on the level of principle, an argument could be made that a form of paternalistic authority is in fact vested in the lawyer, in the sense that the lawyer may be called on to make decisions that the client, by reason of his mental illness, is unable to make. In so far as the analysis in the <cite>Eve</cite> case can be applied to paternalistic authority more generally, one could conclude that it is sometimes necessary to adopt and exercise a paternalistic role, but that this power should be exercised sparingly and should be carefully circumscribed.
<p>
C. MENTAL HEALTH LEGISLATION
<p>
The next source for analysis is the &quot;new&quot; and &quot;old&quot; mental health legislation. It is important to note first that a distinction can be drawn between &quot;capacity&quot; or &quot;competence,&quot; and &quot;consent.&quot;  The former refer to the <i>ability</i> to make a given decision, while the latter refers to the actual decision that is made. Second, the new legislative initiatives reflect a definite movement from the concept of &quot;global incompetency&quot; (that is, the idea that a person is &quot;an incompetent&quot; and accordingly is incompetent for all purposes) to a concept of &quot;specific incapacity&quot; (that is, the concept of &quot;capacity <i>to</i>&quot; make certain decisions but not others).<sup><a href="#forty5">45</a></sup> This is also reflected in the change of terminology, from &quot;competence&quot; to &quot;capacity,&quot; and is in keeping with the recommendations of the Weisstub Enquiry. The Enquiry recommended the adoption of the concept of &quot;decisional capacity&quot; and the use of a &quot;functional&quot; analysis in assessing capacity (that is, the assessment of the &quot;specific functional requirements&quot; necessary to make particular decisions).<sup><a href="#forty6">46</a></sup> Third, the new legislation provides guidelines that are considerably more specific than the old with regard to how substitute decision makers are chosen, and what criteria these persons are expected to use when making decisions for the incapable mentally ill person.
<p>
It must also be noted that the new pieces of legislation (the <cite>Consent to Treatment Act</cite>, the <cite>Advocacy Act</cite>, the <cite>Substitute Decisions Act</cite>, and a &quot;house cleaning&quot; <cite>Act</cite> entitled Bill 110 which amends and alters other pieces of legislation) have only recently been proclaimed. This legislation will bring about significant structural and substantive changes in the civil mental health
system. For example, the Review Boards that currently operate under the <cite>Mental Health Act</cite> will be renamed &quot;Consent and Capacity Review Boards,&quot; and the criteria on which the decisions are based will be altered in keeping with the provisions of the <cite>Consent to Treatment Act</cite>. The <cite>Mental Incompetency Act</cite> will be repealed, and the system of &quot;committees of the estate&quot; and &quot;committees of the person&quot; will be replaced by a detailed set of provisions governing the selection of substitute decision makers for specific purposes. An &quot;Advocacy Commission&quot; will be established to oversee a network of advocates for mentally and physically disabled persons.
<p>
Both old and new legislation are relevant for the purposes of this article because they define the scope of three key issues that are common to both criminal and civil contexts. These issues are (1) definitions of competency or  capacity; (2) definitions of informed consent; and (3) criteria governing the responsibilities of substitute decision makers. One key difference between the civil and criminal contexts is that the civil legislation contemplates an administrative structure with a division of responsibility (&quot;checks and balances&quot;) between the health practitioner, the Board or Court, the patient advocate, the substitute decision maker, and the client, with rights of appeal, and other protections. The lawyer in a criminal defence context may be called upon to assume all of these roles at once; for example, she may need to make a determination of the client's capacity to retain her, decide whether she has in fact been retained, provide the information that she believes is sufficient to permit the client to make an informed decision, determine whether the client's consent (for example, to a psychiatric assessment) is voluntary, and make decisions on behalf of the client (for example, whether to arrange for an assessment) when he is unable to do so. Nevertheless, the criteria to be considered in the three categories ((1)--(3) above) can help to give practical substance to the question of which responsibilities should be vested in the mentally ill person, and how this determination should be made.
<p>
(a)   <i>Incompetency and Incapacity</i><br>
<dd>1.  <i>Definitions</i><br>
The definitions of incompetency and incapacity provided by the old legislation are not as specific as those in the new legislation. For example, the <cite>Mental Incompetency Act</cite> defines a &quot;mentally incompetent person&quot; as a person &quot;in whom there is such a condition of arrested or incomplete development of mind . . . or who is suffering from such a disorder of the mind . . . that the person requires care, supervision and control for his or her protection and the protection of his or her property.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty7">47</a></sup> There are no explicit criteria to be used in making this determination. The <cite>Mental Health Act</cite> offers a slightly more nuanced definition of mental competence: it provides that &quot;`mentally competent' means  having the ability to understand the subject-matter in respect of which consent is requested (which in turn means &quot;having the ability to understand the nature of the illness for which treatment is proposed and the treatment proposed&quot;) and able to appreciate the consequences of giving or withholding consent.&quot;<sup><a href="#forty8">48</a></sup>
<p>
By contrast, the new <cite>Consent to Treatment Act</cite> provides:
<blockquote>     
6(1) A person is capable with respect to a treatment if the person is able to understand the information that is relevant to making a decision concerning the treatment and able to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of a decision or lack of decision.<br>
(2) A person may be capable with respect to some treatments and incapable with respect to others.<br>
(3) A person may be incapable with respect to a treatment at one time and capable at another.
</blockquote>
<dd>2.  <i>Applications for the Criminal Defence Lawyer</i><br>
These provisions are reflective of the idea that capacity is relative to the particular decision that the person is called on to make. The test is formulated in a manner that reflects the concern about &quot;cognitive capacity&quot; in
the principle of autonomy: in order to make decisions about treatment, the individual must be able to understand the relevant factors, and the consequences of making, or not making, the decision. This definition of capacity is interesting, because the standard is higher than that imposed in the fitness context. Compare the wording of the capacity test, which asks whether the person is &quot;able to understand the information that is relevant to making the decision&quot; and &quot;able to appreciate the reasonable consequences of a decision or lack of decision,&quot; with the wording of the fitness test, which asks whether the accused is unable to &quot;conduct a defence . . . or to instruct counsel to do so, and, in particular . . . to understand the nature or object of the proceedings,&quot; &quot;understand the possible consequences of the proceedings,&quot; or &quot;communicate with counsel.&quot;  The mentally ill accused is not required to be capable of understanding &quot;information that is relevant to making the decision&quot; or decisions that have to be made in the course of a criminal proceeding, and he is not required to be able to &quot;appreciate the reasonable consequences of a decision or lack of decision&quot; in the course of a criminal proceeding.<sup><a href="#forty9">49</a></sup> He is not even required to have the capacity to understand counsel's advice. Rather, the accused is required to understand the court's function, and the possible outcome of the court proceedings, but not the consequences of decisions that he will be called upon to make. It seems anomalous that a mentally ill person is required to meet a higher standard of
capability for a decision about treatment than is necessary for participation in the criminal process. Moreover, the Ontario Court of Appeal, in the <cite>Taylor</cite> decision (which will be discussed in more detail in II.E below), has given the fitness provisions (and particularly the &quot;communicate with counsel&quot; branch of the test) a narrow interpretation, excluding the possibility of interpreting the test to require that the accused have the &quot;analytic capacity&quot; to evaluate whether a particular decision will be to his benefit. While &quot;capacity <i>to</i>&quot; make specific decisions has gained prominence in the civil context, the criminal law (at least with regard to a finding of fitness) seems to have retained the concept of &quot;global incapacity&quot; or &quot;global
capacity&quot;: the accused's understanding of the court process is used as a kind of global proxy for the mental capacities necessary to stand trial. The result is that after a finding of fitness the mentally ill accused is accorded the
responsibility of making the decisions that arise in the course of a defence, despite the fact that there has been no test to measure his ability to make such important decisions.
<p>
However, it may still be possible for the criminal defence lawyer to make use of these civil provisions for guidance in decision-making prior to a fitness hearing. If the lawyer needs to decide whether to arrange a psychiatric assessment for the client but is unsure about the client's capacity to make the decision, it would seem more sensible for the lawyer to inquire into whether the client is &quot;able to understand the information that is relevant to making a decision concerning the [assessment] and able to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of a decision or lack of decision&quot; than to apply the fitness criteria. The use of a test such as that set out in s. 6 would seem to protect the distinction between the client's <i>capacity</i> to make a particular decision and his <i>consent</i> (or lack of consent) to a particular option. A test such as this would also strike a balance between autonomy and paternalistic interests: if the client is incapable of making the decision, the lawyer may be justified on paternalistic grounds in making the decision for him (on his behalf), but if the client is capable of making the decision, then he should be permitted to make the decision for himself.
<p>
(b) <i>Criteria for Informed Consent</i><br>
<dd>1. <i>Definitions</i><br>
Once it has been determined that the individual is capable of making a treatment decision, the inquiry then turns to
the question of what information is necessary in order for his consent to be valid. The <cite>Mental Health Act</cite> states merely that &quot;[p]sychiatric and other related medical treatment shall not be given to a patient . . . where the patient is mentally competent, without the voluntary, informed consent of the patient.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty">50</a></sup> <cite>Hopp v. Lepp</cite> and <cite>Reibl v. Hughes</cite> could be used to give content to this provision<sup><a href="#fifty1">51</a></sup> in so far as they address the physician's obligations to disclose relevant facts and risks (see B., above).
<p>
By contrast, s. 5 of the <cite>Consent to Treatment Act</cite> explicitly sets out the &quot;elements required for consent to treatment&quot;:
<blockquote><dl>
<dd>1. The consent must relate to the treatment.
<dd>2. The consent must be informed.
<dd>3. The consent must be given voluntarily.
<dd>4. The consent must not have been obtained through misrepresentation or fraud.
<p>
<dt>(2) A consent is informed if, before giving it,
<dd>(a) the person received the information about the treatment, alternative courses of action, the material effects, risks and side effects in each case and the consequences of not having the treatment that a reasonable person in the same circumstances would require in order to make a decision; and
<dd>(b) the health practitioner responded to the person's requests for other information about the treatment, alternative courses of action, material effects, risks and side effects, and consequences of not having the
treatment.
</dl></blockquote>
Further, the consent may be express or implied, as long as it conforms with the above provisions,<sup><a href="#fifty2">52</a></sup> and a consent that has been given may be withdrawn at any time.<sup><a href="#fifty3">53</a></sup>
<p>
<dd>2. Applications for the Criminal Defence Lawyer</i><br>
The above provisions define &quot;informed consent&quot; and also address other issues that could compromise
the validity of consent, such as misrepresentation or coercion. The protection afforded by this legislation is more explicit (and perhaps slightly more expansive) than the common law entitlements described in <cite>Reibl v. Hughes</cite> and <cite>Hopp v. Lepp</cite>. The relevance of these provisions for the criminal defence lawyer is that they serve as a reminder that mentally ill persons should be given detailed information about what counsel is proposing to do, and what the client's options are in the conduct of the defence; the fact that the individual suffers from a mental illness should not disentitle him from receiving the information he needs in order to make &quot;informed&quot; decisions. In fact, the mentally ill client may require more information than the  &quot;ordinary client,&quot; and this information may need to be explained more carefully and clearly than would otherwise be required. Further, given that the fitness test does not specifically address decision-making capacity, there may be a particular need for the lawyer to take the time to explain the client's options and even to repeat the same information on several occasions, to try to ensure that the client actually understands the choices open to him and the possible consequences of those choices. The lawyer should expect that the mentally ill client will require more patience and more assistance than the average &quot;ordinary&quot; client, and it would be reasonable for the lawyer to take this into account when deciding whether or not she is able to represent the client.
<p>
(c)  <i>Alternate Decision-Making</i><br>
<dd>1. <i>Definitions</i><br>
If an individual is adjudged incapable of making the decision to accept or reject treatment, then someone else must make the decision for the incapable person. The question is: &quot;On the basis of which criteria should the decision be made?&quot;  This question returns us to the controversy between the &quot;best interests&quot; test and the &quot;substitute judgment&quot; test, as articulated in the biomedical principles and as critiqued in the <cite>Eve</cite> decision. The difficulty is that the incapable person is, by definition, incapable of making the decision, yet he must bear the consequences of another person's decision. The alternate decision maker must not be given &quot;carte blanche,&quot; lest she make a decision that will be harmful to the incapable person; but at the same time, to require that she do only &quot;what the incapable person would want done&quot; is a test that is impossible to apply, because it is not possible to know what the incapable person actually wants.
<p>
The <cite>Mental Health Act</cite> requires the alternate decision maker to consider four factors in order to determine whether the treatment is in the &quot;best interests&quot; of the patient:
<blockquote>
(a) whether the mental condition of the patient will be or is likely to be substantially improved by the specified psychiatric treatment;<br>
(b) whether the mental condition of the patient will improve or is likely to improve without the specified psychiatric treatment;<br>
(c) whether the anticipated benefit from the specified psychiatric treatment and other related medical treatment outweighs the risk of harm to the patient; and<br>
(d) whether the specified psychiatric treatment is the least restrictive and least intrusive treatment that meets the requirements of clauses (a), (b) and (c).
</blockquote>
The alternate decision maker must also give or refuse consent &quot;in accordance with the wishes of the patient if the person knows that the patient expressed any such wishes when apparently mentally competent and in accordance with the best interests of the patient if the person does not know of any such wishes.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty4">54</a></sup>
<p>
The <cite>Consent to Treatment Act</cite> provides a more specific set of guidelines. These are, in part:
<blockquote>
<dd>12(1) A person may, while capable, express wishes with respect to treatment.
<p>
<dd>(3) Later wishes expressed while capable prevail over earlier wishes.
<p>
<dd>13(1) A person who gives or refuses consent on an incapable person's behalf shall do so in accordance with the following principles:
<ol>
<li>If the person knows of a wish applicable to the circumstances that the incapable person expressed while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, the person shall give or refuse consent in accordance with the wish.
<p>
<li>If the person does not know of a wish applicable to the circumstances that the incapable person expressed while capable and after attaining sixteen years of age, the person shall act in the incapable person's <i>best interests</i> [emphasis added].
</ol>
<dd>(2) In deciding what an incapable person's best interests are, the person who gives or refuses consent
on his or her behalf shall take into consideration,
<blockquote>
(a) the values and beliefs that the person knows the incapable person held when capable and believes he or she would still act on if capable;
<p>
(b) any wishes expressed by the incapable person with respect to the treatment that are not required to be followed under paragraph 1 of subsection (1); and
<p>
(c) the following factors:
<ol>
<li>Whether the incapable person's condition or well-being is likely to be improved by the treatment.
<p>
<li>Whether the person's condition or well-being is likely to improve without the treatment.
<p>
<li>Whether the benefit the person is expected to obtain from the treatment outweighs the risk of harm to him or her.
<p><li>Whether a less restrictive or less intrusive treatment would be as beneficial as the treatment that is proposed.
</ol></blockquote></blockquote>
Section 31 authorizes the Board to override the express wish of the incapable person in certain circumstances. In particular, the Board may do so &quot;if it is satisfied that the incapable person would probably, if capable, give consent because the likely result of the treatment is significantly better than would have been anticipated in comparable circumstances at the time the wish was expressed.&quot;<sup><a href="#fifty5">55</a></sup> The test in the <cite>Substitute Decisions Act</cite> for &quot;guardians of the person&quot; and &quot;attorneys for personal care&quot; who are charged with making decisions for the incompetent person is somewhat different, and warrants reproduction:
<blockquote>
<dd>66(3) The guardian shall make decisions on the incapable person's behalf in accordance with the following principles:
<ol>
<li>If the guardian knows of a wish or instruction applicable to the circumstances that the incapable person
expressed while capable, the guardian shall make the decision in accordance with the wish or instruction.
<p>
<li>The guardian shall use reasonable diligence in ascertaining whether there are such wishes or instructions.
<p>
<li>A later wish or instruction expressed while capable prevails over an earlier wish or instruction.
<p>
<li>If the guardian does not know of a wish or instruction applicable to the circumstances that the incapable person
expressed while capable, or if it is impossible to make the decision in accordance with the wish or instruction, the guardian shall make the decision in the incapable person's <i>best interests</i> [emphasis added].
</ol>
(4) In deciding what the person's best interests are, the guardian shall take into consideration,
<blockquote>
(a) the values and beliefs that the guardian knows the person held when capable and believes the person would still act on if capable; and
<p>
(b) the person's current wishes, if they can be ascertained.
</blockquote>
<dd>(5) The guardian shall encourage the person to participate, to the best of his or her abilities, in the guardian's decisions on his or her behalf.
<p>
<dd>(6) The guardian shall seek to foster regular personal contact between the incapable person and supportive family members and friends of the incapable person.
<p>
<dd>(7) The guardian shall consult from time to time with,
<blockquote>
(a) supportive family members and friends of the incapable person who are in regular personal contact with the incapable person; and
<p>
(b) the persons from whom the incapable person receives personal care.
</blockquote>
<dd>(8) The guardian shall, as far as possible, seek to foster the person's independence.
<p>
<dd>(9) The guardian shall choose the least restrictive and intrusive course of action that is available and
appropriate in the particular case.
</blockquote>
The test under the <cite>Mental Health Act</cite> is a &quot;best interests&quot; test: with the exception of the
provision for the respect of a patient's competent &quot;wishes,&quot; the decision is made objectively, and it is made primarily on evaluation of the medical information (that is, the risks and benefits of a particular treatment). By
contrast, the tests in the <cite>Consent to Treatment Act</cite> and the <cite>Substitute Decisions Act</cite> are not pure &quot;best interests&quot; tests (despite the wording of s. 13[2] and s. 66(3)[4], respectively): they are &quot;substitute judgment&quot; tests, with some &quot;objective&quot; elements. In both of the new pieces of legislation, the &quot;values&quot; and &quot;beliefs&quot; of the incapable person, and any current or former wishes that he has expressed, must be taken into consideration. The use of the word &quot;well being,&quot; and the substitution of the word &quot;condition&quot; for the former term &quot;mental condition&quot; in the <cite>Consent to Treatment Act</cite>, indicates a shift away from primarily medical factors. The <cite>Substitute Decisions Act</cite> gives particular attention to &quot;holistic&quot; aspects of the incapable person's care by positively requiring the guardian to encourage the incapable person to participate in decision-making and to consult
with supportive relatives and friends of the incapable person. Both pieces of new legislation reflect a substantially greater emphasis on subjective factors particular to the individual incapable person.
<p>
<dd>2.  <i>Applications for the Criminal Defence Lawyer</i><br>
In situations where the client is incapable of giving instructions, how should the lawyer act? The advantage of a substitute judgment test is that it takes into account factors specific to the individual client, who will bear the consequences of any decision made on his behalf. Moreover, the lawyer may not be in a position to know what is in the &quot;best interests&quot; of the client, particularly at the very beginning of the lawyer-client relationship.  However, this argument should not be taken too far: the lawyer may well be in a better position to know what is in
the client's &quot;best interests&quot; with regard to the criminal process and the defence position in particular.
<p>
This raises another important issue: should the lawyer take into account the client's mental health needs in addition
to his &quot;criminal defence&quot; needs? The argument for taking the client's mental health needs into account is that it would be somewhat inhumane (and perhaps even counter-productive) not to. If the client is incapable of  making the decision to, for example, have an in-patient rather than an out-patient psychiatric assessment, and the lawyer knows that the client has been living on the streets where (due to his mental condition) he has been subject to various threats to physical and mental health, arranging an in-patient assessment would seem to be an appropriate  and humane act. Also, as Paul Chernoff and William Schaffer suggest, the lawyer should consider the likelihood of the client being released on bail: if the client is likely to be held in custody it might be preferable to arrange for an in-patient psychiatric assessment because a psychiatric hospital may provide more comfortable and appropriate accommodation.<sup><a href="#fifty6">56</a></sup>
<p>
The argument against taking the client's mental health needs into account is twofold. First, the lawyer is not in charge of the client's mental health needs. The psychiatrist or the client's family, not the lawyer, is &quot;the client's keeper&quot;; there is a division of roles and responsibilities. Second, if lawyers make decisions for their clients about mental health issues, this may be open to abuse, in the sense that the lawyer could put a process in motion that she will not be able to &quot;see the client through.&quot;  For example, the lawyer might arrange with the Crown to have the charge withdrawn on condition that the lawyer agrees to take the client to a psychiatric hospital for assessment in preparation for certification (involuntary hospitalization).
<p>
There is certainly no easy answer to the question of whether the lawyer should take the client's mental health needs into account when making decisions on his behalf. The answer is neither &quot;always&quot; nor  &quot;never&quot;; what is needed is an approach that is flexible enough to be applied to the various diverse fact
situations that will arise. Despite the judgment in <cite>Eve</cite>, it would seem that the &quot;substitute judgment&quot; test is more likely than the &quot;best interests&quot; test to strike a balance between concerns about the abuse of paternalism and concerns about the futility of respecting autonomy where the client cannot make
autonomous choices. The combination of objective and subjective factors in the &quot;substitute judgment&quot; test seems more likely to achieve a result that is in keeping with the client's own interests and preferences, than would a purportedly objective &quot;best interests&quot; test. As Welch notes,
<blockquote>
[b]est interests is a matter of one person's opinion about what is best. And if treatment decisions are going to be based on someone's value influenced opinion, should it not be the patient's opinion? That is what substituted  judgment is all about.<sup><a href="#fifty7">57</a></sup>
</blockquote>
But in practical terms, what would a &quot;substitute judgment&quot; test require the lawyer to do? The civil legislation requires a careful inquiry into subjective factors particular to the client. But in a consent to treatment context or a personal care context the alternate decision maker is usually a relative of the patient, who is aware of the patient's &quot;values,&quot; &quot;beliefs,&quot; and &quot;wishes,&quot; whereas the lawyer may have met the client very recently, and likely at a time when the client is in a psychotic state. Accordingly, the lawyer would be unlikely to be able to ascertain the &quot;subjective&quot; elements necessary for the &quot;substitute
judgment&quot; test.
<p>
<dd><i>Provisions of the American Bar Association</i><br>
In addressing this issue, it may be helpful to consider the <cite>ABA Model Rules</cite>. The commentary to Rule 1.14, which is entitled &quot;Client under a Disability,&quot; provides in part:
<blockquote>
The normal client-lawyer relationship is based on the assumption that the client, when properly advised and assisted, is capable of making decisions about important matters. When the client is a minor or suffers from a mental disorder or disability, however, maintaining the ordinary client-lawyer relationship may not be possible in all  respects. . . . The fact that a client suffers a disability does not diminish the lawyer's obligation to treat the client with attention and respect. If the person has no guardian or legal representative, the lawyer often must act as de facto guardian. . . . If a legal representative has already been appointed for the client, the lawyer should look to the
representative for decisions on behalf of the client. If a legal representative has not been appointed, the lawyer should see to such an appointment where it would serve the client's best interests.<sup><a href="#fifty8">58</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The <cite>ABA Model Rules</cite> cross-reference to one of the <cite>ABA Ethical Code</cite> provisions:
<blockquote>
Any mental or physical condition of a client that renders him incapable of making a considered judgment on his own behalf casts additional responsibilities upon his lawyer. Where an incompetent is acting through a guardian or other legal representative, a lawyer must look to such representative for those decisions which are normally the prerogative of the client. If a client under a disability has no legal representative, his lawyer may be compelled in court proceedings to make decisions on behalf of the client. If the client is capable of understanding the matter in question or of contributing to the advancement of his interests, regardless of whether he is legally disqualified from performing certain acts, the lawyer should obtain from him all possible aid. If the disability of a client and the lack of legal representative compel the lawyer to make decisions for his client, the lawyer should consider all  circumstances then prevailing and act with care to safeguard and advance the interests of his client. But obviously a lawyer cannot perform any act or make any decision which the law requires his client to perform or make either acting for himself if competent, or by a duly constituted representative if legally incompetent.<sup><a href="#fifty9">59</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Paul Tremblay notes that this latter provision appears to apply to &quot;court proceedings,&quot; and not to other contexts,<sup><a href="#sixty">60</a></sup> and it is also apparent that the provision is more directly
applicable to civil than criminal proceedings.<sup><a href="#sixty1">61</a></sup> However, the concept of
consulting with other legal representatives, health care professionals, family members, or friends in order to more fully &quot;consider all circumstances then prevailing and act with care to safeguard and advance the interests of [the] client&quot; is sound. And although this provision would seem to imply a &quot;best interests&quot; test,<sup><a href="#sixty2">62</a></sup> consultation could enable the lawyer to apply a modified &quot;substitute judgment&quot; test effectively.
<p>
One must, however, contend with the Law Society of Upper Canada's Rule on Confidentiality (Rule 4),<sup><a href="#sixty3">63</a></sup> which requires the lawyer to obtain the client's authorization before disclosing information obtained in the course of the professional relationship. The authorization requirement is explained in Commentary 9, which reads, in part:
<blockquote>
Confidential information may be divulged with the express authority of the client concerned, and, in some situations, <i>the authority of the client to divulge may be implied.</i> For example, some disclosure may be
necessary in a pleading or other document delivered in litigation being conducted for the client. . . . [emphasis added]
</blockquote>
Surely the authorization to divulge minimum information about the client's situation should be implied by the fact of retainer. In order to represent the client competently (LSUC Rule 2), and in order to make an appropriate decision for the client when he is unable to do so, there must be some authorization for the lawyer to gather the information that she needs in order to make the decision.It is not a question of disclosing a &quot;confidence&quot;: it is a question of being able to identify oneself as a lawyer retained by the client, and being able to ask others to provide information for use in making the relevant decision on the client's behalf.
<p>
There is some support for this proposition in an &quot;Informal Opinion&quot; of the American Bar Association (Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility).<sup><a href="#sixty4">64</a></sup> This Opinion dealt with the question of whether a lawyer can discuss a client's medical/psychiatric condition with the client's physician. The circumstances of the particular case were that the lawyer &quot;reasonably believe[d]&quot; that the client had abused prescription medication, which had resulted in an inability to communicate or reach adequately informed decisions. In this case, the client &quot;previously neither authorized nor expressly prohibited&quot; the lawyer from contacting the physician, and &quot;the lawyer believes that the client, who now refuses to discuss the matter, is not presently capable of giving a valid consent.&quot;  The Committee read ABA Model Rule 1.6, which forbids the lawyer to &quot;reveal information relating to the representation of a client unless the client consents after consultation, except for disclosures that are impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation [and except for certain other categories],&quot; <i>in light of</i> Rule 1.14 (as quoted above), noting that the ordinary Rule requiring that consent be given to disclosure &quot;assumes a competent client capable of comprehending and evaluating the relevant considerations.&quot;  The Committee added that when the lawyer is called upon to act as &quot;de facto guardian for the client,&quot; the authority to act in that role &quot;cannot depend upon the consent of the client whose very disability makes [the disclosures] necessary and who is not capable of giving a valid consent.&quot;  The Committee emphasized that &quot;if the lawyer could take no action to protect a disabled client because doing so would require an unauthorized disclosure of information relating to the representation, irreparable harm to the client's interests might well result,&quot; because the client might do nothing (&quot;thereby abandoning valuable rights&quot;) or might &quot;insist that the lawyer take action undermining the client's interests.&quot; This would leave the lawyer with the &quot;unacceptable choice of either standing by helplessly while the client suffers the consequent harm or withdrawing from the representation . . . leaving the client without representation at the time it is most needed.&quot;  Accordingly the Committee decided that <i>the lawyer's authority to disclose &quot;information relating to the representation to the extent necessary to serve the best interests of the client reasonably believed to be disabled&quot; should be considered to be  &quot;impliedly authorized within the meaning of Model Rule 1.6.&quot;</i> Rule 4 of the LSUC rules is similar to the ABA Model Rule 1.6, and it is submitted that the term &quot;impliedly authorized&quot; in LSUC Rule 4
should be interpreted in the same way that the ABA Committee interpreted its American counterpart.
<p>
In Ontario, however, civil mental health laws render the question of disclosure more complex. For example, in order for a psychiatrist to disclose a patient's clinical record or to discuss the patient's case, the patient must sign a Form 14 (consent to disclose) under the <cite>Mental Health Act</cite>. In order to sign this form, the patient must be
&quot;competent&quot; to do so, and if the client may be incompetent for this purpose, application may need to be made to the Mental Health Review Board to have his competency evaluated.<sup><a href="#sixty5">65</a></sup> A simpler route is to contact the patient's guardian. If the client has an appointed representative (either a &quot;committee of the person&quot; under the <cite>Mental Incompetency Act</cite> or a representative for the purpose of consent to treatment under the <cite>Mental Health Act</cite>), that person is able to consent to the disclosure of the clinical record on the patient's behalf.<sup><a href="#sixty6">66</a></sup>
<p>
Surely it would not be argued that the lawyer had breached LSUC Rule 4 if she contacted the client's representative in order to obtain the client's clinical record: this is a common practice, and indeed, for the lawyer who is representing an incompetent client, there is no real alternative. If the ABA Committee's interpretation of implied authorization---that the lawyer is authorized to disclose &quot;information relating to the representation to the extent necessary to serve the best interests of the client reasonably believed to be disabled&quot;---were applied to LSUC Rule 4, it would seem that the lawyer would also be permitted to contact other persons (that is, persons other than the treating physician) in order to gather information &quot;necessary to serve the best interests of the [disabled] client.&quot;  It should be permissible to contact family members and friends of the client, and other persons who have been in close contact with him, for the purpose of obtaining information that would help the lawyer make a necessary decision on behalf of a client who is incapable of making that decision himself, because the alternative, as the ABA Committee rightly noted, is to permit the client to sacrifice or sabotage his own interests because he is incapable of making the relevant decisions. Consultation with others in order to protect the incapacitated client's interests is much more consistent with the lawyer's professional responsibility as the client's legal representative.
<p>
When consulting with others the lawyer should, of course, disclose as little of the information that is in her own possession as possible: probably a simple statement that she has been retained to act on behalf of the mentally ill client in a criminal matter would be sufficient. She also should carefully evaluate and weigh the information
gathered from others against any &quot;wishes&quot; expressed by the incapable client (while competent, or even while incompetent), and against the dictates of her own professional judgment. The &quot;substitute  judgment&quot; must advance the client's interests, and it is the lawyer's responsibility to find an appropriate
middle ground between the extremes of either leaving the incapacitated person to his own devices or unilaterally imposing a &quot;best interests&quot; test that fails to take into account the particularities of the individual client's perspective.
<p>
D. MODELS OF THE DEFENCE LAWYER
<p>
Five possible approaches for defence counsel to adopt when defending the mentally ill client are discussed below. They are derived from discussions with members of the criminal bar (Crown and defence), and from perspectives
expressed in the literature on advocacy in the civil commitment context.<sup><a href="#sixty7">67</a></sup> Although these models are identified as distinct perspectives, it is possible and common for individual lawyers to combine aspects of several models in practice.
<p>
<i>Model 1: The Lawyer as Cab Driver</i><br>
In this model, the role of the lawyer is to follow the client's instructions, whatever those instructions may be, and however odd or detrimental to the client's case they may seem. This is a &quot;hard autonomy&quot; position: the fundamental value is respect for the client's choices, and the lawyer's role in this process is to advise, but ultimately to act in accordance with the client's wishes, assuming that these instructions do not require the lawyer to violate the relevant professional conduct rules. The mental illness or incompetence of the client does not affect the lawyer's role: in the words of Natalie Wolf (writing in the civil context),
<blockquote>
[i]t is possible that the client is, in fact, mentally ill, and thus incapable of making a competent decision. The attorney should nonetheless act upon the <i>expressed</i> desires of the client, just as she would in any other
representation.<sup><a href="#sixty8">68</a></sup> 
</blockquote>
This position implies a particular view of the duties implied by a retainer: the assumption is that the client is hiring the lawyer to be his &quot;mouthpiece&quot; or &quot;spokesperson,&quot; to put forward his position in the case. It would be paternalistic and unjustifiable for the lawyer to &quot;take over&quot; the case by imposing her own view of how the defence ought to be conducted. Such actions on the lawyer's part would vitiate the very heart of the retainer, and the lawyer would no longer be &quot;representing&quot; the client before the court.
<p>
The &quot;cab driver&quot; model implies that the client, as the employer of the lawyer, is entitled to direct the lawyer (as he would a cab driver) at any point, as long as the lawyer remains within the outer ethical boundaries that
constitute the &quot;rules of the road.&quot; The chief difficulty with this model is that it confuses questions of capacity with questions of consent: if we cannot be certain that the client has the capacity to make decisions on his own behalf, how can we be confident that the &quot;consent&quot; or directions that he gives are actually autonomous choices? Why should deference be accorded to psychotic or delusional preferences?<sup><a href="#sixty9">69</a></sup>
<p>
The &quot;hard autonomy&quot; argument is considerably stronger after a finding of fitness to stand trial has been made. If the mentally ill client has been found fit to stand trial, his position before the court is the same as that of an &quot;ordinary&quot; criminal defendant, and if other defendants have the authority to instruct counsel to adopt certain measures or strategies, then an argument could be made that the mentally ill client should be able to instruct
counsel in the same manner.
<p>
<i>Model 2: The Lawyer as Adversary (a &quot;hard adversary&quot; position)</i><br>
This model places emphasis on the fact that the defence lawyer is charged with defending the client against the
machinations of the state, as expressed through the Crown. The &quot;default position&quot; of the criminal defence lawyer (in the absence of instructions from the client) should always be to oppose the position that the Crown is advancing.  To accede to (for example) a finding of unfitness by making few or no submissions, even in a &quot;hopeless&quot; case, would be to abdicate the responsibility to defend the client's interests; it would be tantamount to siding with the state against the accused. Rand Jack and Dana Crowley Jack identify two rationales for the &quot;hard adversary&quot; position: first, &quot;the [hard adversary] role and the system are so intertwined that . . . the fair, effective functioning of the legal system&quot; is dependent on the adoption of this
stance; and second, &quot;untempered advocacy&quot; is the prime way to &quot;provid[e] for the personal freedom, autonomy and dignity of the client&quot; in the legal process.<sup><a href="#seventy">70</a></sup>      
<p>
Regardless of the lawyer's own personal views about the client's &quot;best interests&quot; or mental health needs, the lawyer should always vigorously defend the client against the position of the Crown. She should do so even if this would (objectively) cause greater harm to the client's mental or physical condition (for example, by requiring the client to remain in court through lengthy cross-examination when the client is obviously becoming more agitated as the proceedings wear on; or by permitting the client to remain in custody for a longer period of time because the lawyer is insisting that a particular witness or witnesses be called at the fitness hearing).
<p>
The strength of this model is that it clearly identifies the fact that the defence lawyer, by definition, is charged with defending the client.<sup><a href="#seventy1">71</a></sup> The incapacitated client may be unable to evaluate his lawyer's conduct in the way that an &quot;ordinary&quot; client could, and the lawyer for a mentally ill client accordingly has a greater responsibility to remember that she is the only &quot;player&quot; who is solely responsible for defending the accused.
<p>
The weakness of this model is that it cannot unequivocally be stated that the lawyer's <i>professional</i> responsibility is to prevent a finding of unfitness: the lawyer is required to &quot;protect the client as far as possible
<i>from being convicted</i> except by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction and upon legal evidence sufficient to support a conviction for the offence with which the client is charged,&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy2">72</a></sup> but this does not create a duty to protect the client from a finding of unfitness. In fact, a finding of unfitness will protect the client from being convicted, in the sense that it will delay the trial, and could possibly delay it to the point where the Crown can no longer produce sufficient evidence to warrant putting the accused on trial.<sup><a href="#seventy3">73</a></sup>
<p>
Further, Commentary 2 to LSUC Rule 10, which would at first appear to support this model, is in actuality quite ambiguous. It reads, &quot;[t]he lawyer has a duty to the client to raise fearlessly every issue, advance every argument, and ask every question, however distasteful, which the lawyer thinks <i>will help the client's case</i> and to endeavour to <i>obtain for the client the benefit of every remedy and defence</i> authorized by law.&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy4">74</a></sup> Although a finding of unfitness is not a &quot;remedy&quot; or &quot;defence,&quot; it is intended to be a protection for the incapacitated accused. Should the lawyer in this &quot;adversary model&quot; strongly oppose, or advocate, a finding of unfitness simply because the Crown has, or has not, raised it?
<p>
Surely it would be wrong to subordinate the client's interests to the adversary process by making the defence strategy contingent on the course that the Crown decides to take. It would be wrong for the lawyer either to defend rigorously a &quot;hopeless&quot; cause (where the accused is obviously extremely ill and unfit) or to &quot;throw&quot; the fitness hearing by not cross-examining or by making &quot;no submissions&quot; (regardless of how ill the client is). It is submitted that the lawyer should fulfil her responsibility as an &quot;adversary&quot; to the Crown by testing the evidence given by Crown witnesses and by calling defence witnesses if this would in fact &quot;help the client's case.&quot;  The defence lawyer's duty is to protect her client's interests and not to oppose blindly whatever position the Crown adopts.
<P>
<i>Model 3: The &quot;Man is Born Free&quot; Model</i><br>
This model is similar to the &quot;hard adversary&quot; model in that it also establishes a &quot;default rule.&quot;  The default rule in this model is that the defence lawyer should always try to obtain the disposition that will place the most minimal constraints on the client's physical liberty. In the absence of instructions to the contrary, and regardless of the client's physical or mental state, the defence lawyer should argue for the alternative that will provide the client with the greatest possible degree of freedom from constraint. The strength of this argument is that it draws attention to the fact that the client must live with the disposition that the lawyer arranges on his behalf: if the lawyer were to make no submissions as to the placement of the client after a finding of unfitness, or were to make a submission for hospitalization, and the court or OCCRB decided on hospitalization, it would be the client, not the lawyer, who would be required to accept the consequences.
<p>
However, this model is subject to some of the same criticisms made of the &quot;hard adversary&quot; model, namely, that there is no specific justification in the Rules of Professional Conduct for seeking the most minimal restraints on liberty (see the Rules cited in Model 2, above). Further, this model gives no consideration to the client's &quot;mental&quot; or &quot;emotional&quot; liberty: the distress of mind that can flow from a mental disorder such as paranoid schizophrenia is extreme, and liberty of bodily movement when one's liberty of mind and emotion are severely compromised is a hollow victory.
<p>
Surely attempting to protect the client from conviction, or attempting to ensure the most favourable disposition after
conviction, is fundamentally different from the situation when the accused has been found unfit to stand trial. If the lawyer is concerned with protecting the client's interests and &quot;help[ing] the client's case,&quot; she should consider the means that will advance the client's prospects of becoming fit in as short a period of time as possible. The exception would be a situation where the charge is likely to be withdrawn within a short period of time, perhaps because the Crown's case has weakened or soon will weaken significantly.<sup><a href="#seventy5">75</a></sup> If the charge is serious, it might actually be a better protection for the client's interests to endeavour to make an agreement with the Crown to withdraw the charge in exchange for an initial period of severe constraints on liberty, such as certification under the <cite>Mental Health Act</cite>. The client's
prospects of, for example, rehabilitation and release into the community might be better under the <cite>Mental Health Act</cite> than they would be if the unfit client were placed in hospital until he became fit and then returned to court to face (assuming conviction) either a lengthy period of incarceration or potentially another period of time in a mental hospital (if the NCR defence were to be raised).
<p>
In sum, the defence lawyer should not subject the client's interests and the advancement of the client's case to a short-sighted view of the merits of &quot;minimal restraints on liberty.&quot;  While the lawyer must take into account the disadvantages of confinement or other restraints, she must remember that &quot;minimal restraints&quot; is not an accurate proxy for &quot;helping the client's case.&quot;
<p>
<i>Model 4: The Agnostic or &quot;Case by Case&quot; Model</i><br>
This model holds that each client's case is unique and must be handled according to the circumstances of the particular situation. If the lawyer were, for example, to adopt any of the above three models, there would always be
certain clients who would be harmed rather than helped by that particular approach. Instead, the lawyer should be sensitive to the needs of the individual client, and should adapt to each situation as it arises.
<p>
The strength of this approach is its flexibility; the model adapts to the individual client's interests and the advancement of his case. However, this approach relies heavily on the individual lawyer's own judgment, and as such it is just as likely as the other models to generate unfair results <i>across a group</i> of clients. The lawyer who relies heavily upon her own judgment is essentially applying a &quot;best interests&quot; test: just as the other models assume that it is in the client's best interests to (1) entirely control the defence, (2) always oppose the Crown, or (3) be subject to the least amount of physical restraint possible, this model assumes that the lawyer is <i>able</i> to determine, in each case, what ought to be done for the particular client. Clients who are similarly situated (with regard to their legal position and mental condition) might be treated differently by the lawyer who is attempting to design her role &quot;from scratch&quot; for each client. Moreover, if several defence lawyers used this model, the same client could be treated very differently depending on which lawyer he retained.
<p>
Surely it would be preferable for the lawyer to have an understanding of her role <i>as defence counsel for mentally ill clients</i>. This role should be stable: a principled understanding of the lawyer's role would enable the exercise of that role to be adapted to the particular needs of the individual client, but the role itself would not need to be recreated for each new individual client.
<p>
<i>Model 5: The Lawyer as Substitute Decision Maker and Advocate</i><br>
This model is the author's preference. In this approach, the lawyer's role would be to act as a substitute decision
maker for the incapacitated client, and as an advocate <i>for</i> and <i>with</i> the fit, though mentally ill, client. What do the terms &quot;substitute decision maker&quot; and &quot;advocate&quot; mean? Since this model will form the basis for the &quot;Guiding Principles&quot; (to be described in Section III, below), it will be outlined in general terms here, subject to qualifications and nuances that will be added in the &quot;Principles&quot; section below.
<p>
The &quot;substitute decision maker&quot; and &quot;advocate&quot; roles should be understood as two parts of one broader role. The lawyer would consider herself as responsible for the mentally ill client. The responsibility would be centred upon the client's legal situation, and the client's mental and physical state would be within the
purview of the lawyer's responsibility to the extent that these states influence or interact with the client's legal situation. The lawyer's responsibility would be based upon the fact that the mentally ill client, by virtue of his
mental disorder, and regardless of his fitness, is in a more vulnerable position relative to the legal process than is the average &quot;ordinary&quot; client. Particularly, the client may have difficulty identifying and communicating his
preferences to the lawyer, and may have difficulty evaluating and processing the lawyer's advice. This situation is reducible to difficulties in decision-making---both in terms of the <i>capacity</i> to make decisions, and in terms of the ability to <i>decide</i> (&quot;consent&quot;). The lawyer's responsibility to the mentally ill client is to make decisions on his behalf if he is incapable of making decisions, and to contribute particular energy to &quot;advocating&quot; (in the sense of providing information and discussing) with him with regard to decisions that he is capable of making. As Bonnie explains (in the context of acting for mentally retarded clients), &quot;the fairness of adjudication . . . depends largely on the ability and inclination of the <i>attorney</i> to recognize and to compensate for the client's limitations . . . enhanced competence of attorneys is necessary to assure adequate representation of marginally competent clients.&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy6">76</a></sup>
<p>
The lawyer should gather information from others in order to assess the client's capacity if the lawyer feels unable to assess the client herself. (Note that in the civil context, the Weisstub Enquiry suggested that it is the lawyer's &quot;duty&quot; to &quot;have the individual properly assessed&quot; where capacity is in doubt.)<sup><a href="#seventy7">77</a></sup> A professional assessment dealing with matters other than capability would also enable the lawyer to make appropriate decisions on the client's behalf (that is, substitute judgment) if this is necessary. The lawyer should advocate for the client with others in the civil mental health system and the Crown or court in the criminal system in order to obtain the disposition that will advance the client's interests and help the client's case.
<p>
In negotiating with professionals in the civil mental health system, and in negotiating with care givers more generally, the lawyer should heed the concerns expressed in the Report of the Review of Advocacy for Vulnerable Adults: the Committee noted that in the civil context,
<blockquote>
. . . advocacy should not be primarily adversarial in nature. Indeed, little is to be gained through an overzealous and abrasive approach and the costs can be high: overt or covert sanctions against [the client]; stress; undue expenditures of time and money; increased resistance to subsequent requests; and alienation of those upon whom the vulnerable person must rely.<sup><a href="#seventy8">78</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The Committee's remarks were made in the context of lay advocates, but this particular quotation applies also to the
lawyer. The lawyer must consider how to protect the client's interests, and should not antagonize the persons on whom the client is, or will be, dependent, lest those persons covertly or overtly &quot;take out&quot; their frustrations on the vulnerable client.
<p>
The lawyer is not a &quot;mouthpiece,&quot; and neither is she expected to always oppose the Crown, always favour maximum physical liberty, or redefine her position anew for every client. Rather, with each client, she will begin by assessing his capability to make the decisions that need to be made first (in the way that some lawyers might put their new clients through a fitness test) and if the client is not capable of making particular decisions, she will consult with those who are able to provide information about the client's preferences so that she will be able to make an appropriate decision on the client's behalf. What the client can contribute should also be taken into account, and the lawyer should encourage the client to participate in the decision to the best of his ability. The more capable the client is of making decisions with regard to his case, the more the lawyer will adopt the advocate approach; the less capable the client is of making given decisions, the more the lawyer will rely on the substitute judgment approach. The decisions made by the lawyer must advance the client's interests and help his case. These decisions
should not be made for the benefit of any other person; other persons are to be used only as sources of information about the client.
<p>
When the client is adjudged capable of making given decisions (that is, when the court finds the client fit), the lawyer should then advocate with the client to help him to understand the options available to him, and should negotiate with him to help him to identify what his interests are and which choices could advance his case.  This would be the criminal law equivalent of the directive in the <cite>Advocacy Act</cite> (for lay advocates), which requires advocates to &quot;help individual vulnerable persons express and act on their wishes, ascertain and exercise their rights, [and] speak on their own behalf.&quot;<sup><a href="#seventy9">79</a></sup> The lawyer must follow the instructions that the fit client ultimately gives. (This responsibility has been set out in certain recent
judgments, which will be explained below). Throughout, the lawyer should always endeavour to ensure that the client's decisions are voluntarily given and as fully informed as possible.<sup><a href="#eighty">80</a></sup>
<p>
E. RECENT CANADIAN CASES GOVERNING FITNESS, THE NOT CRIMINALLY RESPONSIBLE DEFENCE, AND THE ROLE OF DEFENCE COUNSEL
<p>
It was noted in Section I, above, that provisions of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> and related case law ought to
&quot;illustrate and clarify, rather than support, explain and justify, the lawyer's professional responsibilities,&quot; because &quot;the lawyer's decisions should be derived from principled standards and applied within the context of particular legislative structures.&quot;  The following three cases, <cite>Taylor</cite>, <cite>Brigham</cite>, and <cite>Swain</cite>, explain the legal structures within which ethical principles operate. These cases have established the current substantive law in the area of fitness to stand trial and the NCR defence, and ethical guidelines cannot directly contradict the law.
<p>
(a) <cite>Swain</cite><br>
<cite>Swain</cite> was decided under the former legislation whereby a person found not guilty by reason of insanity was automatically placed on a Warrant of the Lieutenant Governor and was held (at least initially) in the custody of a mental hospital. Lamer J. (as he then was), for the majority, held that the Crown could not raise the issue of insanity unless the accused had put his mental state in issue or unless the trier of fact had concluded that the accused was otherwise (that is, in the absence of an &quot;insanity defence&quot;) guilty of the offence charged. In arriving at this decision, Lamer J. placed considerable emphasis on his view of the accused's role in the criminal process. The following section of the judgment is particularly important:
<blockquote>
Given that the principles of fundamental justice contemplate an accusatorial and adversarial system of criminal justice which is founded on respect for the autonomy and dignity of human beings, it seems clear to me that the principles of fundamental justice must also require that an accused person have the right to control his or her own defence. The appellant has properly pointed out that an accused will not be in the position of choosing whether to raise the defence of insanity at his or her trial unless he or she is fit to stand trial. If at any time before verdict there is a question as to the accused's ability to conduct his or her defence, the trial judge may direct that the issue of fitness to stand trial be tried before matters proceed further: see <cite>Criminal Code</cite>, s. 543, now s. 615 [repealed in 1991]. Thus, an accused who has not been found unfit to stand trial must be considered capable of conducting his or her own defence.
<p>
An accused person has control over the decision of whether to have counsel, whether to testify on his or her own behalf, and what witnesses to call. This is a reflection of our society's traditional respect for individual autonomy within an adversarial system. . . . In my view, the decision whether or not to raise this exemption [the insanity defence] as a means of negating criminal culpability is part and parcel of the conduct of an accused's over-all defence.<sup><a href="#eighty1">81</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The first issue is whether Lamer J. is addressing the right of the accused herself (personally) to make decisions about the conduct of the defence, or whether he is referring to the right of the accused and counsel for the accused to make such decisions (in the sense that judges mean when they write &quot;the accused has argued before this court . . . &quot; or &quot;the position of the appellant is . . .&quot;). Lamer J.'s reference to &quot;respect for the
autonomy and dignity of human beings&quot; and the &quot;accused <i>person</i>&quot; in connection with decisions such as retaining counsel, testifying, and calling witnesses, would suggest that he was indeed referring to the accused personally. Lamer J.'s reference to the fitness test immediately prior to his discussion of the accused's control over various aspects of the defence would also indicate that he believes that a fit accused should have the same decision-making authority as an &quot;ordinary&quot; accused. The adequacy of the fitness test as a threshold for participation in the criminal process was not at issue.
<p>
(b) <cite>Taylor</cite><br>
<cite>Taylor</cite> took Lamer J.'s analysis further by using it to interpret the newly-codified fitness test. This case is very significant, and because it will be referred to at several points in the subsequent discussion, the facts will be described in some detail at this juncture. All of the facts and quotations described below are taken from the Court of Appeal judgment.
<p>
Dwight Taylor is a lawyer who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. He was suspended by the Law Society of  Upper Canada on the grounds that, due to his mental disorder, he was unfit to practice law. Taylor applied to be reinstated, and was examined by a psychiatrist chosen by the Law Society, who concluded that  Taylor was incapable of practising law. After Taylor was served with a copy of this report, he went to Osgoode Hall to see a  Conway, who was acting as counsel for the Law Society in his case, and allegedly stabbed him.  Taylor was initially found not guilty by reason of insanity (in 1988) after the Crown led evidence of insanity, but after the <cite>Swain</cite> decision a new trial was ordered. In March 1992 the trial judge appointed counsel for Taylor, but he &quot;repudiated counsel as an incompetent fraud and did not cooperate with him.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty2">82</a></sup> Counsel appointed by the trial court advised the court that &quot;it was not necessary or appropriate for the [accused] to testify on the fitness hearing,&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty3">83</a></sup> but  Taylor chose to testify. He was found unfit to stand trial and returned to hospital pending the OCCRB review. The OCCRB also found him unfit and ordered that he be detained in hospital (at the Oak Ridge division of the Regional Mental Health Centre in Penetanguishene).
<p>
Taylor appealed the finding of unfitness to the Court of Appeal, and argued his case himself. Lacourciere J.A., for the Court, stated that &quot;[h]is submissions did not assist the court in any way.&quot;<sup><a href="#eighty4">84</a></sup> When the Court, because of &quot;time exigencies,&quot; attempted to limit the (already extended) period of time that Taylor was taking to make his submissions, he left the court and refused to return for the remainder of the appeal.<sup><a href="#eighty5">85</a></sup> An <i>amicus curiae</i>, who was appointed by the Court of Appeal, made submissions on the issues before the Court. The appeal succeeded, in part on the ground that the trial judge erred in not satisfying himself that the Crown was in a position to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case (<i>i.e.</i>, that the accused &quot;committed the act or acts alleged in the indictment&quot;)<sup><a href="#eighty6">86</a></sup> before engaging in a fitness hearing, and in part because of the fitness test that the trial judge applied. The latter issue is important for present purposes.
<p>
The appeal court considered the appropriate test to be applied for the third branch of the fitness provision. Section 2 of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> reads, in part:
<blockquote>
&quot;unfit to stand trial&quot; means unable on account of mental disorder to conduct a defence at any stage of the proceedings before a verdict is rendered or to instruct counsel to do so, and, in particular, unable on account of mental disorder to
<blockquote>
(a)understand the nature or object of the proceedings,
<p>
(b) understand the possible consequences of the proceedings, or
<p>
(c) communicate with counsel;
</blockquote></blockquote>
It was conceded that Taylor understood the nature or object of the proceedings and the possible consequences of the proceedings, but the respondent and the <i>amicus curiae</i> disagreed over the question of Taylor's ability to meet the third criterion. The dispute was about the correct test to be applied to (c). The psychiatric evidence offered at the fitness hearing was to the effect that Taylor should be found unfit because he was unable to communicate with counsel. The following are extracts:
<blockquote>
He believes the hospital, the courts and the witnesses to the courts have routinely conspired against him, have altered or rescinded their testimony or documentation and that the court is withdrawing all charges against him. His delusional system is focused on the judicial system and participants in it
<p>
<center>. . .</center>
<p>
He would be unable to participate meaningfully in the proceedings as his delusional thinking would preclude accurate perception of the events occurring before him.<sup><a href="#eighty7">87</a></sup>
<p>
He cannot be dealt with rationally. He refuses examination by his defence psychiatrist and remains convinced that he is perfectly well and only a victim of conspiracy. It would hardly be surprising if he is uncooperative with the lawyer assigned to represent him and I do not believe by any stretch of the imagination he could effectively represent himself.<sup><a href="#eighty8">88</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Taylor testified that he had in fact spoken with counsel of his choice and was satisfied that he could work with this person. He denied that he believed that lawyers were part of a conspiracy to frame him. On cross-examination he admitted that he had filed several criminal charges against a number of public officials and that he had said that the Crown in his first trial had &quot;maliciously prosecuted&quot; him.<sup><a href="#eighty9">89</a></sup> The trial judge concluded as follows:
<blockquote>
[Taylor] can communicate with counsel to the extent that he can speak to counsel, and do so in an articulate manner, however . . . his delusions are so pervasive and irrational that he is . . . not merely capable of disagreeing with counsel whom he might instruct as to how the case should be conducted, but unable to perceive his own best interests and how those interests should be addressed in the conduct of a trial. . . . I am content that the accused person in this case is not capable to rationally instruct counsel, or rationally conduct a case or rationally communicate with counsel because of this mental disorder.<sup><a href="#ninety">90</a></sup>
</blockquote>
The appeal court referred to two cases (<cite>Reference Re: Gorecki (No. 1)</cite> and <cite>R. v. Trecroce</cite>) which had been decided before the codification of the fitness test, and referred to these as propounding the &quot;limited cognitive capacity&quot; test (as opposed to the &quot;analytic capacity&quot; test, which the trial judge applied). Lacourciere J.A. also adopted the annotation of the editor of <cite>Martin's Annual Criminal Code</cite> which stated that the definition of fitness in s. 2 &quot;entrenches the extensive case-law in the area.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety1">91</a></sup> The &quot;limited cognitive capacity&quot; test, which the court held to be correct, does <i>not</i> require that the accused be capable of acting with good judgment, accurately interpreting the evidence that is given, co-operating with counsel, or making decisions that are in his best interests; rather,
<blockquote>
under this test, a court's assessment of an accused's ability to conduct a defence and to communicate with and instruct counsel is limited to an inquiry into whether an accused can recount to his/her counsel the necessary facts relating to the offence in such a way that counsel can then properly present a defence.<sup><a href="#ninety2">92</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Lacourciere J.A. recognized that the fitness rule is intended to ensure that &quot;the accused . . . have sufficient
mental fitness to participate in the proceedings in a meaningful way,&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety3">93</a></sup> but added that the &quot;principles of fundamental justice&quot; require that the trial come to completion &quot;without undue delay.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety4">94</a></sup>
<p>
Lacourciere J.A. then emphasized Lamer J.'s statement in <cite>Swain</cite> with regard to the inclusion of the accused's right to control his own defence within the s. 7 right to liberty. He held:
</blockquote>
In addition, adopting a high threshold of fitness, including a &quot;best interests&quot; component, derogates from the fundamental principle that an accused is entitled to choose his own defence and to present it as he chooses . . . [reference to <cite>Swain</cite>]. . . . An accused who has not been found unfit to stand trial must be permitted to conduct his own defence, even if this means that the accused may act to his own detriment in doing so. The autonomy of the accused in the adversarial system requires that the accused should be able to make such fundamental decisions and assume the risks involved.<sup><a href="#ninety5">95</a></sup>
</blockquote>
Finally, Lacourciere J.A. held that the &quot;limited cognitive capacity&quot; test &quot;strikes an effective balance between the objectives of the fitness rules and the constitutional right of the accused to choose his own defence and to have a trial within a reasonable time.&quot;<sup><a href="#ninety6">96</a></sup>
<p>
<i>Criticisms of the</i> Taylor <i>Decision</i><br>
The judgment of the Court of Appeal in <cite>Taylor</cite> may be criticised on five grounds. These criticisms relate to the central question of the appropriate threshold for a finding of unfitness.  It was argued in Section I, above, that the threshold for a finding of unfitness is lower than the civil threshold, and it was inferred that it would be preferable for concerned parties to be able to gain access more readily to the civil system, rather than having to invoke the cumbersome machinery and expense of the criminal justice system. However, this does not imply that the criminal threshold is set at an appropriate level, or that it ought to be raised: on the contrary, it is submitted that the threshold for a finding of unfitness, as articulated in <cite>Taylor</cite>, is set too high (that is, persons will be found fit when they ought to be found unfit). The five grounds for criticism of the <cite>Taylor</cite> decision will explain this view.
<p>
The first criticism of <cite>Taylor</cite> is that the Court based its conclusions on an inappropriate method of statutory interpretation. Lacourciere J.A. has effectively split the codified fitness standard into two pieces---the preamble, and the three sub-categories---and deprived the first half of meaning.<sup><a href="#ninety7">97</a></sup> The first part of the standard reads, &quot;`unfit to stand trial' means unable on account of mental disorder to <i>conduct a defence</i> at any stage of the proceedings . . . or <i>to instruct counsel to do so, and, in particular,</i> unable to . . . [the three sub-categories follow]&quot; [emphasis added]. Surely the three sub-categories (understanding of the nature or object of proceedings; understanding of the possible consequences; ability to communicate with counsel) are meant to be illustrations, or examples, of the general principles embodied in the first portion of the test. The Court in <cite>Taylor</cite> appears to have worked backwards: Lacourciere J.A. began with the third sub-category, and then compounded the error by not placing that category into the context of the first part of the section or the section as a whole. If the third sub-category (ability to communicate with counsel) had been read as one illustration of the proposition that the accused must be able to &quot;conduct a defence&quot; or &quot;instruct counsel to do so,&quot; the result in <cite>Taylor</cite> might
have been quite different.  Taylor's ability to conduct a defence was seriously compromised (as his own behaviour at the appellate level demonstrated, and as the evidence accepted by the trial judge revealed), and his ability to &quot;instruct counsel to do so&quot; was suspect (as the evidence before the trial court indicated).
<p>
In <cite>Swain</cite>, Lamer J. justified according the accused the &quot;right&quot; to control his own defence partly on the basis that &quot;if at any time before verdict there is a question as to the accused's ability to conduct his or her defence, the trial judge may direct that the issue of fitness to stand trial be tried before matters proceed further.&quot; Lamer J. clearly assumed that the fitness test would include an evaluation of the accused's ability to <i>conduct a defence</i> (and the drafters of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> standard incorporated the same phrase). If Lacourciere J.A. had interpreted the section as a whole, and had read Lamer J.'s comments in <cite>Swain</cite> in conjunction with the whole, a lower threshold for a finding of unfitness might well have been indicated. The ability to &quot;conduct a defence&quot; would require, at a minimum, the ability to weigh the various options open to an accused in the course of a trial, and might also include the ability to understand and decide whether to act upon counsel's advice (which is surely part of the conduct of a defence): in short, a test of <i>decision-making</i> capacity would have been required.<sup><a href="#ninety8">98</a></sup>
<p>
The second point, which builds upon the first, is that the &quot;limited cognitive capacity&quot; test makes no inquiry into the fundamental question of the accused's capacity to make decisions relevant to his defence. The importance of a pragmatic test has been recognized not only in the civil context (as discussed above), but also in the criminal context in the United States. The ABA, in the commentary to its <cite>Mental Health Standards</cite>, acknowledges that a &quot;determination of competence or incompetence is functional in nature, context-dependent and pragmatic in orientation,&quot; and the ABA's own competence (fitness) test requires evaluation of the &quot;skills&quot; that the accused will need in order to participate effectively in his defence.<sup><a href="#ninety9">99</a></sup> A fitness test which evaluates decision-making capacity would seem to be especially important in Canada because, since <cite>Swain</cite>, the fit accused has a constitutional entitlement to
make many of the important decisions that arise in the course of a defence; an inquiry that merely examines &quot;whether an accused can recount to his/her counsel the necessary facts relating to the offence in such a way that counsel can then properly present a defence&quot; is incompatible with the constitutionally entrenched responsibilities of the accused for directing the conduct of the defence. By failing to inquire into decision-making capacity, the &quot;limited cognitive capacity&quot; test runs the risk that persons who lack the capacity to make constitutionally assigned decisions will be permitted to do so. This may place the very rights that the <cite>Swain</cite> decision intended to protect in jeopardy.
<p>
The third criticism is that the <cite>Taylor</cite> decision did not consider how fair the trial would actually be for a mentally ill person found fit under the &quot;limited cognitive capacity&quot; test. In <cite>Swain</cite>, Lamer J. noted that &quot;it is a principle of fundamental justice that the criminal justice system not convict a person who was insane at the time of the offence. To the extent that it is a principle protected by the Charter, it is one of the
individual rights included in s. 7.&quot;  It is also, presumably, a principle of fundamental justice that an accused who is &quot;insane&quot; at the time of trial not be tried and convicted of an offence, but this may well be what the &quot;limited cognitive capacity&quot; test enables the court to do. In <cite>Taylor</cite>, Lacourciere J.A. implies that  Taylor would be found fit under the &quot;limited cognitive capacity&quot; test. Yet the court observed  Taylor's submissions and behaviour:  Taylor chose to represent himself and his submissions &quot;did not assist the court in any way.&quot;  He then left the court and refused to return. The psychiatric reports and testimony, with which the trial judge concurred based on his own observations of  Taylor's behaviour in court, clearly indicate that  Taylor was very likely to misinterpret the evidence before him and (if his submissions to the Court of Appeal are an indication) he will conduct his defence in a manner that will not even constitute a response to the charges.
<p>
The respondent Crown in <cite>Taylor</cite> conceded that the &quot;limited cognitive capacity&quot; test is
&quot;correct in Canadian criminal law&quot; but submitted that &quot;the law should make allowances for cases such as the present where the accused's mental disorder is so potent and extensive that it cannot be said that the person is capable of following the evidence, communicating rationally with counsel, or giving evidence which is responsive to the case for the Crown.&quot;<sup><a href="#onehundred">100</a></sup> The Crown also argued that the accused's delusions were &quot;so pervasive and irrational that he was `unable to perceive his own best interests and how these interests should be addressed in the course of a trial.'&quot;<sup><a href="#one01">101</a></sup> Apart from the question of imposing a &quot;best interests&quot; test,<sup><a href="#one02">102</a></sup> it would seem that the Crown's submission has merit. If  Taylor is not able to follow the evidence, communicate rationally with counsel (which would not necessarily include making the decisions that
counsel prefers---it would, rather, involve making decisions that are within his capacity to make),<sup><a href="#one03">103</a></sup> or give evidence that is responsive to the Crown's case, it seems obvious that his ability to participate meaningfully in the criminal process and &quot;assume the risks involved&quot; (the phrase used by Lacourciere J.A.) is fundamentally compromised. How can it be said that  Taylor will have a fair trial?
<p>
A fourth point is that the <cite>Taylor</cite> court did not devote sufficient attention to the appropriate ways to vindicate the rationale for the fitness rule. Lacourciere J.A. identified the rationale as follows:
<blockquote>
In order to ensure that the process of determining guilt is as accurate as possible, that the accused can participate
in the proceedings or assist counsel in his/her defence, that the dignity of the trial process is maintained, and that, if necessary, the determination of a fit sentence is made possible, the accused must have sufficient mental fitness to
participate in the proceedings in a meaningful way.<sup><a href="#one04">104</a></sup>
</blockquote>
This explanation is correct in law and is unobjectionable. The problem is that Lacourciere J.A. then added (as
though to modify the above statement):
<blockquote>
At the same time, one must consider that principles of fundamental justice require that a trial come to a final determination without undue delay. The adoption of too high a threshold for fitness will result in an increased number of cases in which the accused will be found unfit to stand trial even though the accused is capable of understanding the process and anxious for it to come to completion [<i>i.e.</i>, meets the &quot;limited cognitive capacity&quot; test].<sup><a href="#one05">105</a></sup>
</blockquote>
But lowering the threshold test for fitness is not the only way to resolve the issue of delay: why should the court be required to choose between a trial that is speedy and one that is fair? Surely an accused who is committed to stand trial while he is, or may be, unable to &quot;participate in the proceedings in a meaningful way&quot; is being denied the opportunity to exercise his s. 7 right. To accord an accused who is or may be unable to make decisions the right to make them is to provide him with an entitlement that is incomprehensible and illusory.
<p>
The fifth criticism is that the combined effect of <cite>Swain</cite> and <cite>Taylor</cite> serves to tie defence counsel's hands. Once the client has been found fit, counsel must follow the client's instructions. But an accused whose mental illness causes him to distort and misinterpret the evidence of his senses with regard to the motivations of others and the events and interactions occurring around him may be unable to participate in a functional lawyer-client relationship. The only alternative for counsel in these circumstances is to ask for permission to withdraw from the case. Withdrawal may add to the disadvantages that the mentally ill accused already faces, particularly given that the mentally ill accused who is unable to relate to his lawyer may also be unable to defend himself effectively (as the case of  Taylor amply reveals).
<p>
<cite>Swain</cite> and <cite>Taylor</cite> now constitute the law on the right of the fit accused to control his own defence, and the test for fitness. This fact must be acknowledged, and despite the aforementioned criticisms of the <cite>Taylor</cite> decision, the Guiding Principles in Section III will conform with the rules established in the <cite>Swain</cite> and <cite>Taylor</cite> judgments.
<p>
(c)  <cite>Brigham</cite><br>
<cite>Brigham</cite> was decided by the Quebec Court of Appeal, and as such is not binding on courts in Ontario. However, the decision was influenced by <cite>Taylor</cite>, and it specifically addresses several ethical issues that confront defence counsel in the context of fitness to stand trial. All of the facts and quotations described below are taken from the Court of Appeal judgment.
<p>
This case raised the question of counsel's ability to act against the accused's instructions with regard to permitting the accused to testify. Brigham was charged with three counts of first degree murder arising out of a bomb explosion in Montreal's Central Station. He had two trials, and the second trial is the subject of this appeal. Brigham did not testify, but immediately after the jury left to begin their deliberations he rose and made a statement to the trial judge, demanding that he be permitted to take the stand. The judge did not recall the jury to permit him to do this. He was found guilty, and upon hearing the verdict he made a long, rambling, and bizarre statement which was
tangentially related to the subject-matter of the charges. At the appeal,  a deposition was tendered which included a statement by Brigham (made on cross-examination) to the effect that &quot;the very basis&quot; of his  &quot;agreement&quot; with his counsel was that he would testify. He stated further that without being permitted to testify &quot;there was no other way [his counsel] was being hired.&quot;  He also said many bizarre and unrelated things.
<p>
Brigham's counsel at trial explained why he did not permit the accused to testify. He stated that counsel at the first trial had advised against it, and that a forensic psychiatrist who had examined Brigham had recommended that the accused not testify. In counsel's words, the psychiatrist had advised that &quot;although he was found fit to stand trial he was fragile and his condition could deteriorate in the course of the trial.&quot;  Counsel himself had  interviewed Brigham and the latter had &quot;expressed some extremely fantastic notions and at times it became very clear to me that he could not distinguish between fact and fantasy.&quot;  Counsel continued,
<blockquote>
[a]nd it became clear to me that . . . if he testified perhaps even without knowing that his ideas . . . and statements were not factual but fantastic . . . if he was asked a question or several question, he could give a series of answers based strictly on delusional material and fantasies that would have no relationship to reality or to normal factual experience. Therefore, testimony being based on truth or falsity, it was clear to me that his state of mind and his delusions would necessarily lead him into untruths which would jeopardize both himself and also it would not be
in his interest as an accused nor would it serve the interest of justice.<sup><a href="#one06">106</a></sup>
</blockquote>
He added, &quot;[l]astly, I thought from the standpoint of his being acquitted or not, I did not think it would be in his interest for him to testify.&quot;<sup><a href="#one07">107</a></sup> Counsel also deposed that he believed the Crown's case was weak.
<p>
A further factor was that the accused made a statement to counsel that could have been construed as a confession of guilt, or at least of connection with the crime, which the accused had until then denied. Counsel &quot;advised&quot; the accused not to testify and the accused &quot;was reluctant&quot; but did not dismiss counsel and did not testify (although he did make several speeches to the jury from the dock proclaiming his innocence). It should be noted that in addition to not putting the accused on the stand, counsel did not call any defence witnesses and made an extremely brief and general closing speech to the jury.
<p>
At the Court of Appeal, Fish J.A. defined the issues as &quot;the incompetence of his counsel, failure of his counsel to respect the terms of his retainer and the unfitness of appellant to stand trial.&quot;  The tone of the judgment seems strongly affected by the Court's view as to counsel's incompetence, but Fish J.A. stated that he would specifically address only the second two issues. With regard to the question of retainer, he found that it had been a condition of the retainer that  Brigham be permitted to testify, and that those instructions had not been altered. The Court seems to have believed Brigham rather than his counsel on this point. Fish J.A. held that counsel should have asked for leave to withdraw if he was uncomfortable with the accused's instructions. He then stated that  <cite>Swain</cite> had established the accused's right to testify in his own defence as a principle of fundamental
justice, and referred also to Arthur Martin's views on the subject (which were expressed with regard to the &quot;ordinary&quot; client---a distinction which the court did not identify). While there was &quot;no doubt whatever that [counsel] acted throughout in what he considered to be the best interests of appellant,&quot; &quot;the instructions of the client and not the motives of counsel determine whether an accused should be called as a witness.&quot;
<p>
Fish J.A. linked the fitness issue to the accused's right to testify and the more general question of the adequacy of his representation, and framed the issue in terms of the right to make full answer and defence. Fish J.A. discussed the fitness test, expressing the opinion that the accused would probably have been found unfit to stand trial under the test prevailing at the time.<sup><a href="#one08">108</a></sup> He concluded that &quot;[i]f Mr Brigham was convicted though unfit, he was in effect not `present at his trial'. . . . If he was fit, but not called, he was deprived of his right to testify in his own defense.&quot; Counsel, then, had &quot;either failed to protect appellant's right to be present, in fact and in law, or his right to be called as a witness.&quot;
<p>
Although the question of the accused being permitted to testify was linked in this case with counsel's retainer, it seems clear that this case reaffirms what was said in <cite>Swain</cite> and <cite>Taylor</cite>, namely, that the mentally ill accused must be permitted to testify if he so desires, regardless of counsel's opinion as to whether this would be beneficial or detrimental to the accused's case. The <cite>Brigham</cite> decision also makes it clear that counsel has an obligation to raise the fitness issue when it becomes apparent that the client's mental condition may be such that he is no longer fit. It is quite possible, however, that because the <cite>Taylor</cite> test has set such a high threshold for a finding of unfitness, a client in Brigham's position (<i>i.e.</i>, delusional, irrational) could now be considered fit: Taylor himself was delusional, and his delusions pertained to the judicial system, and yet the Court of Appeal implied that under the &quot;limited cognitive capacity&quot; test he could be found fit.
<p>
The <cite>Brigham</cite> case also raises an interesting question, which the court did not answer, about the extent to which counsel should consider herself constrained by the client's confession of guilt if the confession is made while the client is particularly ill or apparently unfit. (It is possible that the primary reason why  Brigham's counsel did not call defence witnesses was precisely because he felt constrained in the calling of affirmative evidence by the fact of  Brigham's confession). The common law has set out the &quot;operating mind&quot; and &quot;awareness of consequences&quot; tests to assist in determining the voluntariness (and admissibility) of confessions,<sup><a href="#one09">109</a></sup> but these tests do not address the <i>ethical</i> question as to whether counsel should be constrained by the confession in the way that she would be if a similar statement were made by an &quot;ordinary&quot; client. This issue underscores the point that a mentally ill client such as  Brigham may not be able to appraise the import or consequences of making a confessional statement to counsel in the way that an &quot;ordinary&quot; client would (and his ability to meet an &quot;operating mind&quot; test would also be questionable). The warning to the client about making confessions to counsel which is recommended by LSUC Rule 10, Commentary 11 might not be understood by the mentally ill client.
<p>
It is submitted that when counsel is called upon to make an ethical decision in these circumstances she should apply a test similar to that used in civil context to measure decision-making capacity: she should ask whether, at the time of making the confession, and after having been informed of the constraints that a confession would impose upon counsel, the client was capable of understanding information relevant to making the confession, and could understand the consequences of a decision to confess to counsel. If the answer is &quot;yes&quot; she should consider herself bound, and she would then need to explain her situation to the client and decide whether she should ask for leave to withdraw from the case so that the client could obtain other counsel, or whether she should continue to represent the client.
<p>
<h3>III.  The Guiding Principles</h3>
The concepts which have emerged from the foregoing analysis can now be formulated as Guiding Principles. The Guiding Principles are designed to be used in combination with the existing LSUC Rules of Professional Conduct. The precise relationship between the Guiding Principles and particular Rules is made apparent below.
<p>
These Guiding Principles are founded upon the proposition that <i>when acting for a client who suffers from a mental illness, the lawyer's role must be accommodated to meet the client's special needs.</i>
<p>
1. REPRESENTATION FOR THE MENTALLY ILL PERSON
<p>
The mentally ill client may have difficulty in arranging to obtain counsel. It is not uncommon for the lawyer to be asked to represent a mentally ill accused person by a member of that person's family or another interested individual. If, upon meeting with or contacting the mentally ill person, the lawyer observes that the mentally ill person is incapable of indicating whether it is his wish to retain the lawyer, or if the person refuses to retain the lawyer, she should take reasonable steps to ensure that the mentally ill person obtains a lawyer to represent him. &quot;Reasonable steps&quot; could include, for example, contacting duty counsel, or referring the mentally ill person's family member or other individual to the legal aid authorities or to another lawyer. In special circumstances, and presuming that the accused has not refused to permit the lawyer to represent him, the lawyer could request that the court appoint her to act for the mentally ill accused where s. 672.24 of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> applies.
<p>
2. COMPETENCE TO ACT FOR THE MENTALLY ILL CLIENT
<p>
Acting for the mentally ill client may require special skills. LSUC Rule 2 requires the lawyer to &quot;be competent to perform any legal services undertaken on the client's behalf,&quot; and Commentary 6 requires the lawyer to &quot;be alert to recognize any lack of competence for a particular task and the disservice that would be done to the client by undertaking that task.&quot;<sup><a href="#one10">110</a></sup> The mentally ill client's state of mental  health may affect his ability to participate in a normal lawyer-client relationship. Further, the mentally ill client's mental health needs and his status with respect to the civil mental health system may require the criminal lawyer to negotiate with professionals in that system in order to obtain appropriate support and protection for the client's interests in the course of the criminal process and potentially also at the dispositional stage of proceedings.<sup><a href="#one11">111</a></sup> The lawyer who recognizes a lack of competence to undertake the defence of a mentally ill client in these circumstances should be governed by Rule 2, Commentary 6: she should either decline to act, obtain the client's instructions to retain, consult, or collaborate with a lawyer who is competent in this field, and/or seek the client's instructions to obtain advice from experts in other non-legal fields. In the event that the lawyer declines to act, she should take reasonable steps to assist the client in obtaining another lawyer, and should consider the options described in Guiding Principle 1.
<p>
3.  COMMITMENT REQUIRED TO ACT FOR THE MENTALLY ILL CLIENT
<p>
The mentally ill client, by virtue of his disability, may require more of the lawyer's time and patience than would other clients. Relative to other clients, the mentally ill client may be less capable of identifying and effectively communicating his questions, needs, and instructions, and he may also be unable to understand and decide whether to act on the lawyer's advice. The lawyer for the mentally ill client must be prepared to initiate regular communication with the client and to provide the client with information and advice in a manner that will facilitate
the client's understanding of his legal situation and the choices available to him. (This is in keeping with CBA Chapter II, Commentary 2, and LSUC Rule 3, Commentary 2.) The lawyer for the mentally ill client must also be particularly vigilant to protect her client's interests, and this may require special efforts to identify and protect the client against potential threats to those interests (for example, by recognizing the client's vulnerability with regard to the making of incriminating statements,<sup><a href="#one12">112</a></sup> or his vulnerability to the influence of persons in authority, or to the influence of persons who might take advantage of his mental condition to
persuade him to accede to a particular course of action). The lawyer may also be required to make a greater effort to encourage the mentally ill client's trust and confidence in the lawyer-client relationship. The lawyer should take these factors into account in determining whether she is able to commit the resources necessary to represent the mentally ill client effectively.
<p>
4.  DECISION-MAKING AND THE MENTALLY ILL CLIENT
<p>
The mentally ill client's ability to make decisions that other clients would ordinarily make may be compromised. The lawyer in Ontario is bound (by <cite>Swain</cite> and <cite>Taylor</cite>) to follow the client's instructions about the conduct of the defence, once the client has been found fit to stand trial. However, <i>before the client has been found fit, or if the client has been found unfit and a disposition hearing is held,</i> the lawyer must conduct her own inquiry to determine whether the accused is <i>capable</i> of making the <i>particular</i> decision that needs to be made. The lawyer should take the following steps.
<blockquote>
<b>a)</b>  She should determine whether the client is able to understand the information that is relevant to making the particular decision, and whether he is able to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of a decision or lack of decision. This is a <b>&quot;capacity&quot; test.</b> If the client meets these criteria, the lawyer should proceed to (c), below. If the client does not meet these criteria, the lawyer may postpone the decision and re-assess the client's capability at another time. However, if the decision is one that should not be delayed, or if the client's mental condition is not likely to improve in time to make the decision, the lawyer should make the decision herself on the &quot;substitute judgment&quot; standard.
<p>
<b>b)</b> The <b>&quot;substitute judgment&quot;</b> standard requires that the lawyer take reasonable steps to ascertain from others (the client's physician or psychiatrist, other health care professionals, family members, friends, &quot;guardians&quot; under civil legislation, or other persons) what the client's preferences are or might be with regard to the particular decision or decisions. Since these persons might not know the client's opinion on a very specific issue (such as a psychiatric assessment), the lawyer should gather general information about the client's
preferences which could be extrapolated to apply to the particular situation (for example, the client may have declared a strong aversion to being an inpatient in a psychiatric hospital). This inquiry should enable the lawyer to
form an impression of the client's personality (in terms of his values and priorities) and an opinion about the client's current mental health needs, since these may interact with his legal situation. The lawyer should then identify the relevant &quot;costs&quot; or &quot;benefits&quot; to the client of adopting the various possible courses of action. The lawyer should encourage the client's involvement, to the best of the client's ability, in the making of the  decision. The lawyer must consider the import of the various options for this particular client, in these particular circumstances. Weighing all of these factors, and considering those factors which fall particularly within the lawyer's area of skill (namely, the advancement of the client's case <i>per se</i>), the lawyer must then make the decision. The lawyer's decision must not be based on what is best for other persons, be they mental health professionals, family members or friends of the client, or other individuals: the lawyer's responsibility is to her client, and her decision must be made in the interests of the client.
<p>
<b>c)</b>  If the client is capable of making the particular decision that needs to be made, the lawyer is responsible for taking all reasonable steps to ensure that the client's decision is <b>voluntary and &quot;informed.&quot;</b> Since a mentally ill client may have difficulty understanding relevant information, the lawyer's responsibility to enable the client to make an informed decision may be broader than that described in Rule 3 of the LSUC Rules of Professional Conduct. In particular, the lawyer should adapt her explanation to the particular needs of the client, and should explain carefully the alternative courses of action, what each alternative would require the client to do or refrain from doing, and the possible benefits, detriments and risks involved in each potential alternative. The lawyer should attempt to ensure that the client <i>understands</i> what the lawyer has said, and should assist the client in weighing the various factors. She should respond to all relevant questions that the client may ask. In order to attempt to ensure that the client's decision is informed, the lawyer may need to provide explanation and clarification on more than one occasion before asking the client to give instructions. This may be particularly important if the client's mental condition is variable, that is, if the client's ability to understand and weigh the relevant factors is better on some days and worse on others. When the client ultimately does give an instruction, the lawyer must follow it, as she would with other clients.
<p>
<b>d)</b> Even when the client has been found fit to stand trial, it is necessary for the lawyer to attempt to ensure that the client's decisions are <b>&quot;informed,&quot;</b> as defined in (c), above. In fact, it is particularly important for the lawyer to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the fit client's decisions are informed because a client can be found fit to stand trial even though he cannot meet the criteria for capacity to make particular decisions (as defined in (a), above). It is legitimate for the lawyer to advocate with the client, to exhort or encourage him to adopt a course which the lawyer believes will advance the client's case. However, if the client is unable to, or does not, fully understand and weigh the information and advice that the lawyer provides, or if the client refuses to listen to information or advice, the lawyer has no alternative (other than withdrawal, in the latter situation): she must follow the client's instructions.
<p>
<b>e)</b> Even when the client is capable of making particular decisions, it may be desirable to gather information about the client's situation and mental status from others. However, if the client is capable of making the decision to permit or forbid the lawyer to contact other persons, and has been informed about the merits and detriments of so doing, the lawyer must follow the client's instructions.
</blockquote>
5.  NEGOTIATING OR ENTERING A GUILTY PLEA, AND NEGOTIATING WITHDRAWAL OF CHARGES FOR THE MENTALLY ILL CLIENT
<p>
A guilty plea or a withdrawal of charges will usually take place before a fitness hearing is held and will result in the issue of fitness not being tried by the court.
<p>
The ethical requirements for negotiating a guilty plea are set out in LSUC Rule 10, Commentary 12: the lawyer must investigate and conclude that an acquittal is uncertain or unlikely, that the accused is prepared to admit the necessary factual and mental elements, that the client has been advised of the implications and possible consequences, and that the client has given instructions for the lawyer to negotiate a guilty plea.<sup><a href="#one13">113</a></sup> The requirements for actually pleading the client guilty (rather than negotiating with the prosecutor) are not set out in the Rules, but it would seem clear that the lawyer would need to arrive at the same four conclusions.
<p>
In order to determine whether the client is capable of instructing the lawyer to negotiate or to enter a guilty plea, the lawyer must apply the fitness test and should also apply the capacity test (as set out in 4(a), above). The lawyer must apply the fitness test because this is the test that would be applied if the accused were to stand trial (and be called upon to plead guilty or not guilty). Another reason why the fitness test must be applied is that it is designed to ascertain that the accused knows enough about the court process (for example, the role of the judge and prosecutor, the charge, the consequences of the proceedings, etc.) to be able to recognize what is happening to him. Although the mentally ill client who pleads guilty will not need to sit through a trial and watch these roles and tasks being played out, he will still need to understand the meaning of a guilty plea and its potential consequences, such as a criminal record and a criminal sanction. Support for the application of the fitness test for a guilty plea may also be derived from s. 672.25(2)(a) of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> which provides that when the issue of fitness arises before the close of the prosecution's case at a preliminary inquiry, trial of the issue cannot be postponed beyond the point at which the accused is called upon to answer the charge. This provision implies that accused's ability to meet the fitness test is a precondition to entry of a plea.<sup><a href="#one14">114</a></sup>
<p>
The fitness test is the bare minimum. There are several reasons why the lawyer should also apply the capacity test. First, in the context of a guilty plea, the lawyer, not the court, will be determining the client's fitness: the court must presume that the accused is fit<sup><a href="#one15">115</a></sup> and the judge cannot move that fitness be tried unless she has &quot;reasonable grounds&quot; to believe that the accused is unfit.<sup><a href="#one16">116</a></sup> Since the accused's mental state may not be apparent to the court in the short period of time that it takes to enter a plea, the lawyer who pleads the mentally ill client guilty assumes the responsibility of assuring that her client is in fact fit to do so. Given that this process is devoid of the &quot;checks and  balances&quot; that would be present in a full fitness hearing (<i>i.e.</i>, witnesses, cross-examination, and a determination by the judge), the lawyer must be particularly careful to ascertain that the client is able to appreciate the nature and consequences of a guilty plea. The advantage of the capacity test is that it measures the client's ability to make the decision to plead guilty, which is what the defence lawyer needs to determine. Once the capacity test has been met, the lawyer would address the consent provision (4(c), above).
<P>
A second reason for applying the capacity test and the consent provision is to satisfy the lawyer that the client is prepared to admit the necessary factual and mental elements of the offence. If the case goes to trial the lawyer would
not need to make this determination: no one would, not even the trier of fact, because the latter is responsible for determining whether the accused has been proven guilty of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt, not whether he is
prepared to admit the factual and mental elements of the offence. By measuring the client's capability to make these admissions, the capacity test and consent provision act as a safeguard for the client and the lawyer.<sup><a href="#one17">117</a></sup>
<p>
Support for the use of these tests can be found in the <cite>ABA Mental Health Standards</cite>, which incorporate certain similar concepts. Standard 7--5.1 reads, in part:
<blockquote>
<b>a)</b> No plea of guilty . . . should be accepted from a defendant who is mentally incompetent to enter a plea of guilty.
<blockquote>
<b>(i)</b> Ordinarily, absent additional information bearing on defendant's competence, a finding made that the defendant is competent to stand trial should be sufficient to establish the defendant's competence to plead guilty.
<p>
<b>(ii)</b> The test for determining mental competence to plead guilty should be whether the defendant has sufficient present ability to consult with defendant's lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and
whether, given the nature and complexity of the charges and the potential consequences of a conviction, the defendant has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings relating to entry of a plea of guilty.<sup><a href="#one18">118</a></sup>
</blockquote></blockquote>
The Commentary Introduction explains that the requirement for understanding the plea proceedings &quot;does not correspond precisely to lay knowledge expected of defendants undergoing trial,&quot; but rather relates to issues such as the &quot;constitutional rights relinquished through a plea, the process of admitting guilt, and the exercise of free will inherent in tendering a voluntary plea.&quot;<sup><a href="#one19">119</a></sup>
<p>
Negotiating the withdrawal of charges is a separate issue. There are no specific CBA or LSUC ethical guidelines for this process. As a matter of principle, the lawyer should always attempt to have the charges against her client withdrawn if this is feasible (from the Crown's point of view) and if it would be beneficial to the client. An unconditional withdrawal of charges would obviously be beneficial, but a conditional withdrawal may or may not be. For an unconditional withdrawal, the lawyer need not apply either the fitness test or the capacity test, because  the client is not called upon to understand the criminal process or to make any decisions about his own participation in it. For a conditional withdrawal, the lawyer should apply the capacity test (set out in 4(a), above). If the client is capable of making a decision to accept, reject, or attempt to modify the Crown's proposed conditions, and if the consent provision (4(c), above) has been addressed, then the lawyer must follow the client's instructions. If the client does not meet the capacity test, the lawyer must apply the substitute judgment test (set out in 4(b), above). The lawyer must be very careful to ensure that any option to divert the client from the criminal system to, for example, the mental health system, is a more favourable option for this particular client in these particular circumstances than pleading the client guilty (assuming that the client is capable of, and consents to, so pleading) or proceeding to trial
(and ultimately having the fitness issue tried). In particular, the lawyer must consider whether it is likely that the Crown will not be able to establish a case to answer before the fitness issue is tried; the likelihood of the accused being found fit; the effect of the trial itself upon the accused's ability to maintain a state of fitness; the disposition (in terms of location and length) to which the client could potentially be subject if found unfit; the likelihood of securing an acquittal; and the type of disposition to which the accused could be subject if found either NCR or guilty. In performing the substitute judgment test, the lawyer must carefully balance these factors against the effect of a mental health-related (non-criminal) condition upon the client. The lawyer must carefully weigh the fact that she will probably not be there to &quot;see the client through&quot; a disposition that is outside the criminal system. The decision will not be an easy one, and the lawyer must gather as much information as she can in order to arrive at a solution that will secure the best possible disposition for the client.
<p>
6.  RAISING THE FITNESS ISSUE
<p>
Chernoff and Schaffer identify the central dilemma: &quot;[t]he attorney who feels that raising the issue of competence is contrary to his client's interests is . . . placed in a position where his obligations as an officer of the court appear inconsistent with his ethical and professional responsibility to represent his client effectively.&quot;<sup><a href="#one20">120</a></sup> This dilemma could perhaps be characterized as more apparent than real because the obligation to raise the issue of fitness is a situation in which the lawyer's duty to the court and her duty to protect the client's fair trial interests coincide (although a <i>finding</i> of unfitness may not be in keeping with the lawyer's goals for the management of the client's case). The <cite>ABA Mental Health Standards</cite> impose a duty on defence counsel to move for evaluation of the defendant's competence to stand trial (or to otherwise bring the matter to the attention of the court and prosecutor) &quot;whenever the defence counsel has a good faith doubt as to the defendant's competence.&quot;<sup><a href="#one21">121</a></sup> In
Canada the ethical position has not been articulated in the CBA or LSUC codes; however, in the <cite>Brigham</cite> case, the court indicated an expectation that the lawyer would inform the court when she suspects that the client's mental condition has deteriorated to a point where he may no longer be fit.<sup>,a href="#one22">122</a></sup>
<p>
There are several rationales for requiring defence counsel to raise the issue of fitness when the client's mental condition renders his fitness questionable. If the client is unfit he is not mentally &quot;present&quot; in court; in effect, his trial is proceeding in his absence. To fail to inform the court that the client may no longer be &quot;present&quot; amounts to deceiving the court, and does the client a disservice. The lawyer must protect the
incapacitated client's &quot;right&quot; to be present during his own trial, and she must protect the integrity of the trial process by ensuring that the client is &quot;present.&quot; The consequences of raising the fitness issue (in terms of delay and the potential consequences of a finding of unfitness) can be significant, particularly if the trial is almost over, but difficult as it might be for defence counsel to be ethically compelled to raise the fitness issue at a late point in the trial, the lawyer is duty-bound to raise the issue.<sup><a href="#one23">123</a></sup> (Note that in order to determine whether the client's mental condition warrants raising the issue, the lawyer must apply the fitness test rather than the capacity test).
<p>
The lawyer who believes that the client may be unfit must raise the issue when it is apparent, but the issue will
not be tried until (at least) after the Crown has shown that it is in a position to prove the act(s) alleged (<cite>Taylor</cite>). It is also possible to ask the court to exercise its discretion under s. 672.25 of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite> to postpone the trial of the fitness issue. It could be postponed (1) until the accused is called upon to answer the charge, where the issue arises before the close of the prosecution's case at the preliminary inquiry, (2) until after the close of the Crown's case, or (3) even later, where the issue arises before the close of the case for the prosecution at trial. Since it will almost always be in the client's interests to obtain an acquittal before the court tries the issue of fitness, it would seem logical to adopt a policy of always asking the court to postpone the trial of the issue of fitness. However, the difficulty with this proposition is that if the lawyer does not succeed in securing the accused's discharge at the end of the Crown's case, and if the accused is then found fit and called upon to present a defence, the accused's idea of an appropriate defence strategy may be inconsistent with the approach that the defence lawyer had adopted at the preliminary inquiry or throughout the Crown's case-in-chief at trial. At best, the accused will have lost the opportunity to lay the groundwork for his defence by eliciting favourable  testimony from Crown witnesses, and at worst, the accused will have to &quot;switch defences in mid-stream&quot; by abandoning the possible defences that the lawyer raised during the Crown's case and initiating an entirely different defence. The accused's chance of securing an acquittal may be decreased, and the lawyer could be in a position of having compromised the accused's ability to choose his own defence (which is, as we have seen, a Constitutional entitlement under s. 7 of the <cite>Charter</cite>. It is also an ethical responsibility under the LSUC Defense Counsel guidelines [Checklist #1]).<sup><a href="#one24">124</a></sup> Therefore, when deciding whether to ask the court to postpone the trial of the issue of fitness, the lawyer must weigh carefully the chance of securing the accused's discharge before the issue is tried against the chance that the accused's ability to present his own defence could be compromised.
<p>
If the lawyer is able to receive necessary information about the accused's version of the facts and views about a possible defence, then she should request that the trial of the fitness issue be postponed at least until the end of the Crown's case. If the lawyer is not able to receive this information, but she is convinced that the chance of discharge is good, and she believes that she can attack the Crown's case in a way that will minimize the risk that the client's ability to present a defence (if he becomes able to communicate one, and/or if he is later called upon to present one) will be compromised, she can propose that the trial of the fitness issue be postponed.
<p>
7. CONFESSIONS BY THE MENTALLY ILL CLIENT TO THE LAWYER
<p>
LSUC Rule 10, Commentary 11, and CBA Chapter IX, Commentary 11, provide that the lawyer will be constrained in the conduct of the defence &quot;if the accused clearly admits to the lawyer the factual and mental elements necessary to constitute the offence&quot; and the lawyer is &quot;convinced that the admissions are true and voluntary.&quot;  In order to determine whether the mentally ill client's admissions are &quot;voluntary,&quot; the lawyer should apply the capacity test (in 4(a), above) and the consent provision (in 4(c), above). If the client meets the criteria, the lawyer must comply with the constraints of Rule 10, Commentary 11 (or withdraw), but if the client does not meet the criteria, the lawyer should not consider herself constrained.
<p>
8.  RAISING THE NOT CRIMINALLY RESPONSIBLE DEFENCE
<p>
This issue was decided in <cite>Swain</cite>. A fit accused can decide whether or not to raise the defence, and the Crown can raise it if the accused has put his mental condition in issue or if the accused has otherwise been found guilty of the offence charged. The lawyer should inform herself about the possible dispositions to which the client could be subject if the defence were to be successful or if the accused were to be convicted of the offence(s), and should thoroughly advise the client of the possible risks, benefits, and detriments involved in each option. The choice, however, lies entirely with the client, and the lawyer must follow his instructions.
<p>
9.  CEASING TO ACT FOR THE MENTALLY ILL CLIENT
<p>
If, at any point, the lawyer is discharged by the mentally ill client, she should take reasonable steps to assist the client in obtaining another lawyer. This is not currently a requirement under the CBA rules or the LSUC rules, but it may well be necessary if the client's mental illness or circumstances would make it difficult for him to secure alternate representation. ABA Model Rule 1.16 imposes a stricter standard on the question of discharge, and would constrain the lawyer even when the client purports to discharge her:
<blockquote>
[i]f the client is mentally incompetent, the client may lack the legal capacity to discharge the lawyer, and in any event the discharge may be seriously adverse to the client's interests. The lawyer should make special effort to help the client consider the consequences. . . .<sup><a href="#one25">125</a></sup>
</blockquote>
But as a practical matter it would be difficult for a lawyer to maintain a lawyer-client relationship with a client who, for any reason, and regardless of competence, is determined to discharge her. The requirement in this Guiding Principle that the lawyer assist the client to find another lawyer would seem to be a more realistic approach.
<p>
When determining whether to exercise her discretion to withdraw under LSUC Rule 8 or CBA Chapter XII, the lawyer should evaluate the &quot;serious loss of confidence&quot; or &quot;refusal of the client to accept and act upon the lawyer's advice on a significant point&quot; in light of the accused's mental condition. What would constitute a serious loss of confidence on the part of a mentally ill client may be different from that which would constitute a loss of confidence by other clients, and the mentally ill client's refusal to act on counsel's advice might not go &quot;to the very basis of the [lawyer-client] relationship.&quot;
<p>
One final point of note is that the CBA rules (Chapter XII, Commentary 5 and note 6) permit the lawyer to withdraw &quot;if unable to obtain instructions from the client,&quot; because &quot;failure to instruct counsel constitutes repudiation which counsel could accept and terminate the employment.&quot;  The LSUC rules contain no such provision. The lawyer who has been retained, but who cannot receive instructions, should not indiscriminately exercise the discretion permitted in the CBA rule. It would be wrong to abandon a client who  cannot give instructions because the client would obviously be very unlikely to be capable of securing other counsel. If the lawyer does decide to withdraw, she should take all reasonable steps to ensure that the accused obtains another lawyer (see Principles 1 and 2).
<p>
<h3>IV.  Conclusion</h3>
The proposals and principles described above could be applied in the Canadian context in several ways. First, the unique ethical issues that arise when the client is mentally ill, and the corresponding need to adapt the lawyer's role to meet the client's particular needs, could be addressed by including elements of the Guiding Principles in standards of professional conduct. These elements could be incorporated into existing rules, or perhaps established as  additional guidelines in a special section. The requirement that the lawyer take &quot;reasonable steps&quot; to assist the accused in finding appropriate counsel (Principles 1, 2, and 9), the application of the capacity, consent, and substitute judgment tests for clients whose fitness has not been tried or whose unfitness has been judicially determined (Principle 4), the guidelines for raising the fitness issue (Principle 6) and arranging guilty pleas and the
withdrawal of charges (Principle 5), and the test for determining whether ethical constraints should apply after a confession (Principle 7), could serve as supplemental standards, filling gaps between existing rules, or as interpretive guides, adapting certain general rules to the specific context of the mentally ill client.
<p>
Second, the ethical concerns evoked by the establishment in Ontario of the &quot;limited cognitive capacity&quot; test for fitness to stand trial may be addressed through judicial revisitation of this issue, should it arise in a case before the Supreme Court of Canada. As was argued in Section II (E) above, a test that includes evaluation of decision-making capacity is consistent with the definitional standard for fitness to stand trial in s. 2 of the <cite>Criminal Code</cite>. The accused's fair trial interests (under s. 7 of the <cite>Charter</cite>) could also be interpreted as supportive of such a test. This approach would bring the threshold test for fitness into alignment with the decisional responsibilities and entitlements of the accused (and the corresponding role of counsel) that were established in <cite>Swain</cite>. It would also obviate the ethical concerns that currently arise when counsel is required to comply with decisions that clients are authorized, yet potentially incapable, to make.
<p>
Third, policy makers and legislators could devote more attention to defining the respective responsibilities of the civil mental health system and the criminal justice system for the mentally ill. Entry to both systems is currently based on behaviour, but the civil commitment requirement for &quot;dangerousness&quot; sets a higher test than the criminal requirement for the commission of a criminal offence (which includes a host of non-dangerous &quot;nuisance&quot; behaviours and minor property offences). The criminal system also makes use of a cognitive test (the fitness test), but despite the fact that the &quot;limited cognitive capacity&quot; threshold for a finding of unfitness is higher than an &quot;analytic capacity&quot; standard or a test designed to evaluate decision-making ability, it is still, in many cases, easier to capture the accused under this provision than to establish his  &quot;dangerousness&quot; under the civil test. Both systems offer some incentive to consent to treatment, but the
incentive is much stronger in the criminal system where criminal jurisdiction (and often initial custodial disposition) is maintained---in the current absence of &quot;capping&quot; provisions---until fitness is attained. The  establishment and interpretation of these tests, by policy makers, legislators, and the courts, will affect incentives to choose between the two systems, and these determinations should not be made without taking these effects into
consideration. Channelling the mentally ill  person through the criminal system is rational and adaptive in the current incentive structure, but it may not be in keeping with the goals, orientation, and primary responsibilities of the two systems. More importantly, it may not provide appropriate responses to the needs of the mentally ill person himself.
<p>
If the fitness test is to be altered to incorporate a decision-making standard, the threshold for a finding of unfitness will be lowered, thereby increasing the incentive to invoke the criminal system. Accommodation (that is, a lowering) of the civil threshold might well be a necessary accompaniment to the adoption of this test. Lowering
the civil threshold would also respond to the ethical concerns of defence counsel who must, for example, seek the release of the client from the criminal system (through withdrawal of charges, or through discharge or acquittal)
despite the fact that the client is suffering from a serious mental illness, or raise the fitness issue and risk a finding of unfitness even when the client is charged with a minor criminal offence. The criminal system is a blunt and often
inappropriate instrument for the management of mental health problems: alterations to the civil standard to enable the mental health system to respond more effectively to these needs would both serve the interests of the mentally
ill person and ease the ethical burdens that defence counsel currently bear.
<p>
The purpose of this paper has been to give structure and substance to ethical intuitions about the appropriate role for defence counsel when acting for the mentally ill client. It is hoped that these principles and proposals will contribute to discussion and development of standards and initiatives grounded in, and supportive of, an ethic of responsible advocacy for the mentally ill.

The specific procedure, evidentiary rules, and other matters are set out in ss 672.58, 672.59, 672.62, 672.6, and 672.75, and the notice of application for treatment regulations. The relationship between these provisions and the civil mental health statutes (particularly those governing consent to treatment) is ambiguous, and these provisions may well be subject to constitutional challenge under ss 7 and 12 of the <cite>Charter</cite>, <i>supra</i> note 2, (and potentially also on division of powers grounds under the <cite>Constitution Act, 1867</cite>, as enacted by the <cite>Constitution Act, 1982</cite>). Judges do not appear to be ordering Treatment Dispositions at the present time.

Health 28. Data for 1992 was kindly provided by Mr Henry Tyrell of the Ontario Criminal Code Review Board. Other figures provided by the Board for the pre-reform years are as follows. Number of unfit patients entering the system in Ontario: 1985 (35), 1986 (43), 1987 (66), 1988 (60), 1989 (66), 1990 (56), 1991 (57).
<p>
<li><a name="eleven">The fact</a> that the 1983 study examined persons who were <i>currently</i> being held on warrant (some of whom had been on warrant for several years), while the 1992 figures pertain to unfit persons

<li><a name="sixty7">The ideas and concepts</a> discussed in this section are drawn from several sources. First,  Al O'Marra, currently an Assistant Crown Attorney in Brampton, Ontario, and  Richard D. Schneider, defence counsel in Toronto, Ontario, discussed some of these issues with the author, thereby assisting in the development and clarification of concepts and ideas. Second, lecturers, seminar leaders, and workshop participants involved in an education program entitled &quot;The Mentally Disordered: Arrest to Disposition&quot; (jointly sponsored by the Ontario Crown Attorneys' Association and the Criminal Lawyers' Association), <i>supra</i> note 12, articulated the wide range of views and values that arise in the context of defending the mentally ill client in criminal matters. Third, the author's reading of the civil commitment literature provided some preliminary concepts that could be developed and adapted to the criminal defence context. There is a large body of literature on the subject of legal advocacy more generally, from a variety of ethical and philosophical perspectives: Tremblay, <i>supra</i> note 21, identifies a range of views, and lists (among other works) Mazor, &quot;Power and Responsibility in the Attorney-Client Relation&quot; (1968) Stan.

He explains: &quot;[w]hen we think about treatment of incompetent patients without their consent, we should not think in terms of medical necessity overriding the value of informed consent. Instead, we should only think in terms of acting in circumstances in which informed consent is not possible. When we allow an incompetence exception to informed consent, we are not balancing the value of autonomy with the value of beneficence. Rather, we are admitting that our normal way of showing respect for that person is not appropriate and that another vehicle must be found.

<li><a name="ninety8">Bonnie explains</a> that a legal system which establishes that &quot;certain decisions regarding the defense or disposition of the case must be made by (or are within the prerogative of) the defendant himself or herself&quot; is based upon &quot;a norm of client autonomy,&quot; and &quot;[s]ome construct of `decisional competence' is an inherent, though derivative, feature of any legal structure&quot; that is based on the concept of autonomy.

<p>
<li><a name="one03">Welch</a> points out that it is difficult to separate the question of capacity from the question of making an &quot;appropriate&quot; decision. He identifies &quot;[a] very real difficulty . . . in deciding whether competence can be determined apart from judging particular decisions. On the one hand, we
want to avoid the danger of judging as incompetent those with whom we disagree. . . . On the other hand, an analysis of a patient's decision has a role in determining competence. It is difficult to know how to judge a person's
competence apart from looking at that person's decisions. We have a clearer notion of what an autonomous decision is than we do of what an autonomous person is.&quot; Welch, <i>supra</i> note 30 at 1626--7.

<p>
<li><a name="one11">ABA Model Rule 2.1,</a> which addresses offering advice to the client, includes the following: &quot;In representing a client, a lawyer shall exercise independent professional judgment and render candid advice. In rendering advice, a lawyer may refer not only to law but to other considerations such as moral, economic, social and political factors, that may be relevant to the client's situation.&quot;  The commentary provides, in part, that &quot;[m]atters that go beyond strictly legal questions may also be in the domain of another
profession. Family matters can involve problems within the professional competence of psychiatry, clinical psychology or social work. . . . where consultation with a professional in another field is itself something a
competent lawyer would recommend, the lawyer should make such a recommendation.  At the same time, a lawyer's advice at its best often consists of recommending a course of action in the face of conflicting recommendations of experts.&quot;  <cite>ABA Model Rules</cite>, <i>supra</i> note 18.

<h1>Canada's Use of Economic Sanctions for Political and Human Rights Purposes
<p> 
ALLEN ROSEN</h1>
<p><br>
<center><h3>ABSTRACT</h3></center>

In the last few decades, economic sanctions have become an increasingly popular tool of national foreign policy among Western nations, including Canada. The author examines most of the major episodes in which Canada has imposed economic sanctions for political and human rights purposes, and discusses the principal legal, moral, and political issues connected with Canada's use of economic sanctions. The author concludes that despite some legal and ethical objections to the employment of economic sanctions, the sanctions policies adopted by recent Canadian governments have on the whole been defensible and successful.
<p>
Au cours des derni&egrave;res d&eacute;cennies, les sanctions &eacute;conomiques sont devenues, pour les nations occidentales dont le Canada, un puissant outil de manipulation en mati&egrave;res d'affaires ext&eacute;rieures. L'auteur relate la plupart des &eacute;pisodes durant lesquels le Canada s'est servi de sanctions &eacute;conomiques &agrave; des fins politiques et &agrave; l'encontre de violations des droits de la personne. Il discute des principaux probl&egrave;mes juridiques, moraux et politiques associ&eacute;s &agrave; l'utilisation de telles sanctions par le Canada. L'auteur conclut qu'en d&eacute;pit de certaines objections juridiques et &eacute;thiques, la politique adopt&eacute;e par les gouvernements canadiens r&eacute;cents demeurent, dans l'ensemble, justifiable et fructueuse.

<H3>BILBY<P>

<I>Macrotis lagotis</I></H3>

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="Photo of Bilby" SRC="bilby.gif"><P>

Description</B><P>

The Bilby is the largest of several species of bandicoots (family Peramelidae) found in Australia.  It is 

of light delicate build and is variable in size ranging in length from 30 to 55cm with a maximum tail 

length of 23cm.  The long soft fur is generally fawn-grey, blue-grey or ash-grey in colour except for the 

underparts of the body which are white.  The distinctive tail is black with a white tip.  Other 

distinguishing features are a long snout which is naked from the nose back along the top of the muzzle 

for about 2cm and the ears which are long like those of a rabbit. The ears not only aid in  hearing but 

also assist in thermoregulation by acting as radiators of body heat. They have unusually long hind 

limbs.  The forearms are however, short and powerful to allow it to dig deep burrows in the soil.  The 

front feet have three prominent toes with long, strong claws which are used for digging.  The female 

tends to be much smaller than the male and although she has eight teats inside her backwardly opening 

pouch, she usually only rears two young.<P>

<B>Distribution</B><P>

The distribution of this marsupial has been greatly reduced over the past 200 years. Before European 

settlement in Australia, the Bilby was scattered over most of Australia, below 18 degrees South latitude 

in arid to semi arid environments. The Bilby is now restricted to the Kimberleys in WA, the Tanami 

Desert of Alice Springs and areas in SW Queensland where rainfall does not exceed 250mm.  

Remaining distribution in these areas is very patchy.<P>

<B>Conservation Status and Threats</B><P>

Reasons for the Bilby's <B><I>endangered</I></B> status include habitat loss, introduction of 

livestock, introduced predators and competition for food by rabbits.  In Western Australia they were 

considered as pests and were shot for pelts.<P>

Major threats are predation and competition from foxes and habitat destruction by introduced 

herbivores.<P>

<B>Diet</B><P>

Insects , larvae, seeds, bulbs, fruit, fungi, lizards and small mammals.<P>

<B>Reproduction</B><P>

The Bilby has a gestation period of approximately only 12.5 days. The female's pouch contains 8 teats. 

There are rarely more than 2 young in the pouch at a time. Young are kept in the pouch for 75 days. 

<P>

<B>General Information</B><P>

Originally inhabiting arid to semi arid woodlands, the Bilby is now restricted to hummock grasslands 

and acacia  shrublands with various soil types and spinifex or tussock grass.  It is more commonly 

found in areas that are regenerating after fire.  The Bilby is a nocturnal animal and uses its burrow to 

escape the heat of the day. The burrow can be up to 3 metres long and as deep as 1.8 metres. The 

entrance is against a termite mound, or small shrub and the burrow entrance is open at all times. <P>

<B>Research Program</B><P>

The few remaining wild populations of bilbies are small and highly fragmented and less than 50 

individuals are held in captive breeding programs.  Because of the small populations, inbreeding and 

genetic drift threaten the long term survival of the species.  It is therefore imperative that we gain a 

meaningful understanding of bilby reproduction and behaviour so that current state-of-the-art 

reproductive technologies can be applied.  This will maximise the genetic variation and natural 

reproductive potential of the bilby, thus enhancing its prospects for long term survival.<P>

<H3>CRYOBANK STORAGE TECHNOLOGY</H3>

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="Photo of oocyte" SRC="oocyte.gif">

Animal and human tissue and reproductive cells can be preserved indefinitely by a process of freezing 

the samples in a special chemical media or protective substance.  The samples are frozen in a step wise 

procedure and stored at either -196 C or at -80 C.  This process is known as cryopreservation.<P>

<B>Semen</B><P>

The most common procedure, in the past, has been the collection of semen from fertile breeding males.  

The fresh semen is diluted with buffer salts to maintain its physiological status and a special 

cryoprotective agent is added to protect the cell structure during freezing.  Following this, the sample is 

slowly frozen over 1-4 hours until it reaches the storage temperature of -196 C, this extremely low 

temperature is achieved by using liquid nitrogen which naturally maintains a temperature of -196 C.<P>

On removal of the samples from liquid nitrogen, the semen samples can be thawed at 37 C to retrieve 

the sperm cell which can then be used for fertilization and breeding.<P>

<B>Embryos</B><P>

Over recent years it has been possible to collect embryos (fertilized eggs) from selected breeding 

females.  Again, using a similar procedure as with semen, the embryos can be processed and frozen for 

indefinite storage at -196 C in liquid nitrogen. Upon thawing these embryos can be transferred to 

breeding recipient females for development and birth.<P>

<B>Tissue Samples, Testes and Ovaries</B><P>

With the advent of new assisted reproductive techniques, IVM; IVF; ICSI; and ET; (as described in the 

fact sheet 'Technology Developments') it is now feasible to collect and preserve testes and ovaries from 

valuable endangered animals that die.<P>

The testes or ovaries can be removed from animals for up to 24-36 hours following death without losing 

the reproductive cells.  The samples are then placed into special transport tissue media before being 

transferred to the Centre's laboratory for processing and storage at -196 C.<P>

Current techniques enable the non-motile (visually dead) sperm cells preserved in the testicular tissue to 

be used in ongoing breeding programs.  This is achieved by the microinjection of the individual sperm 

into eggs (oocytes); ICSI.<P>

The recovery and utilization of unfertilized eggs (oocytes) from freshly collected ovarian tissues is more 

difficult.  Our ongoing research programs are directed at isolating the 100's of oocytes present in the 

freshly collected ovary and freezing these for future fertilization.<P>

Alternatively, in some species it is possible to use the frozen ovarian tissue, post thawed by grafting this 

into recipient animals.  Once the grafted tissue has established growth it is possible to harvest the newly 

matured oocytes, fertilize and transfer them to recipient animals to develop and nurture.<P>

Exciting developments!  These and other such technical advances will all contribute to assisting in the 

preservation of our endangered wildlife, where their genetic value would otherwise be lost through death 

resulting from car accidents, fire, fights or disease outbreaks.  The breeding potential of these animals 

can be saved for the future and returned to the breeding population through the newly developed 

procedures of assisted reproduction.<P>

<H3>LONG-BEAKED ECHIDNA<P>
<I>Zaglossus bruijni</I></H3><P>

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="Photo of echidna" SRC="echidna.gif">

<B>Description</B><P>

This species from New Guinea is a large, variably furred echidna with a much longer and more 

down curved bill than the more common Short-beaked Echidna.  Like the Short-beaked 

Echidna it has spines of varying length interspersed with fur on the back, sides and tail.  The 

snout is tubular with a very small mouth, through which the long tongue can be rapidly 

extruded and retracted.  The echidna vary in size from 7 - 8.5 kg and attain a length of 

approximately 60cm. <P>

<B>Conservation Status and Threats</B><P>

Wherever Long-beaked Echidnas are found, human population densities are low.  They are 

listed as a <B><I>rare</I></B> species and are reported as being extinct in large areas of the 

New Guinea Central Highlands.  They appear also to have declined in the Telefomin area over 

the past 20 years, where traditional taboos against eating them have begun to break down 

under missionary influence. <P>

<B>Distribution</B><P>

The Long-beaked Echidna is widespread in New Guinea, being reported from both the 

western and eastern extremities of the island.  It is absent from the Fly plains and northern 

New Guinea at altitudes below 1200m, as well as all of the North Coast Range.  It has been 

reported from a wide variety of altitudes ranging from sea level to 4150 metres.<P>

<B>Diet</B><P>

Although there are some reports that the Long-beaked Echidna will eat ants and termites, the 

primary food of the Long-beaked Echidna is almost certainly worms.  Apparently worms are 

probed with the long beak until the end is found.  The tongue is  then extruded and the worm 

impaled on the unique backwardly pointing spines of the tongue tip.<P>

<B>General Information</B><P>

Little is known of the natural history of Long-beaked Echidnas even, apparently by the native 

people of New Guinea.  It is almost certain that they lay eggs and by analogy with the Short-

beaked Echidna it is also likely that they carry their young in a pouch.  It is suspected that 

breeding in the Long-beaked Echidna is seasonal because reproductively active animals were 

caught in July and a male caught three and a half months later showed regression of the 

testes.<P>

Long-beaked Echidnas are inquisitive and relatively unafraid even when recently captured and 

seldom make any noise other than a soft snuffling, snorting sound.<P>

<B>Proposed Research </B><P>

Taronga Zoo holds the only examples of this species outside New Guinea.  Work has already 

commenced on reproductive cycling in the female.  Fundamental research is necessary to breed 

the species in captivity.  Even short beaked Echidnas very rarely breed in captivity.<P>

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="Photo of snow leopard and cub" SRC="leopard.gif">

<B>Cats</B> - Most of the 36 non-domestic cat species are considered to be endangered or threatened with 

extinction.  The main reasons for the decline of natural populations of these species include poaching 

and the destruction of natural habitats and ecosystems.  As the populations decrease in size further 

problems result from the reduced genetic variability and demography.<P>

<B>Conservation and Assisted Reproduction</B><P>

There is a need to conserve these species from extinction by sustaining rare and previously dwindled 

populations.  Unfortunately the reproductive rate of many of the non-domestic cat species in captivity is 

poor.<P>

Captive breeding programs, in conjunction with assisted reproductive techniques, could play a major 

role in ensuring population numbers and genetic biodiversity.  The techniques include gamete and 

embryo cryopreservation, in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization, in vitro culture and embryo transfer, 

ultimately resulting in the long term survival of these species.<P>

Incompatibility between breeding partners is a major reason for the lack of success in captive breeding 

programs in endangered cat species.  Assisted reproductive techniques can produce embryos for 

transfer.  However due to limited numbers of any target species, surgical procedures used for 

transferring the embryos may compromise the animals.  Alternate species of similar reproductive 

physiology may be used as surrogates for embryo transfer in an attempt to increase target species 

populations without compromising valuable individuals.<P>

The initial target species chosen for their critical status are:<P>

a)	Asiatic Golden Cat<P>

b)	Clouded Leopard<P>

c)	Snow Leopard<P>

<B>Research Program</B><P>

The domestic cat is an excellent model for developing assisted reproductive technologies for potential 

use in endangered and threatened non-domestic cat species.<P>

The following research areas are being investigated in an attempt to successfully save the endangered 

cat species from extinction:<P>

a)	Optimization of the assisted reproductive techniques such as; in vitro maturation, in vitro 

fertilization - including microinjection techniques of ICSI and SUZI (Intercytoplasmic Sperm 

Injection and Subzonal Sperm Injection, respectively) and in vitro embryo culture in the domestic 

cat.<P>

b)	Develop successful techniques for the cryopreservation of gametes (sperm and eggs) and embryos 

for preservation or later use in breeding programs around the world.<P>

c)	Application of these techniques will lead to successful embryo production and transfer resulting in 

the preservation and conservation of rare, threatened and endangered cat species.<P>

d)	Develop a successful protocol for the transfer of embryos from target species into surrogate 

species of similar reproductive physiology in an attempt to increase population numbers without 

compromising valuable individuals.<P>

<H3>AMPHIBIANS - FROGS</H3>

<B><I>Frogs</I></B> - are the common name for the many species of tailless amphibian (vertebrates that 

can live both in  and out of the water) of which there are approximately 200 varieties currently 

identified in Australia.<P>

Recent Australian evidence has identified a drastic and unexplained decline in total frog population 

numbers with the extinction of at least 10 species.<P>

Currently, about 34 species of Australian frogs are classified as being endangered.<P>

Virtually all of Australian frog species have evolved over the 50 million years during the continents 

evolution and are unique to our environment.  The habitat ranges from the wet tropics of Queensland to 

the cold mountain regions of Tasmania including large areas of arid central desert.<P>

The direct cause of the decline and extinction of these species is unknown but likely possibilities include 

viral diseases, declining natural habitat, an increase in UV radiation due to the ozone effect and a rise in 

environmental temperature.<P>

<B>Conservation and Cryopreservation</B><P>

To ensure against the continuing or possible total loss of species facing extinction there is an urgent 

need to preserve these rare populations.<P>

This can be achieved through the combined resources of conservation of captive populations in safe, 

protected environments in conjunction with the storage of gametes (male and female breeding cells - 

sperm, eggs and embryos).<P>

The initial targeted species selected because of their critical status, are the: <P>

Green and Gold Bellfrog (<I>Litoria aurea</I>)<P>

Red-crowned Toadlet (<I>Pseudophyryne australis</I>)<P>

<B>Conservation Program</B><P>

The conservation objective is to establish and maintain protected captive breeding colonies.  It will also 

be necessary to store reproductive tissues as insurance for future assisted breeding thereby maintaining 

the breeds genetic base and survival.<P>

With the success of captive breeding colonies, and the identification and control of current mortality loss 

in natural populations, it will be possible to safely release new stock to repopulate the barren natural 

habitats.<P>

<B>Research Program</B><P>

To achieve the aims of the conservation program our research is currently directed at:<P>

a)	breeding these frogs in captivity, so that they reproduce and mature in line with those in the 

natural environment;<P>

b)	develop techniques of assisted breeding to foster the breeding program such as artificial 

insemination techniques;<P>

c)	Develop appropriate methods to freeze and store semen, eggs and embryos for permanent 

preservation and later use in future breeding programs.<P>

Frogs are critical in maintaining an ecological balance in our environment. The preservation of this 

ecosystem relies on the survival of  all species within the 'web of life' (eg. frogs, fish, insects, birds etc.). 

Please help us to achieve this.<P>

In long-term captive breeding programs, it is necessary to have large numbers of animals in order to avoid inbreeding and loss of genetic fitness.  It is very expensive to maintain large numbers of animals in captivity. If animals can be maintained as sperm, eggs and embryos, then many more animals of many more species could be preserved. <P>
The Institute of Reproduction and Development has pioneered the development of techniques for collection and cryogenic storage of reproductive tissues (sperm eggs and embryos) in human and domestic animals (cattle, horses, sheep, goats and dogs). <P>
The Animal Gene Storage  and Resource Centre of Australia will now extend and transfer these procedures to wildlife to offer new opportunities for increasing populations and improving genetic management of      endangered species.</EM></LEFT>

<LEFT><STRONG>The Animal Gene Storage and Resource Centre of Australia</STRONG>, in association with Australian and international zoological parks, and wildlife and conservation organizations, has accepted this challenge and needs financial and material support to achieve its goals. <BR>
     The Animal Gene Storage and Resource Centre of Australia priorities are directed to assisting the implementation of on-going action plans for the preservation of the regions endangered species. The range and number of species threatened with extinction is enormous. The different classes of species and their widely varying environmental habitats create significant problems in achieving  positive results. The immediate approach is to select a range of model target species and to concentrate research resources in line with ongoing conservation programs in the region.<P>
<EM>Conservation Goals  </EM><BR>
The immediate goal is to restore and maintain viable populations of threatened species which are facing extinction or are   classified as endangered or vulnerable. <BR>
     To successfully achieve the goals within practical and economic parameters, research and conservation programs will initially be directed to a selective range of animals. These target species will become the conservation models for future programs.</LEFT>

<STRONG>Collection of reproductive resources</STRONG><BR>
International and Australian researchers have defined procedures for the practical collection of live semen from the major wildlife species including an extensive range of Australian marsupials. 
In time, it will be possible to collect oocytes (unfertilised eggs), embryos and semen from such species as the elephant, rhino, tiger, leopard, monkey and giraffe, but techniques need to be adapted for these species from those developed from humans and domestic animals. <BR>
   A major advance of relevance to survival of critically endangered species is the capacity to salvage testes and ovaries from dead animals. Sperm cells and eggs can be removed from these organs and frozen for future use in captive breeding programs.<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT ALT="Foetus" SRC="fetus.gif">
<RIGHT><STRONG>Cryogenic storage of sperm, eggs and embryos. </STRONG>
Today it is possible to process and store viable sperm and embryos in liquid nitrogen facilities at ultra low temperatures (-196 C). Such storage preserves genetic resources indefinitely, when they can be reintroduced and utilized in new breeding programs. <BR>
    Current research is concentrating on establishing similar procedures for the viable freezing of oocytes collected directly from the ovary. Preservation of reproductive tissues ensures preservation of the genetic resources of rare breeders for use generations after death. Allied with this and in combination with tissue DNA analysis is the capacity to manage the genetics of captive populations so that deleterious effects of inbreeding are avoided. <BR>
   Such frozen resources can be rapidly and safely transported across international borders to assist in local breeding programs.</RIGHT><P>

Traditional 
methods of artificial insemination (AI) using fresh and frozen semen can be successfully used for captive breeding programs for wildlife species. The major constraint to the widespread adoption of AI in wildlife is our limited knowledge of the female reproductive physiology of many wild species. This area of research warrants immediate attention if successful artificial breeding is to be achieved. <BR>
    Exciting new techniques include test tube fertilization of eggs with both mobile and dead sperm cells (IVF), maturation and growth of eggs in tissue media (IVM), and the ability to split embryos. Such procedures can now be introduced to assist in development of embryos prior to  their transfer into the reproductive tract of recipient females. These techniques are now available to assist in saving our wildlife, similar advances in the detection of changes in the female reproductive cycle through specific hormone assays of blood, urine, faeces or saliva are now enabling assisted breeding programs to achieve their targets.<P></LEFT>

<H3>MALLEE FOWL<P>

<I>Leipoa ocellata</I></H3>

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="Photo of Mallee Fowl" SRC="mallfowl.gif">

<B>Description</B><P>

The Mallee Fowl is a large sedentary bird.   Average size is  approximately 600mm in length 

and weighing approximately 15kg.  It is mottled black, brown and white in colour with a white 

underside and a large black band extending from the neck to the breast.<P>

<B>Conservation Status and Threats</B><P>

The Mallee Fowls main threat is predation by foxes.  In fact, no young have been known to 

survive in the past three years due to fox predation.  This is further exacerbated by the clearing 

of Mallee scrub for farming and competition for food from sheep, goats and rabbits.   

Mallee Fowl were rare even at the time of first settlement, but with clearing of land for farming, 

and the introduction of  foxes and cats the bird became rarer and is listed as an 

<B><I>endangered</I></B> species.<P>

<B>Distribution</B><P>

Found in Mallee country of inland southern Australia.<P>

<B>Diet</B><P>

The Mallee Fowl normally lives without water, but is dependant on Mallee scrub for food. This 

includes acacia and cassia seeds. After rain they vary their diet by eating such things as herbs, 

flower blossom, beetles and cockroaches.<P>

<B>Breeding</B><P>

Mallee Fowl breed once a year commencing in Spring. They return to the nest each year and 

repair it. The nest is a huge mound made of sand and leaf litter, and the sides are sometimes up 

to 1.5 metres in height and can be 3 metres wide.  The centre is dug out and half filled with 

leaves and bark collected by the male in winter. When it rains, the leaves and bark soak up 

water and begin to ferment and rot. The temperature then begins to rise. The leaf litter is 

covered by soil and sand which keeps in the heat  of the rotting leaves.  When the centre of the 

mound reaches the correct temperature the female lays her eggs She then covers them with the 

leaves.  In the breeding season, depending on the availability of food, up to 24 eggs can be 

laid. Generally an egg is laid every 4 to 8 days. The male maintains the temperature to within 

one degree of its original heat by digging and letting the hot air out regularly.  The eggs hatch 

after 7 or 8 weeks of being laid.  The young burrow up to the surface and can fly within 24 

hours.  If the rain comes late, the Mallee Fowl may not breed at all.<P>

Mallee Fowl have the same mate for life but are seldom seen together away from the nest as the 

male must maintain the nest while the female searches for food to sustain her egg 

production.<P>

A captive breeding group has been established at Western Plains Zoo.  This group is used to 

generate chicks for release by the National Parks and Wildlife Service into areas where foxes 

are intensively controlled.<P>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#CCCC66" TEXT="#000000" LINK="#993300" VLINK="#555555">

<H3>BRIDLED NAILTAIL WALLABY<P>

<I>Onychogalea fraenata</I></H3>

<B>Description</B><P>

The Bridled Nailtail Wallaby is grey in colour with a white 'bridle' line running from the centre 

of the neck down behind the forearm on each side of the body and has a horny pointed 'nail' on 

the tip of its tail.  Head/body length is up to 700mm (males) and 540mm (females).  Adult 

specimens vary in size from 4 to 8 kg.<P>

<B>Distribution</B><P>

Although once widespread on the slopes and plains to the west of the Great Dividing Range in 

semi-arid inland, it is now only known as a small, single population on a reserve near Dingo in 

central Queensland.  This population is closely managed by the Queensland National Parks and 

Wildlife Service.<P>

<B>Conservation Status and Threats</B><P>

The Bridled Nailtail Wallaby was thought to be extinct until 1973, when it was recognised 

near Dingo, as there had been no confirmed sightings for 42 years.<P>

The Bridled Nailtail Wallaby is classified as <B><I>endangered</I></B> and the most likely 

cause of its decline in recent years is habitat destruction by the pastoral industry.  It is difficult 

however to isolate  any single cause for its decline as the loss in numbers has been so rapid.  

Other causes are likely to be predation by foxes and feral cats and competition with rabbits.  

The dingo is another threat to the Bridled Nailtail Wallaby and these animals have been 

removed from their only remaining  reserve in central Queensland to ensure the remaining 

Bridled Nailtail Wallaby population's survival.<P>

<B>Diet</B><P>

Bridled Nailtail Wallaby both grazes and browses.  It eats both flowering plants and grass in 

roughly equal proportions.<P>

<B>General Information</B><P>

The Dingo population exhibits a preference for scrub sedges, sheltering during the day in the 

shrubland and grazing from evening to early morning in grassy woodland.<P>

During the day, the Bridled Nailtail Wallaby rests in a slightly dished patch of bare ground 

scratched out beside a bush or tree.  It commences to feed around dusk.  It is usually a solitary 

animal but females may have young at heel and congregations of up to four or five animals are 

not uncommon.<P>

When in danger it may seek refuge in hollow logs, it can also avoid detection by lying prone in 

long grass or by crawling out of sight under low shrubs where it remains even when closely 

approached. <P>

<B>Proposed Research</B><P>

A group of wallabies has been established at Western Plains Zoo as a hedge against loss of 

population.  It is proposed to develop techniques for assisted reproduction and storage of 

eggs, sperm and embryos to improve genetic management of the species.<P>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#CCCC66" TEXT="#000000" LINK="#993300" VLINK="#555555">

<H3>BLACK RHINOCEROS<P>

<I>Diceros bicornis</I></H3>

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="Photo of rhino" SRC="rhino.gif">

<B>Description</B><P>

The black rhinoceros is a territorial and solitary animal which can be aggressive.  It has a head and 

body length of 3.0 - 3.8 metres and stands between 1.4 - 1.5 metres at the shoulder.  It weighs 1000 - 

1800 kg (average weight  - 1400kg).  The length of the front horn is from 50 to 135cms.  The most 

distinguishing feature is the prehensile upper lip which is used to pluck branches and leaves from 

shrubs, being the main food source for this species.<P>

<B>Distribution</B><P>

In 1984 Zimbabwe held the only true wild , viable and increasing population of black rhinoceros on the 

African continent.  Populations elsewhere had decreased due to illegal poaching.  In 1970  there were 

over 65,000 black rhinoceros estimated to be in Africa.  By 1980 this number had plummeted to 15,000 

and to just over 3,000 in 1990.  The main cause for this decline is illicit killing for the horn which is 

prized for Asiatic medicines, aphrodisiacs and dagger handles.<P>

<B>Reproduction</B><P>

A single young weighing 20-60kg is born after a gestation of 419-476 days.  <P>

Females are fertile from 4.5 until 28 years of age and are capable of calving every 3-4 years allowing 

for gestation and lactation periods.<P>

<B>General Information</B><P>

Poaching has reduced the total wild population from 65,000 in 1970 to less than 2,000 today.  The total 

number of Black Rhino in captivity is about 200.<P>

Conservation efforts for Black Rhino include <I>in situ</I> programs such as the establishment of 

intensive protection zones (IPZ's) which are fortified areas of natural habitat into which nuclei of rhino 

have been consolidated.  Intensive management centres (IMC's) and private conservancies exist to 

provide security and control of captive management but within the natural habitat.  These <I>in 

situ</I> efforts are supplemented by organised dehorning programs as well as armed guards and 

special anti-poaching squads.<P>

<I>Ex-situ </I> conservation involves a global captive breeding program designed to ensure the 

survival of the black rhinoceros in the wild by augmenting the gene pool outside Africa.  A large part of 

the captive breeding program involves research that is directly applicable to management, propagation 

and conservation.<P>

The Zoological Parks Board of NSW is a member of the International Rhino Foundation which has 

established a formal agreement with the Government of Zimbabwe under which Black Rhino were 

relocated to Australia and the USA for protection and captive breeding, with the long-term objective of 

release of animals back into the wild. <P>

Western Plains Zoo (WPZ), a property of the Zoological Parks Board, currently holds the only Black 

Rhino in Australasia.<P>

The Zoological Parks Board of NSW is collaborating with other members of the International 

Rhinoceros Foundation, the Government of the Republic of Zimbabwe, the Institute of Reproduction 

and Development of Monash University and veterinary and medical practitioners in a sophisticated 

breeding programme for this species.  This programme will be based on natural breeding supplemented 

with assisted breeding techniques including artificial insemination, embryo transfer, in-vitro fertilisation 

and the long-term cryogenic storage of sperm, eggs and embryos.<P>

<B>Assisted Reproductive Technology</B>

The survival of our native wildlife depends on the maintenance of their native habitat.  With the decline 

and degeneration of available native habitat, the continued survival of a great number of our wildlife 

species will depend on reserves of captive or protected breeding populations.  The recent development of 

assisted breeding technology and animal gene banks will enhance and aid in the ability to maintain and 

preserve these species <P>

Over the last 20 years, artificial breeding (AB) techniques have been established in our domestic animal 

species.  Initially developed for our domestic dairy cattle breeds, AB has extended to include beef cattle, 

sheep, goats, deer, horses and even the family dog and cat.<P>

In more recent years these techniques have been extended into our own breeding relationships to 

overcome high levels of infertility in men and women.  These techniques have included the now common 

procedures of semen collection, semen freezing, artificial insemination, in vitro (or test tube) fertilization 

and the transfer of embryos.<P>

The successful utilization of these new procedures has resulted in significant gains in fertility and a 

definite increase in offspring.<P>

Now these methods of assisted reproductive technology can be adopted and utilized for assisting in 

ongoing conservation programs to preserve and save our endangered or threatened native animals.<P>

The assisted reproductive techniques include:<P>

<B>Semen Collection</B><P>

Semen can be artificially collected from valuable or rare males that are either not capable of natural 

breeding or for safety, cannot be paired with the appropriate female.<P>

<B>Semen Freezing</B><P>

Semen can be stored for years ( 5, 50 or 150 years) if it is frozen and stored at extremely low 

temperatures (up to -196OC).  This semen once thawed, can be utilized in assisted breeding either by  

transferring directly to the reproductive tract of the female or using it in test tube fertilization 

procedures.  Frozen semen can be transferred across the country to help maintain the genetic diversity of 

isolated populations.<P>

<B>Artificial Insemination (AI)</B><P>

The assisted transfer of semen (either freshly collected or from stored frozen reserves), into the 

reproductive tract of the breeding female.<P>

<B>Collection and Preservation of Reproductive Samples</B><P>

Reproductive tissues, ovaries and testes can be collected from endangered animals that either die 

accidentally or through illness.  These tissues can be preserved by freezing, and utilized in future 

breeding programs by extracting sperm and egg cells for <I>in vitro</I> (test tube) maturation (in vitro 

maturation - IVM), fertilization and culture.<P>

<B>In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)</B><P>

Eggs (oocytes) can be collected from both live and recently dead females.  These are cultured or injected 

with sperm cells to achieve assisted fertilization.<P>

<B>Intercytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI)</B><P>

Even with a single sperm using a microinjection technique it is possible to transfer the sperm directly to 

the egg to achieve artificial fertilization - this is known as intercytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).<P>

<B>Embryo Transfer (ET)</B><P>

Fertilized eggs (embryos) can be collected from one female and transferred to a recipient female.  These 

transfers are undertaken with very early embryos (day 5-9 following fertilization), and remain in the 

recipient or surrogate mother for the duration of the pregnancy.  Similar techniques are now available 

for embryos fertilized in the test tube.<P>

These recent technological advances along with sophisticated biological procedure currently in

<H3>NORTHERN HAIRY-NOSED WOMBAT<P>

<I>Lasiorhinus krefftii</I></H3>

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="Photo of wombat" SRC="wombat.gif">

<B>Description</B><P>

The Northern Hairy-nosed Wombat is predominately brown-grey, or grey mottled with fawn, 

brown or black.  It is distinguished from the Common Wombat by silky hair and longer ears.  

It is a large heavily built marsupial 80-100cms long .<P>

Wombats have short powerful forelimbs with strong, flattened claws for digging.  They have 

poor eyesight but this is compensated by a highly developed sense of smell.<P>

<B>Conservation Status and Threats</B><P>

The Northern Hairy-nosed Wombat is categorised as <B><I>endangered</I></B>. Only 62 

animals survive.  These are aging and reproductive success is low.  The rapid decline of this 

animal has been due, at least in part, to competition with such introduced grazing animals as 

the cattle, sheep and rabbits. <P>

<B>Distribution</B><P>

In the 19th century this species was present in New South Wales.  It now survives only in a 

small national park near Epping Forest Station in tropical Queensland.  It prefers subtropical, 

semiarid woodland and grassland on sandy soil.<P>

<B>Diet</B><P>

The main food is grasses and like the Southern Hairy-nosed Wombat, it feeds predominately 

on grasses and other herbage.  As an adaptation to the high fibre content of this diet, the teeth 

are rootless and grow continuously throughout the wombat's life.  Wombats are nocturnal and 

will graze each night for 3-8 hours travelling 3-4 kms in search of food.<P>

<B>Reproduction</B><P>

Its reproductive biology is unknown.  The species has never been bred in captivity.<P>

<B>Research Proposal</B><P>

It is proposed to establish a satellite population at Western Plains Zoo.  Two young males will 

arrive in mid 1996.  The first step is to develop techniques for collecting and storing semen so 

as to maintain existing levels of genetic variability which is reduced already in comparison to 

Common Wombats.<P>

Research on reproductive cycles in Common Wombats has commenced.<P>

<H3>The role of platelet derived growth factors in the testis</H3><P>
<EM>Dr. Kate Loveland, Professor David de Kretser and Dr. Stefan Schlatt</EM><BR>
Recognizing that intracellular and intercompartmental communication is essential for normal testicular function, this study evaluates the role of platelet derived growth factors and their receptors in these processes.<P>

<H3>Stem cell factor and its receptor c-kit and activins in the testis</H3>
<EM>Dr. Kate Loveland, Dr. Stefan Schlatt and Professor David de Kretser</EM>, in collaboration with Dr. Andreas Meinhardt (University of Marburg, Germany)<BR>
Growth factors appear to be essential for normal growth in germ cell survival and differentiation. This project assesses the role of these substances and whether mutations in these receptors can disrupt spermatogenesis.<P>

<H3>Microtubule associated proteins and spermatogenesis</H3>
<EM>Dr. Kate Loveland, Daniella Herszfeld and Professor David de Kretser</EM><BR>
Microtubules, cytoskeletal elements that are involved in a range of cellular processes, are prominant in many cell types within the testis, especially in the sperm tail and in the final maturation of sperm. Their formation and stability is influenced by microtubule associated proteins and this project evaluates the role of these proteins in the control of a number of cellular events that lead to the formation of mature spermatozoa.<P>

<H3>Isolation of genes encoding proteins which comprise the sperm tail</H3>
<EM>Dr. Moira O'Bryan, Dr. Kate Loveland and Professor David de Kretser</EM>, in collaboration with Professor Milton Hearn, Department of Biochemistry, Monash University<BR>
The sperm tail is a very complex structure which is crucial to the capacity of the sperm to move. While detailed descriptions of the sperm tail and the manner in which it is formed are available, little is known of the composition of certain prominant elements in the sperm tail. This project has developed methods to isolate these components of the sperm tail and to analyse the protein composition with a view to identifying genes encoding for these proteins. The longer term aim is to assess whether mutations in these genes may be responsible for structural defects in the sperm tail and dysfunctional motility.<P>

<H3>Factors regulating the multiplication of Sertoli cells</H3>
<EM>Dr. David Simonrangkir (PhD student), Dr. Nigel Wreford, Dr. Stefan Schlatt, Dr. Kate Loveland and Professor David de Kretser</EM><BR>
The Sertoli cells are key elements in the sperm producing tubules in the testis and, in addition to regulating the environment of the inner aspect of the tubule, they nuture developing germ cells. These cells proliferate in foetal and prepubertal life, but in the adult are stable. Little is known of the mechanisms which control the rate of division of Sertoli cells, and this study is evaluating the manner in which these cells behave, both in vitro and in vivo.<P>

<H3>Actions of FSH and testosterone in spermatogenesis</H3>
<EM>Dr. Nigel Wreford and Professor David de Kretser</EM>, in collaboration with Dr. Robert McLachlan, Liza O'Donnell and Sara Meachem, Prince Henry's Institute of Medical Research<BR>
Gonadotrophins (hormones produced by the pituitary gland) and testosterone, which is produced by the Leydig cells located between the testicular tubules, are absolutely essential for sperm production. This project investigates how the gonadotrophins act through the Sertoli cells to influence spermatogenesis. Testosterone acts through the Sertoli cell by mechanisms which may involve adhesion molecules that keep the sperm precursors "attached" to the Sertoli cell.<P>

<H3>The role of microdeletions in the  Y chromosome in male infertility</H3>
<EM>Professor David de Kretser and Con Mallidis (PhD student)</EM>, in collaboration with Associate Professor Schally Bhasin, University of California, Los Angeles, Dr. Robert McLachlan, Prince Henry's Institute of Medical Research and Dr. Gordon Baker, University of Melbourne<BR>
In approximately 50% of men with low or absent sperm count, we are unable to indicate the cause. This project evaluates whether deletions of DNA from the Y chromosome in these men may be a cause for their infertility.<P>

<H3>The capacity of  alpha 2-macroglobulin to bind activin and related proteins</H3>
<EM>Dr. David Phillips and Professor David de Kretser</EM>, in collaboration with Professor Milton Hearn, Department of Biochemistry, Monash University<BR>
Activin and inhibin are both hormones and growth factors which significantly affect FSH production by the pituitary gland and in turn this stimulates spermatogenesis. We are evaluating the capacity of alpha 2-macroglobulin, follistatin and other binding proteins to modulate the activity of these substances and to assess the effects of this binding and their capacity to modulate FSH secretion.<P>

<H3>The role of activin in the amniotic sac in pregnancy</H3>
<EM>Professor David de Kretser and Lynda Foulds</EM>, in collaboration with Associate Professor Graham Jenkin, Department of Physiology, Monash University and Dr. Jim McFarlane, Department of Physiology, University of New England<BR>
During investigations to evaluate the role of inhibin and activin in pregnancy, we demonstrated that activin was present in significant concentrations in the amniotic sac during pregnancy. We are assessing the nature of the activin present, its source of produciton and its role in the physiology of pregnancy.<P>

<H3>Follistatin, site of production and actions in the testis</H3>
<EM>Professor David de Kretser and Dr. David Phillips</EM>, in collaboration with Dr. Andreas Meinhardt, University of Marburg, Germany, Dr. Jim McFarlane, University of New England, Associate Professor Iain Clarke, Prince Henry's Institute of Medical Research, Dr. Alan Tilbrook, Department of Physiology, Monash University and Professor Milton Hearn, Department of Biochemistry, Monash University<BR>
Follistatin is an activin binding protein which can neutralize many of the actions of that substance. Little is known of the site of production of follistatin, both within and external to the testis. Further, little is known of the cellular site of production of this substance in the testis. These matters are being evaluated in this project.<P>

<H3>Macrophages and lymphocytes in the testis and their action in the immunology of the testis</H3>
<EM>Dr. Mark Hedger and Dr. Godwin Imade (PhD student)</EM><BR>
Some men who are infertile have developed an immune response to their own sperm and produce inactivating antibodies, proteins that can render sperm immotile or interfere with the recognition process between the sperm and the egg which occur during fertilization. The areas adjacent to the sperm-producing tubules contain cells called macrophages that are important in limiting and controlling development of the immune response. It is apparent that there are unique testicular mechanisms that normally prevent the formation of antisperm antibodies. In this project, we have identified important differences in the function of testicular macrophages and have characterized the components involved in the immune response (lymphoid cells) in the testis. Ultimately these studies will increase our understanding of why some men develop antibodies to sperm.<P>

<H3>Macrophage inhibitory factor and its role in the testis</H3>
<EM>Dr. Mark Hedger and Professor David de Kretser</EM>, in collaboration with Dr. Andreas Meinhardt, University of Marburg, Germany and Dr. Richard Bucala, Picower Institute, New York<BR>
The role of macrophages in the testis may be important in modulating the immune environment in which the sperm develop. A protein, called macrophage inhibiting factor (MIF) has been identified in many tissues, and this project evaluates the site of production of this substance within the testis and its role in testicular physiology.<P>

<CENTER><IMG  ALT="Endangered Species Program Attracts International Support" SRC="head1.gif"></CENTER><P>
Last year, the Institute formed a partnership with the Zoological Parks Board of NSW to establish the Animal Gene Storage Centre of Australia. The centre aims to preserve rare and endangered wild species, and the genetic diversity of both wild and valuable domestic animals, through the preservation of reproductive tissues.<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT ALT="rhino" SRC="photo1.jpg">
<RIGHT>One of the species the program aims to protect is the African Black Rhinoceros. It is estimated that there are less than 2,000 black rhinos surviving in the African wild. <BR>
Ian Gunn, a senior research fellow at the Institute, recently received a three year research grant from the International Rhino Foundation USA. Ian's study involves collection and preservation of semen from the male black rhinos at Western Plains Zoo in Dubbo.<BR>
Meanwhile, masters' student Andrew Thorne is studying the reproductive biology of the female rhino throughout her breeding cycle. Little is currently known about the female breeding cycle, so results from this study will assist rhino breeding programs throughout the world. This study also examines the potential role of assisted reproductive technology (such as IVF) in improving the breeding efficiency of the breeding herd in Australia.<P>
<STRONG>Footnote:</STRONG> The first black rhino (pictured here with his mother) to be born in captivity in Australia was delivered at the Western Plains Zoo in late May.<P></RIGHT>

<CENTER><IMG  ALT="Institute Director Honoured" SRC="head2.gif"></CENTER><P>
<IMG ALT="Photo of Professor de Kretser" ALIGN=LEFT SRC="photo2.jpg">
<RIGHT><STRONG>Professor David de Krestser</STRONG>, Director of the Institute of Reproduction and Development, was elected a fellow of the prestigious Australian Academy of Science in May.<BR>
Professor de Kretser was one of 12 fellows elected at the Academy's annual general meeting. Election to the Fellowship recognises a career that has significantly advanced the world's store of scientific knowledge. An official statement by the academy said "David de Kretser is unquestionably one of the world's leading reproductive biologists".<BR>
As well as directing the Institute, Professor de Kretser heads its testicular physiology group. The group conducts a range of studies exploring fundamental elements of testicular function. Among Professor de Kretser's research achievements, as cited by the Academy, are "the definitive account of human spermatogenesis and demonstrating ultrastructural defects in spermatozoa from infertile men".<BR>
Professor de Kretser said he was priveleged to be made a fellow of the Academy. "This honour recognises research excellence and productivity and highlights the team effort of the people I have worked with. It is also an accolade for the Faculty of Medicine, of which the Institute is a part."</RIGHT><P>

<CENTER><IMG  ALT="From Fertility Regulation to Prostate Cancer" SRC="head3.gif"></CENTER><P>
<STRONG>Some years ago, we began research to identify the molecules involved in the cross-talk between the ovary, the testis, and the pituitary gland (located at the base of the brain) which controls their function. This work lead to the identification of three proteins that regulated the way the pituitary gland controls ovary and testis function: inhibin, activin and follistatin.</STRONG><BR>
These proteins clearly have an important role to play in the control and stimulation of fertility. Surprisingly, they are also important in the control of many processes in our bodies: fetal development, stimulation of red blood cell formation, the initiation of lactation, modulation of the immune system and many others. Professor David Healy, head of the Institute's gynaecology and infertility research group, and his colleagues have developed a test for certain types of ovarian cancer by measuring inhibin in the blood of post-menopausal women.<BR>
So what does this have to do with prostate cancer? <STRONG>Dr Gail Risbridger</STRONG>, who heads our prostate biology group, has shown that the prostate gland secretes inhibin and activin and the two proteins have important regulatory effects. She is actively investigating the role of these proteins in prostate cancer, based on evidence of their growth promoting and suppressing effects, and the published work of international colleagues, who have proposed that the gene for one of inhibin's subunits is a tumour suppressor.<BR>
Prostate cancer is the second largest cause of <STRONG>male</STRONG> cancer in Australia, killing approximately 2,500 men each year. The Institute is committed to a major expansion of our work in this area, based on Dr Risbridger's research group and our interface with the Urology Service at Monash Medical Centre.<BR>
Many men remain ignorant of the potential life threatening role this small gland can play. Our program will not only address the potential control of prostate diseases including cancer, but will expand our educational activities in the community. The Institute has already been instrumental in conducting public workshops on prostate disease, which have attracted audiences of over 350 men every time. <BR>
We look to the community for support to expand this important work. Fact sheets about prostate disease and other aspects of men's health are available from the Institute by telephoning 9905 9014.<BR>

<CENTER><IMG  ALT="Absent Parts of the Y Chromosome: Links to Male Infertility" SRC="head5.gif"></CENTER><P>
Small segments missing from the Y chromosome have been identified as a cause of low sperm count in joint studies by the Institute of Reproduction and Development and Drew University in Los Angeles.<BR>
In over 40% of patients with a low or absent sperm count, no cause has been found. It has been recognised for many years that some patients with zero sperm count have a small Y chromosome. Through the Human Genome Project, knowledge of DNA sequences on human chromosomes has increased, enabling the development of relatively simple biochemical technologies. Using these technologies, the team of researchers chemically tested the integrity of the Y chromosome. The study showed that in approximately 15% of men with severely lowered sperm counts, very small segments of the chromosome appear to be missing (deleted). The deletions are not passed from father to son.<BR>
Further studies are required to identify the genes that are missing. Once identified, the genes can be studied to assess their role in sperm production. Some men with this chromosomal abnormality still have sperm present in their ejaculate. They will be candidates for assisted reproductive techniques, especially intracytoplasmic sperm injection, where a single sperm is injected into an egg. It is likely that any males conceived from this technique will have the same Y chromosome deletion.<P>

Associate Professor Michael Adamson and Mr Ron Williams recently received awards from Monash University marking 25 years of service.<BR>
Assoc Prof Adamson, who heads the Institute's Paediatric Sleep Monitoring Unit, joined the university in 1969 as a lecturer in the department of paediatrics. He later co-founded the neonatal intensive care unit at Queen Victoria Hospital. Mr Williams, now a senior laboratory technician with the Institute's neonatal and fetal physiology groups, joined the university a few months later.<BR>
It was only fitting that the two should jointly celebrate their quarter century, as Prof Adamson was on Mr Williams' interview panel all those years ago.</TD>

The commercial was developed by advertising agency Clemenger Melbourne, which supports the Institute by providing a range of advertising services at no charge.</STRONG><BR>
Adopting the theme "Every month our need for funds grows a little more", the commercial depicts a woman at various stages of her pregnancy, concluding with her baby in her arms. The commercial actually took nine months to film, and the Institute expresses grateful thanks to all concerned, particularly the mother and child.</LEFT><P>

<STRONG>Targeting a total of $10 million, the Institute of Reproduction & Developments Capital Appeal to fund the building of a new facility to house our every expanding programs, is almost 75% subscribed. </STRONG><BR>
    Our Leadership Committee lead by Mr Charles Curwen has so far secured donations of almost $7.5 million.  Major donors include Monash University, John T Reid Charitable Trusts, Ray Williams - HIH Winterthur, Serono Australia, Organon Australia, the Krongold Foundation, ICI Australia, Monash Medical Centre Division of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, the Eric Smorgon Trust, Genetics Australia and the Pratt Foundation.<BR>
<CENTER><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=680>
<TR ALIGN=TOP><TD WIDTH=280>    For some time the scientists, clinicians and administrative personnel who make up the Institute have been working in extremely cramped conditions.  Guests to the Institute, particularly scientists from overseas, are amazed at the quality of work our dedicated staff produce in such limited space. The teams patience and persistence will soon be rewarded. Building plans are now complete and we hope to move into the new facility to be located at the rear of Monash Medical Centre in mid 1998.<BR>
    The Institute thanks all our generous donors for their support and looks forward to support from other members of our community to reach our target.

<CENTER><IMG  ALT="NH&MRC Support Men's Health Research at IRD" SRC="headlin2.gif"></CENTER><P>
<STRONG>The Institute of Reproduction & Development was recently awarded a major program grant worth close to five million dollars to continue its vital research into mens health.</STRONG><BR>
The National Health and Medical Research Council (NH&MRC) will provide $980,000 per year for the next five years to the Institute of Reproduction and Development to conduct much needed research into prostate disease, prostate cancer and testicular cancer.<BR>
The grant was awarded to David de Kretser, Gail Risbridger and Mark Hedger from the Institute and to Milton Hearn (Biochemistry) and Graham Jenkin (Physiology).  It emphasises the value of collaborative research to solve the complex biomedical research problems that confront us today, said Professor de Kretser, Institute Director and head of this project.<BR>
Greater understanding of the activities and changes that occur in the prostate and the testis, may also lead to potential treatments for male infertility and the development of a male contraceptive. <BR>
This funding will enable us to have both continuity and flexibility in our research, Professor de Kretser explained.<BR>
The Institute also received two more grants from the NH&MRC this year. Approximately $147,000 over three years was awarded to Malcolm Wilkinson, Philip Berger and Andrew Ramsden to continue their research into breathing disorders of babies during sleep.<BR>  
A further $55,000 per year for the next three years has been granted to Denis Engler & Ismail Kola to further the work on gene knockouts which will lead to greater understanding of disorders such as Downs syndrome and Alzheimers.

<CENTER><IMG  ALT="Grisha Sklovsky Memorial Scholarship Awarded" SRC="headlin3.gif"></CENTER><P>
<STRONG>The inaugural Grisha Sklovsky Memorial Scholarship has been awarded to Ms Kathleen Brasher, a PhD student in the Department of Paediatrics who is reviewing the impact on parents of an apnoea in their infant.  Apnoea is a temporary cessation of breathing quite common in new born babies during sleep and closely linked to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.</STRONG><BR>  
An experienced nurse and midwife, Ms Brasher was the co-ordinator of the Paediatrics Home Monitoring Program for many years.  This program provides a vital service to families who may be predisposed to SIDS.  Apnoea monitors which will sound when the baby stops breathing are often supplied for these infants.  University and hospital staff also counsel the parents where necessary.<BR>
After years of working with these families Ms Brasher realised that they were a group about whom very little was known.  She elected to undertake this much need research as a full-time PhD student at the beginning of this year.  Her study will be involve many in depth interviews with parents to ascertain what the apnoea in their infants means to them and how it has impacted on their relationship and approach to the child.<BR>
For the parents an apnoea can be a trauma similar to that of a physical accident, said Ms Brasher.<BR>
From the study we hope to determine ways of improving our services to these parents and also highlight the elements of the program that are already working well, she said.<BR>
The Grisha Sklovsky Memorial Scholarship was established to honour the life and work of the inaugural chair of the Institutes Management Advisory Board.  Dr Sklovsky was a strong supporter of the Institutes work and we are pleased to be able to honour him in this way.  Ms Brasher met with members of the Sklovsky family to explain her work on the evening of Thursday, 7 November.<BR>
At this stage the funds available will only enable us to provide the award once every three years, as a student takes a minimum of three years to complete a PhD.  Further donations to this fund would be sincerely appreciated and may enable us to make this an annual award.<P>

The ATV Awards are considered prestigious in advertising circles and Nine and a half months was selected against considerable competition.  The judging panel consists of a selected panel of top Australian advertising creative people whose task is to determine if any entry is worthy of the award.  Many categories do not have any winners.<BR>

<CENTER><IMG  ALT="Medical Students' efforts to raise prostate disease awareness wins award" SRC="headlin5.gif"></CENTER><P>
<STRONG>Prostate Disease is a serious health issue about which there is still much confusion, says Brendan Thomas, 3rd year medical student at Monash University.  We discovered that many men do not recognise the symptoms and if they do they are not willing to go to the doctor.</STRONG><BR>
Brendan and three of his colleagues, Dominic Hannan, Ian Letson and Tuan Phan recently won the VicHealth Foundations award for Outstanding Achievement in the Area of Health Promotion for a Prostate Disease Awareness Campaign they conducted in August and September of this year.<BR>
Their multi-faceted promotional program was designed to not only raise awareness, understanding and appreciation of prostate disease, but also to motivate people to look after this important aspect of their health and provide them with the information necessary to do so.<BR>
Central to the campaign was a public seminar held at Monash Medical Centre on 12 September. Good Morning Australia, The Age and The Herald Sun, as well as several community newspapers and radio programs advertised the seminar free of charge and at the same time ran stories on prostate disease.  Invitations to the seminar were  posted to over 170 RSL and Probus clubs and were distributed to other interested parties via the Internet.<BR>
A series of pamphlets on prostate disease were also available for the 300+ seminar participants. For those unable to attend the students prepared an extensive home page on the world wide web which covered the subject in great detail.  It can still be seen at:  http://www.monash.edu.au/health/pamphlets/prostate.<BR>
The students drew on a number of sources for information on prostate.  The Institute of Reproduction and Development was pleased to assist such a professionally conducted program.  We congratulate the students on their achievements.

<CENTER><IMG  ALT="The causes of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome: a great Scientific Challenge" SRC="headlin6.gif"></CENTER><P>
<STRONG>Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a serious disease which affects about 23% of women.  More than 50% of female infertility problems due to a failure to ovulate is attributed to this disease.  In addition to infertility problems, symptoms include hormonal disorders and enlarged ovaries with cysts.  During the last sixty years, a considerable effort has been dedicated to the investigation of PCOS.  However, the causes of the syndrome is still unknown.</STRONG><BR>
In accordance with the Institute mission, to promote research to benefit the reproductive health of women and men, a dedicated research program has been established in this area, headed by Ghanim Almahbobi and Alan Trounson.  Our aim is to understand the role of abnormal function of intraovarian regulators in the causes of this disease. The research has attracted an NH&MRC grant and Monash IVF support.  Several significant international scientific journals have published articles on the research and Institute staff member,Ghanim Almahbobi, has presented the results to date at international conferences. Part of this work was recognised by an award of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE). <BR>
The program is currently expanding, as Masters student, Aileen Misajon, and overseas visiting scientist, Dr X Yan, have now joined the project.  It is hoped that the project will also attract further external funds which will assist consolidate the program, at the Institute.

After completing her MBBS at the University of Melbourne and working for several years in the public hospital system, Sue Chapman commenced the Advanced Trainee in Urology program at Ballarat Base Hospital at the beginning of last year.  
</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>
After one year in this program she interrupted her clinical training and came to the Institute where she began investigating the role of growth factors in the prostate.  In conjunction with other members of Dr Risbridgers research team, Dr Chapman was particularly looking at the role of the hormones inhibin and activin in the development of prostate cancer.<BR>
In parallel to her laboratory research, Dr Chapman was also involved in an epidemiological study in Ballarat.  By endeavouring to follow up approximately 1300 prostate cancer patients who attended Ballarat Base Hospital between 1980-1995, she is reviewing the morbidity and mortality of a watchful waiting approach to prostate cancer.<BR>
These two projects have complimented each other extremely well, said Dr Chapman. Firstly I have been looking at the development and reasons for prostate cancer growth.  The second study has involved working at the next stage - the treatment of prostate cancer.  The two are obviously related.<BR>
If new techniques are to be developed, clinicians as well as scientists need to be involved in basic research, she said.  This is the key to coming up with a different approach to the treatment of prostate cancer.<BR>
This year has certainly changed Dr Chapmans perspective on research and provided a level of understanding of prostate disease that she would not have obtained otherwise.  The Institute is thrilled to be able to interact with the urology community in this way.<BR>
Dr Chapman will continue her urology training next year in Perth where she hopes to keep in touch with research.

<STRONG>Finn, the first calf conceived in Australia using nuclear transfer techniques, was born in June this year at Genetics Australias artificial breeding centre at Bacchus Marsh, thanks largely to the research of the Institute of Reproduction & Development.</STRONG><BR>
Finns birth is the result of a collaborative research project run by the Institute and Genetics Australia.  The project aims to produce genetically identical animals by applying nuclear transfer and embryo multiplication techniques.  The project has a budget of $1.6 million over three years and is funded by the Dairy Research and Development Corporation, the Meat Research Corporation and Genetics Australia.<BR>
Dr Teija Peura, who heads the Institutes embryo biotechnology section, explained that nuclear transfer involves separating 30 to 50 cell embryos into individual cells.  These are then fused into unfertilised eggs from which the nuclear material (the chromosomes) has been removed. <BR> 
Each of the 30 to 50 cells of the original embryo has the potential to form a new embryo, resulting in a number of embryos which will be genetically identical, said Dr Peura.  Some of the techniques developed at Monash are unique and have been patented.<BR>
Following Finns successful delivery, several more calves produced by nuclear transfer will be born later this year. <BR> 
Mr John Owens, manager of Genetics Australias embryo programs, said that the project had a large potential benefit for Australias cattle industry.  Of course, a lot more research, probably over many years, is required to be able to produce genetically identical livestock for the commercial market, he said.  While research is painstaking, and sometimes frustrating, the partnership between Genetics Australia and the Institute combines high calibre scientific expertise with a sharp commercial focus.

<STRONG>The Institutes 1996 annual symposium on Advances in Perinatal Medicine & Sciences:  Development of Crucial Organ Systems, attracted numerous world experts on the care and treatment of newborn and premature babies.  Over 100 scientists and health professionals registered for the conference which ran from 2 - 4 October at Monash Medical Centre.</STRONG><BR>
Guests at the symposium included Prof Sam Hawgood from San Francisco, the world leader on lung surfactant, a vital component of treatment for the premature baby.  Dr John Wyatt from London reviewed the latest in assessment and prevention of brain injury in the fetus.  Obstetrician, Dr Kathryn Reed also made the trip from Tucson in the United States to discuss fetal heart assessment using special ultrasound technology.  <BR>
Institute researchers, including Assoc Prof Walker and Dr Philip Berger from the Fetal Physiology Group, and Prof Victor Yu and Dr Andrew Ramsden from Neonatal Intensive Care also contributed to the high quality program.<BR>
We were pleased to see representatives from all the major perinatal units in Australia attending the conference, said Associate Professor Adrian Walker, conference convenor and Associate Director of the Institute. Registrants also came from Singapore, Malaysia, Japan and New Zealand.<BR>
By bringing together the leaders in perinatal medicine in the Asia Pacific Region and beyond, the conference proved to be an ideal forum for discussions on the future direction of research in this field.  It is hoped that some research collaborations will eventuate, said Associate Professor Walker.<BR>
The conference organising committee would like to convey their thanks to the symposium sponsors, particular major sponsor Abbott Australasia, for their generous support of this event.

<STRONG>In February 1995 Dr Stefan Schlatt from the Institute of Reproductive Medicine in Mnster, Germany came to Monash to gain more insight into spermatogonia, testicular stem cells.  His visit is sponsored by the German Research Foundation and the Institute of Reproduction and Development is proud to have been selected to assist this young scientists career.
</STRONG><BR>
As Dr Schlatt, approaches the end of his two year collaboration with our Institute he believes he has benefited significantly from working in such an active group where such a variety of research into reproduction is taking place.<BR>
I look forward to implementing in Mnster some of the methodology I have learned and developed here, explains Dr Schlatt.  The Institute has been a stimulating place to work and I hope that I have been able to provide my colleagues in Melbourne with some intellectual input.<BR>
During his stay Dr Schlatt has worked with many members of the Institute staff particularly Dr Mark Hedger and Dr Kate Loveland.  He has been analysing the effects of different hormones, particularly androgens, FSH and thyroxine, on the growth and development of cells in the testis after birth, and has developed a cell culture system and other techniques to enable monitoring changes in Sertoli cells.<BR>
It is hoped that increased knowledge in this component of the male reproductive system will in the long term lead to the development of new male contraceptive strategies and provide greater understanding of causes of male infertility.<BR>
Australia is a very friendly country and my wife Klara and I are pleased that part of the upbringing of our three children, Lukas, Jakob and Ferdinand, could take place in such a positive environment,  Dr Schlatt adds.  I also thank Klara for her support of my scientific work.

Tilbrook AJ, <STRONG>de Kretser DM</STRONG>, Dunshea FR, Klein R, Robertson, DM, Clarke IJ & Maddocks S (1996) The testis is not the major source of circulating follistatin in the ram. <EM>Journal Endocrinology</EM> <STRONG>149</STRONG>: 55-63.
<P>
The aims of this study were to determine the plasma
          concentrations of follistatin in rams and to assess if the
          testis contributes to circulating follistatin and if there
          is uptake or production of follistatin by the head in rams.
          Catheters were inserted in the carotid artery, jugular vein
          and spermatic vein of intact rams during the non-breeding
          season (experiment 1; n=5) and breeding season (experiment
          2; n=4). In experiment 1, blood samples were collected from
          5 rams every 10 min for 4 h, commencing 20-60 min after
          surgery. After 2 h of sampling 1 mu g
          gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) was injected
          intravenously. In experiment 2, blood samples were
          collected from 4 of the rams used in experiment 1 by
          venipuncture 30 and 15 min before surgery and every 15 min
          throughout surgery. Commencing 1 h after surgery, matched
          samples were taken from each of the vessels every 10 min
          for 4 h (1-4 h after surgery), then every hour for 20 h
          (4-24 h after surgery) and then every 10 min for 4 h (24-28
          h after surgery). In both experiments, follistatin
          secretion was non-pulsatile and there were no significant
          differences between the concentrations of follistatin in
          any of the vessels. There was a significant (P<0.05)
          increase in the concentrations of follistatin in each of
          the vessels throughout the 4 h of 10-min sampling in both
          experiments. In experiment 2 plasma concentrations of
          follistatin in the jugular vein were significantly (P<0.05)
          lower before surgery than at other stages of the
          experiment. During the non-breeding season (experiment 1)
          the concentrations of follistatin in all vessels were about
          2-fold higher (P<0.001) than during the breeding season
          (experiment 2). Concentrations of follistatin were measured
          in the testicular tissue of the ram, bull, monkey and rat
          and were found to be 13.6, 2.1, 2.5, 0.8 ng/g testis
          respectively. In experiment 3, blood samples were collected
          every 15 min for 4 h from castrated rams (n=6) in the
          absence of treatment with testosterone propionate (TP) and
          after 7 days of treatment with a physiological dose of TP
          during the breeding and non-breeding seasons. There was no
          effect of stage of breeding season or TP on the plasma
          concentrations of follistatin and these concentrations in
          the castrated rams were similar to the concentrations in
          the intact rams in experiment 2. In experiment 4, the
          function of Leydig cells was stimulated by administration
          of human chorionic gonadotrophin but this had no effect on
          plasma concentrations of follistatin.<P>
          These experiments show that the concentrations of
          follistatin in the plasma of rams are measurable, that the
          testis is not the major contributor to circulating
          follistatin and that there is no significant uptake or
          production of follistatin by the head in rams. It appears
          that the contribution of the testis to circulating
          follistatin may vary with the stage of the breeding season,
          being greater during the non-breeding season than the
          breeding season. The gonadotrophins and testosterone do not
          appear to have a direct effect on the secretion of
          follistatin in rams. The increase in concentrations of
          circulating follistatin during surgery and more frequent
          blood sampling suggest a stress-related effect on the
          production of follistatin.

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), described originally as a product of activated T lymphocytes, recently has been found to be released by monocytes/macrophages and the anterior pituitary gland. Immunohistochemical studies of the adult rat testis using an affinity-purified polyclonal antimurine MIF antibody demonstrated strong staining for MIF in Leydig cells and          their putative precursors. Peritubular myoid cells and the seminiferous epithelium were negative for MIF staining; however, a weak reaction around the heads of elongated spermatids also was observed. The expression of MIF messenger RNA and protein in whole rat testis was demonstrated by Northern blot and Western blot analyses, respectively. Both MIF messenger RNA and protein       immunoreactivity in Leydig cells was observed in testes obtained from long term hypophysectomized rats. Significant oncentrations of intracellular MIF were detected in lysates of the TM3 Leydig cell line (7.23 +/- 2.6 pg/mu g protein), and testicular interstitial fluid contained 14.7 +/- 1.6 ng/ml MIF protein, as measured by MIF-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To gain insight into the    possible biological role of MIF in the testis, cultures of adult rat seminiferous tubules and purified Leydig cells were incubated together with recombinant murine MIF (rMIF). Neither rMIF (50 ng/ml) nor a neutralizing anti-MIF antiserum was found to affect basal or LH-stimulated Leydig cell steroidogenesis in vitro. However, a dose-dependent decrease in the secretion of inhibin by the seminiferous tubules was observed at rMIF concentrations ranging from 10-100 ng/ml. Taken together, these data indicate that Leydig cells produce MIF in vivo and suggest an important          regulatory role for this newly discovered mediator of testicular function.

In this study, adult male rats were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of serotonin 
(5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT; 10 mg kg(-1) bodyweight) for 2 h or 18 h, or daily with graded
doses of 5HT (0.1-10 mg kg(-1)) for four days before being killed. Serum and testicular
interstitial fluid (IF) concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone 
(FSH), testosterone and immunoreactive-inhibin were measured by radioimmunoassay, and
one testis was removed for histological examination. At 2 h after a single injection, 5HT
caused a significant inhibition of serum concentrations of LH and inhibin, recovered IF
volume and intratesticular testosterone concentrations; testis weight and serum concentrations
of testosterone and FSH were unaffected. At Is h after injection, all parameters had returned
to normal, with the exception of intratesticular testosterone concentration which remained
lower than normal. The lowest 5HT dose (0.1 mg kg(-1)) had no effect on any parameter
following four daily injections. At a dose of 1.0 mg kg(-1) 5HT, there was a four-fold
increase in the concentration of serum LH, but testis weight, recovered IF volume,
testosterone and inhibin concentrations and serum concentrations of FSH were not
significantly affected. At the highest dose of 5HT (10 mg kg(-1)) after four daily injections,
testis weight decreased, and IF volume increased nearly three-fold. Testis concentrations of 
inhibin and serum testosterone were reduced, whereas serum concentrations of both LH and
FSH were elevated; intratesticular testosterone concentrations did not differ from controls.
Only at the highest dose of 5HT was disruption to the seminiferous epithelium observed, with 
focal damage ranging in severity from increased degeneration of spermatogenic cell profiles,
to complete loss of the germinal epithelium; however, many tubule profiles displayed
completely normal spermatogenesis. The acute IF volume reduction and spermatogenic
disruption in 5HT-treated rats were consistent with localized ischaemia due to constriction of
the testicular arterial supply. The eventual increase in IF volume observed after 5HT treatment 
appeared to be secondary to the loss of germ cells. Although 5HT also inhibited pituitary LH
release and Leydig cell steroidogenesis, these effects appeared to play only a minor role in
the induction of spermatogenic damage.

The relative capacities for testicular macrophages and  resident peritoneal macrophages to secrete the        pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 1 (IL-1), in response to stimulation by bacterial lipopolysaccharide          (LPS), were compared in vitro. Macrophages were isolated from adult male rat testicular interstitial cells or          peritoneal ravage by adherence to glass coverslips or plastic culture dishes. The macrophages were immediately cultured, with or without a maximal dose of LPS (1 microgram/ml), over 24 hours at 32 degrees C. Bioactive IL-1 production was measured by a sensitive thymocyte  proliferation bioassay, employing recombinant human IL-1 beta as the reference standard. In comparison with the peritoneal macrophages, testicular macrophages displayed  only a very small response to LPS, producing 2.8% of the  amount of IL-1 per cell secreted by peritoneal macrophages cultured under identical conditions. Production of authentic IL-1 was confirmed by inhibition of the bioassay response in the presence of human recombinant IL-1 receptor          antagonist. A small molecular mass (<10 kDa based on ultrafiltration) inhibitor of IL-1 bioactivity was also          present in the medium collected from both cultures, but this inhibitory activity did not account for the          differences in activity observed. In cultures of total peritoneal cells under similar conditions, addition of          testosterone (10-1,000 ng/ml) did not affect IL-1production in response to LPS. These data indicate that          testicular macrophages have a reduced ability to secrete bioactive IL-1, and they provide further evidence for
an  altered capacity for immune responses within the testis.

 Initial studies on inhibin, activin and follistatin focussed on their role as regulators of adult
gonadal function via feedback regulation of anterior pituitary hormones and via intragonadal
control of steroid hormones. The discovery of isoforms of follistatin which are either secreted
or retained on the cell surface and which bind activin and, to a lesser extent, inhibin adds a
further dimension to the regulation of these peptides. More recently, the cloning of inhibin
and activin, and the observation of their close homology to the transforming growth
factor-beta family of peptides, has led to an interest in their possible role as growth and 
differentiation factors.   Activin, inhibin and follistatin are expressed in embryonic and fetal
tissues, as well as in the placenta. However, although activin is a potent regulator of growth
and differentiation in a number of cell types, their role in embryonic and fetal development
has yet to be established. High concentrations of inhibin have been observed in the fetal
gonads, particularly the testes, and in the fetal adrenals of a number of species and a sex
difference in fetal plasma concentrations has also been observed. Although the stimulus for
high concentrations of inhibin in the fetus is not know, they are associated with decreased
testicular testosterone and a decrease in the concentration of circulating follicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH); this suggests that, as in the adult, inhibin may be involved in the regulation
of fetal testicular androgen and pituitary FSH secretion during late gestation. The recent
reports of elevated concentrations of inhibin and, particularly, activin in amniotic fluid during
late gestation and its ability to stimulate the production of prostaglandin E(2) by fetal
membranes provides yet another potential role for this hormone in the regulation of events
leading to parturition.

 Inhibin, activin and follistatin are protein hormones with diverse physiological roles. The
involvement of inhibin in the regulation of pituitary FSH production and secretion in adult
males and non-pregnant females is well established. However, it is unlikely that inhibin plays
a similar role in pregnancy in ruminants. Inhibin and activin molecules show a high degree
of structural similarity to potent growth and differentiation factors of the transforming growth
factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of peptides and their localization in a range of embryonic
and fetal tissues indicates that they may thus play a role in development. Furthermore, the
demonstration that follistatin is also present in a number of embryonic and fetal tissues and
fluids has further implications for the actions of activin to which it binds. The role of inhibin,
activin and follistatin in early development has yet to be established since gene knockout
experiments have so far proved inconclusive. During mid- and late gestation, high
concentrations of inhibin are found in the testes and plasma of male fetuses of sheep and
cattle. Inhibin may play a role in regulating pituitary FSH release in late pregnancy, but the
very high concentrations of this hormone in ovine fetal testes and in male fetal plasma
compared with that observed in the fetal ovary and female fetal plasma has yet to be
explained. The recent observation of high concentrations of inhibin, activin and follistatin in
amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus is intriguing. Excretion via urine or lung liquid is partly
responsible for the presence of these proteins in amniotic fluid. The fetal membranes and the
placenta are also possible sources. It remains to be established whether these proteins
constitute an inactive pool of secreted hormone or whether they have other actions in this
fetal compartment.

Activin, a dimer of the beta-subunits of inhibin, is a
          member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)
          superfamily of growth factors and has a widespread range of
          actions in a variety of tissues. The investigation of the
          physiology of activin action has been facilitated in recent
          years by the availability of immunoassays in addition to
          bioassays, Follistatin has been shown to bind to activin
          with a high affinity and therefore interferes in both
          radioimmunoassays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
          (ELISAs). In this study we examined the effect of various
          surfactants and 1,4-dioxane on the measurement of activin
          in the presence of follistatin by radioimmunoassay. The
          addition of a combination of sodium deoxycholate, Tween 20
          and sodium dodecyl sulphate removed the interference of
          follistatin in the radioimmunoassay. The measured content
          of activin in male rat serum, human male serum, human
          female serum and bovine follicular fluid rose from 3.29 to
          4.15, < 0.48 to 2.87, 2.42 to 4.17 and 30.9 to 85.6 ng/ml.
          respectively, when assayed in the presence of the
          dissociating reagents, It was unclear whether the altered
          potencies were due to a dissociation of the
          follistatin/activin complex rather than the exposure of the
          epitope on activin recognized by the antiserum. Serum
          concentrations of activin were lower than those found in
          testicular cytosols, and after castration no change in
          serum activin levels was observed, suggesting that the
          testis does not contribute significantly to circulating
          activin levels, The use of the dissociating reagents in the
          radioimmunoassay will enable studies to be carried out that
          more accurately measure the activin content of various
          biological fluids, and thus lead to a greater understanding
          of the physiology of this growth factor.

 The expression of mRNAs encoding the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) subunits
(PDGF A and PDGF B) and the PDGF receptor subunits (PDGF-R alpha and PDGF-R beta)
was studied in cells of the rat testis. Leydig cells, primary spermatocytes, round spermatids,
and cytoplasts were isolated from adult animals, and enriched preparations of Sertoli cells
were obtained from 20-day-old animals. RNA from these cells was examined using Northern
blots. Messenger RNA encoding both the PDGF-R alpha and PDGF-R beta subunits was
observed in Leydig and Sertoli cell preparations but not in any of the germ cell samples. The
Leydig cells contained predominantly mRNA encoding PDGF B subunits, while the Sertoli
cells contained abundant mRNAs encoding both ligand subunits. Neither PDGF subunit
mRNA was detected in the germ cells. This paper has not examined the expression of protein
corresponding to the mRNAs detected but the data suggest that both paracrine and autocrine
roles for PDGF are likely in the testis, and that PDGF may mediate communication between
the interstitial compartment and the seminiferous epithelium.

The testis is one of the most abundant sources of microtubule networks. These networks
include mitotic and meiotic spindles, the spermatid manchette and axoneme, and  the Sertoli
cell cytoskeleton. Microtubules are composed of alpha- and beta-tubulin subunits that are
polymerized and stabilized by a variety of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). One of
these, MAP2, has been extensively characterized as a brain-specific protein with the capacity
to bind tubulin, cAMP-dependent kinase, and calmodulin. MAP2 mRNA is processed into at
least two variants encoding proteins designated MAP2a, MAP2b, and MAP2c. Of the 5.7 kb
of coding sequence in the 9-kb mRNA that encodes MAP2a and MAP2b, a deletion of
approximately 4 kb produces mRNA encoding MAP2c, which consists of only the N- and
C-terminal regions of MAP2b. To determine whether MAP2 was present in the rat testis,
microtubule preparations were isolated from adult rat testis and brain by means of
taxol-mediated polymerization and analyzed by gel filtration, ELISA, and Western blotting
using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies reactive with MAP2. A 74-kDa protein
corresponding to MAP2c was detected in the testis. These results were confirmed by Northern
blot analysis of total RNA from adult rat brain and testis with cDNA probes that distinguish
between the known MAP2 splice variants. The predominant mRNAs in testis of 6 kb and
2.5-3.5 kb corresponded to MAP2c. A single 6-kb mRNA with the potential to encode
MAP2c was detected in enriched preparations of immature Sertoli cells and adult Leydig 
cells, Round spermatids contained at least two MAP2 mRNAs between approximately 2.5 and
3.5 kb in size that displayed a stage-specific pattern of expression. Immunohistochemistry
showed a MAP2-like protein in both somatic and germ cells, with a particularly distinct 
localization within the cytoplasm of primary and secondary spermatocytes at stage XIV of the
seminiferous cycle during meiotic metaphase. In addition to cytoplasmic staining, a novel
localization of this protein was observed in the nucleus of many testicular cells.

          caput and cauda epididymis, and adult and day-15 testis and
          adult spleen, while adult liver contained a single

   Rat sperm tail fibrous sheath was isolated using mechanical and chemical dissection
methods from spermatozoa collected from the cauda epididymis. The procedures used to
isolate the fibrous sheath were monitored by phase-contrast microscopy and purity was
verified by electron microscopy. SDS-PAGE of isolated total fibrous sheath revealed at least
17 bands when stained with Coomassie brilliant blue and 20 bands with silver stain. The most
intensely staining proteins, using both staining methods, were a double band at 80-87 kDa,
and a band at 28.5 kDa, whereas with silver staining, bands at 66.2 kDa and 32.7 kDa were
also intensely stained. Electroelution following SDS-PAGE was used to isolate II of these
proteins (116.4, 87.5, 80.9, 66.2, 57.2, 49.7, 46.8, 37.3, 32.7, 28.5 and 15.5 kDa). Amino acid
analysis revealed that these proteins were abundant in aspartic and glutamic acid, glycine,
serine and leucine, while histidine and phenylalanine were of low abundance. The content of
cystine varied widely from 9.4% to 1.4%. The amino termini of the 80.9 kDa, 32.7 kDa, 28.5
kDa and 15.5 kDa proteins were blocked. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that
a polyclonal antiserum to isolated rat fibrous sheath was localized to the principal piece of
the rat, rabbit and human spermatozoa, but in the rabbit it also labelled the equatorial region
of the head. Western blotting detected all protein bands in isolated fibrous sheath and a
similar range of proteins in the spermatozoa of rat and rabbit. Human sperm proteins of 116
kDa and 80 kDa were immunoreactive in common with other species, and there was only
weak crossreactivity with the other proteins. These data suggest the presence of common
epitopes in the proteins of all three species.

<P>

Androgen production by adult rat Leydig cells is stimulated
          by pituitary LH but can also be modulated in vitro by
          paracrine stimulatory and inhibitory factors, many of which
          belong to growth factor families, Their actions are
          mediated tl?rough cell surface or extracellular matrix
          proteoglycans and the aim of this study was to determine
          the role of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans in
          the regulation of testosterone secretion by adult rat
          Leydig cells. The presence of sodium chlorate (25 mM) and
          protamine sulfate (10 mu g/ml) inhibited testosterone
          production by LII stimulated cells by over 50%, but had no
          effect on unstimulated cells. The LH responsiveness and
          testosterone production returned to normal after these
          agents were removed from the culture media. No significant
          difference in LH receptor numbers al the end of the culture
          period was seen between sodium chlorate treated and
          untreated cells. Testosterone production by dibutryl-cAMP
          stimulated Leydig cells was also inhibited by sodium
          chlorate. The addition of heparin inhibited testosterone
          production by LH stimulated cells in a dose-dependent
          manner, however, in unstimulated Leydig cells heparin
          stimulated testosterone production to up to 50% of that
          seen in LH stimulated cells. These data suggest that cell
          surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans modulate testosterone
          production by adult Leydig cells in vitro, and that this
          may involve the autocrine actions of heparin binding growth
          factors on the Leydig cells.

Meachem SJ, McLachlan RI, <STRONG>de Kretser DM</STRONG>, Robertson DM & <STRONG>Wreford NG</STRONG> (1996)  Neonatal exposure of rats to recombinant follicle stimulating hormone increases adult Sertoli and spermatogenic cell numbers. <EM> Biology of Reproduction </EM><STRONG>  54</STRONG>: 34-44.
<P>
  It is believed that Sertoli cells support a finite number
          of germ cells and that Sertoli cell number may help
          determine the spermatogenic capacity of the adult. In the
          rat, Sertoli cells divide during fetal and early postnatal
          life, a process controlled in part by FSH. This study
          examined the effect of recombinant human FSH on postnatal
          testicular development and the impact of neonatal FSH
          exposure on the adult animal. Sprague-Dawley rats received
          FSH (200 IU/kg s.c.) daily from birth (Day 1) until Day 5,
          10, 15, and 20. In a second experiment, animals received
          FSH for the first 10 or 15 days of life and were killed at
          Day 90. Sertoli and spermatogenic cell numbers were
          determined by stereological methods (the optical disector
          technique). FSH treatment significantly (p < 0.001)
          increased testicular weights (135%, 193%, and 173% of
          controls at Days 10, 15, and 20, respectively). The
          absolute volume of the epithelium and interstitium
          increased significantly as a result of increases in tubule
          diameter and length. In response to FSH treatment, the
          number of Sertoli cells increased significantly (p < 0.01)
          to 168%, 139%, and 151% of control numbers at Days 10, 15,
          and 20, respectively. After 15 days of FSH treatment, the
          numbers of spermatogonia and spermatocytes also increased
          (169% and 220% of control, p < 0.01, p < 0.001,
          respectively). The labeling index of Sertoli cell nuclei,
          as determined by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, was
          unaffected by FSH treatment, with cessation of Sertoli cell
          division occurring as normal at Day 15. FSH treatment for
          the first 10 or 15 days of neonatal life resulted in
          testicular hypertrophy in adulthood (testis weight 118% and
          124% of control, respectively). Similar increases were seen
          in the absolute volume of seminiferous epithelium and
          lumen, which were attributed to an increase in tubule
          length. Sertoli cell numbers increased to 118% and 149% of
          control after 10 and 15 days, respectively, of FSH
          exposure, with similar increases in round and elongated
          spermatid numbers. We conclude that exposure of the
          neonatal rat to recombinant FSH results in testicular
          hypertrophy with increases in seminiferous tubule volume
          and length and proportionate increases in Sertoli and germ
          cell numbers. This trophic effect of increased perinatal
          FSH exposure persists into adulthood to augment the
          spermatogenic potential of the rat.

Testosterone (T) has been shown to be essential for the completion of spermiogenesis. Our previous studies showed
          that when intratesticular T was suppressed for 11 wk, the
          conversion of round spermatids between stages VII and VIII
          of the spermatogenic cycle was markedly suppressed and that
          elongated spermatids were undetectable. The fate of the
          round spermatids that did not proceed through this
          conversion was unclear. The current study aimed to
          investigate this T-dependent loss of round spermatids
          during stages VII and VIII. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats
          received 24-cm T implants for 1 wk to suppress LH while
          maintaining spermatogenesis. The T24 implants were removed
          and replaced with 3-cm T plus 0.4-cm estradiol CTE
          treatment) to suppress intratesticular T and
          spermatogenesis, and animals were killed at 0 and 4 days
          and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 wk later. The number of
          homogenization-resistant elongated spermatids in the testis
          was counted, and round spermatid populations in stages VII
          and VIII were quantified using stereological techniques.
          The hourly production rates (HPR) were calculated, and a
          ratio was made between the HPR of round spermatids in
          stages VII and VIII to assess the efficiency of their
          conversion through these stages. Testicular T levels were
          suppressed to 2-4% of control values by TE treatment. After
          2 wk of TE treatment, the number of
          homogenization-resistant elongated spermatids was
          significantly suppressed, falling to < 0.5% of the control
          value by 6 wk. The HPR of round spermatids in stages VII
          and VIII was not affected by up to 2 wk of TE treatment,
          nor was the conversion between these stages interrupted.
          After 3 wk of TE treatment, the HPR of round spermatids in
          stages VII and VIII was significantly suppressed, as was
          the conversion between these stages, the ratio falling to
          27% of the control value by 6 wk. In rats treated with TE,
          histological examination of the cauda epididymidis showed
         occasional round spermatids after 3 wk of treatment, and
          large numbers after 6 wk. We conclude that the failure of
          round spermatids to complete spermiogenesis following T
          withdrawal is due to stage-specific detachment of round
          spermatids between stages VII and VIII.

Plasma follistatin (FS) concentrations were determined after castration (n=5) or sham castration (n=4) of mature rams. Both treatments resulted in a prolonged increase in FS between 7 and 19 h after surgery, which returned to pretreatment concentrations by 24 h. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a sensitive marker of an acute-phase response, was undetectable in plasma, indicating that the FS response was not induced by trauma due to surgery. In a second experiment, injection of         castrated rams (n=4) with ovine recombinant interleukin-1 beta, an acute-phase mediator, resulted in a sustained rise in FS concentrations within 4 h of injection. Plasma TNF-alpha concentrations increased transiently within 1 h of interleukin-1 beta injection, indicating that an acute-phase response had been initiated. Plasma follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations were significantly decreased at 8 and 24 h after interleukin-1 beta injection, strongly suggestive of an inhibitory effect     of increased FS concentrations on the secretion of FSH. Injection of castrated rams (n=2) with a control preparation of recombinant interleukin-2 did not induce an acute-phase response, and plasma FS and FSH concentrations were unaffected. These data show that the testis is not a major source of circulating FS, that the increase in circulating FS following sham castration/castration is not due to an acute-phase response, but that conversely FS concentrations are modulated by the acute-phase mediator, interleukin-1 beta.

A new methodological approach using immunohistochemical
          markers for Sertoli cells (alpha inhibin), peritubular
          cells (alpha smooth muscle actin), and S-phase cells
          (bromodeoxyuridine; BrdU) is presented that allows an
          accurate and simultaneous analysis of morphogenetic and
          mitogenic changes occurring in vitro. Sertoli cells and
          peritubular cells were isolated by sequential enzymatic
          digestion from 7-day-old rats. Laminin, as a major
          component of the extracellular matrix of the seminiferous
          tubule, and FSH, as a hormone stimulating Sertoli cell
          proliferation, were tested for their ability to influence
          the morphology or mitotic activity of the cultured cells.
          After fixation, the coverslips were stained for these
          antigens with use of specific primary antibodies and
          horseradish peroxidase- or alkaline phosphatase-labeled
          secondary antibodies for visualization of the respective
          antigens with different-colored precipitates. This approach
          allowed us to distinguish the two cell populations, which
          could not be done unequivocally without the antibody
          staining. We scored striking changes in cell densities and
          cell ratios during the culture period. Peritubular cells
          showed a consistently higher BrdU-labeling index than
          Sertoli cells. While Sertoli cells were not labeled until
          Day 7, peritubular cells proliferated as soon as on Day 3,
          and their density doubled from Day 3 to Day 7. A linear
          negative correlation was established for Sertoli cell
          proliferation in response to their local density on the
          coverslip, indicating contact inhibition as a signal for
          cessation of mitosis. At high cell densities, this
          inhibition was partially overcome in the presence of FSH.
          The presence of laminin had striking effects on the
          morphogenetic response but only a minor influence on
          mitogenesis.

   The combined effects of transient neonatal hypothyroidism and neonatal hemicastration
were investigated to see whether they were additive. Hypothyroidism was induced in litters
of ten male rats for 25 days from the day of birth by administration of 0.1% (w/v)
6-propyl-2-thiouracil in the mother's drinking water; hemicastration was performed on the day
of birth. Controls included both normal and sham-operated animals. Numbers of Sertoli cells
and round spermatids were quantified at age 135 days using stereological methods.
Sham-operation had no effect on testis mass, or numbers of Sertoli or germ cells. Transient
neonatal hypothyroidism resulted in an increase in testicular mass of 27% (P < 0.05), whereas
neonatal hemicastration resulted in a 33% (P < 0.05) increase over control; the combination
of the two procedures resulted in a 62% (P < 0.05) increase. There were corresponding
significant increases in the number of Sertoli cells: 82% with hypothyroidism, 18% with
hemicastration and 123% with the combination of the two procedures. Numbers of round
spermatids showed similar increases: 59% with hypothyroidism, 45% with hemicastration and
95% with the combination of the two procedures. It is concluded that the effects of the
combination of transient neonatal hypothyroidism and hemicastration are additive with respect
to testicular mass, and numbers of Sertoli and germ cells.

Najmabadi H,  Huang V,  Yen P,  Subbarao MN,  Bhasin D,  Banaag L,  Naseeruddin S, <STRONG>de Kretser DM</STRONG>,  Baker HWG, McLachlan RI,  <STRONG>Loveland KA</STRONG> &  Bhasin S (1996) Substantial prevalence of microdeletions of the Y-chromosome in infertile men with idiopathic azoospermia and oligozoospermia detected with a sequence-tagged site-based mapping strategy. <EM>Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism</EM> <STRONG>81</STRONG>: 1347-1352.
<P>
 Genes on the long arm of Y (Yq), particularly within
          interval 6, are believed to play a critical role in human
          spermatogenesis. Cytogenetically detectable deletions of
          this region are associated with azoospermia in men, but are
          relatively uncommon. It has been hypothesized that
          microdeletions of Yq may account for a significant
          proportion of men with infertility. The objective of this
          study was to validate a sequence-tagged site (STS)-mapping
          strategy for the detection of Yq microdeletions and to use
          this method to determine the proportion of men with
          idiopathic azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia who carry
          microdeletions in Yq. STS mapping of a sufficiently large
          sample of infertile men should also help further localize
          the putative gene(s) involved in the pathogenesis of male
          infertility.
<P>
          Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes of 16
          normal fertile men, 7 normal fertile women, 60 infertile
          men (50 of whom had azoospermia and 10 of whom had severe
          oligozoospermia with no other recognizable cause of
          infertility), and 15 patients with the X-linked disorder,
          ichthyosis. PCR primers were synthesized for 26 STSs that
          span Yq interval 6.
<P>
          None of the 16 normal men of known fertility had
          microdeletions.
<P>
          Seven normal fertile women failed to amplify any of the 26
          STSs, providing evidence of their Y specificity. No
          microdeletions were detected in any of the 15 patients with
          ichthyosis. Of the 60 infertile men typed with 26 STSs, 11
          (18%; 10 azoospermic and 1 oligozoospermic) failed to
          amplify 1 or more STS. Interestingly, 4 of the 11 patients
          had microdeletions in a region that is outside the Yq
          region from which the DAZ (deleted in azoospermia gene
          region) gene was cloned. In an additional 3 patients,
          microdeletions were present both inside and outside the DAZ
          region. In 3 subjects, the microdeletions were verified by
          Southern analysis using labeled PCR products corresponding
          to the deleted STSs as probes.
<P>
          These data suggest a high prevalence (18%) of Yq
          microdeletions in men with idiopathic azoospermia/severe
          oligospermia. The physical locations of these
          microdeletions provide further support for the concept that
          a gene(s) on Yq deletion interval 6 plays an important role
          in spermatogenesis. The presence of deletions that do not
          overlap with the DAZ region suggests that genes other than
          the DAZ gene may also be implicated in the pathogenesis of
          some subsets of male infertility.

<P>Prince Henrys Institute of Medical Research began in 1960 as a result of initiatives 
of certain staff and Board members of Prince Henrys Hospital.  It functioned semi-autonomously 
as a department of Prince Henrys Hospital, and then of the amalgamated Monash Medical 
Centre, until its incorporation in 1990 under its own Act of Parliament of Victoria 
as an independent research institute.
<P>Physically the Institute is located at <A HREF="gifs/map2.gif">Block E</A> of the <A HREF="gifs/map1.gif">Monash Medical Centre</A> where 
the administration, general laboratories, clinical services as well as small animal 
laboratories are housed.  In addition there is a large-animal facility at Werribee. 
The staff comprises about 100 scientists, physicians, students and support personnel.
<P>Since its inception, the Institute has attracted students and fellows from disciplines 
such as general endocrinology, reproductive biology, obstetrics and gynaecology, 
biochemistry, pharmacology, physiology, anatomy and molecular biology.  The Institute 
provides a unique opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to obtain 
training in medical research.
<P>Through its association with <A HREF="http://www.mmcc.monash.edu.au/">Monash Medical Centre</A>, the Institute has access to comprehensive library information systems and other facilities.
<P>There are extensive facilities at the Institute for molecular biology, tissue 
culture, electrophysiology, histology, radioimmunoassay, protein purification and 
the study of neuro-transmitter release and receptors.  Many of these facilities are 
in communal laboratories designed to promote the exchange of technical information 
between disciplines.
<P>At the Institute there is the combination of <A HREF="stubk95.htm">basic research </A>activities with <A HREF="clin-rep.htm">clinical 
practice</A>.  Thus we are in an excellent position to offer a comprehensive training 
environment from the molecular aspects of basic research through to patient care.<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Times Roman"><I>O</I></FONT>ur Institute's main purpose is to undertake research, both <A HREF="stubk95.htm">basic</A> and 
<A HREF="clin-rep.htm">clinically</A> directed, in the specialised area of endocrinology.  The name - endocrinology 
-  is really an old term to cover the study of chemical messengers which are produced 
and released from one body organ to influence the behaviour of other body organs 
as well as its own.
<P>	Another way to describe our research is that we are studying the way the body 
communicates within itself.  We deal with hormones, transmitters, growth factors 
and other such substances which are able to control our body functions.  Our 
broad areas of interest include endocrinology of the <A HREF="stubk95.htm#Neuroendocrinology">brain</A>, the <A HREF="stubk95.htm#Pharmacology">cardiovascular system</A>, 
<A HREF="stubk95.htm#Peter Fuller">salt balance</A> and both <A HREF="stubk95.htm#Male">male</A> and <A HREF="stubk95.htm#Uterine Biology">female</A> reproduction.  Within these areas we specialise 
in such topics as the ovulation process, menstrual bleeding, male infertility 
and cardiovascular disease, where chemical transmitters are involved. 
<P>	We pride ourselves however that we are able to take basic information gained 
in the laboratory and ultimately use it for improving the health of our society. 
 There are many such examples of combining both basic and clinical research 
within the Institute.  Dr <A HREF="stubk95.htm#Uterine Biology">Lois Salamonsen</A>, for example, is studying menstruation 
which entails understanding the process at a cellular level as well as in the whole 
body with a view to alleviating a very common problem in women's health.  
Dr <A HREF="stubk95.htm#Peter Fuller">Peter Fuller</A> is interested in how hormones affect our salt balance and these studies 
entail examining the genes of the hormones involved as well as studying specific 
families in our community who have salt balance problems.  Overall we are 
an Institution of over 100 research staff, students and technical and administrative 
staff.  We are incorporated under an Act of Parliament and thus are an independant 
organisation with its own board, responsible to the State Parliament.  
<P>
<P>We are funded by a combination of grants received competitively from various 
government and non-government agencies, both within Australia and world wide, from our own resources and importantly from 
<A HREF="howuhelp.htm">donations</A> from the community.

<P>My major interests are in the clinical physiology and pathophysiology of inhibin 
and inhibin-related peptides.  Current studies are directed towards establishing 
the diagnostic role of inhibin assay in ovarian cancer, the role of inhibin in the 
menopausal transition and the control mechanisms for inhibin in the human menstrual 
cycle.  New assays for inhibin and inhibin-related peptides are under development 
to allow characterisation of the role of inhibin in the pituitary-testicular and 
pituitary-ovarian axes.  I am also involved in studies of the management of menopause.<BR>

<B>Cell biology of synthesis and secretion of pituitary hormones</B>
<P> 
This laboratory is interested in the regulation of synthesis and secretion of 
hormones in pituitary cells, mainly growth hormone (GH).  This study has important 
impacts for both basic and clinical sciences.  GH is a representative hormone from 
anterior pituitary gland regulated by hypothalamic stimulator and inhibitor.  GH 
and its secretagogues are currently used therapeutically as anabolic reagents in 
GH deficiency patients and patients with wasting disorders.  We currently use primary 
cultured GH cells from human (acromegaly), sheep, rat pituitary glands and GH cell 
lines as our experimental model. 
<P><b>Electrophysiology studies</b>
<P>We aim to elucidate the role of ion channels in GH secretion and the modification 
of ion channels by GH secretagogues.  Sophisticated patch-clamp techniques are used 
in this study and the roles of particular G-proteins or signalling molecules in the 
response are addressed using intracellular antibodies and antisense oligonucleotides 
dialysis techniques.  Single cell [Ca2+]i and secretion (membrane capacitance measurement) 
will also be measured in combination with ion channel recording to clarify the whole 
process of single cell regulatory mechanism.
<P><b>Second messenger studies</b>
<br>The focus of the study into this area will be the cross-talk between different 
signalling systems in pituitary cells.  The regulation of signalling systems by GH 
secretagogues will be investigated by direct measurements of three major signalling 
pathways, PKC, cAMP-PKA, and InsP3-[Ca2+]i.  Different pharmacological reagents to 
affect these signalling pathways will be used with a particular attention to the 
cross-talk of different systems.  These data will also be combined with hormone synthesis 
and secretion.
<P><b>Molecular biology studies</b>
<br>This will be focused on the effect of GH secretagogues on the synthesis of receptors 
for different GH secretagogues and GH in pituitary cells.  These will be performed 
employing northern blotting and in situ hybridization techniques with specific mRNA 
probes for GH-releasing hormone and peptide receptors and GH.  These experiments 
will also be performed with pharmacological manipulation of signalling systems (inhibitors, 
stimulators and down-regulation).<BR>

<BR><B>Hormonal effects on brain and pituitary gland function</B>
<BR> 
<P>This laboratory is interested in the brain systems that control the pituitary gland.  We use the sheep as an 
experimental model.  The techniques involved include the following:-

<P>	- collection of hypophysial portal blood for the measurement of factors released from the brain.

<BR>	- surgical isolation of the pituitary gland from the brain to study the direct pituitary actions of 		
	hormones in vivo.

<BR>	- implantation of guide tubes into discrete nuclei in the brain to study the direct application of 		
	neurotransmitters, antagonists etc. on particular cells that control the pituitary gland.

<BR>	- immunocytochemistry and hybridization histochemistry of cells in the brain to quantify 		
	changes that are affected by hormones or physiological manipulation, e.g. stress, nutrition.

<BR>	- measurement, by Northern blot analysis, of the levels of mRNA in cells of the pituitary gland 		
	in response to specific hormonal and physiological factors.

<BR>	- measurement of second messenger levels in defined types of pituitary cells in response to 		
	hormonal factors.

<P>These studies are aimed at the development of a deeper understanding of the way in which the brain 
controls the endocrine system via the pituitary gland.  We also seek to understand the way that hormones 
from glands such as the ovaries, testes and adrenals etc. affect brain and pituitary gland function.<BR>

<BR><B>Inhibin, activin and follistatin in the pituitary and kidney: where, how and 
why do they act?</B>  
<BR> 
<P>Our studies focus on the various ways that the recently discovered proteins - 
inhibin, activin, and the activin-binding protein follistatin - which are produced 
in the testis and ovary, regulate the gonadotrophins, follicle-stimulating hormone 
(FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), in primary cultures of rat anterior pituitary 
cells.  We investigate the effects of these proteins on gonadotrophic function in 
the absence and presence of other physiological substances and various drugs using 
a range of biochemical assays.  Additional studies concern the production of these 
proteins by different cells within the pituitary itself, and of follistatin production 
by mesangial cells in the kidney.  
<P>Our overall goal is to determine the physiological roles of these proteins in 
the pituitary and kidney, especially with regard to the control of fertility, and 
to understand the subcellular mechanisms by which they act.<BR>

<BR><B>Local Regulation in the Ovary</B> 
<BR> 
<P>We are interested in local paracrine factors which regulate development of the 
follicles and corpora lutea in the ovary.  Specifically, we are examining the role 
of two inhibin-related peptides, activin and follistatin, in folliculogenesis, atresia 
and luteinization.  Our hypothesis is that activin enhances gonadotrophin-induced 
folliculogenesis and prevents premature luteinization or atresia, whereas follistatin 
has the opposite effects, promoting luteinization and atresia.  The studies involve 
<I>in vitro</I> cultures of rat and bovine ovarian cells and analysis of expression 
of mRNA coding for hormones and receptors, radioimmunoassays of hormones and cAMP, and analysis 
of enzyme activities and hormone receptors.<BR>

<BR><B>Molecular endocrinology and molecular oncology</B>

<P>The group has three main areas of interest: steroid hormone action, intestinal 
growth and ovarian cancer.  These areas are addressed using a range of techniques 
in molecular biology including: DNA sequencing, PCR, gene expression, cell culture, 
cloning, differential display and hybridization histochemistry.
<P>The work in our laboratory is focused particularly around steroid hormones, their 
receptors and how they regulate gene expression.  Projects currently under way in 
this area are directed at: identifying the genes regulated by aldosterone, the principal 
steroid hormone regulating salt balance; characterising the mutations responsible 
for resistance (loss of binding to the receptor) to aldosterone in certain patients 
and cortisol in guinea pigs; and understanding the way steroid hormone receptors 
control gene transcription.  We are also collaborating with a group at the Royal 
Children's Hospital to explore the changes in gene expression which occur in regenerating 
small bowel.  This involves studies using rats and pigs.
<P>The third area of interest involves a collaboration with Professor Burger to identify 
the molecular basis of the inhibin secretion seen in some ovarian tumors.  The focus 
is on possible mutations in hormones, receptor and signalling genes.<br>

<B>Neuropharmacology</B>  

<P>Investigations are being conducted into the molecular mechanisms through which 
drugs and hormones alter nerve action and, specifically, neuro-transmitter release. 
 
<P>This involves studies in the central nervous system (where there may be relevance 
to diseases such as depression, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease), as 
well as the autonomic nervous system (where there may be implications in the control 
of heart function and blood pressure).  Current emphasis is on second messenger systems, 
protein kinases, Ca2+ and signalling at nerve terminals and how drugs can modulate 
these to effect changes in neuro-transmission. This work involves studies in neurones 
grown in culture, synaptosomes as well as neurotransmitter release studies in brain 
slices, heart and blood vessels.

<P><B>Cardiovascular Pharmacology</B>  

<P>We are currently studying the role of hormones released during stress on the development 
of high blood pressure in experimental animals.  The focus of this work is on the 
roles of adrenaline, opioid peptides and angiotensin II on autonomic neurotransmission 
and blood pressure and myocardial dysfunction.  Another project is concerned with 
the mechanisms through which drugs can affect the force and rate of beating of the 
heart, particularly by altering intracellular calcium levels  This may have relevance 
for future development of drugs to protect the heart after a heart attack.<BR>

<P>My principle interest is how nerve activity is controlled at the biochemical level. 
 I am currently studying the role of non-selective cation channels in modulating 
nerve activity and my particular interest is the role they may play in the action 
of the novel, recently discovered Imidazoline receptors.  My experiments involve radioligand binding, paticularly imidazoline receptors and nicotinic receptors in nerve membranes. This is done in conjunction with studies of the  modulation of nicotinic neurotarnsmission in defined brain regions.  Also, modulation of intracellular calcium in neurons is also investigated.  These studies may ultimately improve therapeutic approaches to high blood pressure and stroke.<BR>

<BR><B>Molecular biology of inhibin and activin</B>
<BR> 
<P>My main interest is how proteins work.  I am studying the reproductive hormones 
inhibin and activin.  Questions about protein structure can be addressed by the use 
of molecular biology to construct point mutations in the proteins.  Expression of 
mutant proteins in mammalian cells can be used to answer questions about their biosynthesis, 
receptor binding sites and their 3 dimensional structure (i.e. about how these proteins 
are folded and processed intracellularly).  These studies involve the use of state-of-the-art 
molecular and cell biology techniques. A background in biochemistry is desirable.<BR>

<BR><B>The hormonal control of spermatogenesis</B>
<P>Testosterone and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) are essential for spermatogenesis 
yet their mechanism of action, and the process of spermatogenesis itself, are poorly 
understood.  Sertoli cells support and nurture developing germ cells and presumably 
mediate testosterone and FSH action.  Using adult male rats, we have developed an 
<I>in vivo</I> model system enabling the withdrawal and restoration of testosterone 
and FSH action on the testis.  We aim to study the maturation of spermatids, a testosterone-specific 
process using isolated seminiferous tubules, and cultured germ and Sertoli cells. 
 Specifically, we hypothesise that testosterone maintains the attachment of spermatids 
to Sertoli cells and aim to identify specific testosterone-induced protein/genes 
which mediate this action.  We are also studying the control and expression of testosterone 
receptors and local growth factors within the spermatogenic epithelium.  These studies 
involve radioimmunoassays and ligand binding assays, RNA purification/Northern blot 
analysis, cell culture, protein purification/electrophoresis, and histological studies. 
 The results will be useful in understanding the normal process of spermatogenesis. 
 Extension of these studies into the human male is a priority with a view to assessing, 
and making more effective, strategies for male contraception as well as for gaining 
a better understanding of male infertility.<BR>

<BR><B></B><B>Characterisation of protein hormones involved in reproduction</B>  
<BR> 
<P>One aspect in the regulation of fertility in both sexes involves the interplay 
of hormones between the pituitary and the gonads.  The pituitary hormones are primarily 
follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone while the gonadal hormones are 
inhibin and related proteins.  Studies with Dr. Peter Stanton in this laboratory 
involve the characterisation of the types of pituitary hormones secreted as it appears 
that these proteins exist in classes with differing biological activities and the 
production of these hormone classes is subject to regulation.  The second area involves 
characterising inhibin and related proteins which regulate the pituitary secretion 
of follicle-stimulating hormone, a key hormone.  A number of related proteins have 
been identified with different, even opposing, activities.  However, how these proteins 
act to control follicle-stimulating hormone secretion is not clear.  Studies are 
currently centred on identifying these proteins, including in serum, developing assay

<P>1.	Embryo-Maternal Interactions in Early Pregnancy
<BR>2.	Regulation of Menstruation and abnormal uterine bleeding
<BR>We are interested in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying 
the processes of menstruation and embryo implantation.  Current projects in both 
the sheep and the human include:<BR>
a) examination of some of the enzymes (the matrix metallo-proteinases) that affect 
the remodelling of endometrial tissue.  We have recently shown that these have important 
roles in the degradation of tissue that accompanies both menstruation and embryo 
implantation and continue to examine the mechanisms involved in regulation of their 
expression and in their activation.<BR>
b) evaluation of the role of the biologically important peptides, endothelin and 
leukemia inhibitory factor, both of which are expressed by the endometrium and which 
appear to have roles in embryo implantation and in regulation of endometrial bleeding.<BR>
c)  evaluation of the roles of endothelin and of matrix metallo-proteinases in 
dysfunctional endometrial bleeding.<BR>

<BR><B>Steroid Feedback on Gonadotrophin Releasing Hormone Secretion</B>

<P>I am an NH&amp;MRC Australian Postdoctoral Fellow working with <A HREF="#Neuroendocrinology">Assoc Prof  Iain 
Clarke</A>, and <a href="http://www.monash.edu.au/informatics/physiol/phonelst.htm">Dr Alan Tilbrook </a>(Dept. Physiology, Monash University).  My research 
concerns the brain control of reproduction, chiefly the control of gonadotrophin 
releasing hormone (GnRH)  secretion.  I particular I am interested in the mechanisms 
of feedback of gonadal steroids on GnRH secretion.  Using sheep as a model, my work 
investigates the mechanism(s) by which oestrogen triggers the massive release (surge) 
of luteinizing hormone (LH)  that triggers ovulation.  In addition, using male sheep 
I am also interested in the mechanisms by which testosterone regulates GnRH and LH 
secretion.  GnRH neurons do not contain oestrogen or androgen receptors.  Thus the 
feedback effects of gonadal steroids must be mediated via other neural systems.  
My aim is to identify these intermediary systems and elucidate the mechanisms by 
which they operate.   A variety of in vitro and in vivo techniques are used to investigate 
these systems.  These include immunocytochemistry, in situ hybridization, retrograde 
and anterograde neural tracing and microinjection and microimplantation of neurochemicals 
or steroids into discrete brain loci.  <BR>

<BR><B>Cell-cell interactions during spermatogenesis</B>
<BR> 
<P>The process of spermatogenesis in the rat has been shown in this laboratory to 
be particularly dependent on serum testosterone concentrations, with a failure in 
sperm production at Stage VIII of the spermatogenesis cycle if testosterone is removed. 
 We have hypothesised that this failure is due to the loss of testosterone-dependent 
cell-adhesion molecules on the cell surfaces of the maturing spermatids and their 
associated Sertoli cells, which causes the cells to slough off.  We aim to test this 
hypothesis by purifying and characterising the types of cell adhesion molecules present 
on spermatids and Sertoli cells, using purification techniques including 2D electrophoresis 
and HPLC.  The specific cellular location of the cell adhesion molecules will then 
be determined by an immuno-cytochemical approach, and the dependence of protein expression 
on testosterone concentrations determined by RNA purification/Northern blot analysis.
<P><B>Role of heterogeneity in gonadotropin structure and function</B>
<BR>The gonadotropins, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinising hormone (FSH &amp; 
LH) are protein hormones important in fertility which are secreted by the pituitary 
gland as a heterogeneous population of many forms, or isoforms, of each hormone. 
 However, at this stage the reasons for this heterogeneity, and the ways in which 
hormonal bioactivity are affected remain unclear.  
<BR>Using a series of highly purified isoforms of human LH and hFSH which we have 
prepared, we are currently investigating both their molecular structures and in vitro 
and in vivo bioactivities.  The results will be useful in correlating biological 
function with particular protein structure changes, and for investigating the reasons 
why isoforms are produced.<BR>

<P>The Institute has had a long involvement in the research and treatment of infertility. 
 
<P>Our Reproductive Medicine Clinic was established in 1976 and provides a clinical 
service for infertile couples.  It is assisted by the ovulation induction and  donor 
insemination services and the Andrology Laboratory.  

<P>In addition to the services a number of clinical programmes and research projects have been initiated.

<P><B>A Weight Loss and Fitness Program for Overweight Infertile Women</B><B><I>

weight loss and increased fitness.  Weekly sessions of 1&frac12; hours of exercise 
were undertaken followed by an hour with a variety of experts from the fields of 
dietetics/nutrition, physiotherapy, psychology and medicine.
<P>In collaboration with colleagues from the Queensland Institute of Medical Research 
we have commenced a follow-up study of women treated for infertility prior to 1985, 
at the Prince Henry's Hospital Medical Research Centre site in South Melbourne.  
The follow up seeks to obtain information about various aspects of the health of 
women so treated, in the light of recent questions as to whether infertility treatments 
might have long term consequences. <BR>

<P><IMG SRC="gifs/blueball.gif"><B><I>Menopause</I></B>
<P>A number of clinical research projects have been undertaken to optimise hormone 
therapy for post-menopausal women.  Results are currently being collated and analysed. 
 In addition a study has been undertaken of blood levels of oestrogen achieved following 
the administration of oestradiol implants.  Eighteen women have been studied to date 
and the Institute is still seeking volunteers who have undergone hysterectomy, are 
in good health and are willing to have hormone therapy using implants.<BR>

<A NAME="Bone"></A>
<P><IMG SRC="gifs/blueball.gif"><B><I>Bone Density Service</I></B>
<P>A service undertaken by the Institute is the assessment of bone density in women 
after menopause when bone thinning, leading to bone fracture, becomes prevalent. 
 Bone loss after the menopause results from the marked decline in oestrogen levels. 
 
<P>The ovary produces oestrogen during the reproductive years but around the time 
of the menopause there is a 90% fall in oestrogen production which in turn results 
in bone loss.  
<P>To identify women at high risk for excessive bone loss and hence at increased 
risk of fracture, forearm bone density is measured and compared to that of normal 
young healthy women.  Those who have low values are advised to modify their diet 
and undertake regular exercise as well as consider the possibility of hormone therapy 
to restrict bone loss.  Joan Crane, a medical technologist, is responsible for this service and an appointment can 
be made (without a referral) to see her by contacting the Institute.

<H1><center><FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR="#FF0000" FACE="Times Roman"><B>How You Can Help</B></FONT></center></H1>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Times Roman"><I>P</I></FONT>rince Henrys Institute of Medical Research has, for over 30 
years, attracted significant research grants from organizations within Australia 
and overseas.  We do, however, depend heavily on the support we receive from the 
community, and the devotion and generosity of our many benefactors, both corporate 
and personal.  This public spirited community support is a great encouragement and 
gives us the flexibility to pursue new research initiatives as soon as opportunities 
arise.
<P>
<P>Donations are used exclusively for research programs.  For this reason, it is 
not necessary for a donor to specify a particular purpose.  
<P>If, however, a donor requests that the donation be directed towards a specific 
research program, then we will, of course, do so.  Donations are allowable income 
tax deductions. 
<P>Our supporters provide financial help in a number of ways including donations, 
grants, gifts (shares, property, other assets), legacies and bequests.  Our <A HREF="mailto:Tony.Reynolds@med.monash.edu.au">Business 
Manager </A>will be pleased to discuss any of these with you.  The most popular ways 
to support us are:
<P><FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Times Roman"><B><I>Bequests</I></B></FONT>
<P>In addition to their regular gifts, many of our benefactors are setting aside 
a contribution for our important research work through their Will.  They see this 
as one way to extend their help beyond their own life-time.  When considering including 
the Institute in your Will, it may be advisable to seek professional advice from 
your solicitor, accountant or other consultant with respect to taxation, probate 
or other financial matters.  Our Business Manager will be pleased to discuss any 
aspect with you.  A conventional bequest could be worded as follows:
<P>"I give to Prince Henry's Institute of Medical Research .....(here 
insert the sum of money, percentage of estate or description of property)..... free 
of State and Federal duties and declare that the receipt of the Director, or other 
proper officer of the Institute shall be a full discharge to my Executors 
for this bequest."
<P><FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Times Roman"><B><I>Named Fund</I></B></FONT>
<P>Another option which may be of interest is a named fund and this can be done by 
a single gift or by instalments.  Once again, we invite you to discuss this with 
our Business Manager if this way of helping the Institute appeals.
<P><FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Times Roman"><B><I>Memorial Gifts</I></B></FONT>
<P>A number of our donors send gifts in memory of friends or loved ones - a most 
thoughtful gesture
<P><FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Times Roman"><B><I>Donations</I></B></FONT>
<P>Many interested people and concerned companies have contributed generously over 
the years - a large number of them do so each year.  This support is vital for our 
ongoing success, both nationally and internationally.
<P>The sophisticated equipment necessary for research has a relatively short life 
and our ability to continue to contribute to the advancement of medical knowledge 
is heavily dependent on access to state-of-the-art equipment.

<P><FONT SIZE=+3 COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Times Roman">F</FONT>or many years our scientists have shared the facilities of the Victorian Dept 
of Agriculture at Werribee for their various research projects using the sheep as 
a model.  However, our section of these facilities was withdrawn at fairly short 
notice to allow the State Chemistry Laboratory to transfer to Werribee.  We had two 
choices - leave the site and the experimental models developed over many years or 
build.  We decided to build!
<P>A total cost of $900,000 for construction and equipment seemed an overwhelming 
proposition.  However, a grant of $450,000 from the State Minister for Health gave 
us the confidence to sign contracts and start building.  Generous donations from 
the Ian Potter Foundation, National Australia Bank, the Felton Bequest, Perpetual 
Trustees and JB Were &amp; Son have helped to bridge the gap.  
<P>All of this support means that we have raised over $600,000 but the challenge 
remains to raise the balance of $300,000 by the end of 1996.
<P>The Institute's Biological Resources Facility with its own office, labs and sheep 
holding facilities is now complete and was formaly opened on September 20th.

<center><FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR="#FF0000" FACE="Times Roman"><B>Understanding how the male pill will work</B></FONT></center>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3 COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="Times Roman">T</FONT>here is a need to develop an effective and reversible male contraceptive other 
than the condom.  The male sex hormone testosterone can be given to normal men to 
reduce their sperm counts and promises to be a useful contraceptive.  The <A HREF="http://www.who.ch/">World Health Organisation</A> has recently completed two multi-national studies in which couples used 
testosterone injections for the male, as their only form of contraception.  In about 
70% of the men sperm counts reduced to zero, however in the remaining men, sperm 
counts were not fully suppressed and there was some possibility of continued fertility. 
 There is currently no explanation for this difference in response.  Furthermore, 
the weekly injections of testosterone were found by many of the men to be unacceptable 
for long-term use.  There is obviously a need to improve both the efficacy and acceptability 
of male contraceptive methods.<p>

<a href="gifs/newsl-fg.gif"><img alt="spermatids" src="gifs/nestmb.gif" height=50><BR>Click here for Full diagram</a>
<P>Drs <a href="stubk95.htm#Male">Rob McLachlan</a>,<a href="stubk95.htm#R"> David Robertson</a>, <a href="stubk95.htm#stanton">Peter Stanton</a> and PhD scholar Liza O'Donnell 
have been addressing the mechanisms by which testosterone acts to impair sperm counts 
using the rat model system.  We have found that sperm production continues in testosterone 
treated rats up to a particular point in the late phases of sperm development.  It 
is at this time that the round sperm cell begins to develop its characteristic elongated 
shape with a tail.  In response to testosterone treatment we find that this particular 
point is interrupted and immature sperm begin to slough away from the sperm producing 
tubules and are lost resulting in infertility.  It remains to be established whether 
it is at this point that the variable response of humans to testosterone administration 
occurs.  Furthermore, in the rat we have found evidence that the potent metabolite 
of testosterone called 'dihydrotestosterone' (DHT) plays an important role in maintaining 
sperm production in the testosterone-treated rat model.  Again the question arises 
whether in humans low levels of DHT production persist in the testis and that this 
is the reason why sperm counts do not fall to zero.  Such an event would be amenable 
to treatments using the new potent 5<FONT FACE="Symbol">a</FONT>-reductase enzyme inhibitors, which are already 
in clinical use for  the treatment of prostatic hypertrophy.
<P>Our current studies are being extended into the non-human primate in collaboration 
with investigators in both Germany and United States.  We will use the primate model 
to gain further insight into the mechanism of testosterone-induced contraception. 
 In addition, we have commenced a clinical study in which men will receive testosterone 
for several months prior to undergoing a previously planned vasectomy.  This would 
give us the opportunity to look at the structure of the human testis following exposure 
to testosterone as used in the contraceptive trials.
<P>It is our aim to understand the mechanism of normal sperm production and how it 
can be best inhibited with reversible hormonal treatments.  Without this necessary 
understanding the goal of reversible male contraception in wide use in the population 
will remain elusive.

<center><H2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000" FACE="Times Roman">About the Institute</FONT></H2></center>
<P>Prince Henrys Institute of Medical Research began in 1960 as a result of initiatives 
of certain staff and Board members of Prince Henrys Hospital.  It functioned semi-autonomously 
as a department of Prince Henrys Hospital, and then of the amalgamated Monash Medical 
Centre, until its incorporation in 1990 under its own Act of Parliament of Victoria 
as an independent research institute.
<P>Physically the Institute is located at <A HREF="gifs/map2.gif">Block E</A> of the <A HREF="gifs/map1.gif">Monash Medical Centre</A> where 
the administration, general laboratories, clinical services as well as small animal 
laboratories are housed.  In addition there is a large-animal facility at Werribee. 
The staff comprises about 100 scientists, physicians, students and support personnel.
<P>Since its inception, the Institute has attracted students and fellows from disciplines 
such as general endocrinology, reproductive biology, obstetrics and gynaecology, 
biochemistry, pharmacology, physiology, anatomy and molecular biology.  The Institute 
provides a unique opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to obtain 
training in medical research.
<P>Through its association with <A HREF="http://www.mmcc.monash.edu.au/">Monash Medical Centre</A>, the Institute has access to comprehensive library information systems and other facilities.
<P>There are extensive facilities at the Institute for molecular biology, tissue 
culture, electrophysiology, histology, radioimmunoassay, protein purification and 
the study of neuro-transmitter release and receptors.  Many of these facilities are 
in communal laboratories designed to promote the exchange of technical information 
between disciplines.
<P>At the Institute there is the combination of <A HREF="stubk95.htm">basic research </A>activities with <A HREF="clin-rep.htm">clinical 
practice</A>.  Thus we are in an excellent position to offer a comprehensive training 
environment from the molecular aspects of basic research through to patient care.<BR>

Welcome to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynacology at Monash University.
The Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology is located on level 5
at Monash Medical Centre.  It is part of the larger Institute of
Reproduction and Development, and has collaborative links with a
number of other organisations including Prince Henry's Institute of
Medical Research.

The Department has a strong track record in basic research and
excellent research facilities.  Research interests within the
Department are quite varied and range from clinical through to
basic. 

<H1>PHD Opportunities in the department</H1>
Three new projects are being offered for commencement in 1997:

<H3>PROJECT: Angiogenesis in the female reproductive tract.</H3>

Angiogenesis
or new blood vessel growth is uncommon in adults except during wound
healing or the growth of solid tumours.  An exception to this is the
female reproductive tract where new blood vessel growth occurs each
cycle in the endometrium and ovary.  This project will fit in with
the ongoing work in an active laboratory researching the mechanisms
that control vascular growth and regression in human and rat
endometrium and ovary.  A wide range of techniques are available
including molecular biology, in situ hybridisation,
immunocytochemistry, image analysis, in vivo microscopy and tissue
culture.
<P>
<H3>SUPERVISOR: Dr. Peter Rogers</H3>
Dr. Peter Rogers is an NH&MRC Principal Research Fellow
with a research group of 15 staff and students.  His research
interests include endometrial physiology, angiogenesis, embryo
implantation, and a range of clinical issues such as endometriosis,
menorrhagia and ovarian cancer.

<H3>PROJECT: To use molecular techniques to study the biology of uterine
fibroids. </H3>
One in four women over the age of 40 have benign growths
of the uterine myometrium, or fibroids.  Fibroids can cause
excessive menstrual blood loss (menorrhagia), pain, infertility and
problems during pregnancy.  They are the commonest single reason for
hysterectomy.  This project will utilize differential display and
representational difference analysis to identify genes expressed by
fibroids that are not expressed in normal myometrium.  This
information will be used to pursue a number of basic and clinical
issues relating to the biology of fibroids.

<H3>SUPERVISOR: Dr. Beverly Vollenhoven</H3>
Dr. Beverly Vollenhoven is an Obstetrician and
Gynaecologist who completed a PhD on the molecular biology of
fibroids in 1993.  She has international recognition for her work on
fibroids.  Clinical interests include reproductive endocrinology and
IVF.

<H3>To study the regulation of inhibin and activin secretion
from the human placenta and fetal membranes at different gestations
in normal pregnancies and in chromosomally abnormal pregnancy.</H3>
The resulting data would be expected to assist in the development of
novel methods of prenatal diagnosis and in the understanding of the
possible mechanisms controlling parturition.

<H3>SUPERVISOR: Dr. Wallace</H3> 
Dr. Wallace is a clinical scientist, previously from
Edinburgh, Scotland where he worked in the University of Edinburgh
Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in the Centre for
Reproductive Biology.  He has an established track-record in the
study of inhibins in male infertility and in pregnancy having
published in these areas.  His clinical interests are in prenatal
detection of aneuploidy (eg. Down's syndrome) and in high risk
obstetrics including preterm labour.

<H1>The Late Effects of Childhood Cancer</H1>
<hr><H2>Establishment of a Late Effects Clinic at Monash Medical Centre</H2>
A clinic has been established at Monash Medical Centre  to follow-up adolescent and adult survivors of childhood malignancy treated at this institution and at the former Queen Victoria Medical Centre. <P>
Broadly, our clinic serves to carry out the following aims:<P>
<OL><LI>Detection and treatment of late toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy.<BR>
<LI>Monitoring for disease relapse.<BR>
<LI>Surveillance for secondary tumours.<BR>
<LI>Facilitation of research into late effects of therapy with a view to altering future treatment regimes to improve treatment-induced morbidity.
</OL>
The clinic is staffed by paediatricians from the oncology and endocrinology units.<BR>
The co-ordinator is <A HREF="hauser.html">Dr. Simon Hauser.</A><p>
<A NAME="late_effects"></A>Recent advances in treatment of both haematological and solid malignancies have had a significant impact on survival from childhood cancer. Survival after acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the commonest childhood cancer, has increased from a 9% 5 year event-free survival (EFS) in the early 1960's to a 71% EFS in the mid-1980's. Progression from single drug to multi-drug chemotherapy, rationalisation of radiotherapy administration, improvements in surgical techniques, better application of supportive care and the advent of more intensive treatment including bone marrow "rescue" transplantation have all contributed to this reduced mortality. Also it is now possible for patients with relapsed disease to enter long-term remission. These patients are especially at risk of drug and radiation induced toxicity. However the increased survival comes at a cost - studies documenting the morbidity of long-term survivors have found a myriad of side-effects directly attributable to their previous cancer therapy. In children, the effects of treatment on growth, development and reproductive capacity assume a major task of monitoring.<P>
This increased survival also places the child at risk for development of second tumours, which may be related to treatment, the underlying tumour or to a particular genetic susceptibility.<P>
Long-term follow-up of  survivors of childhood cancer thus enables problems related to the particular type of therapy to be addressed and it allows for surveillance for second tumours. Further, understanding the late effects of treatment allows treatment for the next generation of cancer patients to be tailored in such a way as to provide the most effective therapy at the least cost.<P>
It has been estimated that in the U.K. 1 in 600 children will develop cancer. Approximately 60% of these children will be expected to survive to adulthood. In 1988  in the United States there are estimated to be 36,000 children who are long-term survivors of cancer. Figures again from the United States indicate that there are approximately 1500 patients annually who become long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.<P>
Studies have documented which patients are at highest risk for late effects of treatment. Age at treatment is the most important variable. The younger the child, the greater the risk of developing long-term sequelae. Those who received radiotherapy need to be followed closely - the risk increases with higher total doses and younger age. The cumulative effect of radiotherapy and chemotherapy need to be remembered with particular reference to the lungs and heart. All patients who received alkylating agents of a reasonable dose need to be assessed for infertility. Patients who received anthracycline therapy need close follow-up of their cardiac status.<P>
Follow-up needs to be individualised and time after the assessment should be set aside to discuss in detail the treatment received and the long-term monitoring that is required. Ample opportunity should also be given for the patient to express any psychosocial difficulties experienced as a direct result of the therapy and hospitalisation. <P>

<title>Intra-osseous Infusions</title>
<body vlink="#B90003" background=spiral_page.gif><blockquote>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Intra-osseous Infusions</H2><HR>
Intraosseous infusions are a safe and reliable means of delivering drugs and fluids in patients in whom intravenous access is unvailable.<p>
<BR>
<h3>Indications:</h3>
Shocked patients requiring immediate resuscitation in whom several attempts at IV access have failed.<p>
<BR>
<h3>Contraindications:</h3>
Severe trauma to lower limbs.<p>
<BR>
<h3>Technique:</h3>	Use either intra-osseous kit or spinal needle (16 or 18 guage).  The <B>tibia</B> is the preferred site - either proximal or distal.<p>
<ul><li><B>Proximal :</B>	1 - 2 cm inferior to the midpoint of a line drawn from the tibial tuberosity to the medial aspect of the tibia.<p>
<li><B>Distal :</B>	1 - 2 cm above the medial malleolus<p>
Insert the needle perpendicular to the bone with a screwing motion.  The needle will '"'give'"' when the marrow cavity is entered.  Needle rarely need to be inserted more than 1 cm.  Marrow can usually be aspirated following insertion, and may be used for electrolyte analysis.<p>
</ul><BR>
<h3>Use:</h3>
<B>Drugs :</B>	should be flushed with 10 ml Norml Saline.<p>
<B>IV fluids :</B>	Gravity flow is generally slow - approx 10 ml/min.  If using for volume resuscitation, generally need pressure assisted flow.<p>
<BR>
<h3>Complications:	</h3>
<B>Extravasation</B> (especially if bone is fractured, or has cortical holes from previous attempts at IO insertion).<p>
<B>Infection :</B> osteomyelitis, cellulitis (both limited if needle is removed following stabilisation of patient).<p>
<B>Damage to epiphyseal plate</B> (avoid by careful attention to landmarks and keeping needle perpendicular to bone).<p>
<B>Fat embolus</B> (never reported but is a theoretical complication).<p>

<HTML><head><title>Poisoning Protocol</title></head>
<BODY vlink="#B90003">
<H3><b>PAEDIATRIC EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT POISON PROTOCOL<hr>
</H3>
</b>
Poisoning (whether accidental or intentional ) is a common emergency department problem in children and adolescents. While many poisonings  are trivial and  can be observed in the emergency department without admission, death can still occur from some poisons in seemingly insignificant doses, particularly in infants. <BR>
<BR>
All poisonings can be treated along general principles outlined in this protocol. In addition the poison index on the computer next to the paediatric emergency desk has a large database covering the vast majority of poisonings you are likely to encounter.<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="poison.gif"><B>Flowchart showing the Poisoning Protocol</B></A> (21K GIF)
<P>
<BR>
<H4>IMPORTANT POINTS<BR>
</H4>
<OL><LI>Ensure adequate airway protection:
Many patients are more at risk of death from aspiration due to depressed conscious state than the primary effects of the poison itself. If the patient has a poor  gag reflex or Glasgow Coma Score less than 10 they should be intubated to protect their airway. This should be done using a rapid induction technique by experienced personel (eg. anaesthetic registrar/consultant).<BR>
<BR>
<LI>If possible obtain the actual container that contains the poison.<BR>
This is important even if you think you know what the poison is as drug names are often confused by lay people. eg. "Amoxil":"Maxalon".<BR>
<BR>
<LI>ACTIVATED CHARCOAL is the method of choice for removal of poisons from the gastrointestinal tract. Emesis &amp; gastric lavage not routinely used in the emergency department.<BR>
NOTE: Activated charcoal is INEFFECTIVE against poisoning with iron, lithium, cyanide, pesticides, acids and alkalis.<BR>
Consult poison index before giving charcoal.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Poisoning should always be considered in the differential of any 	patient with depressed conscious state of uncertain cause.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Adolescents and older children will often take drugs/poisons as suicide attempts or for experimentation. It is common for these poisonings to be multiple eg. Tricyclics, benzodiazapines &amp; alcohol.<BR>
</OL>
<B>Note:</B> all  suicide attempts should be admitted for assessment however trivial the actual poisoning might be.<p>

<title>RAISED INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE</title>

<H1>RAISED INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE<hr></H1>
The intracranial space is a non-compliant cavity of fixed volume.  Contents include<BR>
brain, blood, CSF, supporting interstitium, and neuronal tissue.  The space is<BR>
separated into compartments by rigid dural layers.  The compliance of both the total<BR>
space and the subcompartments is limited, thus pressures can increase rapidly as a<BR>
result of small changes in volumes of contents, and herniation between compartments<BR>
or through the foramen magnum may result.  Similarly, dramatic decreases in<BR>
pressure can be obtained with small decreases in contents, which is the principal<BR>
underlying medical management of raised ICP.<BR>
<BR>
Increased intracranial pressure is a medical/surgical emergency.  It is the common<BR>
endpoint of a wide variety of disorders.  Symptoms and signs are non-specific.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Aetiology:</H3>
<!-- List Tag -->
<UL>
<LI>Meningitis, encephalitis, intracranial abscess<BR>
<LI>Subarachnoid haemorrhage<BR>
<LI>Subdural / extradural haemorrhage<BR>
<LI>Head trauma - blunt or penetrating<BR>
<LI>Hydrocephalus and shunt blockage in treated hydrocephalus<BR>
<LI>CNS tumours<BR>
<LI>Post-anoxic insult<BR>
<LI>Reye's syndrome<BR>
<LI>Benign intracranial hypertension
</UL>
<H3>Symptoms:</H3>
<!-- List Tag -->
<UL>
<LI>Headache - usually frontal and classically worse after lying down<BR>
<LI>Vomiting - classically early morning, and without associated nausea<BR>
<LI>Blurred vision
</UL>
<H3>Signs:</H3>
<!-- List Tag -->
<UL>
<LI>Tense fontanelle in infants<BR>
<LI>Depressed conscious state<BR>
<LI>Cushing's triad: hypertension, bradycardia, apnoea<BR>
<LI>Pupillary changes:  uni or bilateral pupillary dilation<BR>
<LI>VI nerve palsy (false localising sign)<BR>
<LI>Papilloedema - may not be present if increase in ICP is of recent onset (&lt; 24 hours)
</UL>
With the exception of VI nerve palsy, focal neurological signs generally relate to<BR>
underlying pathology rather than the raised ICP <CITE>per se</CITE>.<BR>

<H3>Management:</H3>
<B>RAISED ICP IS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY.  THE PAEDIATRIC INTENSIVIST<BR>
ON CALL SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED.  IN MOST CASES THE<BR>
NEUROSURGICAL REGISTRAR WILL ALSO NEED TO BE INVOLVED.</B><BR>
<BR>
Management is directed towards the underlying disease.  However, in the intervening<BR>
period there are several therapies that will decrease the ICP.<BR>
<BR>
<!-- List Tag -->
<UL>
<LI>Elevate head of bed - do not lay patient flat<BR>
<LI>Give mannitol 0.5 gram / kg IV or lasix 1 mg/kg IV in less severe cases<BR>
<LI>Hyperventilate.  Indications for intubation are GCS &lt; 8, or any pupil dilation.<BR>
Patient should be ventilated to a PaCO2 of around 30 mmHg<BR>
<LI>Dexamethasone 0.5 - 1 mg/kg IV is particularly useful in vasogenic cerebral
oedema<BR>
- eg. CNS tumours<BR>
<LI>Avoid hypotension.  Blood pressure should be maintained with a mean arterial<BR>
pressure &gt;= normal for age in order to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure<BR>
(CPP = MAP - ICP)

<body vlink="#B90003" background=spiral_page.gif><blockquote>
<center><H1>Shock &amp; Sepsis<HR></H1></center>
<h2>Definition :</h2>	Shock is a state of circulatory dysfunction in which tissue O<sub>2</sub> delivery is less than required.  If untreated, multi-organ failure and death result.  Shock is the final common pathway of numerous disease states.<p>
<BR>
<h2>Aetiology:</h2>	Can be broadly classified into the following categories:
<UL>
<LI>Hypovolaemic<BR>
<LI>Cardiogenic<BR>
<LI>Septic<BR>
<LI>
<A HREF="#addison">Endocrine</A><BR>
<LI><A HREF="#anaphylaxis">Anaphylactic</A><p>
</UL>
<h2>Clinical signs:</h2>

Clinical signs are for the most part non-specific, and include tachycardia, hypotension - particularly decreased diastolic BP, gallop rhythm, oliguria, and altered consciuosness.  Additional signs of specific underlying disorder should be sought.<p>
<BR>
<h2>Management:</h2>
Management is generally supportive.  Specific treatment for the underlying disorder is unlikely to be effective in the short term with the exception of adrenaline in anaphylaxis or hydrocortisone in Addisonian crisis.  As specific therapy will lead to dramatic improvement in these patients, it is critical to consider both conditions early in the resuscitation and treat appropriately.<p>
<BR>
<h3>
<A NAME="anaphylaxis">Anaphylaxis</A></h3>
Anaphylaxis is differentiated by a possible history of exposure to triggering event (ingestion of nuts or seafood, bee sting, etc), together with clinical features of stridor and wheeze, often with swelling of the mouth and tongue or around a bite site.  Hereditary angio-neurotic oedema (HANE) is a special case of anaphylactic shock where an enzyme deficiency (C<sub>1q</sub> esterase) - which may be dominantly inherited or arise as a spontaneous mutation - results in uncontrolled complement pathway activation presenting clinically as anaphylaxis without an identifiable trigger.  Adrenaline should be titrated against symptoms in 10 ug/kg doses (=0.1 ml/kg of 1:10,000) IV.  FFP may be useful for patients with HANE as it contains C<sub>1q</sub> esterase.<p>
<BR>
<H3><A NAME="addison">Addisonian crisis</A></H3>
Addisonian crisis should be suspected in patients abruptly withdrawn from chronic steroid therapy, but is more likely to present de novo in early infancy from variants of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), congenital adrenal hypoplasia, or rarely adrenoleucodystrophy - clues to CAH are ambiguous genitalia or hyperpigmentation of male genitalia; electrolyte disturbances of hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia are also common, as is hypoglycaemia.  Patients with known glucocorticoid deficiencies on replacement therapy may also present if steroid doses are not increased appropriately during intercurrent infections or other stressful events.  Rarely, addisonian crisis may complicate meningococcal sepsis (Waterhouse-Friderichson Sydrome, with bilateral adrenal haemorrhagic infarction), and hydrocortisone should be considered in patients with meningococcal disease and refractory hypotension.  Hydrocortisone doses are 50 mg IV for infants - toddlers, and 100 - 150 mg IV for older children - adults.<p><BR>
<H2>Management for all Shocked Patients</H2>
Otherwise, management is similar for all shocked patients:<p>
<UL><LI>Establish parenteral access, preferably with 2 IV lines.  If IV access cannot be established, an intra-osseous cannula should be placed.<BR>
<LI>Provide supplemental O<sub>2</sub><BR>.
<LI>If cardiogenic shock (eg myocarditis, ventricular arrhythmias etc) is excluded, give colloid in 10 ml/kg boluses until BP and HR return to acceptable levels. Cardiogenic shock - suggested by cardiomegally, peripheral and pulmonary oedema, low voltages on ECG, AV valvar regurgitation murmers - should be treated primarily with inotropes, with volume resuscitation used cautiously if at all.<br>
</UL>Further supportive treatment may include intubation and inotropic support :<p><UL>
<LI>Intubation should be considered for any patient with depressed consciousness (GCS &lt;= 8) secondary to shock.<BR>
<LI>Inotropic support should be considered for any patient unresponsive to colloid challenge of 40 - 50 ml/kg in total.  Inotrope selection will depend to some extent on aetiology, but dopamine at a starting dose of 5 - 10 ug/kg/min is a reasonable first choice in most situations (15 mg/kg in 50 ml D5 or NS at 1 - 2 ml/hour).<BR>
<LI>Antibiotics should be given in all cases of suspected septic shock, however fundamentals such as airway control and circulatory support must be addressed as a higher priority.  Ceftriaxone 100 mg/kg IV or IM provides good broad spectrum coverage in most situations.  Special cases such as neonates and immunosuppressed patients will require alternative or additional drugs (see unwell infants and febrile neutropaenia protocols).<p>

<H2><A NAME="assess">Initial Assessment</A></H2>
These notes emphasise the inpatient management of acute asthma. The first thing
to do when a child is admitted with acute asthma is to assess the severity of
the attack. It is useful to classify children with acute asthma into 4 groups
<A HREF="#severity">(mild, moderate, severe or in-extremis)</A> by taking a careful history and
performing a careful clinical examination. <p>
The dose and type of maintenance asthma medications required to control
symptoms between acute exacerbations, is useful information about the frequency
and severity of the patient's interval symptoms. Knowledge of the frequency of
&szlig;2 agonist administration prior to presentation to the emergency
department allows the clinical signs on presentation to be interpreted
correctly.<p>
During the examination look for the following :<p>
<!-- List Tag -->
<UL>
<LI>tachypnoea<br>
<LI>audible wheeze<br>
<LI>chest hyperinflation<br>
<LI>use of accessory muscles<br>
<LI>cyanosis in air<br>
<LI>chest auscultation<br>
<LI>pulsus paradoxus<br>
<LI>conscious state
</UL><p>
<b><u>NOTES:</u></b><p>
<!-- List Tag -->
<OL>
<LI>a patient with severe asthma may have a small tidal volume and therefore a wheeze may <b>not</b> be audible.<p>
<LI>the oxygen saturation of arterial blood (SaO2) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) may <b>not</b> be reliable indicators of the severity of airway obstruction, and must be interpreted in conjunction with the patient's clinical condition. <p>
<LI>a CXR is indicated in patients with severe respiratory distress or subcutaneous emphysema as they may have a pneumothorax. Patients with mild-moderate asthma do <b>not</b> usually require a chest X-ray.  The crepitations heard in asthma are usually due to mucus plugging and <b>not</b> a bacterial infection.
</OL><p>
<H2><A NAME="severity">Assessment of Severity</A></H2><p>
<OL>
<LI><b>Mild</b> - a child with mild asthma will have an audible wheeze but little
respiratory distress. There will be no palpable paradox and breath sounds over
the two hemithoraces will be normal. PEFR &gt; 50% predicted.

auscultation. Normal breath sounds bilaterally. PEF 30-50% predicted.<p>
<LI><b>Severe</b> - respiratory distress with the use of accessory muscles. Wheeze
may be minimal because of a small tidal volume, cyanosis in air and palpable

If the intravenous aminophylline is to be used in a patient on maintenance oral
theophylline, take blood for a theophylline level before commencing the
infusion. The loading dose needs to be varied according to the level using the

<H3>Periodic Assessment Once Treatment Has Commenced</H3>
A child with acute asthma needs frequent reassessment. This will be mainly
clinical but measurement of the PEF may be a useful objective method for
assessing improvement. When the intravenous line is removed the child should go
onto oral corticosteroids (1 mg/kg/day; max. 50 mg) and the dose tapered by
approximately 5 mg/day. If the child is on maintenance slow release
theophylline, this should be recommenced. If the child has not been on
maintenance theophylline, it should be <b>not</b> be commenced.<p>
<BR>
<H2><A NAME="interval">Assessment of Interval Asthma Symptoms</A></H2>
Any child admitted with an acute exacerbation of asthma should have his therapy
reviewed prior to discharge. In particular, a serum theophylline should be
checked if the child is receiving oral theophylline. <p>
The following questions are helpful in determining the severity of a patient's
asthma between acute exacerbations:<p>
<OL>
<LI>How often do you wake at night with wheeze or cough and need to use medication?<p>
<LI>How often do you wheeze or cough and have to use your medication when you wake in the morning?<p>
<LI>How often does wheeze, chest tightness or cough interfere with your sport or normal physical activity?<p>
<LI>How often do you have to use additional doses of bronchodilator because of wheezing or chest tightness? How long does a puffer last you? (A Ventolin puffer has 200 puffs therefore, if it lasts only 1 week, 28 puffs a day are being used).<p>
<LI>How much school do you miss because of asthma? <p>
</OL>
<BR>
<H2><A NAME="mx.interval">Management of Interval Symptoms</A></H2>
<H3>Infrequent Episodic Asthma</H3>
Exacerbations of asthma less frequently than every 3-4 weeks and usually in
association with a viral upper respiratory tract infection. These patients are
completely asymptomatic between exacerbations. They not usually require daily
asthma medications and are usually managed by inhalation of a &szlig;2 agonist
as required.<p>
<H3>Frequent Episodic Asthma</H3>
Frequent asthma symptoms occurring at least every 2-3 weeks but with
symptom-free intervals. These patients usually require inhaled cromoglycate or
corticosteroids to control their symptoms. As it has no known side-effects,
cromoglycate is the drug of first choice in patients with mild-moderate asthma
symptoms.<p>
<H3>Persistent asthma</H3>
Asthma symptoms on most days. These patients are managed with regular inhaled
corticosteroids to control their asthma symptoms. They may also require a long
acting bronchodilator (Serevent<sup>	</sup>).  These patients do not usually
require daily oral corticosteroids and/or oral theophylline.<p>
<BR>
<H2><A NAME="inhal">Inhalation Devices and Assessment of Technique</A></H2>
<b>Children less than 3 years of age</b> require a nebuliser or puffer via a
small volume spacer with a face mask, such as an Aerochamber or a
Breath-a-Tech. The child should breathe normally from the spacer for 20-30
seconds. No more than 2 puffer doses should be used in the spacer at any one
time.<p>
<b>Children who are 3 years or older </b>should be able to use a large volume
(750 ml) spacer without a face mask (e.g. Volumatic, Nebuhaler) and take 4 or 5
<b>slow</b> deep breaths on command. The child does not need to hold his/her
breath and must not pant from the spacer.<p>
<b>Children over the age of 7 years</b> may use a Turbuhaler, Rotahaler or
other dry powder device, or a puffer with a spacer device. <p>
When using turbuhalers to give inhaled corticosteroids, the patient must be
instructed to mouth rinse and spit out after the dose. If using a puffer, it
should <b>always</b> be used with a spacer device for the delivery of inhaled
corticosteroids. The use of a spacer and mouth rinsing will significantly
increase the pulmonary deposition of the drug and also reduce the oropharyngeal
and total body drug deposition, and reduce the risk of unwanted local and
systemic side-effects. <p>
<BR>
<H2><A NAME="plan">Asthma Management Plan</A></H2>
All children should have an individually devised asthma management plan
outlining the continuing management of their acute exacerbation and the
recommencement of their regular maintenance therapy (if necessary). A written
crisis plan for the management of future acute exacerbations should also be
provided. <p>
<b>In general, a patient with an acute exacerbation of asthma requiring inhaled
bronchodilators more often than every 2-3 hours should seek medical advice and
treatment.</b><p>
For frequent <b>severe</b> acute exacerbations of asthma, consider:<p>
<UL>
<LI>placing the patient's name on the MICA priority list.<br>
<LI>giving home oxygen to drive the home nebuliser. <br>
</UL>These services may be arranged after consultation with the Paediatric
Respiratory Physician (Dr. Freezer).<p>
<BR>
<H2>Follow Up</H2>
It is essential that follow-up is arranged for every child admitted with asthma
by either the local GP (in which case he/she should be phoned), or a
Paediatrician.<p>

<B>Moderate</B> - Respiratory rate 40-70/min, mildly cyanosed in air, some difficulty feeding.<p>
<B>Severe</B> - Respiratory rate &gt; 70/min, cyanosed in air, not feeding.<p>
<br>
<H2>Management</H2><p>
<UL><LI><B>Mild </B>- Nurse in an ordinary cot and continue oral feeding.<p>
<LI><B>Moderate</B> - Nurse in oxygen. If not dehydrated, wait 2-4 hours for the
baby to settle and then try oral feeds in the oxygen cot. If they will not feed
orally, insert an IV and give 0.18% saline and 4% dextrose at 80% normal
maintenance requirements. If the child is unable to take sufficient volumes
of fluids orally, fluids are to be given intravenously. The use of nasogastric
feeds increases the risk of aspiration and clinical deterioration. <p>
Quarter hourly observations of pulse rate, respiratory rate and colour until
the baby has settled.<p>
<LI><B>Severe </B>- Nurse flat on abdomen in an oxygen cot or head box with an FiO2
of 60-70%. Commence IV fluids as above. Avoid any unnecessary disturbance. Use
a monitor to record the pulse rate and ask the nursing staff to record quarter
hourly pulse rate, respiratory rate and colour. Consider pulse oximetry and
blood gases if the baby does not settle. <p>
<LI><B>Transfer to Paediatric ICU</B> if the PaCO2 is &gt; 75 mmHg, if the baby is
very distressed or there are any apnoeic episodes.</UL><p>

<H3>Investigations</H3><p>
<OL>
<LI>NPA for immunofluorescence and culture.<br>
<LI>CXR - In Radiology if mild to moderate respiratory distress; on the ward if severe respiratory distress.
</OL><p>
<BR>
<H3>Progress</H3><p>
The baby is taken out of oxygen when it is feeding well. Discharge is
usually 24 hours after coming out of oxygen even if there are residual physical
signs in the chest.<p>
<BR>
<H3>Follow-up</H3><p>
The majority of infants do not require follow-up. The patients who should be
seen after discharge are those with extensive radiological changes, those who
were very ill, and those with unusual features (eg failure to thrive).<p>
<B>Remember</B> that many other conditions can present with a bronchiolitis
picture such as CF, pneumonia, congenital lung or heart disease, milk
inhalation etc.<p>

<H2><A NAME="introduction">Introduction</A></H2><p>
Cystic fibrosis occurs in about 1 in 2,500 births in Victoria. All patients are
seen at the Royal Children's Hospital at the time of diagnosis, which is
usually in the first year of life. Some patients living in the south-east of
the city or eastern Victoria are cared for jointly by the department of
Thoracic Medicine at the RCH and the Department of Paediatric Respiratory
Medicine, MMC. <p>
The prognosis has improved very considerably over the last 20 years and most
patients now reach adulthood. In the ward the resident medical staff will see
patients who have acute flare-ups of chest infection and those with severe lung
disease. The 50% of patients who have little chest trouble are rarely admitted
to the ward, so staff are likely to have a biased view of the condition.<p>
The development of a very positive attitude by the parents from the time of
diagnosis seems to be very important in the prognosis. The handling of the
family at the time of diagnosis is carefully planned. If they are given a
gloomy outlook, this can be hard to change.<p>
<BR>
<H2>Inpatient Management</H2><p>
<H3><A NAME="poss_cf">Admission of Infants and Children with Possible CF</A></H3><p>
If the possibility of CF has been raised with the parents, the Consultant will
tell you. If it has not, the words 'Cystic Fibrosis' should not be mentioned to
the parents. If they ask why a sweat test is being done, say it is to sort out
the baby's problems. If they want further information they should speak to the
consultant. Once the diagnosis has been established, both parents will be seen
by the Consultant and the diagnosis given. If the parents ask for the result of
the sweat test prior to the interview, it is best to say that the result is not
yet available.<p>
The Paediatric Respiratory Physician will outline the patient management
following diagnosis.<p>
<BR>
<H3><A NAME="tune_up">Admission of a CF patient for Treatment of Exacerbation of Chest
Infection</A></H3><p>
Children admitted with an acute exacerbation are usually kept in hospital until
they have returned to their previous state or their condition has plateaued. A
'tune-up' is usually is for a period of two weeks. If further benefit is
anticipated from a longer admission then a patient may stay for a further week.
Admissions for more than 3 weeks are very unusual. <p>
<OL><LI><B>Physiotherapy</B><p>
Notify the Physiotherapist (Christine Blackburn) and
Dietitian (Alison Caiafa) of the patient's admission. The physiotherapist will
organise chest physiotherapy 2-3 times a day and the dietitian will order
appropriate meals from the diet kitchen.<p>
<LI><B>Antibiotics</B><p>
Insert a IV with a heparin lock. If after <B>2</B> attempts the RMO cannot
insert the IV, the Registrar should be called. If the cannula comes out between
11 p.m. and 7 a.m. it is normally replaced the following morning, unless the
child is very ill.<p>
To decide on antibiotics, consult the protocol currently used or the Paediatric
Respiratory Physician.<p>
<LI><B>Pancreatic Enzymes</B><p>
The dose of enzymes that the patient was receiving must be continued in
hospital. If malabsorption is suspected, send a stool specimen for fat globules
to the Microbiology Laboratory.<p>
<LI><B>Inhalations</B><p>
Most patients receive nebulised salbutamol before chest physiotherapy. Some
patients find inhaled hypertonic saline (6%) prior to chest physiotherapy, and
inhaled gentamicin (40mg) following chest physiotherapy beneficial however,
these agents are not given routinely for the management of an acute
exacerbation. <p>
<LI><B>Electrolyte powder</B><p>
All patients receive added salt in their diet either as electrolyte powder or
salt tablets. The dose may need to be increased during the summer months as the
salt loss from sweating increases.<p>
Infants under 2 years require approximately 1/4 teaspoon b.d. in winter and
t.d.s. in summer. Children over 2 years, 1/2 teaspoon.<p>
<LI><B>Pulmonary Function Tests</B>.<p>
These are performed in children over the age of 7 years in the Respiratory
Function Laboratory on the second floor in the Department of Respiratory
Medicine (ext. 2278). They are done on admission, at weekly intervals during
the admission and immediately prior to discharge.<p>
<LI><B>Chest X-Ray</B><p>
A chest x-ray should be performed if the patient is very unwell or if a CXR has
not been performed during the past 6 months.<p>

This is a simple method of measuring airway obstruction and it will detect
moderate or severe disease. The simplicity of the method is its main advantage.
It is measured using a standard Wright Peak Flow Meter or mini Wright Meter.
The needle must always be reset to zero before PEF is measured.<p>

<LI><b>Moderate</b> - Suprasternal and sternal retraction at rest. Child not
particularly distressed or anxious looking and drinking reasonably well.<p>
Watch fluid intake. Quarter hourly pulse and respiratory rate. If a child's
condition deteriorates with rising pulse, rising respiratory rate and the
appearance of restlessness then nebulised adrenaline (0.5 ml/kg of 1:1000
solution; maximum dose 5 ml) or intubation is becoming urgent. <p>
<b>Note :</b>The administration of oxygen is only for the management of hypoxia

transfer.<p></UL>
The decision to give <b>nebulised adrenaline</b> is to be made by the Registrar
on duty in conjunction with Paediatric ICU. Children requiring adrenaline
nebulisers should be transferred to Paediatric ICU however, a single dose may
be given if the transfer cannot be effected safely without it. A member of the

A few children with severe persisting croup may require further doses of

<H3>Investigations for croup</H3><p>
The only investigation performed routinely is a NPA for viral
identification. Other investigations will usually be ordered after discussion
with the consultant - e.g. a lateral neck x-ray if the pattern of the stridor
is unusual.<p>
<BR>
<H3>Discharge</H3><p>
Children are normally discharged after they have had a relatively symptom free
night. For most children this generally means 2 nights in hospital.<p>
<BR>
<H3>Follow-up</H3><p>
Most children with croup are not followed up. Those who are include: all
intubated patients, prolonged stridor (&gt; one week), multiple episodes
(&gt;6), children under 6 months of age.<p>
<BR>
<H2>
<A NAME="epigot">Epiglottitis - A Medical Emergency</A></H2><p>
<b>Important Notes:</b><p>
<ol>
<LI>Most children with suspected epiglottitis are admitted directly to
Paediatric ICU as approximately 80-90% of patients will require intubation.<br>
<LI>Occasionally a child will reach the ward, usually with the diagnosis not
suspected. If the admitting doctor thinks epiglottitis is possible, he should
immediately contact the unit Registrar. If the Registrar is concerned, the
Paediatric ICU consultant should be contacted. Deaths have occurred when the
RMO thought that a child admitted with croup had epiglottitis but was not
sure, and decided to review the child in a short time before calling a
Registrar. The children died before the resident had the opportunity
to review the patient.<br>
<LI>The administration of oxygen is for the management of hypoxia while
admission to Paediatric ICU and intubation are being arranged. <b>Oxygen
therapy is not a substitute for the relief of the child's upper airway
obstruction.</b><br>
<LI>Transfer back from ICU: Most children will be transferred out of ICU shortly
after extubation. They should continue intravenous antibiotics until they are
drinking well.<p></ol>
<BR>
<H3>Discharge</H3><p>
Children are usually discharged 24 hours after extubation, providing they are
drinking well and able to take oral antibiotics. The antibiotics are continued
to complete a 5 day course.<p>
<BR>
<H3>Follow-up</H3><p>
All patients who are admitted with epiglottitis should be followed up by
the referring Paediatrician.<p>
<BR>
<H2>
<A NAME="inhal_FB">Inhaled Foreign Body</A></H2>
<OL><LI><B>Acute Presentation</B><br>
Children are admitted if the history is suggestive of foreign body inhalation
(eg abrupt onset of respiratory symptoms in a previously well child who was
playing with peanuts), the physical examination reveals asymmetry of the
physical signs in two hemithoraces and/or a CXR demonstrates air trapping in
one hemithorax during expiration.<p>
<LI><B>Late Presentation</B><br>
A missed foreign body may present with recurrent or persistent collapse or
consolidation (pneumonia) of a lobe, usually a lower lobe of the lung.<p>
</ol><BR>
<H3>Management</H3>
<ol><LI>Arrange good inspiratory and expiratory chest x-rays if they are not already
available. If there are only outside films these should be repeated or copied
for our records.<br>
<LI>Nil orally until a decision is made about the need and timing of
bronchoscopy by the appropriate surgical endoscopist.<br>
<LI>Physiotherapy is <b>contraindicated</b> in suspected inhaled foreign body.<p>
</ol><BR>
<H3>Prevention</H3><p>
Children less than 2 years of age should not be offered foods such as popcorn,
raw carrot sticks or apples. Toys with small component parts should also be
avoided in this age group. Peanuts should not be offered to children less than
4 years of age.<p>

<BR>
The Paediatric Sleep Disorders Unit is a sleep research and clinical facility in Melbourne,<BR>
 Australia, specifically dedicated to infants and children.  The Unit is located in the <BR>
Department of Paediatrics at Monash Medical Centre, and was established in 1978.  <BR>
The Unit aims to address a wide range of needs of both parents and doctors related to <BR>
sleep and breathing in infants and children.  The Unit provides:<P>
<A HREF="sleep.html#THE CLINICAL SERVICE">A clinical service</A> involving clinical assessment and full <A HREF="sleep.html#POLYSOMNOGRAPHY">polysomnography</A><BR>
for the diagnosis of sleep disorders in children. <P>

<BR>
<STRONG><A NAME="THE CLINICAL SERVICE">THE CLINICAL SERVICE</A><BR>
</STRONG><BR>
Referrals to the Unit are received from general practitioners, ear, nose and throat specialists<BR>
and paediatricians from across the State.  Infants and children who have problems in either<BR>
initiating or maintaining sleep are referred.  The major medical problem seen is <BR>
<B>Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS)</B>, while others include central <BR>
hypoventilation disorder, neuromuscular disorders, infants who have had an Apparent <BR>
Life Threatening Events (ALTE), and nocturnal epilepsy.  A major cause of sleep disorders <BR>
in babies and children are behavioural problems and parasomnias.  The Unit offers a full <BR>
clinical assessment, counselling and behavioural programmes for these and other sleep r<BR>
related problems.<BR>
<A NAME="POLYSOMNOGRAPHY"><BR></A><HR>

<BR>
<STRONG>POLYSOMNOGRAPHY</STRONG><P>
Polysomnographic studies are performed overnight with two to three studies being<BR>
performed each week.  The paediatric age group studied are from infants to adolescents.  <BR>
There is a 1:1 parent/staff ratio.  The physiological variables which are routinely measured <BR>
are EEG, EOG, EMG, nasal airflow, oral airflow, abdominal breathing effort, rib cage <BR>
breathing effort, expired CO2, transcutaneous CO2, oxygen saturation (SpO2) and ECG.  <BR>
Other variables such as tidal volume, CPAP, rectal temperature and oesophageal pH are <BR>
added as required.  All physiological recordings are recorded via a Grass 16 channel <BR>
polygraph to a Compumedics computer S-series Sleep System.  Version 5 and data <BR>
is then stored on optical disk.   <P><HR>
<BR>
<STRONG><A NAME="RESEARCH">RESEARCH</A></STRONG><P>
Research studies currently being carried out are investigating various aspects of <BR>
arousal from sleep. A failure to arouse from sleep following a prolonged breathing <BR>
pause (apnoea) is a likely mechanism for <B>Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)</B>. <P>
Our group has developed a unique stimulus which invariably produces cortical arousal <BR>
in infants, but which is non-threatening and harmless. The use of this stimulus, a <BR>
pulsatile jet of air applied to the nostrils, has allowed us to carry out longitudinal <BR>
studies of arousability in normal full term infants over the past six years. <P>
We have established that infants are more difficult to arouse from quiet sleep than from<BR>
active sleep, and that the threshold at which they arouse in quiet sleep is highest at two to <BR>
three months of age, a period which coincides with the peak incidence of SIDS. <BR>
Presently we are carrying out arousal studies in two groups of infants considered to <BR>
be at increased risk for SIDS: preterm infants and infants who have previously <BR>
suffered an Apparent Life Threatening Event (ALTE).  Proposed studies for 1996 <BR>
will investigate the relationships between maternal smoking, sleeping position and <BR>
respiratory infection and arousal in both term and preterm infants.<P>

<P><HR><P>
The objectives of the home monitoring program are to:
<UL><LI>Provide an efficient and effective <B>service to parents</B> caring at home for<BR> a child at risk of sudden death, or perceived risk of sudden death.<P>
<LI>Undertake <A HREF="#research">research</A> of significance into home monitoring.
</UL>
<HR>

<FONT SIZE=4><B><A NAME="CLINICAL">The Clinical Service</A></B></FONT><P>
The Home Monitoring Program operates as a clinical specialty providing a service to parents 
or primary care givers of neonates and infants under the care of their doctor.  The Program also provides a resource for hospital and community based health workers including paediatricians, general practitioners, maternal and child health nurses, midwives, clinical engineers and social workers.
<P>
Many parents are highly distressed at the time of referral and often require immediate attention.  Paediatricians frequently request a monitor immediately prior to an infants' discharge from hospital and discharge is contingent on the provision of a monitor.<P>

Counselling and information on all aspects of monitoring are provided to parents or health professionals. Parents are given verbal and written instructions on the function, use and maintenance of the monitor.  Appropriate response to an alarm and infant resuscitation are also demonstrated.<P>

A telephone support service for parents during working hours, and a twenty-four hour contact point is available for both service and psychological support.<P>
The service will be operated in 1996 by <A HREF="numa.html">Dr. A. Numa</A> and 
<A HREF="walker.html">Dr. C. Walker</A>.<P>
<HR>
<H4><!-- Anchor Point Tag -->
<A NAME="research">HOME MONITORING RESEARCH</A></H4>
Researchers at Monash University and the University of Melbourne are currently 
undertaking a three year prospective study of the emotional impact on families who are 
monitoring a vulnerable infant at home.  This project is funded by the National SIDS Council of Australia.<P>

Parents use home monitors in caring for their infants to help minimise the possibility of 
infant mortality.  Parents seek monitoring for both medical and psychological reasons and 
the controversy lies in whether the home monitoring service effectively reduces or exacerbates 
parental anxiety.  For this reason it is important to examine the relationship between home 
monitoring and emotional distress.<P>

The present study examines the impact of using a monitor in babies who have suffered an Apparent Life Threatening Event (ALTE) or are subsequent siblings of a Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) infant.  Participating in the study are 160 parents who, at pre-determined times, complete a series of questionnaires and participate in a comprehensive semi-structured interview.<P>

RN RM BApplSci(Nsg).
<P><HR><p>
PhD Student	Department of Paediatrics, commencing February 1996.<p>
<p>I have been the co-ordinator of the 
<A HREF="sids.html">Home Monitoring Program</A> at Monash Medical
Centre since 1991.  This program provided a contact for families or health
professionals who were concerned that an infant may experience a
life-threatening apnoea at home combining counselling, education and infant
apnoea monitors.  My interests include the impact loss and bereavement on
families with a young infant (in particular SIDS, reproductive loss and the
threat of loss), and the ways in which families manage these experiences.<p>

I am co-chief investigator of a three year prospective study of the emotional
impact on families who are monitoring a vulnerable infant at home.  The team
involved in the project include 
<A HREF="adamson.html">Michael Adamson</A> and Jenny MacLeod from the
Department of Paediatrics, Jane Fisher from the Key Centre for Women's health
at the University of Melbourne, and Andrew Stocky, Director of the Mother and
Baby Units at the Melbourne Clinic and Monash Medical Centre.  The project is
funded by the National SIDS Council of Australia.<p>

The study examines the impact of using a monitor in babies who have suffered
an Apparent Life Threatening Event (ALTE) or are subsequent siblings of a
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) infant.  Participating in the study are 160
parents who, at pre-determined times, complete a series of questionnaires and
participate in a comprehensive semi-structured interview.  It is expected that
the research will be completed in 1996<p>

<p><font size="5"><b><u>Aims</u></b></font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font size="3">To provide a scientific basis for the
        study of cardiovascular medicine.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">To provide core knowledge about the
        development, anatomical localisation and structural
        features of the heart and vasculature.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">To provide core knowledge about the
        physiological principles which underlie cardiac function
        and the behaviour of the circulation</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">To provide an introduction to
        cardiovascular pharmacology.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">To introduce preliminary ideas about
        clinical cardiovascular problems.</font></li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="5"><b><u>Objectives</u></b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">At the completion of this unit, students should
have a good working knowledge of the cardiovascular system and be
able to:</font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font size="3">Describe the normal development of the
        heart and vascular system.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Describe the pump function, the electrical
        activity of the heart and underlying mechanisms of
        excitation-contraction coupling.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Describe the peripheral circulation and
        its role in venous return.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Describe arterial blood pressure and its
        regulation.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Describe cardiovascular reflex responses
        to physiological stimuli.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Describe the properties of commonly
        prescribed cardiovascular pharmacological agents.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Develop an understanding of the importance
        of working from basic principles (eg. anatomical,
        physiological) when approaching issues of problem solving
        in clinical cardiovascular medicine.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Explore further the scientific basis of
        medicine through pursuits in cardiovascular research.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Move smoothly and confidently into the
        clinical years of the medical course where this knowledge
        will be applied and built upon as the student develops an
        appreciation of cardiovascular disease, the major cause
        of morbidity and mortality in the Australian community.</font></li>

<p align="center"><a name="4th Year"><font color="#800040"
size="6" face="Arial"><b><u>4th Year</u></b></font></a></p>

<p>No dermatology teaching occurs until 4th Year, when ten
lectures are given. These are:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>(i) <strong><u>Introduction to Dermatology</u></strong>.
    The aim of this lecture is to introduce students to the
    assessment of dermatological problems. This includes relevant
    history taking, description and terminology of skin lesions
    and rashes, and investigative techniques.</p>
    <p>(ii) <strong><u>Skin tumours - benign and malignant</u></strong><u>.</u>
    Common benign and malignant skin tumours are discussed and
    many examples are shown. Important tumours emphasized here
    include seborrhoeic keratoses, epidermal cysts, other benign
    tumours of epidermal and dermal constituents, solar
    keratoses, basal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas
    and malignant melanomas. Students are expected to know brief
    details of epidemiology, appearance and appropriate
    treatment.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><u>(iii) </u><strong><u>Dermatological problems in
    adolescents/elderly</u></strong><u>.</u> Acne is discussed.
    Students are expected to understand the pathogenesis,
    descriptions of lesions and principles of treatment. The
    existence of other factors contributing to acne is also
    mentioned, such as cosmetics and drugs.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Common skin conditions in the elderly are mentioned
        along with benign tumours, vascular disorders, hair
        changes, wrinkles and causes of pruritus. It is
        considered important that students realise that many
        systemic conditions may cause generalised pruritus in the
        elderly, which often needs to be investigated.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><u>(iv) </u><strong><u>Bullous diseases</u></strong>.
    Common causes of bullous diseases include drug eruptions,
    infections and erythema multiforme, while rarer conditions
    include the blistering disorders. It is considered important
    that students recognise that there are a variety of
    blistering eruptions caused by different mechanisms, many
    involving antibodies. Histology of the skin, together with
    immunofluorescence is often necessary to make a diagnosis.</p>
    <p><u>(v) </u><strong><u>Skin infections</u></strong><u>.</u>
    Many types of viral, bacterial and fungal infections are
    discussed and examples shown. Appropriate investigations and
    treatment are considered.</p>
    <p>(vi) <strong><u>Eczema and dermatitis</u></strong>.
    Examples of endogenous eczema and exogenous dermatitis are
    given. Students are expected to have some knowledge of the
    treatment principles in eczema, and recognise that patch
    testing is the investigation of choice in the diagnosis of
    allergic contact dermatitis.</p>
    <p><u>(vii) </u><strong><u>Major cutaneous reaction patterns</u></strong><u>.</u>
    Conditions such as erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme,
    lichen planus, urticaria, lupus erythematosus and vasculitis
    are discussed. Students are expected to understand that the
    skin reacts in a relatively limited number of ways and
    sometimes it is necessary to consider a list of possible
    contributing causes.</p>
    <p>(viii) <strong><u>Psoriasis and papulosquamous eruptions</u></strong>.
    Psoriasis in its various manifestations is discussed in
    detail. Other similar appearing conditions are discussed such
    as pityriasis rosea and pityriasis versicolor.</p>
    <p>(ix) <strong><u>Pathology of skin tumours</u></strong>.
    Normal skin structure is reviewed, along with the definition
    of important histological terms. The lecture is divided into
    the pathology of benign skin tumours, pre-malignant tumours
    and malignant skin tumours. The concept of tumour thickness
    and level is introduced for the staging of malignant
    melanoma.</p>
    <p><u>(x) </u><strong><u>Inflammatory skin disease</u></strong><u>.</u>
    The major tissue reaction patterns are introduced such as
    lichenoid, psoriasiform, spongiotic, vesicular, bullous,
    granulomatous and vasculopathic. Examples of these are shown
    and discussed.</p>
    <p><u>(xi) </u><strong><u>Laboratory training</u></strong><u>.</u>
    Two microbiology sessions are held around the time of the
    lecture series to highlight this material.</p>
    <p>(xii) <strong><u>Prevention of skin cancer and
    occupational skin disease</u></strong><u>.</u> This lecture
    is given under the auspices of the Department of Social and
    Preventative Medicine. Ideally it would follow the lecture
    series as it did in 1994 but this was not the case in 1995.
    There is discussion of the mechanism of skin damage caused by
    ultraviolet light and subsequently important issues in
    prevention of skin tumours. There is discussion of the common
    occupational skin diseases and in particular causes of
    contact dermatitis and many examples are shown.</p>
    <p>(xiii) <strong><u>Monash Medical Centre</u></strong><u>.</u>
    No further 4th Year training</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>(xiv) <strong><u>Alfred Hospital</u></strong><u>.</u></p>

<p><font size="5"><u>Monash Medical Centre</u></font></p>

<p>Two informal lecture/tutorials are given to each group of
students (4).</p>

<blockquote>
    <ol type="i" start="1">
        <li><u>Skin Cancer.</u> This includes more detail on
            epidemiology, appearance and treatment of
            non-melanocytic skin cancer and discussion of the
            effects of ultraviolet light and use of sunscreens is
            included. Many pigmented lesions are reviewed
            including naevi and in particular early diagnosis of
            melanoma is emphasized. There is also discussion of
            prognosis, risk factors and treatments.</li>
        <li><u>Skin signs of internal malignancy.</u>
            Classification is presented and many examples are
            shown.</li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="5"><u>Alfred Hospital.</u></font></p>

<p>In addition students also attend four out-patient clinics.
Three lectures are given to two groups of students:</p>

<blockquote>
    <ol type="i" start="1">
        <li>Skin cancer</li>
        <li>Eczema and Psoriasis</li>
        <li>Skin infections including acne, acneiform eruptions
            and leg ulcers</li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="5"><u>Community Medicine.</u></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Community medicine, infections are discussed, with
            emphasis on viral exanthems</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="5"><u>Paediatric Dermatology.</u></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>A one hour lecture is given which includes discussion
            of common paediatric skin problems such as eczema.
            Birth marks and other congenital problems are also
            introduced together with ichthyosis and common
            infections.</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="5"><u>Monash Medical Centre</u></font></p>

<ul>
    <li>Students attend outpatient clinic for four or five
        sessions depending on public holidays. The emphasis is on
        showing them cases although no patients are brought in
        especially. In particular various benign skin lesions are
        shown.</li>
    <li>Additional didactic teaching is given before the clinic
        in a few areas thought not to be well covered in the
        lecture series. This includes warts, hair disorders,
        treatment of itchy skin, patch testing, acne and a quiz
        section.</li>
</ul>

<p><font size="5"><u>Alfred Hospital</u></font></p>

<ul>
    <li>Students attend three outpatient clinics where they see a
        variety of conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p><font size="5"><u>Community Medicine.</u></font></p>

<ul>
    <li>Common skin conditions are presented.</li>
</ul>

<p><font size="5"><u>Seminar.</u></font></p>

<ul>
    <li>Dr. John Kelly, dermatologist and Mr. John Anstee,
        plastic surgeon combine to present a seminar on melanoma.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="Core Teaching"><font size="5"><em><b><u>Core
Teaching:</u></b></em></font></a></p>

<p>It is considered reasonable that students have some
understanding of these topics and therefore attempts have been
made to introduce them over the teaching period. Unfortunately
most of the teaching time occurs early on when the students are
least equipped to handle it. Therefore the layering of this
information in 5<sup>th </sup>Year and 6<sup>th</sup> Year is
considered extremely important.</p>

<ol type="i" start="1">
    <li>Approach to dermatological case, including history
        taking, use of correct terminology, common
        investigations.</li>
    <li>Recognition of common skin lesions including malanocytic
        naevi, benign and malignant skin tumours.</li>
    <li>Management of skin cancer, including melanoma,</li>
    <li>Eczema, contact dermatitis and occupational skin disease.</li>
    <li>Psoriasis</li>
    <li>Skin infections, including tinea, bacterial infections,
        pityriasis versicolorz scabies, viral infections.</li>
    <li>Drug eruptions.</li>
    <li>Blistering diseases.</li>
    <li>Acne.</li>
    <li>Skin diseases in the elderly, including pruritus.</li>
    <li>Cutaneous signs of malignancy.</li>
    <li>Hair disorders.</li>
    <li>Paediatric dermatology</li>
    <li>Viral exanthems</li>
</ol>

<p>Other skin conditions including pityriasis rosea, urticaria,
erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, lichen planus, lupus,
vasculitis, warts, leg ulcers.</p>

<p>Early detection, continuing care and palliative care of people
with cancer is an integral component of Australian general
practice. It is therefore an important part of the teaching
provided to undergraduate medical students by the Department of
Community Medicine at Monash University.</p>

<p>The main teaching occurs in the final year rotation in
community medicine. Dr Michael Kidd runs a three hour teaching
block on palliative care in general practice. This includes a
small group seminar on community-based palliative care in
Victoria, the importance of general practitioners and other
health professionals in terminal care in community, nursing home
and private hospital settings and the causes and locations of
death in this state. The role of the general practitioner in the
management of cancer and HIV/AIDS is particularly emphasised.</p>

<p>Students are then led through a series of case studies and
develop twelve &quot;rules&quot; for caring for the terminally
ill in the community. This includes role playing the management
of difficult situations such as breaking the bad news and
supporting bereaved family members.</p>

<p>An additional 90 minutes is devoted to the final year students
practicing their evolving skills in the management of a number of
difficult clinical scenarios in the care of people with cancer as
part of the department&#146;s Consulting Skills Program of
Patient Management.</p>

<p>Students utilise the self-directed learning material in the
departmental learning laboratories during their &#145;spare&#146;
time. There are computer-based patient management problems
dealing with terminal care issues, including the home care and
medical management of a terminally ill man with AIDS who makes a
request for euthanasia.</p>

<p>Final year students are exposed to community-based palliative
care through their four day attachment to metropolitan general
practice and particularly during their two week attachment to
rural general practice. This teaching is obviously variable and
each student has an individual experience which is dependent on
the number of terminally ill patients their supervising general
practitioner currently has in his or her care.</p>

<p>Issues relating to palliative care are also raised during the
early clinical contact visits of the medical students in first,
second and third year and in their weekly tutorials with their
clinical tutors during each of these years.</p>

<p>A two hour forum on &quot;Death and Dying&quot; is held in
fourth year. This involves a panel discussing issues surrounding
the management of people who are terminally ill. The panel
usually includes a general practitioner, an oncologist, a grief
counsellor, a palliative care nurse, Fracis MacNab and Ian
Gawler.</p>

<p>The students also conduct an assignment during their general
practice visit in fourth year where they look at cancer
preventive and early detection measures utilised by general
practitioners.</p>

<p>Finally the department&#146;s Postgraduate Diploma of General
Practice has a major unit on Palliative care devised by Dr Trevor
Banks</p>

    <p><a name="WHAT IS PALLIATIVE CARE?"><font size="4"
    face="Arial"><strong><u>WHAT IS PALLIATIVE CARE?</u></strong></font></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The World Health Organisation (WHO 1990) defines palliative
care as :</p>

<p>&quot;The active total care of patients at a time when their
disease is no longer responsive to curative measures and when
control of pain and other symptoms and of psychological, social
and spiritual problems is paramount. The goal of palliative care
is the highest possible quality of life for the patient and
family.&quot;</p>

<p>Palliative care affirms life and regards dying as a normal
process. It emphasises relief from pain and other distressing
symptoms; integrates the physical, psychological and spiritual
aspects of patient care; offers a support system to help the
patient live as actively as possible until death and to help the
family during the patient's illness and in bereavement.
Palliative care stresses advanced planning rather than crisis
intervention.</p>

<p>Finlay &amp; Jones (1995) have described three distinct but
interconnected aspects of palliative care:</p>

<ul>
    <li>the palliative approach, which should be a core
        skill-base of all clinicians,</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The palliative approach is relevant to all patients
        with incurable conditions. It emphasises the importance
        of considering psychosocial and spiritual aspects as well
        as the purely physical. It includes consideration of
        family and domestic carers. Most specialities and all
        general practitioners look after patients with life
        threatening diseases; attention to the patients' concerns
        and fears can guide management and ensure appropriate
        interventions. A palliative approach should be a core
        skill of every clinician, who may seek expert specialist
        help to ensure the best possible quality of life for the
        patient.</p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<ul>
    <li>palliative interventions, which are often carried out by
        other medical or allied health specialists (eg
        radiotherapy, surgery and physiotherapy) and</li>
    <li>specialist palliative care, which is delivered by
        specialist clinicians in the context of a dedicated
        multidisciplinary team Students should be equipped as
        undergraduates in the <i>approach, </i>be aware of the
        role of appropriate <i>interventions </i>and know when to
        refer to or consult a <i>specialist </i>team.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="2.1.1 CORE VALUES"><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong>2.1.1

    <li>The best possible pain and symptom relief in the clinical
        circumstances is a patient's right and a doctor's duty.
        Inadequate expertise is not a defence of sub-optimal care
        as specialist help and support are available.</li>
    <li>Dying is a natural part of living, and death is an
        inevitable consequence of having life. No amount of
        medical progress can change this fact. Whilst we have a
        duty to try to preserve our patient's lives, this does
        not mean that we are obliged to treat the dying as if
        they can be cured.</li>
    <li>Grief, loss and bereavement are intrinsic parts of all of
        our lives. An understanding of the patterns of human
        grief behaviour is necessary and the ability to support
        grieving people is a core skill of being a doctor.</li>
    <li>A person's dying days are of just as much value as their
        non-dying ones.</li>
    <li>A person has a right to have their beliefs, needs and
        wishes recognised and respected at all stages of their
        lives, including when they are dying.</li>
    <li>Dealing with death and dying is an intrinsic part of
        medical practice but we should guard against
        over-medicalisation of the process of dying.</li>
    <li>Care based on viewing the patient's needs in the context
        of the whole person rather than a series of (medically
        defined) parts (so-called holistic care).</li>
    <li>Appropriately negotiated treatment abatement and symptom
        relief do not constitute causing death.</li>

<blockquote>
    <p>Many people express surprise that a doctor would want to
    work with dying people (&quot;it must be so depressing&quot;)
    but all doctors have to at some stage in their careers. All
    interns, residents, registrars, many specialists and all
    general practitioners look after dying people. Those who do
    so effectively will tell you how professionally and
    personally satisfying it can be. Like most aspects of
    practice doctors derive satisfaction from things they do well
    and in order to do them well some preparation and training is
    necessary. Historically, this has been lacking until
    recently.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In medicine we tend to be predominantly task-orientated
    and driven by technology. Caring for a dying person and their

    <p>probably does not sound as dramatic, but the
    attitude-knowledge-skill mix required to do palliative care
    well is complex, interesting and rewarding.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Traditionally, students and doctors have tended to be
    cynical about the value of formal learning in this area.
    After all people have always died and doctors have looked
    after them, so what is the problem? Medicine was almost
    exclusively focused on cure and the medical role in caring
    for dying people was seen as minimal e.g. &quot;now is the
    time for masterly inactivity&quot;. The fact of the matter is
    that in the absence of almost any formal teaching most
    doctors had to teach themselves by 'learning on the job'.
    Some did very well but many struggled and patients suffered.</p>

    people to go to die. The pioneers of this movement, initially
    in Britain, and eventually in most countries of the world,
    wanted to change the whole approach of doctors and health

TEACHING METHODS</strong></font></a></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The educational approach of this three week course is
    PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING (PBL for short). This is a teaching
    method that moves the emphasis in learning from the teacher
    to the students, from passive (e.g. lectures) to active (e.g.
    student led seminars) and from fact-learning to
    problem-solving. In its most pure form the students define
    and design the learning task, including deciding what should
    be learnt. This is always a limitation in a vocational
    subject like medicine where a substantial amount of
    experience is necessary to know what needs to be learnt. The
    course is therefore designed around four problems derived
    from real-life clinical situations which you could face at
    any time, including your first week as an intern! Whilst the
    emphasis must always be on clinical relevance, it is
    important to spend a little time after clinical competence
    has been addressed on the fascinating scientific and
    intellectual challenges which this area of medicine
    generates.</p>

<p>This is an approach to medical education which really started
at a new Canadian medical school which was set up at McMaster
University, Hamilton, Ontario, in the 1960s. It has been
subsequently tried and evaluated at medical schools in various
countries including Harvard (the &quot;new path&quot; track), New
Mexico and here in Australia at Newcastle and in clinical skills
at Adelaide. The usual PBL approach is to formulate clinical
problems around the core elements of a given discipline. A
combination of basic science knowledge and clinical reasoning
skills are then employed by students to seek solutions to the
problems. The main features of the learning process are:</p>

</center></div>

<p>For each problem you will have access to some notes and
reference material. You are encouraged to approach staff members
for guidance. This course is therefore centred around four
problems. <font size="3" face="Arial"><b><i>All students should
prepare all four problems, but we recommend that you work in the
same pairs in which you see patients</i></b></font><i>. </i>This
spreads the load and encourages collaboration.</p>

<p>Your main initial task is to identify what attitudinal issues
might influence your approach to the problem. Then you need to
decide what knowledge and which skills you need to acquire.</p>

<p>The time available will restrict what we can reasonably
require of you. We are not looking for a slick presentation for
marks. We are looking for broad and open consideration of the
problems. Some out of hours reading and preparation
(&quot;homework&quot;) would be advisable but we do not want PBL
to be a burden. You are welcome to photocopy essential material
for PBL preparation (see departmental secretary).</p>

<p>You may find that you feel uncertain about the process and
feel that you are not getting enough information given to you. If
you stick with the process we hope that you will be pleasantly
surprised at the end. All the evaluations which have been done
show that students prefer PBL to traditional methods and
certainly enjoy it more.</p>

</b></font><font size="5" face="Arial"><b>WHEN MEETING PATIENTS </b></font></a><font
size="5" face="Arial"><b><br>
IN McCULLOCH HOUSE</b></font></p>

<p>We want you to enjoy your palliative care teaching and we know
that in previous years most students have rated encounters with
patients very highly, provided that there is adequate debriefing
afterwards.</p>

<p>As only ten of our beds are open and patients may be too ill
to see students, we are not able to guarantee patient contact for
all students in the Tuesday sessions. You will therefore be
allocated a patient to see (in pairs) and we suggest that you
arrange a mutually convenient time to return and conduct the
interview. If this is in the evening, you will need to try and
ensure that patients and visitors are advised of the time and are
happy with it.</p>

<p>Please check with a member of the nursing or medical staff as
to whether the patient agrees to be seen and whether they are
well enough.</p>

<p>Remember that although we encourage patients and families to
help in your education and most are happy to do so, it is a
patient's right to refuse at any time without any fear of
prejudicing their care.</p>

<p>Try to conduct the interview as a relaxed and reflective
dialogue. You are there to listen to the patient and you will
probably find that 30-45 minutes will be long enough. If you pick
up signs that the patient is tired or distressed by the interview
then you should ask the person this directly and withdraw if
appropriate. Make sure that your departure is gradual, courteous
and reassuring.</p>

<p>The main aims of the encounter are to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>find out how the patient is feeling physically and
        emotionally</li>
    <li>allow the patient to tell their story (this opportunity
        is usually very much valued)</li>
    <li>ascertain their hopes, fears and beliefs</li>
    <li>explore their thoughts about death and dying</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember to listen carefully, use open questions and don't be
afraid of silence. Questions like &quot;how do you feel about
that&quot; and &quot;how do you see things with your
illness&quot; or &quot;how do you see the future&quot; can be
valuable.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid to talk openly about death if the patient
indicates that they want to. If difficult questions are put to
you which you feel poorly equipped to deal with, say you will ask
a staff member to assist.</p>

<p>You may find the experience unsettling or even distressing. If
you wish to debrief immediately please approach one of the unit
staff for assistance or raise the issue(s) at the next session.</p>

<p>You will be asked to present your findings in the second and
third sessions, in small groups. Please take notes of your
impressions and findings. Please note that the precise details of
the medical history are NOT necessary.</p>

<p>If you wish to visit the patient again, we would encourage you
to do so if you have established a rapport with the patient and
family. Please ask a staff member.</p>

<p>You now need to think about what attitudes, knowledge and

you and your colleagues need to understand to deal with cancer
pain competently ?</p>

a positive attitude to diagnosis and treatment. <font size="3"
face="Arial"><b><i>Conceptualise</i></b></font><i> </i>pain is a
complex subjective experience, and an underlying principle of
management is that pain is what the patient says hurts. <font

person's pain in context of the whole person. There is more to
pain relief than drugs, crucial though they are. <font size="3"

opioid analgesia is addictive, and that if initiated too early
there will be &quot;nothing left for the end&quot;. <font

there is nearly 30 years of palliative care experience to show
that safe pain control practices have nothing to do with

</ul>

<p>Widespread disseminated intra-abdominal disease appears to
interfere with normal gut motility and sphincter function.</p>

<p>Constipation in palliative care practice is not just a rectal
problem, think of the whole gastrointestinal tract. Faecal
loading in the ascending and transverse colons are just as likely
to be responsible as rectal loading.</p>

<p>It may be worthwhile to look briefly again at the physiology
of normal defaecation and bowel continence, see Oxford textbook
of Palliative Medicine pp 299-301.</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Aims of bowel care</strong></font></p>

<p>Normal bowel function is unlikely to be a realistic goal for
most patients requiring palliative care. Bowel care should
address the following:</p>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Avoidance of pain and discomfort (abdominal
            distension; rectal overload; straining)</li>
        <li>Maintainance of dignity (avoidance of incontinence
            and soiling)</li>
        <li>Prevention of nausea and vomiting</li>
        <li>Prevention of faecal impaction of the rectum (hard or
            soft)</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>INITIAL ASSESSMENT</b></font></p>

<ul>
    <li>Personal bowel history (what was normal for that person
        prior to illness)</li>
    <li>Surgical history (e.g. stoma)</li>
    <li>Abdominal examination<ul>
            <li>is distension present or not</li>
            <li>percussion note dull or tympanic</li>
            <li>organomegaly or palpable tumour</li>
            <li>rebound tenderness</li>
            <li>bowel sounds present or absent, if present normal
                or increased</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Perianal and rectal examination<ul>

        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Beware of constipation with overflow (spurious
        diarrhoea). Clinical features may include:<ul>
            <li>foul liquid bowel motions</li>
            <li>incontinence (often nocturnal)</li>
            <li>distended abdomen with tympanic percussion note</li>

<ul>
    <li><font size="3">end of Year 3 - thorough knowledge of

        application in assessing renal function in patients.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">end of Year 5 - core knowledge completed
        in renal disease and its evaluation.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">end of Year 6 - as above but with greater
        depth of knowledge and perspective. Hopefully the

<p><a name="Fifth year clinical attachments"><font size="5"
face="Arial"><b><u>Fifth year clinical attachments.</u></b></font></a></p>

<p>There is no direct Geriatric Medicine input in this year.
However, students would be exposed to many geriatric medicine
problems during their Medicine and Surgery terms, but they are
taught by non-geriatricians (see comment later).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="Sixth Year"><font size="5" face="Arial"><b><u>Sixth
Year</u></b></font></a></p>

<ul>
    <li>Students participate in a six week course in Integrative
        Medicine, comprising Geriatric Medicine, Rehabilitation
        Medicine, Therapeutics, Public Health and Forensic
        Medicine. Students perform a two week clinical attachment
        in Geriatric Medicine.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Most of the formal geriatric teaching occurs during this
        Integrative Medicine block. Again, during their Medicine,
        Surgery and Community Medicine terms, students see a high
        proportion of elderly patients, but are taught by
        non-geriatricians.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Also, some of the Friday afternoon seminars relate to
        problems of the elderly. Clinical teachers of the
        Geriatric Medicine attachment noted that there was a
        generally low standard of clinical skills (history and
        physical examination), at the commencement of final year.
        The clinical teachers therefore had to expend time in
        teaching and revising these skills, which were supposed
        to have been taught by other departments in third and
        fourth years.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Surveys of students showed that they were generally very
        positive about this final year course. However, many
        students requested that, since many of the patients they
        had seen in fifth year were elderly, and they felt they
        had not been taught or shown an adequate approach to the
        elderly, an introduction to Geriatric Medicine should be
        added earlier in the course, as well as the sixth year.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>A copy of the Integrative Medicine Handbook is available
        from the Department of Social and Preventive Medicine.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a 50 hour integrative unit, containing 20 contact
hours in pharmacology. The introduction to pharmacology begins
with consideration of drug-receptor interactions. This includes
discussion of the cellular and subcellular sites of drug action,
the concept of drug receptors, agonists and antagonists. The
concepts of intrinsic activity (efficacy), affinity and potency
of a drug will be covered</p>

<p>Concentration-response relationships and theories of
drug-receptor interactions will be introduced.</p>

<p>The subsequent lectures focus on the pharmacology of
neurotransmission; in particular, depression of nerve conduction
by local anaesthetics and other agents, and interference with
neurotransmission by agents affecting synthesis, storage,
release, the receptors or inactivation of transmitter. These
lectures will particularly illustrate important aspects of
cholinergic and adrenergic physiology and pharmacology within the
autonomic nervous system. Understanding in this area will aid
learning in the subsequent 'systems teaching' (e.g.
cardiovascular unit) and introduce drugs used clinically to
combat disease. A session on the action of various venoms and
toxins will be used to highlight principles discussed in the
preceding sessions.</p>

<p>This unit will conclude with an introduction to the physiology
and pharmacology of autacoids, substances thought to be released
either as neurotransmitters or local hormones and which appear to
be involved in many physiological and pathological processes.</p>

<p>Clinical Pharmacology is taught to the entire year in Final
Year during the 6 week Public Health block teaching program. The
aim of this six week block is to draw together the various
threads from the previous years' programmes so that the student
will integrate basic and applied knowledge in the area of
pharmacology and therapeutics into the clinical context in which
the drug is being prescribed. Clinical Pharmacology teaching in
Final year provides perhaps an opportunity to reinforce
principles of rational prescribing, drug addiction as an
occupational hazard and the obligations incumbant upon the
prescriber that will follow Graduation.</p>

<p>Final Year assessment in Clinical Pharmacology is by
multichoice question examination based around case histories.
Students undertake a comprehensive 60 question multichoice
practice examination in Clinical Pharmacology during the 6 week
block, in order to identify areas that require further expansion
of knowledge. Dr Krum then goes through each question the
following week to address specif1c issues in pharmacology raised
by the questions.</p>

<p>The teaching of third year medical neurosciences includes
didactic teaching about neurophysiology and neuroanatomy which is
principally borne by Drs. Rawson and Horne. There is also an
introduction to clinical skills with an emphasis on the practical
applications of neurophysiology and anatomy to clinical problems.</p>

<p>It is expected of students at the end of the third year to be
able to make neuroanatomical localisation of a lesion from a
simple clinical problem. They should also be able to carry out a
rudimentary neurological examination and take a history.</p>

lectures covering basic applied pathophysiology in neurology and
neurosurgery. Each student should receive three tutorials (at
MMC) on the clinical examination.</p>

<p>At the end of fourth year students should understand the
pathophysiology of the principal neurological and neurosurgical
disease processes and becoming increasingly competent at a
neurological history.</p>

<p>The didactic teaching is performed principally by neurologists
from the Alfred Hospital and Monash Medical Centre as well as
from the pathology and microbiology department. Bedside teaching
is performed by a range of clinicians.</p>

<p>Each combined surgical and neurological group receives an 8
week lecture program provided by the neurologists at Monash
Medical Centre. These are followed by a small group bedside
tutorial. The didactic program covers common neurological
problems and is designed to provide a therapeutic and diagnostic
approach to these common problems (e.g. headache, epilepsy,
paraparesis, hemiplegia, etc.)</p>

<p>Each fifth year group has 4 small group tutorials in
neurology. These include bedside tutorials, discussion of
clinical cases, discussion of signs presented by videotape etc.</p>

<p>It is expected that at the end of the 5<sup>th</sup> year
program students should be familiar with most neurological
diseases and be competent in the neurological exam.</p>

<p>The sixth year program is principally taking part in the
&quot;Friday tutorials&quot; and also providing a weekly lecture
program that occurs throughout the whole year for both 5<sup>th</sup>
and 6<sup>th</sup> Year students. These are &quot;case
based&quot; tutorials and are provided by the neurologists,
neurosurgeons and paediatric neurologists. There is no other
formal tutorial.</p>

<p>During their &quot;specials&quot; term each group of students
has three 2 hour outpatient teaching sessions reviewing clinical
signs and presentations in common and &quot;classical&quot; but
less common neurological disorders. They also have three
inpatient teaching rounds involving case presentations by the
students and covering common inpatient neurological disorders.
These sessions reinforce principles of neurological examination
and diagnosis as well as some aspects of treatment.</p>

<p>In addition, lectures cover migraine and other headache and
stroke. Students on rotation to Cabrini Hospital receive one or
two tutorial sessions.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="YEAR 2"><font color="#800000" size="6"

<p>The haematology program commences in Year 2 with the following
lectures:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Introduction, Development and Morphology and Structure of
        cellular component of the blood</li>
    <li>Development morphology and structure of cellular
        component of blood including haemopoietic growth factors</li>
    <li>Anaemia - general symptomatology</li>
    <li>Vitamin B12 and folate defisiency</li>
    <li>White blood cells function and disease</li>
    <li>Iron absorption, metabolism, physiological and
        pathological aspects</li>
    <li>Coagulation and platelet disorders</li>
    <li>Serology and blood transfusion</li>
    <li>Thrombosis, including natural anticoagulants</li>
    <li>Measurement in haematology</li>
</ol>

<p>A number of practical classes are also organised in Year 2 and
they include:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Blood film recognition of cell types, differential blood
        counts and example of common clinical problems</li>
    <li>Coagulation - practical aspects</li>
    <li>Seroloqy: the art of cross matching</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p align="center"><a name="YEAR 4"><font color="#800000" size="6"
face="Arial"><b><u>YEAR 4.</u></b></font></a></p>

<p>In Year 4 additional core content in the form of lectures is
delivered in the following topics:</p>

<p>Nutritional anaemia, this expands on the lecture series given
in Year 2 with more sophisticated discussion on the complex
interaction between the various haematinics</p>

<ol>
    <li>Haemolytic anaemia</li>
    <li>Haemorrhagic disorders - the diagnosis and management of
        these problems</li>
    <li>Lymphadenopathy - benign aspects</li>
    <li>A surgical/pathological session involving a patient
        presenting with a lump in the neck</li>
    <li>Thrombosis and thromboembolism - aspects of diagnosis and
        management</li>
    <li>Neutropenia and its consequences</li>
    <li>Haematological disorders in the elderly</li>
    <li>Heparin, anticoagulant and thrombolytic therapy</li>
</ol>

<p>In Year 4 the students will have exposure to three different
haematology laboratory sessions which involve discussion of cases
representing common haematological problems. These sessions
detail laboratory abnormalities including morphological,
coagulation and serological problems. A quiz session is organised
at the end of the laboratory program.</p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><a name="YEAR 5"><font color="#800000" size="6"
face="Arial"><b><u>YEAR 5.</u></b></font></a></p>

<p>In Year 5 additional core lectures are delivered and are in
general site specific although a common theme is discussed, these
include:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Paraproteinaemia</li>
    <li>Myeloproliferative disorders</li>
    <li>Acute leukaemia</li>
    <li>Diagnosis of bleeding disorders</li>
    <li>Complex issues in anaemia</li>
</ol>

<p>Currently we have a handout which incorporates approximately
80% of the core lectures indicated above. I am hopeful that in
1996 the handout given to all students from 2nd Year to 5th Year
will incorporate all the lecture programs in Haematology.</p>

<p>The program is reasonably comprehensive and covers most
aspects of haematology which is relevant to medical students
needs. The Program is very integrated and has been well accepted
by past students. Of particular note are the practical aspects of
the program which discusses important issues that are directly
relevant to clinical practice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please note that the vertical integration of Respiratory
Medicine teaching is still under development. </p>

<p>Our basic science teaching in the Respiratory area is very
much controlled by pre-clinical departments. Over the past couple
of years we have developed quite successfully some integrative
sessions trying to put some important parts of the basic science
program into a clinical perspective.</p>

<p>During the <u>second year</u>, there is a basic course in
clinical skills, but unfortunately no representation by
respiratory physicians. Basic history taking and examination is
taught by a mixture of physiology department staff and members of
the Department of Community Medicine which may lead to
significant problems later on with respect to Respiratory Medical
Training.</p>

<p><u>Ward-based clinical teaching</u> in the fourth, fifth and
six years is divided between the different clinical campuses. At
the Alfred Hospital, we provide clinical teaching in fourth,
fifth and sixth years, and try to guarantee specific teaching in
the areas of history taking and clinical examination skills in
the fifth year, which is now guaranteed to all students coming
through the Alfred. In addition we have two fifth year students
attached to the Respiratory team in four week blocks and they get
a rather more in-depth exposure to the area. As respiratory
teaching is somewhat fragmented, some students will be doing
better than others in terms of having contact with respiratory
specialists. For those students who come through the Alfred our
expectations for the skill base at the strategic time points you
give as follows:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a
name="Expectations for the skill base at strategic time points:"><font
size="5" face="Arial"><b>Expectations for the skill base at
strategic time points:</b></font></a></p>

<p><a name="End of third year:"><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong><u>End
of third year:</u></strong></font></a></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Substantial knowledge of structure and function of the
    respiratory tract with a basic understanding of relevance to
    clinical respiratory disease. In particular, students should
    understand the causes of airflow limitation, understand the
    consequences of interstitial lung inflammation and
    infiltration, and have a reasonable understanding of the
    basis of oxygen therapy.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>They should have a basic ability to take a respiratory
    history and perform a respiratory examination and understand
    the relevance of key features of these processes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="End of the fourth year:"><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong><u>End
of the fourth year:</u></strong></font></a></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>They will have undertaken a systematic course in
    respiratory diseases as a part of the integrated program.
    This is designed to give an overview of the scope of
    respiratory disease without much detail. They should also
    have had exposure to respiratory patients in a ward situation
    and have practiced their clinical skills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="End of the fifth year:"><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong><u>End
of the fifth year</u></strong><strong>:</strong></font></a></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Students should have had a seminar series to add more
    detail to major areas of respiratory disease such as chronic
    obstructive airway disease, asthma, interstitial lung disease
    and have more detailed insights into blood gas analysis,
    oxygen therapy and lung function testing. They should have
    had more detailed clinical teaching in history taking and
    examination of respiratory patients, and have developed
    confidence in clinical management of routine clinical
    respiratory disease in a ward setting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="End of the sixth year:"><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong><u>End

<blockquote>
    <p>Students should have developed a more sophisticated
    overview of respiratory disease, its presentation and
    differential diagnosis.</p>
