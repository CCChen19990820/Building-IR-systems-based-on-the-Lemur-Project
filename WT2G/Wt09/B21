NEWS:<br>
<p>
RED CROSS WORKERS SHOT DEAD IN CHECHNYA. The International Committee of the<br>
Red Cross (ICRC) has suspended operations in Chechnya after unidentified<br>
gunmen shot and killed six aid workers sleeping in an ICRC building in a<br>
village south of the capital, Grozny. The aid workers were foreign nationals<br>
from Norway, Canada, Spain, New Zealand and the Netherlands. The ICRC has<br>
ruled out theft as a motive, saying the workers were deliberately targeted.<br>
Four of those killed were female nurses. (BBC World Service, December 17) A<br>
BBC correspondent says that, if the security situation deteriorates, Moscow<br>
might suspend the withdrawal of troops. This would suit not only the "war<br>
party" in Moscow but also hardliners in Chechnya. (See Perspective item below)<br>
<p>
SOME RUSSIAN MINERS STILL ON STRIKE. Despite a call from the Independent<br>
Miners' Trade Union to halt protest actions as of December 12, some 85,000<br>
miners have reportedly not yet returned to work. The striking miners, many<br>
of them from the Rostov and Tula regions, continue to demand payment of wage<br>
arrears. The Rostov miners continue also to insist on the government's<br>
dismissal. (Interfax, Itar-Tass, December 16)<br>
<p>
SCIENTIST SOUNDS WARNING AS RUSSIA LEADS EUROPE IN ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. A<br>
Russian scientist has told an international conference that alcohol is the<br>
country's main cause of premature death. Dr. Aleksandr Nemtsov said Russia<br>
has the highest alcohol consumption levels in Europe. To make matters worse,<br>
as much as 68 percent of total domestic liquor production is adulterated,<br>
leading to more deaths. Nemtsov called this a threat "not only to public<br>
health but to the nation's gene pool." (Itar-Tass, December 15)<br>
<p>
YELTSIN AUTHORIZES CARRYING OF FIREARMS. Russian president Boris Yeltsin has<br>
reportedly issued a decree allowing citizens to carry guns and knives for<br>
self-defense. Use of the weapons is prohibited against women, minors, and<br>
those showing clear signs of physical or mental disability. (BBC World<br>
Service, December 16)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN DEFENSE CHIEF WARNS OF ARMY'S IMPOVERISHMENT. In an interview with a<br>
Russian daily published yesterday, Defense Minister Igor Rodionov said that<br>
funding shortfalls have left Russia's soldiery impoverished and humiliated.<br>
He warned that many military families were literally starving, and that some<br>
soldiers have been reduced to selling their blood in order to buy<br>
necessities. During a press conference, also yesterday, the commander of<br>
Russia's strategic rocket forces said that the funding shortfalls extended<br>
even to his elite troops. (Reuter, December 16)<br>
<p>
DEEPER CUTS FOR RUSSIA'S ARMY? A Russian news program on December 15 quoted<br>
Defense Council secretary Yuri Baturin as saying that Russia's military<br>
forces could be reduced to 1 million men from what he said was their current<br>
level of 1.5 million. (Novosti, December 15) Public statements on planned<br>
defense cuts to date have generally set the target at 1.2 million soldiers.<br>
But Russia's General Staff Chief, among others, has described even the 1.2<br>
million figure as too low. (Moscow News, October 27-November 3)<br>
<p>
INAUGURATION OF FAR EAST COSMODROME DELAYED AGAIN. The first launch from the<br>
Svobodny launch site in the Far East has been put off from this month until<br>
early next year because the satellite is not ready. Svobodny was once a<br>
strategic missile base housing SS-11 ICBMs. In its new role it will use<br>
"Start-1" boosters based on the SS-25 ICBM. An American company pulled out<br>
of a September launch because of concerns over the reliability of the new<br>
booster. (Itar-Tass, August 30, December 15)<br>
<p>
TURKMENISTAN'S AGRICULTURAL CRISIS MAY SPUR PRIVATIZATION. President<br>
Saparmurad Niazov told a State Council session yesterday that the 1996<br>
harvest was only 480,000 tons of grain and only 450,000 tons of raw cotton,<br>
instead of the planned 1 million tons and 1.4 million tons, respectively.<br>
Niazov called for "immediate solutions" by handing croplands over to the<br>
producers. (UPI, December 16). In a major policy address in September,<br>
Niazov urged leasing former kolkhoz and sovkhoz croplands to private<br>
producers for terms up to 10 years.<br>
<p>
KUCHMA IN SOUTH KOREA. On a four-day official visit to South Korea,<br>
Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma and Ukrainian economic ministers conferred<br>
with President Kim Young-Sam and other South Korean officials on ways to<br>
jump-start bilateral economic ties. The sides signed agreements on the<br>
promotion and protection of investments and direct air links and resolved<br>
both to open diplomatic missions in each other's capitals and to set up a<br>
joint economic cooperation commission. Kuchma is visiting leading South<br>
Korean industrial firms. (Western agencies, Xinhua, December 16-17)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RADUEV AGREES TO RELEASE SOME HOSTAGES. Chechen foreign minister Kazbek<br>
Makhachev, Presidential Aide Akhmed Zakaev, and the secretary of Dagestan's<br>
Security Council, Magomet Tolboev, held talks on December 16 with Chechen<br>
field commander Salman Raduev, who is holding 22 Russian policemen hostage.<br>
Raduev says the policemen are prisoners-of-war, not hostages, and that he<br>
acted to protest against the holding of presidential elections in Chechnya.<br>
Raduev predicts that the elections will not take place since Djohar Dudaev<br>
will reemerge on January 25. (NTV, December 16) After long negotiations,<br>
Raduev agreed to release ten of his hostages today. It remains unclear<br>
whether all or some of the remaining hostages will also be freed. Chechen<br>
prime minister Aslan Maskhadov is insisting on the release of all the<br>
hostages without preconditions. But Raduev has agreed to free only another<br>
ten hostages, and only if he receives an apology from the Russian and<br>
Dagestani governments for restricting his movements and from the Russian<br>
media for "biased coverage." (Interfax, NTV, December 16)<br>
<p>
"I get the impression that Raduev is a little bit loony. He really seems to<br>
think that Dudaev is alive!... It's very hard to negotiate with him,"<br>
Tolboev told the Monitor. In Tolboev's opinion, Raduev's fighters are a<br>
serious military force and even the Chechen authorities are a little afraid<br>
of them. "In Chechnya, kinship ties are very important. In his native<br>
Gudermes, Raduev is Tsar and God and people obey him unconditionally," says<br>
Tolboev, who is returning to Chechnya today for further negotiations with<br>
the rebels. <br>
<p>
Tolboev thinks the Chechen authorities are looking for a way to neutralize<br>
Raduev but dare not risk a military confrontation before the elections.<br>
Chechen leaders suspect Raduev wants to stage a provocation before the<br>
elections, while their hands are tied. They are also nervous lest other,<br>
less well known field commanders follow Raduev's example. Chechen society is<br>
split into spheres of influence under individual field commanders, each<br>
holding sway in his own region. Meanwhile, according to polling data, about<br>
70 percent of the electorate intend to vote for Maskhadov. Yandarbiev is in<br>
second place. (NTV, December 15) Security Council Secretary Ivan Rybkin flew<br>
to Grozny this morning to meet with Chechen authorities and federal troop<br>
commanders to discuss ways of preventing further provocations. (Itar-Tass,<br>
December 17)<br>
<p>
COSSACK PROTESTERS BLOCK TRANSPORT. Some 1,500 Cossacks over the weekend<br>
blocked transport to and from the spa-town of Mineralnye vody in Russia's<br>
Stavropol krai, which borders on Chechnya. The Cossacks, who are demanding<br>
the right to set up armed self-defense units, sealed off the airport,<br>
blocked railway lines, and closed the main road between Rostov and Baku.<br>
They were also protesting the killing of one of their own in Chechnya's<br>
Naursky raion and calling for the release from police custody of another<br>
Cossack, arrested in September on suspicion of smuggling weapons. (Interfax,<br>
ORT, December 15)<br>
<p>
Stavropol's large Cossack community is angry about Chechnya's virtual<br>
independence. They are demanding that two raions, traditionally settled by<br>
Cossacks and now part of Chechnya, be transferred to Stavropol. Naursky and<br>
Shelkovsky raions belonged to Checheno-Ingushetia until World War Two. They<br>
were transferred to Stavropol krai when Stalin deported the Chechens and the<br>
Ingush and liquidated Checheno-Ingushetia in 1944. In 1957, they were<br>
returned to Chechen-Ingushetia. Now the Cossacks want them included in<br>
Russia proper. Some Cossack leaders would like to see the creation of a<br>
distinct Cossack region within Russia that would include not only Naursky<br>
and Shelkovsky raions, but also Dagestan's Kizlyarsky raion, North Ossetia's<br>
Mozdok raion and traditional Cossack settlements in Kabardino-Balkaria.<br>
<p>
RYBKIN MEETS COSSACK REPRESENTATIVES. Security Council Secretary Ivan Rybkin<br>
met in Moscow yesterday with a delegation of the Cossacks protesters. Viktor<br>
Dhevtsov and Aleksandr Korobeinikov, representing the Terek Cossacks, asked<br>
that this group of Cossacks be included in the state register of Cossack<br>
forces and in public order patrols. Rybkin delegated his deputy, Leonid<br>
Maiorov, to work together with the Main Administration of Cossack Forces<br>
under the Russian president to examine their demands. (Interfax, December 16)<br>
<p>
Rybkin also discussed the complaints of Stavropol residents over the fact<br>
that federal troops withdrawn from Chechnya are being stationed in Stavropol<br>
krai without the prior agreement of the regional authorities. Townspeople<br>
are angry because the troops have been billeted in bankrupt local<br>
enterprises. The regional authorities say they do not have enough money to<br>
provide the soldiers and their families with heating, sanitation and<br>
schools. (Interfax, December 16)<br>
<p>
YELTSIN COULD MEET SOON WITH CHINESE LEADER. In yet another indication of<br>
the growing importance attached by Moscow to relations with Beijing, Russian<br>
government sources indicated yesterday that Chinese premier Li Peng could be<br>
the first foreign leader to meet with Boris Yeltsin following the Russian<br>
president's expected return to the Kremlin later this month. The Chinese<br>
leader is scheduled to pay an official visit to Moscow from December 26-28,<br>
and on December 27 will hold talks with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin,<br>
the sources said. A representative of Russia's Foreign Ministry underscored<br>
the significance that Moscow attaches to the visit, reiterating that the<br>
Kremlin "sees in China not only a powerful neighbor, but also a strategic<br>
partner for the 21st century." He also said that the visit is of great<br>
importance in terms of advancing preparations for a Chinese-Russian summit<br>
scheduled for the spring of next year. (Interfax, December 16) <br>
<p>
It is not entirely a coincidence that Russia and China are intensifying high<br>
level bilateral contacts at a time when the West is accelerating its own<br>
efforts to advance integration in Europe through NATO and the European Union<br>
-- steps that have raised tensions with Moscow. A Russian delegation led by<br>
Deputy Prime Minister Aleksei Bolshakov signed a protocol on<br>
military-technical cooperation during a high-profile visit to Beijing that<br>
coincided with the recent NATO meeting in Brussels. Moreover, the run-up to<br>
the 1997 Chinese-Russian summit will likely parallel preparations for a NATO<br>
summit -- scheduled for late in the spring -- at which new members are<br>
expected to begin the process of admission into the alliance. The Kremlin<br>
has long warned that its response to NATO enlargement would include the<br>
construction of closer ties with Asian partners -- including China -- and<br>
undoubtedly sees the upcoming series of talks between Russian and Chinese<br>
leaders in that context. China, which has experienced its own rocky<br>
relations with the West, and especially with the U.S., has made a similar<br>
calculation. And closer ties with Moscow are bringing China's still backward<br>
armed forces a small bonanza of advanced Russian military technology, a<br>
development that has earned Russia's defense industries much needed hard<br>
currency but also raised some concerns in Moscow over the wisdom of arming a<br>
potential rival. (See below)<br>
<p>
MOSCOW COUNTS ON FOREIGN ARMS SALES TO FINANCE DOMESTIC PROGRAMS. Valeri<br>
Mikhaylov, chairman of the Russian government's Defense Industry Department,<br>
said on December 12 that the proceeds from the sale of military equipment to<br>
China would be used to finance "the development of the newest types of<br>
armaments" for Russia's own military. Mikhaylov also suggested that such<br>
foreign sales are critical to the survival of Russia's cash-strapped defense<br>
industrial sector. Although Mikhaylov claimed that there had been no<br>
objections to the recent talks in Beijing on military-technical cooperation<br>
between the two countries, some voices in Russia have urged caution on the<br>
question of arming Beijing. Liu Huaqing, the vice chairman of China's<br>
Central Military Commission, looked to quiet such concerns on December 12<br>
when he said that the Su-27 fighter -- currently being acquired by China<br>
from Russia --i s "not at the cutting edge of development efforts in this<br>
field…." (Itar-Tass, December 12)<br>
<p>
All of the military reform programs broached to date in Russia have<br>
recognized the need to field the most modern arms for the country's<br>
shrinking armed forces. In the short term, at least, this will be very<br>
difficult without foreign revenues from arms sales. The paradox for Russian<br>
planners is that some of this money will probably have to come from<br>
potential enemies. <br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
UKRAINE MIXES CONCILIATION AND FIRMNESS IN SIGNALS TO RUSSIA. In a weekend<br>
broadcast to the nation, Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma stated that<br>
good-neighborly relations with Russia are fundamental to Ukraine's foreign<br>
policy. Kuchma once again extended an invitation to Russian president Boris<br>
Yeltsin to visit Kiev for the long overdue signing of a bilateral political<br>
treaty. Citing Russian-Ukrainian "common history and traditional human<br>
ties," Kuchma stressed that "peace and calm in the whole of Europe depend on<br>
friendly Russian-Ukrainian relations." He also called for completing the<br>
Black Sea Fleet's partition and signing an agreement on the conditions of<br>
the Russian fleet's temporary stationing in Ukraine. The president regretted<br>
the attempts of "certain politicians'" in Moscow to "play the Crimean<br>
card... posing territorial demands, even threatening to use force, and<br>
resorting to uncivilized methods contravening contemporary international<br>
norms... Not everyone in Moscow has learned to treat Ukraine as an<br>
independent state and give up the drill sergeant's tone toward it." Kuchma<br>
called for "calm and civilized negotiations" to settle the Fleet and other<br>
issues. (Interfax-Ukraine, December 15)<br>
<p>
On the same day Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko told a staff meeting of<br>
Ukraine's Diplomatic Academy that the latest tensions in Russian-Ukrainian<br>
relations stem from efforts in Moscow to "restore a Greater Russia [and]<br>
recover the USSR's place in international relations." The end of the war in<br>
Chechnya, he added, "unties Russia's hands to 'make order' in Ukraine."<br>
These tendencies, Udovenko continued, are being exacerbated by President<br>
Boris Yeltsin's illness, which, in practical terms, has triggered an early<br>
campaign for the Russian presidency. Udovenko rejected Russian foreign<br>
minister Yevgeny Primakov's recent assertion that the Helsinki agreements do<br>
not apply to borders among ex-Soviet countries. That thesis, as well as the<br>
Russian government's silence in the face of the Duma's and Federation<br>
Council's claims to Sevastopol "are all the more puzzling as Russia has<br>
guaranteed to respect Ukraine's security and territorial integrity" under<br>
the  agreements on Ukraine's denuclearization. Udovenko nevertheless<br>
maintained that the "difficulties are perfectly soluble," and urged Russian<br>
prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to visit Kiev for talks on the full<br>
spectrum of problems. (Interfax-Ukraine, December 15)<br>
<p>
In a related development, Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov has agreed to the<br>
Ukrainian government's public suggestion that he postpone a planned visit to<br>
Sevastopol for the inauguration of an apartment complex built with Moscow<br>
city funds for Russian Black Sea Fleet personnel. (Russian and Ukrainian<br>
agencies, December 15) A leading promoter of Russian claims to Sevastopol,<br>
Luzhkov on December 7 had also alluded to the possible use of force against<br>
Ukraine -- a statement to which the Russian government failed to react. <br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
NAZARBAEV STRESSES REFORMS AND NATIONAL INTEREST ON INDEPENDENCE<br>
ANNIVERSARY. Kazakhstan yesterday marked the fifth anniversary of its<br>
independence and the tenth anniversary of mass protests in Almaty against<br>
Moscow rule. Addressing the country, President Nursultan Nazarbaev stated<br>
that the December 16, 1986 demonstrations paved the way for the December 16,<br>
1991 proclamation of independence. Nazarbaev named interethnic tranquillity,<br>
market reforms, and integration into the world economy as Kazakhstan's main<br>
achievements since independence and said that they must remain the country's<br>
main objectives -- "from which we must not deviate" -- in the years ahead.<br>
Kazakhstan's attitude toward Russia and the CIS is determined by "the<br>
national interests of the independent state... The age of forcible<br>
integration lives only in the inflamed imagination of empire-gatherers."<br>
Nazarbaev said, alluding to the Russian emperors' title as "land-gatherers."<br>
A large monument to Kazakhstan's independence, representing an ancestral<br>
Turkic warrior, was unveiled yesterday in central Almaty in the presence of<br>
Turkish president Suleyman Demirel. (Interfax, Western agencies, December 16)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN OFFICERS INCREASINGLY AT RISK IN TAJIKISTAN. Even as the Tajik<br>
ceasefire agreement was being signed, Col. Viktor Chesnokov of Tajikistan's<br>
Defense Ministry died of wounds sustained while commanding Tajik government<br>
troops in Tavildara. Maj. Gen. Aleksandr Chubarov, deputy defense minister<br>
of Tajikistan, praised Chesnokov for "faithfully serving the motherland."<br>
(Itar-Tass, Interfax, December 12) Chubarov personally commands the Tajik<br>
government forces in the Pamir foothills, the main theater of hostilities.<br>
The deputy minister of internal affairs of Tajikistan, Maj. Gen. Gennady<br>
Blinov, oversees the special troops operating there. The government's<br>
reverses in the most recent phase of the fighting have increased the<br>
exposure of the Tajik forces' Russian commanders. <br>
<p>
Moscow's recent decision to create a Russian military advisory staff in<br>
Dushanbe will nevertheless further increase the oversight role of Russian<br>
officers in the operational command of Tajik government forces. Dushanbe,<br>
moreover, had offered additional postings in its forces to Russian officers<br>
through advertisements in the Russian military press.<br>

<p>
ASYLUM SEEKERS RETURNED TO RUSSIA. Eight Russians who had applied for asylum<br>
in Norway approximately one month ago have been refused by Oslo and deported<br>
back to Russia, a Norwegian newspaper reported on December 13. Russian<br>
diplomatic sources indicated, however, that Norwegian authorities had<br>
informed them neither of the refusal nor of the fact that the eight were<br>
back in Russia. Despite complaints from Moscow, Oslo has from the beginning<br>
refused to provide any information on the identities or the motives of the<br>
asylum seekers. (Itar-Tass, December 14. See Monitor, November 13)<br>
<p>
MOSCOW PRAISES UN SECRETARY GENERAL DESIGNATE. A Russian deputy foreign<br>
minister on December 14 welcomed the selection by the UN Security Council of<br>
Kofi Annan of Ghana as the organization's next secretary general. Moscow had<br>
been a strong supporter of current secretary general Boutros Boutros-Ghali,<br>
whose bid for reelection was opposed by the U.S. Annan is expected to be<br>
elected formally to the post by the UN General Assembly tomorrow. (Interfax,<br>
December 14)<br>
<p>
ISRAEL INDICTS ALLEGED RUSSIAN SPY. Israeli authorities have indicted a<br>
Russian-born electrical engineer on charges of spying for Moscow, Israeli TV<br>
said on December 11. Anatoly Gendler has been accused of passing to Moscow<br>
sensitive information on Israeli air force bases and other military<br>
facilities. Israeli security officials say that Gendler was trained by the<br>
KGB in former Soviet Moldavia and that he has caused serious damage to<br>
Israel's security. Gendler immigrated to Israel in 1981. (AP, December 11)<br>
<p>
REPRIEVE FOR AIRBORNE DIVISIONS. Russia's Airborne Forces will be pared down<br>
to 48,500 troops by the end of the year as previously announced, but all<br>
five divisions will be retained. Defense Minister Igor Rodionov's original<br>
reduction directive called for the elimination of two of the divisions. A<br>
spokesman for the airborne troops staff described the change as a concession<br>
to the leadership of the paratroopers. (Interfax, December 15)<br>
<p>
KUCHMA CRITICIZES UKRAINIAN ARMED FORCES. Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma<br>
criticized the leadership of the Defense Ministry on December 13 for what he<br>
said were severe problems in the armed forces. Kuchma demanded to know why<br>
not a single one of the 181 battalions in the Ground Forces were combat<br>
ready and called for an investigation into the commercial use of military<br>
aircraft. The president also complained about what he said was a breakdown<br>
of discipline in the military. (Interfax-Ukraine, December 14) <br>

RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN DUMA APPROVES 1997 DRAFT BUDGET. Russia's Communist-dominated Duma<br>
approved the first reading of the draft 1997 federal budget yesterday.<br>
(Interfax, December 15) This was the third time parliament had debated the<br>
budget in as many months, and adoption is a significant victory for the<br>
government. It increases the chances that the budget will be definitively<br>
approved, as the law requires, by the end of the year. Second and third<br>
readings are scheduled for December 25 -- the day President Boris Yeltsin<br>
says he hopes to return to work in the Kremlin. <br>
<p>
Revenues in the draft budget are set at 434.36 trillion rubles and<br>
expenditures at 529.76, leaving a deficit equivalent to 3.5 percent of<br>
Russian GDP. The budget envisages a two percent increase in GDP, which would<br>
make 1997 the first year of positive growth in Russia since it began the<br>
transition to a market economy. Both revenues and expenditures have been<br>
increased by 35 trillion rubles over the final amounts that had been<br>
approved earlier by Russia's government-parliament conciliatory commission.<br>
The augmentation of planned revenues makes possible an increase in resources<br>
allocated to the Russian regions and to the agrarian and coal sectors,<br>
traditional recipients of state support. Russian prime minister Viktor<br>
Chernomyrdin pointed in particular to additional planned allocations of 5<br>
trillion rubles for the agrarian sector and one trillion rubles for housing<br>
construction (Interfax, December 15) <br>
<p>
But the chairman of the Duma's Budget Committee, Yabloko's Mikhail Zadornov,<br>
expressed some reservations about the viability of the budget. According to<br>
Zadornov, the document fails to account for more than 70 trillion rubles of<br>
revenue, which means that only 75-80 percent of the planned expenditures can<br>
be financed. (Interfax, December 14) Indeed, given the increase in fiscal<br>
receipts envisaged in the 1997 budget and the difficulties observed in<br>
collecting taxes in the past, it appears that practical budget developments<br>
will be determined by the government's ability to raise revenue. With this<br>
in mind, the budget's projected revenues of 11 trillion rubles in payments<br>
from tax arrears of past years -- up from nine trillion originally envisaged<br>
-- seems overly optimistic. (Segodnya, December 15)<br>
<p>
Agrarians, Communists, and Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats voted<br>
for the budget, Yabloko against. The vote totals were 262 in favor, 122<br>
against, and seven abstentions. (Interfax, December 15) Responding to<br>
Communist demands, Chernomyrdin repeated his earlier promise to pay wage and<br>
pension arrears by the end of this year to all except the army, which will<br>
be paid in January. Communist parliamentarians had also called for the<br>
dismissal of presidential chief-of-staff Anatoly Chubais as the price for<br>
passing the budget, but Chernomyrdin warned them not to confuse politics<br>
with economics and ignored their demand.<br>
<p>
IMF HAS GOOD NEWS FOR RUSSIA. In another welcome economic development for<br>
the Russian government, the IMF decided on December 13 to disburse the $336<br>
million October tranche of its extended loan to Russia. The IMF said the<br>
decision was taken because Russia had improved its tax collection<br>
procedures. The Fund did not however say when or whether the November and<br>
December tranches would be paid. An IMF delegation has arrived in Moscow to<br>
monitor the fulfillment of the program in November and the first half of<br>
December. (Interfax, December 14)<br>
<p>
RADUEV RETURNS TO HOSTAGE-TAKING; CHECHEN OFFICIALS CALL IT "PROVOCATION."<br>
The commander of Russian Interior Ministry troops in Chechnya warned the<br>
Chechen leadership in a strongly worded memorandum on December 15 that the<br>
seizure of 22 Russian policemen on the Chechen-Dagestani border could slow<br>
the withdrawal of federal forces from the republic. (Interfax, December 15)<br>
The 22 men, members of the Penza OMON, were seized December 14 on the border<br>
between Chechnya and Dagestan by Chechen field commander Salman Raduev,<br>
famous for his hostage-taking raid on the Dagestani city of Kizlyar last<br>
January. Raduev said he was protesting the illegality of the presidential<br>
elections to be held in Chechnya on January 27. He said Chechnya already has<br>
a president -- Djokar Dudaev -- and that Dudaev is alive. The same day,<br>
Raduyev's fighters seized a UN official and his interpreter, but freed them<br>
in a few hours. (NTV, December 15)<br>
<p>
Chechen prime minister Aslan Maskhadov instructed his staff to resolve the<br>
matter, and Interior Minister Kazbek Makhachev went to Gudermes to negotiate<br>
with Raduev. Speaking live on NTV, Chechen deputy premier Movladi Udugov<br>
called the incident a deliberate provocation, intended to disrupt the<br>
withdrawal of Russian troops from the republic. Udugov expressed the hope<br>
that the border guards would be freed as early as December 16. Udugov<br>
dismissed Raduev's claim that Dudaev was still alive. (NTV, December 15)<br>
<p>
HOSTAGE-TAKING REVEALS SPLIT BETWEEN CHECHEN LEADERS. The fact that such an<br>
incident could take place on the eve of the elections is confirmation of a<br>
split in the once-united Chechen resistance forces. When he was still<br>
Security Council secretary, Aleksandr Lebed asserted that only 30 percent of<br>
the Chechen resistance fighters were completely loyal to Maskhadov, another<br>
30 percent were partially loyal to him, and the rest obeyed only their own<br>
field commanders. Lebed included Raduev among those who were "partially loyal."<br>
<p>
During the war, Chechnya was divided into zones of influence of individual<br>
field commanders, each reliant on people from his own region. This system<br>
remains in force today. Raduev holds sway in Gudermes raion, Shamil Basaev<br>
in Vedeno raion. This "feudalization" of Chechnya could lead to a situation<br>
in which, even after democratic elections, pockets of Chechen society will<br>
not accept their results and regions could emerge that will not obey any<br>
elected leadership. Leaders like Raduev could try to gain de facto<br>
independence for the regions under their control. In the worst case, this<br>
could lead to what skeptics have been predicting all along -- armed<br>
confrontation in Chechnya. (Nezavisimaya gazeta, December 16)<br>
<p>
MOSCOW PROTESTS OPENING OF CHECHEN INFORMATION CENTER IN WARSAW. A Chechen<br>
Information Center opened in Warsaw last week. Representatives of the<br>
present Chechen authorities, including First Deputy Premier Khozhakhmet<br>
Nukhaev and Minister for Foreign Affairs Ruslan Chimaev attended the<br>
opening. Alla Dudaeva, the widow of the former Chechen president, was guest<br>
of honor. (NTV, Izvestiya, December 15)<br>
<p>
The first Chechen Information Center opened eighteen months ago in Poland's<br>
third largest city, Krakow. The leaders of the Chechen resistance<br>
communicated regularly with the information center, which became their main<br>
representation abroad. When Moscow protested about the existence of what it<br>
said was a virtual embassy of Chechnya-Ichkeria in Poland, the Polish<br>
government replied that the decision to open the center was made by the<br>
Krakow authorities, and that Warsaw maintained no contacts with it. <br>
<p>
According to Chechen sources, similar information centers now exist in 22<br>
countries, including Azerbaijan, Turkey, Ukraine, the Baltic states,<br>
Pakistan, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, France and England. Moscow has threatened to<br>
break off diplomatic relations with any country that gives diplomatic<br>
recognition to Chechnya-Ichkeria and Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs<br>
has already protested the opening of the Warsaw office; the Polish<br>
government has again denied any involvement. The Chechen leadership argues<br>
that the information centers do not constitute political representation.<br>
According to Chechen foreign minister Ruslan Chimaev, "The world is ready to<br>
recognize us, but is afraid of Russia." (Izvestiya, December 15)<br>
<p>
ENVIRONMENTALIST CHARGED WITH TREASON IS SET FREE. Former Soviet naval<br>
captain Alexander Nikitin was released from prison on December 14 after<br>
spending some 10 months behind bars. He had co-authored a report on problems<br>
with nuclear waste in the Russian Northern Fleet published by the Bellona<br>
Foundation, a Norwegian environmental group. Nikitin was arrested on<br>
February 6 by Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), and was first held as<br>
a witness in a case the FSB was building against Bellona. Then, in October,<br>
he was charged with high treason under Article 64 of the Soviet-era criminal<br>
code for allegedly providing classified information on submarine activities. <br>
<p>
Nikitin's lawyer, Yuri Shmidt, said the charges against his client -- which<br>
could carry the death penalty -- had not been dropped, but expressed<br>
confidence they would be. "This is the first time," Shmidt said, " that<br>
anyone charged under Article 64 has gone free." Shmidt credited Prosecutor<br>
General Yuri Skurltov with ordering Nikitin's release. Nikitin's<br>
incarceration had soured Russian relations with Norway and had prompted<br>
protests from human rights and environmental organizations around the world.<br>
The European Parliament had also asked the Russian government to investigate<br>
the matter. (Interfax, December 14-15; Boston Globe, December 15)<br>

THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN "PIRACY" INCIDENT IN BLACK SEA ALMOST RESOLVED. Russian authorities<br>
on December 14 released the Ukrainian cargo ship Almaz and its 10 crewmen,<br>
seized in Georgia's port of Batumi and held incommunicado since December 4.<br>
(See Monitor, December 13) The captain of the vessel is still being held.<br>
Russia's Foreign Ministry yesterday provided "explanations" of the incident,<br>
as demanded by Georgia in a vehement protest note. Russian first deputy<br>
foreign minister Boris Pastukhov publicly conceded yesterday that Russian<br>
border troops had "violated certain norms" and urged that "the incident be<br>
laid to rest... without affecting Russian-Georgian relations." Duma chairman<br>
Gennady Seleznev, conceding a "misunderstanding" on Russia's part, called<br>
the failure to notify Ukraine and Georgia "unpardonable." The Russian border<br>
troops' Moscow command announced that it has "no claims" on the Almaz; and<br>
Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) stated that it consented to release<br>
the crew "due to the good neighborly relations which exist between Russia<br>
and Ukraine." The Almaz, with its load of Georgian citrus fruit, was allowed<br>
to leave Batumi for Ukraine.<br>
<p>
It was learned over the weekend that warships of Russia's border troops had<br>
seized the Almaz at the behest of Russia's FSB, which wanted to arrest the<br>
crew and impound the ship for having smuggled food and alcoholic beverages<br>
from Bulgaria to Russia last August. The 11 Ukrainian sailors were flown to<br>
Novorossiisk and held under arrest by local FSB authorities. Russia's border<br>
troops alleged that the agreement on "jointly guarding the sections of<br>
Georgia's borders which coincide with the CIS outer borders" authorized them<br>
to seize a third country's ship and crew on Georgian territory. Senior<br>
Georgian officials, however, rejected that claim and publicly branded the<br>
seizure as "blatant piracy" on December 12. Kiev for its part reacted<br>
timidly, concerned above all -- as foreign minister Hennady Udovenko and<br>
Security and Defense Council head Volodymyr Horbulin stated -- to avoid<br>
exacerbating Russian-Ukrainian tensions in the Black Sea. These officials<br>
admitted to the August smuggling run of the Almaz and chose not to challenge<br>
the Russian seizure. It  was left to Georgia's Foreign Ministry to demand<br>
the immediate return of the Ukrainian ship and crew to Ukraine. (Interfax,<br>
Itar-Tass, NTV, December 13-15)<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
AZERBAIJAN'S FOURTH BIG OIL CONTRACT SIGNED. Azerbaijan and the members of<br>
an international consortium signed on December 14 in Baku a contract to<br>
develop the Ashrafi and Dan Uluzu oil fields on Azerbaijan's Caspian shelf.<br>
The consortium consists of the U.S. company Amoco with a 30 percent stake as<br>
project operator; an alliance of the California-based UNOCAL with 25.5<br>
percent and Saudi Arabia's Delta with 4.5 percent; and Japan's Itohu and<br>
Azerbaijan's State Oil Company with 20 percent each. The foreign partners<br>
are financing Azerbaijan's stake. Worth $2 billion over a 25-year period,<br>
the project is due to yield the first commercial output in the year 2003 and<br>
to produce 7 million tons of crude oil annually beginning in 2007. The<br>
estimated reserves of the two fields are 150 million tons of oil and 50<br>
billion cubic meters of natural gas. The contract area covers some 450<br>
square kilometers, at depths ranging from 75 to 200 meters, situated<br>
approximately 35 nautical miles off Azerbaijan's Apsheron peninsula. <br>
<p>
The contract, which is Azerbaijan's fourth with international consortiums,<br>
increases the value of international investment commitments in Azerbaijan's<br>
oil and gas projects to nearly $13 billion. This latest contract is also the<br>
first without any Russian participation. LUKoil has minor stakes in<br>
Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli and Shah Deniz and a major stake in the "Karabakh"<br>
project.<br>
<p>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, President Haidar Aliev obliquely accused<br>
Russia -- referred to as "foreign forces" -- of "seeking to jeopardize<br>
Azerbaijan's international oil contracts" by claiming that they contravene<br>
the Caspian Sea's legal status. Aliev stated that such objections are<br>
irrelevant and that Azerbaijan will not change its policy, which has the<br>
"full support of the USA.". Amoco chairman Don Stacy stated at the same<br>
ceremony that Amoco hopes to sign another major contract for offshore fields<br>
in the southern part of Azerbaijan's sector. (Western agencies, Petroleum<br>
Information Agency, Turan, December 14)<br>

CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
TAJIKISTAN CEASEFIRE MAY BE TAKING HOLD, BUT DUSHANBE'S TROUBLES MULTIPLY.<br>
The Tajik government claimed yesterday that the ceasefire signed with the<br>
opposition on December 11 (see Monitor, December 12) was finally taking<br>
hold. On December 12-14 the opposition had continued attacking government<br>
units still trapped in Garm and Labijar. It had also captured government<br>
armor near Komsomolabad, and in a bold  foray outside Tavildara, had seized<br>
gold fields just abandoned by the government and a British company in<br>
Hovaling district. Russia's visiting Defense Council chief Yuri Baturin and<br>
the Tajik government implied in public statements that they were prepared to<br>
overlook the opposition's alleged violations of the ceasefire in order to<br>
avoid jeopardizing the meeting between Tajik president Imomali Rahmonov and<br>
opposition chairman Saidabdullo Nuri, scheduled for December 19 in Moscow.<br>
<p>
The government was also challenged from three directions by disgruntled<br>
former allies. Popular Front fighters from Kurgan-Tube in the south, who<br>
originally helped Rahmonov to power, held a rally to demand the release of a<br>
field commander arrested by Dushanbe. Warlord Ibod Boimatov, who controls<br>
the Uzbek-inhabited Tursunzade area in the west, turned down government<br>
overtures and was officially declared a criminal by Rahmonov over the<br>
weekend. Former prime minister Abdumalik Abdulajonov, chairman of the<br>
National Revival bloc that speaks for Leninabad region in the north --<br>
Tajikistan's most developed and populous, and sulking under the rule of<br>
Rahmonov's Kulob clan -- warned that it will not recognize agreements<br>
reached at the December 19 Moscow meeting unless Moscow and Dushanbe rescind<br>
their refusal to admit the bloc as a third party to the talks. The<br>
opposition has supported the bloc's position. (Interfax, Itar-Tass, Voice of<br>
Free Tajikistan, Western agencies, December 12-15)<br>
<p>
United Tajik Opposition first vice chairman Akbar Turajonzoda over the<br>
weekend virtually disavowed the ceasefire agreement's provisions that<br>
require the opposition to withdraw from areas seized since September.<br>
Turanjozoda obliquely criticized Nuri for consenting to those provisions in<br>
his agreement with Rahmonov. (Interviews to Radio Liberty, December 12, and<br>
Nezavisimaya gazeta, December 15)<br>
<p>
Moscow and Dushanbe seem to have put all of their eggs in the basket of the<br>
December 19 Moscow meeting, at which they hope to induce Nuri into<br>
concessions. The Iranian government has declared its support of a<br>
Russian-mediated solution at that meeting.<br>

YANDARBIEV HOSPITALIZED AFTER CAR CRASH. Chechnya's president Zelimkhan<br>
Yandarbiev was hospitalized yesterday in Grozny after breaking his arm and<br>
injuring his collarbone in a road accident. Yandarbiev was not seriously<br>
injured and said there was no reason to suspect foul play. (NTV, December<br>
12) Today Yandarbiev is reported to be feeling better, and is expected to<br>
leave the hospital soon and to resume his presidential campaign. (Itar-Tass,<br>

MUSLIM UNION PLANS TO SET UP FACTION IN RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT. The Union of<br>
Muslims of Russia (UMR) hopes to establish a Muslim faction in the Russian<br>
Duma. At present, most of the 26 Muslim members of the Russian parliament<br>
belong to the pro-government "Russia is Our Home" faction. Formation of a<br>
Muslim faction will be spearheaded by UMR chairman Nadirshakh Khachilaev,<br>
elected to the Duma last weekend to represent Makhachkala, capital of<br>
Dagestan. (Interfax, December 12)<br>
<p>
LEBED TO FOUND NEW PARTY. Sources close to Aleksandr Lebed say he will<br>
announce plans to found a political party at a conference of supporters on<br>
December 26. They also expect Lebed to announce that he will run for<br>
election as Governor of Tula oblast. (Interfax, December 12) Meanwhile,<br>
Thomas Pickering, until recently U.S. ambassador in Moscow, has predicted<br>
that Russian voters will soon tire of the former general and will not<br>
support him as a presidential candidate in 2000. Pickering says Lebed is in<br>
danger of becoming "another Zhirinovsky" -- "a nationalist icon with no<br>
shelf life." (UPI, December 11)<br>

OVER A THOUSAND RUSSIAN SERVICEMEN MISSING SINCE START OF WAR. Russian<br>
military authorities say 1,198 servicemen have gone missing in Chechnya<br>
since the Russian military intervention began on December 12, 1994. (Radio<br>
Russia, December 11)<br>
<p>
DUMA LEADER CALLS FOR MEASURES AGAINST PROSPECTIVE NATO MEMBERS. The<br>
chairman of the Russian Duma's Security Committee said on December 11 that<br>
Moscow should consider retargeting its nuclear missiles on Eastern European<br>
and former Soviet states desirous of joining NATO if the alliance proceeds<br>
with plans to accept new members. Viktor Ilyukhin, of the Communist party,<br>
suggested that Russia should also consider unspecified political and<br>
economic moves against those states. (Itar-Tass, December 11)<br>
<p>
UKRAINE TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGATION ON LIBYA ARMS DEAL. The Ukrainian<br>
parliament yesterday resolved to create a special commission to investigate<br>
a U.S. newspaper's allegation of Ukrainian arms dealings with Libya. (See<br>
Monitor, December 10-11) The Communist party's parliamentary group initiated<br>
the move hoping to embarrass the government. The majority at first rejected<br>
it, but reversed itself after the military intelligence chief, Gen.<br>
Aleksandr Skypalsky, told the chamber that an investigation would be useful<br>
for "removing the unfounded accusations against Ukraine." (Interfax-Ukraine,<br>
December 12)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN "PIRACY" IN BLACK SEA DENOUNCED. Ukraine's consul in Georgia<br>
yesterday denounced as "piracy" the seizure of a Ukrainian cargo ship by<br>
Russian warships attached to the Russian border troops in Georgia's port of<br>
Batumi. The Russians seized the "Almaz" on December 4, detained the captain,<br>
and flew the other 10 crewmen to Russia on December 11, all without<br>
explanation, the consul stated. Kiev has protested to Moscow, and Georgia's<br>
Foreign Ministry announced yesterday that it is investigating the case.<br>
(Interfax, December 12. See also Georgia in Perspective section below)<br>

LUKASHESKU PERSONALITY CULT EMERGING IN BELARUS. Hard on the heels of<br>
president Aleksandr Lukashenko's assumption of absolute powers, the state<br>
has launched a special-issue postage stamp bearing Lukashenko's portrait.<br>
One Lukashenko costs 2,500 Belarus rubles, which amounts to not quite 11 US<br>
cents. (Belapan, December 10). Minsk wags now refer to the president as<br>
Lukashesku, by analogy to the late Romanian dictator Ceaushescu.<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
RADICAL MILITARY REFORM ON THE TABLE IN RUSSIA? Speculation is rife in<br>
Moscow that Russia's political and military leaderships are discussing plans<br>
that would radically restructure and reduce the country's entire military<br>
establishment. According to the newspaper Izvestiya, a reform program<br>
drafted by officers from Russia's General Staff outlines a two-stage period<br>
of reform. During the first stage, from 1997-2000, the regular armed forces<br>
would be reduced to 1.2 million men (their nominal strength is currently 1.7<br>
million) while military formations attached to other state agencies (the<br>
so-called "power structures") would be cut by 30 percent. The newspaper says<br>
that during the second stage, from 2001-2005, the total manpower strength of<br>
the armed forces would be 1.7 million. This figure presumably refers to the<br>
combined strength of the regular army plus the other power structures<br>
(believed now to be well in excess of three million troops), although the<br>
report does not make this clear. During this second stage Russia's military<br>
forces would be manned solely by contract (which would fulfill Boris<br>
Yeltsin's election campaign promise to end conscription), and some 500<br>
generals would be retired. <br>
<p>
The plan reportedly also calls for a redrawing of military district<br>
boundaries and an amalgamation of various military service branches and<br>
structures. The Air Defense and Air Force would be combined, for example,<br>
while the commands of Russia's strategic forces and Ground Forces would be<br>
transferred to the General Staff -- which emerges in this plan as Russia's<br>
dominant military agency. Of equal or greater importance, the plan's authors<br>
reportedly cite the need to reduce military spending as the primary reason<br>
for implementing such radical changes. They acknowledge, moreover, that<br>
Russia today is capable of waging no more than a localized military<br>
operation and suggest that, because of the weakness of Russia's conventional<br>
forces, Moscow should make clear its readiness to employ nuclear weapons to<br>
prevent any large-scale war that would involve Russia and -- in the<br>
newspaper's words -- "its allies." (Izvestiya, December 11)<br>
<p>
Although it is unclear whether the program outlined by Izvestiya is among<br>
those being considered by Russia's political and military leaders, it is<br>
consistent on several key points with military reform proposals described in<br>
recent days and weeks by, among others, Defense Council secretary Yuri<br>
Baturin. (RTR, December 11) These common elements include especially the<br>
enhancement of the General Staff's authority within the armed forces, and<br>
the extension of its oversight responsibilities to Russia's other power<br>
structures. Political leaders, moreover, have appeared in recent weeks to be<br>
increasingly receptive to the Defense Ministry's demand that the other power<br>
structures undergo manpower reductions similar to those being imposed on the<br>
army. All of this suggests that radical military reform may at last be on<br>
the table -- nearly ten years after Soviet defense reformers first began<br>
pleading its desirability. What is less clear is whether the political<br>
leadership has the political will and authority to carry it out, given the<br>
heated opposition that restructuring and reductions of this sort are sure to<br>
provoke from the well-entrenched and independent bureaucratic interests that<br>
currently comprise Russia's defense and security establishment. <br>

NEW PRIME MINISTER NAMED IN INGUSHETIA. President Ruslan Aushev of the north<br>
Caucasus Republic of Ingushetia has named Belan Khamchiev as Ingushetia's<br>
new prime minister and instructed him to form a new government. (Itar-Tass,<br>
December 10) Aushev shocked both Moscow and Nazran on December 9 when he<br>
sacked almost the entire government, accusing it of being economically<br>
inefficient and, possibly, corrupt. This was the second change of government<br>
in Ingushetia within a year. Only the "power" ministers kept their posts. <br>
<p>
The 36-year-old Khamchiev is being parachuted in from outside the<br>
government; since 1993 he has been in Moscow as Aushev's representative to<br>
the Russian president. His appointment is nonetheless being seen in Moscow<br>
as a possibly alarming gesture of defiance. Kommersant-daily says that there<br>
are two (not inconsistent) explanations for the change. The first is that<br>
Russia's military defeat in neighboring Chechnya has brought new and much<br>
tougher-minded leaders to power in Grozny. Chechnya, Kommersant-daily<br>
remarks, tends to look on Ingushetia "as Russia looks on Belarus," that is,<br>
as a little brother. Aushev has therefore responded to Chechnya's tougher<br>
line, the newspaper suggests, by sacking his former prime minister,<br>
Mukharbek Didigov, "who has always been considered as a person with a<br>
pronounced pro-Moscow orientation." <br>
<p>
The second explanation for the change of prime ministers is that Aushev is<br>
dissatisfied with the meager results to date of Ingushetia's free economic<br>
zone (FEZ) -- established two years ago--and wants a government that will<br>
pursue economic profit in a more hard-headed manner. Indeed, during a recent<br>
conversation with the Monitor Aushev observed that 90 percent of the<br>
republic's budget still comes from economic subsidies. And unemployment<br>
remains unacceptably high, at 53 percent of the employable population. (See<br>
Monitor, November 22) Contrary to the hopes of those who introduced it, the<br>
FEZ has proven unable to solve the problem of settling the thousands of<br>
Ingush refugees who fled from North Ossetia in 1992, the majority of whom<br>
have not yet returned. These refugees still live in railroad cars and in<br>
their camps the Monitor's correspondent met 13-year-olds who were unable to<br>
read or write. <br>
<p>
COAL MINERS' STRIKE COMES TO A CLOSE. Following a decision taken on December<br>
11, the Independent Miners' Trade Union yesterday ended the strike that the<br>
coal miners had launched on December 3. Support for the strike had been<br>
dwindling in recent days. In Rostov, however, the regional miners committee<br>
said it intended to continue the protest action. (Itar-Tass, December 12) <br>
<p>
In general, workers' representatives seem to be satisfied with promises by<br>
the government to pay wage arrears and provide state support to the<br>
industry. On December 10, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told Russia' s<br>
Federation Council that the coal industry will receive a total of 10<br>
trillion rubles this year, of which 7.6 trillion rubles have already been<br>
transferred. He also reported that 650 billion rubles will be allocated in<br>
December for the payment of wage debts in the coal industry. Chernomyrdin<br>
said that comprehensive solutions to problems in the coal mining sector are<br>
required, including additional restructuring and the transfer of social<br>
facilities run by the coal enterprises to local authorities. (Itar-Tass,<br>
December 10)<br>
<p>
According to a representative of Rosugol, however, the total wage debt in<br>
the coal sector amounted to 2.6 trillion rubles on December 1, and the<br>
payment of state debts to the sector will not, therefore, solve the<br>
industry's problems. (Interfax, December 12) Like Chernomyrdin, the official<br>
highlighted the non-payment by power companies for coal deliveries as the<br>
main cause of the industry's dire financial situation. <br>
<p>
Plans for restructuring the sector have been established within the<br>
framework of a World Bank-sponsored program, and a decision on the granting<br>
of a further $250 million credit is expected in the coming weeks. The World<br>
Bank's representative in Moscow called on December 10 for a reduction of<br>
state support for the coal sector and changes in the structure of subsidies<br>
in favor of measures to increase social protections and to encourage<br>
competition. (Interfax, December 10) <br>
<p>
SHARES OF THE SIDANKO OIL COMPANY ARE UP FOR SALE. The International<br>
Financial Company (IFC), a Russian bank, has decided to sell shares in the<br>
oil company Sidanko for a total value of 51 percent of the enterprise's<br>
capital. The bank received these shares at the end of last year, as a<br>
guarantee for the payment of a loan made to the state. All the banks that<br>
obtained shares in state companies -- as a deposit within the framework of<br>
this loans-for-shares scheme -- were allowed to start selling those shares<br>
beginning on September 1 1996. When sales of shares take place, proceedings<br>
accrue to the federal budget, minus the value of the loan given by the bank<br>
to the state and commissions for the management of the operation. If the<br>
money raised by the sale of the shares is less than the amount borrowed by<br>
the state, no compensation payments are made to the lender bank. <br>
<p>
The starting price of the package of Sidanko shares being offered is $129<br>
million, just $1 million short of the value of the loan granted by the IFC.<br>
Purchase applications have to be made by January 9, and the results of these<br>
applications will be known by January 11. The oil company Sidanko includes a<br>
number of filial enterprises that deal with the extraction, refining, and<br>
marketing of oil. Last year, a total of 22.8 million tons of oil were<br>
extracted by the group, which makes it the fourth largest Russian oil<br>
company. But Sidanko has faced financial problems, and last week the Federal<br>
Department on Bankruptcy urged it to pay its debts, which amount to 1.5<br>
trillion rubles, or face bankruptcy proceedings (Interfax, December 10-11)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
BELARUSAN RUMP PARLIAMENT IN SESSION. Some 45 deputies from the forcibly<br>
dissolved Belarusan parliament, including a majority of its presidium's<br>
members and of its commissions' chairmen, held a session at the Minsk<br>
Literary House on December 10-12. The deputies resolved to hold regular<br>
meetings at least once a month. They also empowered the presidium to<br>
continue working as a permanent body and set up two standing commissions to<br>
handle organization and information. <br>
<p>
In an appeal to domestic and international public opinion, the deputies<br>
reaffirmed their refusal to recognize the recent, rigged constitutional<br>
referendum and announced that they will ensure the continuity of the<br>
legitimate parliament. They also called on foreign parliaments and<br>
international organizations not to recognize as legitimate the organs of<br>
state power created under the new presidential constitution. Only the<br>
legitimate parliament is entitled to represent Belarus in the Parliamentary<br>
Assemblies of the Council of Europe (PACE) and of the OSCE and in other<br>
interparliamentary bodies, the appeal stated. The PACE informed Minsk<br>
yesterday that its upcoming plenary session will consider depriving the new<br>
Belarusan parliament of the guest status that had been granted to the<br>
now-dissolved parliament. <br>
<p>
The rump parliament is not quite as toothless as it may seem. Demonstrations<br>
for democracy and independence were held on December 8 and 10 in Minsk. The<br>
authorities arrested dozens of participants, imposing heavy fines on some<br>
and instituting civil proceedings against others. (Belapan, Interfax,<br>
December 10-12)<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
KARABAKH REBUFFS OSCE. Karabakh's Foreign Ministry and National Assembly<br>
have warned in almost identical statements that they "question the<br>
advisability of Karabakh's further participation in the [OSCE-sponsored]<br>
negotiating process" to settle the conflict with Azerbaijan. Deploring the<br>
recent OSCE summit's acceptance of Azerbaijan's position, the Karabakh<br>
statements rejected OSCE chairman-in-office Flavio Cotti's concluding<br>
document on conflict settlement principles as "one-sided, contravening the<br>
essence of international mediation," "totally ignoring the<br>
international-legal and historic aspects of the problem, and offending<br>
against justice and common sense." The OSCE is ignoring the right of peoples<br>
to self-determination, the Karabakh statements charged, and added that<br>
Karabakh has won that right at high cost and will never give up its security<br>
by becoming again a part of Azerbaijan. (Interfax, December 11-12)<br>
<p>
The statements represent an internationally unprecedented rebuff to the<br>
OSCE's authority. The organization's biannual summit, held in Lisbon last<br>
week, cemented the consensus in favor of the territorial integrity of states<br>
at the expense of the right of peoples to self-determination. Armenia found<br>
itself alone in opposing the document on the principles of settling the<br>
Karabakh conflict as defined in Cotti's statement: territorial integrity of<br>
Azerbaijan, a high degree of autonomy for Karabakh within that country, and<br>
mutual security guarantees. This stance, which has taken increasingly firm<br>
shape over the last year, has encouraged Azerbaijan's intransigence and can<br>
only delay a political settlement of the conflict, since Armenian historical<br>
experience and that of Karabakh in particular preclude acceptance of<br>
Azerbaijani rule.<br>
<p>
SELEZNEV DISCOVERS "ANTI-RUSSIAN MOODS" IN GEORGIA. Russian Duma chairman<br>
Gennady Seleznev, in Tbilisi for a session of the Parliamentary Assembly of<br>
the Black Sea Economic Cooperation, addressed the Georgian parliament<br>
yesterday. Seleznev conditioned Russia's ratification of the<br>
Russian-Georgian good-neighborly relations treaty on Tbilisi's own<br>
ratification of an agreement on Russian military bases in Georgia and on<br>
other concessions by Tbilisi. The latter should include the establishment of<br>
a Russian General Consulate in Batumi where "30,000 Russian-speakers<br>
including Russian military reside," Seleznev said. In a follow-up statement<br>
he opposed Georgia's claim to a share of the ex-Soviet Black Sea Fleet. <br>
<p>
Seleznev complained of "anti-Russian moods" after the opposition<br>
National-Democratic parliamentary group walked out during his speech.<br>
Georgian parliament chairman Zurab Zhvania responded that "those of our<br>
statements that Russia deems sharp actually reflect the public opinion in<br>
our country." He also described Russian policy on Abkhazia as "the main<br>
stumbling block" in bilateral relations. (Interfax, ORT, December 12)<br>
<p>
The visit took place in the long shadow of Georgian president Eduard<br>
Shevardnadze's demonstrative cancellation of a scheduled meeting with<br>
Seleznev after the Duma's March 1996 resolutions asserting the continuity of<br>
the USSR. Shevardnadze and cabinet of ministers head Niko Lekishvili<br>
received Seleznev on this visit but complained of Russian policies,<br>
including economic ones, toward Georgia. (See Monitor, December 11) Tbilisi<br>
attaches considerable -- and perhaps excessive -- value to Russian<br>
ratification of the bilateral treaty because it stipulates respect for<br>
existing borders. Moscow hopes that Tbilisi will pay the price for<br>
ratification in military bases.<br>

RUSSIAN JOURNALISTS REMEMBER SLAIN COLLEAGUES. Russian journalists yesterday<br>
held a memorial day for colleagues who lost their lives during the course of<br>
their work. Secretary of the Russian Union of Journalists Pavel Gutiontov<br>
told a news conference that, over the past five years, 135 Russian<br>
journalists and eleven foreign reporters have lost their lives on the<br>
territory of the former Soviet Union. Many were murdered, and virtually none<br>
of the crimes have been solved. Moscow is the most dangerous beat: 27<br>
journalists have died there in the past five years. Next were Chechnya,<br>
Tajikistan and Abkhazia. (Itar-Tass, December 10; Interfax, December 11)<br>
<p>
COALMINERS' UNION CALLS OFF STRIKE; SOME MINERS CONTINUE PROTEST. There are<br>
conflicting reports from Russia over the status of the nationwide<br>
coalminers' strike that began eleven days ago. According to some reports,<br>
miners remain on strike today at mines in scattered regions. Yesterday,<br>
however, the leaders of Russia's main coalmining union said they had decided<br>
to call off the strike after receiving government assurances that all wage<br>
arrears will be paid off by the end of this month. (BBC World Service,<br>
December 12) <br>
<p>
AIRCRAFT PRODUCERS UNITE. Moscow's Mil Helicopter Plant on December 9 became<br>
the fourth partner in an effort to create an aviation-based<br>
financial-industrial-group that already includes the aircraft producers<br>
Sukhoi and Yak, as well as the Tupolev ANTK complex. The original trio<br>
signed an agreement launching the effort on December 3. The goal is to<br>
create an integrated organizational structure that will allow the member<br>
companies to better compete in the highly-competitive international aircraft<br>
market. (Kommersant-daily, December 6, 10)<br>
<p>
MORE RUSSIAN WEAPONRY TO SOUTH KOREA. It was announced in Seoul yesterday<br>
that South Korea will take delivery next year on some $31 million worth of<br>
Russian-made BMP-3 armored combat vehicles, spare parts, and ammunition. The<br>
deal, signed in Moscow this month, is part of an earlier agreement that<br>
calls for Russia to provide South Korea with $210 million in military<br>
hardware as partial payment for debts owed by Moscow. Seoul traditionally<br>
has been a customer of U.S. military hardware. (AP, December 11)<br>
<p>
RUSSIA, CHINA SIGN DEFENSE MEMORANDUM. Russian deputy prime minister Aleksei<br>
Bolshakov yesterday signed a memorandum on military-technical cooperation<br>
with the Deputy Chairman of China's Central Military Council. The agreement,<br>
which envisions cooperation in the conversion of defense enterprises and the<br>
modernization of China's armed forces, was said to represent a further<br>
consolidation of political, economic, and defense ties between the two Asian<br>
giants. Additional agreements are expected to be signed later this month<br>
when Chinese prime minister Li Peng visits Moscow. (Itar-Tass, December 11)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS WORKERS PROTEST. More than 100 representatives of<br>
the factories that both build and dismantle Russia's nuclear weapons<br>
picketed Government House in Moscow yesterday. They were protesting the fact<br>
that they have not been paid for many months. Vladimir Kaskin, a union<br>
official, said that the government owed the workers 1.3 trillion rubles.<br>
(RIA-Novosti, December 11)<br>
<p>
SOCIAL PACT REACHED IN KAZAKHSTAN. A general labor agreement for 1997 was<br>
recently signed in Kazakhstan by the government and representatives of<br>
workers and employers. Under the terms of the agreement, trade unions will<br>
not conduct any protest actions during the year. But a representative of the<br>
unions observed that the government's failure to fulfill its obligations in<br>
a similar pact reached last year had led to widespread protest actions<br>
across the country on October 17. (Interfax, December 10)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
RUSSIA AGREES TO TALKS WITH NATO. While reiterating Russia's continued<br>
opposition to any eastward expansion of NATO, Foreign Minister Yevgeny<br>
Primakov yesterday said in Brussels that Russia was willing to enter into<br>
negotiations with the Alliance "in order to settle any issues that might be<br>
of concern to us." He spoke after meeting with the NATO foreign ministers.<br>
Primakov stressed that any subsequent agreement must be far more than just a<br>
general set of principles and should contain "very specific, very concrete"<br>
points dealing with Russia's security concerns. He also repeated Russia's<br>
view that the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)<br>
should be the leading body in any new European security system, but seemed<br>
reconciled to the reality of NATO's predominance. "NATO is a real<br>
organization, a real force," he said, " and we as pragmatists will take this<br>
into account." (Reuter, RIA-Novosti, Itar-Tass, December 11) In Moscow,<br>
meanwhile, Defense Council secretary Yuri Baturin said yesterday that<br>
although NATO at present does not constitute a military threat to Russia,<br>
its expansion is inconsistent with the interests of European security.<br>
(Interfax, December 11)<br>
<p>
DECISION ON DEFENSE MINISTER COULD HERALD BIG CHANGES IN RUSSIA'S MILITARY<br>
ESTABLISHMENT. The decision yesterday to retire Defense Minister Igor<br>
Rodionov from the armed forces while concurrently retaining him in his<br>
current post had all the markings of yet another hastily conceived personnel<br>
action devised by the Kremlin for fleeting political advantages. In fact,<br>
however, the move could have far-reaching implications for Russia's defense<br>
establishment and appears to be part of a broader effort to push forward<br>
much needed reform in that troubled arena. The most immediate consequence is<br>
that Russia now has a civilian defense minister. This is a change that<br>
military reformers have lobbied hard for since before the dissolution of the<br>
Soviet Union, but which has been strongly opposed by more traditional<br>
elements in society and, especially, in the uniformed officer corps. <br>
<p>
As a career military officer Rodionov may not fit neatly into Western<br>
definitions of "civilian," but because he carries sufficient authority<br>
within the defense establishment his change of status may be the best way to<br>
move Russia to a point where, in the future, a true civilian can be<br>
appointed. In remarks yesterday President Boris Yeltsin implicitly made this<br>
point. He appeared to underline that Russia's Defense Ministry will<br>
henceforth be headed by a civilian and that the decision on Rodionov was<br>
taken with an eye toward the practices of democratic societies. Yeltsin and<br>
other Russian leaders also emphasized that Rodionov's change of status in no<br>
way reflects a diminution of his powers, and several of them suggested that<br>
the change might even allow Rodionov to operate more effectively in<br>
political terms. More immediately, yesterday's events appeared to be a vote<br>
of confidence for Rodionov at a time when he is under fire both for the<br>
botched sacking of Russia's ground forces commander-in-chief and for the<br>
still halting pace of military reform. (Itar-Tass, Interfax, December 10)<br>
<p>
There was also speculation in Moscow yesterday that Rodionov's change of<br>
status dovetails with long discussed proposals to differentiate more clearly<br>
the functions of Russia's Defense Ministry and General Staff in a fashion<br>
that would enhance the latter agency's role in operational matters. Indeed,<br>
Russian Security Council secretary Ivan Rybkin claimed earlier this week<br>
that Yeltsin intends to issue a decree in February that will not only<br>
increase the General Staff's authority within the regular armed forces, but<br>
that will extend its oversight responsibilities to Russia's myriad other<br>
"power ministries." (Nezavisimaya gazeta, December 11) Questions of this<br>
sort presumably also arose during yesterday's meeting of the Russian Defense<br>
Council, at which proposals on military reform were discussed. The few<br>
details of the meeting that were immediately available suggested that the<br>
Kremlin may be close to approving a comprehensive military reform plan that<br>
is sure to generate opposition within the broad defense establishment. For<br>
that very reason its success will require both that the men atop the Defense<br>
Ministry and General Staff fully support the reform effort, and that they<br>
command sufficient authority to push through the unpopular changes. Neither<br>
of these conditions is a given.<br>
<p>
RUSSIA MARKS CONSTITUTION DAY, CHECHNYA THE ANNIVERSARY OF RUSSIA'S INVASION<br>
"TO RESTORE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER." Today is Constitution Day, a national<br>
holiday in Russia. President Boris Yeltsin proclaimed yesterday in an<br>
address to the nation that Russia's three-year-old constitution has stood<br>
the test of time and that, the predictions of doomsayers notwithstanding,<br>
presidential and  parliamentary elections took place in Russia according to<br>
schedule and the  losing side recognized their validity. "The constitution<br>
triumphed. Even those  who do not like the constitution propose to change it<br>
only by constitutional means." This proves, Yeltsin concluded, "that the<br>
changes that have begun in the country are irreversible." (Itar-Tass,<br>
December 11)<br>
<p>
But Yeltsin's address was issued in written form and received scant coverage<br>
in the  mass media. Last night's Russian TV news concentrated instead on a<br>
day-long mass meeting held yesterday in the central square of Grozny that<br>
marked the second  anniversary of Russia's military intervention in<br>
Chechnya. Yeltsin's address did not refer to the fact that federal troops<br>
were ordered into Chechnya in December 1994 to "restore constitutional<br>
order." Nor was Russian TV's coverage very  enlightening. The newsreader<br>
explained that, since all the speakers at the rally spoke in Chechen, "it's<br>
hard to tell you precisely what they said," except that the words "Djokhar,"<br>
"Islam," and "Chechens" predominated. (RTR, December 11)<br>
<p>
EUROPEAN UNION TO PROTEST NEW RUSSIAN TRANSPORT TAX. A row is brewing<br>
between Moscow and the European Union over a decision by the Russian Duma to<br>
charge a $10 duty for every crossing of the Russian border by an individual<br>
or consignment of goods. The decision takes the form of amendments to the<br>
law on the state border and is expected to be implemented within 4 to 8<br>
weeks. Certain categories of people will be exempt from the duty, including<br>
civil servants on official business, World War II veterans, and CIS<br>
residents crossing borders inside the CIS. Russian citizens leaving or<br>
entering the country from a non-CIS country will not however be exempt.<br>
Aircraft, trains, trucks and cars will be taxed according to the number of<br>
passengers and amount of cargo, with a rate of $180 on all trucks.<br>
(Itar-Tass, December 11; Financial Times, December 12) <br>
<p>
The European Commission has instructed its ambassador in Moscow to make a<br>
formal complaint to the Russian government. The Commission says the new duty<br>
"goes against the spirit" of the interim agreement on trade signed between<br>
the EU and Russia last summer. It will also harm Russian exporters, the<br>
Commission points out.<br>
<p>
The duty will be levied by Russia's border troops and will help to finance<br>
their work. The border troops will also be allowed to keep 25 percent of the<br>
value of any contraband seized at the border. Clearly, the system will be<br>
wide open to abuse. <br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT'S CHIEF OF STAFF REMOVED. By virtue of a December 10<br>
presidential decree, Leonid Kuchma has dismissed the head of the<br>
presidential administration, Dmytro Tabachnyk, and also stripped him of the<br>
military ranks he had acquired in 1994 and 1995. In a related move, Kuchma<br>
demoted Lt. Gen. Hryhory Dyachuk, head of the armed forces' main personnel<br>
directorate. The announcement on Tabachnyk's removal said only that the<br>
action had been taken "in connection with his transfer to another job" -- a<br>
formula often used to indicate political disgrace. There was no immediate<br>
announcement of a replacement for Tabachnyk. (Interfax-Ukraine, December 11)<br>
<p>
Reported to be 33 years of age and in his post since 1994, Tabachnyk was<br>
considered the most influential Ukrainian official after the president<br>
himself and a real power behind the throne. His rise followed his masterful<br>
organization of Kuchma's 1994 election campaign, and he continued to<br>
function afterward as presidential speech-writer, image-polisher, and<br>
political handler. But Tabachnyk's unique position of influence and his<br>
control over access to the president eventually earned him more enemies than<br>
friends, and he increasingly came under attack in the press and parliament,<br>
with whose chairman, Oleksandr Moroz, he also clashed. The legislature's<br>
commission against crime and corruption spearheaded the drive against<br>
Tabachnyk with charges that he had unlawfully acquired both a second<br>
apartment in Kiev and a high military rank. Tabachnyk is a civilian who made<br>
a name for himself as a writer on Ukrainian military history, and is<br>
believed to be the country's youngest Colonel. Kuchma stuck by Tabachnyk<br>
until the younger man turned into a political liability. Tabachnyk's<br>
departure leaves Security and Defense Council secretary Volodymyr Horbulin<br>
as the most influential man in the president's entourage. Tabachnyk and<br>
Horbulin were not known to have been rivals.<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS <br>
<p>
AZERBAIJAN ARRESTS DEFEATED REBELS. Nineteen participants of the March 1995<br>
armed rebellion against president Haidar Aliev -- most of them former OPON<br>
(earlier OMON) officers -- have been arrested in Azerbaijan. The chief catch<br>
in the latest roundup is Yelcin Amiraslanov, who commanded the OPON unit in<br>
Kazakh district. (Turan, December 10-11) The rebellion there, like that in<br>
Baku, was defeated by army troops, and the OPON was dissolved as a force.<br>
The runaway Amiraslanov had recently returned to the Kazakh district and is<br>
being held responsible for the assassination of four security and police<br>
officers there last October. <br>
<p>
Last week, the authorities arrested about a dozen individuals implicated in<br>
the "Generals' plot" -- an attempt to assassinate Aliev in the summer of<br>
1995. Among those rounded up were the former press secretaries of the<br>
republic's ex-Communist party leader and president Ayaz Mutalibov and<br>
ex-prime minister Suret Huseinov, both of whom conspired against Aliev with<br>
Russian support. The three Generals who led that plot are already in<br>
detention. (Turan, December 12) The OPON and the other group face<br>
high-treason charges.<br>
<p>
ARMENIA SENTENCES ALLEGED "DRO" PLOTTERS. Armenia's Supreme Court on<br>
December 10 sentenced three alleged terrorists to death and eight others to<br>
prison terms ranging from 3 to 15 years. One other defendant died under<br>
suspicious circumstances in detention during the trial, which lasted a year<br>
and a half. The defendants were accused of being members in a secret cell --<br>
"Dro" -- comprised of assassins and drug-traffickers operating for the<br>
Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Dashnaksutyun. The sentences are<br>
appealable within seven days. A parallel trial of another 31 similarly<br>
charged defendants is still in progress. (Noyan-Tapan, Interfax, Western<br>
agencies, December 10-11)<br>
<p>
Both cases have been criticized as juridical flawed, displaying elements of<br>
political show trials, and designed to justify the authorities' ban on the<br>
ARF, the main opposition party. That ban was imposed after President Levon<br>
Ter-Petrosian's December 1994 speech that linked "Dro" to the ARF and<br>
signaled the government's turn to authoritarian methods. On the other hand,<br>
post-Soviet Armenia is not known to have carried out any death sentences<br>
handed down by the courts.<br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
TAJIK CEASEFIRE SIGNED. Tajik president Imomali Rahmonov and United Tajik<br>
Opposition chairman Saidabdullo Nuri, meeting in Hostdeh, northeastern<br>
Afghanistan, on December 10-11, signed a ceasefire agreement, effective as<br>
of today. It envisages a disengagement of forces in the Jirgatal, Kataregin,<br>
Garm, and Tavildara areas of central Tajikistan, demilitarization of the<br>
district centers, free movement on the crucial east-west highway, a joint<br>
government-opposition customs and crossing post on the Tajik-Kyrgyz border,<br>
exchange of prisoners, and monitoring by the UN military observer mission.<br>
Some government units appear to be exempted from the disengagement<br>
provisions. The initial reports, all by Russian agencies, are confused on<br>
the details. <br>
<p>
The ceasefire will be in force until the two leaders meet again in Moscow on<br>
December 19 to work out a political agreement on settling the inter-Tajik<br>
conflict, and it will be extended if they then agree to meet again in late<br>
December to sign the political agreement. A draft of that agreement,<br>
initialed yesterday, provides at least in part for creating a national<br>
reconciliation commission to be chaired by the opposition. The commission's<br>
powers shall be defined in the political agreement due to be finalized in<br>
Moscow. A joint working group has been tasked to develop that document.<br>
(Interfax, Itar-Tass, December 11)<br>
<p>
Previous ceasefire agreements have foundered on details, while the political<br>
agreement has remained elusive because of Dushanbe's refusal to share<br>
political power with the opposition and accept free elections. The current<br>
military situation on the threshold of winter should motivate both sides to<br>
observe the ceasefire at least generally, while perhaps continuing to jockey<br>
for local gains. The prospects of a political agreement, however, look poor<br>
in light of indications that Dushanbe continues to see the National<br>
Conciliation Commission as largely symbolic, whereas the opposition insists<br>
on creating real power-sharing bodies.<br>
<p>
Mediated by UN envoy Hans-Dietrich Merrem and pushed by Moscow, the<br>
Rahmonov-Nuri meeting was held in the area controlled by the<br>
Russian-supported former leaders of Afghanistan, Burhanuddin Rabani and<br>
Ahmad Shah-Masood. The UN Secretary General's envoy has in recent months<br>
supported holding the decisive talks in Moscow under Russian mediation,<br>
entailing in effect a transfer of mediating responsibility from the UN as a<br>
neutral to Russia as a party to the conflict. Such deference to Moscow may<br>
have been a by-product of Russian support for UN secretary general Boutros<br>
Boutros-Ghali's only recently shattered bid for reelection.<br>

<p>
RUSSIA GETS ITS FIRST CIVILIAN DEFENSE MINISTER. Russia got its first<br>
civilian defense minister today when President Boris Yeltsin released Gen.<br>
Igor Rodionov from military service but retained him as defense minister. On<br>
December 1 Rodionov turned 60--the military's mandatory retirement age.<br>
Rodionov was appointed to the post in July of this year. (Itar-Tass December<br>
11)=20<br>
<p>
MOSCOW WANTS DIALOGUE ON NATO ENLARGEMENT. Russian foreign minister Evgeni<br>
Primakov said today that Russia remains opposed to NATO expansion but wants<br>
to maintain a dialogue with the alliance. He was speaking after a meeting<br>
this morning with NATO officials in Brussels. (BBC World Service, December<br>
11. See Perspective item below)<br>
<p>
CLINTON ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE EUROPEAN SECURITY A TOP PRIORITY. Incoming<br>
U.S. national security advisor Sandy Berger has identified the building of a<br>
"democratic and united Europe around an expanding NATO and a partnership<br>
with Russia" as the top foreign policy priority of the Clinton<br>
Administration in its second term. Berger also identified a "cluster of new<br>
security challenges" such as drugs, terrorism, rogue states, and the<br>
environment as among the administration's top five foreign policy<br>
priorities. (AP, December 8)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE LOOKS TO MEDIA. According to a Russian daily, the<br>
Federal Security Service plans to create a new department that will attempt<br>
to influence the way in which issues deemed to be of importance to Russian<br>
national security are reported by the media. Moscow's failure to shape<br>
public opinion during the war in Chechnya was said to be a primary reason<br>
for the counter-intelligence agency's latest plans, which, as the newspaper<br>
suggested, evoke memories of the Soviet KGB and its control and manipulation<br>
of the news. (Izvestiya, December 7)=20<br>
<p>
KAZAKHSTAN'S FIRST EUROBOND ISSUE IS SUCCESSFUL. Kazakhstan placed its first<br>
$200 million eurobond issue on December 9. According to Kazakhstan's finance<br>
minister, yield on the Kazakh eurobonds will be 9.25 percent and the<br>
repayment period three years. Although demand exceeded supply by nearly<br>
three times, the Kazakh government--taking into account the role given in<br>
the budget to foreign financing -- considered it advisable only to double<br>
its initial offering of eurobonds. (Interfax, December 10)<br>
<p>
LITHUANIAN CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT APPROVED AND SWORN IN. Lithuania's new<br>
government yesterday had its program approved by parliament and was sworn<br>
in. The program envisages acceleration of market reforms, ambitious growth<br>
targets, all-out efforts to join the European Union and NATO, and close<br>
relations with Poland; relations with Russia or CIS are not mentioned. The<br>
government relies on a conservative majority of more than two thirds of the<br>
parliament. The left-of-center opposition described the program as "serving<br>
big capital." (BNS, Itar-Tass, December 10)<br>
<p>
MCDONALDS' BELARUS FESTIVITY MARRED. Minsk police yesterday used truncheons<br>
to disperse a crowd of up to 4,000, many of them students, attracted by the<br>
opening of McDonalds' first fast-food restaurant in Belarus. The company,<br>
which intends to open two additional restaurants there, had prepared an<br>
elaborate festivity as Belarus became the 100th country or territory in<br>
which McDonalds does business. Also yesterday, the police arrested<br>
approximately 10 students from a large group protesting against President<br>
Aleksandr Lukashenko on International Human Rights Day. (Western agencies,<br>
December 10)<br>
<p>
GEORGIA VIRTUALLY ABOLISHES CAPITAL PUNISHMENT. Marking International Human<br>
Rights Day yesterday, Georgian president Eduard Shevardnadze officially<br>
instituted a moratorium on death sentences and forwarded amendments to the<br>
penal code for immediate parliamentary enactment. The amendments eliminate<br>
capital punishment for high treason and all other crimes except premeditated<br>
murder with aggravating circumstances. Georgia has for the last two years<br>
observed a de facto moratorium on carrying out death sentences. The Council<br>
of Europe and other fora demand this of ex-Communist countries in general.<br>
(Interfax, December 10)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN ARMY IN TAJIKISTAN THREATENS COUNTER-RETALIATION. Russian diplomats<br>
and the "peacekeeping" military command in Tajikistan have warned that any<br>
Tajik opposition attacks on Russian troops would be answered with "extreme<br>
force.". The warning is a response to opposition threats of retaliation<br>
against Russian forces for using their aviation to support Tajik regime<br>
troops. Tajik insurgents last week attacked Russian military helicopters<br>
parked at Dushanbe airport; and another Russian soldier was killed yesterday<br>
in Dushanbe.(Interfax, December 10; Itar-Tass, December 10-11)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
NATO EXPANSION CLOCK IS TICKING. When they meet in Madrid in July next year,<br>
the leaders of the 16 NATO countries will invite "one or more countries" to<br>
start accession negotiations with the Alliance, with the goal of welcoming<br>
the new member(s) by the time of NATO's 50th anniversary in 1999. Such was<br>
the decision of the NATO foreign ministers when they met yesterday in<br>
Brussels as the North Atlantic Council. The ministers tried to balance this<br>
announcement--sure to be ill-received in Moscow--with steps more amenable to<br>
Russia: they pledged to build "a strong security partnership with Russia"<br>
and avowed that they had no intention, plan, or reason to deploy nuclear<br>
weapons on the territory of any new members. By next summer's summit they<br>
hope also to have negotiated an agreement with Russia, one that "could take<br>
the form of a Charter," which would formalize this new relationship and<br>
would ensure that the two parties had "a strong, flexible means to consult<br>
and cooperate as part of [an] evolving relationship." The Russians have yet<br>
to agree to these talks.=20<br>
<p>
Russia was not the only component of the former Soviet Union to get special<br>
mention. The ministers also spoke of building a "distinctive=85and enhanced<br>
relationship with Ukraine." After the meeting, NATO secretary-general Javier<br>
Solana announced that a NATO information office would be established in<br>
Kiev. (NATO Communique, press release, December 10)<br>
<p>
The NATO leaders also endorsed a call yesterday by the U.S. to demand that<br>
Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic open a dialogue with opposition leaders<br>
and recognize last month's municipal elections. A NATO statement "strongly<br>
deplored" the Serbian government's nullification of those results and called<br>
on Milosevic to reverse the decision. Moscow has been a steadfast defender<br>
of Milosevic and of Serbian interests throughout the former Yugoslavia, and<br>
the prospect loomed that Russia would find itself isolated on this issue<br>
along with that of NATO enlargement, as had been the case at the OSCE Summit<br>
in Lisbon on December 2-3. (Western agencies, December 10)<br>
<p>
In Moscow, meanwhile, there was little evidence of any bend in Russia's<br>
position on NATO. Presidential press spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky strongly<br>
denied Western speculation that Russian opposition to NATO enlargement had<br>
softened, and declared that Moscow continues to believe that enlargement<br>
would "isolate Russia and create potential threats to Russia's national<br>
interests...including military threats." (Interfax, December 10) Beginning<br>
especially with then Security Council secretary Aleksandr Lebed's visit to<br>
Brussels in early October, there had been signs that Moscow was resigning<br>
itself to NATO's plans. In the lead-up to the OSCE meeting, however, the<br>
Russian Foreign Ministry appeared finally to have quieted such dissenting<br>
views, and Russia's political elites have spoke in one voice against<br>
enlargement since that time.=20<br>
<p>
CHERNOMYRDIN PROMISES TO PAY WAGE AND PENSION ARREARS BY YEAR'S END. Russian<br>
prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told the upper house of the Russian<br>
parliament yesterday that the government will pay wage and pension arrears<br>
to state-employees by the end of this month. The only exception will be<br>
arrears to the military, which, he promised, will be paid off in January<br>
1997. (Itar-Tass, BBC World Service, December 10) Although there were signs<br>
yesterday that the eight-day nationwide miners' strike was beginning to<br>
wane, the government seems to have been alarmed by the outbreak of wildcat<br>
strikes--of teachers, nurses and power workers -- all over the country.<br>
Chernomyrdin did not say where the Kremlin would find the money, but<br>
insisted that the government would resist the temptation to print it.<br>
Russia's recent eurobond issue exceeded expectations, tax receipts are said<br>
to be going up, and the government has hopes that the IMF will soon decide<br>
to unfreeze payment of its extended loan to Russia.<br>
<p>
AIRBORNE TROOPS GET ONE OF THEIR OWN AS NEW COMMANDER. Two months after the<br>
previous commander of the Airborne Troops had been sacked, President Boris<br>
Yeltsin yesterday named Lt. Gen. Georgi Shpak to the post, thus ending<br>
speculation that a non-paratrooper might be brought in to lead the airborne<br>
forces during their controversial downsizing. Shpak once commanded the 76th<br>
Airborne Division and most recently was chief of staff of the Volga Military<br>
district. His name had been mentioned for the airborne position in<br>
mid-November. Shpak fought in Afghanistan and his son, an airborne<br>
lieutenant, was killed in Chechnya last year.=20<br>
<p>
Yeltsin's decree was said to have been signed on December 4, but the<br>
appointment was only made public yesterday when Shpak was introduced to his<br>
new staff. The same decree formally dismissed his predecessor, Col. Gen.<br>
Yevgeny Podkolzin, on the grounds that he had reached the mandatory<br>
retirement age of 60. That was also the reason given when he was sacked on<br>
October 3. (Interfax, December 10) Podkolzin, who turned 60 last April, is<br>
believed to have been an opponent of the Defense Ministry's plans to<br>
downsize the Airborne Troops. Those plans have created considerable<br>
dissension in the ranks of the elite forces.=20<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
UKRAINE DENIES ARMS DEALS WITH LIBYA. Ukrainian deputy foreign minister<br>
Kostyantin Hryshchenko yesterday dismissed as "rubbish" a story carried by<br>
the Washington Times that cited CIA sources as alleging that Ukraine had<br>
reached a deal to sell missiles and provide naval maintenance services to<br>
Libya. (see Monitor, December 10). Hryshchenko added that "it is difficult<br>
to believe that the high-class CIA specialists could have prepared such an<br>
illiterate report." Hryshchenko and Foreign Ministry spokesman Yury Serhiev<br>
said that the charges aired via the article sought to "discredit Ukraine in<br>
the eyes of its strategic partner" -- the U.S. -- and that the charges also<br>
seemed timed to this week's opening in Vienna of a conference on dual-<br>
purpose technology export controls. Hryshchenko also emphasized that the<br>
"U.S. government has not expressed any doubt or lack of confidence in<br>
Ukraine's compliance with the rules on nuclear and missile technology<br>
exports" after the publication of a similar story in June.<br>
(Interfax-Ukraine, December 9 and 10)<br>
<p>
CRIMEAN PARLIAMENT APPROVES CONSTITUTION -- WITH RESERVATIONS. The Crimean<br>
parliament has approved the latest draft Crimean constitution on the first<br>
reading. This is the version hammered out last month by a task force of<br>
Ukrainian and Crimean lawmakers. However, many deputies objected to the<br>
compromises worked out by the task force and final adoption of a new<br>
constitution for the autonomous republic still seems far away.<br>
(Trud-Ukraina, December 7)<br>
<p>
Language is a key problem. The original draft states that Ukrainian, Russian<br>
and Crimean Tatar are all state languages in Crimea. The Ukrainian<br>
authorities want this brought into line with Ukrainian law, under which only<br>
Ukrainian has the status of state language. Russian and Crimean Tatar would<br>
be reduced to the status of "official languages." But deputies representing<br>
Crimea's ethnic Russian population want Russian to retain the status of<br>
state language, while Crimean Tatar deputies want to strengthen, not weaken,<br>
the status of their language.<br>
<p>
Another dispute concerns the composition of the Crimean parliament. At<br>
present, it is a unicameral body consisting of 94 deputies. Kiev wants it to<br>
become a bicameral body of 50 deputies. (Itar-Tass, November 20) Related to<br>
this is the issue of parliamentary representation for the Crimean Tatars.<br>
Under the present arrangement, they have guaranteed representation with 14<br>
deputies. The latest draft constitution calls for proportional<br>
representation, which would reduce the number of Tatar deputies to around<br>
ten (reflecting the fact that ethnic Tatars make up about 10 percent of the<br>
population). This is more attractive to the Tatars than direct majority<br>
voting, which would almost certainly deprive them of representation<br>
altogether, but they would prefer to keep the current system of guaranteed<br>
representation.<br>
<p>
Over the past two years Kiev delayed approving the Crimean constitution,<br>
preferring to give precedence to the adoption of Ukraine's own new<br>
constitution, to which Crimea's constitution has to conform. But Moscow's<br>
reentry onto the scene, with the Russian parliament's recent assertion of<br>
Russian sovereignty over Sevastopol, threatens to provoke fresh tensions<br>
between Kiev and Simferopol. As long as Russia was bogged down in Chechnya,<br>
the Yeltsin leadership had little appetite for foreign adventures and did<br>
not encourage Russian nationalist parliamentarians in their effort to fan<br>
separatist sentiments in Crimea. But now that the first shots have been<br>
fired in the 2000 Russian presidential election, it may be that the window<br>
of opportunity for Kiev and Simferopol to regularize their relations is<br>
about to close. Kiev has little to gain from a further delay in the adoption<br>
of a Crimean constitution that would anchor the peninsula in an independent<br>
Ukraine. But the volatility of the Russian political situation threatens to<br>
give Simferopol back some of the leverage it lost during the Chechen=<br>
 conflict.<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
GEORGIAN-RUSSIAN ECONOMIC RELATIONS ALSO IN CRISIS. Georgian president<br>
Eduard Shevardnadze and State Minister (equivalent of prime minister) Niko<br>
Lekishvili yesterday complained to visiting Russian Duma chairman Gennady<br>
Seleznev that Georgia has been practically "cut off from the Russian<br>
market." They noted that Russia has fallen to seventh place among Georgia's<br>
trade partners, while Turkey now holds first place "because its market is<br>
open." Shevardnadze complained particularly of Russian barriers to<br>
traditional Georgian exports of fruit and vegetables, wine, and tea -- of<br>
which Georgia used to be the Russian Federation's chief supplier. (Interfax,<br>
Itar-Tass, ORT, December 10)<br>
<p>
Also yesterday, Georgian officials announced that Moscow has rejected<br>
International Monetary Fund recommendations to restructure Georgian debts<br>
worth $147 million that stem from Russian loans in 1992-94. As per the IMF's<br>
recommendations to a group of debtor and creditor countries, Georgia had<br>
proposed to Russia, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Iran to<br>
restructure Georgian debts by means of a five year grace period for<br>
repayments on the principal and a reduction of annual interest to four<br>
percent from the usual seven. All the countries agreed except Russia.<br>
Turkmenistan is owed approximately $400 million by Georgia. (Financial<br>
Information Agency, December 10)<br>
<p>
AJARIAN SHOT ACROSS GEORGIA'S BOW? The Ajarian Autonomous Republic's Supreme<br>
Soviet issued on December 9 a statement protesting against Tbilisi's refusal<br>
to authorize the creation of a free economic zone in the Black Sea port of<br>
Batumi, Ajaria's capital. The statement accused Tbilisi of "ignoring the<br>
autonomous republic's interests" and of "solving none of Ajaria's pressing<br>
problems in the last few years." The Georgian parliament last week held<br>
hearings during which most participants opposed an Ajarian free economic<br>
zone out of a concern that it could stimulate "separatism." President Eduard<br>
Shevardnadze then told the press that creating the zone "would be premature<br>
at this point." (Interfax, December 9).<br>
<p>
The Ajarian protest is unprecedented in its openness, tone, and apparent<br>
attempt to draw international attention by being timed to the opening in<br>
Tbilisi of a session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea Economic<br>
Cooperation (PABSEC). Until now, Ajaria has been an oasis of stability in<br>
stark contrast to Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Ajarian Supreme Soviet<br>
chairman Aslan Abashidze, in firm control of his republic, has consistently<br>
maintained cooperative relations with Tbilisi, as he also has with<br>
neighboring Turkey and with the Russian military based in Ajaria. Tbilisi<br>
cannot afford a third breakaway movement.<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN BORDER TROOPS WELCOME BUT STARVING IN ARMENIA. The commander of<br>
Russia's border troops, Gen. Andrei Nikolaev, conferred in Yerevan with<br>
President Levon Ter-Petrosian and Internal Affairs and National Security<br>
Minister Serge Sarksian on "additional measures to improve the supply and<br>
staffing" of Russian border troops deployed in Armenia. Nikolaev praised the<br>
Armenian leadership for adhering to both the concept of "joint protection of<br>
the CIS outer borders" in its cooperation with Russia and to CIS collective<br>
security agreements. (Noyan-Tapan, Azg, December 9; Interfax, December 7-8)<br>
In contrast, Azerbaijani president Haidar Aliev called for the withdrawal of<br>
Russian border troops from the Transcaucasus. (Turan, December 9) Azerbaijan<br>
has no Russian troops on its territory. Georgia seeks to develop its own<br>
border troops in order to replace the Russian ones on the Georgian-Turkish<br>
border.<br>
<p>
The Russian border troops' "Armenia" grouping is stationed on Armenia's<br>
borders with Turkey and Iran under a September 1992 Russian-Armenian<br>
agreement. The force is financed jointly, and its personnel includes many<br>
Armenians, some of them holding Russian citizenship. A Russian television<br>
report just aired from the Armenian-Turkish border showed a Russian border<br>
troop unit unable to provide food for its men and dogs or fuel for its<br>
vehicles, and whose starving soldiers scavenge for food in the neighborhood.<br>
It also suggested that border guards allow individual Kurdish guerrillas to<br>
cross over from Turkey and rest in Kurdish villages on the Armenian side of<br>
the border before returning to fight. (Russian TV, December 9-10)<br>

NEWS:<br>
<p>
YELTSIN MOVES TO HUNTING LODGE NEAR MOSCOW. Russian president Boris Yeltsin<br>
was flown yesterday to the Rus hunting lodge at Zavidovo, 60 miles from<br>
Moscow, where he will spend the last stage of his convalescence. This was a<br>
favorite hunting spot of Soviet leaders, who liked to shoot wild boar or<br>
duck there. Yeltsin plans to return to work at the Kremlin on December 25,<br>
which is not celebrated as Christmas in Russia. (Itar-Tass, Reuters, December 9)<br>
<p>
CHECHNYA TO SEEK CIS MEMBERSHIP. Chechnya will apply to join the<br>
Commonwealth of Independent States, according to Chechen president Zelimkhan<br>
Yandarbiev. He says CIS membership would guarantee equal relations between<br>
Chechnya and the states that emerged when the Soviet Union collapsed. (Ekho<br>
Moskvy, December 9)<br>
<p>
INGUSH GOVERNMENT SACKED. President Ruslan Aushev of Ingushetia has<br>
dismissed the government of the north Caucasus republic. Aushev said he was<br>
dissatisfied with the government's management of the economy and that he<br>
plans to appoint a younger team. This is the second time Aushev has replaced<br>
the government in a year. (Itar-Tass, RTR, December 9) Ingushetia has<br>
ambitions to attract foreign investment and become one of the world's<br>
leading off-shore banking havens. A special economic zone, set up in<br>
Ingushetia two years ago to attract Russian investors, is to serve as the<br>
model for the regime that Moscow hopes to establish in neighboring Chechnya.<br>
(Financial Times, December 7)<br>
<p>
U.S. NODS TO RUSSIA IN NEW PLUTONIUM POLICY. To the consternation of many in<br>
the arms control community, the Clinton Administration announced yesterday<br>
that one of the two options that will be used for disposing of surplus U.S.<br>
weapons-grade plutonium will be to use it to fuel atomic power plants. The<br>
second disposal method chosen -- vitrification -- involves encasing the<br>
plutonium in glass for long-term storage. Russia has long advocated the<br>
former method, but many arms control experts fear it will aid nuclear<br>
weapons proliferation. (Washington Post, December 9)<br>
<p>
NO IMMEDIATE CONTRACTS FOR RUSSIAN OIL COMPANIES IN IRAQ. Russian oil<br>
companies will not be among the first to get Iraqi oil following approval of<br>
an "oil-for-food" deal between Baghdad and the UN. A Russian source said<br>
yesterday that representatives of Russian oil firms are in Baghdad, but it<br>
appears that Western companies will be the first to receive Iraqi oil. The<br>
long-negotiated deal with the UN permits Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of<br>
oil every six months to purchase necessities for the Iraqi people. (Reuter,<br>
December 9)<br>
<p>
MOSCOW DENIES INTELLIGENCE BREACH. Representatives of Russia's various<br>
secret services yesterday dismissed a report published in the German<br>
magazine Focus. The report claimed that a Russian intelligence officer had<br>
defected and turned over to the British information from KGB archives about<br>
a network of spies in Western Europe. The Russian representatives denied<br>
that there had been any recent defectors and claimed that, in any event, no<br>
one officer could acquire comprehensive information about an entire spy<br>
network. (Itar-Tass, Interfax, December 9)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN PILOT THAT SHOT DOWN KAL 007 SPEAKS. Retired Lt. Col. Gennadi<br>
Osipovich, the Soviet fighter who shot down Korean Airlines flight 007 13<br>
years ago, has admitted that he identified the plane as a commercial Boeing<br>
747 and not a spy plane. He also said he did not pass this information on to<br>
his ground controllers. Osipovich remains unrepentant about downing the<br>
plane and killing 269 people. "It is easy to turn a civilian type of plane<br>
into one for military use," he said. (New York Times, December 9)<br>
<p>
ABKHAZ OFFICERS KILLED IN GEORGIAN ATTACK. In their most stinging raid yet,<br>
Georgian guerrillas have killed three Abkhaz officers and seriously wounded<br>
two others in the Gali district, Abkhaz authorities acknowledged yesterday.<br>
Those authorities reserved the right to retaliate against Tbilisi, and<br>
complained about the failure of Russian "peacekeepers'" to intercept the<br>
attackers in the separation zone. (Interfax, November 9). Last week,<br>
official statements in Tbilisi credited ethnic Georgians in Abkhazia with<br>
having spontaneously started a guerrilla movement. The Abkhaz authorities<br>
hold Georgia's military and security agencies directly responsible. <br>
<p>
TALIBAN DELAYED INTER-TAJIK SUMMIT. UN-mediated talks between Tajik<br>
president Imomali Rahmonov and United Tajik Opposition leader Saidabdullo<br>
Nuri began today in northern Afghanistan after a day's delay. The<br>
UN-chartered plane bringing Nuri's party from Mashhad (Iran) was forced down<br>
yesterday by the Taliban, and the UTO delegation was brought to the Taliban<br>
leadership's Kandahar headquarters. Taliban spokesmen objected to the UN<br>
mission's failure to prenotify Taliban authorities of the flight. (Western<br>
agencies, December 9-10)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT GIVES GOVERNMENT BREATHING SPACE ON BUDGET. At its<br>
session last week, the Russian Duma decided to postpone voting on the<br>
government's revised draft of the 1997 federal budget until December 15,<br>
that is, after the national holiday set for December 12-13. Except for the<br>
pro-government "Russia is Our Home" and Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal<br>
Democrats, all factions of the Duma had threatened to vote against the<br>
draft. (Interfax, December 6) According to Nezavisimaya gazeta, the Duma<br>
postponed discussion of the budget as a gesture of support for Prime<br>
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who allegedly told faction leaders that, if<br>
parliament rejected the budget, he would be replaced in his post by Moscow<br>
mayor Yuri Luzhkov. <br>
<p>
The sting in the tail, according to the usually well-informed newspaper, was<br>
that the wily Chernomyrdin had another trick up his sleeve: had the Duma<br>
rejected the budget, "Russia is Our Home" would have moved a vote of no<br>
confidence in the government. This in turn would have allowed the president<br>
to dissolve parliament. (Nezavisimaya gazeta, December 7) Even the<br>
opposition newspaper, Pravda-5, admits that the opposition fears to reject<br>
the budget because deputies do not want to lose their parliamentary seats.<br>
"Deputies will not dare to reject it, because they care about their own<br>
interests and do not want to leave parliament and return to their former<br>
employers," the newspaper wrote. It predicted that, after putting up a show,<br>
parliament will adopt the government's draft budget with only cosmetic<br>
changes. (Pravda-5, December 4)<br>
<p>
MUSLIM LEADER ELECTED TO RUSSIAN DUMA. Nadir Khachilaev, who since the<br>
beginning of this year has been chairman of the Union of the Muslims of<br>
Russia (UMR), was elected to the Russian Duma on December 8 from a<br>
constituency in his native Makhachkala, capital of Dagestan. Khachilaev was<br>
elected to the seat vacated due to the assassination last August of<br>
Dagestan's finance minister. He defeated Communist candidate Khapisatu<br>
Gamzatov and former world wrestling champion Magomedkhan Gamzakhanov.<br>
(Interfax, December 9)<br>
<p>
The energetic Khachilaev, who made his name not as a religious leader but as<br>
karate champion of Dagestan, typifies a new generation of Dagestani<br>
politicians. Many are former athletes who went into business a decade ago,<br>
when Mikhail Gorbachev launched his reforms. A number of them have strong<br>
links to organized crime, and almost all of Dagestan's national movements<br>
now have their own detachments of well-armed "bodyguards." Officially,<br>
Khachilaev has never been a businessman and holds a low-paying position as<br>
chairman of Dagestan's boxing committee. Nonetheless, he is one of the<br>
richest people in the republic and owns a well-guarded three-story villa in<br>
the center of Makhachkala that was designed by his personal architect, as<br>
well as an estate in the mountains with a swimming pool and a small zoo.<br>
Until recently, Khachilaev had his own helicopter, but it was accidentally<br>
shot down by Russian troops. Politically, Khachilaev is expected to use his<br>
new status to mobilize broad-based opposition to Dagestan's present<br>
government. He may also try to form an Islamic faction in the Russian Duma.<br>
The UMR, founded in the middle of last year, has been engaged in uniting<br>
Russian adherents of Islam into a consolidated political force. It sprang to<br>
national prominence during the past summer, when Khachilaev mediated<br>
Aleksandr Lebed's first peacemaking meeting with Chechen leader Aslan<br>
Maskhadov. (Nezavisimaya gazeta, October 23)<br>
<p>
It is estimated that approximately 20 million Russian citizens (13 percent<br>
of the population) are Muslims. There are believed to be some 2.2. million<br>
Muslims in Dagestan; 2.5 million in Bashkortostan; 2 million in Tatarstan;<br>
one million in Chechnya; 0.7 million in Kabardino-Balkaria ; 0.4 million in<br>
Karachaevo-Cherkessia; 0.3 million in Ingushetia ; 0.2 million in North<br>
Ossetia; and 0.1 million in Adygeya. An additional 3.2 million are estimated<br>
to live in Central Russia, 1 million in the Volga region, and about half a<br>
million in Siberia and the Far East. (Nezavisimaya gazeta, July 25)<br>
<p>
STILL NO RESOLUTION TO SACKING OF MILITARY COMMANDER. Russian Ground Forces<br>
commander-in-chief Army General Vladimir Semenov remained in limbo over the<br>
weekend, as new allegations were voiced to justify his dismissal but a<br>
commission on top defense appointments apparently failed to resolve the<br>
case. Russia's Defense Ministry had announced Semenov's sacking on December<br>
2, but the Russian president's office (which must approve such actions)<br>
countermanded the ministry and said Semenov had only been suspended pending<br>
a review of his case. (See Monitor, December 3-6) That review was presumably<br>
to have taken place during a December 4 meeting of the president's<br>
commission for senior military appointments -- chaired by Defense Council<br>
secretary Yuri Baturin -- but reports out of Moscow differed as to whether<br>
the commission had even taken up Semenov's case. (Segodnya, ORT, Izvestiya,<br>
December 4)<br>
<p>
The consensus, however, was that Semenov would be removed, a view that was<br>
supported by a statement from the Russian president's office on December 6<br>
saying that a decree to that effect had been prepared. But the announcement<br>
also reportedly made no mention of Semenov having dishonored his uniform,<br>
which was the charge originally made public by Defense Minister Igor<br>
Rodionov as justification for the sacking. (Ekho Moskvy, December 6)<br>
Meanwhile, in the absence of any official information, the media continued<br>
to speculate luridly on the reasons for Semenov's problems. Some reports<br>
spoke of Semenov being blamed for Russia's dismal military performance in<br>
Chechnya or of his opposition to impending reductions in the size of the<br>
Ground Forces. Others, however, postulated Kremlin intrigues involving<br>
presidential chief-of-staff Anatoly Chubais and Interior Minister Anatoly<br>
Kulikov; illegal helicopter sales involving Semenov's wife, Madlena; or<br>
Rodionov's own desire to eliminate a potential rival. (Moskovsky<br>
komsomolets, Komsomolskaya pravda, December 4; NTV, December 5)<br>
<p>
The whole affair took an unexpected turn on December 7 when delegates at a<br>
congress of the Union of Muslims of Russia expressed their displeasure over<br>
Semenov's impending dismissal. (Ekho Moskvy, December 7) The Russian<br>
commander is an ethnic Ossetian who was born in Karachaevo-Cherkessia.<br>
(Izvestiya, December 3. See above.) <br>
<p>
While political intrigues of this sort have become nearly a daily occurrence<br>
in Russia, the corrosive affects of this one on the nation's already<br>
beleaguered and politicized officer corps should probably not be<br>
underestimated. According to Russian reports, the Ground Forces command is<br>
now in full disarray, and the deputy commander appointed to take over for<br>
Semenov has been reduced to calling the Defense Ministry daily for an answer<br>
as to who is actually in charge of Russia's Ground Forces. Such confusion is<br>
the last thing that the army needs as soldiers contemplate protests over<br>
wage arrears and dismal living conditions while the Defense Ministry embarks<br>
on painful and unpopular personnel reductions. (Kommersant-daily, December<br>
3; Obshchaya gazeta, No. 48)<br>
<p>
IRANIAN-RUSSIAN TRADE AGREEMENT. Iranian and Russian trade officials on<br>
December 5 announced the signing of a broad-ranging protocol aimed at<br>
boosting bilateral economic relations. The agreement, which calls for Tehran<br>
to purchase tens of millions of dollars worth of Russian subway cars and<br>
technical equipment, came during a meeting in Moscow of the Russian-Iranian<br>
Commission for Economic Cooperation. It was the first time that the<br>
commission has met since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.<br>
According to Russian foreign trade minister Oleg Davydov, the agreement will<br>
involve a wide variety of industries, including oil and gas, as well as air,<br>
land, and sea transport. The two sides also reaffirmed their intention to<br>
complete construction of Iran's $800 million Bushehr nuclear power plant, a<br>
project that the U.S. has vigorously opposed. Davydov projected that trade<br>
turnover between Iran and Russia could rise from the $200 million recorded<br>
in 1995 to some $4 billion by the year 2000. (Reuter, Itar-Tass, Interfax,<br>
December 5) <br>
<p>
The pattern of Russian-Iranian cooperation continued on December 6, when the<br>
head of Russia's Ministry for Emergency Situations said during a visit to<br>
Tehran that the Iranians could become major purchasers of Russian-made<br>
rescue machinery and equipment, including helicopters. Sergei Shoigu also<br>
spoke of broader interaction between his ministry and its counterparts in<br>
Iran. The Russian delegation brought with it 2.5 tons of humanitarian<br>
supplies, reportedly to be turned over to the children of Iraqi refugees<br>
currently in Iran. (Itar-Tass, December 6)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON TIMES: UKRAINE SELLING ARMS TO LIBYA. The Washington Times<br>
yesterday cited a "top-secret" Central Intelligence Agency report claiming<br>
that Ukraine had agreed to sell short-range ballistic missile to Libya and<br>
to service its Russian-made "Foxtrot" diesel-powered submarines. The<br>
missiles were identified as being either SS-21 or Scud-B missiles and were<br>
to bring the Ukrainians $500 million. They would be paid an additional $10<br>
million to maintain the submarines. <br>
<p>
The UN has embargoed all arms sales to Libya and, in addition, the missile<br>
transfer could violate Ukraine's pledge to abide by the terms of the Missile<br>
Technology Control Regime (MTCR). The report indicated that there would be<br>
no direct shipments between Ukraine and Libya but rather via Iran and Sudan.<br>
If confirmed, the transactions could threaten American aid to Ukraine. <br>
<p>
BELARUS OPPOSITION GETS ORGANIZED. In the course of the December 8<br>
pro-independence and democracy demonstration in Minsk (see Monitor, December<br>
9), Syamyon Sharetsky, chairman of the forcibly dissolved parliament,<br>
requested international support for the Belarusan opposition, "which resists<br>
a dictatorship in the heart of Europe." That opposition is now reorganizing<br>
after president Aleksandr Lukashenko's Russian-assisted imposition of a<br>
personal dictatorship. Minsk sources told The Monitor that the Belarusan<br>
Writers' Union hosted on December 4 a conference of opposition leaders,<br>
grouped as the Belarus Public in Defense of Democracy. Two days later a<br>
large group of members of the dissolved parliament met under Sharetsky's<br>
chairmanship. The participants adopted a statement drawing attention to<br>
"Russian ruling circles' contribution to establishing a dictatorial regime<br>
in Belarus." They resolved to continue meeting as lawful parliamentary<br>
deputies and to form a democratic and patriotic Belarus movement. They also<br>
urged Belarusan citizens to resist the Lukashenko regime through political<br>
activism, and called upon European nations to assist "the normal democratic<br>
development" of Belarus in their own -- as well as in Belarus' -- interest.<br>
<p>
The movement's founders include the dissolved parliament's vice-chairman and<br>
prominent entrepreneur Hennadz Karpenka, former parliament chairmen<br>
Mechislau Hryb and Stanislau Shushkevich, economic reformers and senior<br>
parliamentarians Stanislau Bahdankevich and Vasil Shlyndzikau, the dismissed<br>
Central Election Commission's chairman Viktar Hanchar, Popular Front leaders<br>
Yuri Khadyka and Lyavon Barshchevsky, Social-Democrat leader Mikalay<br>
Stankevich, and trade union representatives. The movement faces a virtual<br>
media blackout in Belarus. (Belaplan, December 5, 7; Monitor interviews)<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
GEORGIAN NAVY CHIEF DISMISSED. Rear Adm. Aleksandr Javakhishvili, the<br>
commander of the fledgling Georgian Navy, was fired on December 8, ending<br>
more than a month's confusion over his status. On November 6 Georgian<br>
sources reported that he had submitted his resignation, something official<br>
sources later denied. The 64-year-old admiral had been the only chief of<br>
independent Georgia's navy. Previously he had served in the Soviet Pacific<br>
Fleet as a submariner, rising to the rank of rear admiral. A Georgian<br>
Defense Ministry press statement said that his dismissal had been prompted<br>
by a letter of resignation and "the unhealthy situation" in the Poti naval<br>
brigade. (Interfax, December 9)<br>
<p>
Javakhishvili was known to have been unhappy serving under Defense Minister<br>
Vardiko Nadibaidze. He had even suggested that his small force be<br>
transferred to the Border Troops rather than remain as part of the military.<br>
Georgia's naval vessels recently replaced ships of the Russian Border Troops<br>
that were patrolling Georgian territorial waters. <br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
TURKMENISTAN-INDIAN OCEAN PIPELINE SUPPORTED BY TALIBAN. Pakistani officials<br>
announced yesterday that Taliban leaders have agreed with Pakistan's Foreign<br>
Secretary, Naimuddin Sheik, to support the projected pipeline that would<br>
bring Turkmen gas via Afghanistan and Pakistan to terminals on the Indian<br>
Ocean for export. They also agreed to upgrade the road which runs along the<br>
proposed pipeline route--a prerequisite for commencing the pipeline-laying<br>
work. Japan is among the potential importers of the gas. (Western agencies,<br>
Xinhua, December 9)<br>
<p>
Turkmenistan is ranked second or third worldwide with respect to natural gas<br>
reserves, but is unable to export it to international markets in meaningful<br>
quantities because of Russia's stranglehold on currently existing export<br>
pipelines. The pipeline consortium, comprised of the U.S. company UNOCAL and<br>
Saudi Arabia's Delta, have teamed up with Pakistan in seeking to provide an<br>
alternative, large-capacity export route for the Turkmen gas. The plan's<br>
prospects have substantially improved with the recent successes of the<br>
Taliban, who now control most of the projected pipeline's route. The<br>
Moscow-oriented leaders recently ousted from Kabul were distinctly cool to<br>
the project. <br>

GAIDAR CONDEMNS SEVASTOPOL VOTE AS ELECTIONEERING. Former prime minister<br>
Yegor Gaidar told Russian TV that last week's vote by the upper house of the<br>
Russian parliament, declaring the Crimean port of Sevastopol to be Russian<br>
territory, was dangerous because it threatened Ukrainian-Russian relations<br>
and ran counter to Russia's international commitments (specifically, the<br>
recognition of Ukraine's territorial integrity that Russia made when Russia<br>
joined the OSCE). Gaidar said Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov's initiation of the<br>
resolution was an opening salvo in the 2000 presidential race. (RTR,<br>
December 8. See item in Perspective section below)<br>
<p>
MORE OPPOSITION VICTORIES IN RUSSIAN REGIONAL ELECTIONS. Gubernatorial<br>
elections took place yesterday in ten Russian regions ranging from<br>
Khabarovsk in the far east to Arkhangelsk in the north. Preliminary results<br>
show Communist and nationalist candidates winning in Bryansk, Kurgan,<br>
Vladimir, and Voronezh oblasts, and leading in Ryazan oblast, where a<br>
Communist was also elected mayor of the provincial capital. The<br>
Kremlin-appointed incumbent is in the lead in Astrakhan oblast. (Itar-Tass,<br>
Reuters, AP, December 9)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN VOTERS NIX POWER PLANT. Some half million residents of Kostroma, 250<br>
miles northeast of Moscow, voted Sunday against the construction of a<br>
nuclear power plant in their rural region. The vote was unprecedented since<br>
all the candidates in the gubernatorial election held on the same day had<br>
promised to respect the voters' verdict. Until now, the Kremlin-appointed<br>
governor had supported the plant. Construction of the nuclear plant was<br>

CHERNOMYRDIN OUTLINES DEFENSE SPENDING PLANS. In an address to the Russian<br>
Duma on December 6, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said that defense<br>
production over the next four years would be concentrated in a limited<br>
number of enterprises and research centers. Chernomyrdin also said that<br>
defense spending priorities would gradually shift from maintaining<br>
personnel, which today gets the lion's share of the military budget, to<br>
defense procurement. Chernomyrdin was presenting the government's program<br>
for military reform from 1997-2000. (Itar-Tass, December 6)<br>
<p>
YELTSIN PLANS MEETINGS WITH WESTERN LEADERS. Boris Yeltsin's press spokesman<br>
announced on December 6 that German chancellor Helmut Kohl would travel to<br>
Moscow on January 4 for a brief round of talks with the recovering Russian<br>
president. A day later a spokesman for French president Jacques Chirac<br>
reported that the French leader would also visit with Yeltsin sometime in<br>
January. (Itar-Tass, December 6-7) Last week it was announced that Yeltsin<br>
and U.S. president Bill Clinton would meet in March. <br>
<p>
MOSCOW CONTINUES SUPPORT FOR BELGRADE. A senior Russian diplomat warned on<br>
December 5 that Russia would consider using its veto in the UN Security<br>
Council if the West pushes for a reimposition of sanctions on Belgrade. That<br>
same sentiment was echoed a day later when Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov<br>
repeated Russian accusations that the international community is biased<br>
against the Serbs. (Interfax, December 5; Itar-Tass, December 6) At the<br>
recent OSCE Summit in Lisbon Russia managed to scuttle inclusion in the<br>
Summit's final declaration of a critical assessment of the Serbian government.<br>
<p>
RUSSIANS ASKED TO MODERNIZE SYRIAN MIG-21S. The commander of the Syrian Air<br>
Force has requested that Russia modernize Syria's Russian-built MiG-21 jet<br>
fighters, according to Lt. Gen. Yuri Klishin, deputy commander of the<br>
Russian Air Force. Klishin met the Syrian officer last Friday at a weapons<br>
exposition in India. Syria is believed to have 180 MiG-21s. Klishin said<br>
Russia had also volunteered to update Syria's 90 Su-22 fighter-bombers.<br>

RUSSIANS CRY "FOUL" AFTER BAN ON COMPUTER SALES. An official of the Russian<br>
Atomic Energy Ministry has charged that the U.S. had pledged to supply his<br>
ministry with two supercomputers in return for Russia's signature on the<br>
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTB). The computers can simulate nuclear<br>
explosions and Moscow wants them to ensure the integrity of its nuclear<br>
weapons stockpile. In October the U.S. Department of Commerce rejected<br>
export of the computers. (Hindustan Times, December 5)<br>
<p>
BELARUSANS MARCH IN FIRST PROTEST SINCE LUKASHENKO'S COUP. Some 3,000 people<br>
rallied yesterday in central Minsk for democracy and national independence<br>
and against "dictatorship." The lawful parliament's chairman, Syamyon<br>
Sharetski, together with senior MPs and Popular Front leaders addressed the<br>
demonstrators, who also marched to the Russian embassy to protest against<br>
Moscow's official support for President Aleksandr Lukashenko. OMON units<br>
flanked the unauthorized demonstration. The protest leaders announced the<br>
formation of a committee to defend democracy and appealed for international<br>
support. (Belaplan, Western agencies, December 8-9)<br>

SIGNS OF APPREHENSION IN MOSCOW OVER NOMINATION OF ALBRIGHT, OTHERS. Moscow<br>
reacted warily over the weekend to the Clinton Administration's announcement<br>
that Madeleine Albright, currently U.S. ambassador to the UN, will be<br>
nominated for the post of Secretary of State. Although Russian foreign<br>
minister Yevgeny Primakov publicly described Albright as a "strong<br>
professional" and a "good partner for dialogue," foreign policy experts and<br>
commentators in Moscow suggested that the appointment could raise new<br>
tensions in an already strained bilateral relationship. Those commentators<br>
described Albright as more outspoken than outgoing U.S. secretary of state<br>
Warren Christopher, and observed that the Czech-born U.S. diplomat is, among<br>
other things, a vigorous proponent of NATO enlargement. Not surprisingly,<br>
Eastern European leaders were said to be especially pleased by the<br>
nomination, and Czech UN Ambassador Karel Kovanda was quoted as describing<br>
Albright as "a shimmering light in our diplomatic heaven." (Interfax,<br>
Reuter, AP, December 6) Moscow has harshly criticized the West for its plans<br>
to expand NATO and has maneuvered--thus far unsuccessfully--to acquire some<br>
sort of veto power over the inclusion of Eastern European and former Soviet<br>
states in the alliance. <br>
<p>
A December 7 commentary in a leading Russian daily was almost alarmist in<br>
its suggestion that the Clinton Administration's newly-named security team<br>
is dominated by anti-Russian hawks. (In addition to Albright, Clinton has<br>
nominated retiring Maine senator William Cohen for secretary of defense and<br>
National Security Advisor Anthony Lake for CIA head; Lake's assistant,<br>
Samuel Berger, will succeed his boss.) The commentary said that Russia's<br>
Foreign Ministry is unprepared to deal with Albright and intimated that the<br>
U.S. foreign policy team as a whole will endeavor to drive Russia to the<br>
"sidelines of international politics." (Segodnya, December 7) According to a<br>
U.S. daily, Albright will likely focus on managing the entry of Eastern<br>
European countries into NATO, while her deputy, Strobe Talbott, will attempt<br>
to prevent NATO enlargement from causing a rupture in relations with Russia.<br>
(The Washington Post, December 8)<br>
<p>
MINI-DEMO MOURNS SOVIET COLLAPSE. A crowd of barely 150 mostly elderly<br>
people gathered in Moscow December 8 to mark the fifth anniversary of the<br>
Belovezh accords that dissolved the USSR in 1991. No major opposition<br>
leaders attended and the small size of the crowd was seen as an indication<br>
that, even if some strata of Russian society mourn the passing of the USSR,<br>
even radical Communists recognize that resurrecting the old Union is<br>
impossible. (Reuters, December 8) President Yeltsin marked the anniversary<br>
by giving interviews to the Interfax news agency and the newspaper Trud in<br>
which he asserted that the Soviet Union had already collapsed before he and<br>
the presidents of Ukraine and Belarus signed the Belovezh documents. The<br>
establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States had been the only<br>
way to ensure that the collapse proceeded peacefully, Yeltsin said.<br>

<p>
CHECHNYA: NINETEEN HATS IN THE RING. Nominations for presidential candidates<br>
in Chechnya closed at midnight on December 7. Each candidate now has until<br>
December 27 to submit a minimum of 10,000 signatures to the Central Election<br>
Commission. Chechen prime minister Aslan Maskhadov and First Deputy Premier<br>
Movladi Udugov have both officially confirmed their intention to run. (RTR,<br>
RIA-Novosti, December 7) Just hours before the deadline, incumbent Chechen<br>
president Zelimkhan Yandarbiev also registered. (ORT, December 8) Earlier,<br>
Shamil Basaev and presidential national security assistant Akhmed Zakaev<br>
submitted their documentation. There are 19 registered candidates in all.<br>
(RTR, December 8) So far, Maskhadov's supporters have collected the most<br>
signatures on behalf of their candidate--50,000 instead of the required<br>
10,000. (Interfax, December 6)<br>
<p>
The election is turning into a two-horse race between Maskhadov and<br>
Yandarbiev. Although Basaev -- the field commander who led the<br>
hostage-taking raid on Budennovsk in June 1985 -- is popular with a<br>
significant part of the population, it is unlikely to be enough to propel<br>
him to victory. "Basaev is a wonderful field commander, our national hero,<br>
but he's not a politician and can't be our president," was the opinion<br>
frequently expressed to Monitor's correspondent in Chechnya last week.<br>
<p>
MOSCOW WOULD PREFER A MASKHADOV VICTORY. Speaking to journalists last week,<br>
Russian Security Council secretary Ivan Rybkin refused to support any of<br>
Chechnya's presidential candidates, saying that the elections are Chechnya's<br>
internal affair. Rybkin did, however, concede that Moscow is far from<br>
indifferent to the outcome. (Nezavisimaya gazeta, December 7) It is clear<br>
that, moreover, that of the two leading candidates Moscow would much prefer<br>
Maskhadov. "The separatist leaders fall into two main groups: the moderates,<br>
with whom one can and must negotiate, and the radicals, who will not listen<br>
to any arguments. Aslan Maskhadov has proven himself a moderate, reasonable<br>
politician," Vladimir Zorin, chairman of the State Duma's committee on<br>
international relations, told Monitor. (Zorin met with Maskhadov several<br>
times during negotiations in the summers of 1995 and 1996.) In Moscow's<br>
opinion, Chechen president Zelimkhan Yandarbiev belongs to the radical<br>
faction. Yandarbiev is the main force behind the creation of a strict<br>
Islamic state in Chechnya and has the tacit support of the Chechen clergy.<br>
(See Monitor, December 5)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN MINERS' STRIKE ENTERING SECOND WEEK. The nationwide strike by<br>
Russian coalminers enters its second week today. Thousands of miners remain<br>
on strike despite last week's promise by President Yeltsin that he will<br>
ensure back wages are paid as soon as he returns to work. Managers of the<br>
Russian coal company Rosugol said on December 6 that the number of strikers<br>
was falling and that they expected the strike to end soon, but miners'<br>
leaders seem to be awaiting the outcome of tomorrow's visit to the Kuzbass<br>
by First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Potanin. (Interfax, December 8)<br>
Meanwhile, Russia's umbrella labor organization, the Federation of<br>
Independent Trade Unions, held its third congress in Moscow over the<br>
weekend. Union leaders said they would give the government until the end of<br>
the year to pay wage arrears. If it does not do so, they will call a general<br>
strike. But federation leader Mikhail Shmakov said it would take 2-3 months<br>
to prepare for a general strike, which gives the government a welcome<br>
breathing space. (AP, December 8) There were unconfirmed reports this<br>
morning that miners in the Kuzbass have started to return to work.<br>
(Itar-Tass, December 9)<br>
<p>
RUSSIA DRAGGING ITS HEELS IN PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE. According to a NATO<br>
military spokesman, Russian participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace<br>
(PfP) program has virtually ground to a halt. Russia was among the last<br>
countries to sign the program's Framework Document--waiting until some five<br>
months after it was open for signature in January 1994. Moscow then waited<br>
another year before agreeing to its individual country cooperation program.<br>
That document, approved by former foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev in May<br>
1995, has "become obsolete," according to the NATO official, and Russia has<br>
not shown any interest in updating it. (Interfax, December 8)<br>
<p>
The Partnership for Peace continues to attract other European countries who<br>
have no interest in ultimately joining NATO. Swiss minister of foreign<br>
affairs Flavio Cotti will sign the Framework Document in Brussels on<br>
December 11. Switzerland will then join such other neutral countries as<br>
Austria, Finland, and Sweden in the PfP. <br>
<p>
The NATO official said that Russia's reluctance to participate in the PfP<br>
was keeping it "on the sidelines" of the effort to create a new European<br>
security architecture. He noted that the Russian military was experiencing<br>
severe financial problems but indicated that NATO would be willing to pay<br>
some of the costs for Russian participation in PfP events. Russia is<br>
providing an airborne brigade to the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) in<br>
Bosnia -- which is not connected with the PfP -- and has indicated it will<br>
be represented in the follow-on Stabilization Force. <br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
UKRAINE PREPARES RESPONSE TO RUSSIAN CLAIM TO SEVASTOPOL. Top Ukrainian<br>
government officials stated in unison over the weekend that Kiev will react<br>
calmly but resolutely to Moscow's claim to Sevastopol (see Monitor, December<br>
6), and will seek to continue Ukrainian-Russian negotiations on other<br>
issues. The Ukrainian parliament on December 6 adopted overwhelmingly a<br>
resolution protesting the "territorial claim and violation of Ukrainian<br>
sovereignty" and introducing for floor debate an already prepared draft law<br>
that would set a deadline for the withdrawal from Ukraine of the<br>
Russian-controlled bulk of the Black Sea Fleet. (Interfax-Ukraine, UNIAN,<br>
December 6-8)<br>
<p>
AGREEMENT REACHED ON GAS SUPPLIES TO UKRAINE. According to an agreement<br>
signed on December 4, Russia's Gazprom will deliver to Ukraine 53 billion<br>
cubic meters of gas next year at a price of $80 per 1000 cubic meters. The<br>
agreement also determined the conditions under which Russian gas will<br>
transit Ukrainian territory to Europe. In 1997 such deliveries will amount<br>
to 120 billion cubic meters. The diversification of its energy suppliers,<br>
reducing dependence on Russia, is a central concern for Ukrainian leaders.<br>
Reporting on the results of a meeting last week with Uzbek president Islam<br>
Karimov, Ukrainian prime minister Pavel Lazarenko declared on December 6<br>
that gas from Uzbekistan might serve as a useful alternative to supplies<br>
from Russia. Deliveries of gas from Uzbekistan will amount to 6 billion<br>
cubic meters in 1997. The agreement with Gazprom guarantees transport of<br>
Uzbek gas and of 19 billion cubic meters from Turkmenistan. It is expected<br>
that the role of Uzbekistan as a gas supplier to Ukraine will be increased<br>
when an agreement is reached resolving outstanding Ukrainian debts to<br>
Uzbekistan for past deliveries. (Interfax, December 6)<br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
KAZAKHSTAN'S LEFTISTS PROTEST AGAINST REFORMS. A coalition of political<br>
opposition and trade union groups staged a 3,000-strong rally and procession<br>
in central Almaty yesterday to protest economic conditions. Speakers and<br>
marchers urged the government to recognize the social costs of economic<br>
reform and to reorient policy "in favor of the majority of the populace."<br>
They also accused the authorities of corruption and "betrayal of the<br>
people's interests," and called for the resignation of the government and<br>
for new parliamentary elections to create a government of national trust.<br>
Participants were divided on the issue of calling for President Nursultan<br>
Nazarbayev's resignation and for a campaign of civil disobedience.<br>
(Interfax, Itar-Tass, December 8)<br>
<p>
The rally, which was authorized, was the latest in a recent series of mostly<br>
unauthorized actions organized by a leftist and left-of-center coalition of<br>
political and trade unions groups. They include the Azamat movement, the<br>
Communist Party of Kazakhstan, the Independent Trade Unions' Confederation,<br>
and other groups, mostly cutting across ethnic lines. The authorities have<br>
warned several of the leaders of these groups that they may be prosecuted<br>
for violations of public order.<br>
<p>
TAJIK GOVERNMENT LAUNCHES OFFENSIVE INTO OPPOSITION-HELD REGION. Tajik army,<br>
internal affairs, state security, and presidential guard troops launched an<br>
offensive into central Tajikistan over the weekend, recapturing the district<br>
center Komsomolabad and advancing eastward toward opposition-held Garm.<br>
However, the opposition retook Tavildara and pressured two passes that lead<br>
into southwestern Tajikistan's Hotlon region, home to the Russian-backed<br>
ruling Kulob clan. Russian "peacekeeping" troops moved into position to<br>
defend one of the passes under the pretext of protecting a Russian air<br>
defense installation.<br>
<p>
The Tajik foreign ministry expressed regret to the UN mission after<br>
government troops forcibly turned back and manhandled a group of UN military<br>
observers en route to the combat zone. However, the ministry demanded that<br>
it be prenotified of the observers' movements. Government troops have<br>
repeatedly and openly prevented the military observer mission (UNMOT) from<br>
fulfilling its mandate. Often passive in such situations, UNMOT was<br>
instructed in this case from UN headquarters in New York to recall all of<br>
its members from all field locations to Dushanbe for security reasons.<br>
(Interfax, Itar-Tass, Voice of Free Tajikistan, December 6 through 8)<br>
<p>
Tajik authorities may have provoked the incident, as on several previous<br>
occasions, in order to blind the UN to the use of Russian aviation in<br>
combat. The outcome of the ongoing battle for central Tajikistan will<br>
probably determine the front lines and the balance of power at least until<br>
after the spring thaw. President Imomali Rahmonov and opposition leader<br>
Saidabdullo Nuri are scheduled to meet in northern Afghanistan on December 9<br>
at Russian and UN insistence in order to prepare a formal armistice-signing<br>
meeting in Moscow. An immediate armistice would enable the opposition to<br>
keep most of its substantial recent gains. <br>

THE FORTNIGHT IN REVIEW<br>
<p>
	Despite a political scandal that rocked the Kremlin and a brouhaha over the<br>
firing of a top military commander, President Boris Yeltsin's swift recovery<br>
from heart surgery this past fortnight seemed set to right Russia's listing<br>
ship of state and to end, for the time being at least, talk of a lame duck<br>
presidency. Yeltsin's restored presence appeared also to be manifested in a<br>
decision to withdraw the last of the federal troops from Chechnya, where<br>
plans for a presidential election are proceeding apace, and the Kremlin was<br>
further buoyed by the unexpectedly successful debut of a Russian Eurobond<br>
issue. U.S.-Russian relations, meanwhile, survived yet another spy scandal,<br>
but Moscow found itself largely isolated at an OSCE Summit in Lisbon.<br>
Finally, the defeat of incumbent Mircea Snegur in Moldova's December 1<br>
presidential election marked a welcome exception to the general trend of<br>
authoritarianism that has been evident throughout parts of the former Soviet<br>
Union. <br>
<p>
YELTSIN -- BACK IN THE SADDLE<br>
	Boris Yeltsin's transfer to a sanitarium near Moscow on November 22<br>
appeared to change the balance of power in the Kremlin. Clearly back in<br>
charge, the president shed the "lame duck" label and critics stopped making<br>
snide references to the "regency" of presidential aide Anatoly Chubais. But<br>
all was not smooth sailing for Russia's leaders. On November 15, as Yeltsin<br>
prepared to leave the hospital, a Moscow newspaper published the transcript<br>
of an incriminating conversation in which Chubais and two other Yeltsin<br>
aides allegedly discussed ways of hushing up covert funding for Yeltsin's<br>
election campaign. Publication seemed timed to embarrass Yeltsin and<br>
discredit Chubais, whose energies are focused on building an efficient<br>
mechanism of presidential power. Chubais denied the conversation had ever<br>
taken place and Yeltsin's confidence in his chief of staff appeared<br>
unshaken. At the same time, however, Yeltsin made a number of moves<br>
apparently intended to boost the status of one of Chubais' fiercest rivals,<br>
Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov. The most striking of these was to invite Luzhkov<br>
-- apparently as a counterweight to Chubais -- to attend the first meeting<br>
of a new consultative body of Russia's top decision-makers. <br>
<p>
MENDING FENCES WITH CHECHNYA<br>
	Another sign of Yeltsin's waxing authority came on November 23, when the<br>
president signed a controversial decree ordering the last two brigades of<br>
federal troops still in Chechnya to withdraw before January 27, the date set<br>
for presidential and parliamentary elections in the republic. Withdrawal was<br>
supported by army chiefs but strongly opposed by Interior Minister Anatoly<br>
Kulikov. Later the same day, the Russian and Chechen prime ministers met to<br>
sign an interim agreement covering topics of economic importance such as the<br>
resumption of oil and gas deliveries between Chechnya and Russia. A more<br>
detailed agreement between the two governments is due to be signed after the<br>
January elections.<br>
	Communists and nationalists in the Russian Duma denounced both the<br>
withdrawal and the interim agreement. Their threats to impeach the president<br>
and vote no confidence in the government came to nothing, however. Deputies<br>
lost their nerve when Yeltsin made it clear that, if they carried out their<br>
threats, he would dissolve parliament. Instead, the Duma on November 29<br>
merely urged Yeltsin to "reconsider" his decisions. Yeltsin ignored the<br>
Duma's appeal. On December 1, the troop withdrawal from Chechnya began.<br>
Opinion polls indicated that the Russian public strongly supported the move.<br>
<p>
CHECHEN ELECTION CAMPAIGN UNDER WAY<br>
	Five candidates declared their intention to run for president of Chechnya,<br>
but the only serious contenders appeared to be incumbent president Zelimkhan<br>
Yandarbiev and Prime Minister Aslan Maskhadov. Earlier, Yandarbiev had said<br>
that the Chechen resistance forces had decided to unite behind him in order<br>
to avoid splitting their ranks. But Maskhadov told Chechen television on<br>
November 25 that "an election with only one candidate is not an election."<br>
Yandarbiev supports a harder line in relations with Moscow than Maskhadov<br>
and was the main initiator within the Chechen leadership of the creation of<br>
a strict Islamic state in Chechnya. From all indications, Yandarbiev's<br>
candidacy is supported by Chechnya's Islamic clergy, while Moscow clearly<br>
hopes that Maskhadov, a former colonel in the Soviet Army, will emerge<br>
victorious. Though seen by Moscow as a moderate, Maskhadov enjoys enormous<br>
popularity inside Chechnya, where he is given much of the credit for the<br>
victory over the Russian army. <br>
<p>
RUSSIA'S DEBUT EUROBOND ISSUE: HEAVILY OVERSUBSCRIBED<br>
	On the financial front, the Russian government raised $1 billion on<br>
November 21 when it made its first international bond issue since the 1917<br>
Revolution. This was double the amount the government originally planned to<br>
raise. At 9.25 percent, yield was about a third higher than for the<br>
equivalent U.S. government bonds, reflecting higher perceived risk, but keen<br>
western interest in the issue was seen as a sign of confidence that Russia's<br>
long-awaited economic turnaround will soon begin. Optimism surged with<br>
Yeltsin's strong recovery from surgery and investors submitted bids in<br>
excess of $2 billion.<br>
	In another sign of confidence, the Russian government announced an annual<br>
range for the ruble against the dollar. Until now, Moscow had confined<br>
itself to setting six-monthly targets. The ruble will start 1997 within a<br>
range of 5,500-6,100 rubles to the dollar, and will gradually decline to<br>
5,750-6,350 rubles by the end of the year.<br>
<p>
CONFUSION IN THE DEFENSE MINISTRY<br>
	But the good news elsewhere did not extend to the Defense Ministry, which<br>
created yet another embarrassing personnel muddle on December 2 when it<br>
announced that Ground Forces commander-in-chief Vladimir Semenov had been<br>
dismissed for actions dishonoring his uniform. The popular Semenov protested<br>
the allegations contained in the dismissal order, and the controversy<br>
deepened as neither the Defense Ministry, the Russian General Prosecutor's<br>
Office, nor the Interior Ministry could shed any light on what the charges<br>
against Semenov might be. Meanwhile, the Russian president's office<br>
announced publicly that Boris Yeltsin had approved the dismissal of Semenov<br>
in principal only, and that the decision still had to be considered by a<br>
presidential commission that oversees high level military appointments.<br>
Defense Minister Igor Rodionov, already taking some heat for the halting<br>
pace of Russian military reform, had apparently exceeded his authority in<br>
announcing Semenov's sacking. The conflict presented a picture of confusion<br>
at the top of the military hierarchy and, Defense Ministry denials<br>
notwithstanding, appeared to be the cause of a last-minute decision by<br>
Rodionov to postpone an important official visit to the U.S.<br>
<p>
FOREIGN POLICY: THE SPIES AMONG US<br>
	For Russia and the U.S., the fortnight began with the conclusion of one spy<br>
scandal and the uncovering of another, neither of which redounded to the<br>
glory of the American intelligence community. The episode that came to a<br>
close involved Vladimir Galkin, a former mid-level Soviet KGB agent, who<br>
returned to Russia a hero on November 17 following a U.S. Justice Department<br>
decision to drop espionage charges against him. But Galkin had scarcely<br>
gotten settled back in Moscow when, on November 18, U.S. authorities charged<br>
Harold Nicholson, a former CIA station chief, with spying for Moscow.<br>
Nicholson is believed to have been recruited by the Kremlin during a 1994<br>
trip to Malaysia, and U.S. intelligence personnel were said to have been<br>
stunned by the possibility that he had launched his espionage activities<br>
less than eight weeks after the conviction of Aldrich Ames, the most<br>
notorious spy in CIA history. Unlike Ames, moreover, Nicholson was seen as a<br>
rising star with excellent prospects to ascend to a leadership position in<br>
the agency's hierarchy. <br>
	Nicholson, who on November 27 pled innocent to the spying charges, is the<br>
highest-ranking CIA employee ever to be charged with espionage. He allegedly<br>
received more than $180,000 from Moscow, and, although not believed to have<br>
been as serious a security breach as Ames, is thought to have turned over to<br>
the Kremlin a wealth of secret materials, including the identities of<br>
undercover CIA operatives and details of the agency's activities around the<br>
world. Ironically, an FBI affidavit submitted for the case suggested that<br>
the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service may have inadvertently provided one<br>
of the clues that led to Nicholson's arrest.<br>
<p>
THE LONELY ROAD TO LISBON<br>
	Despite a nearly two month period during which Moscow had emitted mixed<br>
signals on the issue of NATO enlargement, the country's political elites<br>
closed ranks in opposition to the alliance's expansion plans in the days<br>
leading up the December 2-3 OSCE Summit in Lisbon. Boris Yeltsin punctuated<br>
Moscow's new-found solidarity when he took a hard line on the issue during<br>
talks on November 29 with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Foreign<br>
Minister Yevgeny Primakov. In a restatement of Moscow's long-held position<br>
on the issue, Yeltsin also urged the Summit participants to work toward the<br>
construction of a new European security system in which the OSCE rather than<br>
NATO would play the central role. <br>
	As was the case at the OSCE's 1994 Summit in Budapest, however, Russia's<br>
efforts toward this end won little backing. In addition, Moscow's support<br>
for the increasingly authoritarian president of Belarus, Aleksandr<br>
Lukashenko, and for his besieged counterpart in Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic,<br>
left the Russian delegation isolated. For all of that, Moscow was successful<br>
in some of the lesser skirmishing that took place in Lisbon. In the Summit's<br>
declaration on a 21st century European security model, for example, Russia<br>
won inclusion of a passage saying that OSCE member states "will not<br>
strengthen their security at the expense of the security of other states." A<br>
Summit document on arms control carried a similar declaration. But Russia's<br>
most significant victory may have been an agreement to review the 1990 CFE<br>
Treaty, which the Kremlin argues has long since been overtaken by<br>
geopolitical changes in Europe. Moscow would like to alter the treaty's bloc<br>
approach to weapons' ceilings and will undoubtedly try to win a relaxation<br>
of restrictions placed on the deployment of Russian arms in the Leningrad<br>
and North Caucasus military districts. <br>
<p>
AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENTS IN THE CIS: MOLDOVA BUCKS THE TREND<br>
	With Petru Lucinschi's victory over incumbent Mircea Snegur in the December<br>
1 presidential election, Moldova becomes a refreshing exception to the trend<br>
toward establishment of authoritarian presidencies in most CIS countries.<br>
Pioneered by Russia's Boris Yeltsin, and emulated most recently by the<br>
Belarusan and Armenian presidents in forms tailored to local circumstances,<br>
the model sorely tempted Snegur. The failure of his bid for reelection and<br>
personal rule signifies first and foremost the failure of that model in<br>
Moldova. The outcome, uncertain till the last moment, is to be welcomed not<br>
only on purely democratic considerations -- which are more than sufficient<br>
in themselves -- but also on pragmatic grounds. The national<br>
authoritarianism that Snegur and his latter-day allies strove to introduce<br>
could have compromised the efforts to solve the country's problems, with<br>
potential reverberations far beyond Moldova's borders. <br>
	The magnitude and complexity of those problems belie the country's small<br>
size and relative obscurity. Situated along a geopolitical fault line, and<br>
at a traditional crossroads of competing great-power interests, Moldova<br>
became the first target of unprovoked Russian military aggression and<br>
"peacemaking" in the post-Soviet period; and it is the sole European country<br>
in which Russia continues to station troops against the country's will. Its<br>
multiethnic population includes compactly settled minorities whose watchful<br>
mother countries are Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, and Bulgaria. Moscow seeks to<br>
restore some form of control over Moldova, while neighboring Romania<br>
ultimately hopes to incorporate Moldova outright. Formerly producing up to<br>
one third of the ex-USSR's marketable output of certain foodstuffs, Moldova<br>
has an immense but currently wasted agricultural export potential, whose<br>
revival requires intensive farming. On the plus side, Moldova boasts a rare<br>
degree of tension-free interethnic coexistence -- including a<br>
precedent-setting case of ethnic-territorial autonomy -- owing to tolerant<br>
official and popular attitudes. (The Transdniester conflict is not seen as<br>
interethnic by either participants or observers). Politically, that<br>
interethnic tranquillity is predicated on Moldova's independence from both<br>
Russia and Romania.<br>
<p>
SNEGUR: A CAMPAIGN TO DIVIDE<br>
	Snegur's reelection strategy entailed concessions in both of those<br>
directions, hoping for support or at least benign acceptance of his bid for<br>
a presidential regime, at the cost of concessions potentially fatal to<br>
Moldova's independence. Since embarking on his campaign, as far back as<br>
early 1995, the president ceased any serious effort at obtaining the<br>
withdrawal of Russian troops from Moldova; signed a protocol with Russia on<br>
mutual military assistance against unspecified foreign aggression; and<br>
tranquilized potential Western supporters with assurances that Boris Yeltsin<br>
was going to withdraw the troops and help settle the Transdniester conflict<br>
equitably. Internally, in a high-risk gamble, Snegur allied himself with<br>
pro-Romanian forces, particularly the Popular Front, and endorsed some of<br>
their agenda, at the same time flirting with national-Communist holdovers in<br>
Romania itself. The dynamic and dedicated Front leaders -- proving far more<br>
effective than most of the president's old guard -- ended up devising<br>
Snegur's campaign strategy, dominating his staff, writing his speeches, and<br>
setting the tone of the presidential press.<br>
	Snegur needed the Front because his newly-created personal party was slow<br>
to catch on. Named Party of Rebirth and Conciliation, and openly<br>
dedicated--along with a would-be coalition named the "Pro-Snegur Movement"<br>
-- to advance the president's fortunes, the party and Snegur himself adopted<br>
a strategy of political polarization, not conciliation. Their discourse<br>
turned highly inflammatory and openly sought to intimidate. The president<br>
routinely labeled his competitors and their supporters, including the<br>
parliamentary majority, traitors to the nation and enemies of the people;<br>
adopted the tactic of abusing specific politicians by name in his public<br>
speeches; called for the establishment of presidential rule in place of the<br>
constitution in force, which  Snegur himself had promulgated in 1994; and<br>
warned that he would "turn to the people" in a referendum to dissolve the<br>
parliament, although the constitution does not entitle the president to take<br>
any such steps.<br>
	Snegur also acted unconstitutionally in unilaterally dismissing Defense<br>
Minister Pavel Creanga when the latter refused to guarantee the military's<br>
support for Snegur's reelection. The Constitutional Court ruled the<br>
dismissal unconstitutional and reinstated the minister, but the president<br>
unlawfully declared himself in "direct command" of the army and personally<br>
took over the minister's main functions. In another disconcerting move,<br>
which defied a parliamentary vote, the president took over control of the<br>
security service for the protection of state officials, expanded it,<br>
entrusted it to the brother of the presidential party's and presidential<br>
campaign's chief, and declined to account to parliament for the financing<br>
and activities of that service.<br>
	Perhaps the central, and surely the most productive track in Snegur's<br>
reelection campaign, was his attack on the government and parliament over<br>
economic reforms. This undoubtedly accounts for a large part of Snegur's 39<br>
percent of the vote in the first round and 46 percent in the second. Snegur<br>
scuttled the pro-reform consensus that had previously united him, Lucinschi,<br>
and Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli. The president conducted a populist<br>
campaign decrying the social costs of the reforms, encouraging inflationary<br>
demands on the state budget from labor unions and professional groups, and<br>
bombarding the parliament and government with presidential messages<br>
demanding immediate disbursement of benefits and entitlements from an empty<br>
treasury. The president succeeded in pinning on Sangheli, his most feared<br>
competitor, the blame for the social costs of the reforms. It proved to be<br>
the decisive factor in holding Sangheli to only 10 percent of the vote in<br>
the first round and eliminating him from the race. But the atmosphere Snegur<br>
created through his electoral tactics may complicate his successor's task in<br>
carrying out the next stage of the reforms after the election.<br>
	It is commonplace in Moldova to observe that the boycott by Transdniester<br>
leaders of the election substantially helped Snegur because of his<br>
unpopularity in that region. As he undoubtedly realized, his reelection<br>
prospects would probably have been close to nil from the outset, had<br>
Transdniester's electorate  (41 percent Moldovan, 28 percent Ukrainian, 25<br>
percent Russian) been given an opportunity to participate in the balloting.<br>
A further commonplace observation in Chisinau is that Snegur's victory would<br>
have suited Tiraspol by relieving pressure on it to renounce secession.<br>
Snegur is widely thought to have been less than eager to bring back to the<br>
fold a region that would vote massively against him. <br>
<p>
DEMAGOGUERY UNDONE<br>
	Snegur's volte-face and the manner of his defeat bring a disappointing end<br>
to a once-promising presidency. His service includes almost eight<br>
consecutive years as Moldova's highest elected official: head of the<br>
legislature (1989-1990), president of the republic elected by the parliament<br>
(1990-91), and popularly elected president (December 1991-January 1997).<br>
Snegur contributed substantially to the national movement in the final years<br>
of Soviet rule, bravely resisted the August 1991 Soviet putsch, launched the<br>
state-building process and economic reforms in the newly independent<br>
country, and actively cultivated relations with the West. He also displayed<br>
weaknesses and made mistakes, mostly born of inexperience and provincial<br>
isolation, and correctable in time. Yet the last two years have witnessed a<br>
steady decline in his performance, a growing ambition to prolong his rule at<br>
almost any price, and an all-consuming concentration on intra-elite<br>
political conflict to the detriment of the affairs of state.<br>
	A presidential bid for personal rule may have succeeded almost by default<br>
several years ago, but by 1996 Moldovan society had evolved enough elite<br>
groups sufficiently self-confident to block the attempt. State officials who<br>
may easily have collaborated or gone along with a presidential fiat were now<br>
more difficult to find. The defense minister, the Constitutional Court, the<br>
Cabinet of ministers, the governing Agrarian-Democratic party, and the<br>
parliamentary leadership stood their ground with the constitution and the<br>
law in hand. <br>
	The strategy of intimidation proved less effective than might have been<br>
expected from a population conditioned from Soviet days to obey and vote for<br>
the number one leader and to fear reprisals for the slightest disobedience.<br>
The electorate preferred Lucinschi's more modern message, "European" image,<br>
and emphasis on the need to divide and distribute political power. His<br>
victory, fairly narrow though it is, reflects a slow maturation of Moldova's<br>
society and a break with the Soviet-era mystique of power, monolithism, and<br>
"vozhdism." It ultimately suggests that presidential regimes may not<br>
necessarily be the wave of the future in the ex-Soviet space. <br>

RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT PROMISES (AGAIN) TO PAY MINERS. Russian finance minister<br>
Aleksandr Livshits has signed a time-table for repaying wage arrears in the<br>
coal industry. First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Potanin will be<br>
dispatched next week to the major striking coal basin, the Kuzbass, to try<br>
to resolve the situation there. The upper house of the Russian parliament<br>
decided yesterday to hold an extraordinary session on December 10 to hear a<br>
report by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on what the government is doing<br>
to pay wage and pension arrears. (Itar-Tass, December 5) <br>
<p>
CHECHEN REFUGEES TO TAKE PART IN ELECTION. Russian Security Council<br>
secretary Ivan Rybkin met yesterday with Momadi Saidaev, chairman of the<br>
Central Election Commission preparing for the presidential and parliamentary<br>
elections to be held in the Chechen republic on January 27. Rybkin said that<br>
he and Saidaev had agreed on the participation in the elections of some<br>
400,000 residents who had fled the fighting and are now living outside the<br>
republic. Polling stations will be set up in Moscow, Stavropol,<br>
Rostov-on-Don and other Russian cities, and also in Kazakhstan and Ukraine.<br>
(Itar-Tass, December 5) <br>
<p>
CLINTON, YELTSIN MEETING CONFIRMED. The White House confirmed yesterday that<br>
Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin will meet in March. No exact date<br>
has been set. Although it is Washington's turn to host the talks, U.S.<br>
officials indicated that, in view of Yeltsin's health, the meeting could<br>
take place in a third country near to Russia, or in Moscow itself. Earlier<br>
yesterday Clinton and Yeltsin spoke by phone, their first conversation since<br>
Yeltsin's heart surgery last month. (Reuter, December 5)<br>
<p>
POWER MINISTRIES TO COORDINATE PR. Russia's Defense Ministry hosted press<br>
service representatives from the various "power ministries" on December 5 at<br>
a meeting -- the first of its kind -- devoted to improving the coordination<br>
of information disseminated to the public. The provision of often<br>
conflicting information during Russia's war in Chechnya, which was a public<br>
relations disaster for the ministries involved, was described as a primary<br>
motivation for the get-together. (Itar-Tass, December 4; Nezavisimaya<br>
gazeta, December 5)<br>
<p>
ADMIRAL: PACIFIC FLEET AS SMALL AS IT CAN GET. The commander-in-chief of the<br>
Russian Pacific Fleet, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, said yesterday that the<br>
fleet could not be reduced below its current level. Kuroyedov complained<br>
that over the past 4 years the fleet had shrunk from 335 to 140 ships, with<br>
commensurate cuts in personnel. (Interfax-Eurasia, December 5)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN MOTHERS WIN ALTERNATIVE NOBEL PRIZE. The Soldiers' Mothers Committee<br>
of Russia yesterday was named as the winner of an alternative Nobel Prize in<br>
Stockholm. The award, worth $250,000, will be presented on December 9. The<br>
committee was honored for defending soldiers' rights in the Russian military<br>
and for its efforts to end the war in Chechnya. (Itar-Tass, December 5) <br>
<p>
MOSCOW UPBRAIDS NORWAY OVER ASYLUM SEEKERS. Russia's Foreign Ministry<br>
yesterday criticized authorities in Oslo for repeatedly refusing to provide<br>
Moscow with information on eight Russians who have sought asylum in Norway.<br>
A ministry spokesman described the situation as "abnormal" and suggested<br>
that Oslo's silence was inconsistent with "good-neighborly relations"<br>
between the two countries. (Itar-Tass, December 5) The eight asylum seekers<br>
-- seven men and one woman -- reportedly crossed into Norway by bus on<br>
November 8 at a border post near Kirkenes. (Itar-Tass, November 13)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
RUSSIA'S BUDGET: BACK TO THE FOUR-YEAR PLAN? When Russian prime minister<br>
Viktor Chernomyrdin presents the draft 1997 federal budget to the Duma<br>
today, he will also outline a four-year development program. The details<br>
already released of that plan suggest that it is overly optimistic: when<br>
approved by the government on November 21 it contained a maximum average<br>
annual inflation rate of eight percent and a projection of GDP growth at<br>
five percent a year. (Itar-Tass, November 21) Economics Minister Yevgenii<br>
Yasin subsequently sent a confidential letter to the prime minister in which<br>
he criticized the draft as too ambitious. This letter was leaked to the<br>
press. (Nezavisimaya gazeta, November 26) Yasin also said that efforts to<br>
contain the budget deficit by extracting more tax revenue would lead only to<br>
a further collapse of output. The tax collection problem is not, Yasin<br>
argued, primarily one of willful tax evasion, but stems from a shrinking tax<br>
base. He departed from his usual IMF-compatible stance to recommend more<br>
state support for ailing industries. <br>
<p>
Economists agree that the positive trends envisaged in the original<br>
1997-2000 program were exaggerated. In fact, Russian GDP, as officially<br>
measured, has been falling for seven years and is expected to show a decline<br>
of about five percent this year. Inflation in 1996 will be about 22 percent.<br>
(Segodnya, November 29) The aim of encouraging investment by getting<br>
interest rates down to 20 percent in the course of next year is, in Yasin's<br>
view, also overly ambitious. The Economics Ministry considers zero growth in<br>
1997 and a beginning of recovery only in 1998 to be the more likely<br>
scenario. It appears that Yasin's doubts have caused at least some<br>
redrafting of the original program. The projected annual inflation rate for<br>
1997-2000 has now set at 10 percent instead of 8 percent. (Itar-Tass,<br>
December 5) In general, the government's program contains a good deal that<br>
is sensible but also a dollop of wishful thinking worthy of a Soviet<br>
five-year plan. <br>
<p>
REGIONAL BOSSES SEEK SOFT MONEY. New arrangements are being established for<br>
consultation and cooperation between the federal government in Moscow and<br>
the leaders of Russia's regions. On December 3, First Deputy Prime Minister<br>
Aleksei Bolshakov met with representatives of the seven interregional<br>
associations that group together almost all of Russia's 89 federal subjects<br>
(Siberian Agreement, Great Volga, etc.). The agenda seems to have been<br>
overwhelmingly economic. (Itar-Tass, December 2-3) It was agreed to conduct<br>
three cycles of regular federal/regional consultations. Every quarter, Prime<br>
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will meet with representatives of the regional<br>
leaderships. Once a month, there will be a meeting of a working group<br>
co-chaired by Bolshakov and Konstantin Titov (who was reelected as governor<br>
of Samara on December 1). One of Chernomyrdin's deputies will also meet<br>
monthly with the leaders of a specific region. <br>
<p>
These new arrangement make sense politically but may be dangerous for<br>
economic policy. Politically, the regions are flexing their muscles as<br>
gubernatorial elections throughout the country confer popular legitimacy on<br>
regional bosses who previously were appointed by the president. Both the<br>
federal government and the regional leaders need to devise some framework<br>
within which to tackle common problems. The economic danger is that the<br>
regional leaders, by and large, want the federal government to provide more<br>
subsidies and import protection for Russian producers. These new pressures<br>
to relax financial discipline come at a time when the 1997 budget has still<br>
not been approved, and when calls for a more interventionist industrial<br>
policy are coming from all sides, even from the hitherto reform-minded<br>
economics minister, Yevgenii Yasin (see above).<br>
<p>
FOREIGN INVESTORS SHOW LITTLE INTEREST IN AVTOVAZ. Foreign investors have<br>
thus far responded with little enthusiasm to efforts by the Russian<br>
government to resolve the financial problems of the auto manufacturer<br>
AvtoVaz. First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Potanin told the management of<br>
AvtoVaz on December 3 that the enterprise had two months to decide on<br>
issuing additional shares amounting to 50 percent of its capital. That would<br>
permit a strategic investor -- one of the world's major car companies -- to<br>
gain a controlling stake in the company and help it to overcome its<br>
financial difficulties. (Itar-Tass, December 3) <br>
<p>
But a representative of Ford Motors said that his company had no interest in<br>
the AvtoVaz investment scheme and that Ford's existing joint ventures in<br>
Belarus and elsewhere fulfill the company's production requirements in the<br>
region. (Itar-Tass, December 4). Similarly, a BMW official denied reports of<br>
the German company's interest in acquiring a controlling stake in AvtoVaz,<br>
and Adam Opel suggested it might consider joint projects with AvtoVaz, but<br>
had no related investment plans. A representative for the Italian car maker<br>
FIAT observed that Russia remains a risky business environment and that<br>
exporting from countries close to Russia may be a better strategy of<br>
securing a presence in that market than would be direct investment.<br>
(Itar-Tass, December 5)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN MILITARY AFFAIRS REMAIN UNSETTLED. Russia's Duma on December 4<br>
unanimously approved an appeal to the president and government urging an<br>
acceleration of military reform efforts. The appeal was based on the results<br>
of a series of parliamentary hearings on defense reform held in July of this<br>
year, and was approved on the same day that Defense Minister Igor Rodionov<br>
declined an invitation to address the Duma on that subject. (See Monitor,<br>
December 5) In the appeal, the Duma deputies recommended that Boris Yeltsin<br>
create a federal department to oversee the implementation of military<br>
reform, and that this new department be tasked with drawing up guidelines<br>
that will shape the military reform effort to the year 2005. The Duma<br>
document also urged that annual defense spending be raised to at least five<br>
percent of GDP (it is currently just under four percent), and it recommended<br>
that priority funding be directed toward maintaining Russia's nuclear<br>
deterrent and dealing with local conflicts. (Interfax, December 4)<br>
<p>
Duma Defense Committee chairman Lev Rokhlin has been the main driving force<br>
behind the legislators' efforts to influence defense policy, and the call<br>
for a new federal department to oversee military reform is one that he has<br>
voiced in the past. Boris Yeltsin rejected an earlier draft law that would<br>
have established such an agency, and in July created instead the Defense<br>
Council. It is subordinated to the president's office and, nominally at<br>
least, already fulfills the functions envisioned for the Duma's proposed<br>
federal agency. <br>
<p>
Rokhlin also insinuated himself into another major civil-military issue<br>
yesterday when he announced his support for Defense Minister Igor Rodionov's<br>
controversial decision to sack Ground Forces commander-in-chief Vladimir<br>
Semenov. (See Monitor, December 3-4) But Rokhlin did not base his opinion on<br>
the corruption charges that purportedly underlay Rodionov's decision.<br>
Instead, he referred to what he said was Semenov's failure to properly<br>
prepare Russian Ground Forces for the war in Chechnya. Whatever the merit of<br>
that charge, Rokhlin seemed to be on dubious moral and legal ground, both<br>
for failing to condemn Rodionov's still unsubstantiated accusations of<br>
corruption against Semenov, and for stating -- contrary to the law -- that<br>
Rodionov was correct in sacking Semenov without waiting for presidential<br>
approval. (Itar-Tass, December 5) <br>
<p>
SOME RETIRED GENERALS CALL FOR END TO NUCLEAR ARMS. A group of Russian<br>
generals and admirals, chaired by Duma Defense Committee chairman Gen.<br>
(retired) Lev Rokhlin, held a press conference in Moscow yesterday to<br>
publicize a two-month old statement by senior officers from around the world<br>
that calls for scrapping nuclear weapons. The document was developed in<br>
October at the San Francisco "State of the World Forum," sponsored by the<br>
Gorbachev Foundation, and was said to have been signed by more than 60<br>
international senior officers, including 18 from the U.S. and 17 from Russia.<br>
<p>
Some of these military men are apparently having second thoughts. Retired<br>
Gen. Boris Gromov, now also a member of the Duma's Defense Committee,<br>
attended the Moscow meeting and was listed by the London Times as one of the<br>
document's signatories. However, he claimed not to have signed it and noted<br>
that he did not attend the San Francisco meeting. Citing possible NATO<br>
encroachment on Russia's borders, Gromov described the notion of nuclear<br>
disarmament as "premature." (Interfax, December 5) Rokhlin had similar<br>
views: he welcomed the idea of nuclear disarmament but said a new<br>
international security structure could not be built unilaterally and that<br>
Russia's interest must be taken into account. (Itar-Tass, December 5)<br>
<p>
The same caution was expressed on the other side of the Atlantic. U.S.<br>
defense secretary William Perry used the occasion to call for speedy Russian<br>
ratification of the START-2 nuclear arms reduction treaty. He told reporters<br>
that he did not believe in "unilaterally eliminating our nuclear weapons.<br>
You cannot uninvent the nuclear bomb." Perry said that the U.S. would be<br>
willing to start negotiations on further strategic nuclear cuts -- START III<br>
-- immediately after Russia had ratified START II. (Reuters, December 5)<br>
<p>
ARMS EXPORTERS BELIEVE THEY ARE ON A ROLL. Oleg Sidorenko, the deputy<br>
general director of the state-owned Rosvooruzheniye arms exporting company,<br>
predicted yesterday that within 3 to 4 years Russia might surpass the U.S.<br>
as the world's leading arms exporting country. (Interfax, December 4)<br>
Indeed, Russia already holds the top ranking when only developing countries<br>
are counted. Sidorenko was obviously buoyed by the recent deal to sell 50<br>
Su-30MK strike fighters to India. He was also speaking at a weapons fair in<br>
Bangalore, India where the Russians were showing their most modern<br>
equipment, including the Ka-52 all-weather attack helicopter. Unlike their<br>
Soviet predecessors, Russian arms dealers today have no compulsions against<br>
selling their most modern equipment even before it appears in Russian colors.<br>
<p>
India and China--both with large military establishments and a perceived<br>
need for the latest military technology -- have been traditional Russian<br>
customers. So have Syria, Iran and Iraq, and the Russians are bound to pick<br>
up lucrative orders once various arms embargoes are relaxed. But they are<br>
also breaking into new markets in South Korea, Cyprus, Latin America, and<br>
Southeast Asia. And Moscow has been willing to include Western partners in<br>
their sales: the Indian Su-30s, for example, will have some French-built<br>
avionics. <br>
<p>
Soviet arms exports were plagued, among other things, by shoddy post-sales<br>
support and erratic provision of spare parts. Should Russia's current arms<br>
exporters show that they have solved such problems they could truly earn the<br>
status of a growth industry.<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN TERRITORIAL CLAIM TO SEVASTOPOL NOW OFFICIAL. Russia's Federation<br>
Council yesterday adopted, by a margin of 110 to 14 with 7 abstentions, a<br>
statement and a resolution claiming Ukraine's city of Sevastopol for Russia.<br>
The statement refers to Sevastopol as "part of Russia's territory," accuses<br>
Ukraine of "aiming to tear it away," and calls for observance of Russia's<br>
territorial integrity and security interests in resolving the problem of<br>
Sevastopol's status. The resolution condemns "Ukraine's refusal to recognize<br>
Sevastopol's Russian status" and mandates the formation of a Russian<br>
commission, involving the presidency, the cabinet of ministers, the<br>
Federation Council, and the Duma, to draft a law on Sevastopol's status. <br>
<p>
Both documents also include language about the Russian and Ukrainian<br>
peoples' "brotherhood" and the need for good-neighborly relations and<br>
"civilized" negotiations. The chamber accepted the thesis of its member and<br>
initiator of the documents, Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who stated in his<br>
presentation that Russia has an historically inalienable title to<br>
Sevastopol, that legally the city never became part of Ukraine in either<br>
Soviet, Russian, or international law, and that Moscow must get Ukraine to<br>
acknowledge the existence of a territorial dispute as a start toward<br>
resolving it. (Itar-Tass, Interfax, Western agencies, December 5)<br>
<p>
The Duma has already adopted at least two resolutions claiming Sevastopol<br>
for Russia. Such resolutions are nonbinding, and Russia's executive branch<br>
has until now distanced itself from them by stating the "official position"<br>
that Russia lays no territorial claims to Ukraine. However, yesterday's<br>
resolutions appear to mark a turning point and should force Kiev and Western<br>
governments to face up to the full implications of this development.<br>
<p>
The Federation Council consists in large part of President Boris Yeltsin's<br>
appointees, the great majority of whom evidently endorsed the territorial<br>
claim. Until fairly recently, the Kremlin was using that critical mass in<br>
the Federation Council to soften or bury such initiatives. This time, the<br>
move went ahead amid indications of executive branch consent. Prime Minister<br>
Viktor Chernomyrdin on December 3 discussed the issue in terms similar to<br>
those used by Luzhkov and the nationalists, invoking "Sevastopol's soil<br>
packed with Russian bones" and urging Ukraine to negotiate with Russia over<br>
Sevastopol proceeding from the city's legal history. (Itar-Tass, December<br>
3-4) During the latest rounds of Russian-Ukrainian negotiations on the Black<br>
Sea Fleet (late October-early November) Chernomyrdin and senior members of<br>
Yeltsin's staff cited parliamentary initiatives regarding Sevastopol as a<br>
lever to pressure Kiev into concessions. <br>
<p>
Luzhkov is a quasi-"liberal" reformer and at the same time a consistent<br>
promoter of Russian irredentism in Crimea and hegemonic goals in other parts<br>
of the "near abroad." His position indirectly answers Ukrainian president<br>
Leonid Kuchma's recent, rhetorical question as to where Russian moderates<br>
and democrats really stand on policy toward the newly independent states.<br>
Recently reelected overwhelmingly as mayor of Moscow, and virtually safe<br>
from nationalist pressure in that relatively liberal constituency, Luzhkov<br>
does not need to instrumentalize nationalist issues for staying in office.<br>
Even if Luzhkov concluded that he needs to emphasize such issues as a<br>
post-Yeltsin presidential hopeful, his action and the vote in Russia's<br>
Federation Council yesterday prompted Ukrainian deputies in Kiev to reflect<br>
that "Russian democracy tends to stop at the Ukrainian border." (UNIAN,<br>
December 5)<br>
<p>
In the liberal Nezavisimaya gazeta yesterday, two commentaries supported the<br>
initiative on Sevastopol and predicted -- as Luzhkov himself has recently --<br>
that it will develop into a claim to Crimea as a whole. (Nezavisimaya<br>
gazeta, December 5)<br>

NEWS:<br>
<p>
YELTSIN GOES HOME. Russian president Boris Yeltsin has left the Barvikha<br>
sanitarium and returned to his own residence nearby. Doctors say he could be<br>
back at work by the end of this month. Yesterday, Yeltsin met with Prime<br>
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to discuss the ongoing coal miners' strike.<br>
They resolved to send First Deputy Premier Vladimir Potanin to talk to<br>
miners in the Kuzbass, where 100,000 are on strike. (RTR, Reuters, Interfax,<br>
December 4)<br>
<p>
RIGHTS WATCHDOG CRITICIZES WEST. In its annual report issued yesterday, the<br>
U.S.-based Human Rights Watch accuses western nations of putting profits<br>
before human rights. Citing Chechnya as one example, the group said that:<br>
"The most disturbing trend that we saw in the last year was that the major<br>
powers repeatedly deferred the immediate promotion of human rights in the<br>
name of often dubious long-term strategies... At the height of Russia's<br>
renewed slaughter of civilians in Chechnya, the Council of Europe ignored<br>
its own human rights standards to admit Russia as a member, and the<br>
International Monetary Fund awarded Russia a $10 billion loan." (Reuters,<br>
December 4)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN MILITARY GROUP DEPARTS CUBA. A Russian daily suggested on November<br>
30 that talks on military intelligence operations directed against the U.S.<br>
were high on the agenda of a recent visit by a Russian military delegation<br>
to Cuba. The group, which completed its four-day stay on December 3, was<br>
headed by Fedor Ladygin, chief of the General Staff's Main Intelligence<br>
Directorate (GRU). The delegation had traveled to Cuba ostensibly to<br>
participate in celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of Cuba's armed<br>
forces. (Segodnya, November 30; Itar-Tass, December 3. See also Prism,<br>
November 21)<br>
<p>
WAGES FOR THE ARMY: THE CHECK IS IN THE MAIL. Russia's finance minister<br>
announced yesterday that the government had transferred 900 billion rubles<br>
to the Defense Ministry to cover the army's November wages. Funding for the<br>
army's December wages, and to cover payment arrears from October, will soon<br>
be forthcoming, but annual bonuses for 1996 will not be paid until the<br>
beginning of 1997, he added. (Itar-Tass, December 3)<br>
<p>
MILITARY SETS UP OWN PRESS SERVICE. The Russian Defense Ministry has created<br>
its own press service in order to implement "a single information policy by<br>
the Defense Ministry" and improve "the efficiency of work with the Russian<br>
and foreign mass media." The new service is headed by Col. Viktor Baranets,<br>
a military journalist who had been Defense Minister Igor Rodionov's acting<br>
press secretary. (Itar-Tass, November 27)<br>
<p>
KAZAKHSTANI URANIUM THIEVES ON TRIAL. A court in the Kazakh city of<br>
Ust-Kamenogorsk yesterday began the trial of 18 suspects, mostly employees<br>
of the Ulba Metallurgical Complex, in a spectacular case of theft involving<br>
radioactive and rare metals. Three of the accused were said to have been<br>
caught en route to Novosibirsk carrying some 20 kilograms of "radioactive<br>
metals" and 4 kilos of uranium tablets. The Ulba facility produces fuel rods<br>
for nuclear power stations. In 1995 two men were caught smuggling more than<br>
100 kilos of uranium-235 from the plant. (Itar-Tass, RFE/RL, December 4)<br>
<p>
AGING AMMO STORED ON DISPUTED ISLANDS. Russia's Far Eastern Military<br>
district has been storing its obsolete ammunition on islands in the southern<br>
Kuril chain claimed by Japan. The district's commander said on December 4<br>
that his men had begun to destroy old mines and shells on Iturup Island. In<br>
all, more than 500,000 pieces of over-age munitions are to be liquidated,<br>
some of which were also stored on the adjacent Kunashir and Shikotan<br>
islands. The commander said that measures had been taken not to "damage the<br>
unique Kuril environment." (Interfax-Eurasia, December 4)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
GOVERNOR OF PERM OBLAST SEEMS ASSURED OF VICTORY... Russia's regional<br>
elections are proceeding at full tilt. In Perm oblast, where voters will go<br>
to the polls on December 8 to elect an oblast governor and the mayor of the<br>
provincial capital, campaigning is at its height. The incumbent governor,<br>
Gennadi Igumnov, is respected locally and has wide backing from all the<br>
democratic organizations in the region, ranging from "Russia is Our Home" to<br>
Memorial and the NTS. He is expected to win reelection easily, if only<br>
because the opposition is split between two Communist candidates and a third<br>
from Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist party. <br>
<p>
Igumnov's fiercest opposition, in fact, may be Perm's feisty local media,<br>
which are waging a relentless campaign to remind voters of the region's<br>
economic woes. They hammer home the fact that Perm ranks 57th among Russia's<br>
89 regions in attracting new investment, that unemployment is higher than<br>
the national average and that, according to local doctors, only 3 percent of<br>
the oblast's newborn babies are free of disease. The media also stress the<br>
problem of wage arrears. According to the Monitor's correspondent in Perm,<br>
this is such a sore subject locally that it could undermine Igumnov's<br>
chances of reelection. All this attention may not be helping Igumnov's<br>
campaign, but it does testify to the strength of press freedom in the oblast. <br>
<p>
...WHILE MAYOR OF PERM SHOOTS HIMSELF IN THE FOOT. But whereas the<br>
gubernatorial election in Perm oblast is proceeding with relative calm, the<br>
campaign for the mayor of Perm is mired in scandal. It all began when a<br>
local newspaper accused the incumbent mayor, Vladimir Fil, of links with<br>
organized crime. Fil responded to the allegation by attacking his rival for<br>
the post of mayor, chairman of the city legislature Yuri Trutnev. Fil had<br>
200,000 fake leaflets printed and tried to pass them off as Trutnev's<br>
campaign literature. According to Monitor's correspondent, the hoax leaflets<br>
contained boastful statements such as "I want to be boss of this place" and<br>
"I am a karate black belt," but they were so crudely done that no-one was<br>
taken in. Monitor's correspondent says that effect has been to alienate the<br>
electorate from the campaign. Voters suspect, moreover, that the election<br>
has degenerated into a power struggle between local business interests.<br>
<p>
YELTSIN IS FIRST AMONG POLITICIANS, BUT HIS POPULARITY TUMBLES. President<br>
Boris Yeltsin has regained the number one ranking among Russia's politicians<br>
following his recovery from surgery, the Moscow Tribune said yesterday. The<br>
newspaper cited a monthly opinion poll by Russian political analysts as<br>
placing Yeltsin first on the list of Russia's 100 leading politicians. Prior<br>
to surgery, Yeltsin had dropped to third place. Yeltsin's comeback shunts<br>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, in first place since August, to second<br>
place and presidential aide Anatoly Chubais down to third. Moscow mayor Yuri<br>
Luzhkov remains in fourth place. (Xinhua, December 4)<br>
<p>
But while Yeltsin is a no longer being seen as a lame duck president, his<br>
popularity rating has plunged from what it was during the presidential<br>
election this past summer. One reason is that people blame Yeltsin for<br>
failing to honor his election promise to pay wages and pensions on time. The<br>
anger of Russia's striking miners is shared by many. (Moskovskie novosti,<br>
December 1-8) In a November poll of 1,600 Russians by the Russian Public<br>
Opinion Research Center, only 10 percent of respondents said they trusted<br>
Yeltsin (the corresponding figure in July was 29 percent). Trust in<br>
Communist leader Gennadi Zyuganov also fell, from 21 percent in July to 14<br>
percent in November. Aleksandr Lebed is the only politician who still<br>
commands any confidence: his rating fell from 29 percent in July to 24<br>
percent in November. Meanwhile, the number of those saying they trust no one<br>
rose from 17 percent in July to 31 percent in November. (Pravda [special<br>
issue], November 29-December 6)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN DEFENSE CHIEF CITES ARMY'S INTERNAL PROBLEMS. Russian defense<br>
minister Igor Rodionov's press spokesman yesterday denied reports that his<br>
boss had postponed a planned visit to the U.S. because of upheaval atop the<br>
military command over the recent, unexpected sacking of Ground Forces<br>
Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Semenov. Instead, the spokesman attributed<br>
Rodionov's last minute change of plans to what he described as a "sharp<br>
deterioration of the situation pertaining to the funding of the armed<br>
forces," and to concern over "food supplies to far-flung garrisons." On<br>
December 3 Rodionov had postponed a four-day visit to the U.S. that was to<br>
start the next day. Sources in the Russian Defense Ministry indicated<br>
yesterday that the trip is now expected to take place some time next year.<br>
(Interfax, December 4; see Monitor, December 3-4)<br>
<p>
On December 3 Rodionov also cited the army's internal problems as one reason<br>
for his rejection of an invitation to address the Russian Duma on the<br>
subject of military reform. In a letter to Duma Chairman Gennady Seleznev,<br>
Rodionov reportedly suggested that it was pointless at this time to discuss<br>
the issue because "the armed forces today are struggling for their<br>
survival," and "there are no funds for [military] reform" in any event.<br>
Rodionov also said that it would be improper for him to outline the Defense<br>
Ministry's military reform proposals to Russian legislators prior to<br>
discussion of them with armed forces commander-in-chief Boris Yeltsin. The<br>
Duma yesterday agreed to postpone hearings on military reform as Rodionov<br>
had recommended. (Itar-Tass, December 3-4)<br>
<p>
Rodionov's purported concerns over the army's financial situation,<br>
particularly as a justification for his last-minute cancellation of what<br>
were planned to be high-level talks in the U.S., are difficult to take at<br>
face value. The army's financial crisis has been on-going since well before<br>
Rodionov's appointment in July, and on November 19 the Russian defense chief<br>
had said publicly that the funding situation was improving and that the army<br>
had put the worst of the financial crisis behind it. (Reuter, November 19)<br>
Rodionov's behavior in recent days, which can only be described as erratic,<br>
appears in fact to be a result of the embarrassing brouhaha developing over<br>
Semenov's firing, compounded perhaps by what seems to be growing impatience<br>
among Russia's military and political elites over the slow pace of military<br>
reform and the army's continuing financial and morale problems. <br>
<p>
SOME CHECHEN LEADERS PUSH FOR ISLAMIC STATE. "We will form state bodies<br>
based on Islamic law. So-called Roman law is unnatural to Chechens. Many do<br>
not accept it and therefore it is often broken. We must base legislation on<br>
something people will accept. Islam is a suitable basis for the Chechen<br>
people. Otherwise, we will have an ungovernable armed mass," says Movladi<br>
Udugov, deputy premier and chief ideologist of the Chechen resistance.<br>
Udugov says he does not yet know which model of Islamic society Chechnya<br>
will adopt. In his opinion, any choice must be preceded by a thorough study<br>
of the experience of other countries. (Nezavisimaya gazeta, November 30) <br>
<p>
"Secular courts will be gradually replaced in Chechnya by Shariat courts.<br>
The fact that canings are taking place behind closed doors instead of in the<br>
public squares is a temporary concession to Moscow and Western countries. We<br>
will soon be living in a classical Islamic state," Shamsuddin Batukaev,<br>
chairman of Chechnya's Supreme Shariat Court, told the Monitor. Islamic law<br>
and Arabic have been made required subjects in Chechnya's schools by<br>
presidential decree. Religious authorities are already visiting Chechen<br>
schools and warning students that if a girl above the age of ten goes<br>
outdoors in a short skirt, or without covering her hair with a scarf, she<br>
will be punished by the ten strokes provided for in the Shariat. (Groznensky<br>
rabochy, November 15)<br>
<p>
Rapid transition to a religious state may be resisted by a significant<br>
portion of the Chechen population, now quite secularized after years of<br>
Soviet rule. "It is President Zelimkhan Yandarbiev who is helping us most in<br>
building an Islamic state. Unfortunately, some influential Chechen<br>
politicians are not helping us very much," Batukaev told the Monitor,<br>
perhaps referring to Prime Minister Aslan Maskhadov.<br>
<p>
THE BALTIC STATES<br>
<p>
LITHUANIA'S NEW GOVERNMENT INSTALLED. President Algirdas Brazauskas<br>
yesterday approved the composition of Lithuania's new government, formed by<br>
a conservative coalition around Fatherland Union, which won last month's<br>
parliamentary election. FU's Gediminas Vagnorius is the new prime minister,<br>
the Christian-Democrat Algirdas Saudargas foreign minister, his colleague<br>
Ceslovas Stankevicius defense minister, and Confederation of Industrialists'<br>
(CI) vice-chairman Vincas Babilius the new economics minister. The youngest<br>
cabinet member, at age 28, is the successful private entrepreneur -- now<br>
finance minister -- Matileuskas of FU. The new government has been scaled<br>
down to 17 ministries. The parties in the government coalition control  more<br>
than two thirds of the 141 seats in parliament, whose new chairman is FU<br>
leader Vytautas Landsbergis. (BNS, December 4)<br>
<p>
Landsbergis, Vagnorius, and Saudargas held the posts of head of state, prime<br>
minister, and foreign minister, respectively, in the 1990-1992 government<br>
which led Lithuania to independence from the USSR. They are co-founders of<br>
the Sajudis movement that spearheaded the struggle for independence.<br>
Vagnorius, less known internationally than his two colleagues, was born in<br>
1957 and is a trained engineer and economist with the reputation of a<br>
radical economic reformer. The presence of the CI's Babilius in the<br>
cabinet's most powerful economic post reflects the FU's pre-election<br>
agreement with the CI, envisaging an acceleration of market reforms. The<br>
left-of-center Democratic Labor party had approached such reforms cautiously<br>
during its 1992-96 rule.<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
GEORGIAN GUERRILLAS OPERATE IN ABKHAZIA. In a spate of press interviews in<br>
recent days, Georgian state security minister Shota Kviraya, his first<br>
deputy, Avtandil Ioseliani, and refugee leader Tamaz Nadareishvili have<br>
acknowledged that Georgian guerrilla groups have begun operating in<br>
Abkhazia. All three officials stated that the groups are comprised of ethnic<br>
Georgians who were forcibly expelled or otherwise persecuted by the<br>
Abkhazian authorities, or who seek to avenge the loss of home and kin during<br>
the 1992-93 war. Nadareishvili, who chairs the ethnically Georgian rump of<br>
Abkhazia's parliament, operating in Tbilisi, said that the Georgian<br>
government's reliance on negotiations alone to settle the conflict has<br>
increased frustration among the refugees and motivated them to take up arms.<br>
Approximately a dozen guerrilla groups, comprised of five to ten members<br>
each, are operating mainly in Gali, Ochamchira, and Sukhumi districts, the<br>
officials said. They disclaimed any involvement by Tbilisi in equipping or<br>
directing the groups. (Iberia, Iprinda, November 30, December 2; Svobodnaya<br>
Gruziya, December 3, as cited by Itar-Tass)<br>
<p>
A series of attacks on isolated Abkhaz military posts or patrols and on<br>
buildings used by Abkhaz authorities took place in the runup to last month's<br>
illegitimate legislative elections in Abkhazia. As a rule the unidentified<br>
attackers used explosives and light arms, causing few casualties but<br>
substantial material damage. Abkhaz authorities blame the attacks on<br>
Tbilisi, which initially attributed them to rivalries among Abkhaz clans.<br>
The latest statements in Tbilisi, however, would seem to reflect a decision<br>
to generate a degree of military pressure on Abkhazia that will parallel the<br>
negotiating process.<br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
TAJIK INSURGENTS ENTRENCHED IN KEY TOWN. In a three-day battle, Tajik<br>
insurgents have repulsed a government OMON battalion's attempt to retake the<br>
central town of Garm, and have managed to trap that OMON unit, Dushanbe<br>
military officials acknowledged yesterday. The insurgents are offering to<br>
allow the battalion to hand over its arms and withdraw from the region. They<br>
have also offered to release, via neighboring Kyrgyzstan, a group of 118<br>
Tajik army troops taken prisoner when some 200 opposition fighters captured<br>
Garm on December 1. The well-known field commander Mahmadruzi Iskandarov<br>
emerged unscathed from that battle, contrary to initial reports of his<br>
death. The victor-to-prisoner ratio in this battle again illustrates the<br>
disaffection of the conscript troops -- and by implication the population --<br>
with the Dushanbe authorities.<br>
<p>
United Tajik Opposition leaders warned that they would order guerrilla<br>
attacks against Tajik and Russian troops on the eastern approaches to<br>
Dushanbe, if Russian-backed government forces resume attempts to recapture<br>
Garm. The UN mission, which reported that warning yesterday, also announced<br>
that it is withdrawing its military observers from the Garm area for safety<br>
reasons. (Interfax, Itar-Tass, Western agencies, Voice of Free Tajikistan,<br>
December 3-4) While that reasoning may well be valid, the observers'<br>
withdrawal will permit the UN mission to continue disclaiming knowledge of<br>
Russian aviation's involvement in the combat.<br>
<p>
Opposition control of Garm, a key highway junction and administrative<br>
center, would isolate the remaining government outposts in central and<br>
eastern Tajikistan and also cut off Russian border troops in Badakhshan<br>
region. Resupplying them by air from western Tajikistan would be very<br>
problematic in winter. Dushanbe and the Russian military can be expected to<br>
mount an all-out effort to retake Garm in order to avoid a collapse of their<br>
position in that half of the country.<br>

<p>
RUSSIAN, U.S. PRESIDENTS TO MEET. According to presidential spokesmen in<br>
Washington and Moscow, Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin will hold<br>
talks in 1997, probably in the first half of the year. It would be their<br>
first meeting since April; both have since been reelected. Agreement on the<br>
1997 meeting came during talks between U.S. vice president Al Gore and<br>
Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in Lisbon. The date and venue for<br>
the meeting have not yet been chosen. (Reuter, December 3)<br>
<p>
DRAMATIC INCREASE IN MURDER RATE OF RUSSIAN BANKERS. Russian bankers are an<br>
endangered species. Over the past three years, 118 have been murdered. In<br>
1994, the total was 28; in 1995, it was 41; and in the first eight months of<br>
this year it was 49. (Argumenty i fakty, No. 48, November 1996)<br>
<p>
AEROFLOT TO BUY RUSSIAN AIRLINERS. The Russian airline Aeroflot signed a<br>
contract on Monday to buy 20 wide-body Il-96M/T airliners for $1.5 billion.<br>
The planes will be built by the Voronezh Aircraft Manufacturing Company and<br>
be equipped with U.S. Pratt &amp; Whitney engines. The Russian government is<br>
providing a $525 million guarantee for the purchase of the first 7 planes<br>
while the U.S. Eximbank is financing 57 percent of the total deal. In<br>
September a decision by Aeroflot to purchase U.S. aircraft was greeted with<br>
outrage by Russian manufacturers. (Interfax, December 3. See Monitor,<br>
September 11)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN AIR FORCE WOES. The Russian air force did not get a single new<br>
aircraft in 1996, according to an unnamed source at air force headquarters.<br>
In addition, it could not properly maintain the planes it already has.<br>
Average availability fell to 53 percent and some 3,000 planes and<br>
helicopters could not be flown. The source said that funds provided for<br>
maintenance covered less then 10 percent of requirements. (Interfax, December 3)<br>
<p>
ST. PETERSBURG SHIPYARD TO BUILD NEW SUBS. The Admiralty Shipyards in St.<br>
Petersburg will start building 3 diesel submarines for the Russian navy next<br>
year and has 2 more "special orders" for 1998. It also plans to produce a<br>
new-generation submarine by the year 2000. That project is unusual in that<br>
the navy has no money to pay for the design work so a financial-industrial<br>
group (FIG) has been formed to provide credits of $100 million for the<br>
effort. (Interfax, December 3)<br>
<p>
SHIPYARD WORKERS UNPAID DESPITE COURT ORDER. The workers at the Kronshtadt<br>
shipyards, near St. Petersburg, have found that winning a court case to<br>
receive their unpaid wages is one thing--getting their employer to pay the 4<br>
month's salaries owed is another. The shipyard, the principle repair yard<br>
for the Baltic Fleet, is owed 54 billion rubles by the Defense Ministry and<br>
has had to cut its work force from 7,000 to 3,200. The workers say they will<br>
strike if not paid. (Itar-Tass, December 3)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
WHAT RUSSIA GOT OUT OF THE OSCE LISBON SUMMIT. When the 54 disparate<br>
countries that make up the Organization for Security and Cooperation in<br>
Europe (OSCE) must agree on every word in a document, that document is<br>
likely to be a bland one. Such is the Lisbon Summit Declaration and its<br>
appendices and annexes, which contain little that is new but also something<br>
for everyone. Proponents and opponents for NATO expansion will find<br>
sentences to support their positions. To no one's surprise, Russia again<br>
failed to have the OSCE anointed as the foundation of a future European<br>
security system. But the participants did agree on language that Russia will<br>
surely quote in its fight against NATO expansion. The declaration on "A<br>
Common and Comprehensive Security Model for Europe for the Twenty-First<br>
Century" reaffirms that member states have the right to choose their own<br>
security arrangements, including treaties of alliance, but adds that they<br>
"will not strengthen their security at the expense of the security of other<br>
States. Within the OSCE, no State, organization or grouping can have any<br>
superior responsibility for maintaining peace and stability in the OSCE<br>
region, or regard any part of the OSCE region as its sphere of influence."<br>
The summit's "Framework for Arms Control" picks up the same theme: one of<br>
its challenges is to ensure that "no participating State, organization or<br>
grouping strengthens its security at the expense of the security of others,<br>
or regards any part of the OSCE area as a particular sphere of influence."<br>
Another challenge is "military imbalances that may contribute to<br>
instabilities." Without question, Russia sees itself as a victim in all<br>
these scenarios. <br>
<p>
Chechnya was only briefly mentioned, with the participants welcoming "the<br>
recent steps towards a peaceful settlement." Surprisingly perhaps, the<br>
Russians did not object to a statement expressing concern at Moscow's<br>
failure to implement an October 1994 agreement on the withdrawal of Russian<br>
troops from Moldova. Russia did support Belarus in its veto of any reference<br>
to the constitutional crisis in Belarus and demanded the deletion of a<br>
reference to the recent annulment of Serbian regional elections. The most<br>
meaningful Russian victory was in the agreement to review the 1990<br>
Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty. U.S. assistant secretary of<br>
state John Kornblum indicated that the U.S. might support a proposal to do<br>
away with zonal limits entirely, thus eliminating Russia's problems with the<br>
present "flanks" limits that restrict the amount of arms it can station in<br>
the North Caucasus and Leningrad Military districts. The Russians did not,<br>
however, convince the other participants that confidence-building measures<br>
should be extended to naval activities. This means that it is very unlikely<br>
that the new CFE negotiations will cover naval forces as Russia has long<br>
proposed. (Lisbon Document 1996, RFE/RL 2-3 December)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTER POSTPONES U.S. VISIT. The muddle in Russia's<br>
Ministry of Defense over the unexpected sacking of Ground Forces<br>
commander-in-chief Vladimir Semenov has apparently spilled over into<br>
Russia's relations with the U.S. According to unofficial reports out of the<br>
MoD yesterday, Russian defense minister Igor Rodionov has decided to<br>
postpone a high-level visit to the U.S. that was to start today. That news<br>
was later confirmed by a Pentagon spokesman in Washington, who said that the<br>
trip would probably be rescheduled for "some time next year." The reasons<br>
for the last minute trip postponement have yet to be officially explained,<br>
but a Russian diplomat said that the uncertainty over Semenov's status --<br>
and unhappiness among many officers over the harsh treatment meted out to<br>
the Ground Forces commander -- had compelled Rodionov to cancel his visit.<br>
While in the U.S. Rodionov was to have met with Defense Secretary William<br>
Perry, Joint Chiefs of Staff head John Shalikashvili, heads of the State<br>
Department, congressmen, and presidential security advisor Anthony Lake.<br>
Rodionov's visit was to have reciprocated a trip to Moscow in October by<br>
Perry. (Reuter, Itar-Tass, December 3) <br>
<p>
In Moscow, meanwhile, the president's office tried yesterday to distance<br>
itself further from Rodionov's actions. A spokesman said that Boris Yeltsin<br>
had agreed only to suspend Semenov, on Rodionov's recommendation, but that<br>
the issuance of a presidential decree to that affect awaited a further<br>
review of the charges leveled against the Russian commander. Semenov had<br>
been accused by Rodionov of behavior incompatible with the honor of a<br>
soldier, but no specifics regarding that onerous charge were forthcoming<br>
yesterday and Russia's interior minister said that his office -- like that<br>
of the general prosecutor's -- had not been involved in any investigation of<br>
Semenov. Observing that Semenov is popular in the army and that he is no<br>
loyalist of Rodionov's predecessor, Army General Pavel Grachev, one Russian<br>
commentator quoted unnamed military officials as saying that Rodionov saw<br>
Semenov as a rival and therefore sought a pretext to oust him. That<br>
suspicion remains unsubstantiated. But this latest muddle reinforces the<br>
impression that Rodionov, whose appointment in July was greeted with<br>
considerable enthusiasm, may not be up to the job of defense minister at a<br>
time when the army faces overwhelming problems and Russia's military chief<br>
must be as astute and sure-footed a politician as he is a capable military<br>
commander. (Kommersant-daily, December 3. See also Monitor, December 3)<br>
<p>
MASKHADOV GUARANTEES SAFE WITHDRAWAL OF RUSSIAN TROOPS. Chechen prime<br>
minister Aslan Maskhadov yesterday ordered the high command of the Chechen<br>
armed forces to guarantee the security of the Russian units withdrawing from<br>
Chechnya. Federal troops must, the document states, be withdrawn by January<br>
27. (RTR, December 3) Chechen deputy premier Movladi Udugov told the<br>
Monitor: "To avoid provocations, we will guard the Russian troops ourselves.<br>
We see Boris Yeltsin's order on the withdrawal of the 205th and 101st<br>
brigades of Russian troops from Chechnya as a sign that Russia's policy<br>
really is changing towards peace. The fact that the Ivan Rybkin's<br>
appointment as Security Council secretary did not lead to a change in<br>
Russian policy tells us that Yeltsin is still in charge. This gives us hope<br>
for stability. But we are not yet convinced that Moscow will not revert to<br>
her former aggressive policy. We are therefore determined not to give the<br>
Russian 'war party' any pretext to start a new war."<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN MINERS CONTINUE STRIKE. Russian coal miners are in the second day of<br>
a nationwide strike for unpaid wages. Vitaly Budko, leader of the Russian<br>
Independent Trade Union of Coal Industry Workers, said yesterday that about<br>
400,000 of the industry's 560,000 workers were on strike in 181 of Russia's<br>
258 mines. Today's figure includes 100,000 miners in the Kuzbass. President<br>
Boris Yeltsin called yesterday for emergency measures to settle the strike,<br>
and said he might dispatch Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to the<br>
Kuzbass. Miners say the government owes them the equivalent of $472 million<br>
in back pay. In some places, miners are making political demands. They say<br>
that all of their previous efforts to get their wages have come to naught<br>
and that now only the dismissal of the government can bring them relief.<br>
(Interfax, AP, Reuters, December 3; BBC, December 4)<br>
<p>
SARATOV ESTABLISHES SECURITY COUNCIL. The governor of Saratov oblast, Dmitri<br>
Ayatskov, has become the first of Russia's regional leaders to set up a<br>
Security Council in his region. (Itar-Tass, December 3) The council, modeled<br>
on the national agency, will be responsible for protecting human rights,<br>
state, economic and ecological security, and for forecasting and coping with<br>
emergency situations. Police Col. Aleksandr Kosygin, former regional police<br>
chief, is to be Security Council secretary. Earlier this year, Governor<br>
Ayatskov reorganized the regional administration and renamed it the<br>
Government of Saratov.<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN DUMA TO EXAMINE TAX LAWS. The Russian Duma will discuss a number of<br>
changes in the present tax laws. These modifications were proposed during<br>
meetings of the conciliatory commission, where representatives of the<br>
legislative and executive powers tried to reach a consensus on the 1997<br>
Russian state budget. The revision of the tax laws is a necessary<br>
preliminary step to discussion of the revised draft state budget, which will<br>
debated by the Duma on December 6. <br>
<p>
Russia's deputy minister of finance, Sergei Shatalov, declared yesterday<br>
that significant changes will be introduced in the tax regime for<br>
individuals. Income from bank deposits with yields that exceed the<br>
refinancing rate of the Central Bank will be taxable. The government also<br>
intends to bring under control forms of tax avoidance, such as loans given<br>
in very favorable conditions and excessive insurance payments. Shatalov<br>
added that these changes are not a threat to ordinary Russians but to those<br>
who exploit loopholes to avoid paying taxes. Other proposals to be debated<br>
are the introduction of a 15 percent tax on income from any kind of<br>
securities, including state bonds, and the elimination of the advantage<br>
enjoyed by joint-stock companies of reducing taxable profits by setting<br>
aside reserves. A new 1.5 percent tax on hard currency cash purchases is<br>
likely to affect the so-called "shuttle trade", which is carried out by<br>
individuals in cash. The proposed tax reform package also includes a<br>
reduction of excise duties on oil -- from 70 to 55 thousand rubles per ton.<br>
Shatalov warned that the new, lower tax will be applied only when the budget<br>
becomes law and that the current higher tax should be paid until that time.<br>
He said that modifications of the tax regime would allow the government to<br>
raise up to 30 billion rubles in additional revenue. (Interfax, December 3)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
MOLDOVA RETURNING TO POLITICAL TRANQUILLITY. The Moldovan parliament<br>
yesterday approved the resignation of Andrei Sangheli's cabinet of<br>
ministers, instructing it to continue as caretaker until the January 15<br>
inauguration of President-Elect Petru Lucinschi and the formation of a new<br>
cabinet. Addressing the parliament, Sangheli regretted the cabinet's -- and<br>
his own Agrarian Democratic party's -- inability to stop economic decline<br>
and social pauperization in Moldova.<br>
<p>
In office since 1992 and probably the longest-serving prime minister of any<br>
post-Soviet country, Sangheli and his predominantly Agrarian cabinet worked<br>
closely with Western financial institutions and donor countries to implement<br>
macroeconomic reforms and a monetarist policy. Outgoing president Mircea<br>
Snegur and the parliamentary majority under speaker Lucinschi jointly<br>
promoted the reforms, but Snegur broke that consensus by mounting a populist<br>
reelection campaign that encouraged inflationary demands and exploited the<br>
social costs of reforms. He managed to pin those costs on Sangheli, which<br>
was a contributing factor in his receiving only ten percent of the vote as<br>
the Agrarian candidate in the first round of the presidential election.<br>
<p>
Lucinschi, who plans to appoint an above-party "technocratic" cabinet, well<br>
understands the need to continue the reforms. He will also encourage the<br>
formation of a European-style Social-Democratic party and parliamentary bloc<br>
through a merger of several like-minded groups within and outside<br>
parliament. In statements broadcast on December 2 and 3, Lucinschi again<br>
vowed to work with the existing parliament within the limits of the<br>
president's constitutional powers, to "break the atmosphere of fear and<br>
intimidation," and to "stop dividing society into patriots and nonpatriots,<br>
native and nonnative, rightists and leftists, democrats and Communists,<br>
intellectuals and agrarians" -- all transparent allusions to Snegur's and<br>
his pro-Romanian allies' strategy in their year-long election campaign.<br>
(Flux, Basapress, December 3)<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
OSCE SUMMIT UNABLE TO OVERCOME KARABAKH STALEMATE. Armenia yesterday used<br>
its right of veto to force the OSCE's summit in Lisbon to omit a statement<br>
on settling the Karabakh conflict from the meeting's final document. The<br>
draft statement, prepared by the member countries of the OSCE's "Minsk<br>
conference" -- which serves as a negotiating forum on Karabakh -- had been<br>
approved or at least accepted by all countries including Azerbaijan. The<br>
document called for a settlement based on Azerbaijan's territorial<br>
integrity, a legal status for Karabakh giving it the highest degree of<br>
self-government within Azerbaijan, and security guarantees for Karabakh's<br>
population. Addressing the summit, Azerbaijani president Haidar Aliev<br>
rejected Armenia's demand for recognition of Karabakh's secession from<br>
Azerbaijan. Aliev predicted that such recognition will only lead to<br>
Karabakh's unification with Armenia. <br>
<p>
Armenian president Levon Ter-Petrosian in his statement recalled the<br>
none-too-distant anti-Armenian "pogroms" in Azerbaijan and in Karabakh<br>
itself when Azerbaijan controlled it. Ter-Petrosian questioned the value of<br>
any Azerbaijani security guarantees to Karabakh, ruled out a return of<br>
Karabakh to Azerbaijani rule as fraught with the "risk of genocide or<br>
deportation," and argued that "the only way to prevent another tragedy is to<br>
ensure Karabakh's self-determination." Last-day tete-a-tete talks between<br>
Aliev and Ter-Petrosian failed to break the deadlock. To circumvent<br>
Armenia's veto, the draft statement was issued yesterday as a mere<br>
declaration of the OSCE's executive chairman. Russia in its capacity as<br>
permanent co-chairman of the Minsk conference endorsed the pro-Azerbaijani<br>
draft. (Western agencies, Interfax, December 3)<br>
<p>
A durable ceasefire has been in effect in Karabakh since May 1994. The<br>
OSCE's December 1994 Budapest summit had resolved in principle to send<br>
multinational peacekeeping forces there, but the plan has stumbled against<br>
the parties' inability to agree on a political document and Moscow's<br>
attempts to reserve for itself a dominant role in the peacekeeping<br>
operation. Russia has cooled its political support for the Armenian<br>
position, even condemning the presidential election just conducted by<br>
Karabakh. Facing "separatist" challenges in the North Caucasus and<br>
elsewhere, Moscow feels that it must reaffirm at least theoretically the<br>
principle of the territorial integrity of states. At the same time, Russia<br>
remains reluctant to undermine the interests of Armenia, whose government is<br>
Russia's sole willing military ally in the Caucasus.<br>

ESTONIAN MINORITY GOVERNMENT INSTALLED. A minority government took office<br>
yesterday in Estonia, following the involuntary withdrawal of the Reform<br>
party's six ministers. Prime Minister Tiit Vahi did not succeed in bringing<br>
former prime minister Edgar Savisaar's controversial Center party into the<br>
government. Vahi's Coalition party and the Rural Union bloc continue their<br>
partnership in the reshuffled government, which is said to count on the firm<br>
support of 41 out of 101 parliamentary deputies. Vahi acceded in principle<br>
to Rural Union's demand for protective customs tariffs. Estonia's highly<br>
regarded ambassador to the U.S., Toomas Ilves, takes over from the Reform<br>
party's Siim Kallas as foreign minister. (BNS, Radio Tallinn, December 2-3)<br>
<p>
RUSSIA'S NUCLEAR SAFETY AGENCY IS BROKE. The Russian Federal Committee for<br>
Nuclear and Radiation Safety -- Gosatomnadzor -- has no money, owes more<br>
than 682 million rubles, and can no longer function since its communications<br>
have been cut off. The committee monitors safety at all civilian nuclear<br>
facilities, including the Arzamas-16 and Chelyabinsk-70 nuclear centers.<br>
Besides losing domestic and international telephone and fax service, the<br>
committee can no longer use the special "Iskra" system linking it to the<br>
nuclear power plants. (Interfax, November 27, Nezavisimaya gazeta, November=<br>

MOSCOW DENIES BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS CHARGE. A Russian Foreign Ministry<br>
spokesman on November 28 denied an accusation, leveled by a U.S. arms<br>
control official, that Moscow may be producing biological weapons. The<br>
spokesman reiterated Moscow's claim that it has never developed, produced,<br>
or stored biological weapons. John Holum, director of the U.S. Arms Control<br>
and Disarmament Agency, had made the accusation during an international<br>
conference in Geneva devoted to reviewing the 1975 Biological Weapons<br>
Convention. (Reuter, November 26; Itar-Tass, November 28)<br>
<p>
INDIAN JET DEAL WORTH ALMOST $1.5 BILLION. Boris Kuzyk, President Boris<br>
Yeltsin's assistant for military and technical cooperation, has said that<br>
the November 30 deal to supply India with up to 50 Su-30MK jet fighters was<br>
worth almost $1.5 billion. A representative of the arms export company<br>
Rosvooruzheniye said that India will get the first 8 of the aircraft by the<br>
end of next year and might eventually be licensed to build it. (Interfax,<br>
December 2)<br>
<p>
UZBEKISTAN EASES FOREIGN INVESTMENT. Joint ventures will benefit from more<br>
favorable tax regulations in Uzbekistan next year. Investments carried out<br>
in accordance with the republic's investment program will not incur taxes on<br>
profits for seven years. In addition, for joint ventures where foreign<br>
participation is 50 percent or more, the tax rate will decrease with the<br>
size of the investment. The new tax regime will also benefit existing joint<br>
ventures. (Interfax, November 30)<br>

LISBON SUMMIT DECREES NEW CONVENTIONAL ARMS TALKS. Russia won little support<br>
in Lisbon yesterday during the first of a two-day Summit of the Organization<br>
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in its efforts to promote the<br>
OSCE -- rather than NATO -- as the paramount security organization in<br>
Europe. Moscow had lobbied for the same goal, with similar results, at the<br>
last OSCE Summit, in Budapest in 1994. Yesterday, Russian prime minister<br>
Viktor Chernomyrdin forcefully put forward the Russian position: NATO<br>
expansion would create new fault lines in Europe that would worsen "the<br>
whole geopolitical situation in the world=85." But to most of the 54 nations<br>
represented at the meeting, Russia's objections were a "foregone<br>
conclusion", and, as Czech prime minister Vaclav Klaus put it, they saw the<br>
need to get on with the work at hand. In his own remarks to the forum, U.S.<br>
vice president Al Gore discounted Moscow's concerns and said that NATO would<br>
press ahead with its enlargement plans. (Reuters, UPI, December 2)<br>
<p>
Perhaps the most important result of the summit's first day was the decision<br>
to, in effect, reopen the 1991 Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty.<br>
These new negotiations will commence in January in Vienna and could last as<br>
long as 18 months. Besides the 30 NATO, former Warsaw Pact, and Soviet Union<br>
successor states presently party to the treaty, other OSCE members might be<br>
included. Under the terms of the CFE treaty, these 30 countries destroyed<br>
more than 50,000 pieces of military equipment.=20<br>
<p>
Russia has longed complained, however, that the treaty has been overtaken by<br>
the geopolitical changes in Europe, especially in its bloc approach to<br>
weapons' ceilings. The Russians would also like any future arms treaty to<br>
include more than the 5 categories of weapons covered by the present<br>
document. And they have been especially upset with the restrictions placed<br>
on their deployment of arms in the Leningrad and North Caucasus military<br>
districts. At the mandated 5-year treaty review conference held earlier this<br>
year the 30 signatories amended the treaty to give Russia at least a<br>
temporary respite from these restrictions. However, although all 30 of them<br>
were to have ratified this amendment by the current summit, less than<br>
one-third actually did so. That fact suggests that Europe could well be<br>
going back to the drawing board on the issue of conventional arms.=20<br>
<p>
QUESTIONS SURROUND DISMISSAL OF RUSSIAN GROUND FORCES COMMANDER. Russia's<br>
political and military leaderships staggered into another embarrassing<br>
personnel controversy yesterday when it was announced that Ground Forces<br>
commander-in-chief Vladimir Semenov had been sacked for actions that<br>
"besmirched the honor and dignity of a serviceman and [that were]<br>
incompatible with his duties." Initial reports suggested that the dismissal<br>
order had been drawn up by the Defense Ministry leadership and approved by<br>
Boris Yeltsin. But the president's press service later clarified that<br>
Yeltsin had agreed to the dismissal in principle only, and that the decision<br>
had still to be considered by a presidential commission tasked with<br>
reviewing such high level military personnel questions. One source suggested<br>
that Semenov had been suspended, not dismissed, and Yuri Baturin, the<br>
secretary of Russia's Defense Council and the chairman of the Presidential<br>
Commission on Military Appointments, said that he had been unaware of the<br>
order for Semenov's dismissal.=20<br>
<p>
By day's end, moreover, the 56-year-old Semenov had still not managed to<br>
learn the specifics of the charges against him, and had suggested that he<br>
would fight in court to clear his name. According to one report, Semenov was<br>
told by Defense Minister Igor Rodionov only that the accusations were<br>
related to the activities of Semenov's wife, who works in the Moscow office<br>
of the Russian military helicopter manufacturer, Rosvertol. Russia's main<br>
Military Prosecutor's Office, which is known to be investigating a number of<br>
top defense officials on various corruption charges, said yesterday that<br>
Semenov figures in none of those investigations and that it possesses no<br>
materials that might have led to the general's dismissal. (Itar-Tass, Radio<br>
Russia, Interfax, AP, Reuter, December 2)<br>
<p>
Semenov's apparent sacking was all the more unexpected because it came as<br>
his star appeared to be rising. In June of this year he was promoted to Army<br>
General, and his name was bandied about at that time as a possible candidate<br>
for the vacant defense minister's post and later, and more seriously, for<br>
that of General Staff chief. Semenov's Ground Forces have been the service<br>
hardest hit by the military's funding and morale problems of recent years,<br>
and they are slated for reductions under a military reform plan currently<br>
being implemented by the Defense Ministry. But the decision last month to<br>
downgrade the status of Russia's Airborne Forces and to subordinate some<br>
paratrooper units to the military districts was a victory for Semenov and<br>
appeared to raise the possibility that the Ground Forces might regain some<br>
of their former luster. While it remains to be seen whether the dismissal of<br>
Semenov will have any impact on the Ground Forces' status, the inept way in<br>
which it was carried out only served to illustrate anew the confusion and<br>
lack of professionalism that often characterize the actions of Russia's<br>
military-political leadership.=20<br>
<p>
CHECHEN ELECTION OFFICIAL INSISTS ELECTIONS WILL PROCEED AS PLANNED. The<br>
chairman of Chechnya's Central Election Commission, Mumadi Saydaev, has<br>
denied that parliamentary and presidential elections, due to be held on<br>
January 27, will be postponed. Russian human rights activist Sergei Kovalev<br>
called last week for a postponement to allow an accurate register of voters<br>
to be drawn up. Saydaev admitted that there are difficulties with voter<br>
registration and that no solution has yet been found to the problem of where<br>
and how former residents, who fled Chechnya to escape the fighting, will<br>
vote. But he denied that these problems are sufficient reason for postponing<br>
the elections. (Itar-Tass, December 2)<br>
<p>
CHECHNYA BATTLES OIL BOOTLEGGERS, LOOKS TO SHARE IN PIPELINE PROFITS. "About<br>
3,000 tons of oil are illegally extracted in Chechnya every day. The market<br>
price for our oil is about $80 per ton. So we're losing about $240,000 every<br>
day!" Khodzhakhmed Yarikhanov, president of the Chechen oil monopoly YUNKO,<br>
told the Monitor. Homemade gasoline is sold everywhere in Chechnya. It is<br>
surprisingly easy to make: crude oil is simply distilled in a homemade<br>
still. The quality of the resulting product is low, but serviceable, if a<br>
driver is not finicky about his car. All efforts by the Chechen government<br>
to ban illegal production and trading have so far failed. Yarikhanov says<br>
the authorities intend to redouble the battle against the "oil mafias" but<br>
acknowledges that establishing a state monopoly will not be easy. "Moscow<br>
has not yet handed over a kopeck of the promised compensation. There's no<br>
work in the republic and the underground oil business is the only way many<br>
Chechens can feed their families," he told Monitor.<br>
<p>
The government in Grozny also intends to organize a guard for the Chechen<br>
sector of the pipeline which is projected to transport Azerbaijani oil to<br>
western markets. "In this case, the interests of Russia and Chechnya<br>
coincide, since we too are interested in the 'northern variant' for<br>
transporting Azerbaijani oil," Yarikhanov says. The interim agreement signed<br>
by the Russian and Chechen prime ministers on November 23 called for the<br>
question of the joint transportation of oil to be resolved by December 1,<br>
but Russian government sources now say that agreement will not be reached<br>
before the middle of this month at the earliest. (Trud, November 28) Chechen<br>
leaders will negotiate for some one-seventh or one-eighth of the profits,<br>
arguing that this proportion of the pipeline passes through Chechen=<br>
 territory.<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN COAL MINERS TO STRIKE. A national strike of indefinite duration,<br>
called for by the Independent Trade Union of Coal Miners, is scheduled to<br>
start today. Some 80 percent of the total workforce in the coal mining<br>
sector is affiliated with the union. The miners accuse the Russian<br>
government of being "neither willing nor able" to solve the problems of the<br>
industry, and their representatives have called for the government's<br>
resignation. (Interfax, November 22)<br>
<p>
The planned protest action has both economic and political aims. The<br>
workers' main economic demand is the payment of overdue wages, which, as in<br>
other sectors of the Russian economy, have reached enormous proportions.<br>
According to union deputy chairman Ivan Mokhnachuk, some 2.4 trillion rubles<br>
are now owed in unpaid wages. Non-payment by customers has been a major<br>
factor in the development of this situation: the total amount owed for<br>
unpaid coal deliveries is said to amount to 7.45 trillion rubles.(Itar-Tass,<br>
December 2) The miners also seek an increase in government support for the<br>
industry, from the 5.8 trillion rubles earmarked for it in the 1997 draft<br>
budget to a hefty 12-14 trillion rubles. (Interfax, November 22) The level<br>
of state assistance to the coal industry contained in the 1997 budget<br>
actually represents a reduction of 5 percent in nominal terms when compared<br>
to the funding currently being paid out by the government to the coal<br>
sector. (Interfax, November 23)<br>
<p>
The World Bank has been providing support to the Russian coal industry and<br>
it is expected that a decision on the granting of the second tranche of a<br>
$500 million credit will be taken after December 10. However, the president<br>
of the coal mining company Rosugol, Yuri Malyshev, has questioned the<br>
usefulness of the World Bank's assistance. According to Malyshev, little of<br>
the first $250 million given by the bank actually reached the mining regions<br>
and enterprises. Malyshev also criticized the fact that the World Bank<br>
credit can be used only to close mining pits and to improve social<br>
conditions, and not to expand the sector as might be required. Trade union<br>
leader Vitally Budko has voiced similar complaints, and has accused the<br>
government of appropriating the World Bank credit for other ends. (Interfax,<br>
November 23) Indeed, Russia's minister of labor, Gennady Melikyan, has<br>
admitted that the first tranche of the World Bank's credit was not spent<br>
directly on the coal industry. (Itar-Tass, December 2)<br>
<p>
YABLOKO TO TURN ITSELF INTO A POLITICAL PARTY. The Yabloko movement led by<br>
the economist Grigory Yavlinsky held its fifth congress near Moscow this<br>
past weekend. The main decision adopted at the two-day meeting was that<br>
Yabloko will reorganize itself over the next 2-3 years into a political<br>
party in order to be ready to contest the next presidential election, due in<br>
the year 2000. Yavlinsky said the task of the new party will be to present<br>
voters with a democratic alternative to the corrupt and oligarchic political<br>
system which, he said, has taken root in Russia today. At present, he said,<br>
the only alternatives to the present system offered to voters are<br>
nationalist or Communist ones. But he acknowledged that a major hurdle<br>
facing anyone trying to create a mass democratic party in Russia is the<br>
strong aversion among the population to the very concept of a political<br>
party; this, he said, is the legacy of the rule of the CPSU. Guests<br>
attending the two-day congress included Sergei Belyaev of the pro-government<br>
"Russia is Our Home" movement, which has also announced plans to turn itself<br>
into a party, and former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev. (Itar-Tass,<br>
NTV, December 1)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
MOLDOVAN PRESIDENT-ELECT OUTLINES GOALS. Petru Lucinschi, who won Moldova's<br>
December 1 presidential runoff, told his first post-election briefing<br>
yesterday that the overarching goal of his presidency will be political<br>
stability. Lucinschi, who ran as an independent candidate, said he would<br>
appoint a non-party cabinet of national trust supported by the existing<br>
parliamentary majority. He also pledged to respect the division of powers<br>
between the branches of government, to ensure political representation of<br>
various social and ethnic groups, and to negotiate actively Transdniester's<br>
autonomy within a single Moldovan state. This agenda contrasts with defeated<br>
incumbent Mircea Snegur's quest for a presidential regime, his campaign<br>
strategy based on political and ethnic polarization, and his virtual<br>
acceptance of the Russian-imposed stalemate in Transdniester.<br>
<p>
On foreign policy, Lucinschi reaffirmed Moldova's neutrality, its choice to<br>
stay out of NATO while participating in NATO's Partnership for Peace<br>
program, nonparticipation in CIS military undertakings, interest in economic<br>
cooperation with Russia, Ukraine, and non-CIS neighbor Romania, active<br>
membership in European institutions, and future accession to the European<br>
Union. Lucinschi stated that he would seek to use former contacts in Moscow<br>
in order to improve Moldovan-Russian relations, and that he would actively<br>
seek the withdrawal of Russian troops from Moldova. Except on this latter<br>
point, on which Lucinschi sounds firmer than Snegur, Lucinschi's foreign<br>
policy agenda generally seems to spell continuity with Snegur's. (Flux,<br>
Basapress, December 2)<br>
<p>
A MOSCOW CONNECTION? Lucinschi's presumed Moscow contacts (see above) date<br>
back to the end of the Gorbachev era when Lucinschi was a CPSU Politburo<br>
member and a Central Committee secretary responsible for the mass media.<br>
Those contacts are perceived in Chisinau as a political asset, but are<br>
greatly overrated and in any case politically irrelevant today. Moscow<br>
passed up several opportunities to support Lucinschi -- or for that matter<br>
Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli, Snegur's other rival -- in this election.<br>
The Russian government conspicuously declined to lean on the Transdniester<br>
authorities to allow the region's residents to vote -- a prospect feared by<br>
Snegur, whose support in that region is close to nil since his alliance with<br>
the Romanian-oriented Popular Front. Moscow also withheld from Lucinschi and<br>
Sangheli any hint of flexibility on the ratification of the interstate<br>
treaty and the implementation of the troop withdrawal agreement, which<br>
Snegur's two challengers had tried to elicit during the presidential<br>
campaign. The Duma and Federation Council embarrassed Lucinschi with two<br>
aggressively anti-Moldovan statements during and immediately after<br>
Lucinschi's pre-election visit to Moscow. Snegur's passivity in the face of<br>
faits accomplis in Transdniester appeared to suit Russian policy.<br>
<p>
Moldova's residual Party of Communists, whose candidate Vladimir Voronin<br>
received 10 percent of the vote in the first round of the presidential<br>
election, attacked Lucinschi for introducing perestroika in Moldova as its<br>
party leader in 1989-90 and ultimately breaking up that party. Nevertheless,<br>
Communist voters -- mostly ethnic Russians -- rallied behind Lucinschi in<br>
the runoff because of Snegur's alliance with nationalist pro-Romanian<br>
groups. While Snegur -- who once was a Moldovan CP Politburo member under<br>
Lucinschi -- struck up a tactical alliance with the Moldovan "right wing" in<br>
this campaign, Lucinschi positioned himself as a representative of European<br>
social-democracy.<br>

LUCINSCHI ELECTED MOLDOVAN PRESIDENT. Parliament chairman Petru Lucinschi<br>
defeated incumbent president Mircea Snegur yesterday in Moldova's run-off<br>
presidential election. With almost the entire vote counted as of 9:00 GMT<br>
(11:00 Chisinau time) today, Lucinschi had won 53.25 percent to Snegur's<br>
46.75 percent, officials told The Monitor. The turnout was a strong 70<br>
percent, despite a boycott by Transdniester authorities. Snegur, who had<br>
conducted an inflammatory campaign against Lucinschi, paid him a courtesy<br>
visit today to concede defeat, the officials said. (Monitor interviews,<br>

YELTSIN MAY VISIT KREMLIN SOON. Sergei Mironov, chief Kremlin doctor, says<br>
President Yeltsin will be able to increase his work load after December 5,<br>
when a month will have passed since his heart operation. Yeltsin's press<br>
secretary added that the president plans to make several trips from the<br>
Barvikha sanitarium outside Moscow to the Kremlin after that date.<br>
(Interfax, November 29; Itar-Tass, November 30)<br>

CHERNOMYRDIN PREDICTS IMF WILL SOON RESUME PAYMENTS. Russian prime minister<br>
Viktor Chernomyrdin says he expects the International Monetary Fund to<br>
release the delayed October tranche of its $10.2 billion loan to Russia in<br>
mid-December. Chernomyrdin spoke after meeting IMF managing director Michel<br>
Camdessus in Paris last week. (BBC World Service, November 28) The Fund<br>
withheld the October disbursement because of Russia's poor tax collection<br>
record.<br>
<p>
YELTSIN SACKS COMMANDER OF RUSSIAN LAND FORCES. Russian president Boris<br>
Yeltsin has issued a tersely worded decree dismissing the commander of<br>
Russia's ground forces, army Gen. Vladimir Semenov, for "actions that<br>
discredit the honor and dignity of a serviceman." No more concrete reason<br>
was given and the general has already dismissed the charge as groundless.<br>
Semenov will be replaced by his deputy until a new commander is appointed.<br>
(BBC World Service, December 2)<br>
<p>
SEVEROMORSK NOW A CLOSED CITY. President Boris Yeltsin has decreed that the<br>
northern city of Severomorsk, together with 5 adjoining communities, is to<br>
be a closed administrative-territorial district. The city, 16 kilometers<br>
northeast of Murmansk, is home to the headquarters of the Northern Fleet and<br>
to a military shipyard. The presidential press service said that the decree<br>
would create "a reliable security zone" for these facilities while ensuring<br>
"the ecological safety of the population." (Itar-Tass, Krasnaya zvezda,<br>
November 26)<br>
<p>
RUSSIANS TEST RAILROAD STRATEGIC MISSILE. The Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF)<br>
fired a railcar-based SS-24 intercontinental ballistic missile from the<br>
Plesetsk cosmodrome on November 24. An SRF official said it was the 5th<br>
strategic missile training launch this year, and the first of a rail-based<br>
missile in 6 years. With 10 individual warheads, the SS-24 would be banned<br>
should the START-II treaty enter into force. (Interfax, November 28)<br>
<p>
RUSSIA, UKRAINE AGREE ON PAYMENT FOR STRATEGIC BOMBERS. Russia has<br>
reportedly agreed to credit Ukraine between $320 and $350 million to obtain<br>
25 of the 44 ex-Soviet strategic bombers that Ukraine inherited when the<br>
USSR broke up. These include 10 of the 19 Tu-160 "Blackjack" supersonic<br>
bombers and 10 of the 25 Tu-95MS turbo-prop missile carriers Ukraine<br>
possesses. The negotiations over the aircraft have been going on for more<br>
than a year. The payment will be deducted from Ukraine's energy debt to<br>
Russia. (Interfax, November 30)<br>
<p>
KAZAKHSTAN MAY DOUBLE EUROBOND OFFER. Kazakhstan is considering doubling the<br>
size of its planned eurobond issue to $200 million, Prime Minister Akezhan<br>
Kazhegeldin said last week. (Financial Times, November 27) Russia's debut<br>
eurobond, issued earlier last month, was also doubled in response to strong<br>
demand by potential investors.<br>

MOSCOW TALKS TOUGH ON EVE OF OSCE SUMMIT. Following nearly two months during<br>
which Moscow emitted mixed signals on the issue of NATO enlargement,<br>
Russia's political elite moved collectively in the lead-up to the OSCE<br>
Summit in Lisbon to re-emphasize Russia's opposition to the eastward<br>
expansion of the Western alliance. President Boris Yeltsin punctuated<br>
Moscow's new-found solidarity when he took a hard line on the issue during<br>
talks on November 29 with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Foreign<br>
Minister Yevgeny Primakov. According to presidential spokesman Sergei<br>
Yastrzhembsky, Yeltsin emphasized that Moscow's attitude toward enlargement<br>
remains unchanged and negative. NATO expansion, Yeltsin reportedly said,<br>
"will lead to the appearance of new demarcation lines in Europe." In a<br>
restatement of Moscow's long-held position on the issue, Yeltsin also<br>
reportedly urged the participants of the Lisbon Summit -- which opens today<br>
-- to pursue the construction of a new European security system in which the<br>
central role is played by the OSCE (rather than NATO). (Interfax, November 29)<br>
<p>
Chernomyrdin and Primakov are to represent Russia in Lisbon, and they--or<br>
their subordinates -- have been at pains in recent days to make the same<br>
points. During an official visit last week to France, Chernomyrdin warned,<br>
among other things, that a system of European security cannot be built<br>
without Russia's participation. He also said that "NATO expansion at any<br>
cost" would violate Russia's security interests and would complicate "the<br>
military and geopolitical situation in Europe." (Itar-Tass, November 27) <br>
<p>
Harsher words still came from Defense Minister Igor Rodionov, who was quoted<br>
in a Russian daily on November 27 as saying that NATO enlargement could<br>
recreate Cold War tensions between East and West. According to Rodionov, the<br>
alliance's expansion could eventually allow NATO's air forces to reach<br>
central Russia, while the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons in Eastern<br>
Europe (something NATO has said it has no plans to do) would represent a<br>
strategic nuclear threat to Russia. In addition, the acquisition by NATO of<br>
strategic naval bases in the Baltic states would limit the activities of<br>
Russia's own Baltic Fleet, Rodionov said. He warned that Russia might<br>
consider a series of military countermeasures, including the creation of its<br>
own military alliance, disavowal of nuclear and conventional arms control<br>
agreements, and, conceivably, the retargeting of some of its nuclear<br>
missiles at Eastern European capitals. But, in a tip-off that Moscow still<br>
seeks a compromise, Rodionov also said that many of Russia's concerns would<br>
be eased by the conclusion of an agreement with NATO that set out acceptable<br>
conditions under which enlargement is to proceed. (Interfax, November 28)<br>
<p>
CHECHNYA WITHDRAWAL BEGINS. After much huffing and puffing, the Russian Duma<br>
last week dropped its threat to impeach President Yeltsin and to vote no<br>
confidence in the Russia government. Instead, the Duma on November 29 merely<br>
urged Yeltsin to "reconsider" both his decision to withdraw the last two<br>
brigades of federal troops from Chechnya and to implement the agreement<br>
signed on November 23 by the Russian and Chechen prime ministers. (Interfax,<br>
November 29) Seeking an explanation for the Duma's meek behavior, Russian<br>
commentators said that the call for impeachment had been issued by hard-line<br>
Communist Duma leaders in an effort to rally the ranks of opposition<br>
moderates who were showing signs of coming to terms with the government over<br>
the 1997 budget. That attempt failed because, in the end, moderate deputies<br>
outnumbered radicals. What clinched the issue was that the deputies took<br>
seriously Yeltsin's threat to dissolve parliament if it voted no confidence<br>
in the government. (RTR, December 1)<br>
<p>
Yeltsin ignored the Duma's actions. On December 1, two days after the Duma<br>
called on him to reconsider the troop withdrawal, a convoy carrying<br>
equipment belonging to the Interior Ministry's 101st Brigade left the<br>
Chechen capital of Grozny. The brigade is one of the last two remaining in<br>
Chechnya; both have been ordered out by Yeltsin. Officials said the<br>
withdrawal was proceeding smoothly and was expected to be completed by<br>
January 25, two days before Chechnya's scheduled presidential and<br>
parliamentary elections. The Chechen side respected its commitment not to<br>
hamper the movement of the convoy. (AP, December 1)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN PUBLIC SUPPORTS CHECHNYA PULLOUT. An opinion poll conducted in<br>
Moscow on November 29-30 by the VCIOM polling organization found that 69<br>
percent of respondents approved of Yeltsin's decision to withdraw the last<br>
two brigades from Chechnya. Only 16 percent disapproved, while 15 percent<br>
were undecided. (NTV, December 1) A poll conducted on November 26-27 among<br>
residents of 11 Russian cities by the "Public Opinion" polling organization<br>
came up with almost identical data: 70 percent approval of the troop<br>
withdrawal, 17 percent disapproval, and 13 percent undecided. (ORT, November<br>
28) NTV commented that this was a rare example of consensus between the<br>
provinces and the metropolis.<br>
<p>
ELECTION CAMPAIGN GETS UNDER WAY IN CHECHNYA. Chechen president Zelimkhan<br>
Yandarbiev, prime minister Aslan Maskhadov, and field commander Shamil<br>
Basaev have all officially declared their intention to run in Chechnya's<br>
presidential election, scheduled for January 27. (ORT, December 1) All three<br>
stand for Chechnya's full independence from Russia, but Yandarbiev is<br>
believed to have the support of rural residents while Maskhadov, who is<br>
favored by Moscow, has the support of a number of influential Chechen<br>
financial and industrial figures. Basaev, who has enjoyed huge popularity in<br>
Chechnya since he led the raid on the Russian town of Budennovsk in June<br>
1995, is seen by some commentators as a stalking-horse who may run in order<br>
to take votes away from Maskhadov but stand down in favor of Yandarbiev<br>
toward the end of the campaign. So far, no candidate favoring union with<br>
Russia has come forward. Doku Zavgaev, the former Moscow-backed head of<br>
state, has confirmed that he will not stand. (Itar-Tass, November 27)<br>
<p>
Other possible candidates include former Duma speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov and<br>
the president of the Confederation of the Peoples of the Caucasus, Yusup<br>
Soslambekov. Neither is considered to have much hope of defeating Yandarbiev<br>
or Maskhadov, however. Chechen field commander Salman Raduev, who led the<br>
raid on the Dagestani town on Kizlyar in January of this year, has said he<br>
plans to run for the post of vice president. (Itar-Tass, November 28)<br>
<p>
Meanwhile, a new Russian/Chechen conflict has appeared on the horizon.<br>
Moscow is insisting that some 350,000 former residents of Chechnya who fled<br>
to Russia to escape the fighting must take part in the voting. Many are<br>
ethnic Russians. The Chechen leadership wants only those currently residing<br>
in Chechnya to vote. Russian human rights activist Sergei Kovalev, who last<br>
week visited Chechnya, has called for the elections to be postponed because<br>
electoral lists are incomplete, facilitating falsification. Both Moscow and<br>
Grozny want the OSCE to monitor the election. The head of the OSCE mission<br>
to Chechnya, Swiss diplomat Tim Guldimann, says two OSCE election<br>
specialists are presently in Grozny studying the situation and the<br>
organization will decide on the basis of their report whether or not to<br>
agree to monitor the elections. (Itar-Tass, November 29-30; NTV, December 1)<br>
<p>
AIR FORCE, AVIATION INDUSTRY STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE. Three recent incidents<br>
highlight the extraordinary steps Russian military aviation and its<br>
providers have taken to try and survive in the bleak post-Soviet economic<br>
climate. One is to sell Russia's top combat planes abroad. On November 30<br>
Indian and Russian officials signed an agreement under which India will buy<br>
as many as 50 of Russia's latest strike fighter, the Su-30MK. An official at<br>
the Rosvooruzheniye state arms export company said that deal was worth more<br>
than $1 billion. The aircraft is not yet in service with the Russian Air<br>
Force. The deal will provide stability at the Irkutsk plant where it will be<br>
built and will undoubtedly help subsidize domestic procurement. A<br>
Rosvooruzheniye source also indicated that Russia would provide six Ka-50<br>
"Black Shark" attack helicopters worth $200 million to Slovakia to offset<br>
part of the Russian debt to that country. Only a handful of Ka-50s are in<br>
Russian service. (Itar-Tass, November 30, Komsomolskaya pravda, November 28)<br>
<p>
Russian aircraft manufacturers are also trying gain access to Western<br>
technology. One such effort is the joint venture between the U.S. National<br>
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Tupolev Design Bureau to<br>
develop a new generation of supersonic aircraft. Last Friday the Tu-144LL, a<br>
modified version of Tupolev's "Concordski" jet liner, made its first test<br>
flight from the Zhukovski Flight Research Center outside Moscow. This flying<br>
laboratory is scheduled to make a total of 32 test flights over the next 6<br>
months. (Interfax, November 29)<br>
<p>
Finally, the Russian military has been forced to hire out its planes and<br>
crews for commercial purposes, although not always with the best results. On<br>
November 27 an Il-76 transport of the Air Force's Military Transport Command<br>
crashed in Siberia soon after takeoff from the town of Abakan, killing all<br>
on board. It was carrying 13 passengers and 30 metric tons of commercial<br>
freight bound for Petropavlovsk on the Kamchatka Peninsula. (Interfax,<br>
November 28)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
YELTSIN VETOES BLACK SEA FLEET BILL. Russian president Boris Yeltsin on<br>
November 28 vetoed the bill, approved by both chambers of the Russian<br>
parliament, on halting the partition of the ex-Soviet Black Sea Fleet and<br>
its coastal infrastructure between Russia and Ukraine. Yeltsin argued in his<br>
veto message that the bill should have mandated the suspension, rather than<br>
the halting, of the fleet's partition, in order to make possible the<br>
resumption of negotiations. He also said that the bill failed to<br>
specifically stipulate that the fleet's ex-Soviet status had ceased.<br>
(Rossiiskie vesti, November 30) Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma responded<br>
by publicly urging Yeltsin to de-couple the fleet dispute from the bilateral<br>
treaty on good neighborly relations, and to visit Kiev soon for signing that<br>
long-overdue treaty. (Interfax-Ukraine, UNIAN, November 30)<br>
<p>
The majority of Yeltsin's backers in both chambers had supported the bill,<br>
which was initiated by the Communist-nationalist opposition. The Ukrainian<br>
parliament had responded with a bill of its own that would declare the<br>
Russian-controlled bulk of the fleet an occupation force and give Moscow<br>
until the year 2000 to withdraw it from Ukrainian territory. The Russian<br>
executive branch firmly links the fleet talks to the signing of the<br>
interstate treaty, which is supposed to include a long-overdue official<br>
recognition of Ukraine's borders. <br>
<p>
RUSSIAN LEFTISTS IN EASTERN UKRAINE READY TO PLAY ETHNIC CARD. Ethnic<br>
Russian leftist and neonationalist groups from Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk<br>
regions have passed a resolution of no confidence in Ukrainian president<br>
Leonid Kuchma at a conference held in Donetsk on November 30. Industrial<br>
managers, regional deputies, and representatives drawn from some 50 labor,<br>
political, and ethnic organizations held Kiev responsible for the region's<br>
economic crisis and urged the formation of a "Working Donbass Social and<br>
Political bloc" to advance the region's interests. The participants also<br>
called for action to maintain the position of the Russian language in the<br>
school system and public life. It also issued a strong condemnation of the<br>
government-backed effort by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kiev Patriarchy to<br>
win independence from the Russian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchy. <br>
<p>
On the same day, a conference of Russian citizens who reside in Crimea<br>
denounced "the Ukrainian authorities' offensive against Russians in Ukraine<br>
and Crimea." It appealed to the Russian government to confer Russian status<br>
on Sevastopol and to hold up the completion and signing of the interstate<br>
treaty with Ukraine. (Itar-Tass, UNIAN, Interfax-Ukraine, November 30)<br>
<p>
Russian leftist groups in eastern Ukraine have until now failed in their<br>
occasional attempts to use the ethnic card to spark a movement for autonomy<br>
from Kiev. The agenda of the Donetsk conference would seem to reflect a more<br>
serious attempt by local leftists to combine socioeconomic grievances with<br>
Russian nationalist demands in the apparent hope of starting an autonomy<br>
movement in the linguistically russified region. <br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
TAJIK OPPOSITION CAPTURES MAJOR TOWN; GOVERNMENT NETS DEFECTOR. The Tajik<br>
opposition yesterday captured the district center of Garm, defeating<br>
superior forces fielded by the Internal Affairs and State Security<br>
Ministries. The opposition's successful operation, which was credited to<br>
Field Commanders Mahmadruzi Iskandarov and Mirzo Zieyev, also netted for it<br>
materiel and prisoners. The Dushanbe government conceded the loss of the<br>
town and said that it had lost all contact with the area. (Interfax,<br>
December 1) The government also admitted today that it is conducting air<br>
strikes against Garm in an attempt to retake the town. The aircraft crews<br>
are most probably Russian. (Itar-Tass, December 2) The capture of Garm,<br>
which serves as the center of a cluster of districts, increases the area<br>
under opposition control in Tajikistan's narrow middle section. It also<br>
brings the opposition closer to its goal of isolating the country's eastern<br>
and central regions from Dushanbe in the west. The government troops'<br>
defeat, despite their superiority, and the apparent readiness of some of<br>
them to surrender, confirms their poor morale.<br>
<p>
Dushanbe, meanwhile, announced that Rizvon Sodirov, former commander in<br>
chief of the opposition forces, has arrived in Dushanbe from Afghanistan and<br>
has offered his political services to the Tajik government in the interest<br>
of "national accord." Sodirov had been removed from his command in 1995 by<br>
the opposition's political leadership, which accused him of insubordination<br>
and suspected his loyalty. The opposition's military performance improved<br>
significantly after Sodirov's ouster. His defection will probably earn him<br>
amnesty from the 1992 death sentence passed against him by the Dushanbe<br>
authorities. (Itar-Tass, November 28)<br>

<p>
UKRAINE MAY OPT FOR NATO. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry's policy planning<br>
chief, Ihor Harchenko, stated yesterday at a Kiev briefing that Ukraine may<br>
in the future seek to join NATO, depending on Russian claims to Sevastopol<br>
and on general European security trends. First Deputy Foreign Minister Anton<br>
Buteyko conveyed this same message last week in visits to Bonn, London, and<br>
NATO headquarters in Brussels, and also while attending a North Atlantic<br>
Assembly session in Paris, Harchenko added. (Interfax-Ukraine, November 26)<br>
<p>
MOSCOW APPLAUDS IRAQ AGREEMENT. Russia yesterday welcomed an agreement<br>
between Iraq and the UN that will permit Baghdad to sell $2 billion worth of<br>
oil in order to buy food and supplies for the country's civilian population.<br>
In Moscow Russia's foreign ministry took some credit for conclusion of the<br>
long-delayed agreement, and a spokesman reiterated the readiness of Russian<br>
organizations and companies to serve as suppliers to Iraq in accordance with<br>
the UN decision. (Itar-Tass, The New York Times, November 26)<br>
<p>
AZERBAIJANI PRIME MINISTER CONFIRMED. President Haidar Aliev yesterday named<br>
Arthur Rasizade as Prime Minister, a post that he had filled in an acting<br>
capacity since July. Rasizade, 62, headed the economics department of the<br>
Azerbaijani Communist party's Central Committee and was deputy prime<br>
minister of the republic during the final Soviet years. He then withdrew<br>
into academic life. A respected economist, Rasizade was drafted back into<br>
the government this year to replace Prime Minister Fuad Guliev, whom Aliev<br>
criticized for delays in implementing reforms. (Turan, Interfax, November 26)<br>
<p>
GEORGIAN PARAMILITARY GROUP MEMBERS SENTENCED. The Supreme Court yesterday<br>
sentenced Davit Otiashvili to death and 17 members of his group to prison<br>
terms ranging from 8 to 15 years for banditry and other crimes. The<br>
defendants belonged to a unit of the paramilitary organization Mhedrioni<br>
[Knights], which played a major role in Georgia's recent period of turmoil.<br>
President Eduard Shevardnadze managed in 1995 to ban the Mhedrioni, whose<br>
once highly influential leader, Jaba Ioseliani, is now due to go on trial.<br>
(Interfax, November 26) <br>
<p>
RUSSIA TO SEND MILITARY ADVISORS TO TAJIKISTAN. Some 70 Russian military<br>
advisers, headed by a colonel-general yet to be named, will shortly be<br>
attached to the Tajik Defense Ministry, according to Tajikistan's first<br>
deputy defense minister, Maj. Gen. Aleksandr Chubarov. He said that the<br>
chief advisor will have direct access to the country's president and prime<br>
minister. The other advisors would be attached to units of the Tajik army.<br>
(Interfax, November 26) <br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
CONTROVERSY OVER RUSSIAN TELECOMS DEAL. Further controversy has flared over<br>
Russia's plans to privatize its telecommunications sector. The World Bank<br>
had already objected to the government's plans to merge Rostelekom, the<br>
state-owned company that controls long-distance communications in Russia,<br>
with Svyazinvest, which controls Russia's regional communications network.<br>
(See Monitor, November 22) Controversy heightened yesterday when the<br>
government confirmed rumors that it was dismissing the consortium of western<br>
investment banks, headed by N.M. Rothschild, which had been handling the<br>
planned public sale of $1 billion worth of shares in Rostelekom and<br>
Svyazinvest. Instead, the government is passing control to two Russian<br>
banks, Alfa Bank and the Most group. (Financial Times, BBC World Service,<br>
November 26) Alfa and Most were members of the team of six leading Russian<br>
financial companies that bankrolled Yeltsin's reelection campaign (to the<br>
tune of $3 million). Their involvement in the telecoms deal is controversial<br>
since they are expected to act not only as advisers but also as investors.<br>
As with last year's controversial shares-for-loans scheme, this development<br>
is likely to exclude not only western investors but also Russian investors<br>
outside the charmed circle of big finance houses close to the Yeltsin team.<br>
The World Bank has already threatened to withdraw funding from the telecoms<br>
modernization scheme, warning that the resultant monopoly will be neither<br>
efficient nor competitive.<br>
<p>
STILL NO DECISION ON IMF CREDITS. An IMF mission departed Moscow yesterday<br>
without having made a decision on the resumption of credits to Russia within<br>
the framework of its $10.2 billion Extended Fund Facility. The IMF had<br>
withheld the monthly payment of this credit in October, primarily because of<br>
its dissatisfaction with the rate of tax collection in Russia. Thomas Wolf,<br>
the permanent representative of the IMF in Russia, said that the IMF mission<br>
will return to Moscow in December and that a pause in the negotiations was<br>
necessary to properly assess tendencies observed in state fiscal revenues.<br>
Tax revenues did increase in November over preceding months, but Wolf said<br>
it was necessary to monitor the stability of this tendency. According to<br>
Aleksandr Livshits, Russian minister of finance, budget revenues in November<br>
are expected to reach 18 trillion rubles -- 3.5 trillion more than in<br>
October and 8 trillion more than in September. (Interfax, November 26) A<br>
final decision on the extension of further credits to Russia will be taken<br>
when the IMF Board of Directors meets December 10-13, which means that the<br>
next monthly tranche of $340 million might not come until late December or<br>
January. (Interfax, November 26)<br>
<p>
RUSSIA EXTENDS RUBLE BAND FOR ANOTHER YEAR. The chairman of Russia's Central<br>
Bank, Sergei Dubinin, announced yesterday that the ruble's sliding peg<br>
exchange rate will be extended until the end of 1997. The ruble will be<br>
allowed to fall in line with inflation by a steady 0.3 to 1.1 percent a<br>
month against the U.S. dollar. It will begin 1997 within a range of 5,500<br>
and 6,100 rubles to the dollar, and should finish the year at between 5,750<br>
to 6,350 to the dollar, Dubinin said. (Itar-Tass, AP, November 26) Russia's<br>
inflation rate has fallen steadily this year and is expected to total around<br>
20 percent for the year as a whole. The government is predicting an<br>
inflation rate of 12 percent for 1997. <br>
<p>
VAZ THREATENED WITH BANKRUPTCY, MAY FACE TAKEOVER. The Volga Auto Plant<br>
(VAZ), which produces Lada cars, is facing bankruptcy. The company, located<br>
in Samara oblast, is Russia's biggest car producer. First deputy prime<br>
minister Vladimir Potanin told yesterday's meeting of the special government<br>
committee set up to collect taxes that VAZ owes the equivalent of $2 billion<br>
in taxes. VAZ has long ranked as the number-one debtor to the federal<br>
budget, but in the past it has warded off threats of bankruptcy by<br>
negotiating special tax concessions. For all its problems, VAZ remains a<br>
major Russian export earner and a vital part of the economy of the Volga<br>
region. With 110,000 workers, it is Russia's eighth largest employer. But<br>
Potanin said yesterday that the government will launch bankruptcy<br>
proceedings unless VAZ takes steps to reschedule its debts. He said the<br>
government is considering several options. One of these would involve the<br>
auto giant agreeing to a takeover by outside investors; the workforce<br>
currently owns 49 percent of the company's equity. Potanin said the<br>
government would give VAZ two months in which to decide. (Itar-Tass, NTV,<br>
AP, November 26) <br>
<p>
Meanwhile, the head of Russia's bankruptcy agency, Petr Mostovoi, speculated<br>
today that Italy's FIAT or an Asian car producer might be interested in<br>
acquiring control of VAZ. FIAT played a major role in the construction of<br>
VAZ in the 1970s, when western production methods were first introduced to<br>
Soviet factories. (Itar-Tass, November 27) At present, the company's annual<br>
profits amount to less than it owes in unpaid taxes. <br>
<p>
RUSSIA, FRANCE AGREE ON TSARIST DEBT SETTLEMENT. Russia and France have<br>
signed a bilateral memorandum under which Russia will pay debts incurred by<br>
the Russian government prior to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. The agreement<br>
was signed yesterday during the visit to Paris by Russian prime minister<br>
Viktor Chernomyrdin. Holders of pre-revolutionary bonds had claimed that the<br>
sum owed amounts to $30 billion, but French prime minister Alain Juppe said<br>
yesterday that the sum under discussion totals around $400 million. The<br>
agreement reportedly states that this is to be paid off within four years.<br>
Clearing these debts will remove the last obstacle to Russia's accession to<br>
the Paris Club of creditor nations, which will in turn allow Russia to<br>
reclaim money it is owed by a number of developing countries. Juppe said<br>
yesterday that France wants to see Russia join the Paris Club, and that<br>
discussions toward that end are now underway. (Itar-Tass, UPI, November 26)<br>
<p>
YELTSIN DECREES DEFENSE REDUCTIONS. In a move likely to please Russia's<br>
military leadership, President Boris Yeltsin has decreed that the army and<br>
all other military agencies must reduce their personnel strength by 15<br>
percent over the next year. Russia's military leadership had already<br>
resigned itself to the personnel cuts, which were announced some weeks ago,<br>
but had long complained that similar reductions were not being forced upon<br>
Russia's other "power ministries." Yeltsin's decree, announced by his press<br>
office yesterday, appears to address that complaint. The decree also ordered<br>
that all draftees be sent solely to the armed forces, border forces, and<br>
railroad security troops, a provision that is also likely to be welcomed in<br>
the Defense Ministry. Russia's high command has argued that chronic manpower<br>
shortages in the armed forces have been in part a consequence of a policy<br>
that dispersed the nation's shrinking number of available draftees to all of<br>
those same "power ministries." <br>
<p>
Yeltsin's decree also tasked the Defense Council with drafting a new concept<br>
of military development through the year 2005, and ordered it to forward<br>
that document to the president's office together with recommendations on the<br>
future composition, structure, and strength of Russia's national security<br>
forces. (Itar-Tass, November 26) That order appears to reflect the growing<br>
influence of the Council, which was created in July of this year as a<br>
counterweight to Aleksandr Lebed's Security Council. Since that time Lebed<br>
has been ousted from the government. But, as Segodnya security analyst Pavel<br>
Felgengauer has observed, the Defense Council nevertheless seems set to<br>
become the main coordinating body for Russian defense policy. The Security<br>
Council, on the other hand, has been "exiled," more or less, to the more<br>
limited area of policy toward Chechnya. (Segodnya, November 21)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
BELARUS: BLOODLESS COUP D'ETAT IN FULL SWING. Belarus president Aleksandr<br>
Lukashenko yesterday hosted a large group of parliamentary deputies who<br>
split from the legitimate parliament and endorsed Lukashenko's draft<br>
constitution, which would give the president absolute powers. According to<br>
the presidential camp, 106 deputies (of a total of 199) signed a document of<br>
allegiance to Lukashenko and declared themselves ready to join the lower<br>
house of a new, bicameral parliament envisaged in the presidential draft<br>
constitution and deprived of any powers. This group proclaimed itself to be<br>
the lawful parliament, pending the formation of the bicameral one. It also<br>
"validated" the results of the November 9 - November 24 "referendum," which<br>
Lukashenko has cited to justify his actions. The leaders of this group of<br>
deputies and Lukashenko himself referred to the lawful parliament as<br>
"former" parliament and vowed to complete the formation of the new bicameral<br>
parliament by Christmas. The president confidently predicted that it would<br>
not be necessary to formally disband the "former" parliament.<br>
<p>
The legitimate parliamentary leaders, meanwhile, chaired  a session in the<br>
parliament building attended by only 56 deputies, less than the quorum of<br>
100 required for decisions. These deputies showed every inclination of<br>
resisting the presidential coup. Also yesterday, the Constitutional Court<br>
decided following an agonizing debate to drop impeachment proceedings<br>
against Lukashenko. That decision came after some parliamentary deputies had<br>
withdrawn their signatures from the impeachment petition, bringing the<br>
number of signatories to below the minimum of 70 required for pressing the<br>
case. (Belaplan, Radio Minsk, Interfax, November 26) The Alliance in Defense<br>
of Democracy, comprised of some 20 extraparliamentary groups of<br>
national-democratic orientation, today supported parliament chairman Syamyon<br>
Sharetsky's appeal for international support to the lawful parliament, and<br>
also called for demonstrations in Minsk. (Western agencies, November 27)<br>
<p>
BATTLE LINES DRAWN IN MOLDOVA'S PRESIDENTIAL RUNOFF. President Mircea Snegur<br>
-- in office since 1990 -- and parliament chairman Petru Lucinschi are<br>
competing in Moldova's December 1 presidential runoff. Snegur received 39<br>
percent of the vote in the November 17 first round. Already backed by one of<br>
the two pro-Romanian parties, Snegur has more recently been endorsed for the<br>
runoff by the other pro-Romanian party, whose candidate won 9 percent in the<br>
first round. Lucinschi received 28 percent in the first round, and has been<br>
endorsed in the runoff by the Agrarian-Democratic and Communist parties,<br>
whose candidates won 10 percent each in the first round. The raw arithmetic<br>
thus gives Snegur and Lucinschi each 48 percent of the vote.<br>
<p>
Both alliances are unnatural and marked by distrust among the partners. The<br>
two pro-Romanian parties have long and viciously attacked Snegur because of<br>
his unwillingness to seek unification of Moldova with Romania. Snegur has<br>
now made a tactical alliance with them against the Agrarians who blocked his<br>
quest for authoritarian power. The president has made specific promises to<br>
enhance the power and influence of the pro-Romanian groups and bring them<br>
into the government if he wins the election. Should he win, he may well seek<br>
to backtrack from the promises since he fundamentally distrusts those<br>
groups. The pro-Romanian groups also remember only too well that Snegur had<br>
been their ally in 1989-1991 before dropping them. <br>
<p>
Lucinschi for his part is despised by Moldova's Communists for his role in<br>
destroying the old Moldovan Communist party. Appointed party leader by<br>
Mikhail Gorbachev, Lucinschi enforced perestroika in the republic at the<br>
cost of splintering the Party and facilitating the takeover of political<br>
power by a coalition of reformist and nationally-minded groups. As chairman<br>
of parliament since 1993, Lucinschi joined with Snegur and the Agrarians to<br>
promote the macroeconomic reforms that earned Moldova international approval<br>
and credits. The Communists attacked Lucinschi during the presidential<br>
campaign because of his reformist record, but rallied to him reluctantly for<br>
the runoff out of fear of Romanian nationalism. Lucinschi has made clear<br>
that he would not appoint any Communists to the government if he wins the<br>
election. <br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
AZERBAIJAN PENALIZES RUSSIA'S LUKOIL. The chairman of Azerbaijan's State Oil<br>
Company, Natig Aliev, yesterday stated that Baku does not intend to invite<br>
Russia's Lukoil to participate in the prospecting and development of a<br>
highly promising oil deposit on Azerbaijan's continental shelf. Baku's<br>
attitude toward Lukoil has changed because of the company's failure or<br>
unwillingness to influence the Russian government's "rigid position" on the<br>
legal status of the Caspian Sea, Aliev said. He directly contradicted Lukoil<br>
chairman Vahit Alekperov's recent statement in Baku that Lukoil will be<br>
included in the agreement on drilling the Inam site. Inam is estimated to<br>
contain 200-300 million tons of oil. (Petroleum Information Agency, November<br>
26) <br>
<p>
Lukoil participates in all three major international oil projects currently<br>
underway on Azerbaijan's shelf. It has stakes of 10 percent in<br>
Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli, 32.5 percent in the "Karabakh" site, and 10 percent<br>
in Shah-Deniz. Not only Baku but also the major international oil companies<br>
participating in these projects had expected that the inclusion of Lukoil<br>
would help persuade the Russian government to recognize Azerbaijan's legal<br>
title to its own sector in the Caspian Sea where these operations take<br>
place, and by implication the sectoral division of the sea. The Russian<br>
government, however, has warned from the outset that it will continue<br>
withholding legal recognition of national sectors despite the share awarded<br>
to Lukoil in those projects. <br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
KAZAKH PREMIER UNDER PRESSURE IN MOSCOW. The "rights of Kazakhstan's<br>
Russian-speaking population" was said to be among the topics raised by<br>
President Boris Yeltsin's chief of staff, Anatoly Chubais, during talks<br>
yesterday with the visiting prime minister of Kazakhstan, Akezhan<br>
Kazhegeldin. Chubais reportedly expressed concern over Kazakhstan's language<br>
policy, which would require state officials and civil servants to know the<br>
Kazakh language when named to -- or confirmed in -- their posts. Chubais<br>
also pressed Kazhegeldin to consider a Russian proposal aimed at creating a<br>
joint concern of Caspian states to exploit oil and gas deposits in a large<br>
central zone of that sea on the basis of "common ownership" -- a proposal<br>
opposed by both Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. Kazhegeldin's response implied<br>
polite disagreement on both counts. However, he shied away from raising the<br>
matter of Russian arrears in rent due to Kazakhstan for use of the Baikonur<br>
cosmodrome, and even abjured any claim to compensation for related<br>
ecological damage. According to Kazakhstan's Moscow embassy, Russia is<br>
supposed to pay $115 million in annual rent for Baikonur, but has paid<br>
nothing since 1992. (Interfax, November 26; Argumenty i Fakty, no. 47,<br>
November 1996) Russia signed a 20-year lease for the facility in 1994.<br>
However, the agreement provided that the cost of the lease would be deducted<br>
from Kazakhstan's debt to Russia.<br>
<p>
Kazakhstan's president Nursultan Nazarbayev has signed the language policy<br>
concept and the Majlis has just adopted the language law, which includes a<br>
10-year deferral of native language tests for non-native -- in practice<br>
mostly Russian -- officials. The law seeks to halt Soviet-era linguistic<br>
russification of Kazakhstan. (See Monitor, November 26) Chubais' remarks<br>
suggest that Moscow intends to raise the language issue in order to place<br>
Almaty on the defensive on other issues. Yeltsin's staff also said that the<br>
convalescent president had raised the language issue with Nazarbayev during<br>
their 20-minute meeting on November 23 at Yeltsin's sanitarium.<br>

NEWS:<br>
<p>
MASKHADOV MAY RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF CHECHNYA. Chechen prime minister Aslan<br>
Maskhadov has hinted that he may stand in the presidential election<br>
scheduled for January 27. (Interfax, November 25) Maskhadov's candidacy<br>
would be welcomed in Moscow, which sees the former resistance leader as a<br>
moderate with whom it can do business more easily than with Chechnya's more<br>
radical leaders.<br>
<p>
NEARLY 1,000 INTERIOR TROOPS KILLED IN CHECHEN WAR. Officially, Russia's<br>
Interior Ministry lost 968 soldiers during the Chechen war and another 4,642<br>
were wounded. The troops' commander, Col. Gen. Anatoly Shkirko revealed that<br>
35 of his men were missing in action and another 13 were known to be<br>
prisoners of the Chechen separatists. (RIA Novosti, November 25)<br>
<p>
TOKYO AGAINST RUSSIAN APEC MEMBERSHIP? Japanese prime minister Ryutaro<br>
Hashimoto denied yesterday that Tokyo opposes Russia's admission into the<br>
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC). But Japanese Foreign<br>
Ministry officials intimated simultaneously that Japan might back Vietnam<br>
and Peru for membership rather than Russia, reportedly because Japanese<br>
leaders believe that Russia's major economic centers are located too far<br>
from the Asia-Pacific region. The 18 APEC leaders concluded a meeting<br>
yesterday. (Itar-Tass, November 25)<br>
<p>
YELTSIN REJECTS DEFENSE LAW. Russian president Boris Yeltsin yesterday<br>
rejected for the second time a draft law "on military reform," claiming that<br>
the latest version is virtually identical to one that he had refused to<br>
approve in July. Yeltsin had returned the original draft to the Duma<br>
because, in his view, it included provisions that encroach on presidential<br>
prerogatives. (Rossiiskie vesti, November 21) On November 22 three Duma<br>
committees sent recommendations to the government calling for accelerated<br>
military reform. (Interfax, November 22)<br>
<p>
AUDIT REVEALS IRREGULARITIES IN RELATION TO RUSSIAN FOREIGN DEBT The<br>
accounting commission, a parliamentary organ that audits and monitors state<br>
finances, has discovered a number of irregularities in the work of the<br>
Vneshekonombank and the Ministry of Finance in relation to the foreign debt.<br>
The report pointed out the existence of inadequate accounting standards and<br>
the practice of hiring external consultants for very high fees. A total of<br>
$2 billion is unaccounted for and will be the object of further<br>
investigation (Interfax, November 23).<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
COMMUNISTS THREATEN YELTSIN WITH IMPEACHMENT. The Russian Duma has scheduled<br>
an emergency debate for Friday, November 26, to discuss both President<br>
Yeltsin's decree ordering the last two brigades of federal troops out of<br>
Chechnya and the interim framework agreement signed by the Russian and<br>
Chechen prime ministers on November 23. The agreement, which sets out<br>
relations between Grozny and Moscow, gave the republic wide autonomy ahead<br>
of Chechen elections set for January 27. Communist and nationalist<br>
parliamentarians charge that the agreement and the troop withdrawal amount<br>
to "treachery." Zyuganov says the Communist faction will propose a motion of<br>
no confidence in the government and another leading Communist<br>
parliamentarian, Viktor Ilyukhin, says deputies may also try to impeach the<br>
president on the grounds of unconstitutional conduct. The leader of the<br>
pro-government "Russia is Our Home" faction, Sergei Belyaev, has dismissed<br>
the Communists' complaints as "hysterical" while Yabloko says its members<br>
will abstain.<br>
<p>
The Russian constitution lays down such strict requirements for impeachment<br>
(two-thirds majorities in both houses of parliament and the approval of both<br>
the Supreme Court and Constitutional Court, all within a time limit of three<br>
months) that the Duma is highly unlikely to be able to carry out its threat.<br>
(Interfax, Reuters, November 25)<br>
<p>
BRIGADES TO WITHDRAW BUT SOME RUSSIAN TROOPS TO STAY. Although the last two<br>
major Russian military units will be withdrawn from Chechnya before the<br>
elections scheduled for the end of January, a sizable Russian armed presence<br>
will apparently remain in the republic. Ivan Rybkin, the secretary of the<br>
Security Council, told a Moscow press conference yesterday that the<br>
departing 101st Brigade of Interior Troops and the Defense Ministry's 205th<br>
Brigade had a total complement of between 8,000 and 10,000 men while the<br>
total Russian contingent in Chechnya totaled some 20,000.<br>
<p>
Rybkin emphasized that Chechen authorities would have to approve this<br>
continuing military presence and suggested that they were unlikely to object<br>
if individual units of Ministry for Emergency Situations, Railway Troops,<br>
field-engineering, and medical units stayed in Chechnya. Some Border Troops<br>
will also remain to patrol the Russian-Georgian border along with Chechen<br>
units. <br>
<p>
Sources in the General Staff indicated that the military's 205th Brigade<br>
would be redeployed to the city of Budyonnovsk in the Stavropol region,<br>
while the brigade's 204th motorized rifle regiment would be stationed in the<br>
city of Buinaksk in Dagestan, adjacent to Chechnya. As for the withdrawal<br>
from Chechnya itself, Rybkin indicated that Defense Minister Igor Rodionov<br>
had approved the plan but that Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov "had a<br>
different opinion on this question...." (Interfax, 25 November)<br>
<p>
MORE MIXED SIGNALS FROM MOSCOW ON NATO? Russia's military and political<br>
leaderships have in recent days continued their habit of speaking in several<br>
voices on NATO enlargement. Following talks with his Slovak counterpart in<br>
the Russian capital on November 23, Russian defense minister Igor Rodionov<br>
declared that Moscow had not "softened" its position on the issue and that<br>
he personally remained opposed to enlargement. (Itar-Tass, November 23) But<br>
that view appeared to contradict, in spirit at least, remarks made by<br>
Rodionov less than a week earlier following talks with British defense<br>
minister Michael Portillo. Rodionov strongly suggested then that he had been<br>
persuaded by Portillo that NATO no longer constitutes a military threat to<br>
Russia. (Reuter, November 19) <br>
<p>
Rodionov's remarks following the November 19 Portillo meeting had been<br>
described by Izvestiya as yet another breach in Moscow's diplomatic effort<br>
to oppose NATO enlargement and as a confirmation that Russia's political<br>
elite is no longer unified on the issue. The newspaper observed further that<br>
the nation's Foreign and Defense Ministries appeared to have exchanged roles<br>
on the issue, with Russia's diplomats emerging as hawks and working with<br>
determination to dispel the perception that Moscow has in any way resigned<br>
itself to NATO's plans. (Izvestiya, November 21) Indeed, Foreign Minister<br>
Yevgeny Primakov reportedly made precisely this point during his own meeting<br>
with Portillo on November 20. According to a foreign ministry spokesman,<br>
Primakov emphasized that there had been no "erosion" in Russia's opposition<br>
to enlargement. He was reported also to have admonished Portillo that "those<br>
who initiate this [enlargement] process will take upon themselves<br>
responsibility for the appearance of new lines of division in Europe [and]<br>
for an inevitable worsening of the international climate." (Interfax,<br>
November 21) <br>
<p>
Former Russian Security Council secretary Aleksandr Lebed had taken an<br>
unexpectedly accommodating stance toward NATO and its enlargement plans<br>
during and after his visit to NATO headquarters in Brussels in early<br>
October. (See Monitor, October 8-10) Following Lebed's ouster on October 17,<br>
his successor, Ivan Rybkin, emerged as the most outspoken proponent of a<br>
more flexible policy toward NATO, calling for Russia to seek membership in<br>
the Western alliance. Rybkin's original articulation of that proposal<br>
provoked a sharp rebuke from Primakov, but the new Security Council<br>
secretary has persisted in his views. (See Monitor, November 4, 13) Rodionov<br>
did not prove so hardy. His criticism of NATO on November 23 appears to have<br>
been a response to signs of displeasure from the Foreign Ministry that<br>
followed his friendly meeting with Portillo. <br>
<p>
GOOD RESULTS FOR THE FIRST RUSSIAN EUROBOND ISSUE. Russia on November 21<br>
launched its first international issue since the Bolshevik revolution.<br>
Demand was high and bids totaled $2 billion. A total of $1 billion were<br>
placed at 5 years, with a yield of less than 10 percent. (IPS, November 22)<br>
The Russian minister of finance, Aleksandr Livshits, declared on November 22<br>
that the Russian government aimed to keep yields low by restricting the<br>
quantity of bonds offered. The main purchasers were the U.S. (41 percent),<br>
South Korea (29 percent) and European countries (30 percent). Livshits and<br>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said that the reaction to the issue<br>
demonstrated the confidence of foreign investors in Russia's economic<br>
prospects. (Interfax, November 22) The appeal of the eurobonds to investors,<br>
both national and foreign, has been increased by the decision to make them<br>
tax-free. The positive results of the eurobond issue will allow the Russian<br>
government to reduce yields in the domestic bond market. (Interfax, November 22)<br>
<p>
It is expected that the successful eurobond issue will facilitate the entry<br>
of Russian companies, as well as local and regional authorities, into world<br>
financial markets. Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, has expressed an interest<br>
in tapping into the eurobond market. The city of Moscow intends to launch an<br>
issue for up to $500 million by December as part of an effort to raise $1.5<br>
billion from domestic and foreign sources. St Petersburg has similar plans.<br>
Livshits has stated that the government should allow regional and municipal<br>
bonds, but under regulated conditions. Neither Moscow nor St. Petersburg<br>
currently have credit ratings. (IPS, Interfax, November 22)<br>
 <br>
The euphoria generated by the enthusiastic acceptance of the Russian<br>
eurobond issue did not lead Moscow to disregard the importance of good<br>
relations with the IMF. Returning from the New York presentation of the<br>
eurobonds, First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Potanin declared that the<br>
money raised is no substitute for credit expected from the IMF, which has<br>
been delayed because of tax-collection problems. (Interfax, November 22)<br>
According to Livshits, the success of the issue will not have a direct<br>
impact on current negotiations with the IMF, but it should nevertheless<br>
demonstrate to IMF experts the real situation in the Russian economy.<br>
(Itar-Tass, November 22) <br>
<p>
RUSSIA TO REPAY TSARIST DEBTS. Trading in tsarist bonds was suspended in<br>
Paris yesterday after Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin promised<br>
that "Russia will pay its debts." His remark was understood to mean that<br>
Russia intends to repay debts inherited from the tsars but repudiated by the<br>
Bolsheviks following the 1917 Revolution. Chernomyrdin made the announcement<br>
as he left on an official visit to France, where many of the descendants of<br>
those who invested in Russian imperial bonds live. The Bolshevik government<br>
defaulted on bonds held by French investors in retaliation for French<br>
support of Russia's White Army. Bond-holders claim the sum owed amounts<br>
today to $30 billion. Though Moscow disputes this figure, it is keen to<br>
clear these debts since doing so will remove the last obstacle to Russia's<br>
accession to the Paris Club of creditor states. That in turn will enable<br>
Russia to reclaim money it says it is owed, as the USSR's successor, by<br>
countries such as Ethiopia and Cuba. (Itar-Tass, BBC World Service, AP,<br>
November 25; Financial Times, November 26) The Speaker of the Russian Duma,<br>
Gennady Seleznev, immediately criticized Chernomyrdin's statement, saying<br>
repayment of the old imperial debts could set a dangerous precedent. (BBC<br>
World Service, November 26)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
UKRAINE AGAINST RUSSIAN TROOPS IN MOLDOVA. In a statement issued yesterday,<br>
Ukraine's Foreign Ministry rebutted the Russian Duma's recent resolution,<br>
which declared Moldova's Transdniester region a "zone of special Russian<br>
interests" and mandated the Russian government to station Russian troops<br>
there permanently. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry commented that the<br>
resolution jeopardizes a political settlement and "violates the generally<br>
accepted norms of international law. Ukraine recognizes Transdniester as<br>
part of Moldova and promotes a settlement "based on Moldova's sovereignty<br>
and territorial integrity and the inviolability of its borders," the<br>
statement said. (UNIAN, November 25)<br>
<p>
The Russian government hardly needs the Duma's prodding to keep the troops<br>
in Moldova. The government has itself blocked indefinitely the<br>
implementation of the 1994 troop withdrawal agreement. The stationing of<br>
Russian forces in Transdniester, hard on Ukraine's border, has certain<br>
parallels to the situation in nearby Crimea and poses added security<br>
problems for Ukraine. <br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
ABKHAZ ELECTION OFFSET BY REFUGEE REFERENDUM. The Abkhaz leadership<br>
yesterday claimed an overwhelming turnout in the November 24 legislative<br>
election. Out of 35 legislative seats, 30 were adjudicated in the first<br>
round and 5 will be filled after runoffs. Most candidates were Communists<br>
and their allies. The Abkhaz leaders failed to acknowledge the fact that the<br>
election took place in the absence of the great majority of the republic's<br>
ethnic Georgian population, ethnically cleansed by Russian-backed Abkhaz<br>
troops in the 1992-93 war. The major powers and international organizations<br>
declared the Abkhaz election invalid in advance.<br>
<p>
Most of the refugee population, now sheltered in Georgia proper and in other<br>
former Soviet republics, took part in another referendum, also held on<br>
November 24. This group overwhelmingly agreed with the ballot proposition<br>
that any elections in Abkhazia are invalid before the return of the refugees<br>
and the determination of the region's political status as part of Georgia.<br>
(Interfax, Iprinda, November 24-25) <br>
<p>
The new Abkhaz legislature is meant to cement the region's secession from<br>
Georgia and to replace the former Abkhaz Autonomous Republic's Supreme<br>
Soviet. That body split in 1993 into a group of 28 deputies who continued as<br>
the Abkhaz Supreme Soviet and another group of 26 deputies who moved to<br>
Georgia and continue to constitute an exiled parliament of Abkhazia. <br>
<p>
ARMENIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT BLESSES PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. Armenia's<br>
Constitutional Court on November 22 declared the result of the September 22<br>
presidential election valid and rejected the opposition's petition to<br>
invalidate it as fraudulent. The Court's ruling is final, unappealable, and<br>
effective immediately. The opposition had predicted such a ruling by the<br>
politicized Court even before the proceedings began, and walked out of the<br>
proceedings last week after the Court declined both to subpoena key<br>
documents from the Central Election Commission and to hear numerous<br>
opposition witnesses.<br>
<p>
United Opposition presidential candidate Vazgen Manukian and other leaders<br>
of opposition parties stated in the wake of the ruling that their goals in<br>
petitioning the Court had been: to offer the government and the Court an<br>
opportunity to address the issue of electoral fraud, to publicize the<br>
opposition's case before internal and international opinion, and to prove<br>
the opposition's adherence to legal processes after the September 25<br>
storming of the parliament by opposition supporters. <br>
<p>
The opposition intends to continue demanding a repeat election. At an<br>
opposition rally in central Yerevan, Manukian warned that the government has<br>
a choice of meeting that request or facing a revolution. The National<br>
Self-Determination Union, Paruir Hayrikian, for its part continued<br>
advocating strict reliance on legal methods and proposed an appeal to the<br>
European Court of Human Rights. This potential rift within the opposition<br>
has been apparent ever since the government's post-election crackdown on<br>
opposition parties. The opposition leaders are, however, at one in asserting<br>
that the Constitutional Court's verdict does not legitimize the fraudulent<br>
presidential election. (Noyan-Tapan, Armenpress, Interfax, November 22-25)<br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
KAZAKHSTAN'S LANGUAGE LAW SEEKS TO EQUALIZE NATIVE LANGUAGE WITH RUSSIAN.<br>
Russian president Boris Yeltsin has proposed to Kazakh president Nursultan<br>
Nazarbayev that a bilateral document be drafted that would "secure the<br>
rights of the Russian language as such on the entire territory of<br>
Kazakhstan," Russian presidential spokesman Sergey Yastrzhembsky announced<br>
yesterday. The proposal was a response to the November 22 passage by the<br>
Kazakhstani Majlis' of the Law on Languages.<br>
<p>
That law enshrines the Kazakh language as the state language. Article 22<br>
obligates Kazakhstan's executive branch to draw up a list of managerial,<br>
administrative, and service-sector posts whose holders are to be required to<br>
possess a working knowledge of the Kazakh language. The article gives<br>
non-Kazakh speakers holding such posts--in practice mostly Russians--until<br>
January 2006 to learn the native language to the extent necessary for<br>
discharging their duties, and to pass a language test. The law introduces<br>
the Kazakh language on a par with the Russian as the language of command in<br>
the armed forces, police, and security services. It further stipulates that<br>
television and radio stations, irrespective of their form of ownership, are<br>
to allocate at least as much airtime for Kazakh-language programs as they do<br>
for programs in other languages--in practice meaning Russian.<br>
<p>
Most ethnic Russian deputies and their supporters in Moscow resisted the law<br>
and particularly Article 22 by claiming that institution of a state language<br>
amounts to discrimination against "Russian-speakers." The ten-year time<br>
frame for the language test mollified some opponents. The law now goes to<br>
the Senate. <br>
<p>
Arguing in support of the law, State Committee for Nationality Affairs<br>
chairman Georgy Kim pointed out that the native language is being<br>
marginalized by the Russian in Kazakhstan's public life, and that the<br>
modest, post-Soviet revival of the native language is faltering. Only 23<br>
percent of kindergartens and only 40 percent of general schools offer<br>
instruction in the Kazakh language. Kazakh is the language of administration<br>
and record-keeping in only 16 percent of the country's enterprises and<br>
organizations, while 14 percent use Russian and Kazakh and 70 percent<br>
Russian only. (Interfax, Itar-Tass, November 22)<br>

NEWS:<br>
<p>
BELARUS PRESIDENT CLAIMS VICTORY IN "REFERENDUM." An official unlawfully<br>
appointed by President Aleksandr Lukashenko as head of the Central Election<br>
Commission claimed today that more than 84 percent of Belarusan voters had<br>
turned out in the constitutional referendum, and that an unspecified but<br>
purportedly large majority voted for the president's draft constitution and<br>
against the parliament's. Lawful CEC chairman Viktar Hanchar, ousted from<br>
that office by Lukashenko in violation of the constitution, dismissed the<br>
turnout figure as falsified. (Itar-Tass, November 25)<br>
<p>
KARABAKH PRESIDENT REELECTED. President Robert Kocharian was reelected<br>
yesterday to a five-year term with 86 percent of the vote, Karabakh 's<br>
electoral commission reported today. Kocharian's two challengers had agreed<br>
with him on full independence from Azerbaijan. A trained engineer and head<br>
of Karabakh's military effort during most of the 1988-1994 fighting,<br>
Kocharian was first elected president in 1994 for a two-year term. (Western<br>
agencies, November 25) Yesterday's election was strongly protested by<br>
Azerbaijan and disavowed by international organizations and the countries<br>
that mediate the Azerbaijan-Karabakh Armenian conflict. <br>
<p>
LEBED SEES LUZHKOV AS POTENTIAL ALLY. Back in Moscow after a visit to the<br>
U.S., Aleksandr Lebed told Russian TV that he sees Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov<br>
as a potential ally in the event of a presidential contest. (RTR, November<br>
24) This is the second time Lebed has made such a statement. The two men are<br>
united in their hatred of presidential aide Anatoly Chubais. But Luzhkov,<br>
who has presidential ambitions of his own and who has called Lebed's<br>
peacemaking in Chechnya a betrayal of Russian interests, has not commented<br>
on the possibility of an alliance. <br>
<p>
RUSSIA'S INTERIOR MINISTRY WANTS MORE POWERS. Interior Minister Anatoly<br>
Kulikov is campaigning for his ministry to have equal powers with the Tax<br>
Police. He is also asking that citizens be required to furnish the police<br>
with documentation showing how they came by the funds with which they bought<br>
expensive cars or houses, or closed lucrative deals. Kulikov says his<br>
officers need such  powers in order to combat economic crime. (Radio Russia,<br>
November 21)<br>
<p>
NO PROGRESS IN KURIL ISLAND TALKS. The seventh round of Russian-Japanese<br>
negotiations on fishing rights in the waters around the disputed Kuril<br>
Islands concluded in Tokyo on November 22, apparently without recording any<br>
progress. A Russian report said that Japan's unwillingness to recognize<br>
Russian sovereignty over the islands remains the main stumbling block to<br>
fashioning a regime by which Japanese boats could fish the waters in<br>
question. (Itar-Tass, November 22) <br>
<p>
SLOVAKIA, RUSSIA SIGN AGREEMENTS. Representatives of Slovak and Russian<br>
government ministries, meeting in Moscow on November 23 under the auspices<br>
of an intergovernmental commission, signed five accords, including one<br>
between the Slovak Economics Ministry and the Russia's Defense Industry<br>
Ministry. On the same day, representatives of the Slovak and Russian General<br>
Staffs signed an agreement to boost cooperation between their respective<br>
Defense Ministries. Slovak defense minister Jan Sitek also met with his<br>
Russian counterpart, Igor Rodionov. (TASR, November 23)<br>
<p>
NICHOLSON IS INDICTED. A federal grand jury has formally indicted CIA<br>
veteran Harold Nicholson on charges of conspiring to spy for Russia.<br>
According to the indictment, Nicholson delivered to Moscow "documents,<br>
photographic negatives, and information relating to the national defense."<br>
His espionage activities were said to have extended from June, 1994 to as<br>
recently as November 16 of this year. (Reuter, November 22) On November 20<br>
Nicholson's attorney said that his client would plead innocent to the spying<br>
charges. (AP, November 20)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
COMMUNISTS DENOUNCE RUSSO-CHECHEN AGREEMENT. The leader of the Russian<br>
Communist party, Gennady Zyuganov, has denounced the latest agreement signed<br>
by the prime ministers of Russia and Chechnya, saying it is unconstitutional<br>
and heralds the breakup of the Russian Federation. Zyuganov announced that<br>
the Communist faction in the Duma will call for a vote of no confidence in<br>
the government. He also likened the agreement to the 1991 Belovezhsky<br>
agreement that led to the break-up of the USSR. <br>
<p>
Details of the interim agreement, signed in Moscow on November 23 by Viktor<br>
Chernomyrdin and Aslan Maskhadov, have not been revealed. It is understood<br>
to cover the restoration of trade ties--including oil and gas deliveries --<br>
and the resumption of air, road, and rail links between Russia and Chechnya.<br>
The agreement also calls for coordinated action with regard to security, and<br>
the two sides promise not to take actions threatening each other. (NTV,<br>
Interfax, November 23; BBC World Service, November 24) <br>
<p>
Together with Yeltsin's decree on withdrawing the two brigades from Chechnya<br>
(see below), the prime ministers' agreement opens up a new era in Russia's<br>
Chechnya policy. After losing Chechnya politically, the Kremlin is trying to<br>
preserve its economic interests there. Above all, this means preserving the<br>
oil pipeline, which makes the "northern alternative" for transporting oil<br>
from Azerbaijan possible. It is also important to Moscow that the section of<br>
railroad that unites Dagestan with the rest of Russia through Chechnya be<br>
restored to normal functioning.<br>
<p>
TROOP WITHDRAWAL REMOVES MAIN STUMBLING BLOCK TO PEACE. Chernomyrdin and<br>
Maskhadov met in Moscow only hours after President Boris Yeltsin ordered the<br>
withdrawal of the last two brigades of federal forces from Chechnya. These<br>
are the 101st brigade of Interior Ministry forces and the 205th brigade of<br>
Defense Ministry troops. (RTR, Interfax, November 23) Ever since the signing<br>
of the Khasavyurt accords, the deployment of these units on Chechen<br>
territory has been the main stumbling block in negotiations between Grozny<br>
and Moscow. Yeltsin's decree is therefore being seen as a major concession<br>
and as evidence that Moscow has resigned itself to the existence of a<br>
de-facto independent Chechen state. <br>
<p>
According to Russian journalist Pavel Felgengauer, however, Russia's<br>
Ministry of Defense has been campaigning for the withdrawal since the<br>
summer, arguing that the troops had become sitting ducks that Moscow could<br>
not protect. For the army, last week's kidnapping of Russian soldiers by<br>
Chechen rebels was the last straw. But the Ministry of Internal Affairs<br>
opposed the withdrawal and argued that, once federal forces stop patrolling<br>
Chechnya's airports, the Russian heartland will be opened up to drugs and<br>
weapons smugglers. Felgengauer discounts this notion, pointing out that<br>
Russia is by no means powerless with regard to Chechnya. Russia controls<br>
Chechnya's airspace and the amount of aid coming into the republic and<br>
therefore retains considerable leverage over it, Felgengauer observes. He<br>
argues that the withdrawal of Russian troops will actually deprive the<br>
Chechens of one their strongest means of influencing Moscow. (BBC World<br>
Service November 23)<br>
<p>
DUMA CALLS ON YELTSIN TO SUSPEND AIDES PENDING INVESTIGATION OF TAPE. The<br>
Russian parliament has called on President Yeltsin to suspend from duty his<br>
chief-of-staff, Anatoly Chubais, and First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor<br>
Ilyushin, pending an investigation into allegations that the two were<br>
involved in covert funding of Yeltsin's presidential campaign and then tried<br>
to organize a cover-up when the affair came to light in June. (Interfax,<br>
November 22) The allegations spring from a transcript of a conversation that<br>
allegedly took place last June and that was published a week ago in the<br>
newspaper Moskovsky komsomolets. Chubais denies the conversation ever took<br>
place, but the consensus in the Russian media is that the transcript is<br>
genuine. Commentators doubt, however, that Yeltsin will act against his<br>
controversial chief-of-staff at present. Chubais is entirely dependent on<br>
Yeltsin for his position, but Yeltsin relies on Chubais for the construction<br>
of an efficient state machine. Commentators are unanimous in agreeing that<br>
Chubais has acquired unrivaled powers of administration with which Yeltsin<br>
cannot afford to dispense. <br>
<p>
Meanwhile, Russia's main military prosecutor has opened a criminal<br>
investigation into allegations that Yeltsin's former bodyguard, Aleksandr<br>
Korzhakov, destroyed official files after his ouster from the Kremlin in<br>
June. There is concern not only that Korzhakov destroyed documents but also<br>
that he absconded with incriminating information against other political<br>
leaders. The investigation is unlikely to get anywhere soon. Korzhakov has<br>
been registered as a candidate in the upcoming parliamentary by-election in<br>
Tula oblast, which gives him immunity from prosecution. (Interfax, November 22)<br>
<p>
THE TWO SIDES OF ALEKSANDR LEBED. Retired Russian general Aleksandr Lebed<br>
spoke on November 22 at the U.S.-Russia Business Council in Washington, DC.<br>
That same evening, an interview with Lebed was screened on the Jim Lehrer<br>
News Hour. Monitor correspondents who witnessed both events were struck by<br>
the contrast between them: speaking to businessmen, Lebed was optimistic and<br>
upbeat, but his TV appearance was pessimistic and gloomy. Addressing the<br>
businessmen, Lebed presented himself as a reasonable politician, open to<br>
contacts with American politicians and business people. He said the West has<br>
no need to fear either himself -- "I'm not a monster" -- or Russia. Lebed<br>
said he found Americans well-informed and ready for dialogue, and he looked<br>
forward to the day when "Russia will tear away her imperial mask and reveal<br>
her true, open, friendly face to a brave new world." He acknowledged that<br>
Russia must create favorable conditions for foreign and domestic investment,<br>
including reasonable tax, customs, and information policy, and he implied<br>
that if he were president, that would be the case. <br>
<p>
Lebed said he is "not hysterical" about NATO expansion and favors the<br>
construction of a stable security system. But he also argued that NATO<br>
should think carefully before incorporating states with inter-ethnic<br>
problems. NATO will have a bright future, Lebed said, if it changes its name<br>
and re-focuses on countering terrorism, drug trafficking, organized crime,<br>
and ecological threats. <br>
<p>
In his TV interview, Lebed painted a bleak picture of Russian reality. He<br>
said that Russia's economy and its army are falling apart, that one-third of<br>
Russia's territory is an ecological disaster, and that Russia's version of<br>
democracy is a sham. Seven out of every 10 schoolchildren have some disease<br>
or other, Lebed continued, while the president is too sick to govern and has<br>
left that task to Anatoly Chubais. And, while Lebed described himself as a<br>
democrat, he said he believed full democracy takes years to develop. Asked<br>
to label his political philosophy, Lebed replied simply, "National<br>
Pragmatism."  Monitor's correspondents detected that pragmatism in action as<br>
Lebed told the businessmen he welcomed their investment but, in response to<br>
a different type of question from his TV interviewer, made an entirely<br>
different case for his ascendancy to the presidency.<br>
<p>
THE BALTIC STATES<br>
<p>
RUSSIA, BELARUS LECTURE BALTS ON HUMAN RIGHTS. Addressing the UN General<br>
Assembly's Third Committee (which deals with human rights), Russia's UN<br>
ambassador, Sergei Lavrov, denounced Estonia and Latvia for "blatant<br>
violations of human rights" of their respective "Russian-speakers" and for<br>
failure to comply with OSCE standards in that area. Lavrov announced that<br>
Russia will shortly submit to the General Assembly a draft resolution on<br>
human rights violations in the two countries. <br>
<p>
During a visit to Latvia, meanwhile, the first deputy foreign minister of<br>
Belarus, Valery Tsyapkalo, publicly accused Latvia of "violating the human<br>
rights" of ethnic Belarusans. Tsyapkalo conceded that "democratization" of<br>
Latvia could eventually solve the problem. Both Lavrov and Tsyapkalo<br>
targeted legislation in Estonia and Latvia that falls short of naturalizing<br>
their respective settler populations en masse. (BNS, Interfax, November 22)<br>
<p>
The recently elected chairman of Latvia's parliament happens to be listed as<br>
an ethnic Belarusan. The Belarus embassy in Riga has recently been picketed<br>
by local ethnic Belarusans protesting against president Aleksandr<br>
Lukashenko's dictatorial ambitions. At the UN General Assembly, the U.S.<br>
last week signaled that it would oppose any resolution that would target the<br>
Baltic states for alleged violations of human rights.<br>
<p>
GOVERNMENT CRISIS IN ESTONIA. The Reform party's six ministers -- for<br>
foreign affairs, internal affairs, economics, transport and communications,<br>
education, and social affairs -- resigned from the Estonian government on<br>
November 22, following a party council's decision. Prime Minister Tiit Vahi<br>
and President Lennart Meri accepted the resignations. Vahi, whose Coalition<br>
party is the senior partner in the governing coalition, released Foreign<br>
Minister Siim Kallas from his post, effective immediately, while asking the<br>
other five outgoing ministers to continue as caretakers until a new<br>
government is formed. The Coalition party's Riivo Sinijarv has been<br>
appointed acting foreign minister.<br>
<p>
The government, comprised of the Coalition and Reform parties and the<br>
smaller Rural Union, has been in office for only 13 months. The Reform<br>
party, headed by Kallas, is considered the most consistent proponent of<br>
rapid market reforms among Estonia's major parties. <br>
<p>
Over the past few months, Vahi has publicly suggested that he can do better<br>
than Kallas in normalizing relations with Russia. Although Kallas had most<br>
recently worked with Vahi in making major concessions on the draft border<br>
agreement with Moscow, the Coalition party this month combined with the<br>
Center party and a Russian group to oust the Reform party and its allies at<br>
the head of Tallinn City Council. Vahi then signed an agreement with the<br>
Center party's leader, former prime minister Edgar Savisaar, opening the<br>
door for its inclusion in the government. Such a government would rest on a<br>
questionable majority. The Russian parliamentary group is negotiating its<br>
support in exchange for concessions on relations with Russia and on domestic<br>
policies. <br>
<p>
Savisaar, who is credited with engineering these realignments, had been<br>
ousted as internal affairs minister in October 1995 after being found<br>
responsible for illegal eavesdropping on senior politicians. He and his rump<br>
party have since been ostracized by responsible political forces, including,<br>
until now, Vahi and the Coalition party. (BNS, Radio Tallinn, Interfax,<br>
November 22-23)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
BELARUSAN PARLIAMENT GIVES THE RULE OF LAW ANOTHER CHANCE. The parliament of<br>
Belarus on November 22 and 23 refused to ratify the "compromise" deal with<br>
president Aleksandr Lukashenko that Russia's leaders had brokered in Minsk<br>
on the night of November 21-22. (See Monitor, November 22) A majority of the<br>
deputies agreed with those who condemned the deal as likely to guarantee the<br>
establishment of a presidential dictatorship. Stormy debates in parliament<br>
indicated that only some 60 of the 199 deputies supported the proposed deal.<br>
Parliament chairman Syamyon Sharetsky and Constitutional Court chairman<br>
Valery Tsikhinya followed the parliamentary majority and backtracked from<br>
the deal they had signed in the all-night talks under the pressure of<br>
Russia's leaders. <br>
<p>
The parliamentary majority agreed with the "zero option" under which it<br>
would stop impeachment proceedings against the president if the latter<br>
accepts that the constitutional referendum, which he expects would give him<br>
absolute powers, is to enjoy advisory status only. But the parliament<br>
rejected the heart of the "compromise," which would have sanctified the<br>
referendum by taking its result as the basis for a new constitution and<br>
which also would have created an unlawful "constitutional assembly" chaired<br>
by Lukashenko with a majority comprised of his supporters. <br>
<p>
Following the collapse of the deal, Lukashenko reinstated his decrees that<br>
had declared the referendum's result mandatory, while the parliament and<br>
Constitutional Court resumed impeachment proceedings against Lukashenko for<br>
prima facie violations of the law in issuing those and other decrees.<br>
(Belaplan, Interfax, NTV, November 22-24)<br>
<p>
Hasty endorsements of the November 22 deal by the British, German, and some<br>
other chancelleries, which treated the two sides to the deal as equivalent<br>
and focused on the "zero option" but ignored its negation in the following<br>
provisions, did not appear to sap the parliamentary majority's morale. Yet<br>
Western attitudes can still be crucial in tipping the political balance of<br>
power in Minsk one way or another.<br>
<p>
BELARUS IS (SOON TO BE) NUCLEAR FREE. While there has been some confusion<br>
about exact numbers and timing, the last Russian SS-25 mobile strategic<br>
nuclear missiles are apparently being withdrawn from Belarus. This means<br>
that President Aleksandr Lukashenko, who has hinted on several occasions<br>
that Minsk and Moscow might use the missiles as a bargaining chip in efforts<br>
to stop NATO's expansion into Eastern Europe, will fulfill his country's<br>
pledge to be nuclear-free by the end of the year. <br>
<p>
What many regarded as contradictory reports from Russian and Belarusan<br>
sources on the withdrawal might really have involved problems of definition.<br>
On November 22 sources in Belarus said that the last 14 of what had once<br>
been 96 Russian missiles would leave the country on November 26. Then, on<br>
November 23, the Russian Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF) press center<br>
announced that the last Russian nuclear warheads had been withdrawn from<br>
Belarus that day. Both accounts are probably true. The SRF would not move<br>
the missiles on their transporter-erector-launchers with their nuclear<br>
warheads installed, and could well have downloaded the warheads and shipped<br>
them back to Russia as announced. The missiles themselves would then cross<br>
the border separately. (Interfax-West, November 22; Interfax, November 23)<br>
<p>
CORRECTIONS: An item in the Monitor of November 22, citing an interview with<br>
Ingushetia's president Ruslan Aushev, mistakenly implied that Aushev<br>
expressed pessimism about Chechnya's economic prospects. In fact, that<br>
implication was editorial comment by the Monitor.<br>
<p>
The Monitor of November 22 incorrectly reported that Kazakhstan would soon<br>
begin presentation of a $100 billion eurobond issue. The amount should have<br>
read $100 million. <br>

<p>
YELTSIN AIDES UNDER INVESTIGATION. Russia's prosecutor general has ordered<br>
an investigation into charges of covert funding for Boris Yeltsin's<br>
presidential campaign. Among those to be questioned are past and present<br>
presidential aides Anatoly Chubais, Viktor Ilyushin and Aleksandr Korzhakov.<br>
(Itar-Tass, November 21) The charges arise out of last week's publication of<br>
a transcripted conversation in which Chubais admitted that two of his aides<br>
tried to smuggle $538,000 out of the Russian government building in June.<br>
Chubais has denied the charge.<br>
<p>
FUEL SHORTAGES THREATEN RUSSIA'S FAR EAST. Russia's Primorsky krai is facing<br>
a repeat of the energy shortages that plagued it during the summer -- this<br>
time with winter on the doorstep. The mayor of the town of Bolshoi Kamen has<br>
appeared on local TV to warn the population of 30,000 to pack a suitcase of<br>
basic essentials and be prepared for the possibility that the whole town may<br>
have to be evacuated. He appealed to the Russian government for help.<br>
(Interfax, November 22)<br>
<p>
SMALL INCREASE IN DEFENSE SPENDING PROPOSED. Russia's Defense Council<br>
recommended on November 20 that defense spending in Russia's 1997 state<br>
budget be raised by 6 trillion rubles. According to Council secretary Yuri<br>
Baturin, 4.4 trillion of that sum would be devoted to weapons development;<br>
1.6 trillion would be spent on food and uniforms. (Interfax, November 20)<br>
The government has proposed spending just over 100 trillion rubles on<br>
defense, far less than the 160 trillion requested by the Defense Ministry. <br>
<p>
U.S. BOTCHED GALKIN ARREST. A U.S. Justice Department official admitted<br>
yesterday that the CIA and FBI had bungled a recent case involving the<br>
arrest of Aleksandr Galkin, a former Soviet spy. The CIA had reportedly been<br>
informed but had not objected strenuously enough to block the FBI's plans to<br>
arrest Galkin. Subsequent protestations and threats of retaliation by Moscow<br>
forced the U.S. into an embarrassing retreat that resulted in Galkin's<br>
release. (Reuter, November 21) <br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FAR EAST BOOSTS TIES WITH JAPAN. The governor or Russia's Far<br>
Eastern Primorsky krai said on November 20 that Foreign Minister Yevgeny<br>
Primakov's recent visit to Tokyo has already begun to boost regional<br>
cooperation. According to Yevgeny Nazdratenko, a series of bilateral<br>
business-related accords were signed by Japanese and Russian regional<br>
leaders during a November 14 conference in Fukui. Conference participants<br>
also outlined plans for additional cultural and economic contacts.<br>

MOSCOW BACKS BOUTROS BOUTROS-GHALI. An unnamed senior Russian diplomat said<br>
yesterday that Moscow continues to back the reelection of Boutros<br>
Boutros-Ghali as UN secretary-general and may veto any other candidate put<br>
forward. The U.S., which has vigorously opposed Boutros-Ghali's<br>
reappointment, vetoed his candidature earlier this week. (Interfax, November 21)<br>
<p>
INDIANS INTERESTED IN RUSSIAN JET TRAINER. Soon after agreeing to buy<br>
Russian Su-30MK strike fighters, the Indian Air Force has expressed interest<br>
in the Mikoyan MiG-AT military trainer, according to Indian officials in New<br>
Delhi. Indian pilots were recently allowed to fly the new aircraft, which is<br>
competing with a Yakovlev trainer to replace Russia's aging Czech-built<br>
trainers. The MiG-AT is equipped with French engines. (Itar-Tass, November 21)<br>

RUSSIAN OFFICERS UNDER FIRE IN DUSHANBE. A Russian officer serving with<br>
Tajikistan's Defense Ministry, an officer and a soldier of Russia's<br>
"peacekeeping" troops, and two Russian officers' wives were shot in two<br>
incidents on November 19 and 20 in Dushanbe. The toll is 4 killed and one<br>
injured. The Russian command charged in a statement that the Tajik<br>
opposition has taken to "terrorizing" the Russian military. (Itar-Tass,<br>

<p>
KAZAKHSTAN TO LAUNCH EUROBOND ISSUE. Kazakhstan will begin the presentation<br>
of its $100 billion eurobond issue in the world's main financial centers on<br>
November 29. A preliminary presentation took place in London on November 12.<br>
Kazakhstan recently received its credit ratings from international credit<br>
agencies, which paved the way for the forthcoming eurobond issue. (Interfax,<br>

PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
FREE ECONOMIC ZONE IN CHECHNYA "NO PANACEA." The President of Ingushetia,<br>
Ruslan Aushev, has told the Monitor in an interview that, despite the<br>
creation of a Free Economic Zone (FEZ) in his republic, federal subsidies<br>
still constitute about 90 percent of Ingushetia's budget. The standard of<br>
living in Ingushetia is one of the lowest in Russia and unemployment<br>
approaches 50 percent. The 1991 separation of Chechnya and Ingushetia left<br>
Ingushetia, the more economically backward of the two, in an unenviable<br>
position, since almost all the industry and infrastructure were in Chechnya.<br>
The situation was further complicated in 1992 when 65,000 Ingush fled to<br>
Ingushetia from ethnic conflict in North Ossetia. In 1994 the federal<br>
authorities created a FEZ in Ingushetia. According to Mikhail Gutseriev,<br>
former head of Ingushetia's FEZ, about $200 million of federal money have<br>
been transferred there -- a huge sum for a republic with an estimated<br>
population of about a quarter million. (TV-6, November 17)<br>
<p>
Chechnya's situation today resembles that in Ingushetia before the creation<br>
of the FEZ, except that it is far worse. The Kremlin plans to restore<br>
Chechnya's economy by creating a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) there. Aushev<br>
says Chechnya will not agree to a FEZ defined by Russian law since,<br>
according to the Khasavyurt accords, the question of Chechnya's status is to<br>
be postponed for five years. But Chechnya's SEZ will differ from<br>
Ingushetia's FEZ only in name. Nonetheless, Aushev says Ingushetia's<br>
experience shows that a SEZ will not be a panacea for Chechnya's ills.<br>
According to Aushev, Ingushetia's FEZ will begin to pay off only in five<br>
years, and a turnaround will take even longer for Chechnya. In other words,<br>
there is no chance that the economy will revive before the expiry of the<br>
five-year period provided for in the Khasavyurt accords.<br>
<p>
RUSSIA PLANS CONTROVERSIAL TELECOMMS MERGER. The Russian government plans to<br>
offer one-quarter of Russian telecommunications shares (about $1 billion) to<br>
foreign investors next year. This will be done by merging two companies --<br>
Rostelekom and Svyazinvest -- to form a national telecommunications monopoly<br>
worth $4 billion. This will be the biggest issue of Russian equity to<br>
foreign investors so far, vastly exceeding the recent issue of 1.5 percent<br>
of Gazprom equity for $429 million. (Financial Times, November 15; Interfax,<br>
November 18-19) The Russian government owns 51 percent of Rostelekom and 100<br>
percent of Svyazinvest. Svyazinvest was created in 1992 in a deliberate<br>
effort to create a competitor for Rostelekom, which would otherwise have had<br>
a monopoly of the long-distance market.<br>
<p>
Now the government wants to merge the two companies to create a monopoly<br>
that will be attractive to investors and raise more money for the<br>
government. This means the government is putting the easement of its own<br>
budget problems ahead of the longer term goal of establishing an efficient<br>
and competitive telecommunications industry. The decision has upset World<br>
Bank officials, who say the planned merger will stifle competition. The<br>
World Bank has been working on privatization plans for Russia's<br>
telecommunications sector that would keep Svyazinvest and Rostelekom<br>
separate and allow the development of additional competitors in the<br>
long-distance and international markets. <br>
<p>
The British government made similar choices when it privatized major public<br>
utilities in the 1980s. It too sold enterprises as monopolies in order to<br>
boost government revenue and was criticized for failing to foster competition.<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
WITH MOSCOW'S HELP LUKASHENKO REAPS BLOODLESS TRIUMPH. Belarus president<br>
Aleksandr Lukashenko today signed with his main antagonists, parliament<br>
chairman Syamyon Sharetsky and Constitutional Court chairman Valery<br>
Tsikhinya, a political agreement designed to end the constitutional<br>
confrontation in Belarus. Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and the<br>
chairmen of Russia's Federation Council and Duma, Yegor Stroyev and Gennady<br>
Seleznev, mediated the agreement reached during all-night talks in Minsk. <br>
<p>
The agreement provides that the constitutional referendum, officially<br>
scheduled for November 24 but started by Lukashenko already on November 9,<br>
will be carried through to completion as Lukashenko desires. But its result<br>
will only be advisory, as the Constitutional Court and the parliament had<br>
resolved. The Court and parliament, in turn, will halt the impeachment<br>
proceedings that they had begun against Lukashenko because of his unlawful<br>
organization and conduct of the referendum. Within 20 days a Constituent<br>
Assembly comprised of 50 parliamentary deputies and 50 presidential<br>
appointees will convene in order to consider the president's and the<br>
parliament's constitutional drafts, and to adopt a new constitution based on<br>
the draft that receives more votes. This morning's agreement, presented as a<br>
"compromise" between president and parliament, was blessed by the Supreme<br>
Council of the Russia-Belarus Community, in the persons of Chernomyrdin,<br>
Stroyev, Seleznev, Lukashenko, and Sharetsky. (Itar-Tass, Western agencies,<br>
November 22)<br>
<p>
The agreement rescues Lukashenko from the pariah status that loomed<br>
following his defiance of 17 Constitutional Court verdicts invalidating<br>
presidential decrees. It accepts as valid, even if nonbinding, the results<br>
of a farcical referendum totally controlled by the president and one whose<br>
results had been dismissed in advance by all concerned -- including the<br>
Belarus parliament -- with the exception of Lukashenko and Moscow. It spells<br>
the end of the existing constitution, the main legal guarantee against<br>
presidential authoritarianism. It skews the Constituent Assembly's<br>
composition heavily in favor of Lukashenko,  preprogramming a substantial<br>
increase in Lukashenko's powers at parliament's expense. <br>
<p>
Today's agreement best suits Moscow's goal of ensuring Lukashenko's victory<br>
in a manner that does not appear undemocratic and that could place<br>
parliamentary leaders in the tow of Lukashenko's drive for "reintegration"<br>
with Russia. It could also complicate Western efforts to support<br>
pro-independence forces in the parliament, and is likely to split the<br>
coalition of establishment elements and extraparliamentary<br>
national-democratic groups that had coalesced in opposition to Lukashenko's<br>
policy.<br>
<p>
UKRAINIAN ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM. Ukraine and the IMF have reached<br>
agreement on an economic reform program. The plan includes a number of<br>
deregulation measures and tax cuts aimed at stimulating economic activity.<br>
According to Ukraine's Central Bank governor, Victor Yushchenko, the<br>
deregulatory package will affect some 97 laws and will provide for<br>
simplification of business registration and elimination of tax loopholes.<br>
Large spending cuts, however, will be delayed until next year, when the<br>
reduction of tax rates is expected to reduce budget revenues. Ukrainian<br>
deputy prime minister Viktor Pinzenik declared on November 19 that he is<br>
very pessimistic on the immediate prospects of increased budget revenues<br>
resulting from an expected expansion in business activity fueled by the tax<br>
cuts. <br>
<p>
The Ukrainian-IMF plan relies on foreign financing to achieve its targets.<br>
Ukraine expects to raise $1 billion at a meeting with Western donors in<br>
Washington next month. The IMF will provide additional financing in the form<br>
of a 3-year extended fund facility (EEF) $3.1 billion loan early next year.<br>
In addition, Ukraine plans to launch a eurobond issue, although the amount<br>
involved is a rather modest $200 million. Yushchenko, meanwhile, was hopeful<br>
that the domestic debt market might prove a significant source of revenue.<br>
According to the 1997 draft budget, $2.8 billion. should be obtained from<br>
bond sales. (Financial Times, November 19, Interfax, November 20) Those<br>
sales began in June 1995 and their role in covering the budget gap has been<br>
steadily increasing since then. However, central bank credits remain<br>
important; in the 1997 draft budget, bond sales and central bank credits<br>
have equal weight as a source of deficit financing. (Interfax, November 21) <br>
<p>
Pinzenik will present the 1997 draft budget and the tax reforms to Ukraine's<br>
Supreme Soviet today. The proposed reforms are likely to face opposition in<br>
parliament but it is expected that the combination of a larger budget<br>
deficit and the provision of external resources will finally win approval<br>
for the liberalization measures. The speaker of the Supreme Soviet,<br>
Aleksandr Moroz, declared on Monday that the deficit budget for 1997 can be<br>
"corrected" in the course of the parliamentary debate. He considers the<br>
growth of the deficit as necessary to pay wage debts, compensation for the<br>
erosion of the value of savings by inflation, and other social expenditures.<br>
According to Moroz, the current budget policy of the government is in<br>
accordance with the prescriptions of the IMF, and it is precisely this<br>
policy that is responsible for the fall in output and the non-payment of<br>
wages. (Interfax, November 19)<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
RUSSIA TO CUT TROOPS IN TRANSCAUCASUS; GEORGIA TO CAPITALIZE ON THE MEASURE.<br>
A senior official of Russia's Defense Ministry confirmed in general terms<br>
yesterday that Russia is making preparations to reduce its troops in Georgia<br>
and Armenia. A ministerial commission has been tasked to plan the cuts and<br>
define "optimal force levels" to be retained in the region. The commission's<br>
report is due by the end of the year. The reductions in the Transcaucasus<br>
form one aspect of Russia's broader military reform, the official said. <br>
<p>
In Tbilisi, the parliament's Defense and Security Commission chairman, Revaz<br>
Adamia, and the deputy foreign minister, Mikhail Ukleba, stated yesterday<br>
that Moscow is unable financially to maintain its current troop levels in<br>
Georgia. The officials nevertheless served notice that Moscow will be asked<br>
to pay rent for the use of military facilities in Georgia by the remaining<br>
Russian troops. Georgia will also claim the military equipment and other<br>
property of the troops earmarked for withdrawal, the officials stated. They<br>
singled out for criticism Russian border troops controlling the traffic<br>
across the Georgian-Turkish border -- an "absurd situation" which also<br>
jeopardizes plans to create the Eurasian transit corridor via Georgia.<br>
(Interfax, November 21) The timing of Moscow's measure favors Georgia's<br>
current effort to reduce the Russian military presence and take over some of<br>
the Russian troops' functions, particularly in guarding the country's<br>
borders. (See Monitor, November 21)<br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
OLD DEBTS POSTPONED AND NEW CREDITS GRANTED FOR KYRGYZSTAN. Payment of<br>
Kyrgyzstan's debt to Russia, totaling $132.8 million, has been deferred to<br>
2000-2009. The debt is be repaid in rubles, hard currency, exports of goods,<br>
or by the transfer of ownership rights over Kyrgyz assets to Russia. This<br>
debt is the result of loans granted by Russia to Kyrgyzstan since 1992.<br>
Between 1992 and the first half of 1993, credits were granted by the Russian<br>
Central Bank within the framework of the ruble area, and no clear terms of<br>
repayment were agreed upon. After the consolidation of these credits in<br>
mid-1993, redenominating their value in dollars and determining the terms<br>
and conditions of repayment, the provision of finance was done through state<br>
credits. These specified concrete terms of repayment, with variable interest<br>
rates, and were nominated in dollars. At the same time, Russia began to tie<br>
credits to the purchase of specific Russian goods, a practice which has<br>
continued. Thus, next year Kyrgyzstan will receive a $12 million credit from<br>
Russia for the restructuring of its energy sector. The credit is earmarked<br>
for the purchase of Russian equipment, with delivery to begin in 1997.<br>
Another $8 million has been assigned to the light industry and transport<br>
sectors. (Interfax, November 21)<br>
<p>
Russia was a crucial source of finance for Kyrgyzstan and other states of<br>
the former Soviet Union after they achieved their independence. However, a<br>
subsequent reduction of Russian loans to the region, as well as the<br>
increasing use of financial resources from Western countries and<br>
multilateral organizations, has diminished the importance of Russian<br>
credits. During a recent meeting of representatives of Central Asian and<br>
donor countries in Japan, Kyrgyzstan was offered $540 million in financial<br>
assistance. (Itar-Tass, November 1) Yesterday it was made public that<br>
Kyrgyzstan will receive a new long-term, low-interest $40 million credit<br>
from the Asian Bank of Reconstruction and Development to support the reform<br>
of industrial enterprises. (Interfax, November 21)<br>
<p>
U.S.-KAZAKH MEETING MAPS OUT BILATERAL COOPERATION. U.S. and Kazakh<br>
delegations, headed by Special Envoy James Collins and Foreign Minister<br>
Kasymjomart Tokayev, respectively, have completed in Almaty the third<br>
session of the U.S.-Kazakh intergovernmental committee. On this occasion the<br>
session was elevated to the status of a joint commission with an enhanced<br>
mandate. The committee conferred in four panels devoted to foreign policy<br>
and security, economics and trade, science and technology, and defense<br>
cooperation and defense industry conversion. The American side noted<br>
Kazakhstan's growing success in attracting foreign investments in general,<br>
and discussed further U.S. support for Kazakhstan's industrial<br>
privatization, creation of capital markets and a stock exchange, and<br>
infrastructure development. <br>
<p>
It was agreed to expand Kazakhstan's participation in NATO's partnership for<br>
Peace program and to hold military exercises within that framework in<br>
Kazakhstan in 1997. The U.S.-Kazakhstan joint committee was created in 1994<br>
under a partnership charter signed by Presidents Bill Clinton and Nursultan<br>
Nazarbayev, and meets twice annually. In talks with Nazarbayev on options<br>
for the transport of Kazakhstani oil and gas to international markets, the<br>
U.S. delegation supported planned pipeline routes via Turkey and via Russia.<br>
(Interfax, November 20)<br>
<p>
The Turkish route, in an incipient planning stage, entails transit via the<br>
Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, and will be discussed in detail by<br>
Nazarbayev with Turkish president Suleyman Demirel in Almaty next month. The<br>
Russian route, in an advanced planning stage but questionable in important<br>
respects, would pump oil from Kazakhstan's giant Tengiz field to Russia's<br>
Black Sea port Novorossiisk. It is supposed to be built by the Caspian<br>
Pipeline Consortium, with Western and Russian participation. Kazakhstan is,<br>
in addition, developing a route of smaller capacity by tanker and pipeline<br>
to Iran. <br>

"MASTER AND MAN" IN TODAY'S RUSSIA<br>
By Albert Speransky<br>
<p>
PART 2: THE WORKER<br>
(This is the second of three articles)<br>
<p>
The Psychology of the Hired Worker<br>
	The Soviet government spent a long time conducting experiments on human<br>
beings in an attempt to create a special "Communist breed of people," and<br>
one must confess that it achieved quite a bit in this endeavor.<br>
	In his struggle for self-preservation, the Soviet working man developed a<br>
certain flexibility of character. This flexibility, or, to put it more<br>
simply, lack of principle, is the mother of many human vices which surround<br>
us everywhere in our society: the inability to keep one's word,<br>
inconsistency, the capacity for betrayal. All of this comes from the fact<br>
that the working man has had, over the course of many years, to play a<br>
humiliating game, to adapt, above all, to the whims of powerful people,<br>
rather than to the requirements of the law. His "breeders" tried to<br>
inculcate these negative character traits in him, to make him more tractable. <br>
<p>
Who Exploits the Worker's Weaknesses?<br>
	The directors, as representatives of the totalitarian regime of the past,<br>
have a remarkable knowledge of their workers' weaknesses, and are able to<br>
exploit them with skill. The democrats, in beginning their reforms,<br>
developed a "composite psychological portrait" of the hired worker, and<br>
built their programs on the basis of this "identikit" picture. Reality did<br>
not conform to their ambitious plans, and their reforms "hung in midair."<br>
	The worker's most dangerous enemies are his own fearfulness, passivity,<br>
readiness to give way before stronger, more powerful people, and his<br>
complete legal and economic illiteracy. At the beginning of privatization,<br>
he elected people whom he never considered his friends, to represent his<br>
interests. They, in turn, sold him out and made him a hostage of the<br>
directors, and made him still more miserable and dependent. If noble "Robin<br>
Hoods," genuinely ready to help the worker, are few in number, there are<br>
more than enough agitators from the Communist propaganda machine in every<br>
labor collective. These are, for the most part, retired party and trade<br>
union activists -- a Communist "fifth column" in our society. Now, these<br>
people are quite aggressive and spiteful, and the economic crisis has put<br>
good cards in their hands. They are high-handed and inexorable in their<br>
arguments. Such agitation paralyzes the workers' will; people await reforms<br>
in fear and trembling, as they would the Last Judgment. For public<br>
consumption, the Communist agitators say that they wholeheartedly support<br>
reforms, but in reality, they are fervent opponents of reforms, and incite<br>
the workers against the people who set them in motion. They drum it into the<br>
workers' heads that all their misfortunes are the result of an evil plot on<br>
the part of the government, the Americans, the democrats, and the Jews.<br>
	Recently, the Communists and the national-patriots have begun to present<br>
themselves as the saviors of the nation, and its moral values. They argue<br>
that, with the beginning of reform, the deformation of the Russian national<br>
character began to take place, and its moral standards began to decline.<br>
	Of course, much has happened recently which is offensive to the workers;<br>
their characters have been sorely tested. The extreme situation has forced<br>
these negative traits back into the foreground. The seeds of these traits<br>
were scattered liberally back in Soviet times. Therefore, on many questions,<br>
I want to take the pre-reform year of 1989 as my point of departure. At that<br>
time, I published an article in Literaturnaya gazeta, entitled "Who Speaks<br>
for the Workers?" I got a lot of letters back from readers. Clearly, I must<br>
have struck a responsive chord; people began to pour out their hearts to me.<br>
Their letters, for the most part, spoke of how totalitarianism had broken<br>
the character of the working man. The authors of these letters turned to me<br>
as someone who shared their views and they strengthened my article with<br>
factual examples, which have allowed me, from time to time, to cite thoughts<br>
from these letters, which have become my own as well.<br>
<p>
Aggressive Dependence<br>
	Hired workers today have absolutely no idea what is going on with property,<br>
where the country is headed, or where they are being driven like a herd of<br>
sheep. These naive people, not long ago, sincerely believed that reforms<br>
would be accomplished "from the top down". Long habit made them fear<br>
responsibility for making decisions, hide behind each other's backs, and<br>
look for a "kamikaze" to take the risk for them. If they found a<br>
conscientious, selfless person in the collective, they would "cry on his<br>
shoulder," complain about how bad things were, supply him with information,<br>
bring him wild rumors of violations committed by the administration. Step by<br>
step, they would encourage him to step forward to defend his co-workers. And<br>
such a "lover of truth" would quickly fall out of management's good graces.<br>
In front of everyone, they would begin to humiliate and destroy him. And no<br>
one would come to his aid. I myself, working in a factory, have gotten into<br>
this kind of situation many times. I have felt the effect of this machine of<br>
suppression, which is built into the structure of every labor collective,<br>
with my own skin. It was on the basis of personal experience that I wrote in<br>
my mutinous article: "A whole army would be amassed against this poor "lover<br>
of truth" at his factory: the trade union committee, a hired lawyer, and the<br>
State, in the form of the judge's bench, adorned with the national seal. The<br>
administration itself picked assistants, the so-called "collective<br>
authority" which would carry out any of its master's requests, and served as<br>
his hands and fingers, to strangle any dissent." To bear this out, I will<br>
cite one of the examples sent to me.<br>
	"My foreman defended workers' rights single-handedly. He was the one the<br>
workers would go to for help. The bosses decided to stop the 'troublemaker.'<br>
They began to make a trumped-up case against him. People from the<br>
administration with an ax to grind ostensibly 'caught him drunk during<br>
working hours.' But it was strange: nobody went to his supervisor. Nobody<br>
told him that he was violating work discipline. Nobody forced him, while he<br>
was still drunk, to undergo a medical examination. After finishing his<br>
shift, the foreman walked out quietly through the gate, and the guards<br>
didn't notice anything strange in his behavior. And then, the very next day,<br>
like a bolt from the blue, a directive appeared, which accused him of having<br>
been drunk on the job. The day of his supposed drunkenness was counted as<br>
'unexcused absence.' He was deprived of his bonus (one thirteenth of his<br>
annual salary), sent to work on a lower paying job for three months. On top<br>
of that, he was sent to work on a construction site for a month. They<br>
rescheduled his vacation for the winter. He was the chairman of the Council<br>
of Foremen--they removed him. He was a member of the Labor Council--they<br>
removed him without even holding a meeting first. In a word, they dragged<br>
his name through the mud. Those whom he protected and defended, seeing the<br>
outrage that was being committed against this man, remained criminally<br>
silent, and avoided looking him in the eye." <br>
	This letter was written by lathe operator Merzlyakov, from Izhevsk. There<br>
was a return address on the letter, but no first name. Clearly he was afraid<br>
to go through with it, to reveal himself completely.<br>
	This example shows the labor collective acts as a "provocateur," exploiting<br>
the courage of an individual until the administration decides to punish him.<br>
Then, everyone turns away from their "savior." One may call this group<br>
dependence. This benefits the bosses most of all, because it helps them<br>
single out and annihilate individual leaders.<br>
	The story about the foreman from Izhevsk, who was shunned like the plague<br>
by his co-workers in his hour of need and left to be torn apart by the<br>
administration -- took place back in 1989. Now, that seems like a completely<br>
different epoch. Seven years have gone by since then. What has changed in<br>
the character and the mentality of the working man? The following incident<br>
took place at the construction site of the Zeya Hydroelectric Plant in the<br>
fall of 1995. The workers had not been paid in four months. After exhausting<br>
all other means of influencing the administration, in an emergency meeting<br>
of the labor collective, 19 people wrote out a statement that, being of<br>
sound mind, they would begin a hunger strike until all the workers at the<br>
site received their back pay. The collective gave them the go-ahead and<br>
applauded them as heroes and their defenders. But the very next day, they<br>
unexpectedly began to distance themselves from their "heroes." Each worker,<br>
individually, feared appearing on the bosses' list of "malcontents." Only<br>
after a week, when most of the hunger strikers could no longer lift<br>
themselves from their beds, did they begin to gather signatures on a<br>
petition to support them.<br>
	The bosses took these psychological nuances into account, and at the proper<br>
time, drove in a wedge between the strikers and the rest of the collective.<br>
For a long time, the strikers didn't give in; they held on, sacrificing<br>
their health, for the sake of the collective. But when they finally<br>
understood that they had been betrayed and left to face the administration<br>
alone, on the 14th day of their strike, they gave in and agreed to receive<br>
back pay only for themselves, and called off the hunger strike, and the<br>
4,500 other workers on the site were left with nothing. In their desire to<br>
"hedge their bets," the workers had only deceived themselves. But now they<br>
look at the protesters with resentment, holding them to blame for their lost<br>
back pay. Such incidents take place time and time again in the labor<br>
collectives. That's what the Communists' vaunted "collectivism" really means<br>
in practice.<br>
	But one must admit that a certain sort of collectivism is present in<br>
Russian society, and was carefully nourished. It is what I would call<br>
"aggressive collectivism," when people get together behind a force in order<br>
to settle accounts with their enemies. This requires the constant presence<br>
of "enemies." If there are none, as the adage goes, they have to be<br>
invented. Soviet society needed enemies in order to function normally. The<br>
strong usually harassed the weak. A special part of society, the labor<br>
collective, was set aside for this purpose. Ordinary people were afraid to<br>
be among the "weak," or even worse, "alone," in their opinions. In the best<br>
case, they kept silent, but in general, they tried as hard as they could to<br>
curry favor with the "strong." This proceeded from a deep-seated terror of<br>
those in power. In every labor collective, there was an army of sycophants<br>
which could be set against the necessary object if the need arose. Nowadays,<br>
they use these tactics to fight against free trade unions, which are still<br>
weak and in the embryonic state. The directors continue to use the ideology<br>
of Communist society, and cleverly exploit this aggressive collectivism.<br>
	The psychology of the workers has not yet changed. And in all likelihood,<br>
it will not change until the structure of the collective itself changes,<br>
until the socialist system of suppression within it is destroyed.<br>
<p>
The Workers' Leaders<br>
	Whom can the workers rely on in the labor collective? The leaders, whose<br>
authority in the collective was formed in former times, are now about 40<br>
years old. They have families, and are already established specialists. But<br>
unfortunately, most of them are products of the Communist party, albeit not<br>
from its most fanatical core. The ideas of Communist ideologues have taken<br>
root in their souls. The party tried especially hard to recruit people who<br>
had organizational skills, who were trusted in the collective. And people<br>
who had these talents were forced to join the party. Only there could they<br>
find a way to use these talents. The old, Soviet, method of [trade union<br>
work] was drummed into their heads: "talk more, do less."<br>
	Such people keep their cards to their chests, and always have a "plan B" in<br>
reserve in case things don't work out, which could prove ruinous to those<br>
who trust them. After organizing the workers into a protest action, the<br>
leader often begins to "maneuver," to become a buffer between the labor<br>
collective and the administration. Such a leader will deliberately drag<br>
things out, and wait until people cool down and understand that there is no<br>
future in acting against the administration. He sits, as it were, on two<br>
chairs: he doesn't want to lose his authority with the workers, tries to<br>
guide their mood, and at the same time, is in no hurry to quarrel with the<br>
administration. But in spite of all these "minuses," you still have to rely<br>
on such leaders. There isn't much of a choice: there is as yet no "new wave"<br>
of organizers in the factories. Young people have almost stopped working in<br>
these enterprises; it is almost impossible to persuade them to work there.<br>
And the old "malcontents," who didn't want to live under the party's thumb,<br>
those who acted, in spite of the risk and their own fear, have been rooted<br>
out. Just like that foreman from Izhevsk. As they used to say: "He who is<br>
not with us is against us."<br>
	But if you look hard, you will still find some democratically-inclined<br>
leaders in the collective. True, they aren't always ready to take active<br>
measures, for they know that such steps will be fruitless in the present<br>
situation. There is no legal support for these activists and their ideas.<br>
The labor legislation hardly works at all. And without firm guarantees of<br>
security, who will support them in the collective?<br>
	Feeling no "feedback," these leaders have begun to leave the industrial<br>
enterprises. These workers, who have great creative potential, do not want<br>
to get stuck in socialist-style serfdom. They set off, one by one, for a new<br>
life, in private commercial structures. As a result, most independent<br>
workers' groups, which strove for a reorganization of our enterprises into<br>
civilized market structures, have begun to disintegrate. The collectives are<br>
thus deprived of the people who could unite people behind them and generate<br>
ideas. Most of those who remain are unskilled workers, members of the<br>
lumpenproletariat, who, by their very nature, are not creators, but<br>
destroyers and extremists. There are also many leaders in this lower<br>
stratum, who, for the most part, fight for equal pay for everyone<br>
[uranilovka]. They are easily susceptible to the Communists' calls for riots<br>
or revolution.<br>
	These leaders also come from the socialist past. Every shop, every<br>
construction site, every crew has at least one such semi-anarchist. You can<br>
call them "loudmouths." They have learned that they can get what they want<br>
this way, not only for themselves, but also for the weaker ones whom they<br>
have taken under their wing. The bosses tolerate these anarchists because<br>
they are useful to them; with their shouting and illogical actions, they<br>
wipe out the first shoots of democratic sentiment among the workers.<br>
	These leaders are alive and well today, and are the main ringleaders in any<br>
extremist actions. There are quite a few of them. Many have already<br>
appeared, and others are biding their time. Their most distinctive trait is<br>
their ability to stir up the passions of a mob.<br>
	For example, this is what happened at the Kimry machine tool factory in the<br>
Tver oblast. The "old" trade union had long ceased to represent the workers,<br>
and did not even react to their cries of alarm. Salaries were not being<br>
paid, while there was enough money in the factory's coffers to continue<br>
construction on cottages for the director and his close associates. The<br>
workers were furious, they cursed, but only in dark corridors and smoking<br>
rooms. But one day, they started grumbling right on the shop floor. One by<br>
one, the workers left their posts, and gathered together in one contentious<br>
crowd. The crowd grew, and an angry meeting began. Nobody knew of a way to<br>
make things better, either at the factory, or in the country. Passions<br>
heated up. And then, from one of the back rows, someone cried out: "Let's<br>
grab them right now, when they're not expecting it, right in their offices."<br>
That was enough. The crowd began to arm itself with iron rods and sticks.<br>
About 300 people were ready to take over not only the factory administration<br>
offices, but the whole city. Only a miracle stopped the rabid crowd. A few<br>
workers blocked their way, and began to talk them out of it. But they<br>
weren't able to talk them out of it completely; that night, some unknown<br>
"heroes" still set fire to the director's cottage.<br>
 	Can there be anything more terrifying than that uncontrollable crowd? The<br>
absence of a consistent, civilized effort to defend the workers' interests<br>
will lead to just such elemental outbreaks of emotion, to such riots in the<br>
collective, and to situations where the workers will listen to anyone. The<br>
departure of democratic leaders from the collectives greatly increases the<br>
chances of such riots. This has been a gift to the Communists, incendiary<br>
material in their hands, which they know quite well how to use.<br>
<p>
Reforms and the Hired Worker<br>
	Reforms in our country have become distorted. And can it really be any<br>
other way in a society with so many psychological complexes and with such a<br>
deep-rooted system of feudal subordination?<br>
	A very interesting situation has taken shape in the production sphere. The<br>
directors have abandoned their socialist way of life. They have become<br>
proprietors, but at the same time, they are trying to keep their employees<br>
captivated by the socialist mirage. This enables the directors to act on<br>
their employees through the labor collective, to direct them, as it were,<br>
through the "serf community," and prevent them from becoming psychologically<br>
ready for a market economy. At the same time, the directors can be the<br>
"guardians" of their "underage children" (labor collectives, hired<br>
employees). And while these "children" are still "maturing," property<br>
remains uncontrolled; it can be stolen, or simply gradually appropriated.<br>
	Nowadays, many enterprises, and entire branches of industry, are going to<br>
pieces. Directors have stopped managing production and have become<br>
shopkeepers. They sell off buildings, equipment, and "sell" the production<br>
of their enterprise to other directors, knowing full well that no payment<br>
will ever be made. (This was discussed in the first part of this article.)<br>
The true producers, the hired workers, have been deprived of a great deal of<br>
public (state) property. This economic policy of ignoring an enterprise's<br>
future for the sake of short-term profit has left many workers unemployed.<br>
Many of them, now on "compulsory furloughs" still have the faint hope that<br>
their jobs will be there when they come back. Others have nothing left to<br>
hope for -- they have no chance of getting their jobs back. People are<br>
afraid of losing their jobs. But how could it be otherwise? The old<br>
enterprises are closing down, and no new ones have appeared. People are<br>
hanging onto their jobs by their teeth, groveling before their bosses,<br>
voluntarily renouncing any human rights, and half-starving, heroically<br>
endure delays in their wages.<br>
	"If the director needs to have his apartment repaired -- we go. If we have<br>
to build the boss a new garage -- we go. If we're not slaves, who is?"<br>
Dmitri Karpov, locksmith and mechanic, Krasnodar.<br>
	This is the most infuriating consequence of the half-hearted reforms in our<br>
economy, which the Communists and nationalist play on like strings. And<br>
quite successfully. The recent elections to the State Duma attest to this.<br>
	Perhaps the workers are also to blame for not putting up a fight during<br>
privatization, but nobody even tried to get them involved or organize them.<br>
The reformers themselves trusted the directors. As a result, strong,<br>
powerful people, manipulating our imperfect laws before the eyes of innocent<br>
people, promising them mountains of gold under privatization, have left the<br>
workers holding the bag. Whose blame is that? They wanted to transfer<br>
property to private owners as soon as possible, to crush the state's<br>
monopoly. But they paid for it by losing the trust of the common people,<br>
making them their ideological opponents. It will cost a lot now to regain<br>
their trust.<br>
<p>
The Present Government and the Hired Worker<br>
	The present government, which calls itself democratic, was formed out of<br>
"bricks" from the former nomenklatura, of the same well-known officials who,<br>
not long ago, had tried to build "socialism with a human face." These people<br>
have close friendship, and kinship, ties. As soon as one of them reaches the<br>
top, he starts trying to pull up the whole "nomenklatura chain." This is how<br>
elites are formed in this country to the tune of democratic slogans. No<br>
matter how we curse them, no matter how we annihilate them with words, they<br>
are still there at the top. They are a ruling caste, which will not turn the<br>
state over to anybody else. The working man, and his long-suffering<br>
existence means no more to them than a Sunday game of tennis.<br>
	And the spectacle of the President ("elected by nationwide vote") "going to<br>
the people in search of truth," looks funny and staged. The fact is that the<br>
President's "truth" is prepared for him by his entourage and by local<br>
officials; the very same nomenklatura stratum hand-picks the people allowed<br>
to talk to him. When Yeltsin visited the Rostselmash factory in Rostov, the<br>
factory administration simply barred free trade union representative<br>
Vladimir Borisov from entering the plant for his shift. He only managed to<br>
get in after the meeting in which Yeltsin participated was over and the<br>
president had been told the "director's truth," and not the "workers'<br>
truth." The "two truths" differ significantly. The "director's truth" is<br>
often detrimental to the country; it destroys it. This is clear from the<br>
results of the recent reforms.<br>
	But where can new politicians be found, who would be able to care for<br>
ordinary people? There are no new leaders on the political Olympus, just as<br>
they are absent from the labor collective. Must we endlessly await the<br>
nomenklatura's mercy? The necessary laws could be passed, but there is no<br>
one to see that they are enforced. Only social processes can bring new<br>
people to the top. And these processes must begin from the grass roots.<br>
People who are now afraid to organize must think, above all, for their<br>
children and grandchildren. If they don't act, they will doom their children<br>
to a bad life for many years to come. If workers learn how to defend<br>
themselves, and get protection in the form of independent trade unions, then<br>
their psychology will begin to change as well. They will build a new moral<br>
house, in which their children and grandchildren will live in the future.<br>
The worker today is upset, because he feels alone, driven into a corner, and<br>
has no one to trust. With his family and friends around him, he unwinds,<br>
becomes completely different, but as soon as he goes back to work, he is<br>
once again without rights, and therefore, bitter.<br>
	As difficult as it may be, it is necessary to persuade this man that<br>
democracy in any country begins on the shop floor. And no matter how hard we<br>
try, we won't be able to build the American form of democracy on the basis<br>
of our labor collectives. We must be bold enough to demolish these<br>
fortresses of feudalism.<br>
	So far, the working man has experienced only one form of democracy -- the<br>
ballot. With that ballot, he has become a "fighter by correspondence." The<br>
desire to solve problems at the workplace, to take revenge on those who<br>
insult him, i.e., the directors, with the ballot could lead to a return to<br>
the charms of the totalitarian regime, in one of its many guises -- fascism.<br>
The "iron hands" which the workers are calling on to impose order won't<br>
stand on ceremony. They will impose order. And they will snatch the ballot<br>
out of the unreliable hands of the hired worker, or at the very least, will<br>
make it not worth the paper on which it is printed.<br>
	So that's what our working man is like. A great man once said: "Don't fear<br>
your friend: a friend can only betray you. Don't fear your enemy: he can<br>
only kill you. Be afraid of the indifferent man: he can betray you, or sell<br>
you, or kill you, for his ways are unfathomable."<br>
	But to change his ways, the worker needs to believe in something, see<br>
something ahead of him, and enjoy certain guarantees. Unfortunately, nobody<br>
gave him such faith when the reforms were launched. General statements about<br>
market transformations and financial stabilization do not touch his heart.<br>
The hired worker, from his own bitter experience, knows what such<br>
declarations are worth. Reshuffling at the top in the search for guilty<br>
parties is nothing but a "king's sport." In the production sphere, a more<br>
serious hunt is taking place -- and the worker is the quarry.<br>
	The new labor relations are incompatible with the old style of management.<br>
A new model is needed.<br>

WILL RUSSIA GET A "SMARTER" TAX POLICY?<br>
By Lidia Lukyanova<br>
<p>
	If Russia succeeds in solving the problem of collecting taxes from all<br>
persons and legal entities on its territory, the need for foreign loans,<br>
according to experts of the Russian chamber of commerce, will disappear.<br>
	Why then is the problem of uncollected taxes getting steadily worse?<br>
	In recent months, the tax burden for legal entities has become even<br>
heavier: of every million rubles earned by businesses, up to 950,000 rubles<br>
go to taxes and other fees. The demands on small businesses have gotten<br>
tougher, although small business is the only part of the economy that is<br>
actually increasing its production of goods and services. The government is<br>
limiting local tax exemptions, making calculation of the costs of production<br>
more complicated. In other words, the straw on which enterprises used to<br>
hang as many expenses as possible, in order to lower their taxable profit,<br>
has disappeared. And if paying taxes leaves a business in a desperate<br>
situation, the law will encourage people to look for ways to get out of<br>
paying their taxes completely.<br>
	In fact, businesses in Russia are getting better and better at avoiding<br>
paying taxes on their profit. And as strange as it may seem, this is done<br>
strictly within the law, so that even the tax police can't find fault with<br>
it. And this is the main paradox.<br>
	There is also a second paradox. In Russia, the government and the State<br>
Duma are each pulling the tax "rope" in their own direction. The<br>
government--towards making taxes tougher in the interests of filling the<br>
treasury's coffers, and the deputies, towards lightening the tax burden.<br>
Russia's present tax system was created in 1992 and over the past four<br>
years, the original package of tax legislation, which formed the base of<br>
this system, has  been reexamined several times. This has given rise to<br>
instability and confusion as to the rules of the game, especially with<br>
businesses and organizations. Moreover, the frequent amendments and<br>
additions to the tax laws are dictated, as a rule, by the immediate needs of<br>
an empty treasury, and not by a far-sighted policy to revive the country's<br>
economy. This explains the fact that the taxes on legal entities are getting<br>
more and more strict, while the determination to avoid paying them grows<br>
ever stronger. In Moscow, at the beginning of this year, the tax police<br>
exposed 29,000 tax evaders, whose total debt to the treasury amounted to<br>
three trillion rubles.<br>
	By law, the government may only establish the types of taxes and fees which<br>
have been enumerated in the law "On the Principles of the Tax System." But,<br>
in fact, the ingenuity of the local tax authorities in the krais, oblasts,<br>
and cities is boundless. For example, in the Moscow oblast, you have to pay<br>
a tax for participating in horse races at the Hippodrome. In 22 raions in<br>
the Moscow oblast, there are now fees for holding auctions and lotteries,<br>
which are nothing but taxes under a different name. And there is also a tax<br>
for the development of physical culture and sport, and a tax for the upkeep<br>
of educational institutions has been introduced at the oblast level.<br>
	This ingenuity on the part of the local authorities became possible after<br>
Presidential Decree No. 2268 "On the Formation of Budgets of Subjects of the<br>
Russian Federation in 1994" was issued on December 22, 1993. This decree<br>
(point 7) gave organs of federation subjects the right to impose new taxes<br>
and fees on their territory, in addition to those enumerated in the law "On<br>
the Principles of the Tax System." These they imposed without hesitation.<br>
And this is the third paradox: it is impossible to define all the taxes and<br>
fees which have been imposed in Russia, just as it is impossible to say<br>
exactly which taxes enterprises in the various regions are required to pay.<br>
Such a situation is clearly not conducive to the stability of Russia's tax<br>
system, and it is this factor which is one of the most important ones for<br>
foreign investors. At any moment, a businessman could be faced with the fact<br>
that a regional government has imposed a new tax. This completely destroys<br>
the businessman's economic calculation, which led him to put his business in<br>
the region in the first place.<br>
	According to the law, "On the Principles of the Tax System," the repeal of<br>
taxes and fees, and also the introduction of tax exemptions, and all changes<br>
in the tax structure can be implemented only through legislation. The tax<br>
provisions contained in "non-tax laws" come into force only when they are<br>
reflected in special tax legislation. This strict approach to the regulation<br>
of tax legislation is justified because any tax provision, in one way or<br>
another affects the revenue side of the budget, and thus affects the<br>
property interests of the taxpayers.<br>
	But this wise rule does not cover the Russian president's own "tax<br>
creativity," although according to existing legislation, the president does<br>
not have the right to impose taxes, in the absence of extraordinary<br>
circumstances such as martial law. Nevertheless, the president issued a<br>
decree (No. 65, January 19, 1996) "On Offering Businesses and Organizations<br>
Extensions on their Tax Debts, Penalties and Fines for Violations of Tax Law<br>
Dating from before January 1, 1996." According to Article 10 of the law "On<br>
the Principles...", an extension is a form of tax exemption which can be<br>
implemented only by law. Where does that leave people who have been fined?<br>
That's one side of the question, the other is -- has anyone counted how much<br>
money will be lost while this extension is in force? After all, what<br>
delinquent will pay his fines and debts while there is still an extension?<br>
Such a paradoxical legal free-for-all, with the tax rope being pulled in<br>
three different directions -- by the government, the State Duma, and the<br>
president, leaving the tax service and the taxpayer guessing as to which one<br>
to listen to -- could be possible only in Russia. But the taxpayer<br>
interprets all of the paradoxes of the legal situation to his own benefit,<br>
proceeding (just like the state) from the standpoint of immediate benefit.<br>
And the fact that there won't be a penny in the state treasury tomorrow,<br>
well, that's tomorrow. You've got to live through today first...<br>
<p>
The Types of Taxes Collected from "Physical" Persons<br>
	Russians pay an income tax, a property tax, and a tax on property received<br>
by inheritance or as a gift. And also a tax on the purchase and sale of real<br>
estate.<br>
	The Income Tax. This tax is paid on gross annual income, received over the<br>
course of the calendar year. The rates are as follows: on an annual income<br>
of up to 12 million rubles, the marginal tax rate is 12 percent; from 12 to<br>
24 million rubles, it is 20 percent; from 24 to 36 million, 25 percent; and<br>
the rate grows to 35 percent for incomes which exceed 48 million rubles.<br>
	Taxes on the Property of "Physical" Persons. This tax is imposed on a<br>
person's house, apartment, means of transportation, automobiles,<br>
motorcycles, motorboats, cutters, helicopters, or airplanes. The tax rate is<br>
defined in terms of a percentage of the minimum wage in effect on the date<br>
the tax is calculated.<br>
	Taxes on the Purchase and Sale of Real Estate. In Russia, the number of<br>
people who own real estate is growing but the state is fleecing private<br>
property owners with its taxes. For example, 30 percent of the market price<br>
of an apartment is "eaten up" in taxes when you sell it. Thus, in the sale<br>
of a three-room apartment, one room goes to pay the taxes. It is possible to<br>
catch and fine taxpayers for concealing part of their income from the sale<br>
of their apartments, but the unreasonably excessive rate forces them to<br>
commit this crime. As a result, courts all over the country are full of<br>
people being tried for "machinations" in the buying and selling of housing. <br>
	In the opinion of the head of the Moscow branch of the State Tax Service,<br>
Dmitri Chernik, property tax legislation poses nothing but problems, since<br>
it holds everything absolutely equal. For example, the law treats all sales<br>
of apartments and dachas equally. But it is one thing when a firm or an<br>
individual is in the real estate business, a form of commercial activity,<br>
which brings in income, and it is a completely different thing when the<br>
owner of a dacha or an apartment sells it in order to improve his material<br>
position or his living conditions.<br>
	In defining the tax on selling real estate, the Russian government, in<br>
Chernik's opinion, ought to proceed from the principle of the sale of<br>
personal real property. If it is sold for personal necessity, then this<br>
transaction ought to be exempt from tax, or the rate should be minimal. This<br>
is accepted practice in many countries in the world, but Russia is still in<br>
the thrall of Soviet-style egalitarianism [uranilovka].<br>
	Inheritance and Gift Taxes.  This tax is imposed on houses, apartments,<br>
dachas, garden cottages, all types of vehicles, antiquities and art objects,<br>
jewelry, deposits in financial institutions, foreign currency, and the cash<br>
value of securities.<br>
	It is calculated in rates which depend on the cost of the property, and<br>
range from five to 40 percent.<br>
<p>
Taxes on Legal Entities<br>
	If one takes into account not only the direct taxes which businesses pay --<br>
taxes on profit and value-added taxes, -- there are also a multitude of<br>
indirect taxes, beginning with customs duties and taxes on the land occupied<br>
by a business, and licensing fees, patent fees, and other fees. The main<br>
(federal) taxes on businesses are a 35 percent tax on profit (income) and a<br>
20 percent value-added tax. In short, that's already 55 percent that you<br>
have to give the state. But that's not all that they extort from you.<br>
Another 40 or 45 percent gets taxed away by various local authorities. As a<br>
result, many businesses don't even have enough money left to meet the<br>
payroll. A businessman must either resign himself to the fact that<br>
increasing production will remain only a dream, or trick the government, so<br>
that he can save part of his income from the tax man.<br>
	In the drive to fulfill its short-term need to fill the budget, government<br>
at every level is chopping off the branch it sits on, by increasing the<br>
already unbearable tax burden on businesses.<br>
	Small businesses, who, as everyone knows, are the only ones who can save<br>
the economy, waited with hope for a tax exemption promised by the<br>
government. After the law "On the Simplification of the Tax System,<br>
Accounting, and Liability for Small Businesses," went into effect, taxes on<br>
small business were calculated on the basis of total income alone.<br>
	The following rates were established: 10 percent of total taxable income to<br>
the federal budget; no more than 20 percent to the budget of the federation<br>
subject and the local budget. In sum, a tax of 30 per cent of total taxable<br>
income. It looked wonderful but something was fishy in such an enormous<br>
reduction.<br>
	Will the new law lighten the burden on small business? Will it introduce a<br>
more reasonable principle into tax policy? Independent experts of the<br>
Russian Chamber of Commerce do not believe that the Ministry of Finance can<br>
propose such a large reduction in the tax burden. A closer study of the tax<br>
rates quoted above confirms this sad proposition.<br>
	If the single tax rate were calculated only on an enterprise's profit, then<br>
30 percent could be seen as a reduction. But when the taxes are calculated<br>
on the basis of total income, the law includes the money which goes to<br>
paying workers' salaries as well, which increases the tax base. What a<br>
"privilege"!<br>
	What the government calls "simplification of accounting and liability" for<br>
small business actually makes businessmen's' lives much more complicated.<br>
Now the quarterly income reports have to be accompanied, not by a balance<br>
sheet, but by all possible financial documentation: ledgers, cash books,<br>
payment orders... Every time you pay the tax, you have to go through a<br>
complete audit by the Tax Service, which used to be an extremely rare<br>
occurrence. Some accountants openly say that such audits make it harder for<br>
small firms to carry on their work in the "shadow economy," which, of<br>
course, does not make it any easier for them to survive, but only strangles<br>
them.<br>
	Thus, the new law does not provide any protection to small business. Boris<br>
Altshuler and Viktor Sokiro, experts at the Moscow Research Center on Human<br>
Rights, are much harsher in their assessment of the law: "The hopes of small<br>
business have been deceived, for the suggestions of small business owners<br>
were only given lip service, and have not, in fact, been accepted."<br>
	And businessmen themselves, in discussing the new law at the Russian<br>
Association to Support Small Business, said that it was better to hide from<br>
the Tax Inspectorate and pay off the racketeers than to live in eternal and<br>
humiliating slavery to government bureaucrats. And if the state really wants<br>
to come to terms with, if not its richest, then its most hard-working<br>
citizens, who have survived in spite of all these taxes, then it must offer<br>
small business tax conditions which are easier to meet, and more suitable,<br>
than the extortion of bandits and corrupt government officials.<br>
<p>
Will We Live to See the Audit?<br>
	The penalty for not paying any tax is, naturally, a fine of the amount<br>
hidden from the tax authorities. And for a second offense -- the fine is<br>
doubled. For small transgressions like missing the deadline, the fine is 10<br>
percent of the total calculated tax.<br>
	Possibly, these sanctions would be effective, like the fine for not<br>
presenting one's annual income declaration to the local tax authorities. But<br>
what Russian, and especially what Muscovite, does not know the saying now<br>
popular among the prosperous part of the population: "A tax audit, like a<br>
snail, is always coming, but never quite gets there..."? The point is that<br>
the government, true to its old habits, is economizing on the staff and<br>
upkeep of the Tax Service, which is like trying to economize on matches when<br>
you're in the dark. Dmitri Chernik spoke with grief about the results of<br>
such a policy: "Each tax inspector in Moscow is officially responsible for<br>
200 businesses. In fact, the number often reaches 300.<br>
	It turns out that if a tax inspector audited each of the businesses under<br>
his supervision in turn, he would get back to the first one in...30-35<br>
years. And most likely, the business would no longer be at that address by<br>
that time. And in the best case, the tax inspectorate can only check the<br>
validity of a citizen's income declaration, for example, for 1995, five<br>
years later. In short, that's closing the barn door when the horse is<br>
already gone. And that is in Moscow, where the Tax Inspectorate is the<br>
strongest. In the provinces, the wait is even longer.<br>
	I was shocked when I found out what Tax Service employees in the capital<br>
were paid. This is directly linked to the discipline in tax collecting. Last<br>
year, the average salary there was 427,000 rubles a month, plus a food<br>
allowance of another 250,000 rubles a month. This is barely over the poverty<br>
line in Moscow. Can anyone be surprised that the "tax men" take bribes for<br>
not checking a citizen's income declaration, or for closing their eyes to<br>
the fact that a business has concealed a significant part of its income?<br>
	Remember that 40 or sometimes up to 50 percent of projected tax revenues<br>
remain uncollected. Could it really be otherwise, if the tax collectors are<br>
near-destitute? And if the taxes are strangling businesses -- the main<br>
source of tax revenue?<br>
	The ones who pay taxes are those who do the work; those who are<br>
half-bankrupt pay the bribes. Wishing to collect more in taxes than<br>
businesses are able to pay, the Russian treasury has nothing to show for it<br>
but a colossal hole in the budget. Only a reasonable tax policy can<br>
liquidate it. Possibly, it will be worked out in the new tax code, most of<br>
which has already been passed by the State Duma. But an analysis of the part<br>
of this code which deals with the principles of the tax system, in the<br>
opinion of experts, shows that relief is not in the cards. But that's<br>
already another subject.<br>

SELF-PRESERVATION: THE FORCE BEHIND THE RUSSIAN POLITICAL PROCESS<br>
By Andrei Zhukov<br>
<p>
	The latest Kremlin battle is over... The outcome is clear: Anatoly Chubais<br>
has decisively defeated all of his rivals, and remains (together with the<br>
premier, who prefers not to quarrel with him) the sole master of the Russian<br>
political Olympus. The underlying economic cause of all this, it seems, is<br>
obvious. Not only the IMF, but the Moscow financial elite, and above all,<br>
its informal leaders Boris Berezovsky (the owner of the LogoVAZ concern, a<br>
co-owner of Russian Public Television, and recently, also the deputy<br>
secretary of the Security Council) and Vladimir Gusinsky (the head of the<br>
"Most" group) guided Chubais' hand. The interests of  Aleksandr Korzhakov<br>
and Aleksandr Lebed came into conflict with those of these financial groups<br>
and the whole might of the state machine came crashing down on their heads.<br>
	But this simplified scheme, based on financial considerations alone, does<br>
not explain all of the various reversals of fortune. Here, it is purely<br>
personal interests which are in the forefront, the political (and sometimes<br>
-- purely physical) survival of concrete figures. In other words,<br>
evolution's "prime mover": self-preservation.<br>
	In order to understand what really happened at the top levels of the<br>
Russian government in the last six months, one must return to the beginning<br>
of the intrigue: to the presidential campaign.<br>
<p>
Postponing the Elections: Was it a "Plot of the Force Ministers"?<br>
	Now, after some time has passed, it is quite understandable what motivated<br>
General Korzhakov when he came out with his shocking opinion that the<br>
presidential elections needed to be postponed. Being at that moment the<br>
closest person to the president, Korzhakov understood quite well that the<br>
campaign could prove fatal to the president's health. And although the wily<br>
bodyguard's true goals were far from humanitarian, the motive behind his<br>
statement really was concern for Yeltsin's health, as a guarantee of<br>
stability for himself personally, and for the team of "force ministers"<br>
which was in favor at the time.<br>
	At the same time, Chubais' team of "liberals," which was represented in<br>
Yeltsin's entourage only by First Presidential Assistant Viktor Ilyushin,<br>
thirsted to demonstrate to Yeltsin its capabilities by organizing a<br>
brilliant victory for him from an initial rating of eight percent in the<br>
polls. Their motives were also transparent: the thunderous success of the<br>
campaign would allow  them to get closer to the president, edging out the<br>
"force ministers."<br>
	The liberals, by cleverness, flattery, promises, and intrigues, succeeded<br>
in drawing the very sick, but extremely proud and ambitious leader into the<br>
exhausting race. The liquidation of Oleg Soskovets' campaign staff and its<br>
replacement with a staff consisting entirely of Chubais' and Ilyushin's<br>
people, was their first victory. Now, it is understandable why the Public<br>
Movement to Support the President [ODOP], led by Sergei Filatov, created<br>
with the same goals in mind as the Chubais-Malashenko staff, was doomed to<br>
be pushed to the side, to be immediately forgotten after the campaign. And<br>
it is just as obvious that an unenviable fate awaited the "force ministers."<br>
<p>
The Fight for Access: Two Entrances and One Exit<br>
	When the campaign began, General Korzhakov had complete control over who<br>
could see Yeltsin. To achieve their goals, Chubais' group needed to find an<br>
reliable alternative method of gaining access to the president. There was<br>
only one possibility: the only people in Yeltsin's entourage not controlled<br>
by Korzhakov were the members of his family -- his wife and daughters.<br>
	Everyone was surprised when the president, in a campaign speech, asked the<br>
people whether it was a good idea to include members of his family in the<br>
campaign. "Yes!!" the people shouted, joyfully... That was when Chubais was<br>
picked. By including the president's daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko, in the<br>
"President Hotel" campaign staff,  Chubais had already won the battle with<br>
Korzhakov. He got complete freedom to bring his thoughts and opinions to<br>
Yeltsin's attention, and to sway him in favor of certain decisions, through<br>
the person closest to Boris Nikolaevich -- his daughter Tatyana. It is clear<br>
why Chubais needed her. But why did she suddenly need to form an alliance<br>
with Chubais. This cannot be explained by just her sympathy for Anatoly<br>
Borisovich. Clearly there were other, purely personal, motives present here<br>
-- her unquenched thirst for fame, for example... Earlier, Igor Malashenko<br>
and Vladimir Kiselev offered her a job hosting a program on the then-young<br>
NTV. And she even agreed. But her all-powerful father said no.<br>
<p>
The Box Under the Xerox Machine as a Mirror of Revolution<br>
	Realizing too late that they had been defeated, the "force ministers" made<br>
one last desperate attempt to open the president's eyes to the kind of<br>
people that he had just favored with his trust. The arrest of Lisovsky and<br>
Evstafiev with a half a million dollars in cash, intended to pay for the<br>
"free" "Vote or You Lose!" concerts, should have forced the president to<br>
take a new look at his campaign staff. But it was already too late. All<br>
Chubais had to do was to ask Tatyana to tell her father that the result of<br>
the arrests would be a lack of money for the elections and their probable<br>
loss for Yeltsin's feelings to be swayed in his favor. The choice was made.<br>
Chubais stayed, and Korzhakov was forced to resign in disgrace.<br>
	Being persuaded of the effectiveness of this kind of influence on the<br>
president, Chubais continued to use it with success, consolidating his<br>
position as the "monopolist" of access to Yeltsin. It seemed that Chubais<br>
had achieved his goal: Yeltsin remained president, and Chubais' own<br>
influence (and consequently, his opportunity to work, behind Yeltsin's back,<br>
for his own purposes), thanks to his friendship with Tatyana Borisovna, got<br>
stronger and stronger. But a serious additional factor interfered in the<br>
plans of the new chief of presidential administration: the sharp decline in<br>
Boris Nikolaevich's health, which occurred between the two rounds of the<br>
election. Chubais suddenly clearly realized that if Yeltsin's health did not<br>
permit him to exercise his powers, a new president would knock him, Chubais,<br>
off of Russia's political Olympus.<br>
<p>
"Lebed is Yeltsin Today"*<br>
	So once again, Anatoly Borisovich had to look for a way to remain in place<br>
if Yeltsin left office. The first alternative examined by Chubais while the<br>
campaign was still in full swing was to "replace" the sick Yeltsin with the<br>
healthy Lebed as a manageable, controllable figure in the nation's highest<br>
political post. It was this which explained the financial and organizational<br>
support which Chubais offered Lebed in the June elections. Chubais' goal was<br>
to tie the charismatic general to him as tightly as possible, to put Lebed<br>
in his debt, and thereby guarantee himself a safe spot in the Kremlin, no<br>
matter how Yeltsin's illness turned out.<br>
	All the indications suggested that this plan would succeed: Lebed publicly<br>
supported the course of reforms, the policy pursued by Chernomyrdin and<br>
Chubais, expressed his willingness to work within the existing apparatus,<br>
and finally, received from the president a position as his assistant.<br>
Yeltsin, in turn, almost officially proclaimed Lebed as his successor and<br>
the "continuer" of his course in the 2000 elections.<br>
	But Chubais' plans to make a "new Yeltsin" out of Lebed were fated not to<br>
be realized. In "covering for" the presidential chief of administration's<br>
personnel purges (kicking out the "force ministers," disbanding the<br>
president's analytical office, replacing the last members of the<br>
"Ekaterinburg team" in the Kremlin and Staraya Ploshchad with his own<br>
people), and signing the Khasavyurt accords, so unfavorable to Russia<br>
(which, by the way, suited the general's own plans to increase his own<br>
popularity), under the conditions dictated to him by Chubais, Lebed<br>
considered all his debts to Chubais to be paid, and behaved in a completely<br>
unexpected way. He forged an alliance with Korzhakov.<br>
<p>
The Tandem of Generals<br>
	Gen. Korzhakov, removed from his posts as chief of the presidential<br>
bodyguard, was working feverishly on his own campaign for the seat in the<br>
State Duma from Tula vacated by Lebed, and was speaking out in the media,<br>
threatening to expose the corruption of top officials. For Korzhakov to win<br>
the immunity from prosecution that comes with being a deputy, he needed a<br>
popular leader to "bless" his candidacy. Gen. Lebed was the ideal man for that.<br>
	At the same time, Korzhakov, who had lost his influence in the Kremlin,<br>
nevertheless held on to his sources of money in the National Sports Fund,<br>
making him an ideal  source of alternative funding.<br>
	For Chubais, the alliance was a mortal threat, particularly if Yeltsin had<br>
to resign for health reasons. And the presidential chief of administration's<br>
retaliatory blows were not long in coming. The NTV and ORT television<br>
channels, under Chubais' control, sharply changed the tone of their coverage<br>
of Aleksandr Lebed's activities, from exultation to deep alarm, and then<br>
launched into a "feeding frenzy."<br>
<p>
"Friendly Fire"<br>
	The situation around Lebed began to heat up and the scandal broke at<br>
Minister of Internal Affairs Anatoly Kulikov's press conference on October<br>
16. From all indications, it was on this day that Anatoly Chubais, who had<br>
hoped until the last moment that he would succeed in keeping Lebed in a more<br>
or less manageable condition, finally parted with his hopes of working with<br>
him in the upcoming presidential campaign, and declared war on him. It is<br>
well known that two weeks before these stormy events, a decree removing<br>
Lebed had been prepared, and that Chubais tabled it. Now, the decree was<br>
given the green light.<br>
	Chubais' goal obviously was to "knock the generals' heads together,"<br>
tarring them both with the same brush. This is one of his favorite tactics.<br>
One may recall, for example, the situation with the box underneath the Xerox<br>
machine, described above, in which half a million dollars was carried out of<br>
the White House. The removal of Korzhakov &amp; Co. was successfully<br>
"transferred" by Chubais onto Lebed's shoulders. Now history was repeating<br>
itself -- Chubais used Kulikov to remove Lebed.<br>
	The goal of "setting Kulikov up" in this way was to discredit the minister,<br>
who had hinted more than once that if there were early presidential<br>
elections, his sympathies would be on the side of the most genuine and<br>
popular leader at this time: Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov. The simple-minded<br>
Kulikov took the bait which the wily Chubais threw him, and his speech was a<br>
strange mix of real information and clearly false allegations (like the<br>
story about the "1500 Chechen fighters" which Maskhadov had supposedly<br>
promised Lebed).<br>
	Thus, Kulikov, on one hand, disclosed certain activities and statements of<br>
the ambitious Gen. Lebed, which served as the formal justification for the<br>
latter's banishment, and on the other--provided a basis for accusations of<br>
slander to be made against him.<br>
<p>
Chubais and Chernomyrdin: Together or Apart?<br>
	After monopolizing both the official (through the decree regularizing the<br>
flow of documents to be signed by the president) and unofficial (through the<br>
president's daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko) means of contact with Boris<br>
Yeltsin, and getting the opportunity to give any piece of information<br>
reaching the president the interpretation most favorable to himself, Anatoly<br>
Borisovich has become virtually the only person in the country who has the<br>
right to make final decisions.<br>
	But there is still Chernomyrdin, who has been entrusted, both by the<br>
constitution and by Yeltsin's special decree, with the power to be "acting<br>
president," if anything happens. Chubais, on the one hand, prefers not to<br>
quarrel with him, and on the other, if the rumors can be believed, is<br>
quietly preparing his removal. The first step in this direction was the<br>
creation of the much-publicized Temporary Extraordinary Commission [VChK] on<br>
Taxes. It is said that if tax revenues do not go up significantly, that it<br>
will be seen as a failure "on Chernomyrdin's watch." According to some<br>
information, if that happens, it would be Chubais who would be made<br>
temporary leader of the government.<br>
	Besides the aforementioned VChK, whose failure can easily be blamed on the<br>
prime minister, Chubais has another move in reserve, which would undermine<br>
the economic base for Chernomyrdin's existence as an independent political<br>
figure. Its essence is the  possible claim that the all-powerful Gazprom is<br>
a monopolist on the Russian market. Existing anti-monopoly legislation gives<br>
at least formal justification for the forced dismemberment of the empire of<br>
Chernomyrdin and Rem Vyakhirev into several gas companies, which would make<br>
it far easier to fight with them.<br>
	Another alternative which is being openly prepared by Chubais is to make an<br>
example of Gazprom, and the companies which make it up, for their enormous<br>
tax debt (of 15 trillion rubles). The wily "chief administrator," of course,<br>
will see to it that the main initiator of the punishment of Gazprom is...<br>
[Chernomyrdin's] government, in that way, causing a rift between the premier<br>
and his main business partner and companion, Rem Vyakhirev. Such blows could<br>
seriously diminish Chernomyrdin's chances of becoming an independent<br>
candidate for the presidential post, and force him to come to terms with<br>
Chubais. Or to fight him.<br>
<p>
People Who Will Stop at Nothing?<br>
	All of the chain of events described above, from the moment of the<br>
president's entry into the campaign to the most recent sensational<br>
resignations in the Kremlin, produce, at first glance, the impression of<br>
being extraordinarily complicated, the cleverly-constructed intrigues on the<br>
part of one group of people to seize power in the country. But only at first<br>
glance. What if there were no "clever intrigues," but, at each concrete<br>
moment, all of the personalities described above were guided by simple<br>
self-preservation? Out of the instinct for self-preservation, the<br>
president's entourage talked an elderly, sick president into running again.<br>
Out of the instinct for self-preservation, Viktor Chernomyrdin decided not<br>
to run for president. Out of the instinct for self-preservation, Anatoly<br>
Chubais and others with him began to "groom" Lebed, trying to make a<br>
charismatic, popular, and manageable leader out of him, ready to replace<br>
Yeltsin in 2000.<br>
	The instinct of self-preservation (already, true, in relation to the<br>
members of his own family) forced Yeltsin to fire Korzhakov and his team,<br>
and forced the latter, in turn, to remain silent for a long time, and "keep<br>
his nose out of what wasn't his business." It was this all-powerful instinct<br>
which now forces him to fight for a seat as deputy, and to come forward with<br>
sensational revelations now that all of his channels of direct communication<br>
with the president have been cut off forever.<br>
	It is the same instinct for self-preservation which then pushed Lebed into<br>
supporting Korzhakov, and Chernomyrdin, into supporting Chubais. What next?<br>
This same instinct could inevitably lead to a battle between the two actors<br>
left on the stage. And God grant that this battle not lead to fighting on<br>
the streets as it did  that terrifying October of 1993. Because when people,<br>
who have power in all its plenitude at their disposal, are guided<br>
exclusively by the instinct for self-preservation, they are ready to stop at<br>
nothing...<br>

THE ALMOST UNKNOWN GRU<br>
by Stanislav Lunev<br>
<p>
	In October, 1995, a Russian government delegation, headed by First Deputy<br>
Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, signed a number of documents on developing<br>
Russo-Cuban cooperation. There would be no reason to call this fact<br>
noteworthy, if it were not for one small detail. All these documents -- on<br>
credits to continue construction on the Juragua atomic power station, on<br>
resuming arms supplies to the Cuban army, on supplying Cuba with oil and, on<br>
creating Russo-Cuban joint ventures in oil refining -- had one thing in common.<br>
	Virtually all the credits offered by the Russian government to Cuba were<br>
intended to compensate Cuba for Russian intelligence's continued use of the<br>
Lourdes radio-technical intelligence station, which one of the members of<br>
the Russian government delegation called "a unique facility of Russia's<br>
national security system." And it is difficult to disagree with such a<br>
definition, since this station, located close to U.S. territory, is able to<br>
register, take bearings on, and determine the sources of the<br>
radio-electronic signals of the guidance systems of American strategic<br>
weapons systems, determine the patrolling patterns of atomic missile<br>
submarines, and intercept radio and radio-technical (including commercial)<br>
communications on American territory, in addition to many other functions.<br>
	The characteristics of this station and the threat it poses to US national<br>
security are well-known to specialists, but only a rather small number of<br>
people know who the people stationed at Lourdes work for and who is given<br>
this top-secret American information. Because, contrary to the widely-held<br>
opinion that this station is run by the successors of the former KGB, in<br>
real life, it falls under the jurisdiction of the most secret element of the<br>
Russian national security system -- the Main Intelligence Directorate [GRU]<br>
of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, about whose activities,<br>
little-known to outsiders, legends circulate among professionals.<br>
	Thus, it is a rather well-known fact that the turning point in the Second<br>
World War and the victory of Soviet troops at Stalingrad were the direct<br>
result of the activity of GRU intelligence officers, who were able to learn<br>
that Japan had no intention of attacking the USSR. This made it possible for<br>
the Soviet Union to shift fresh Siberian divisions to the Volga, which<br>
routed Paulus' army. But few know that it was thanks to professional<br>
intelligence officers of the GRU that the "network" of so-called "atom<br>
spies" was created that gave Moscow the secrets of the Manhattan Project.<br>
The "Cambridge Spy Ring," one of whose main activists, George Blake, was<br>
under the direct control of GRU intelligence officers, also obtained<br>
materials of extraordinary importance.<br>
	Also almost unknown to outsiders are such events as the GRU's direct<br>
participation in securing the deployment of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba<br>
in 1961, the activity of GRU special operations forces [spetsnaz] in<br>
Afghanistan in removing [assassinating] that country's president on the eve<br>
of the invasion of Soviet troops, when the former KGB's special operations<br>
forces, dressed in Soviet and Afghan uniforms, almost bungled the operation<br>
by shooting at each other. According to one recent joke, if Aldrich Ames,<br>
"the last spy of the Cold War," had been run by the GRU, and not by the<br>
successors of the former KGB, he would have continued to harm US national<br>
security for many years, and would have finished his career, not in a<br>
Pennsylvania maximum-security prison, but in a dacha somewhere near Moscow.<br>
	It is characteristic that Soviet military strategic intelligence, created<br>
in the 1920s as the GRU of the General Staff of the Workers' and Peasants'<br>
Red Army, has not changed its name even once, in sharp distinction to its<br>
long-time competitor, political intelligence, which changed its name from<br>
VChK, to NKVD, to MGB, to KGB, and finally, to SVR. The name was kept the<br>
same so that the hundreds and thousands of citizens of countries on the<br>
American, Eurasian, African, and Australian continents who had offered their<br>
services to the GRU could be confident that they were dealing with a<br>
powerful agency that would continue its work under any circumstances, in<br>
spite of any changes in the Soviet Union's political leadership and, indeed,<br>
in spite of the disappearance of the Soviet Union itself.<br>
	After the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the short [1991-1992]<br>
period of subordination to the already-mythical CIS Unified Military<br>
Command, the former Soviet military intelligence was included in the<br>
military-political system of the new "democratic" Russian Federation, and<br>
became known officially as the GRU of the General Staff of the Russian Armed<br>
Forces. To understand how this agency, one of the most powerful intelligence<br>
agencies in the world, worked and still works, all one has to do is turn to<br>
a world map, where it is not difficult to find the little star marked<br>
"Moscow" -- the capital of the Russian Federation.<br>
	It is here, on the edge of the Central Airport, that the headquarters of<br>
the GRU, with its central apparatus and its support staff, are located,<br>
guarded more tightly than the lives of the country's highest military and<br>
political leaders. The GRU's structure is simple and effective, rather<br>
flexible, and quickly adaptable to the country's current military needs. In<br>
addition to the staff of the head of the GRU, the main<br>
intelligence-gathering units, the so-called Operational Directorates<br>
[operativnye upravleniia], are here.<br>
	The First Operational Directorate of the GRU, traditionally, ever since the<br>
Second World War, called the "European" directorate, is responsible for<br>
conducting intelligence operations against the countries of Western and<br>
(since the beginning of the 1990s) Eastern Europe. The Second Operational<br>
Directorate, for just as long, has been called the "Asiatic" directorate,<br>
and is responsible for conducting intelligence operations against Central,<br>
South and East Asian countries, as well as the countries of the Far East,<br>
Australia, and New Zealand. The Third Operational Directorate is responsible<br>
for conducting intelligence operations against countries on the American<br>
continent and Great Britain, and the Fourth Operational Directorate<br>
organizes military intelligence activity against countries in the Middle<br>
East and Africa.<br>
	These directorates employ a small staff of first-class professional<br>
intelligence officers with substantial experience working against the<br>
countries in their operational area. Thanks to their efforts, the GRU's<br>
intelligence activity against various countries is organized, then carried<br>
out by the GRU's field office [rezidentura] or offices as, for example, in<br>
the United States, where there are GRU field offices operating in Washington<br>
and New York, with more being set up in San Francisco and Seattle.<br>
	Operations officers in these GRU field offices carefully research the<br>
country against which they work, and seek to learn its most important<br>
secrets by recruiting persons who have access to information of interest to<br>
the GRU and are ready to sell it. Such work frequently ends successfully for<br>
the intelligence officers, who are thus able to penetrate into the "holy of<br>
holies" of the countries against which they are working.<br>
	The information received from the field offices is divided up among the<br>
GRU's Operations Directorates by territory, and is processed by the<br>
so-called Operational Branches [napravleniia], which are territorially<br>
narrower in scope. For example, in the structure of the Third (American)<br>
Operational Directorate, responsibility is divided among branches which<br>
conduct intelligence operations against the United States, Latin America,<br>
Great Britain, and Canada.<br>
	Before the disintegration of the Soviet Union, another Operational<br>
Directorate -- the Fifth Operational Directorate -- ran and coordinated the<br>
activity of the Intelligence Directorates of all the military districts,<br>
army groups and fleets, but in recent years, it has become the main organ<br>
conducting intelligence against the former union republics, which are now<br>
called the Newly Independent States. There are other GRU intelligence organs<br>
which work in close coordination with the units named above, including the<br>
First Branch [napravlenie], which is responsible for working against<br>
foreigners who visit or live on Russian territory, the Special Branch<br>
[napravlenie], which supervises the activity of military "illegals," the<br>
Special Center, which organizes special training of terrorist groups and the<br>
organs in charge of other forms of intelligence and reconnaissance, first of<br>
all, space reconnaissance, radio and radio-technical intelligence,<br>
communications, cryptography, and others. <br>
	Each GRU Operations Directorate is supported by its own information<br>
directorate, where area specialists on America, Europe, Asia and Africa, and<br>
other regions work together with specialists on science and technology,<br>
strategic analysis, arms control, and much more. And the collation,<br>
analysis, and processing of the operational information brought in goes on<br>
twenty-four hours a day in the GRU Command Post.<br>
	If one takes into account that GRU Headquarters also has a Personnel<br>
Directorate and a Directorate of Material and Technical Supply, and also a<br>
few small scientific and technical branches, the total number of people<br>
working at Russia's military intelligence center comes to a little over<br>
2,500 people, or approximately the same number of people working at the<br>
headquarters of Russian political intelligence [the SVR] in Yasenevo. But to<br>
flesh out the picture, one needs to take another look at the map, on which<br>
Moscow is linked by the direct lines of communication of the Operations<br>
Directorates to the GRU's field offices abroad, located in their zones of<br>
operational responsibility.<br>
	And if you draw a circle with a radius of several hundred miles, within<br>
that circle, you will see that the GRU also has at its disposal, both inside<br>
the Russian capital and a short distance outside it, scientific research<br>
centers, institutes, and laboratories, special training centers and camps,<br>
testing grounds, and even factories where special spying equipment is<br>
produced, all meticulously stamped "made in" the USA, Japan, Germany, and<br>
other countries.<br>
	The military strategic special operations brigades, known to almost no one,<br>
which are trained to eliminate, in a matter of minutes, the military and<br>
political leaders of other countries, no matter how closely they are<br>
guarded, to knock out the enemy's main, auxiliary, and reserve command<br>
points, to destroy the control centers and launchers of the enemy's<br>
strategic missile forces, the bombers which can deliver strategic and<br>
operational-tactical nuclear weapons, and to fulfill other more or less<br>
important tasks, are also stationed near Moscow. GRU specialists directly<br>
train and care for these brigades, which are always on the alert, ready for<br>
action as soon as they receive the command.<br>
	But to take a broader look at the GRU, you have to turn to the map once<br>
again, where the Russian military districts and fleets are now depicted,<br>
each of them having their own Intelligence Directorate [upravlenie], which<br>
has several Intelligence Points, each of which has up to twenty professional<br>
intelligence officers, subordinate to it. These points conduct recruitment<br>
work among foreigners and Russian citizens, which could be used both in<br>
peacetime and in wartime in the intelligence interests of the front. The<br>
companies, battalions, and brigades of army, military-district, and naval<br>
special operations forces, which are officially subordinate to the<br>
Intelligence directorates of the military districts and fleets, in fact, get<br>
all their training, and material and technical supply from the GRU, which is<br>
the true boss of the special operations forces.<br>
	Neither the SVR nor any of the other Russian intelligence services have<br>
such might at their disposal. And moreover, neither the SVR nor any other<br>
intelligence service has space reconnaissance, which is under the GRU's<br>
exclusive jurisdiction, nor air reconnaissance, nor radio and<br>
radio-technical intelligence, whose stations and posts, both on the<br>
territory of the former USSR and in other countries, leave no foreign<br>
military signals unnoticed, and can crack the intricate codes used by<br>
foreign governments to conceal their most sensitive national security<br>
information easily.<br>
	Everything mentioned above is part of a single and strictly-centralized<br>
intelligence system, which is able to deliver intelligence information of a<br>
strategic character to the country's highest military and political<br>
leadership upon demand. To think that the GRU works for itself alone would<br>
be simply naive, for questions of where military intelligence activity is to<br>
be directed are decided by the political leadership, not by the General<br>
Staff or the minister of defense. Having before it the tasks posed by the<br>
political leadership, the GRU collects, processes, analyzes and collates<br>
information on the country's most likely adversaries, their military and<br>
political plans and intentions, the condition of their armed forces,<br>
military-industrial complex, scientific-research work in the military field,<br>
and, in general, on everything which could be used to achieve military<br>
victory in the case of a possible or probable armed conflict in the future.<br>
	Therefore, it is not by chance that when the highest Russian leaders speak<br>
about intelligence matters, they, as a rule, touch on the activity of the<br>
well-known successor to the KGB's First Main Directorate -- the present SVR,<br>
but almost never mention the subject of military strategic intelligence.<br>
Because it would be rather difficult for the same Russian government which<br>
tells the USSR's former political and military adversaries of its desire for<br>
peace, cooperation, and strategic partnership, and even a future alliance,<br>
to explain its support for the activities of the GRU, which, as always, is<br>
working with its eye towards a future war against those countries which<br>
Moscow today officially declares to be its partners and friends.<br>
	The organization of this work, intended to help Russia in a future war, is,<br>
naturally, a rather complicated process, but it can be explained with<br>
concrete examples. Suppose, for example, that the radio-technical<br>
intelligence station in Lourdes, Cuba mentioned above takes bearings on<br>
"unidentified" electronic signals coming from the USA's East Coast. On the<br>
leadership's command, the GRU's system is immediately set into motion, and<br>
intelligence satellites are used to help define the source of the signal.<br>
Air and naval reconnaissance, whose ships and planes, disguised as<br>
commercial and research vessels, are specially equipped for this purpose,<br>
and are on constant patrol, are called in for assistance.<br>
	As far as is possible, the GRU's agents, who can penetrate where radio,<br>
radio-technical, optic, laser, and other forms of radiation cannot, are also<br>
called in. All of this information is then used to form an idea of what the<br>
"unknown installation's" purpose and capabilities are, which can later be<br>
sharpened, broadened, supplemented, etc., and reported to the country's<br>
highest leadership and used in the General Staff's plans for the possible<br>
destruction of this installation at the beginning of a new war.<br>
	All in all, the GRU is a carefully-calibrated intelligence mechanism, able<br>
to carry out virtually any task the country's military and political<br>
leadership sets before it at any time. And today, the question of the<br>
practical use of this mechanism is not how it works in everyday practice,<br>
but to what end it can be used most effectively at the present time. For<br>
example, today, the GRU could devote its attention to local and regional<br>
conflicts to ward off future conflicts and localize existing ones or take<br>
part in the world community's efforts to fight international terrorism and<br>
organized crime.<br>
	But to this day, there are no encouraging reports to this effect in the<br>
press, and, on  orders of Russia's highest military and political<br>
leadership, the country's strategic military intelligence continues to work<br>
towards the same goal it had in the past -- to prepare Russia and its armed<br>
forces for a new war, although possibly in the remote future. Against<br>
whom--it is hard to say, but the target could be any one of the countries<br>
where its forward elements or field offices are stationed. And here, it<br>
doesn't matter whether the prospective target is, in the "near" or the "far"<br>
abroad.<br>

NEWS:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT DELIGHTED WITH PROGRESS OF DEBUT EUROBOND ISSUE. Russia<br>
has announced further details of its forthcoming eurobond issue, promising a<br>
yield of approximately 9.5 percent. The Russian government is understood to<br>
have been anxious to keep interest below 10 percent, so this is being seen<br>
in western financial circles as a significant achievement that will give<br>
Russia a psychological boost and improve its chances of raising further sums<br>
on international markets. (BBC World Service, November 21)<br>
<p>
RUSSIA MAY JOIN WTO IN 1997. Russia hopes to join the World Trade<br>
Organization (WTO) in 1997, Minister for Foreign Economic Relations Oleg<br>
Davydov said following an informal meeting with WTO officials in Geneva<br>
yesterday. He said the WTO has agreed to accelerate Russia's application,<br>
first made two years ago. The slow progress of Moscow's application to date<br>
reflects Russia's failure to convince the WTO that it has brought all its<br>
trading practices into line with world standards. Davydov said Russia will<br>
submit proposals on tariff reform in January and the next official meeting<br>
will be held in April. He said he thought one more meeting would be needed<br>
after that to agree on a protocol for admission. (Itar-Tass, November 20)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN DUMA RECOMMENDS MORATORIUM ON DEATH PENALTY. The lower house of the<br>
Russian parliament has called on the upper house to introduce a moratorium<br>
on capital punishment and to suspend executions until the issue is resolved<br>
legally (the death penalty is specifically sanctioned by the Russian<br>
Constitution). Russia stated its intention of imposing such a moratorium<br>
when it joined the Council of Europe last February, but many deputies oppose<br>
the move. A total of 238 people were sentenced to death in Russia last year.<br>
Of those, 40 have been executed. (Itar-Tass, November 19)<br>
<p>
BEREZOVSKY DOES NOT HAVE ISRAELI CITIZENSHIP. Israel's ambassador to Russia<br>
announced yesterday that Boris Berezovsky, deputy secretary of Russia's<br>
Security Council, does not have Israeli citizenship. The ambassador said a<br>
statement by the Israeli Foreign Ministry to that effect was forwarded to<br>
the Russian Foreign Ministry a week ago. She did not say whether Berezovsky<br>
had been deprived of citizenship at his own request or whether he had never<br>
had it in the first place. (Itar-Tass, November 20)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN BUDGET DEBATE IS POSTPONED. Discussion of the draft budget in the<br>
Russian Duma will not start until December 4. Seven tax laws have to be<br>
examined before consideration of the budget can begin. Approval of the<br>
budget by both chambers of the Russian parliament seems unlikely before the<br>
end of the year. (Interfax, November 20)<br>
<p>
REGIONAL LEADER URGES RETURN OF KURIL ISLANDS TO JAPAN. Nikolai Fedorov, the<br>
President of Chuvashiya, told visiting Japanese parliamentarians in Moscow<br>
yesterday that Russia should return the four disputed Kuril Islands to<br>
Japan. Fedorov, who is also deputy chairman of the Federation Council's<br>
International Affairs Committee, attributed Moscow's intransigence to<br>
misguided patriotism and Russia's low level of legal culture. A Foreign<br>
Ministry spokesman rushed to clarify that Fedorov's opinions did not reflect<br>
the views of the Russian government. (Interfax, November 20)<br>
<p>
MIG-29'S ARRIVE IN PERU. The unpublicized delivery to Peru of 12 MiG-29's<br>
from Belarus has reportedly raised fears of a regional arms race and is<br>
expected to intensify calls from U.S. arms manufacturers for the lifting of<br>
a U.S. ban on sales of high-tech weaponry to Latin America. Observers<br>
believe that the delivery could also undermine sensitive peace talks between<br>
Peru and Ecuador. The sophisticated aircraft were detected recently by U.S.<br>
intelligence sources. (The Washington Post, November 20)<br>
<p>
RUSSIA-BELARUS CUSTOMS UNION CRITICIZED. Russia intends shortly to request<br>
that Belarus harmonize its tax legislation with Russia's in order to avoid<br>
distortions in trade, a representative of the Russian State Customs<br>
Committee said yesterday. Russia has introduced some changes in its taxes<br>
that have been not followed by Belarus, and customs tariffs in the two<br>
countries still differ on 200 groups of products. Because of the differences<br>
Belarus has been used as a gateway to channel imports to Russia. (Interfax,<br>
November 20)<br>

<p>
CHECHEN FIGHTERS TAKE RUSSIAN HOSTAGES. Unknown gunmen attacked a Russian<br>
military post near the Khankala airport on the outskirts of Grozny November<br>
20. Three servicemen were killed and two others were wounded. (ORT, November<br>
20) The same day, two Russian servicemen were taken hostage. The Chechen<br>
field commander in charge of this operation has demanded the release of<br>
three of his unit's fighters, arrested over a month ago at a Russian<br>
checkpoint. (NTV, November 20)<br>
<p>
It may be no coincidence that these events occurred on the eve of Russian<br>
premier Viktor Chernomyrdin's proposed visit to Chechnya to meet with<br>
Chechen premier Aslan Maskhadov. During the visit, the status of the 101st<br>
brigade of Russia's Interior Ministry troops and the 205th brigade of<br>
Defense Ministry troops will be discussed. (ORT, November 20) Moscow<br>
continues to insist that these units must remain in Chechnya permanently.<br>
(RTR, November 16) The Chechens, however, continue to demand the complete<br>
withdrawal of all Russian military units, and have stressed that the success<br>
of the negotiations between the two prime ministers will depend on Russian<br>
compliance. It seems possible, therefore, that in attacking these Russian<br>
posts Chechen resistance fighters are trying to pressure Moscow to agree to<br>
a complete withdrawal. This does not necessarily mean the acts were<br>
committed on the order of the resistance leaders -- they may have come at<br>
the initiative of rogue field commanders.<br>
<p>
YELTSIN SHOWN ON RUSSIAN TV. President Boris Yeltsin made his first<br>
television appearance yesterday following his heart surgery two weeks ago.<br>
Looking thin and moving stiffly but speaking clearly and confidently,<br>
Yeltsin was seen walking on the hospital grounds with his wife Naina,<br>
younger daughter Tatyana Dyachenko, and granddaughter Masha. Yeltsin said<br>
his heart no longer hurts the way it did prior to his operation. His doctors<br>
say that the Russian president should be able to leave the hospital at the<br>
end of this week and transfer to a sanitarium close to Moscow. Yeltsin said<br>
he was "ready for action" and eager to return to work, and that he would ask<br>
all top official to "account for their actions" during his absence from the<br>
Kremlin. (Reuter, UPI, BBC World Service, November 20)=20<br>
<p>
In an interview published yesterday in Izvestiya, Yeltsin's wife<br>
acknowledged that Tatyana Dyachenko's role on the presidential team is<br>
controversial. But she denied allegations that her daughter had made<br>
personnel appointments or played a role in issuing presidential decrees. "As<br>
long as Boris Nikolaevich works," Yeltsin's wife said, "I'd like Tanya to<br>
help him. She'll never deceive him. And she'll tell him what others won't."<br>
(Reuters, November 20)<br>
<p>
KADANNIKOV RETURNS TO VAZ. Vladimir Kadannikov, who in January of this year<br>
replaced Anatoly Chubais as first deputy prime minister in charge of<br>
Russia's economy, has returned to work at the Volga Auto Factory (VAZ).<br>
Until he joined the government, Kadannikov was director general of VAZ,<br>
Russia's biggest car maker and the producer of Ladas and Zhigulis.<br>
Kadannikov's subsequent departure from the government, in July, provoked a<br>
potentially divisive battle for control of the factory, which, for all its<br>
problems, remains a major Russian export earner and a vital contributor to<br>
the economy of the Volga region. Moscow financial circles wanted Kadannikov<br>
reinstated in his old job since Moscow had received a steady flow of funds<br>
from VAZ under Kadannikov's management that ceased under his successor,<br>
Aleksei Nikolaev. But VAZ's 110,000-strong workforce preferred Nikolaev's<br>
management. When Kadannikov left for Moscow in January, VAZ workers had not<br>
been paid for three months. Nikolaev won their support by paying their wages<br>
on time. Moreover, the opinion of workers at VAZ counts because, under the<br>
terms by which the plant was privatized, the workforce owns 49 percent of<br>
the company's equity. (Samarskoe obozrenie, November 4)<br>
<p>
A compromise was reached last week during a meeting of VAZ shareholders at<br>
which Kadannikov was appointed chairman of the board of directors.<br>
(Itar-Tass, November 18) This is largely a figurehead post, lacking real<br>
power. Nikolaev remains in control in the twin posts of general director<br>
(that is, chief executive) and president of VAZ. The workers are pleased,<br>
and Kadannikov saves face. He may even be able to use his Moscow influence<br>
to help VAZ solve its huge debt problems (the plant owes the equivalent of<br>
hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid taxes).<br>
<p>
DID MOSCOW HELP UNCOVER ACCUSED CIA SPY? According to an affidavit filed by<br>
the FBI, Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) may have inadvertently<br>
provided one of the clues that helped U.S. counterintelligence agents track<br>
down accused CIA spy Harold Nicholson. Ironically, the relevant exchange<br>
between the two intelligence services could not have happened prior to the<br>
end of the Cold War and the beginning of U.S.-Russian cooperation efforts.<br>
The tip-off apparently started in mid-March of this year, when the SVR<br>
officially contacted the FBI for information on Chechen terrorism. Despite<br>
having no need for such information in his own work, Nicholson asked CIA<br>
headquarters for background on Chechnya at the end of April, and then in<br>
July began using his computer to search CIA databases for information keyed<br>
to the words "Chechnya" and "Russia." Those activities reportedly brought<br>
Nicholson to the attention of CIA security officers. When FBI agents<br>
searched Nicholson's computer in August, they found a copy of a secret CIA<br>
report on Chechnya. The FBI apparently believes that different departments<br>
of the SVR may have failed to coordinate their activities, and that<br>
Nicholson might been tasked with procuring the information on Chechnya<br>
despite the parallel request for information on Chechen terrorism from the<br>
FBI. (AP, November 20)<br>
<p>
FEEDING THE ARMED FORCES. Government and military officials met in Moscow on<br>
November 19 at a conference on ensuring food supplies for the armed forces.<br>
As with most problems in Russia today, funding shortfalls were identified as<br>
the biggest hurdle. Deputy Economics Minister Ivan Starikov told the<br>
conference that the military had been granted 6.2 trillion rubles in the<br>
1996 budget for feeding the troops, although it had requested 8 trillion.<br>
Thus far this year  the armed forces have received less than half the<br>
allocated amount. As a result, the military had by November 1 gone into debt<br>
to its food suppliers by 2.3 trillion rubles. Starikov noted that the<br>
Defense Ministry had asked for 10 trillion rubles for food in the 1997<br>
budget--an amount it is unlikely to receive. (Nezavisimaya gazeta, November<br>
20, Itar-Tass, November 19)<br>
<p>
The government hopes that centralizing all food procurement in one agency<br>
will be more economical, and has made the Agricultural Ministry's Federal<br>
Food Corporation "fully responsible for providing food supplies" to the<br>
armed forces. It is to use only domestic sources for its purchases.<br>
(Itar-Tass, November 19) The Federal Food Corporation, however, has itself<br>
been hamstrung by underfunding since its creation two years ago. It also<br>
lacks storage facilities of its own and has been criticized for improperly<br>
managing the money it has received. (Interfax, October 31, Russia TV,<br>
October 20) As in the Soviet days, the military devotes a considerable<br>
effort to feeding itself -- often at the expense of military training. The<br>
Defense Ministry manages a number of large farms, and nearly every unit<br>
engages in agricultural activities on a smaller scale. (Interfax, October<br>
31; Russia TV, October 20)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
RUSSIA TURNING UP PRESSURE ON SEVASTOPOL. Russian president Boris Yeltsin's<br>
foreign policy aide, Dmitry Ryurikov, stated at a Moscow briefing yesterday<br>
that "the Russian fleet alone must be based in Sevastopol. We are working on<br>
that." Ryurikov added that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's planned<br>
visit to Ukraine has been postponed indefinitely pending resolution of the<br>
fleet dispute. (Interfax, November 20). Ryurikov's statement is consistent<br>
with Yeltsin's directive "not to surrender anything in Sevastopol" in the<br>
negotiations with Ukraine over the fleet. That instruction was cited by the<br>
Black Sea Fleet commander, Adm. Viktor Kravchenko, in a letter to Ryurikov<br>
reproduced by the Russian press last week. "B. N. Yeltsin's directive has<br>
been followed undeviatingly," the Admiral wrote, adding that division of<br>
naval bases in Sevastopol would lead to the loss of the city by Russia.<br>
(Nezavisimaya gazeta, November 14)<br>
<p>
Russian Public Television (ORT), meanwhile, has included the Sevastopol area<br>
in the nightly weather forecasts for regions of the Russian Federation. The<br>
Ukrainian Foreign Ministry announced yesterday that it has twice protested<br>
the move as "inadmissible" in notes to the Russian Foreign Ministry and to<br>
ORT management, but the protests are being ignored. Kiev is now weighing<br>
follow-up steps, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Yury Serhyev said.<br>
(Interfax-Ukraine, November 19 and 20)<br>
<p>
Moscow's insistence on exclusive basing rights in Sevastopol has recently<br>
set back the Black Sea Fleet talks, despite Kiev's offers of concessions on<br>
other fleet-related issues. Moscow and Kiev both realize that exclusive<br>
basing of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol would compromise Ukrainian<br>
sovereignty in the city and in the Crimea as a whole. Unlike the Duma's<br>
majority and certain Russian presidential hopefuls who have made territorial<br>
claims, the Russian government apparently seeks to consolidate Moscow's<br>
presence in Sevastopol through nonspectacular, practical steps.<br>
<p>
RYURIKOV DEEMS UKRAINIAN INDEPENDENCE TEMPORARY. At his briefing yesterday,<br>
Ryurikov asserted that "a closer Russian-Ukrainian economic, political, and<br>
military union is not in sight for the time being, in the short term."<br>
Ryurikov argued that Ukrainian history includes phases of "assertion of<br>
Ukrainian statehood to the detriment of close relations with Russia. This is<br>
apparently occurring now, it is a temporary phenomenon." (Interfax, November<br>
20) This unusually open official assertion reflects an oft-stated view among<br>
Russian political and cultural elites that Ukrainian independence is<br>
unnatural, contrary to Kiev's own interests, and transitory.<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
GEORGIA SEEKS TO CONTROL NATIONAL BORDERS. The commander of Georgia's border<br>
troops, Maj. Gen. Valery Chkheidze, yesterday announced that the country's<br>
fledgling navy -- comprised of eight cutters -- began on November 19 to<br>
patrol Georgian coastal waters. The move signifies "a further step toward<br>
asserting the country's independence," Chkheidze stated. He added, however,<br>
that Georgia is not yet capable of fully controlling its territorial waters.<br>
In response, the command of the Russian border forces' stated that its<br>
warships will continue patrolling Georgian waters as heretofore.<br>
<p>
Earlier this month, Tbilisi announced that it had introduced a new air<br>
communication code designed to control Russian military flights at Vaziani<br>
and Alekseyevka, the main Russian airfields in the Tbilisi area. Russian<br>
military aircraft use those airfields for unauthorized flights, including<br>
commercial ones, that circumvent Georgian border and customs controls. The<br>
Georgian government now seeks to introduce checkpoints there.<br>
<p>
The Georgian military command and President Eduard Shevardnadze have also<br>
asked to take over at least in part from Russian forces the control of<br>
Georgia's border with Turkey. Russian border troops have been stationed<br>
there since 1994. A further sore point is the Russian border troops' control<br>
of the Abkhaz sector of Georgia's border with Russia. In apparent<br>
retaliation, the Russian side has threatened to dismiss Georgian officers<br>
and NCOs serving under contract in Russian border units on the<br>
Georgian-Turkish border. It has also discontinued the attendance of officer<br>
trainees of Georgian border troops at Russian training centers. (Interfax,<br>
November 20; Iprinda, November 8, 14)<br>
<p>
Georgia has not signed the treaty on "joint protection of CIS external<br>
borders" and has not ratified the bilateral treaty on the stationing of<br>
Russian troops in Georgia. All these issues will probably be discussed again<br>
during the upcoming visit of Russia's Border Service commander, Gen. Andrei<br>
Nikolaev, to Tbilisi. The visit will take place amid an incipient d=8Etente=<br>
 as<br>
Moscow offers some military assistance in the hope of legalizing the<br>
presence of its troops in Georgia.<br>
<p>
GEORGIAN-CHECHEN MEETING OPENS WAY FOR GOOD NEIGHBORLY RELATIONS. Georgia's<br>
ambassador to Russia, Vazha Lordkipanidze, and Chechnya's external relations<br>
minister, Ruslan Kutaev, conferred on November 18 and 19 in Moscow on<br>
developing bilateral relations. The two reached preliminary agreement on a<br>
meeting between Georgian president Eduard Shevardnadze and Chechen<br>
president-in-waiting Zelimkhan Yandarbiev. The Georgians asked the Chechens<br>
to keep the agenda and the results of the meetings confidential for the time<br>
being. (Interfax, November 20) The meetings follow recent Chechen overtures<br>
for a Chechen-Georgian "strategic partnership" that would include<br>
coordinated policies in the Caucasus region. The Chechen leaders abjured<br>
their earlier support for Abkhaz secession and admitted to having been<br>
misled by Moscow into opposing Georgian interests prior to the recent war in<br>
Chechnya. Shevardnadze last week cautiously welcomed the overture while also<br>
signaling that he will not be drawn into an anti-Russian front.<br>

THE ARMY'S PATIENCE IS RUNNING OUT<br>
By Andrei Koliev<br>
<p>
Betrayal: that is the word which characterizes the attitude of Russian<br>
society towards its own army.<br>
<p>
The Army's Financial Situation<br>
	The main blow struck against the army was the destruction of its material<br>
and technical base which came with the dissolution of the USSR. For example,<br>
seven long-range radar stations, each of which, it is estimated, cost five<br>
to seven billion dollars to build, were destroyed. The army's destruction<br>
continues today. The army's budget is only half of what it was in 1992, and<br>
less than one-sixth what it was in 1990, before the USSR's demise.<br>
	According to the 1996 budget, the Ministry of Defense has been allotted<br>
82.4 trillion rubles ($18.3 billion). If half of that sum is spent on the<br>
upkeep of the army and navy (the rest goes to purchases of weapons and other<br>
military equipment, research and development, the pension fund, etc.), then<br>
the cost of the average soldier in uniform is 25.7 million rubles per year<br>
($5,711). In NATO, the corresponding figure is $90,000. Experts think that<br>
the cost of maintaining the average soldier should not drop below $10,000,<br>
or a country's military potential will drop below acceptable levels, without<br>
any hope that it can be revived. This is happening now.<br>
	Moreover, even the hope that the army would be guaranteed at least the<br>
"starvation ration" allotted to it in the budget have proven to be in vain.<br>
Here are the figures. Of the 7.5 trillion rubles allocated for the Ministry<br>
of Defense in 1993, 6.5 trillion rubles were actually paid, in 1994, the<br>
Ministry of Defense did not receive about a third of its appropriation--12<br>
trillion rubles, and in 1995, it did not receive another 7.9 trillion<br>
rubles. In 1996, the money most likely was spent on Boris Yeltsin's<br>
reelection campaign. As a result, the Ministry of Defense, which is now<br>
impoverished and trying to scale back expenses across the board, owes its<br>
personnel and suppliers 16.7 trillion rubles.<br>
	The sums appropriated for the purchase of weapons, other military<br>
equipment, and research and development in 1996 were so miserly that it will<br>
be virtually impossible to reverse the decline of the Russian defense<br>
sector's unique industrial and scientific institutions. As a result of the<br>
shortage of funds, not a single division-level exercise was held in the<br>
Russian army between 1992 and 1996. As regards regimental and battalion<br>
live-fire exercises, in many cases, they have had to be replaced with<br>
headquarters map exercises. And in this case, there is no point even talking<br>
about readiness.<br>
<p>
Pay, Housing, Food Supplies<br>
	There are now more than 125,000 military families without housing. The<br>
government program which guaranteed housing to discharged soldiers from 1993<br>
to 1995, is now practically defunct. Instead of the 85,000 apartments which<br>
were planned to be built in 1995, only 27,000 could be built with the money<br>
that was allocated. In 1996, 7.6 trillion rubles were allocated to housing<br>
construction for the armed forces, which, in the best possible case, will<br>
make it possible to build about 10,000 apartments.<br>
	In August 1996, only 2.3 percent of the amount needed for salaries and<br>
monetary allowances for the Ministry of Defense was allocated. On September<br>
1, the Ministry of Defense owed 6.1 trillion rubles in salaries and monetary<br>
allowances, about 500 billion in subsidies for children, and about 200<br>
billion in payments to victims of Chernobyl.<br>
	The food supply situation in the Armed Forces is close to catastrophic. The<br>
stores of food necessary to supply military personnel have virtually run out<br>
in many military districts and fleets. Even the emergency stores have been<br>
affected. Rations for pilots and submariners are so scanty that they often<br>
do not cover the expenditure of physical energy. In the garrisons of<br>
Dauriya, Borzya, Priargunsk, Drovyanaya, Kandalaksha (above the Arctic<br>
Circle), Sundzha, Gusi-Ozersk, Nerchinsk, Bilitui, Dasatui, Sugol, and<br>
elsewhere, people are starting to starve. And in August, the debt to<br>
bakeries in the Urals Military District alone is 3 billion rubles, and as a<br>
consequence, they refused to supply military units with bread. The situation<br>
is similar in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk and many other garrisons. In total, the<br>
Ministry of Defense owes its food suppliers about 900 billion rubles. Where<br>
will the money come from? Neither the state nor the military has, as yet,<br>
any answer to this question.<br>
<p>
Misappropriation of State Property<br>
	But frequently, the shortage of money in the army is due to its being<br>
stolen. Today, the Chief Military Prosecutor's Office has 11 criminal cases<br>
in which government money has been "diverted" through commercial structures.<br>
The money sent by the Ministry of Defense through the Central Bank of Russia<br>
to the soldiers has disappeared, more than once, from the military<br>
leadership's field of vision. At times, sums sufficient to pay the personnel<br>
of an entire military district for a month have disappeared. In 1994-95, the<br>
scale of this "diversion" of defense money began to grow at a feverish pace.<br>
Not millions, but hundreds of millions of rubles have gotten "stuck," God<br>
knows where.<br>
	The machinations connected with the money from the sale of the property of<br>
the liquidated Western Group of Forces, and its "migration" to the account<br>
of a joint venture in Belgium have become a well-known scandal. $20 million<br>
of the $20.6 million earned from the sale of stocks of arms and military<br>
property in Bulgaria somehow "migrated" to an account in Deutsche Bank. On<br>
November 23, 1995, President Yeltsin, with his Order No. 1175, removed the<br>
head of the Main Military Budget and Finance Administration, Col. Gen. V. V.<br>
Vorobiev,  "for crude financial violations, and unsatisfactory enforcement<br>
of government directives." But Minister of Defense Pavel Grachev prevented<br>
this order from being carried out for several months, and did not permit<br>
audits into the activities of some of his other subordinates.<br>
	Today, the Military Prosecutor's Office is investigating 12 criminal cases<br>
against various generals, including some top military officials. This figure<br>
does not reflect the true level of corruption in the military. After all, a<br>
general here receives a lower salary than a Moscow trolleybus driver.<br>
<p>
On the Brink of a Mutiny<br>
	Over the first seven and a half months of this year, 5,446 crimes were<br>
committed in the Armed Forces, as a result of which 392 servicemen (877 in<br>
1995) died. 123 servicemen committed suicide (304 in 1995). Polls show that<br>
the patience of military men is running out. Ninety-seven percent of<br>
servicemen are dissatisfied with the way the state is caring for its armed<br>
forces. The likelihood of an outbreak of mass protest, and even mutiny, in<br>
the army grows with each passing day.<br>
<p>
Here is only a partial list of protest actions in the army reported in the<br>
press:<br>
<p>
*	Air Defense Forces: the 472nd Fighter Regiment in Kursk. Women blocked an<br>
airstrip 	because their husbands hadn't been paid;<br>
<p>
*	Baltic Fleet: Nevinsk garrison. Servicemen's wives attempted to block the<br>
Kaliningrad-	Bagrationovsk highway, to protest difficult living conditions;<br>
<p>
*	Pacific Fleet: 26th Submarine Division. Servicemen's wives attempted to<br>
prevent 	submarines from going out on patrol, to protest the fact that their<br>
husbands have not been 	paid;<br>
<p>
*	Urals Military District: Ekaterinburg. Servicemen's wives picketed the<br>
city and oblast 	administration building, demanding that salaries be paid;<br>
<p>
*	Space Forces: Commanders have been sued for delays in the payment of salaries;<br>
<p>
*	Air Force: 22nd Guards Heavy Bomber Division in Engels. Servicemen's<br>
wives, with their 	children, blockaded an airstrip, and sent a complaint to<br>
the president and the State Duma;<br>
<p>
*	Strategic Missile Forces: Chitinsk garrison, Units No. 74102 and 44039.<br>
Servicemen and 	their wives are ready to protest after the government's<br>
statement on liquidating its debt to 	budget organizations. They are<br>
planning to block the roads leading to their units;<br>
<p>
	So far, all these actions look like an outbreak of desperation. The army<br>
has escaped mass military protests, possibly with the use of the weapons at<br>
their disposal, by a miracle. But if the situation does not improve<br>
immediately, one may expect hunger riots and the direct expropriation of the<br>
means necessary to support the lives of military units. If the army is<br>
forced to overstep certain clearly-defined moral barriers, social and<br>
political stabilization will become nothing but a bad myth.<br>

ALEKSANDR LEBED: HIS FUTURE COURSE<br>
By Andrei Fedorov<br>
<p>
	The fact that Aleksandr Lebed has been expelled from the Kremlin does not<br>
mean that he is no longer a part of the political life of the country. On<br>
the contrary, he is now free to return to the open fight for votes. And he<br>
will not be limited in his choice of tactics or allies. <br>
	Lebed understands the importance of creating a broad based organization.<br>
Dmitri Rogozin, who was the only one of the general's advisors who had<br>
enough experience and broad enough connections, was made personally<br>
responsible for this. Lebed proceeded from the assumption that it must be a<br>
"union of gosudarstvenniki [moderate nationalists, advocates of Russia as a<br>
great power in the traditional, geopolitical sense]" without any clear<br>
ideological tint. <br>
	At first, the plan was that such a structure would be created in the second<br>
half of October, but the course of events (above all, the condition of the<br>
president's health) forced their hand, and as a result, on September 5,<br>
Russian society got a new political union, "For Truth and Order," which some<br>
pundits jokingly (but with a certain share of seriousness) call the "Swan<br>
Lake" in which each claimant to  power will have to swim.<br>
	How can we assess its position today and its chances in the future?<br>
	This union of three parties is made up of very unequal parts. The Congress<br>
of Russian Communities is, more or less, strong and active. It has an<br>
infrastructure, name recognition, and personnel potential. But in the last<br>
few months, several regional KRO organizations have fallen on hard times and<br>
have become almost completely inactive.<br>
	The Democratic Party of Russia is clearly in decline today, and is in<br>
danger of becoming a dwarf party, a mere shell of its glorious past. In<br>
large part this is because Sergei Glazyev, due to his style of work, cannot<br>
be a proper party leader, and his present work on the Security Council staff<br>
limits his already slim chances to improve the party's situation.<br>
	Lebed's own "party," the "Honor and Dignity" organization, is the weakest<br>
of all, for it has nothing real behind it but the general's image. It will<br>
be almost impossible to turn it into an independent force.<br>
	As regards its chances, there are quite a few interesting factors to<br>
consider. Insofar as Lebed is a rather attractive figure, one may expect<br>
that the growth of the new union will follow the classical Russian scheme --<br>
each week, we will find out that new organizations, such as the "Young<br>
Pathfinders," have joined the bloc, and in the end, Lebed will be able to<br>
speak with pride of how "200 organizations" stand behind him. But for Lebed,<br>
all this is simply for "decor," and he intends to attract serious people by<br>
serious means.<br>
	He doesn't have many possibilities, but there are some. The first, which is<br>
already being explored, is the Russian Popular Union [ROS], led by Sergei<br>
Baburin. In the beginning of August, an agreement was reached between<br>
Lebed's and Baburin's representatives, that the ROS, while formally<br>
remaining independent, will begin the process of rapprochement with the<br>
"Lebed bloc" with the aim of forming a future "non-Communist opposition."<br>
Baburin's opinion that an opposition headed by the Communists has no future<br>
suits Lebed very well.<br>
	By doing this, Lebed is beginning the process of winning over some of the<br>
organizations which were part of the bloc supporting Gennady Zyuganov in the<br>
last presidential elections. Naturally, this is not an "altruistic" process;<br>
the ROS's difficult financial situation is beginning to set itself right,<br>
not without the participation of its "strategic partner."<br>
	Complications could still arise in the relations between them, however,<br>
taking into account the ROS's negative attitude towards Lebed's agreement<br>
with the Chechen separatists.<br>
	On a regional level, attempts are beginning to influence a number of LDPR<br>
organizations, whose leaders, in the southern regions of Russia in<br>
particular, are trying to suggest that Zhirinovsky has already exhausted his<br>
political potential while Lebed still has a historical future. These<br>
conversations are also being backed up by promises to offer more substantial<br>
financial assistance than that which the local Liberal Democrats received<br>
from their leader after the elections. This tactic can be explained above<br>
all by the fact that "at the highest level," there can as yet be no talk of<br>
any mutual understanding between the two parties. Although it is interesting<br>
that the LDPR leader instructed his party, including his party's deputies to<br>
the State Duma, that they need to take a moderate tone when criticizing some<br>
of Lebed's actions.<br>
	Lebed has vague hopes of capturing some of the Communist electorate, but<br>
they are not very high. As the general admitted to one of his friends, he<br>
was shocked by the results of the voting in Novocherkassk, where he had<br>
hoped to defeat Zyuganov. And he drew conclusions from this.<br>
	If you pay close attention, especially to the last two weeks before the<br>
first round of the presidential elections, Lebed, at times, was more of an<br>
anti-Communist than Boris Yeltsin himself. But for the last two months, he<br>
has been noticeably restrained towards the KPRF and its leader. The reason<br>
is simple: foreseeing the possibility of early presidential elections, Lebed<br>
does not want to irritate that portion of the electorate. On the other hand,<br>
the situation could change at any moment, in view of the criticism which the<br>
KPRF and the NPSR [Popular-Patriotic Union of Russia] unleashed against<br>
Lebed's actions in Chechnya.<br>
	The public criticism of the "democrats" uttered by Lebed at the beginning<br>
of September, is, in fact, not so much directed at them as it is a signal to<br>
the "Popular-Patriotic Bloc's" electorate. One may expect that this line<br>
will become more noticeable in the near future.<br>
	The general's recent statement that cooperation on a regional level, and<br>
under certain circumstances, on a national level as well, is even possible<br>
with "Russia is Our Home" is a new factor, the reaction to which has been<br>
ambiguous even within the general's own entourage. The goal is the same: to<br>
try to win over "nationalistically inclined" bureaucrats (which form the<br>
backbone of the local branches of "Russia is Our Home") and, if there are<br>
early presidential elections, to deprive Viktor Chernomyrdin of their<br>
support in the localities and to sow disorder in the Moscow bureaucracy.<br>
	In his attempt to enlist the support of various groups, Lebed has been<br>
forced to reexamine his views with respect to certain politicians. This<br>
applies, above all, to the possibility of a strategic alliance with<br>
Aleksandr Korzhakov. The general recognizes that Anatoly Chubais exploited<br>
him brilliantly in the well-known maneuver which led to the removal of<br>
Korzhakov but is now ready to look at things with different eyes.<br>
	In the first few days of August, a working meeting of representatives of<br>
the "two Aleksandrs" took place in Moscow. At this meeting, a mechanism for<br>
possible cooperation, and the lines along which this cooperation would take<br>
place in the near future, were discussed. In particular, agreements were<br>
reached on the following points:<br>
<p>
*	that the two sides would coordinate their actions and guarantee the mutual<br>
exchange of 	information;<br>
*	that Korzhakov would run for Lebed's seat in the State Duma from Tula, and<br>
that Lebed 	would make a statement supporting the president's former<br>
security chief;<br>
*	that Korzhakov and his people would join Lebed's campaign staff if there<br>
are early 	presidential elections; and<br>
*	that Korzhakov and the structures close to him would take part in<br>
financing Lebed's 	campaign.<br>
	<br>
	It is absolutely obvious that there is a very serious reason for such an<br>
alliance. And it is not simply that they have a common enemy -- Chubais<br>
(although that brought the two together). It is much more important that<br>
Korzhakov has placed his bets on Lebed as the politician who best reflects<br>
the interests of that group of "new government patriots," whom the president<br>
recently accused of "taking a lot, but giving little back." And besides,<br>
Korzhakov didn't have much of a choice -- it wasn't as if he could go to<br>
Zyuganov or Yavlinsky.<br>
	Lebed gets a lot out of this alliance and therefore, at his personal<br>
meeting with Korzhakov which followed these negotiations, they were able to<br>
reach a mutual understanding.<br>
	His main rival at the present moment is Anatoly Chubais, who is able to<br>
block the activity of Lebed and his people on a number of fronts.<br>
	Lebed sees Gennady Zyuganov as a much more serious rival, understanding the<br>
potential of his electorate, and the fact that, in many cases, they "play on<br>
the same field." While doing all he can to attract Russians who support the<br>
KPRF, all the same Lebed has unequivocally decided that he will not be<br>
forming any alliance with Zyuganov at the present time. As regards the<br>
future, the situation is more complicated, and much may depend on what the<br>
political situation is if there are early presidential elections. Zyuganov,<br>
on his part, quite justly fears that Lebed, if he were elected president,<br>
would prove to be even more authoritarian than Yeltsin. It suffices to<br>
recall his statement that "running the country with the help of parliament<br>
is nothing but a madhouse."<br>
	His relations with his other political rival, Viktor Chernomyrdin, who is<br>
the second most powerful man in the country, and clearly has no desire to<br>
part with that position for the theoretical chance of becoming the first,<br>
are more complicated. The last month has shown that Chernomyrdin has clearly<br>
outplayed Lebed in the bureaucratic game, and that his team has much more<br>
potential than the general's team. A weakening of the premier's position,<br>
which could arise as the result of the growing number of strikes would<br>
objectively benefit Lebed today.<br>
<p>
MONEY DECIDES QUITE A BIT*<br>
	Another conclusion that Lebed drew from the results of the elections was<br>
that without a serious financial base, no amount of charisma can guarantee<br>
victory. If it were not for the political wisdom of Anatoly Chubais, who<br>
gave the order to finance the last stage of Lebed's campaign liberally, and<br>
to open up access for him to all the mass media, the general's results would<br>
have been a little more modest. Lebed addressed the question of financing<br>
his future presidential campaign immediately after coming to the Kremlin.<br>
	Lebed's team's financial position today can be called mediocre. He has<br>
money in the bank, which is earning a high rate of interest. According to<br>
various sources, this amounts to approximately six to seven million dollars.<br>
	And then there is money whose roots lead to the 14th Army. This money is<br>
located outside the country and is controlled by people close to Lebed. One<br>
of them now lives in Serbia and is actively involved in various financial<br>
operations.<br>
	And there is so-called "potential money," i.e., sums which certain banking,<br>
financial, and industrial structures say they are ready to allocate to the<br>
general's campaign. But here, Lebed is being rather choosy and deliberate,<br>
in view of the fact that there are quite a few firms offering their<br>
financial services.<br>
	His main "horse" is the well-known Moscow bank "Inkombank," whose leader<br>
[Vladimir Vinogradov] was singled out not so long ago, without any special<br>
reason, by Lebed while speaking to the Federation Council. Despite the fact<br>
that this institution's financial situation is not all that good at the<br>
present time, it has high potential, and it could improve noticeably.<br>
	Characteristically, Mr. Vinogradov, on his recent visit to Primorye,<br>
conducted rather active "explanatory" work with certain Moscow and regional<br>
colleagues on the theme of "you know who."<br>
	But in such games, there has to be more than one "horse," and therefore,<br>
Logovaz has been added as "insurance" (although here, the information<br>
possibilities which arise from cooperating with this structure are much more<br>
important).<br>
	It is interesting that a giant of the Russian financial world like Most<br>
Bank has had its informal offer of assistance refused. There are several<br>
reasons for this, and they are well-known to those who follow this process<br>
from the inside. First of all, Lebed does not want to be linked publicly<br>
with financiers who could harm his reputation as a "different kind of<br>
Russian politician." Second, he knows that if, in the future presidential<br>
race, his paths cross with those of [Moscow mayor] Yuri Luzhkov, that Most<br>
will give objective preference to the latter. The only way to work with this<br>
bank would be the formula "Lebed for president, Luzhkov for premier." It is<br>
quite possible that informal contacts have already begun on this theme. But<br>
another series of appeals made by several prominent bankers to Sergei<br>
Glazyev and Dmitri Rogozin have so far remained unanswered.<br>
	At the same time, the process of attracting new "potential money" from<br>
regional banking structures has begun. In the last month, Lebed's<br>
representatives have met with businessmen and bankers in Stavropol,<br>
Krasnodar, Volgograd, and St. Petersburg. This doesn't represent all that<br>
much money, but for the possible presidential elections, it is important to<br>
have such channels.<br>
	There is another reserve, which one may speak of, with certain<br>
reservations. This is Chechnya. During my recent meeting with one of Aslan<br>
Maskhadov's assistants, he said something like this: "If everything turns<br>
out as Lebed has promised us, there can be no doubt that his presidential<br>
campaign will be well-financed." I have no doubt about that either.<br>
	Moreover, if the alliance with Korzhakov still becomes a political reality,<br>
Lebed will have at his disposal enormous sums of money, coming from a number<br>
of organizations under Korzhakov's control, above all, the well-known<br>
National Sports Fund.<br>
	 No matter what Lebed says, now it is obvious that he has begun his<br>
presidential campaign. How can we forget his words of five months ago: "My<br>
ambitions are higher than ministerial. I am sick of carrying out idiotic<br>
orders. Now, I'll be the one doing the commanding."<br>
	He had begun earlier than others for obvious reasons. If the other serious<br>
candidates -- Chernomyrdin, Luzhkov, and Zyuganov -- do not have Lebed's<br>
charisma, they have something else: more substantial structures, people, and<br>
much more money than the general. Lebed fears that the race may start<br>
unexpectedly quickly, and under conditions which are unfavorable to him. To<br>
take third place a second time and become, once again, a "card to be played"<br>
does not suit him. Therefore, he is getting himself ready for the fight for<br>
first place.<br>

LEBED IN NEW YORK. In his first visit to the U.S., former Kremlin security<br>
supremo Aleksandr Lebed met yesterday in New York with members of the<br>
Council on Foreign Relations. Lebed warned them that "the wrong people"<br>
could get access to Russia's nuclear arsenal, and called for greater Western<br>
financial aid to strengthen Russia's nuclear security. Lebed also said that<br>
he plans a return to politics and has set up his own party based in Tula,<br>
where he was elected to parliament last December. (RTR, November 19; BBC<br>

RUSSIA'S POTANIN TO PRESENT EUROBONDS IN NEW YORK. First Deputy Premier<br>
Vladimir Potanin is in New York to promote Russia's forthcoming eurobond --<br>
the country's first international financing since 1917. (Itar-Tass, November<br>
19) Interest was high last week when Finance Minister Aleksandr Livshits<br>
made a series of presentations in Western European financial centers, even<br>
though details remain vague about the precise date of issue, prices and<br>
potential yields. (Financial Times, November 18)<br>

SEARCH ABANDONED IN DAGESTAN BUILDING COLLAPSE. Rescue operations ceased<br>
yesterday at the site of the November 16 explosion in a block of military<br>
apartments in Dagestan. In all, 106 people were recovered from the rubble.<br>
Of those, 68 were dead, 20 of them children. The cause of the blast is still<br>
unknown. Accidental causes have not been ruled out. (Itar-Tass, NTV,<br>
November 19)<br>
<p>
HOUSE REPUBLICANS VOICE CONCERN OVER MURDER. Congressional GOP leaders sent<br>
a letter to Russia's president on November 18 expressing shock at the recent<br>
murder of U.S. businessman Paul Tatum. The letter also warned that the<br>
shooting could jeopardize American aid to Russia, and it said that the<br>
general "atmosphere of unrestrained crime" in Russia undermines U.S.<br>
willingness to do business there. Tatum is a former GOP activist who was<br>
involved in law suits over ownership of a major Russian hotel. (AP, November 18)<br>
<p>
RUSSIA DENIES HELPING SYRIA WITH CHEMICAL WEAPONS. The Russian Foreign<br>
Ministry yesterday denied the recent Israeli charge that Russian scientists<br>
were helping Syria manufacture chemical weapons. (See Monitor, November<br>
19).Ministry spokesman Mikhail Demurin said the charge was "absolutely<br>
groundless," and complained that such statements are "totally destructive<br>
from the point of view of priorities of the peace process in the Middle<br>
East." (Interfax, November 19)<br>
<p>
NEW HELICOPTER GUNSHIP UNVEILED. The Ka-52 "Alligator" was unveiled by the<br>
Kamov helicopter design bureau yesterday. It is a two-seat version of the<br>
Ka-50 "Black Shark" that incorporates some Western avionics. Kamov hopes to<br>
sell it to the Russian ground and air forces and to market it abroad. It<br>
will be built at the Arsenyev plant in Primorye. Arsenyev has had little<br>
success in getting the Russian military to buy the Ka-50. (Interfax,<br>

NUCLEAR CRUISER HEADS FOR THE OPEN OCEANS. The recently completed<br>
nuclear-powered battle cruiser Pyotr Veliky is heading for the Northern<br>
Fleet to finish its sea trials, a Russian naval spokesman announced<br>
yesterday. The ship has had a stormy history so far. It triggered an<br>
international incident when sailing past Latvia in the Baltic, then a<br>
Swedish jet fighter crashed while looking the ship over, and finally a steam<br>
line ruptured killing 5 sailors and workers. (Interfax, November 19)<br>

WASHINGTON PROTESTS OVER NICHOLSON SPY INCIDENT. The U.S. protested<br>
officially to Moscow yesterday over its "unacceptable" role in the espionage<br>
activities of Harold Nicholson, the 16-year CIA veteran arrested over the<br>
weekend for passing secret information to Russia. According to a State<br>
Department spokesman, U.S. deputy secretary of state Strobe Talbott called<br>
in Yuly Vorontsov, the Russian ambassador to Washington, to convey the<br>
Administration's displeasure, while the U.S. Embassy in Moscow delivered a<br>
parallel protest. The spokesman said that Washington views the Nicholson<br>
incident as "inconsistent with the pattern of bilateral relations of recent<br>
years" and he made clear that the U.S. is considering appropriate measures<br>
in response. In Moscow, neither Russia's Foreign Ministry nor its Foreign<br>
Intelligence Service would comment on the affair (Reuter, Itar-Tass,<br>
November 19)<br>
<p>
Intelligence personnel in the U.S. were said to have been particularly<br>
stunned by several aspects of the Nicholson case. The first was that<br>
Nicholson chose brazenly to launch his espionage activities less than eight<br>
weeks after the conviction of Aldrich Ames, the most notorious spy in CIA<br>
history. Indeed, the timing of Nicholson's apparent recruitment -- believed<br>
now to have occurred during a 1994 trip Malaysia -- suggests that Moscow may<br>
have used to its advantage the uproar created in the CIA over the Ames case.<br>
CIA personnel have also been left to ponder the fact that Nicholson, unlike<br>
the burned-out Ames, had been a rising star who seemed likely to reach the<br>
highest ranks of the agency's hierarchy. Equally surprising was the fact<br>
that a trusted instructor at the CIA's spy training center in Virginia would<br>
sell to Moscow the identities of some of the agency's officers and foreign<br>
agents, including one man that he had trained to spy for the U.S. in Moscow. <br>
<p>
As a former station chief, Nicholson is the highest-ranking CIA employee<br>
ever to be charged with espionage. Intelligence agency representatives are<br>
saying, however, that while Nicholson's spying activities are serious, they<br>
appear to be far less damaging than were those perpetrated by Ames. More<br>
than a dozen agents working for the CIA are believed to have been executed<br>
as a result of information supplied by Ames. (The New York Times, November 19)<br>
<p>
YELTSIN MEETS WITH PRIME MINISTER. President Boris Yeltsin and Prime<br>
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin met for one hour on November 19, their first<br>
working meeting since Yeltsin's surgery. Chernomyrdin was at pains to stress<br>
that it was a "working" meeting and that Yeltsin was fully informed of all<br>
developments. Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin is<br>
likely to move this week from the Central Clinic to the Barvikha sanitarium<br>
near Moscow, where he will spend about a month before returning to the<br>
Kremlin. (Itar-Tass, November 19) Yastrzhembsky did not say when Yeltsin<br>
will make the address to the nation originally planned for last week. It is<br>
believed to have been postponed due to the uproar that followed the recent<br>
publication of potentially incriminating Kremlin tapes. (See Monitor,<br>
November 18)<br>
<p>
Yeltsin's spokesman said the president reacted calmly to the results of last<br>
weekend's regional elections, in which the pro-Yeltsin incumbent was<br>
defeated by the Communist challenger in strategically vital Stavropol krai.<br>
The Kremlin is putting a brave face on recent electoral results, arguing<br>
that almost all those who have been elected are pragmatists with whom Moscow<br>
can do business. Using this yardstick, Yastrzhembsky put the score at "15 to<br>
4" in the Kremlin's favor.<br>
<p>
Chernomyrdin told reporters that he and Yeltsin had discussed the peace<br>
process in Chechnya and that some work still remains to be done on documents<br>
he plans to sign with Chechen premier Aslan Maskhadov. Ahmed Zakaev, aide to<br>
Chechen president Zelimkhan Yandarbiev, said yesterday that a draft treaty<br>
on relations between Moscow and the Chechen republic is "almost ready for<br>
signing." Zakaev said the treaty will mark "an important and concrete step<br>
towards normalization of relations between Russia and Chechnya." According<br>
to Chechen deputy premier Ruslan Kutaev, the major outstanding problem<br>
centers on Chechnya's demand that Russia withdraw all federal forces from<br>
Chechen territory prior to the elections scheduled for January, 1997.<br>
(Itar-Tass, November 19)<br>
<p>
KABARDINO-BALKARIA TO TAKE SLEDGEHAMMER TO BALKAR NUT. Authorities in the<br>
southern Russian republic of Kabardino-Balkaria have reacted with something<br>
like panic to last weekend's declaration of a "sovereign Republic of<br>
Balkaria." (See Monitor, November 19) Kabardino-Balkaria's parliament met<br>
yesterday in emergency session and dissolved the Council of the Balkar<br>
People, which was responsible for proclaiming the breakaway Balkar state.<br>
Police sealed the Council's offices and the republic prosecutor launched<br>
criminal proceedings against its leaders. The Russian Duma immediately<br>
dispatched a team of deputies to the republic to investigate. Although<br>
Balkar leaders had stressed that they wanted to remain within the Russian<br>
Federation, reactions in both Kabardino-Balkaria and Moscow appear to be<br>
influenced by a determination to ward off any repetition of the Chechen<br>
scenario. Only the Yeltsin administration reacted calmly, with presidential<br>
spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky warning against "overdramatizing"<br>
developments. (Itar-Tass, November 19) This is the third time since 1991<br>
that Balkar activists have threatened to separate from Kabardino-Balkaria,<br>
and their latest attempt is believed to have been sparked by the fact that<br>
all official posts of any importance in the republic have gone to Kabardins<br>
or Slavs, with none going to Balkars, who make up ten percent of the<br>
population. In the past, ordinary Balkars have not supported their leaders'<br>
declarations of independence.<br>
<p>
NORTH OSSETIAN AND INGUSH PRESIDENTS AGREE: MOSCOW IS TO BLAME FOR THEIR<br>
PROBLEMS. The upper house of the Russian parliament, the Federation Council,<br>
has unanimously adopted a resolution "On Measures to Overcome the<br>
Consequences of the Ossetian-Ingush Conflict of October-November 1992."<br>
(Interfax, November 14) The resolution aims to resolve a territorial<br>
conflict between Ingushetia and neighboring North Ossetia dating back to<br>
1944, when Stalin deported the Ingush and the Chechens from their north<br>
Caucasus homelands and abolished the republic that bore their name. The<br>
deportees were allowed to return only in the mid-1950s and, to add insult to<br>
injury, the traditionally Ingush-occupied Prigorodny district was not<br>
returned to them but was instead transferred to North Ossetia. It has been a<br>
source of discord ever since. Resentment boiled over in 1992, when bloody<br>
confrontations between Ingush and Ossetians led to a mass exodus of ethnic<br>
Ingush from North Ossetia. Thousands of refugees are still waiting to return<br>
home and Ingushetia remains committed to regaining the territory by peaceful<br>
means.<br>
<p>
President Ruslan Aushev of Ingushetia told the Monitor this week, however,<br>
that he is not hopeful that the Federation Council's resolution will help to<br>
resolve the conflict. "The first document to define Ingushetia's borders was<br>
the law on the formation of the Ingush Republic, dated June 4, 1992.<br>
Unfortunately, nothing was done at that time. Later, there were the<br>
Federation Council's instructions, which were not obeyed. This resolution<br>
will not be obeyed either," Aushev told the Monitor.<br>
<p>
"There have been many such resolutions... The government won't define<br>
anything... I've heard this talk for the last five years," North Ossetian<br>
president Akhsarbek Galazov confirmed in an interview with the Monitor. "The<br>
boundaries of North Ossetia were defined long ago. Prigorodny district is<br>
part of North Ossetia," Galazov said. Naturally, Aushev does not share this<br>
opinion. "There is no law on the border between North Ossetia and the<br>
Chechen-Ingush republic restored in 1957! And consequently, the Ossetians'<br>
claims to Prigorodny raion are unfounded," he reasoned.<br>
<p>
But both presidents believe (although Galazov is more cautious in his<br>
assessments) that Moscow is chiefly to blame for the unsolved<br>
Ossetian-Ingush problem. "We are sending back Ingush refugees, because we<br>
cannot support them. In 1996, Moscow gave us only 13.5 billion rubles for<br>
the housing destroyed in North Ossetia during the 1992 conflict, only 13.5<br>
million out of the 930 billion rubles to which we were entitled." Galazov<br>
told the Monitor. Aushev, too, is convinced that "Moscow is to blame for<br>
what is happening to the Ingush people. We don't blame the North Ossetian<br>
leadership, much less the Ossetian people!" <br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
LUKASHENKO LOSING GROUND BUT NOT RESOLVE IN CONFRONTATION WITH PARLIAMENT<br>
AND COURT. The Constitutional Court of Belarus yesterday began deliberations<br>
on a motion, signed by more than  70 parliamentary deputies, to initiate<br>
impeachment proceedings against President Aleksandr Lukashenko for multiple<br>
violations of the law. The parliamentary motion and the Court's deliberation<br>
on it are the first two steps provided by law in the procedure to impeach<br>
and depose the president. Lukashenko's removal, however, would require a<br>
two-thirds majority in the legislature. <br>
<p>
Support for Lukashenko also seems to be eroding in the executive branch.<br>
Prime Minister Mikhail Chigir, Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Sannikau, and<br>
Labor Minister Aleksandr Sosnau have resigned in the last two days, and<br>
Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Col. Mikalay Krechka has been dismissed<br>
by the president. Lukashenko yesterday appointed first deputy prime minister<br>
Syarhey Ling as acting prime minister. The president reaffirmed in a speech,<br>
also yesterday, his intention to proceed unilaterally with a referendum<br>
fashioned to give him sweeping powers. (Belaplan, Radio Minsk, Interfax,<br>
November 19)<br>
<p>
UKRAINE HOPES NEW ROMANIAN GOVERNMENT WILL RECOGNIZE EXISTING BORDERS.<br>
Ukrainian Foreign Ministry envoy for special assignments Volodymyr Vasilenko<br>
stated yesterday that Kiev hopes for Romanian recognition of Ukraine's<br>
territorial integrity following the election of Emil Constantinescu as<br>
Romanian president. Vasilenko noted that Constantinescu's campaign<br>
emphasized the goal of Romania's early accession to NATO and the European<br>
Union as a high priority. The two organizations require countries aspiring<br>
for membership to drop territorial claims on their neighbors and to sign<br>
treaties of good-neighborly relations, Vasilenko pointed out. He expressed<br>
hope that Bucharest would now move "as expeditiously as possible" to<br>
recognize Ukraine's borders and finalize the negotiations toward a bilateral<br>
political treaty. Also yesterday, Ukraine's first deputy foreign minister,<br>
Anton Buteyko, speaking to the North Atlantic Assembly, expressed hope for<br>
an improvement in relations with Romania. But Buteyko asked NATO to defer<br>
consideration of Romania's accession to the alliance pending Bucharest's<br>
recognition of Ukraine's borders in a bilateral treaty. (Interfax-Ukraine,<br>
November 19)<br>
<p>
The Western-oriented Constantinescu and his Democratic Convention defeated<br>
incumbent president Ion Iliescu and his leftist coalition in this month's<br>
presidential and parliamentary elections. Bucharest until now has directly<br>
or indirectly affirmed its perceived title to parts of Bessarabia, Bukovina<br>
and to Serpents' Island, which have been part of Ukraine since the<br>
dissolution of the USSR. Negotiations toward a Ukrainian-Romanian bilateral<br>
treaty are stalled over Bucharest's demand that the document reflect its<br>
position on those territories.<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
ARMENIA'S CONSTITUTIONAL COURT BLOCKING REVIEW OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION<br>
RETURNS. Armenian opposition representatives yesterday charged at a news<br>
conference that the Constitutional Court "practically covers up the<br>
falsification of the presidential election returns" in its handling of the<br>
opposition's petition for a detailed review of those returns. The Court has<br>
declined to examine the protocols of individual electoral precincts for<br>
suspected fraud, has accepted to hear only one out of more than 60<br>
opposition witnesses, and has blocked access to the records of voting in<br>
military units, the opposition plaintiffs said. The government-controlled<br>
Central Election Commission, acting as defendant in the case before the<br>
Court, is successfully resisting the opposition's requests to open election<br>
records for examination. In its presentation to the Court the CEC also<br>
rejected a report by the OSCE's election monitors, describing it as<br>
ill-informed and a reflection only of private opinions. (Noyan-Tapan,<br>
Armenpress, Interfax, November 18-19) <br>
<p>
OSCE and other international monitors determined that Armenian authorities<br>
resorted to fraud in producing a narrow victory for incumbent president<br>
Levon Ter-Petrosian in the September 22 election. The opposition has<br>
petitioned the Constitutional Court to examine the evidence of fraud, some<br>
of which the opposition itself collected and submitted. The Court and the<br>
CEC are known to be politically loyal to the president and the ruling party.<br>
The opposition is under no illusion on that score, but has pursued this<br>
avenue of redress mainly in order to demonstrate its adherence to legal<br>
processes after its supporters stormed the parliament and the CEC office to<br>
protest the fraud.<br>
<p>
GEORGIAN "ZVIADISTS" SENTENCED. Loti Kobalia, former commander of the late<br>
president Zviad Gamsakhurdia's paramilitary force, was sentenced to death<br>
yesterday by Georgia's Supreme Court on charges of high treason, banditry,<br>
and the commission of premeditated murders. The Court also sentenced former<br>
parliamentary deputies Jambul Bokuchava, Zviad Dzidziguri, and Nugzar<br>
Molodinashvili on similar charges to "severe-regime" prison terms of 15, 13,<br>
and seven years, respectively. The charges stem mostly from the defendants'<br>
roles in the 1993 uprising staged by "Zviadists" (Gamsakhurdia's supporters)<br>
in western Georgia in an effort to return the deposed president to power.<br>
Gamsakhurdia committed suicide after the defeat of his forces. <br>
<p>
The trial lasted a whole year and was punctuated by Zviadist protests inside<br>
and outside the courtroom, as was again the case yesterday. The defendants<br>
maintained throughout the process that they had represented and defended<br>
lawful state power against its alleged usurpation by Eduard Shevardnadze,<br>
whom Zviadists refuse to recognize as president. Their Round Table-Free<br>
Georgia Movement is, however, a spent force at present.<br>
<p>
The death sentence against Kobalia will spark controversy but is unlikely to<br>
be carried out. Only two days ago Shevardnadze stated on radio that Georgia<br>
is observing a de facto moratorium on the death penalty as part of the<br>
effort to qualify for admission to the Council of Europe. During the last<br>
two years the courts have handed down more than 30 death sentences, but none<br>
has been carried out, Shevardnadze observed. (Interfax, November 19; Radio<br>
Tbilisi, November 18)<br>

MOLDOVA BRACES FOR PRESIDENTIAL RUNOFF. Final results, issued today, of the<br>
November 17 first round of Moldova's presidential election show incumbent<br>
president Mircea Snegur with 39 percent of the votes cast, Parliament<br>
Chairman Petru Lucinschi with 28 percent, Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli and<br>
Communist leader Vladimir Voronin with 10 percent each, pro-Romanian<br>
candidate Valeriu Matei with 9 percent, and four minor candidates with<br>
smaller percentages. Turnout was strong, at 68 percent, despite the<br>
Transdniester authorities' refusal to open polling stations in that region.<br>
The governing Agrarian Democratic party has endorsed Lucinschi for the<br>
December 1 runoff on the grounds that "Moldova's statehood is at stake"<br>
following Snegur's alliance with the pro-Romanian Popular Front. (Monitor<br>
interviews, November 19)<br>
<p>
NEIGHBORS OF BELARUS CONCERNED. The Belarusan parliament remained in session<br>
overnight, fearful that president Aleksandr Lukashenko's security forces --<br>
deployed around the building -- might seize it if the deputies left. The<br>
Foreign Ministries of Poland and Lithuania yesterday issued statements<br>
expressing concern over the crisis in Belarus and urging respect for the<br>
constitution and democratic principles. Clearly targeting Lukashenko, the<br>
ministries stressed that Belarus' neighbors are interested in its<br>
development as a European state based on the rule of law. (Interfax, Western<br>
agencies, November 18)<br>
<p>
DEATH TOLL RISES IN DAGESTAN EXPLOSION, SUSPECT DETAINED. The death toll<br>
following the November 16 bomb blast in the Caspian Sea coastal town of<br>
Kaspiisk has reached 50 as rescue workers continue to search the rubble for<br>
survivors and victims. A person suspected of staging the blast has been<br>
detained, Itar-Tass reported. The identity of the suspect has not been<br>
revealed. (UPI, Reuters, Interfax, Itar-Tass, November 18)<br>
<p>
RUSSIA LOST MILLIONS IN FAILED MARS PROBE. Russia had invested $122 million<br>
in the failed Mars-'96 space probe while other countries had contributed<br>
more than $180 million to the project, a senior Russian space official<br>
revealed yesterday. According to Yuri Milov, deputy director of the Russian<br>
Space Agency, Ukraine had also spent more than $1 million in the<br>
multi-national effort. (Interfax, November 18. See Monitor, November 18)<br>
<p>
TAJIK PRESIDENT GETS ACCOLADE FROM MOSCOW MAYOR. On a "working visit" to<br>
Moscow yesterday, Tajik president Imomali Rahmonov was received discreetly<br>
by Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and with fanfare by Moscow<br>
mayor Yuri Luzhkov. Rahmonov and Luzhkov agreed that Tajikistan will<br>
increase cotton deliveries to Moscow, while Moscow will assist Tajik<br>
industrial plants that employ ethnic Russians. (Interfax, November 18) The<br>
political connotation of the agreement reflects the nationalist position<br>
that presidential hopeful Luzhkov is staking out on "near abroad" issues in<br>
general.<br>
<p>
TURKMEN PRESIDENT UNDERGOES HEALTH CHECK IN ISTANBUL. Doctors at a U.S.-run<br>
clinic in Istanbul have completed a checkup--"with a cardiac emphasis" -- of<br>
Turkmenistan's president Saparmurad Niazov. The doctors are cited as<br>
describing Niazov's condition as "generally satisfactory" and recommending<br>
regular checkups twice a year. Niazov was received by Turkish president<br>
Suleyman Demirel before the medical examination. (Ankara TV, November 17) In<br>
1994 Niazov was operated on in the U.S. for a circulatory problem. <br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
CIA VETERAN CHARGED WITH PASSING SECRETS TO MOSCOW. Only days after the<br>
resolution of a major U.S.-Russian espionage row, American authorities<br>
yesterday charged a former CIA station chief with spying for Moscow. Harold<br>
J. Nicholson, aged 46 and a 16-year CIA veteran, had allegedly passed "very<br>
damaging information" to the Russians, for which he was reportedly paid more<br>
than $120,000. Nicholson was hired by the CIA in 1980 and had held high<br>
security clearance throughout much of his career. As an overseas agent<br>
against the Soviet Union and other countries, Nicholson reportedly had his<br>
first contact with targeted Soviet officials while serving in Manila from<br>
1982-1985. Nicholson was subsequently CIA station chief in Bucharest, and<br>
from 1994 until July of this year instructed new CIA agents in tradecraft at<br>
the agency's secret Virginia training site. U.S. authorities, who are still<br>
assessing the scope of Nicholson's alleged crimes, indicated that his<br>
espionage activities had begun at least by early 1994, and may have started<br>
years before that. According to the FBI, Nicholson had been granted access<br>
to information whose disclosure could do irreparable harm to the U.S. If<br>
convicted Nicholson faces life in prison without parole. (AP, The New York<br>
Times, November 18)<br>
<p>
Federal authorities said that there was no evidence of any connection<br>
between the Nicholson case and that of Aldrich Ames, the U.S.<br>
counterintelligence officer who was arrested in early 1994 and is now<br>
serving a life sentence for passing secrets to the Soviet Union. But<br>
Attorney General Janet Reno, CIA Director John Deutch, and FBI Director<br>
Louis Freeh all attributed Nicholson's arrest to a policy of improved<br>
cooperation between the FBI and CIA that was implemented in the wake of the<br>
Ames case. (AP, November 18) Ironically, it was poor coordination between<br>
those same two agencies that was cited as one reason for the recent spy row<br>
between Washington and Moscow over the arrest -- and subsequent release --<br>
by U.S. authorities of a former Soviet intelligence officer. (See Monitor,<br>
November 18)<br>
<p>
A RUSSIAN CONNECTION IN SYRIAN CHEMICAL WEAPONS PROGRAM? Israeli defense<br>
minister Yitzhak Mordechai on Saturday accused Syria of building nerve gas<br>
weapons with the help of Russian scientists. He warned that Israel, widely<br>
acknowledged to possess nuclear weapons, would "destroy" the regime of<br>
President Assad if those chemical weapons were ever used against Israel.<br>
<p>
The potential proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, abetted by<br>
disgruntled and poorly paid Russian scientists, has been one of the<br>
nightmares of the post-Cold War era. And there has been some evidence that<br>
at least one Russian with strong ties to Russia's chemical weapons complex<br>
has looked to the Middle East for profit. Both the U.S. and Russian<br>
authorities have investigated retired Lt. Gen. Anatoly Kuntsevich -- who<br>
once headed the Russian Army's Chemical Troops and is a member of the<br>
Academy of Sciences -- on the suspicion that in 1993 he smuggled 800<br>
kilograms of toxic chemicals to an unnamed country in the Middle East. It<br>
was also revealed that he tried but failed to smuggle out an even larger<br>
shipment of chemicals in 1994. (AP, October 23, 1995)<br>
<p>
The Russians dropped the charges against Kuntsevich just last month.<br>
(Nezavisimaya gazeta, October 15) The U.S. was not as easy on him. In<br>
November 1995 the Clinton Administration imposed sanctions on Kuntsevich<br>
"for knowingly providing material assistance to a foreign chemical weapons<br>
program." The recipient of Kuntsevich's shipment has not been made public.<br>
Unfortunately, there are several other likely candidates in addition to<br>
Syria. Both Iraq and Libya are known to have covert chemical weapons<br>
programs. Until the smuggling scandal broke last year, moreover, Kuntsevich<br>
had run as a candidate for parliament under ultra-nationalist Vladimir<br>
Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party. Zhirinovsky has long called for<br>
Moscow to renew its Soviet-era ties with the radical Arab states, and the<br>
mercurial Russian politician has not had an unkind word to say about the<br>
rulers of Iraq, Libya, or Syria. <br>
<p>
"SOVEREIGN REPUBLIC OF BALKARIA" IS PROCLAIMED. Authorities in the north<br>
Caucasus Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria have responded decisively to last<br>
weekend's declaration of a sovereign Republic of Balkaria. Criminal<br>
proceedings have been launched against the organizers of the Congress of the<br>
Balkar People, which proclaimed the new republic on November 17. In a<br>
televised appearance, the president of Kabardino-Balkaria, Valery Kokov,<br>
vowed to use "all legal means" to fight separatism and prevent the<br>
destabilization of the republic. (Interfax, RTR, November 17-18)<br>
<p>
This is the Balkars' third attempt to create an independent republic. The<br>
Balkars and the Kabardins are both indigenous to the northern Caucasus, but<br>
they are not related to one another culturally or linguistically. The<br>
Balkars make up less than 10 percent of the population of<br>
Kabardino-Balkaria. They live in the mountainous territory in the south of<br>
the republic and have long complained of discrimination. The Kabardins, who<br>
make up 40 percent of the population, live mainly in the northern plain and<br>
foothill regions. The Soviet government laid a time-bomb in 1922, when it<br>
created two bordering republics of Karachaevo-Cherkessia and<br>
Kabardino-Balkaria. Neither the Balkars, who are closely related to the<br>
Karachais, nor the Kabardins, who are closely related to the Cherkess, were<br>
happy with this territorial arrangement. The situation was exacerbated when,<br>
in 1944, the Balkars and the Karachais, together with the Chechens and the<br>
Ingush, were deported by Stalin. In the 1980s several congresses of the<br>
Balkar and Karachai peoples adopted resolutions calling for the creation of<br>
their own national republics.<br>
<p>
Kabardino-Balkaria is separated from Chechnya by only a few dozen kilometers<br>
of North Ossetian territory. If, moreover, there are disturbances in<br>
Kabardino-Balkaria, there is a danger that the situation in<br>
Karachaevo-Cherkessia will also be destabilized. Professor Musu Shanibov, a<br>
member of the Kabardin People's Congress' executive committee, told the<br>
Monitor that "after the end of military operations in Chechnya, strange<br>
things have begun to happen. First, the situation was destabilized in<br>
Dagestan, and after that, in Kabardino-Balkaria. A belt of instability is<br>
being created around Chechnya. This is especially inspired from the Center<br>
[i.e., Moscow]. The 'party of war' is not interested in peace coming to the<br>
Northern Caucasus." There are reasons, however, to doubt whether the<br>
majority of the Balkars living in Kabardino-Balkaria support the call of<br>
last weekend's Congress for independence. Ideally, perhaps, the Balkars<br>
would like their own state, but in the past the majority of the Balkars have<br>
not supported calls to split the republic.<br>
<p>
MORE SUPPORT FOR RUSSIA'S AGROINDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. Russian deputy prime<br>
minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha said on November 17 that Russia's food and<br>
agricultural producers had strengthened their position in the domestic<br>
market. Production of cereals has increased, he said, as has output of a<br>
such food products as sugar, children's food, margarine, and tobacco.<br>
Zaveryukha claimed that domestic producers are becoming increasingly<br>
responsive to market forces and more adept at working in a competitive<br>
environment. (Interfax, November 17) <br>
<p>
Despite this rosy picture, however, the Russian government intends to<br>
implement new forms of state support for the agricultural and food sector.<br>
According to Minister of Agriculture Viktor Khlystun, a federal<br>
stabilization program for the agroindustrial complex in 1996-2000 has been<br>
adopted. It will channel some 10 trillion rubles into a fund for the<br>
concession of privileged credits, to be granted at a refinancing rate only<br>
25 percent that of Russia's Central Bank. The minister also demanded a<br>
better system of protections for domestic producers and a change in taxation<br>
for the agricultural sector. (Interfax, November 17) On November 14 Russian<br>
foreign trade minister Oleg Davydov said that Russian imports of sugar will<br>
be cut to 1.5 million tons per year, of which 1.15 will come from Ukraine.<br>
The introduction of such quotas is motivated by the desire to provide<br>
protection for domestic refineries and to give them time to increase their<br>
competitiveness, Davydov said. He added that the measure is provisional and<br>
that the quotas will be removed "after a while." (Itar-Tass, November 14)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
BREAKTHROUGH REPORTED ON CRIMEAN CONSTITUTION. Ukrainian and Crimean<br>
lawmakers, meeting in Kiev on November 16, are reported to have reached<br>
agreement on almost all the disputed articles in Crimea's draft<br>
constitution. The constitution was adopted by the Crimean parliament in<br>
November 1995, but the Ukrainian parliament objected to more than twenty of<br>
its provisions -- on citizenship, state languages, and state symbols -- and<br>
ordered Crimea to align those provisions with Ukrainian law. Deputy Speaker<br>
of the Crimean parliament Vladimir Klychnikov said compromises have now been<br>
reached on almost all the disputed points. For example, the article on<br>
citizenship now stipulates that "citizens of Ukraine who permanently reside<br>
in Crimea shall be citizens of Crimea." The words "republic symbols" will<br>
replace the term "state symbols," which was unacceptable to the Ukrainian<br>
authorities. Klychnikov said he hopes the amended constitution will be<br>
adopted by the Crimean parliament within two to three weeks. (Itar-Tass,<br>
November 16) If so, this should resolve a dispute between Ukraine and its<br>
predominantly Russian-populated autonomous republic that has at times<br>
seriously threatened to disrupt relations between Kiev and Moscow.<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
GEORGIAN-ABKHAZ DIRECT CONTACTS DISCLOSED. Senior Georgian officials and<br>
Abkhaz representatives disclosed yesterday that a delegation headed by<br>
Abkhazia's unrecognized foreign minister, Konstantin Ozgan, conferred with<br>
Georgian president Eduard Shevardnadze and other officials last week in<br>
Tbilisi. Both sides agreed to continue high-level contacts. Georgian foreign<br>
minister Irakly Menagarishvili, a participant in the discussions, stated<br>
yesterday that a possible meeting between Shevardnadze and Abkhaz leader<br>
Vladislav Ardzinba was discussed. Menagarishvili made clear that such a<br>
meeting is a long shot at the moment, and that a political settlement<br>
remains "impossible on the terms on which the Abkhaz side insists today."<br>
But he expressed hope that direct contacts with the Abkhaz side "in talks<br>
parallel to the negotiating process" may help moderate the Abkhaz position.<br>
(Interfax, November 18)<br>
<p>
This last remark apparently reveals Tbilisi's objective of establishing a<br>
bilateral negotiating channel, which would initially parallel and later<br>
perhaps substitute for the "official" tripartite Russian-Georgian-Abkhaz<br>
format that is controlled by Moscow. As regards Ozgan, there is a perception<br>
in Tbilisi that he is a political rival of Ardzinba. The Abkhaz delegates at<br>
the Tbilisi talks evidenced awareness of the need to show some movement<br>
toward a settlement of the conflict in order to ease the economic isolation<br>
of the unrecognized republic.<br>
<p>
MOSCOW "GUARANTEES" SAFE TRANSIT OF AZERBAIJANI OIL. Azerbaijani<br>
presidential aides yesterday cited Boris Berezovsky, deputy secretary of<br>
Russia's Security Council, as having assured Azerbaijani president Haidar<br>
Aliev that Russia and the new Chechen government can guarantee the safe<br>
transport of "early" Azerbaijani oil to Russia via Chechnya. Berezovsky told<br>
Aliev in Baku last week that Grozny is both interested in and capable of<br>
providing security of the Chechen stretch of the Baku-Novorossiisk pipeline.<br>
Concerns expressed by Azerbaijan and the Western consortium over pipeline<br>
security are "unwarranted," Berezovsky was cited as assuring Aliev. Also<br>
yesterday, Russia's first deputy minister for oil and power, Anatoly<br>
Shatalov, offered similar assurances in Moscow for the benefit of Western<br>
investors. Shatalov added that the Chechnya stretch of the pipeline requires<br>
only "insignificant repairs" and will be ready to transport Azerbaijani oil<br>
next year. (Petroleum Information Agency, Interfax, November 18)<br>
<p>
Russian and western sources recently reported that the pipeline's Chechnya<br>
stretch is shot through with holes made during the recent war in order to<br>
pilfer from the meager amounts of oil still in transit. An increase in the<br>
amount transported would correspondingly increase the security risks. The<br>
repair costs today must exceed by far the official Russian pre-war estimate<br>
of $55 million, which was itself probably an underestimation. The "early"<br>
oil, which was expected to be on stream from Azerbaijan's Chirag oil field<br>
in 1996 but is now due for August 1997, amounts to 32 million tons over  a<br>
7-year period. The amount is relatively insignificant, but Moscow wants to<br>
route it through Russia in order to establish a title to transiting the much<br>
larger amounts of "future oil" from Azerbaijan to the Russian port of<br>
Novorossiisk.<br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
TAJIK GOVERNMENT PLANS CRUCIAL MILITARY OPERATION BEFORE WINTER. Lt. Gen.<br>
Viktor Zavarzin, commander of Russian "peacekeeping" troops in Tajikistan,<br>
yesterday denied charges that his troops are assisting Tajik government<br>
forces in preparing a counteroffensive in central Tajikistan. He depicted<br>
such charges as "bare-faced, brazen, impudent, and monstrous lies which<br>
could only arise in the inflamed brains of Russia's enemies." The troops are<br>
"fully neutral" because their CIS mandate requires them to be, the general<br>
added. Zavarzin was responding to Tajik opposition appeals to the UN, asking<br>
it to stop the Russian command from providing logistical support to Tajik<br>
government forces gathering for a counteroffensive in Tavildara and<br>
Karategin. Confirming those preparations, Zavarzin expressed confidence that<br>
government troops are capable without assistance of regaining the ground<br>
they recently lost in central Tajikistan. (Itar-Tass, November 18)<br>
<p>
Dushanbe officials belatedly acknowledged yesterday that opposition field<br>
commander Mullo Abdullo's fighters captured Komsomolabad last week and<br>
ousted the Dushanbe-appointed authorities without firing a shot. The<br>
government is now rushing troops and armor to that area and also to the<br>
critical Haburoabad Pass, near which the opposition fighters hold the<br>
dominant heights. Last week, the governor of the eastern region of<br>
Badakhshan abandoned his office in the face of anti-government<br>
demonstrations in the regional capital Horog. (Interfax, November 18; NTV,<br>
November 17) Unless government forces regain their lost positions in central<br>
Tajikistan quickly, the onset of winter weather will enable the opposition<br>
to consolidate its military gains and put an end to Dushanbe's political<br>
authority in the central and eastern parts of the country.<br>

November 18, 1996 <br>
 <br>
To Our Readers <br>
<i>&gt;From Bill Geimer </i><br>
	President, The Jamestown Foundation <br>
 <br>
We regret to inform you that we will be unable to continue  providing our <br>
publications to you free of charge. <br>
 <br>
For the last eighteen months, it has been our privilege to distribute <br>
Jamestown's daily Monitor, the Fortnight In Review, and Prism to thousands <br>
of readers throughout the world.  We have been gratified to learn from your <br>
comments that so many of you believe that these publications are without <br>
equal.  We agree and, moreover, are determined to make them even better in <br>
the months and years ahead.  But we cannot do this without help from you. <br>
 <br>
The Jamestown Foundation is a not-for-profit educational organization whose <br>
mission is to provide information and analysis on developments in the former <br>
Soviet Union to the widest possible audience.  The way to reach the widest <br>
possible audience is of course to distribute the publications at no cost to our <br>
readers, and we would dearly love to continue doing this.  Unfortunately, we <br>
can't. <br>
 <br>
The Monitor, Fortnight In Review, and Prism have been made possible by the <br>
generosity of a handful of private donors.  They have contributed resources to <br>
the program because they believe, as do we, that it is crucial that <br>
governments, and the policy and business communities, achieve a realistic <br>
understanding of the enormous changes which have been taking place in the <br>
FSU, and which affect the peace and security of our planet. <br>
 <br>
However the generosity of these wonderful people is necessarily finite, and <br>
the time has come for our readers to share the burden of sustaining and <br>
expanding these valuable periodicals. <br>
 <br>
As we convert our publications to a paid-subscription basis, we will look <br>
primarily to the business community for revenue.  Businesses will be <br>
expected to pay on an annual basis what consultants tell us is market value:  <br>
the daily Monitor ($1,495), the Fortnight In Review ($715), Prism ($595). <br>
 <br>
But, consistent with our educational public purpose, we will provide these <br>
publications to individuals in the academic world, and in other not-for-profit <br>
organizations, at greatly reduced rates.   <br>
 <br>
For a single annual subscription fee of $100 we will send you all three of our <br>
publications, the Monitor, the Fortnight, and Prism.  Each year we publish <br>
over 250 issues of the Monitor,  26 Fortnights, and 12 issues of Prism.  We <br>
think you'll agree that this price is, to put it mildly, a bargain. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;From students, we are asking a nominal annual fee of $10 for all three </i><br>
publications. <br>
 <br>
If you would like to continue to receive Jamestown's publications, please print <br>
out the form below and send it along with your payment by postal mail.  Your <br>
subscription will begin as soon as we receive your payment.  If we do not <br>
receive your order before November 29, we will remove you from our <br>
distribution list. <br>
 <br>
Again, we regret very much the need to make this change.  We hope that you <br>
understand.  <br>
 <br>
Sincerely, <br>
 <br>
William W. Geimer <br>

<p>
MOLDOVAN PRESIDENT FORCED INTO RUNOFF. Incumbent president Mircea Snegur<br>
will face parliament chairman Petru Lucinschi in the December 1 runoff of<br>
Moldova's presidential election, officials told the Monitor. In yesterday's<br>
first round, nearly complete returns show Snegur with 39 percent of the<br>
vote, Lucinschi with 28 percent, Communist candidate Vladimir Voronin with<br>
10 percent, Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli and pro-Romanian candidate<br>
Valeriu Matei with 9 percent each, and several minor candidates with smaller<br>
percentages. Lucinschi looks better placed than Snegur to win over most of<br>
the supporters of the candidates defeated in the first round. (Telephone<br>
conversation with the Monitor corespondent, November 18)<br>
<p>
RYBKIN RIPPED FOR NATO REMARKS. Vladimir Lukin, the influential chairman of<br>
the Russian Duma's International Affairs Committee, has criticized Security<br>
Council secretary Ivan Rybkin's recent call for Russia to seek entry into<br>
NATO. Lukin described the proposal as Rybkin's "personal opinion" and<br>
suggested that its public airing could complicate the Foreign Ministry's<br>
efforts to halt the enlargement process. Lukin, who reiterated Moscow's<br>
opposition to NATO expansion, said that the Security Council secretary has<br>
no constitutional right to speak out on such matters. (Interfax, November 15)<br>
<p>
NO AGREEMENT ON RUSSIAN MILITARY BUDGET. The conciliatory commission trying<br>
to hammer out Russia's 1997 budget failed to agree on military allocations<br>
last week. It decided to wait until the government submits its defense<br>
procurement orders for the next year before meeting again. The government<br>
proposed 102.8 trillion rubles for the Defense Ministry and the military<br>
programs of the Atomic Energy Ministry, a sum the ministries and some Duma<br>
members felt was inadequate. (Itar-Tass, November 14)<br>
<p>
DUMA WORRIED ABOUT RUSSIAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS. The Russian Duma on Friday<br>
passed a resolution "On the critical situation pertaining to the financing<br>
of work on creating, improving and using nuclear weapons." It called for<br>
greater funding in this area, especially for the federal nuclear centers.<br>
The legislators expressed concern that scheduled servicing of nuclear<br>
weapons had virtually ceased, which, it said, "will lead to a decrease in<br>
their reliability and their safety for use..." (Itar-Tass, November 15) <br>
<p>
IRAN BUYS ANOTHER RUSSIAN SUBMARINE. Iran expects to take delivery of its<br>
third Russian-built Kilo-class submarine later this month, an Iranian<br>
spokesman announced on November 16. The deal was delayed for over a year as<br>
Iran negotiated for a barter arrangement, but Moscow successfully held out<br>
for cash. Iran's growing naval strength has worried Western and regional<br>
leaders, who are likely to criticize this latest sale. Iran took delivery on<br>
the first two Russian subs in 1992-1993. (Xinhua, November 16)<br>
<p>
UKRAINE WINS CREDIT FROM WORLD BANK. The World Bank has granted Ukraine a<br>
$300 million credit for the restructuring of its agricultural sector. The<br>
credit will be disbursed in two equal tranches, with the first expected to<br>
be awarded before the end of the year. The credit will be used for seed<br>
production, registration of property rights, and export guarantees.<br>
(Interfax, 15 November)<br>

<p>
RESCUERS SEARCH FOR SURVIVORS OF DAGESTAN BLAST. A powerful blast destroyed<br>
an apartment building in the Dagestani city of Kaspiisk in the early morning<br>
hours on November 16. The building housed troops from the Caucasus border<br>
guards detachment, including almost all of its commanding officers. Some 130<br>
people, including 80 border guards and their families, were buried in the<br>
rubble. Rescue work is still going on. As of this morning, the death toll<br>
had reached 43, including 15 children, but officials said the final number<br>
of casualties could reach over 50. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin flew<br>
to the scene and a government commission headed by Deputy Premier Oleg Lobov<br>
has been formed. (NTV, ORT, November 16-17; Reuter, November 18)<br>
<p>
Federal investigators believe that the explosion was the work of terrorists.<br>
They have hypothesized that the bombing may have been carried out by<br>
maverick Chechen resistance fighters who do not take orders from Chechen<br>
premier Aslan Maskhadov and who want to derail the peace process. Chechen<br>
president Zelimkhan Yandarbiev denied that Chechen fighters were<br>
responsible, but concurred that the blast was the work of people "who have<br>
no interest in peace coming to Chechnya." Another hypothesis is that the<br>
bombing was the work of organized crime. The Caucasus border guards, who<br>
were its target, patrol Dagestan's border not only with Chechnya but also<br>
with Azerbaijan. According to this version, the mafia groups were taking<br>
revenge on the border guards for blocking the smuggling of narcotics and<br>
arms into Russia from Azerbaijan. (NTV, November 17)<br>
<p>
About a month ago the chairman of Dagestan's parliament, Mukhu Aliev, told<br>
the Monitor that the signing of the Khasavyurt accords had sharply<br>
destabilized the situation in Dagestan. In Aliev's opinion, there are two<br>
major threats to Dagestan. The first is posed by rogue Chechen resistance<br>
fighters who, after prevailing at home, wish to continue the battle<br>
throughout the North Caucasus. The second involves local mafia who,<br>
according to Aliev, have already penetrated the government and are now<br>
preparing to seize power. Aliev also did not rule out the possibility that<br>
circles in Moscow opposed to the Chechen peace agreements might also be<br>
trying to destabilize the situation in Dagestan. In the last few years some<br>
24 terrorist acts have been committed against Dagestani politicians, ten of<br>
which resulted in death. None of these crimes has been solved.<br>
<p>
U.S. RELEASES FORMER RUSSIAN SPY. Vladimir Galkin, a former mid-level Soviet<br>
KGB agent, returned home a hero on November 17 following a U.S. Justice<br>
Department decision to drop espionage charges against him. The November 14<br>
court decision brought to a close a spy wrangle that had begun with Galkin's<br>
arrest by the FBI on October 29 and that escalated into a major<br>
confrontation between the U.S. and Russian intelligence communities. Moscow<br>
had described the arrest of the former intelligence officer as a dirty<br>
trick, and had repeatedly warned that it would retaliate in kind -- probably<br>
against retired U.S. intelligence personnel working in Russia. (See Monitor,<br>
November 6, 11) Indeed, the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB),<br>
Russia's domestic counter-intelligence agency, told reporters on November 15<br>
that the FSB had prepared a "retaliation target list" for use in the event<br>
that Galkin was not released. <br>
<p>
In the end, the convergence of developments on several fronts appeared to<br>
force the embarrassing retreat by U.S. authorities. The CIA, which according<br>
to a Justice Department statement had not originally opposed the plans to<br>
arrest Galkin, apparently took heed of the threats from Moscow and advised<br>
Galkin's release. The State Department concurred. Finally, an 11th hour<br>
appeal from Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to U.S. vice president Al<br>
Gore appeared also to have played a role in the decision. <br>
<p>
In Moscow, representatives of the intelligence community welcomed the U.S.<br>
action, and said that it had averted a major diplomatic fall-out between<br>
Moscow and Washington. The same officials also made clear, however, that<br>
they remained angry over the incident. They suggested that strained<br>
relations between the intelligence communities of the two countries might<br>
linger, and intimated that joint actions in such areas as the fight against<br>
organized crime could be adversely affected. (Russian and U.S. agencies,<br>
November 14-17)<br>
<p>
DOUBTS OVER AUTHENTICITY OF KREMLINGATE TAPE. Doubts are being expressed<br>
over the authenticity of a transcript published on November 15 in Moscow's<br>
largest circulation newspaper, Moskovsky komsomolets. The transcripted<br>
conversation purportedly took place on June 22 -- between the two rounds of<br>
Russia's presidential election -- and involved the chief of Yeltsin's<br>
election campaign, Anatoly Chubais, and other top presidential aides<br>
discussing covert funding for the campaign. Chubais has vehemently denied<br>
that the conversation ever took place, and Aleksandr Korzhakov, the former<br>
Yeltsin aide initially suspected of leaking the transcript, has also denied<br>
having anything to do with it. (ORT, November 15) Moskovsky komsomolets,<br>
which in its November 15 issue said it had no doubt as to the document's<br>
authenticity, backtracked in an editorial the following day in which it<br>
merely claimed that the document was " more or less plausible." Political<br>
commentators are speculating that Yeltsin's apparently rapid recovery from<br>
heart surgery has forced Moscow leaders to come to terms with the<br>
possibility that he will be around for another four years. They are<br>
therefore readjusting their sights. Instead of attacking one another in an<br>
effort to gain the lead in the Kremlin succession stakes, they are aiming to<br>
get Yeltsin's ear. This places Chubais, Yeltsin's closest aide, in the<br>
firing range. (NTV, November 17) <br>
<p>
RYBKIN MEETS WITH CHECHEN ENVOY. Security Council secretary Ivan Rybkin met<br>
on November 16 with Akhmed Zakaev, an aide to Chechen president Zelimkhan<br>
Yandarbiev, to prepare for the signing of an agreement by the Russian and<br>
Chechen prime ministers. "We have no disagreements in principle on any of<br>
the issues we have defined, and we have prepared a good, solid document<br>
which will bring results in the near future," Zakaev said afterwards. In<br>
Zakaev's opinion, this document will serve as the legal basis for relations<br>
between Moscow and Chechnya until presidential and parliamentary elections<br>
are held in the republic on January 27. As stipulated in the agreement,<br>
Russian and Chechen legislation will coexist on Chechen territory until that<br>
date. According to Rybkin, the time and place of the agreement's signing<br>
were not discussed at the meeting. (RTR, November 16)<br>
<p>
On the eve of the November 16 meeting Chechen resistance leaders had<br>
stressed that they would sign only economic, but not political agreements.<br>
(See Monitor, November 15) Since both sides emerged satisfied from the<br>
meeting, it can be surmised that Rybkin must have made some concessions to<br>
Grozny. The decree signed November 16 by Doku Zavgaev, head of Chechnya's<br>
pro-Moscow government, disbanding his cabinet of ministers, is an indirect<br>
confirmation of this. (RTR, November 16) Zavgaev, who is completely<br>
dependent on the Russian leadership, must have taken this step under Russian<br>
pressure.<br>
<p>
SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME TO RUSSIAN-JAPANESE TALKS. In a sign that<br>
Japanese-Russian relations may be developing some forward momentum, Japanese<br>
foreign minister Yukihiko Ikeda announced on November 17 that Tokyo would<br>
resume disbursing some $500 million in Export-Import Bank loans to Russia.<br>
The aid package had been frozen since 1991. Ikeda's announcement followed<br>
what was described as an intense round of talks in Tokyo between Ikeda and<br>
his Russian counterpart, Yevgeny Primakov. The loans, originally intended<br>
only for "humanitarian assistance," would now be made available for<br>
commercial and industrial projects, Japanese officials said. According to<br>
Japanese media, potential projects include a car plant outside of Moscow and<br>
industrial water works in the Far Eastern city of Nakhodka. <br>
<p>
The two sides appeared also to have made some progress in talks on the Kuril<br>
Islands territorial dispute. As expected, Primakov proposed that the two<br>
countries jointly develop the four islands, which have been held by Russia<br>
since the end of World War II but which are claimed by Japan. Ikeda said<br>
that Tokyo would study the Russian proposals, and Russian sources quoted a<br>
highly placed Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying that joint<br>
economic projects on the islands might serve as a step toward improving<br>
broader bilateral relations. Previously Tokyo had been reticent to commit to<br>
such projects, fearing that its assent in this area could be interpreted as<br>
recognition of Russian sovereignty over the islands. Indeed, both sides<br>
approached the proposed joint economic projects warily and placed them in<br>
differing political contexts. Primakov emphasized that the proposals do not<br>
constitute a renunciation by Russia of its ownership of the islands, while<br>
Japanese officials intimated that they would view the projects as a stepping<br>
stone toward recognition of Japan's claims on the islands. (Reuter,<br>
Itar-Tass, November 16)<br>
<p>
ANOTHER SETBACK FOR RUSSIAN SPACE PROGRAM. Russia's troubled space program<br>
suffered a serious setback on November 17 when its "Mars-96" interplanetary<br>
space probe failed to attain sufficient speed to break out of earth orbit<br>
for a planned mission to Mars. Again, the problem was with a booster<br>
rocket--this time the fourth stage of the Proton-K launch vehicle, which<br>
apparently failed to ignite. Many European nations and the U.S. were<br>
involved in the Mars-96 project. A Russian space official said the probe<br>
would probably remain in orbit for no more than 30 days before<br>
disintegrating as it falls back into the earth's atmosphere.<br>
(Interfax-Ukraine, November 17)<br>
<p>
The Proton is Russia's largest operational space booster and has had an<br>
enviable success since the first version was fired in 1965. The November 17<br>
attempt was the 246th launch of a Proton. Seven of the 8 other launches this<br>
year using the Proton were successful, including the first Russian launch of<br>
an American commercial satellite. All of these launches, however, involved<br>
the 3-stage version of the Proton-K. Khrunichev, manufacturer of the Proton,<br>
and the American aerospace firm Lockheed Martin have formed a joint venture<br>
to market the Proton for international commercial launches. <br>
<p>
Russia has been in friendly but serious competition with the U.S. to explore<br>
Mars. The Americans launched a probe for Mars two weeks ago and will send<br>
another probe on the way early in December. With only a two-month launch<br>
window every two years, the Russians are sure to fall behind. <br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
HAS LUKASHENKO BEGUN HIS COUP? Belarus president Aleksandr Lukashenko has<br>
"dismissed" Central Election Commission chairman Viktar Ganchar from his<br>
post and appointed another chairman by presidential decree. Lukashenko told<br>
the country in a broadcast on November 14 that he was dismissing Ganchar for<br>
the latter's "destabilizing" refusal to recognize as lawful the<br>
constitutional referendum ordered by Lukashenko and also because of<br>
Ganchar's attempt to rebut Lukashenko's speech to the Russian Duma last<br>
week. The Constitutional Court promptly warned Lukashenko that his measure<br>
is unlawful, since the parliament alone is empowered to appoint the CEC's<br>
chairman and supervise its activities. Ganchar vowed to stay at his post,<br>
but on November 15 security troops forcibly evicted him and members of his<br>
staff. They also blocked parliamentary deputies, including Speaker Syamyon<br>
Sharetsky, from escorting Ganchar back into the CEC offices. In addition,<br>
OMON and presidential security guards blocked some deputies of the<br>
parliamentary majority from entering the parliament building that day.<br>
<p>
On November 15 Sharetsky and the parliament's presidium urged governments<br>
and legislatures around the world to support democracy in Belarus against<br>
the attempt to "install a dictatorship under the guise of a referendum."<br>
They also called for a special CIS summit to discuss the situation.<br>
Meanwhile, security forces yesterday again dispersed a 4,000-strong<br>
demonstration in support of democracy and state independence. Some senior<br>
parliamentarians who marched in the demonstration received blows from OMON<br>
batons.<br>
<p>
In what looks like symptoms of disaffection in the president's ranks, Prime<br>
Minister Mikhail Chigir cited "the President's policy of confrontation with<br>
the parliament" in announcing his resignation. In addition, Lukashenko<br>
dismissed deputy minister of internal affairs Mikalay Krechka from his post,<br>
while Foreign Minister Andrey Sannikau resigned, reportedly over his<br>
disagreement with Lukashenko's plan to condition the removal of the last<br>
ex-Soviet strategic nuclear arms from Belarus on NATO's renunciation of its<br>
enlargement plans. (Belaplan, Radio Minsk, NTV, Western agencies, November<br>
15-17; Itar-Tass, November 18)<br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
PATRIARCH ALEKSY NOTES EQUAL STATUS OF RUSSIAN ORTHODOXY. The Patriarch of<br>
Moscow and All Russia, Aleksy II, has completed a week-long visit to<br>
Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan in connection with the 125th anniversary of the<br>
founding of the Russian Orthodox Church's archbishopric for Central Asia.<br>
The head of the Russian Orthodox Church met with Presidents Islam Karimov<br>
and Askar Akayev, with senior Muslim clergymen in those countries, and with<br>
local Russian Orthodox clergy and believers. Aleksy also conducted services<br>
in recently restored Russian Orthodox cathedrals in Tashkent and Bishkek and<br>
visited newly built churches in the two countries. Aleksy expressed approval<br>
of state policies toward the Russian Orthodox Church, the "equal treatment"<br>
accorded its believers, and the "interethnic consensus and mutual respect<br>
among religious denominations" he claimed to have observed in those countries.<br>
<p>
On the same anniversary, Aleksy awarded the Dmitry Donskoy order to<br>
Kazakhstani president Nursultan Nazarbayev for supporting the restitution of<br>
church buildings in Kazakhstan to the Russian Orthodox diocese. Statements<br>
issued on the same occasion by Nazarbayev, Karimov, and Akayev described the<br>
coexistence of Muslim and Christian faiths in the region as an illustration<br>
of religious tolerance and a factor of stability in interethnic relations.<br>
The presidents said that Russian Orthodoxy has become a constitutive element<br>
in the social life of these countries. (Itar-Tass, Interfax, November 9-15)<br>
The Central Asian leaders are interested in promoting religious pluralism as<br>
part of their strategy of containing Islamic radicalism. <br>
<p>
Aleksy's visit, his first to Central Asia, may have helped relieve his<br>
preexisting concerns about the situation of the Russian Orthodox Church<br>
there. "I will convey our concern to our compatriots, who ended up outside<br>
Russia and sometimes face a hostile environment. Many of them have a hard<br>
life in the newly sovereign states," he had said in a sermon as he was<br>
embarking on his visit. (Itar-Tass, November 8) Aleksy's recognition of the<br>
freedom and official protection enjoyed by Russian Orthodoxy in those<br>
countries may help defuse allegations to the contrary from nationalist<br>
circles in Moscow. <br>

THE FORTNIGHT IN REVIEW<br>
<p>
	Russian president Boris Yeltsin's heart surgery had little immediate impact<br>
on the well-publicized intriguing that has dominated Kremlin politics and<br>
disrupted the government's decision making. Not surprisingly, this political<br>
infighting continued over the past fortnight to hamstring efforts by the<br>
Federal government to assert authority over Russia's often clamorous<br>
regions. In the area of foreign policy, a muted reaction to the results of<br>
the U.S. presidential election was pushed into the background by a bizarre<br>
spy wrangle between Washington and Moscow. Russia was more active in the<br>
"near abroad," where Moscow made a bid to secure the long-term presence of<br>
its Black Sea Fleet in Crimea, and to restore a degree of control over<br>
offshore mineral resources in the Caspian Sea. Moscow's gambits in these<br>
areas were part of a broader attempt at halting or even reversing certain<br>
processes underway since the dissolution of the USSR.<br>
<p>
PRESIDENT FOR A DAY <br>
	Viktor Chernomyrdin became president of Russia for a day on November 6,<br>
when Boris Yeltsin underwent long-awaited heart surgery and delegated his<br>
presidential powers to the prime minister. Less than 24 hours later, Yeltsin<br>
took those powers back. The president seemed keen to impress the world that<br>
he had resumed control after four months as a lame duck. Doctors said<br>
Yeltsin's recovery was going well and that the president should be back to<br>
work early in the new year. Parliamentary leader Aleksandr Shokhin quipped<br>
that the real reason for Yeltsin's hasty resumption of powers was that his<br>
aide, Anatoly Chubais, did not want to spend a minute longer than necessary<br>
playing the part of Chernomyrdin's deputy.<br>
	The Russian media, meanwhile, questioned for the first time the political<br>
role of Yeltsin's daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko. In a commentary reminiscent<br>
of the debate provoked some years ago by U.S. First Lady Hillary Clinton,<br>
the journalist Tatyana Koshkareva wrote in Nezavisimaya gazeta on November<br>
10 that family members, of course, cannot be prevented from exerting an<br>
influence over state leaders. But can anything be done, she wondered, to<br>
make such people publicly accountable? "Which is worse," Koshkareva asked:<br>
"To admit that Yeltsin's daughter has played a part in state affairs, or to<br>
continue to shroud Dyachenko's Kremlin role in a veil of mystery?"<br>
	For its part, the Duma was more than open about its concern over the role<br>
of Chief-of-Staff Chubais. Russia's constitution mentions the presidential<br>
administration but is vague about its powers and responsibilities. Now the<br>
Communist-dominated Duma has asked the Constitutional Court to rule on<br>
whether Chubais has usurped powers that the constitution formally vests in<br>
other branches of government. Chubais is indeed a powerful figure on the<br>
Kremlin scene. He has combined posts that were, in Yeltsin's first<br>
administration, exercised by three separate officials. These are the post of<br>
former chief-of-staff Sergei Filatov and the gatekeeping functions of former<br>
aide Viktor Ilyushin and bodyguard Aleksandr Korzhakov. Yeltsin, normally a<br>
master of the art of divide and rule, has allowed this to happen. Some<br>
commentators believe Yeltsin trusts Chubais because Dyachenko does so.<br>
<p>
WEAK STATE, STRONG REGIONS <br>
	Although Chubais' powers are vast, they are wielded in an environment in<br>
which the Kremlin's writ often runs little further than the Moscow<br>
ring-road. "Many Russian regions have turned into little feudal kingdoms,"<br>
Obshchaya gazeta commented this month. Chubais has indicated that the<br>
weakness of the state is his main concern, and that he is determined to<br>
correct this situation by tightening Moscow's control over the regions. The<br>
only lever he has at his disposal is financial. A large (and growing)<br>
majority of Russian regions depend on the federal center for financial<br>
support, and almost all of them are in arrears with their contributions to<br>
the federal budget. This (as well as pressure from the IMF) is why Chubais<br>
established the Extraordinary Commission on Taxation. It gives him a means<br>
of reasserting federal authority over the regions by reminding them that<br>
they do not -- as many had begun to think -- exercise unfettered control<br>
over the valuable resources on their territories.<br>
	But Chubais has a competitor in his struggle for control over the regions<br>
-- Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov. Luzhkov is building a network of contacts<br>
between the Moscow municipality and regions ranging from Arkhangelsk and St.<br>
Petersburg to Saratov and Kaliningrad. Luzhkov also leads an unofficial<br>
coalition of donor-regions, that is, regions which make net contributions to<br>
the federal budget. (Every fourth tax ruble is contributed by Moscow,<br>
Luzhkov likes to point out.) Luzhkov's network promotes the interests of the<br>
big Moscow-based banks and financial institutions and develops contacts that<br>
will come in useful if the Moscow mayor decides to make a bid for the<br>
presidency.<br>
<p>
CHECHNYA -- THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY? <br>
	In recent days, Luzhkov has also formed an alliance with the breakaway<br>
republic of Chechnya, taking its war-torn capital of Grozny under Moscow's<br>
patronage and promising various forms of aid. But, although Chechnya is<br>
behaving like an independent state, its leaders continue to express a strong<br>
interest in maintaining economic ties to Russia. With such considerations in<br>
mind, the parliamentarian Sergei Shakhrai has come up with a plan for<br>
establishing a free economic zone throughout Chechnya. Shakhrai hopes that<br>
the plan will satisfy the republic's demand for independence while, at the<br>
same time, creating sufficient financial inducements to persuade Chechnya to<br>
remain within Russia when, in five years time, the question of its status<br>
returns to the agenda. Shakhrai's draft is currently being debated by both<br>
government and parliament.<br>
<p>
KEEPING PEACE IN THE ARMED FORCES <br>
	Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia's president has carefully<br>
cultivated key segments of the uniformed military. With one eye on the<br>
presidency himself, Viktor Chernomyrdin has in recent months continued that<br>
policy in his role as stand-in for the ailing president. But Chernomyrdin's<br>
semi-stewardship of the Kremlin's relations with the military leadership --<br>
he has also been chairing meetings of Russia's Defense Council -- has come<br>
at a time when wage and payment arrears have combined with a host of other<br>
long-festering problems to create a near crisis situation among armed forces<br>
personnel.<br>
	Such concerns prompted Chernomyrdin to meet in Ryazan on November 1 with<br>
disgruntled soldiers and cadets from the local Airborne Forces garrison.<br>
There, Chernomyrdin conveyed the government's concern over the soldiers'<br>
plight, and pledged to clear up the wage and payment arrears. That<br>
performance was reprised on November 12, when Chernomyrdin presided over a<br>
White House meeting of Russia's political and military leaderships. Although<br>
the proceedings were reported to have ended on a positive note, it was<br>
unclear afterward whether the government would be able to guarantee the<br>
funding that the Defense Ministry appears implicitly to have requested in<br>
exchange for its commitment to cut Russia's military machine. Moreover,<br>
assurances from Chernomyrdin to the Top Brass that similar reductions would<br>
be imposed upon Russia's other "power structures" seemed likely to provoke<br>
intense opposition within the Kremlin among the powerful leaders of those<br>
agencies.<br>
<p>
POST-ELECTION RELATIONS: MORE OF THE SAME? <br>
	In general, Russia's political elite reacted with relief to incumbent<br>
president Bill Clinton's reelection victory on November 5, but few in Moscow<br>
evidenced any conviction that recent U.S. political developments presaged a<br>
new honeymoon in relations between the two countries. Some Russian observers<br>
pointed to the U.S. Republican party's continued control of Congress as a<br>
particular reason for pessimism, and there were accusations that the U.S.<br>
election results could even propel Washington to adopt a much harder line<br>
toward Russia. But, with a number of potentially divisive issues on the<br>
horizon -- including NATO enlargement and ratification of the START II<br>
Treaty -- most observers foresaw the future of bilateral relations as, at<br>
best, a mixed bag in which the two sides would continue as before to lurch<br>
between confrontation and cooperation.<br>
	Indeed, one week before the election a seemingly innocuous incident<br>
occurred that threatened to turn into a genuine diplomatic donnybrook. On<br>
October 29 the FBI arrested a former Soviet intelligence officer as he<br>
arrived at JFK airport in New York. U.S. authorities accused Aleksandr<br>
Galkin of having attempted in 1991 to procure classified documents on the<br>
Strategic Defense Initiative. The arrest incensed Russia's intelligence<br>
community, which called it a "dirty trick" and a contravention of an<br>
unspoken agreement between the two countries not to arrest former<br>
intelligence personnel. As the days passed representatives of Russia's<br>
Foreign Security Service stepped up their threats to retaliate if Galkin<br>
were not released. A full crisis was averted only at the 11th hour, when<br>
U.S. authorities agreed on November 14 to drop the charges against Galkin.<br>
<p>
MIXED SIGNALS ON NATO ENLARGEMENT <br>
	Russian policy on an issue of central importance to its entire political<br>
elite -- NATO enlargement -- took an unlikely turn on October 30 as Russia's<br>
recently appointed Security Council secretary, Ivan Rybkin, called publicly<br>
for Russia to be admitted into NATO's political structures. That remark and<br>
several other developments led several Russian dailies on November 1 to the<br>
conclusion that the Security Council would soon play a more prominent role<br>
in Russia's dealings with NATO. On the same day, moreover, it was also<br>
reported that Rybkin's remarks had reflected the well-considered position of<br>
unnamed individuals within the president's administration.<br>
	Rybkin's initiative directly contradicted Moscow's long-standing, official<br>
policy toward the Western alliance, however, and on November 5 Russian<br>
foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov effectively told Rybkin to leave diplomacy<br>
and NATO policy to the Foreign Ministry. But the rebuff was ignored, and on<br>
November 12 Rybkin again proposed that Russia join NATO, and this time added<br>
that Moscow might also look forward eventually to entering the alliance's<br>
military wing. The mixed signals coming out of Moscow appeared to leave NATO<br>
leaders perplexed, and also raised the prospect of a conflict on the issue<br>
between Russia's Security Council and its Foreign Ministry.<br>
<p>
THE BLACK SEA: RUSSIA OVERPLAYS ITS HAND <br>
	Moscow may have missed an opportunity for an advantageous settlement of its<br>
dispute with Ukraine over the ex-Soviet Black Sea Fleet and naval bases in<br>
Crimea. Barely two weeks earlier, Moscow had appeared poised for a<br>
breakthrough -- thanks to its insistence that resolution of the dispute must<br>
precede the signing of an interstate political treaty with Ukraine and<br>
Russian recognition of Ukraine's borders. Ukrainian leaders, already<br>
subjected to Russian leverage on trade and energy issues, and concerned that<br>
any of the likely successors to President Boris Yeltsin might prove even<br>
more difficult to deal with, appeared to lose their nerve. Ukrainian<br>
president Leonid Kuchma's October 24 meetings in Moscow with Yeltsin and<br>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin appeared to set the stage for a quick<br>
signing of the package of agreements on the fleet and its bases.<br>
	Yet the follow-up rounds of talks, held on October 31 and November 6 and<br>
expected to be the last, ended in renewed disagreement. Ukrainian leaders<br>
seemed to regain their bearings as Yeltsin's seemingly restored health<br>
lessened at least this source of pressure on Kiev to make concessions for a<br>
quick agreement. More importantly perhaps, hardening Russian demands,<br>
believed to have originated with Chernomyrdin, ultimately helped stiffen<br>
Kiev's spine. Officials pointed out that Ukraine had "reached the limit of<br>
concessions" after having earlier accepted a lopsided partition of the fleet<br>
in Russia's favor and its long-term basing in Ukraine, rather than either<br>
declaring the fleet Ukrainian property or setting a timetable for its<br>
withdrawal from Ukrainian territory.<br>
	The follow-up talks were "marked by tensions and a heavy atmosphere,"<br>
according to top Ukrainian officials. Russia's chief delegates, Deputy Prime<br>
Minister Valery Serov and navy commander-in-chief Adm. Feliks Gromov,<br>
presented demands aiming to maximize Russia's presence and rights in<br>
Sevastopol while minimizing those of Ukraine. The Russian side opposed the<br>
siting of Ukraine's naval command in Sevastopol, claiming this right<br>
exclusively for the Russian command. It sought to restrict Ukrainian ships<br>
to anchorages in only one bay and demanded that the coastal infrastructure<br>
in Sevastopol, as well as other bases, be transferred to Russian ownership<br>
rather than being leased to the Russian fleet. The Russian side also<br>
insisted on retaining ground-based forces attached to the fleet in excess of<br>
the ceilings set by the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty.<br>
	The Ukrainian side, led by Deputy Prime Minister Vasyl Durdinets and First<br>
Deputy Defense Minister Col. Gen. Ivan Bizhan, asserted that the siting of<br>
Ukraine's naval command in Sevastopol and Ukrainian ownership of the coastal<br>
infrastructure to be leased to Russia are non-negotiable prerogatives of<br>
Ukrainian state sovereignty. The Ukrainian side called for the removal of<br>
the Russian ground-based forces that exceed CFE limits. And, in keeping with<br>
those CFE norms, it insisted that the agreement on the status of the Russian<br>
fleet and naval bases in Ukraine must stipulate upper limits to the forces<br>
allowed to be stationed in Ukraine as well as define the procedure for their<br>
rotation. In addition, Kiev proposed charging rent totaling between $1.4<br>
billion and $2.1 billion annually, depending on the aggregate size of the<br>
land and water areas leased to the Russian fleet. That part of the Black Sea<br>
fleet to be leased to Russia, with its coastal facilities, currently<br>
occupies 46,000 hectares of Ukrainian territory, much of it expensive<br>
Crimean land. Ukraine is willing to deduct the value of that rent from its<br>
debts to Russia, or to accept deliveries of Russian natural gas as payment<br>
for rent during the 20-year leasing period.<br>
	The Russian delegation broke off the talks, declining to set a date for<br>
their resumption, and senior military figures called for unilateral Russian<br>
action to appropriate the fleet and bases. Meanwhile, the Russian Duma<br>
threatened to discuss and adopt a draft law conferring "Russian status" on<br>
the city of Sevastopol. Only three weeks earlier, the chamber had<br>
overwhelmingly adopted a bill (which would require Federation Council and<br>
presidential approval to become law) halting the Black Sea Fleet's partition<br>
and declaring the fleet and its coastal facilities Russian property.<br>
Although such demands contradict official policy in Moscow, the Kremlin has<br>
recently begun using them as an additional argument for rushing Kiev into<br>
making concessions. For all of that, the latest rounds of talks seemed to<br>
demonstrate that excessive demands can backfire on Moscow, a result made<br>
even more likely when those demands are accompanied by territorial claims to<br>
Sevastopol from Russian presidential hopefuls or the Duma.<br>
<p>
NEW TWIST IN LEGAL BATTLE OVER CASPIAN RESOURCES <br>
	With regard to the Caspian Sea, Russian diplomacy is pressing for the<br>
adoption of a convention that would place a large part of seabed oil and gas<br>
deposits under the common jurisdiction of all the riparian states, rather<br>
than under national control. Those deposits, estimated to be immense despite<br>
still incomplete exploration, are concentrated in areas that would fall<br>
under Azerbaijani, Kazakh, or Turkmen jurisdiction if the sea and seabed<br>
were legally divided among the riparian countries.<br>
	Until very recently Moscow had refused to recognize any sectoral division<br>
in the Caspian Sea. In late October, however, Russia unveiled a new approach<br>
at the five-country negotiations on the Caspian Sea's legal status. It<br>
announced that it could accept national sectors and economic zones within<br>
certain limits, beyond which there would be created a large zone of common<br>
jurisdiction of the five countries. Moscow coordinated its position as usual<br>
with Tehran, its ally on this and other regional issues. Russian foreign<br>
minister Yevgeny Primakov officially introduced Moscow's revised proposals<br>
at the November 12 meeting in Ashgabat of the five Caspian countries'<br>
foreign ministers.<br>
	Russia now offers to recognize a 45-mile offshore economic zone for each<br>
country. It is also prepared to discuss, on a case-by-case basis, national<br>
jurisdiction over oil and gas deposits beyond the 45-mile line at sites<br>
where drilling is already in progress. All other deposits should be<br>
"commonly owned" through joint-stock companies of the five Caspian<br>
countries, Primakov insisted. Moreover, he proposed a "double-tender system"<br>
giving riparian countries first claim, ahead of non-Caspian bidders, in any<br>
future oil and gas contracts. As a sweetener he offered Russian recognition<br>
of 10- to 20-mile national fishing zones if the deal over minerals goes through.<br>
	Common jurisdiction as outlined by Primakov would entitle Russia to share<br>
in the other countries' mineral resources, secure a substantial cut in<br>
extraction projects undertaken by Western companies, impose the routing of<br>
export pipelines through Russia, and otherwise push its own interests in any<br>
decisions on production and marketing of  Caspian oil and gas. By the same<br>
token it would enable Moscow to restrict the ability of Azerbaijan,<br>
Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan to make their own transactions with Western<br>
partners. It would also introduce an unpredictable Iranian factor into the<br>
equation.<br>
	The double-tender rule would in practice give Russian oil companies<br>
preemptive rights over Western companies in prospecting and developing new<br>
deposits. Russia could profit massively, and yet, when unable to cope with<br>
technical problems because of its own technological retardation, Russia and<br>
its oil companies could either consent to involvement by Western companies<br>
for a price or frustrate Western involvement. This would be the likely<br>
result of the "common jurisdiction" system even in the absence of any<br>
purposeful obstruction. It would create legal havoc in the Caspian Sea, draw<br>
dividing lines through Azerbaijani, Kazakhstani, and Turkmen oil and gas<br>
deposits, produce political complications, and, obviously, discourage<br>
Western investments.<br>
	The three former Soviet republics around the Caspian Sea well understand<br>
that their independence and development are at stake. Azerbaijan and<br>
Kazakhstan champion sectoral division and national, as opposed to common,<br>
jurisdiction over mineral resources. Turkmenistan avoids taking a clear-cut<br>
position on the legal issue, but has until now followed the national<br>
approach in practice. At the Ashgabat negotiations, Turkmenistan appeared<br>
swayed into signing with Russia and Iran a statement of intent to discuss<br>
the creation of a joint company for offshore oil and gas prospecting and<br>
exploration. The apparent sop to its two neighbors does not look likely to<br>
advance their agenda in any significant way. Neither did the meeting of the<br>
five foreign ministers. Its only practical result was to relegate the issue<br>
to yet another group of experts for further negotiations.<br>

NEWS:<br>
<p>
PUBLIC TRUST IN YELTSIN FALLS. The number of Russians who say they trust<br>
President Boris Yeltsin has fallen sharply in recent months, according to a<br>
recent opinion poll. In June, 29 percent of Russians polled identified<br>
Yeltsin as the politician they trusted most. Now that number has dropped to<br>
10 percent. (AP, November 13)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN RECESSION DEEPENS. Total Russian output (GDP) shrank in the first 10<br>
months of this year by 6 percent over the first ten months of 1995.<br>
(Interfax, AP, November 14) This means that the decline in output is<br>
slightly worse than it was at the half-year mark, and that the outcome for<br>
1996 as a whole will be worse than either the Russian government or the IMF<br>
and the OECD were predicting earlier this year. <br>
 <br>
SHORTFALL IN REVENUES FROM PRIVATIZATION. The chairman of Russia's State<br>
Property Committee, Alfred Kokh, revealed yesterday that only 16 percent of<br>
planned revenues from privatization were obtained during the first nine<br>
months of this year. Kokh proposed reducing the annual revenue target from<br>
12 trillion rubles to approximately 9 trillion. (Interfax, November 14)<br>
<p>
MORE TALK OF NATO MEMBERSHIP FOR MOSCOW. Russian Defense Council secretary<br>
Yuri Baturin said in a radio interview on November 13 that he supports a<br>
proposal by his Security Council counterpart, Ivan Rybkin, that Russia<br>
should consider membership in NATO. But, although Baturin said that Russian<br>
membership in NATO would be a step forward for European security, he also<br>
conceded that the prospects of Russia getting into the alliance at this time<br>
are nil. (Ekho Moskvy, November 13)<br>
<p>
RODIONOV SIGNS MILITARY AGREEMENTS IN ITALY. During a visit to Rome<br>
yesterday Russian defense minister Igor Rodionov signed several military<br>
cooperation agreements with his Italian counterpart, Beniamino Andreatta.<br>
Describing them as the first high-level bilateral military accords between<br>
Russia and a NATO member, Rodionov said that Russia's partnership with NATO<br>
might best be developed on a bilateral basis. He also revealed that similar<br>
agreements are being prepared with other NATO members. (Itar-Tass, November 14)<br>
<p>
INDIA CONFIRMS PURCHASE OF RUSSIAN FIGHTERS. A spokesman for the Indian<br>
Defense Ministry confirmed yesterday that India would buy 40 Sukhoi-30<br>
multi-role jet fighters. He said the cabinet had approved the deal the<br>
previous evening. (Itar-Tass, November 14) The two-seat Su-30MK is an<br>
advanced variant of the Su-27 and was designed to replace the Su-24 strike<br>
aircraft. It can carry air-to-ground and air-to-air weapons and also<br>
incorporates enhanced maneuverability features.<br>
<p>
CHINESE AIR FORCE CHIEF VISITS RUSSIA. A Chinese military delegation led by<br>
Col. Gen. Yu Zhenwu, commander of the Chinese Air Force, arrived in Moscow<br>
yesterday for a six-day visit. The delegation will examine the latest models<br>
of Russian combat aircraft and is said to be particularly interested in the<br>
Su-37 fighter. The Chinese have indicated that they might be in the market<br>
for 50 new fighters to tide them over until a plant that they will use to<br>
build Su-27s under Russian license comes on line.(Itar-Tass, November 14)<br>
<p>
TALKS ON KURIL ISLANDS. Japanese foreign minister Yukihiko Ikeda will call<br>
for Moscow to recognize Japanese ownership of the Kuril Islands during talks<br>
today with his Russian counterpart. According to Japanese officials, Ikeda<br>
will probably also propose an expansion of visa-free exchange visits between<br>
Russians living on the islands and Japanese citizens. An expected Russian<br>
proposal for joint economic development of the islands is likely to be<br>
rejected until Moscow recognizes Japan's sovereignty over them, the<br>
officials added. (UPI, November 14)<br>
<p>
NORTH KOREA ACCUSED OF DRUG SMUGGLING. A Russian military intelligence<br>
official charged on November 13 that North Korea, in an effort to stave off<br>
an impending economic crisis, is smuggling illegal drugs through Russia's<br>
Far East. The official claimed that Pyongyang uses North Korean timber<br>
workers to move the narcotics. The official's remarks followed claims by a<br>
North Korean defector that the government in Pyongyang is secretly running<br>
poppy farms to produce the opium used in the drug trafficking. (Itar-Tass,<br>

PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
CHECHEN SIDE WILL NOT SIGN DRAFT AGREEMENT. Chechen deputy premier Movladi<br>
Udugov and an aide to Chechen president Zelimkhan Yandarbiev, Akhmed Zakaev,<br>
arrive in Moscow today to begin laying the groundwork for a planned meeting<br>
between Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Chechen prime<br>
minister Aslan Maskhadov. (NTV, November 14) Sources close to Maskhadov say<br>
the Chechen side will not sign the political agreement that Russian Security<br>
Council secretary Ivan Rybkin announced earlier in the week. (See Monitor,<br>
November 14) The Chechen leadership thinks the document should be<br>
exclusively economic. Moreover, the Chechen side intends to demand the<br>
withdrawal of Russia's 205th and 101st brigades, which Moscow wants to keep<br>
permanently stationed in Chechnya. The fate of the negotiations now hangs on<br>
the Russian government's readiness to withdraw these troops. Maskhadov's<br>
opinion on this issue is unknown; he has recently cut off all contact with<br>
the press. (NTV, November 14)<br>
<p>
The Chechen side has repeatedly said that it considers the main question on<br>
the agenda to be the payment of monetary compensation for the damage done to<br>
the republic during the war. Since the situation on the ground in Chechnya<br>
today is controlled by Chechen resistance fighters, and it is unrealistic to<br>
expect Russian troops to intervene again, the hope of receiving compensation<br>
from Moscow seems to be the main, if not the only, incentive for Grozny to<br>
continue negotiations with Moscow.<br>
<p>
All the factions in the Duma, with the exception of Yabloko, have come out<br>
against the Khasavyurt accords, and there can be no doubt that Grozny's new<br>
demands will elicit a negative reaction from the Russian political<br>
establishment. "Even if Ivan Rybkin had wanted to comply with the<br>
separatists' demands, it would have been hard for him to do so in the<br>
present political situation... The negotiations between the Security Council<br>
secretary and Movladi Udugov and Akhmed Zakaev will not be easy!" Arkady<br>
Volsky told Monitor. Volsky, a leading Russian industrialist, served on the<br>
Russian delegation to the negotiations with the Chechen resistance in the<br>
summer of 1995.<br>
<p>
USE OF BARTER AND SURROGATE MONEY INCREASING IN RUSSIA. Reports from several<br>
Russian regions refer to the introduction of surrogate money. Last month, a<br>
truck plant in Bashkortostan began to pay its workers in vouchers that can<br>
be used to buy goods in the plant's shops or to pay rent for company<br>
housing. Workers say the vouchers are preferable to going without their<br>
wages. (Information from Monitor's correspondent in Saratov) Last week, the<br>
authorities in Sverdlovsk oblast approved the issue of special checks that<br>
may be used in the region as a substitute for cash. (Trud, November 12)<br>
<p>
Such stories have prompted speculation about regions printing their own<br>
money as a way of asserting independence from Moscow. In fact, surrogate<br>
money tends to be confined to vouchers or credit notes that can only be used<br>
to purchase specific items from specific sources or traded for rubles at a<br>
large discount from their face value. <br>
<p>
Addressing a conference of American Slavicists in Boston on November 14,<br>
David Woodruff of MIT shed some light on this phenomenon. In the past three<br>
years, a combination of tight government monetary policies, the heavy burden<br>
of business taxes, and the government's efforts to avoid wide scale<br>
bankruptcies has left firms and regional governments struggling to cope with<br>
payment difficulties. Manufacturers lack money to pay electric bills, power<br>
stations cannot pay for oil and gas, and manufacturers, power stations, and<br>
energy companies are all short of money to pay wages and taxes.<br>
<p>
Producers have responded by resorting to barter and by printing surrogate<br>
money. Now the government's campaign to crack down on tax laggards is<br>
putting pressure on firms to pay taxes with money they do not have. If the<br>
government persists, widespread bankruptcies are likely to result. This may<br>
be the only way to resolve the payments crisis since it will weed out<br>
production for which there is no end-use.<br>
<p>
NO SURPRISE: BORDER FORCES WANT MORE MONEY. The director of Russia's Federal<br>
Border Forces (FBS) complains in a recent article that funding shortfalls<br>
have decimated his service's military technical base and imperiled Russia's<br>
national security. According to Gen. Andrei Nikolayev, the FBS current owes<br>
creditors some 733.5 billion rubles, and yet expects to receive only 38<br>
percent of what it had requested from the 1997 state budget. He also claims<br>
that funding shortfalls for weapons procurement have precluded the FBS from<br>
replacing aging hardware. The resulting deficit of ships, planes,<br>
helicopters, and radar equipment, Nikolayev says, has left the FBS unable to<br>
defend properly large portions of the Russian border.<br>
<p>
Nikolayev's complaints come amid a bruising budget battle in Moscow and<br>
follow charges from Russia's military leadership that the direction of<br>
scarce government funding to the nation's other "power structures" -- the<br>
FBS included -- has left the regular army destitute. This financial argument<br>
has been accompanied by the assertion that, in order to ensure Russia's<br>
national security, the army should be given pride of place in formulating<br>
defense spending priorities. <br>
<p>
Not surprisingly, Nikolayev paints a different picture. He suggests that, in<br>
the wake of the Soviet Union's dissolution, the FBS is now in many regards<br>
the country's first and chief line of defense. The FBS director claims that<br>
Russia's "natural resources are being ruthlessly plundered in the Okhotsk<br>
and Bering Seas, as well as in the Sea of Japan." More to the point,<br>
Nikolayev describes Russia's borders as "the testing grounds for probing the<br>
country's defense and economic potentials," and chides the military<br>
leadership for drafting concepts of future wars while "the border guards are<br>
already fighting." His remarks suggest that the FBS will fight<br>
well-publicized Defense Ministry efforts to win a redirection of state<br>
funding to the regular army from the other power ministries, and to force<br>
upon those other ministries manpower reductions on a scale equal to those<br>
being planned by the army. (Rossiiskie vesti, November 6. See also Monitor,<br>
August 26, September 19)<br>
<p>
CIS AFFAIRS<br>
<p>
ANOTHER DISASTER INVOLVING CIS AIRLINERS. The mid-air collision in India on<br>
November 12 of a Saudi Boeing 747 and a Kazakh Il-76 is but the latest in a<br>
string of recent air disasters involving the plethora of air carriers that<br>
have sprung up in the former Soviet Union. The Ilyushin cargo jet was on a<br>
charter flight from Chimkent in southern Kazakhstan to New Delhi for a<br>
Kyrgyz company. It was carrying 38 people. The airline had a history of<br>
financial problems. (Reuters, November 12)<br>
<p>
In their quest for hard currency, many of these outfits seem to be ready to<br>
deliver anything anywhere for anyone. Often, the fitness of their pilots,<br>
planes, and maintenance are suspect. In January, a cargo plane owned by<br>
Moscow Airlines carrying a Russian crew but leased to a Zairian company<br>
plowed into a crowded market after take-off in Kinshasa, Zaire. In August, a<br>
Tu-154 belonging to Vnukovo Airlines and carrying a group of coal minters<br>
crashed while landing on the Arctic island of Spitsbergen. Earlier in the<br>
same month an Il-76 belonging to Spaair of Yekaterinburg crashed near<br>
Belgrade en route to Malta with a cargo that included 744 kilograms of<br>
explosives. It was under charter to a Yugoslav firm. (Interfax-Eurasia,<br>
November 8) Even an episode with a happier ending illustrated the dubious<br>
nature of some of these charter missions. In August the 7-man Russian and<br>
Tatar crew of an Il-76 cargo transport escaped with its plane from<br>
Afghanistan after being held captive for more than a year by Taliban rebels.<br>
The plane, owned by a company in Kazan, had been leased to one in the United<br>
Arab Emirates to carry Chinese-made ammunition from Albania to Kabul. <br>
<p>
Certainly, not all of the air carriers in the CIS are of the fly-by-night<br>
variety. One of the most successful is Volga-Dnepr Airlines. It boasts a<br>
fleet that includes 6 giant An-124 "Ruslan" air freighters, and provides one<br>
of the best and safest heavy-lift air freight services in the world. <br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
RUSSIA RESUMING MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO GEORGIA. The defense ministers of<br>
Russia and Georgia, Gen. Igor Rodionov and Lt. Gen. Vardiko Nadibaidze,<br>
conferred in Moscow and finalized a program of Russian military assistance<br>
to Georgia. The program, including a timetable, envisages inter alia the<br>
transfer of Russian armored personnel carriers, artillery, firearms,<br>
ammunition, and naval vessels to Georgia's armed forces. Approved by<br>
Russia's Defense Council, the program is to come into effect this month. The<br>
commander of Russia's Federal Border Service, Gen. Andrei Nikolayev, is<br>
scheduled to visit Georgia also this month in order to renew cooperation<br>
with Georgia's border troops. (Kontakt, November 12-13) The naval vessels<br>
had been a desideratum pushed by Georgia's naval commander, Rear Adm.<br>
Aleksandr Javakhishvili, who remains in his post despite last week's rumor<br>
of his resignation. (Sakinform, November 6-7)<br>
<p>
Rodionov had announced the intention to resume military assistance to<br>
Georgia at last month's meeting of the CIS countries' defense ministers. The<br>
decision in effect reverses Moscow's move to suspend that assistance program<br>
when Georgia warned that it would ask Russian troops to leave the country<br>
because of Moscow's policy on the Abkhazia problem. Rodionov stated that he<br>
saw the program's renewal as a positive incentive to Georgia to ratify the<br>
1994 agreement, which would legalize Russian military bases in the country.<br>
Moscow's reversal suggests that president Eduard Shevardnadze's gamble in<br>
holding that agreement hostage to Russian support on Abkhazia might yield<br>
some momentary gains. <br>
<p>
SOUTH OSSETIA NOT TO SEEK EARLY UNIFICATION WITH THE NORTH. Final returns,<br>
issued yesterday, give South Ossetian Supreme Soviet chairman Lyudvig<br>
Chibirov 60 percent of the vote in the election to the newly created post of<br>
president of the republic. His opponents garnered 40 percent of the vote.<br>
Following his victory Chibirov came out for early resumption of negotiations<br>
with Georgian president Eduard Shevardnadze over South Ossetia's political<br>
status. Chibirov prejudged the issue to some extent by insisting that<br>
republic status be conferred on what Tbilisi regards as Georgia's Tskhinvali<br>
region. Chibirov also referred to relations with Tbilisi as a matter of<br>
South Ossetian "foreign policy." At the same time, however, Chibirov stated<br>
that "uniting the two Ossetias is unrealizable at the present stage."<br>
<p>
The Russian Federation's republic of North Ossetia evidenced a similar<br>
ambiguity. Its president, Akhsarbek Galazov, in a message congratulating<br>
Chibirov, advised him to pursue "normal relations with Georgia." That remark<br>
came despite the fact that, on the eve of South Ossetia's election day, the<br>
two Ossetias signed a treaty of cooperation and friendship, defined as a<br>
"natural continuation of the integration processes among North and South<br>
Ossetia." (Itar-Tass, November 9,14; BGI, November 12; Interfax, November 13)<br>
<p>
Chibirov himself has more than once indicated that unification with the<br>
North -- entailing in practice accession to the Russian Federation --<br>
remains an ultimate goal. Tbilisi nonetheless regards Chibirov as a relative<br>
moderate and hopes that his enhanced authority will enable him to show some<br>
flexibility at the upcoming negotiations. A possible compromise may be found<br>
in legalizing South Ossetia's de facto status as a republic in return for<br>
guarantees against secession from Georgia. <br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
UZBEKISTAN DEVELOPING LINKS WITH NATO. Uzbek president Islam Karimov<br>
conferred with NATO secretary-general Javier Solana and other top officials<br>
of the alliance at its Brussels headquarters. The talks focused on Central<br>
Asian security, Uzbekistan's participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace<br>
program, the Central Asian Battalion (CAB) created by Uzbekistan,<br>
Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, and planned PfP and CAB exercises. In an<br>
interview with the Brussels daily Le Soir, Karimov came out "against turning<br>
the CIS into a political-military bloc or creating supranational CIS<br>
institutions." He also spoke "against the chauvinist and imperialist<br>
tendencies sometimes noticeable in Russia." (Interfax, November 13-14)<br>
<p>
Of the Central Asian countries, Uzbekistan is the most active participant in<br>
the PfP. It sent military units to the Nugget-95 and Cooperative Osprey-96<br>
joint exercises held in the U.S., and it hosted the Balance Ultra-96 staff<br>
exercise with U.S. participation. The latter was the first-ever<br>
Western-initiated exercise in ex-Soviet Central Asia. The country has also<br>
become the foremost Central Asian opponent of the use of the CIS as a<br>
Russian policy instrument.<br>

NEWS:<br>
<p>
SPY WRANGLE INTENSIFIES. Moscow heightened its rhetoric yesterday over the<br>
FBI's well-publicized arrest of a former Soviet spy. A spokeswoman for<br>
Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) warned that a failure to release<br>
Aleksandr Galkin could result in an escalating cycle of retaliation that<br>
might harm bilateral relations. Galkin faces a second court hearing today in<br>
Massachusetts, and the SVR has suggested that retaliation -- possibly<br>
against retired U.S. intelligence officers visiting Russia -- could follow a<br>
decision displeasing to Moscow. (Reuter, Itar-Tass, November 13)<br>
<p>
POLISH-RUSSIAN TRADE AGREEMENTS. Following talks yesterday in Moscow, the<br>
prime ministers of Poland and Russia, together with their deputies, signed a<br>
series of agreements aimed at liberalizing bilateral trade and settling<br>
debts. Although details were not made public, talks were also held on<br>
military technical cooperation. On the divisive issue of NATO enlargement,<br>
the two sides limited themselves to restatements of their long-established<br>
positions. (Itar-Tass, November 13) Poland is a leading candidate for<br>
membership in NATO; Russia has vigorously opposed enlargement.<br>
<p>
PRIMAKOV TO JAPAN. Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov arrived in<br>
Tokyo today for a three-day visit that will include talks with his Japanese<br>
counterpart, Yukihiko Ikeda, and with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. Both<br>
sides have expressed optimism that the visit will boost bilateral relations,<br>
and a Japanese government official said he hoped for progress in the<br>
long-standing Kuril Islands dispute. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and<br>
Defense Minister Igor Rodionov are scheduled to make official visits next<br>
year to Japan. (Itar-Tass, November 13)<br>
<p>
CONCILIATORY COMMISSION FINISHES WORK ON THE BUDGET. Russia's new draft<br>
budget will be passed to the Duma for consideration on November 20. It<br>
contains a projected deficit of 3.5 percent of GDP, up from 3.3 percent in<br>
the original government proposal. Inflation, it is estimated, will run at an<br>
average annual rate of 11.8 percent (0.8 percent monthly). Duma First Deputy<br>
Chairman Aleksandr Shokhin said he was hopeful that the new draft would make<br>
IMF assistance possible. (Interfax, 13 November)<br>
<p>
ANOTHER TRIAL BALLOON ON NEW AIRBORNE COMMANDER. "Well informed" Russian<br>
Defense Ministry sources have said that Lt. Gen. Georgi Shpak, currently<br>
chief of staff in the Volga Military District, will soon be named the new<br>
commander of the Airborne Forces. He is a former paratrooper who once<br>
commanded the 76th Airborne Division. Last month similar sources suggested<br>
that a non-paratrooper, Lt. Gen. Igor Malakhov, would be named to the post.<br>
That news was greeted with disappointment within the Airborne Forces.<br>
(Interfax, November 13)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
DUMA TRIES TO ASSERT CONTROL OVER THE GOVERNMENT. The lower house of the<br>
Russian parliament, the Duma, has adopted in the second reading a federal<br>
constitutional law on the government of Russia. The law, passed 344-1 with<br>
one abstention, is expected to go to a third reading. All factions voted in<br>
favor except Yabloko, whose leader, Grigory Yavlinsky, called the law<br>
toothless and said would not have the desired results. The aim of the law is<br>
to make the government accountable to the Duma, something not provided for<br>
in the Russian Constitution. The law states, for example, that the prime<br>
minister and other cabinet members are obliged to reply to any questions<br>
parliament asks them. <br>
<p>
But the fact that this was a federal constitutional law meant that it<br>
required at least 300 votes for approval. That, in turn, led to some of the<br>
law's more radical features being toned down in order to get it through<br>
parliament. One article was dropped, for example, that would have given the<br>
Duma the right to approve appointments not only to the post of prime<br>
minister, but to a number of other key ministerial posts as well. It also<br>
contained a provision to the effect that the presidential staff has no<br>
authority with regard to the government. This is slippery ground. The<br>
Communist-dominated Duma wants to assert control over the government. But,<br>
on the principle that "my enemy's enemy is my friend," it also wants to<br>
strengthen the government's hand vis-a-vis the presidential apparatus. (ORT,<br>
Itar-Tass, Nezavisimaya gazeta, November 13)<br>
<p>
LEBED'S POLITICAL MOVEMENT GROWS. According to Yuri Shevtsov, a leader of<br>
the "Honor and Motherland" movement set up by Aleksandr Lebed in October<br>
1995, the movement now has 80,000 registered members and branches in 72 of<br>
Russia's 89 regions. The movement originally united officers -- active and<br>
retired -- who were opposed to policies enacted by former defense minister<br>
Pavel Grachev. But now, in addition to the officers and members of their<br>
families, the movement's membership has been swelled by an inflow of<br>
employees from the military-industrial complex and major industrial<br>
enterprises. The movement is to hold a congress in December at which it will<br>
decide whether or not to turn itself into a political party. Leaders of the<br>
movement have begun to doubt the usefulness of continuing their alliance<br>
with Sergei Glazyev's Democratic party and Dmitri Rogozin's Congress of<br>
Russian Communities, and may decide to cut the ties that have kept the<br>
groups together until now. (Nezavisimaya gazeta, November 13)<br>
<p>
TAX REVENUES INCREASE. Russia's federal government succeeded in collecting<br>
30 percent more tax revenue in October than in September, officials said.<br>
The government is particularly gratified since all the revenue came in the<br>
form of hard cash, not credit notes as in the past. Nonetheless, only 16<br>
percent of Russian enterprises have paid their taxes in full and on time.<br>
Companies specializing in oil extraction and oil processing have been the<br>
worst defaulters. Moreover, only 14 regions paid their tax bills in full,<br>
which means that 75 regions failed to pay all that they owed. In 22 regions,<br>
payments to the federal budget amounted to less than 30 per cent of the<br>
targeted amounts. More than 80 percent of all tax revenue came from four<br>
regions: Moscow city, the Khanty-Mansi and Yamal-Nenets Autonomous okrugs<br>
(Russia's largest oil-and gas-producing regions), and Sverdlovsk oblast.<br>
(Itar-Tass, Radio Mayak, November 11; RTR, November 12)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN DEFENSE POLICY: SEEKING A MODUS OPERANDI? A Russian newspaper<br>
suggested yesterday that a meeting of government and military leaders held<br>
November 12 in the Russian White House had been marked by a civility and<br>
pragmatism little in evidence during several other encounters between these<br>
two groups in recent days, or, for that matter, over the past half decade.<br>
(See Monitor, November 13) The White House meeting was attended by, on the<br>
one side, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Presidential Chief of Staff<br>
Anatoly Chubais, Security Council Secretary Yuri Baturin, and high-ranking<br>
representatives of several other government bodies. The military delegation<br>
included Defense Minister Igor Rodionov, General Staff chief Viktor<br>
Samsonov, Russia's other deputy defense ministers, and the commanders of the<br>
nation's military districts and fleets. Chernomyrdin attempted to make the<br>
prospect of future defense reductions more palatable to his audience by<br>
assuring them that this downsizing would be extended to Russia's other<br>
"power structures." He also said that he favored giving the General Staff<br>
the authority to coordinate the operational activities of these non-army<br>
ministries and agencies. <br>
<p>
Like Chernomyrdin, Rodionov emphasized in his remarks to the meeting that<br>
defense reductions were necessary in order to carry out military reform and<br>
to ensure the creation of a smaller but more capable military machine. He<br>
added that each service branch would be downsized "at its own pace." An<br>
unidentified Defense Ministry representative reportedly said that the<br>
military leadership is willing to consider cutting the armed forces to 1.2<br>
million troops, despite its preference for a force of 1.5 million, so long<br>
as the reductions are conducted on the "requisite financial base."<br>
(Kommersant-daily, November 13) <br>
<p>
Indeed, that formulation seems to be the implicit bargain that Rodionov is<br>
offering the political leadership. He has put his own authority and prestige<br>
on the line by publicly supporting the reduction in forces to 1.2 million,<br>
and has been criticized for it by such political figures as former Security<br>
Council secretary Aleksandr Lebed. But in return Rodionov appears to be<br>
demanding that the authority of the regular armed forces be raised within<br>
the broader security establishment as a whole, and, perhaps of greater<br>
importance, that the government deliver sufficient funding to carry the army<br>
through its difficult and unpopular transformation. Chernomyrdin's recent<br>
actions suggest a tentative assent by the government to this bargain, but<br>
its consummation will undoubtedly be opposed by, among others, the leaders<br>
of Russia's other "power ministries." That fact, together with the<br>
government's likely difficulty in coming up with sufficient funding to<br>
satisfy the military leadership, could make this fledgling political<br>
arrangement a difficult one to sustain. <br>
<p>
DRAFT RUSSIAN-CHECHEN AGREEMENT: BACK TO SQUARE ONE? Over the next several<br>
days a document could be signed that reflects the new political realities<br>
between Moscow and Grozny. According to Security Council Secretary Ivan<br>
Rybkin, the document will speak of military cooperation between Russia and<br>
Chechnya, and a declaration will be adopted stating that conflicts between<br>
Moscow and Grozny will henceforth not be resolved by force. (NTV, Ekho<br>
Moskvy, November 13) Vladimir Zorin, chairman of the State Duma's Committee<br>
on Nationalities, has told the Monitor that the prospective agreement will<br>
also address other basic questions, including the creation of a free<br>
economic zone (FEZ) on the territory of Chechnya, a mechanism for holding<br>
elections there, and the payment of compensation.<br>
<p>
The president of Ingushetia, Ruslan Aushev, told the Monitor that "the idea<br>
of creating a FEZ in Chechnya is reasonable. The FEZ on the territory of<br>
Ingushetia has given our republic quite a lot. But for the Chechen side, the<br>
formulation is very important. If this law states that the FEZ is part of<br>
the Russian Federation, then the Chechen side will never agree to it."<br>
<p>
But even an accord on creating a FEZ in Chechnya will still leave unresolved<br>
a key problem. According to Zorin, the notion that Chechnya should neither<br>
pay into, nor receive money from, the federal budget is "reminiscent of<br>
Chechnya under Djohar Dudaev before the intervention of Russian troops. At<br>
that time, mass quantities of goods not subject to taxation were brought<br>
into Grozny by charter flights from the so-called 'far abroad.' Sale of<br>
these goods in Russian markets became one of Chechens' main sources of<br>
income." Zorin warned that customs cordons would have to be erected on the<br>
borders of the FEZ. "After all," he said, "we have to make sure to defend<br>
the Russian market." In this context, it is probably no accident that the<br>
draft agreement stipulates that a 70-kilometer sector of the<br>
Georgian-Chechen border will be jointly guarded by Chechen resistance forces<br>
and Russian troops. (Ekho Moskvy, November 13) In other words, Moscow is<br>
proposing to Grozny an arrangement that is less attractive than that which<br>
existed before Russian troops intervened.<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
DUMA BACKS KEEPING RUSSIAN TROOPS IN MOLDOVA. The Russian Duma yesterday<br>
adopted a resolution that described Moldova's Transdniester region as a<br>
"zone of special strategic interest" to Russia and that requested the<br>
executive branch to "permanently station" Russian troops there. The Duma<br>
also asked the government to negotiate and conclude agreements on military<br>
and economic cooperation with Transdniester, to provide it with long-term<br>
credits and aid "to the extent feasible," and to open a consular service in<br>
Tiraspol. The Duma cited NATO's enlargement plans and Russia's "need to<br>
intensify links with compatriots abroad" as the grounds for its proposals.<br>
The resolution also claimed that "the great majority of Transdniester's<br>
population are Russians and Russian-speakers." Drafted by deputies of the<br>
ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic party of Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the<br>
resolution was approved by an overwhelming margin of 284 to 29. (Itar-Tass,<br>
Flux, November 13)<br>
<p>
In fact, only a quarter of Transdniester's population are Russians, most of<br>
them settlers from Russia. "Dniester Moldovan Republic" leader Igor Smirnov<br>
-- a Siberian -- had attended the Duma's October 16 hearings on the draft<br>
resolution, and was received afterward by Russian prime minister Viktor<br>
Chernomyrdin. Previously, Chernomyrdin had signed a 1994 agreement on<br>
withdrawing Russian troops. Yesterday's Duma resolution is not the first<br>
action by the Russian parliament that has provided a pretext for the Kremlin<br>
to refuse to carry out that military withdrawal agreement. <br>
<p>
DETAILS ON BLACK SEA FLEET TALKS REVEALED. Ukrainian first deputy prime<br>
minister Vasyl Durdinets, First Deputy Defense Minister Col. Gen. Ivan<br>
Bizhan, and other participants in the negotiations with Russia on the Black<br>
Sea Fleet have in recent days revealed some of the differences that have<br>
again led the talks into an impasse. (See Monitor, November 6) The Russian<br>
side opposes the siting of Ukraine's naval command in Sevastopol, claiming<br>
this right exclusively for the Russian command. It would also restrict<br>
Ukrainian ships to anchorages in only one bay -- Streletskaya -- of<br>
Sevastopol's five bays, and demands that the coastal infrastructure used by<br>
Russian ships be transferred to Russian ownership rather than continuing on<br>
the basis of leasing arrangements. The Russian side insists on retaining<br>
ground units attached to the fleet above ceilings set by the Conventional<br>
Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty.<br>
<p>
The Ukrainian side argues that the siting of its own naval command in<br>
Sevastopol and national ownership of the coastal infrastructure to be leased<br>
to Russia are non-negotiable prerogatives of state sovereignty. Kiev calls<br>
for the removal of those Russian ground units that exceed CFE limits. It<br>
also wants the bilateral agreements on the status of the Russian fleet and<br>
naval bases in Ukraine to stipulate maximum force ceilings, and also a<br>
mechanism for their rotation, in order to prevent ceiling breaches. <br>
<p>
Ukraine proposes to charge rent totaling between $1.4 billion and $2.1<br>
billion annually, depending on the aggregate size of the land and water<br>
areas to be leased to the Russian fleet. With its coastal facilities, that<br>
fleet currently occupies 46,000 hectares of Ukrainian territory, much of it<br>
expensive Crimean land. Ukraine is willing to deduct the value of the rent<br>
from its debts to Russia, or to accept deliveries of Russian natural gas as<br>
counting toward the rent during the 20-year leasing period.<br>
<p>
Officials in Kiev point out that Ukraine has "reached the limit of<br>
concessions" after having consented in earlier stages of the negotiations to<br>
a lopsided partition of the fleet in Russia's favor instead of declaring it<br>
Ukrainian property, and of having accepted the principle of long-term<br>
leasing of bases instead of setting a more stringent timetable for the<br>
Russian fleet's withdrawal. The officials are at the same time concerned<br>
that the prospect of anticipated presidential elections in Russia--even<br>
after Boris Yeltsin's apparently successful heart surgery--is forcing Prime<br>
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to adopt a rigid stance on the fleet and other<br>
unresolved issues in Russian-Ukrainian relations. (Interfax-Ukraine, UNIAN,<br>
November 10 through 13)<br>
<p>
BELARUS PRESIDENT SEEKS SUPPORT IN RUSSIAN DUMA. Belarusan president<br>
Aleksandr Lukashenko yesterday delivered an address in the Russian Duma at<br>
the Duma's invitation. In his remarks, Lukashenko presented himself as a<br>
champion of Belarus-Russia "integration," which, he said, should lead to<br>
"unity" and "unification." Lukashenko made thinly disguised pleas for<br>
Russian economic relief in the form of rescuing bankrupt Belarusan<br>
industrial enterprises and opening Russian markets to Belarusan agricultural<br>
products. Portraying his country and himself as guardians of Russia's and<br>
the Russia-Belarus Community's "western border," Lukashenko urged joint<br>
measures to counteract NATO's possible enlargement, and suggested that the<br>
withdrawal of the last remaining ex-Soviet strategic nuclear missiles from<br>
Belarus should be linked to guarantees that NATO will not deploy nuclear<br>
arms on the territories of its new member countries. Much of Lukashenko's<br>
address contained a defense of his constitutional referendum and appeals to<br>
the people back home to support him. <br>
<p>
The Duma's nationalist-Communist majority had agreed to offer Lukashenko its<br>
rostrum on the assumption that this would strengthen Lukashenko's hand at<br>
home and undermine his parliamentary opponents. The Duma's leadership turned<br>
down Belarus parliament chairman Syamyon Sharetsky's request to have<br>
Belarusan Central Election Commission chairman Viktar Hanchar address the<br>
Duma at the same time and comment on the unlawful nature of Lukashenko's<br>
referendum. Hanchar and other Belarusan deputies were on hand in the Duma<br>
but were not given the floor. Yabloko and Democratic Russia's Choice<br>
boycotted Lukashenko's address and issued statements protesting against the<br>
invitation extended to him, but these groups are too small to make a<br>
difference in the Duma.<br>
<p>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Presidential Administration Chief<br>
Anatoly Chubais received Lukashenko for talks that focused on economic<br>
relations. Chubais reiterated the Kremlin's position that Lukashenko's<br>
consent to holding his referendum on November 24, rather than on the<br>
originally scheduled date of November 7, represented an adequate<br>
"compromise" offer to the parliament. Chernomyrdin and Chubais commented<br>
neither on Lukashenko's bid for personal power nor on the fact that he did<br>
actually begin the referendum on November 7. (Interfax, Itar-Tass, November 13)<br>

<p>
CALL FOR A BIGGER DEFENSE BUDGET. Duma Defense Committee chairman Lev<br>
Rokhlin has dismissed a recent government decision that raises defense<br>
spending in the draft budget slightly -- to 102.8 trillion rubles. Rokhlin<br>
said his committee will press instead for the army to get the 160 trillion<br>
rubles that it had originally requested. The retired general claimed that<br>
the current level of defense spending is destroying the army. (Krasnaya<br>
zvezda, November 11. See below)<br>
<p>
RYBKIN AGAIN PROPOSES NATO MEMBERSHIP FOR RUSSIA. In an interview to appear<br>
today in the Russian magazine Itogi, Security Council secretary Ivan Rybkin<br>
repeats an earlier call for Russia to seek membership in NATO -- in both its<br>
military and political structures. (Interfax, Reuter, November 12) Russian<br>
foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov had repudiated an earlier, similar call by<br>
Rybkin for Russian membership in NATO. He also told the Security Council<br>
secretary to leave foreign policy to the Foreign Ministry. (See Monitor,<br>
November 4)<br>
<p>
CAVIAR SHORTAGE THREATENS. The World Wildlife Fund warns in a report<br>
published this week that sturgeon species, from which caviar is obtained,<br>
are on the brink of extinction because of aggressive fishing by Russian and<br>
Iranian trawlers. The report says up to 90 percent of caviar is now obtained<br>
by illegal trade. Soviet-era laws remain on the books but are generally<br>
disregarded, the report says. (AP, November 11)<br>
<p>
JAPAN TO HELP BUILD PLUTONIUM PROCESSING PLANT. The Japanese government is<br>
joining Germany and France to help Russia build a plant that will turn<br>
weapons-grade plutonium into fuel for nuclear power plants. The facility is<br>
expected to be able to process one metric ton of plutonium each year once it<br>
becomes operational after the turn of the century. Russia is believed to<br>
have some 200 tons of weapons-grade plutonium. (RIA Novosti, November 12)<br>
<p>
DESPITE ASSURANCES, SAILORS NOT PAID. The personnel in the Russian Northern<br>
and Pacific Fleets are not getting their back wages despite official<br>
assurances that they would. According to the first deputy commander of the<br>
Pacific Fleet, only 7 billion rubles of the fleet's 450 billion ruble wage<br>
arrears have been received. A delegation from the "Russia is Our Home"<br>
faction in the State Duma visiting Murmansk was told that personnel in the<br>
Northern Fleet have not been paid since July. (Russia TV, November 11-12.<br>
See below)<br>
<p>
MUSICIANS ROBBED. Musicians of the Shostakovich Philharmonia Society,<br>
returning to Russia after a tour of Japan, were robbed soon after arriving<br>
at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Airport. A passenger in the airport bus<br>
pretended to be choking; when he asked the bus to stop, armed men boarded<br>
and robbed the musicians of the hard currency they had earned abroad.<br>
(Itar-Tass, November 12)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN DEFENSE POLICY DEBATE PROVES DIVISIVE. More than a few discordant<br>
notes were struck over the past several days as civilian and military<br>
leaders huddled in Moscow to discuss the army's financial crisis and<br>
military reform. During a second meeting of Russia's recently created<br>
Defense Council on November 11, the heads of Russia's various "power<br>
ministries" reportedly complained that the government has already fallen<br>
behind in its commitment, made just last month, to clear up wage and payment<br>
arrears to military personnel. In response, First Deputy Finance Minister<br>
Vladimir Petrov pledged to the meeting's participants that the entire wage<br>
debt to the armed forces would be repaid by November 15. (RTR, November 11)<br>
<p>
But the meeting was more noteworthy for a sharp clash that occurred between<br>
Defense Council secretary Yuri Baturin and Defense Minister Igor Rodionov.<br>
While few details were available, differences reportedly arose because of<br>
Baturin's efforts in recent weeks to force a reconsideration of a 1993<br>
document on the fundamentals of Russia's military doctrine. Baturin, whose<br>
views ultimately prevailed at the meeting, argued that the old document no<br>
longer provides sufficient guidance for Russian defense planners in coming<br>
to terms with changing geopolitical circumstances and the obvious weaknesses<br>
-- s evidenced during the war in Chechnya -- of Russia's conventional<br>
forces. One Russian report suggested that Rodionov's opposition to Baturin's<br>
proposal was based less on any loyalty to the substance of the 1993 military<br>
doctrine than on the Defense Ministry's unwillingness to cede control over<br>
military policy to the Defense Council and civilian defense experts. (RTR,<br>
ORT, November 11; Segodnya, November 12)<br>
<p>
Harmony was in no greater evidence yesterday. In remarks covered by NTV,<br>
Rodionov told a meeting of military leaders that Russia's armed forces "had<br>
reached a point beyond which any further lowering of their combat readiness<br>
could lead to unpredictable and catastrophic consequences." Rodionov also<br>
suggested that Russia's "deepening economic crisis" and "social instability"<br>
had exacerbated readiness problems in the armed forces, and he warned that<br>
the nation could be caught unprepared if global or regional tensions<br>
worsened. (Reuter, Itar-Tass, November 12) <br>
<p>
Rodionov's alarmist remarks, which reflect both real problems in the army<br>
and an effort to influence the defense budget debate, were an inauspicious<br>
curtain raiser for Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who addressed a<br>
separate meeting of military leaders later in the day. Chernomyrdin told the<br>
officers that defense reductions are a painful but necessary means of<br>
ensuring the country's security. The prime minister, who had chaired the<br>
previous day's Defense Council meeting, also discussed the situation in the<br>
armed forces in a telephone conversation with President Boris Yeltsin<br>
yesterday. (Reuter, Itar-Tass, November 12)<br>
<p>
KREMLIN PUTS BRAVE FACE ON ELECTORAL DEFEATS. Prime Minister Viktor<br>
Chernomyrdin yesterday received fifteen of Russia's newly-elected regional<br>
governors and congratulated them on their victories. (RTR, November 12)<br>
Chernomyrdin said the Kremlin was willing to sign power-sharing agreements<br>
between the federal center and whichever of Russia's regions wants to be<br>
next to sign such a deal. The prime minister put a brave face on the fact<br>
that seven of the fifteen were elected on anti-government platforms. The<br>
government is insisting that the newly elected governors of Leningrad,<br>
Kaliningrad, Magadan and Kaluga oblasts are experienced and pragmatic<br>
managers with whom the center can do business. The Kremlin will admit to<br>
being seriously unhappy only about the elections of former vice president<br>
Aleksandr Rutskoi in Kursk oblast and of a member of Vladimir Zhirinovsky's<br>
ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic party in Pskov oblast. (RTR, November<br>
12) As for Rutskoi, he has already gone to Moscow bearing an olive branch.<br>
There he astutely paid a courtesy call on Anatoly Chubais and assured the<br>
powerful chief of the presidential administration that he will cooperate<br>
fully with the federal center. Rutskoi has been taken under the wing of the<br>
liberal governor of Nizhni Novgorod, Boris Nemtsov, who attended Rutskoi's<br>
inauguration last weekend and presented the former Air Force general with a<br>
saber. <br>
<p>
RYBKIN IN CHECHNYA FOR TALKS WITH RESISTANCE LEADERS. Russian security<br>
council secretary Ivan Rybkin yesterday visited Chechnya and took part in<br>
the work of the joint commission on regulating the Chechen peace process. In<br>
the evening, Rybkin met in Nazran with members of the Chechen government.<br>
The leaders of the other North Caucasus republics and the governor of<br>
Stavropol krai were also present. (Interfax, November 12) The main item on<br>
the agenda in both Nazran and Grozny was restoration of the Chechen economy.<br>
Moscow continues to support the idea of creating a free economic zone on the<br>
territory of Chechnya. According to the draft proposal currently being<br>
discussed by the Russian government and Duma, Chechnya would be exempt from<br>
paying taxes to Moscow but would receive no money from the federal budget. <br>
<p>
This will hardly satisfy the Chechen leaders, who are demanding compensation<br>
from Moscow for the damage done to the republic during 21 months of<br>
fighting. According to Chechen deputy premier Movladi Udugov, a special<br>
commission is already taking inventory in order to assess the damage done by<br>
the Russian army. Moreover, Udugov says, there are 100,000 armed, unemployed<br>
men in Chechnya with families to feed. If Moscow refuses to pay<br>
compensation, these men will be tempted to take their weapons in search of<br>
money in the regions of Russia bordering Chechnya. (NTV, November 10)<br>
<p>
Russia appears, however, to have no intention of paying compensation<br>
unilaterally. "When there is a fight, both sides suffer damage, and both<br>
sides need compensation," Rybkin told journalists at Grozny airport. (NTV,<br>
November 12) A further stumbling block arises from Moscow's proposal to<br>
create a special administration in the free economic zone on the territory<br>
of Chechnya, directly subordinate to the federal center, which would<br>
therefore become the highest government body in Chechnya. Naturally, this<br>
proposal is unacceptable to Chechen leaders, who say Chechnya is an<br>
independent state.<br>
<p>
Disagreement on these questions apparently prompted the two sides to agree<br>
in Nazran to postpone for two and a half months the signing of a new<br>
bilateral agreement. Moscow may be hoping that, during this time, the<br>
leaders of the war-torn republic, which is half-destroyed and absolutely<br>
unprepared for the winter cold, will become more tractable. (NTV, November 12)<br>
<p>
CIS AFFAIRS<br>
<p>
RUSSIA TO INCREASE SUPPORT TO CIS COUNTRIES. Russia's financial support to<br>
the CIS countries has been dwindling in recent years. Concurrently, however,<br>
awareness of the importance of the CIS market for Russian exports has been<br>
building among Russian government and business leaders. Increasingly, they<br>
see the CIS as a convenient and necessary outlet by which to effect a change<br>
in Russia's export commodity structure that would reduce the share of energy<br>
and raw materials while increasing that of manufactured goods. <br>
<p>
A decision taken yesterday by the Russian government commission on<br>
operational questions reflects this change of attitude. The commission,<br>
chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Aleksei Bolshakov, decided that credits to<br>
CIS countries in the 1997 draft budget should increase dramatically -- from<br>
200 billion rubles to 3 trillion rubles. (Interfax, November 12) The<br>
additional credits are aimed explicitly at raising Russian exports, since<br>
they can be used only for the purchase of Russian goods. <br>
<p>
The concession of new loans will add to the present CIS countries' debt to<br>
Russia, which, according to CIS Affairs Minister Aman Tuleev, currently<br>
amounts to $6 billion. (Interfax, November 12) In the past, Russian credits<br>
to the CIS states have been dollar denominated and have carried variable<br>
interest rates. Russia has sought, with varying degrees of success, to<br>
cancel part of these debts in exchange for assets in the debtor countries.<br>
In addition to these inter-state debts, non-payment to Russian energy<br>
producers by their consumers in the CIS amounts to 16 trillion rubles,<br>
according to Tuleev. <br>
<p>
Recent trends have tended, however, to erode these long-standing Russian<br>
trade surpluses, and the earlier reductions in credits to CIS countries may<br>
be one of the culprits. Trade with the CIS countries has been growing more<br>
rapidly than with the rest of the world. According to Russian deputy prime<br>
minister Valery Serov, turnover between Russia and the CIS countries<br>
increased by 20 percent over the last 9 months. (Interfax, November 11)<br>
Russian imports, moreover, have been growing at a faster pace than exports,<br>
leading to deficits for Russia in its trade with CIS countries. <br>
<p>
THE BALTIC STATES<br>
<p>
LITHUANIAN CONSERVATIVES SEAL OFF ELECTORAL TRIUMPH. Fatherland Union-The<br>
Conservatives and that party's allies increased their gains in the new<br>
Lithuanian parliament in the second round of the legislative elections. Held<br>
on November 10, the second round involved runoffs in the single<br>
mandate-constituencies. The final returns, issued yesterday, show that the<br>
FU will have 70 seats, the Christian-Democrats 16 seats, and like-minded<br>
"rightist" or "center-right" groups 5 seats, for a total of 91 of the 137<br>
seats adjudicated in the two rounds of the election. Repeat elections will<br>
later be held in four, mainly ethnic Polish constituencies where the turnout<br>
was insufficient for a valid election. The hitherto governing Democratic<br>
Labor party, which had won an absolute majority in the preceding elections<br>
(1992), obtained only 12 seats this time. Originating in the reformist and<br>
pro-independence wing of the Communist party, the DLP lost popularity<br>
because of its perceived mismanagement of reforms and involvement in corruption.<br>
<p>
President Algirdas Brazauskas, whose political roots are in the DLP, told<br>
the country on radio that he is prepared to work closely with FU and its<br>
allies. Brazauskas reminded the public that he had forced LDP prime minister<br>
and party leader Adolfas Slezevicius and other officials tainted with<br>
corruption to resign. FU and CD leaders, meanwhile, reaffirmed their<br>
campaign pledges to accelerate free market reforms, pursue a clear-cut<br>
Western orientation, and seek to improve relations with Russia. (BNS, ELTA,<br>
Radio Vilnius, November 11 and 12)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
RUSSIA-UKRAINE: VISIT OFF, PRESSURE ON. In the wake of Kiev's recent<br>
decision to resist escalating Russian demands in negotiations on the Black<br>
Sea Fleet (see Monitor, November 7), Russia's Duma is considering a bill<br>
today that would confer "Russian status" on the Ukrainian city of<br>
Sevastopol. Cleared by three Duma committees for floor action, the bill<br>
stipulates that Sevastopol was not transferred to Ukraine with the Crimea,<br>
and that the city is to constitute "the main base of Russia's Black Sea<br>
Fleet." President Boris Yeltsin's foreign policy adviser, Dmitry Ryurikov,<br>
publicly advised Kiev yesterday against describing the Sevastopol bill as<br>
"some kind of territorial claim." The Duma had on October 23 adopted almost<br>
unanimously -- with the approval of the government faction "Russia is Our<br>
Home" -- a bill halting the fleet's partition and declaring the fleet and<br>
its coastal facilities Russian property.<br>
<p>
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mikhail Demurin announced yesterday that<br>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin would not visit Ukraine after all. In an<br>
obvious reference to the stalled negotiations on the fleet, Demurin said<br>
that the visit can take place "when the documents that should be prepared<br>
for the visit are ready." Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma publicly asked<br>
Moscow to go ahead with the visit without preconditions, so as to "confirm<br>
the Russian side's intention to continue the dialogue with Ukraine."<br>
Bilateral relations extend far beyond the issues of the fleet and<br>
Sevastopol, Kuchma remarked. (Itar-Tass, Interfax, November 12). <br>
<p>
Kiev is anxious to discuss with Chernomyrdin reliable Russian gas supplies,<br>
removal of Russian trade barriers on Ukrainian goods, official recognition<br>
of existing borders, and the interstate political treaty. But Moscow<br>
continues to hold those issues, as well as Chernomyrdin's visit, hostage to<br>
an agreement on the fleet and its bases.<br>
<p>
KIEV PONDERS APPEAL FOR INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry<br>
leaders said yesterday that Kiev would, if necessary, turn to the<br>
international community, and specifically to permanent members of the UN<br>
Security Council and to the OSCE, with a request to protect Ukraine's<br>
territorial integrity. Ukrainian foreign minister Hennady Udovenko and his<br>
first deputy, Anton Buteiko, stated that the Duma's two bills and the<br>
deadlock in the fleet talks (see above) could impel Ukraine to appeal to the<br>
U.S. in its capacity as a co-guarantor of Ukraine's independence,<br>
territorial integrity, and inviolability of its borders. Udovenko and<br>
Buteiko recalled that the U.S., Britain, France, and Russia had extended<br>
those written guarantees in 1994, in connection with Ukraine's renunciation<br>
of its nuclear arsenal and its accession to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty.<br>
<p>
The Ukrainian parliament's foreign policy commission chairman, Boris<br>
Oliinik, stated that the legislature is prepared to consider a draft law on<br>
declaring the Black Sea Fleet a foreign force unlawfully stationed in<br>
Ukraine and setting a deadline for its withdrawal. (Interfax-Ukraine, UNIAN,<br>
November 12) Kiev's moves seem to be aimed at dissuading the Duma from<br>
exacerbating tensions, at encouraging the Russian executive branch to resist<br>
the Duma's action, and at protecting relations between the two governments<br>
from a damaging spillover. <br>
<p>
THE TERMINOLOGY: WRANGLING OVER BASES IN SEVASTOPOL. A sticking point in the<br>
five-year talks between Russia and Ukraine over the division of the former<br>
Soviet Black Sea Fleet remains the bases -- or more precisely -- one base:<br>
the historic naval stronghold of Sevastopol. Ukrainian first deputy prime<br>
minister Vasily Durdinets said yesterday that this was the "overriding<br>
issue. A definition of separate bases should be worked out again."<br>
(Interfax-Ukraine, November 12)<br>
<p>
The issue is at least in part one of semantics and national pride. The<br>
Russians still insist that Sevastopol -- the entire city -- will serve as<br>
the base of their Black Sea Fleet, while the Ukrainians will only allow the<br>
Russians to have a base in Sevastopol. The two sides long ago agreed what<br>
this means: the Russians can use the largest inlet in the city,<br>
Sevastopolskaya Bay, and the Southern Bay that branches off of it, the<br>
historic site of the Crimean War naval facilities. On November 11, Ukrainian<br>
first deputy defense minister Ivan Bizhan pointed out that these two bodies<br>
of water contain 517 moorages, more than enough for the Russians.<br>
(Interfax-Ukraine, November 11) For its part, the Ukrainian Navy would<br>
utilize only three smaller bays -- Streletskaya, Karantinnaya, and Kazakchya<br>
-- that are well to the west of the city proper and open to the Black Sea<br>
itself rather than to either of the bays the Russians would use. <br>

<p>
NEWS:<br>
<p>
KORZHAKOV TO RUN FOR DUMA. President Yeltsin's former bodyguard and security<br>
chief, Aleksandr Korzhakov, has cleared a hurdle on the way to a seat in the<br>
Russian parliament -- which would also give him coveted immunity from<br>
prosecution. Korzhakov's supporters have collected 8,000 signatures to<br>
support his candidacy in the by-election to be held in Tula in February, and<br>
submitted them to the local authorities with a request for him to be<br>
registered as a candidate. (Itar-Tass, November 11)<br>
<p>
DUMA APPEALS TO CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. The Russian parliament has voted by a<br>
substantial majority to ask the Constitutional Court to rule on the powers<br>
that President Yeltsin has vested in his administration. Deputies complained<br>
that Chief-of-Staff Anatoly Chubais has been granted powers that, under the<br>
constitution, rightfully belong to other state bodies. (RTR, November 11)<br>
<p>
PRIMAKOV HEADS EAST. Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov departed from<br>
Moscow yesterday for a nine-day trip to Turkmenistan, Mongolia, Japan, and<br>
China. In Tokyo Primakov and Japanese leaders are expected to discuss trade<br>
and economic cooperation; the disputed Kuril Islands will also be on the<br>
agenda. While in China from November 17-19 Primakov will help prepare for<br>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's planned visit next year. Discussion<br>
topics there may include military reductions along the Russo-Chinese border.<br>
(Reuter, November 11)<br>
<p>
NO NATO APPLICATION FROM MOSCOW. During a November 10 interview on Russian<br>
television, NATO secretary-general Javier Solana deflected a question on<br>
whether Russia might join the Western alliance, as has recently been<br>
proposed by Russian Security Council secretary Ivan Rybkin. Solana<br>
emphasized that Russia had made no application to join NATO. He also said<br>
the alliance wants to deepen its military and political relations with<br>
Russia. Rybkin had called for Russia's entry into NATO's political<br>
structures. (RTR, November 10; see also Monitor, November 4)<br>
<p>
REMAINS OF 400 RUSSIAN SOLDIERS UNIDENTIFIED. The remains of more than 400<br>
Russian soldiers killed in Chechnya remain unidentified at the military<br>
forensic laboratory in Rostov-na-Donu. According to Sergei Osipov, a member<br>
of President Yeltsin's commission for POWs, detainees and missing, the<br>
identification process is poorly financed with the result that the experts<br>
have managed to identify only one soldier per day. A total of 1,345 military<br>
personnel are listed as missing in Chechnya. (Interfax, November 11)<br>
<p>
RUSSIA NEEDS HELP TO DESTROY CHEMICAL WEAPONS. Western financial aid of $100<br>
million is needed for the construction of a special plant to destroy Russian<br>
chemical weapons. But according to Col. Gen. Stanislav Petrov, chief of the<br>
Chemical Troops, Russia has thus far received less than one-tenth of that<br>
amount. Several plants will be needed to dispose of Russia's 40,000 metric<br>
tons of chemicals. Petrov said that Russia's failure to ratify the Chemical<br>
Weapons Convention could discourage more aid. (Itar-Tass, November 11)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
IMPROVING YELTSIN TO ADDRESS NATION. President Boris Yeltsin's press<br>
secretary says the president will make an address to the nation by the end<br>
of this week. (RTR, November 11) He did not say whether the address would be<br>
on radio or television. Until undergoing surgery a week ago, Yeltsin was<br>
delivering a weekly radio address to the nation. Kremlin doctor Sergei<br>
Mironov told Russian television on November 10 that Yeltsin was likely to be<br>
discharged from the hospital and moved back to the Barvikha sanitarium<br>
outside Moscow "after November 20 or 22." Over the weekend Yeltsin's<br>
surgeon, Renat Akchurin, revealed that the president was in such bad shape<br>
after his heart attack in July that he was considered at that time to have<br>
only a 50-50 chance of surviving a bypass operation. (AP, November 11) <br>
<p>
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT ORDERS INVESTIGATION OF MOSCOW CEMETERY BOMBING. Boris<br>
Yeltsin has ordered a full investigation into the November 10 bomb blast at<br>
a south Moscow cemetery in which 14 people were killed. (NTV, RTR, November<br>
11) The explosion killed the head of the Fund for Invalids of the Afghan<br>
War, Sergei Trakhirov. Stung by a rebuke from Prime Minister Viktor<br>
Chernomyrdin that the bombing had occurred on the very day Russians annually<br>
honor the militia, Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov announced that he was<br>
entrusting the investigation to his own first deputy. Police said the bomb<br>
was clearly a settling of scores among criminals who use veterans' groups --<br>
which benefit from generous tax and excise exemptions on imports and exports<br>
-- as a means of evading tax and laundering money. (Reuters, November 11)<br>
The Russian police do not have a good track record in bringing the<br>
perpetrators of contract killings to justice.<br>
<p>
LEBED ON FATE OF CHERNOMYRDIN; CHECHNYA AND BIG BUSINESS. In an interview<br>
published in yesterday's Komsomolskaya pravda, ousted Russian Security<br>
Council secretary Aleksandr Lebed predicted that Prime Minister Viktor<br>
Chernomyrdin will soon be made the scapegoat for Russia's financial problems<br>
and be dismissed from his post. His place, according to Lebed, will go to<br>
the chief of the presidential staff, Anatoly Chubais. Lebed said the<br>
scenario will resemble the ouster of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev,<br>
replaced in a palace coup by Leonid Brezhnev in 1964. Chubais will use his<br>
business contacts to pay off wage and pensions arrears as soon as<br>
Chernomyrdin is dismissed, Lebed said. According to the retired general,<br>
when Khrushchev was deposed, stores were empty and people were panicking.<br>
"Along comes Brezhnev. And all of a sudden, everything appears in the shops<br>
-- vodka, wine and even caviar. Everybody shouts  'Hoorah!' That's Chubais'<br>
plan, too", Lebed said. (Komsomolskaya pravda, Itar-Tass, November 11)<br>
<p>
Lebed also said that fighting was unlikely to break out again in Chechnya<br>
because he had broken the backbone of the conflict. He ascribed the<br>
appointment of Boris Berezovsky to the Security Council as an effort to<br>
ensure safe passage for Caspian oil from Azerbaijan through Chechnya to<br>
Russia's Black Sea port of Novorossiisk. According to Lebed, "If the<br>
pipeline goes to Novorossiisk, the restoration of the Chechen economy is<br>
guaranteed within six months... If the Chechens agree to lay the pipeline on<br>
conditions profitable to big business, Berezovsky will act as peacemaker,"<br>
Lebed said. <br>
<p>
EASTERN EUROPEANS WANT A VOICE IN NATO-RUSSIA TALKS. In a reversal on a now<br>
familiar theme, two Eastern European leaders have urged that countries<br>
seeking NATO membership be given a voice in talks on a political agreement<br>
between the Western alliance and Russia. Moscow has long sought -- directly<br>
or indirectly -- to influence NATO's deliberations on the admission of new<br>
member-states from the former Soviet bloc. But following talks in Prague<br>
yesterday, the foreign ministers of Hungary and the Czech Republic tried to<br>
turn the tables. "For us NATO allies, it is very important that the debate<br>
with Russia not take place over our heads," Czech foreign minister Josef<br>
Zieleniec told a press conference. NATO, he said, should "have a system of<br>
consultation with the would-be members in this respect... It is our interest<br>
to have a statement and influence the position of NATO in these<br>
negotiations." (Reuter, November 11)<br>
<p>
The Czech Republic and Hungary, along with Poland, are the top candidates<br>
for membership in a NATO induction process that is expected to begin in the<br>
middle of next year. The alliance has also been conducting negotiations with<br>
Russia in hopes of concluding a parallel political -- or "charter" --<br>
agreement with Moscow. The Kremlin has worked aggressively to elevate the<br>
status of its talks with NATO above those of the Eastern Europeans, and by<br>
that means to influence or, preferably, to halt altogether the enlargement<br>
process. The statements made yesterday in Prague may reflect a more<br>
proactive policy by Eastern European leaders that is aimed at least in part<br>
at putting Moscow on the defensive. <br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
BELARUS REFERENDUM FARCICAL, BUT LUKASHENKO'S THREATS SERIOUS. On President<br>
Aleksandr Lukashenko's orders, voting in the constitutional referendum began<br>
on November 9, ostensibly for citizens unable to turn out on the officially<br>
scheduled date, November 24. The president's order came despite the fact<br>
that the draft constitution has not yet been finalized, much less printed,<br>
while a rival parliamentary draft, although completed, cannot be publicized<br>
because of presidential control of publishing and the media. As the polls<br>
opened, Lukashenko "overruled" by decree the latest Constitutional Court<br>
verdict and related parliamentary decisions. The Court had ruled the<br>
constitutional referendum consultative and its outcome nonbinding, and the<br>
parliament had resolved to abide by the Court's verdict and by the existing<br>
constitution. <br>
<p>
Lukashenko's decree served notice that he would dissolve state bodies that<br>
"hamper" the conduct of the referendum or fail to abide by its results. But<br>
the targeted institutions braved the threat. Parliament chairman Syamyon<br>
Sharetsky stated that the referendum is proceeding "through lawlessness and<br>
deception," and Central Election Commission chairman Viktar Hanchar<br>
announced that the CEC would refuse to recognize the results of the<br>
balloting. Citing leaks from presidential officials about plans to suspend<br>
the Constitutional Court, its chairman, Valery Tsikhinya, warned Lukashenko<br>
against incurring criminal responsibility and risking the fate of Romania's<br>
executed dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu.<br>
<p>
Lukashenko appears less than confident. Addressing the country on radio on<br>
the first day of balloting, the president thrice admitted to "anxiety," but<br>
vowed to cling to power against the "political adventurers" in parliament.<br>
(Belaplan, Radio Minsk, Interfax, November 9 through 11)<br>
<p>
MOLDOVA HAS ITS OWN WATERGATE. Battling for reelection against Prime<br>
Minister Andrei Sangheli and Parliament Chairman Petru Lucinschi, an<br>
insecure President Mircea Snegur is multiplying threats to dismiss the<br>
cabinet of ministers and dissolve the parliament, by referendum if<br>
necessary. The Moldovan Constitution does not empower the president to take<br>
any of these steps, but Snegur is also campaigning to change the<br>
constitution and to establish a presidential republic.<br>
<p>
The campaign, moreover, is climaxing with a wiretapping scandal that has<br>
been dubbed Moldova's Watergate. Last week, employees said to be from a<br>
presidentially-controlled security service disseminated cassette recordings<br>
and transcripts of a telephone conversation between Snegur's most powerful<br>
political lieutenant and the Moldovan ambassador to Germany. The<br>
conversation dealt with arranging media coverage of corruption accusations<br>
leveled by the ambassador against the foreign minister and the cabinet of<br>
ministers in an attempt to hurt Sangheli and his Agrarian Democratic party.<br>
The ambassador had recently issued unsubstantiated accusations to that<br>
effect from his post, and was publicly shielded by Snegur. The press<br>
reported the content of the telephone intercept, and state television aired<br>
it. The president now demands prosecution of the unidentified wiretappers<br>
and of the TV chiefs for airing the tape; the prosecutor general has<br>
launched a criminal investigation. (Basapress, Flux, Interfax, November 8<br>
through 11)<br>
<p>
The incident has served to draw attention to the presidentially-controlled<br>
security service, headed by the brother of  Snegur's aforementioned chief<br>
lieutenant. The service functions outside legal or financial accountability<br>
and is widely believed in Chisinau political circles to wiretap and keep<br>
tabs on the president's political opponents. <br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
ARMENIAN PRESIDENT INAUGURATED, GOVERNMENT INSTALLED. Armenian president<br>
Levon Ter-Petrosian was inaugurated yesterday to a second term of five<br>
years. The act prejudged the decision due shortly from the Constitutional<br>
Court, which is now examining the united opposition's case against official<br>
fraud in the September 22 presidential election. Those proceedings went<br>
unmentioned at yesterday's presidential inauguration. Of the opposition<br>
parliamentary groups, only the Communists attended the ceremony. The<br>
nonCommunist opposition, forbidden to operate, also boycotted local<br>
elections that were held on November 10 amid distrust of the integrity of<br>
the process. (Interfax, November 11)<br>
<p>
The president has formed a new cabinet of ministers under Prime Minister<br>
Armen Sarkisian, comprised of 23 members, 8 of them new. Aleksandr<br>
Arzumanian, formerly ambassador to the UN, replaces Vahan Papazian as<br>
foreign minister; Papazian described himself as overworked in his last<br>
interview in office. The Ministries of Internal Affairs and State Security<br>
have been merged into a superministry to be headed by Serge Sarkisian,<br>
hitherto security minister. The controversial internal affairs minister,<br>
Vano Siradeghian, was appointed mayor of Yerevan by the president. The<br>
former Armenian Communist party's First Secretary, Vladimir Movsisian, and<br>
the former Armenian Komsomol's First Secretary, Hranush Hagopian, have been<br>
appointed agriculture minister and social welfare minister, respectively.<br>
Ter-Petrosian and Armen Sarkisian listed the government's priorities as<br>
enforcing law and order, strengthening the army, combating corruption,<br>
channeling domestic commercial capital into production, encouraging foreign<br>
investment, and improving relations with the Armenian diaspora. Sarkisian<br>
described relations with the diaspora as being "in poor shape" following the<br>
presidential election. (Armenpress, Noyan-Tapan, Interfax, November 8-11)<br>
<p>
SOUTH OSSETIA ELECTS A PRESIDENT UNRECOGNIZED BY GEORGIA. South Ossetian<br>
Supreme Soviet chairman Lyudvig Chibirov has won the first-ever presidential<br>
election in the unrecognized republic. Voter turnout was low, and ethnic<br>
Georgians boycotted the election. Chibirov received a narrow but absolute<br>
majority of the votes against five challengers in the first round of<br>
balloting on November 10. The 64-year-old former history professor has<br>
chaired the Supreme Soviet since 1992. <br>
<p>
Chibirov and his supporters advocate a cautious and gradual approach to<br>
unification with the Russian Federation's republic of North Ossetia. Some of<br>
his challengers favored a faster advance toward that goal, which was<br>
approved in South Ossetia's 1991 and 1992 referendums on secession from<br>
Georgia. In a statement reflecting the gradualist approach, the Supreme<br>
Soviet's national policy commission chairman Sergei Kochiev stated yesterday<br>
that "South Ossetia's position remains unchanged: independence, and possible<br>
accession later on to the Russian Federation." Georgian president Eduard<br>
Shevardnadze, in a radio speech yesterday, condemned the election but<br>
stopped short of dramatizing it. He indicated that Tbilisi will continued<br>
negotiations with the existing South Ossetian leadership toward autonomy for<br>
that region within Georgia. (Interfax, November 10-11)<br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
KYRGYZ ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE LOOKING UP. Economic prospects have seemingly<br>
brightened for the small, landlocked nation of Kyrgyzstan. According to<br>
Kyrgyz economics minister Talai Koichumanov, growth in GDP this year could<br>
be a respectable 5 percent. (Interfax, November 11) Data recently released<br>
by the Statistical Committee of the CIS supports this upbeat forecast. In<br>
sharp contrast to gloomy reports coming from a number of other CIS states,<br>
industrial output in Kyrgyzstan through the first nine months of this year<br>
grew by 11.2 percent. (Itar-Tass, November 1) Mining, particularly of gold,<br>
has been an especially impressive performer. Reform of the agricultural<br>
sector, which accounts for 40 percent of Kyrgyzstan's GDP, has also led to<br>
positive results, according to Koichumanov. (Interfax, November 11)<br>
Government policies have also led to a swift reduction in the budget<br>
deficit, which could fall to 5 percent in 1996 from last year's level of 11<br>
percent. Although Kyrgyzstan's national currency, the som, has of late<br>
depreciated sharply against the dollar, authorities have indicated that they<br>
will not support the currency's exchange rate and that the central bank<br>
intends to accumulate foreign currency reserves. According to Koichumanov, a<br>
lower exchange rate is part the country's export strategy. (Interfax, 11<br>
November) <br>
<p>
During a recent meeting in Japan of representatives of Central Asian and<br>
donor countries, Kyrgyzstan was offered $540 million in financial<br>
assistance. (Itar-Tass, November 1) Yesterday, the World Bank announced that<br>
it will open a $15 million credit line for Kyrgyzstan in 1997 to support<br>
privatized enterprises. (UPI, November 11) A special fund will be created to<br>
channel the assistance. Privatization of small enterprises has in general<br>
been a success in Kyrgyzstan, and 546 of 956 medium- and large-scale<br>
enterprises put up for auction this year have also been privatized. But<br>
despite the fact that Kyrgyzstan is rich in gold and other mineral<br>
resources, foreign investment has amounted to only $60 million since the<br>
country gained independence. (UPI, November 11) Improvements in Kyrgyzstan's<br>
infrastructure -- to provide reliable export routes -- are necessary to<br>
attract investors to the country. Moreover, despite its openings to the<br>
West, Kyrgyzstan remains firmly committed to economic integration within the<br>
CIS, and Kyrgyz leaders commonly praise the customs union, in which<br>
Kyrgyzstan is joined by Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia.<br>

70 others attending a memorial service at a Moscow cemetery on November 10.<br>
The blast occurred during a graveside memorial service for Mikhail Likhodei,<br>
chairman of the Afghan War Invalids' Fund, who was himself killed by a bomb<br>
two years ago. Police said gang warfare was the likely cause. Criminal gangs<br>
have muscled in on veterans' associations to exploit the tax breaks such<br>
associations enjoy. (AP, Reuters, Itar-Tass, November 10)<br>

MAJORITY OF RUSSIANS OPPOSE SECESSION. Sixty-two percent of Russians oppose<br>
the idea of giving Russia's regions and republics a constitutional right to<br>
secede from the Federation. In a poll conducted in early November by the<br>
VCIOM polling organization, 20 percent of respondents were in favor and 18<br>
percent were undecided. Those opposed tended to be better educated and in<br>
professional and managerial posts, whereas blue-collar workers and<br>
unemployed people tended to favor the right to secession. (Interfax,<br>
November 10)<br>
<p>
RUSSIA URGES STRONGER EU ROLE IN MIDDLE EAST. Following talks in Moscow with<br>
European Union leaders, Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov on<br>
November 8 called for the EU to play a greater role -- "not only in the<br>
economic sphere but in the political one as well" -- in Middle East peace<br>
negotiations. Primakov added that EU actions in the Middle East should not<br>
conflict with those of either Russia or the U.S. (Interfax, November 8)<br>
Primakov recently returned from an official visit to the region. <br>
<p>
CALL FOR U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN TATUM INVESTIGATION. A congressman from<br>
California has asked the FBI to join the Russian investigation into the<br>
murder of Paul Tatum, a U.S. businessman gunned down on November 3 in<br>
Moscow. (See Monitor, November 4) Republican Chris Cox warned that the Tatum<br>
case might be "swept under the rug" because of the "pervasive" influence of<br>
criminal groups in Moscow's city government. (AP, November 9) Russian<br>
interior minister Anatoly Kulikov has said he would personally supervise the<br>
Tatum investigation. <br>
<p>
SOME MILITARY WAGES PAID. It appears that Russian soldiers, sailors, and<br>
airmen are finally getting paid. Finance Minister Aleksandr Livshits has<br>
announced that military personnel had been paid their October wages and some<br>
of the money owed them for July. August and November wages are still to<br>
come. Deputy Finance Minister Andrei Astakhov said that the government had<br>
paid the full 172 billion rubles in wage arrears owed to the Far Eastern<br>
Military District and the Pacific Fleet. (Itar-Tass, November 9; Reuters<br>
November 10)<br>
<p>
MILITARY COMMANDERS TO DISCUSS REFORM. A conference of the commanders of<br>
Russia's Military Districts and Fleets is to be held in Moscow tomorrow to<br>
discuss the reform of the armed forces. Both the defense minister, Gen. Igor<br>
Rodionov, and the chief of staff, Gen. Viktor Samsonov, will attend. A<br>
Defense Ministry official said that the top commanders would hold a news<br>
conference after the meeting to outline major stages of the reform and troop<br>
reductions. (Itar-Tass, November 10)<br>
<p>
CROATIAN PIPELINE FOR OIL EXPORTS? A project to build an oil pipeline from<br>
the Bulgarian port of Burgas to Alexandroupolis in Greece -- as a way of<br>
ensuring access for Caspian and Central Asian oil to Western markets -- may<br>
be abandoned. Instead, the upgrading of a Croatian pipeline, which connects<br>
to the former Soviet Druzhba pipeline, is being discussed as a cheaper<br>
alternative by Russia's oil minister, the Russian oil company Transneft, and<br>
INA, the Croatian oil company. (Financial Times, November 8)<br>
<p>
GERMAN COMPANY LEAPS INTO UZBEKISTAN. The Salamander company, Germany's<br>
leading producer of medium-priced shoes, has established its second joint<br>
venture in Uzbekistan and is preparing a third. Over the weekend it was<br>
announced that Salamander and Uzbekistan's light industry ministry have<br>
founded a factory in Chirchik, Tashkent region. It will have an annual<br>
production capacity of 330,000 pairs of children's shoes. The partners'<br>
first venture, launched less than one year ago, is located in Ferghana. The<br>
third is due to be established soon in Kokand. (Interfax, November 10)<br>

LEBED SLIPPING, BUT STILL AHEAD IN POPULARITY POLLS. Aleksandr Lebed still<br>
tops the polls as the politician most trusted by Russian citizens, despite<br>
the fact that his popularity has fallen since he struck up his much<br>
publicized alliance with former presidential bodyguard Aleksandr Korzhakov.<br>
At the beginning of September, just after Lebed signed the Chechen ceasefire<br>
agreements, 62 percent of Russians identified the then Security Council<br>
secretary as the politician they trusted most. In a poll carried out at the<br>
end of October, Lebed's rating had fallen to 44 percent. Nonetheless, he was<br>
still ahead of the competition. Lebed's closest rival in October was Gennady<br>
Zyuganov, trusted by 29 percent, followed by Prime Minister Viktor<br>
Chernomyrdin with 21 percent, President Boris Yeltsin with 17 percent, newly<br>
appointed Security Council Secretary Ivan Rybkin with 11 percent, and<br>
Presidential Chief of Staff Anatoly Chubais with 8 percent. Lebed also<br>
scored the lowest levels of distrust: in September, 13 percent of Russians<br>
said they distrusted him. And while in October this figure had climbed to 24<br>
percent, Lebed remained ahead of the competition. In October, 63 percent<br>
said they distrusted Chubais, followed by 60 percent for Yeltsin, 47 percent<br>
for Zyuganov, 46 percent for Chernomyrdin, and 41 percent for Rybkin.<br>

MIXED REACTION TO YELTSIN'S OLIVE BRANCH. President Boris Yeltsin's<br>
declaration that November 7 is henceforth to be celebrated in Russia as the<br>
Day of Reconciliation and Accord got a mixed reception in Moscow political<br>
circles. Pro-government figures greeted the move enthusiastically but<br>
opposition figures were less keen. Agrarian party leader Vasili<br>
Starodubtsev, who was briefly jailed in 1991 for his role in the coup that<br>
toppled Mikhail Gorbachev, strongly objected to Yeltsin's attempt to abolish<br>
the memory of the October Revolution. "Robbers can't make peace with those<br>
they rob," he declared, "and it won't be possible to bury this date."<br>
(Interfax, November 8) Radical Communist leader Viktor Tyulkin predicted<br>
that Yeltsin's initiative would go the same way as the president's 1994 Pact<br>
of National Accord, which the Communist party refused to sign and which<br>
everybody forgot about long ago. (Interfax, November 8) Others saw the move<br>
as a cynical attempt to embarrass the Communist party. Yeltsin invited<br>
Communist Party leaders to join a new committee headed by Prime Minister<br>
Chernomyrdin that will mark next year's 80th anniversary of the 1917<br>
Revolution by organizing events and erecting monuments to the victims of<br>
communism. The Communists can hardly agree to take part but, if they refuse<br>
to join in, they will be accused to rejecting Yeltsin's offer of cooperation<br>
and reconciliation. (Reuters, November 8)<br>
<p>
COMMUNIST CANDIDATE WINS REGIONAL ELECTION. A Communist-backed candidate has<br>
won the gubernatorial election in Kaluga oblast, south of Moscow. The<br>
Communist victory means that opposition candidates have now won more of this<br>
fall's series of regional governorships than they have lost. In the run-off<br>
held in Kaluga over the weekend, the 56-year-old Communist-backed candidate,<br>
Valeri Sudarenkov, won 63.5 percent of the vote. He defeated the<br>
Kremlin-backed incumbent, 48-year-old Oleg Savchenko, who was put in the<br>
post by President Yeltsin only six months ago. Sudarenkov is a former<br>
apparatchik who made his career in the Communist party organization in<br>
Kaluga oblast and spent several years as deputy prime minister in Soviet<br>
Uzbekistan. <br>
<p>
Kaluga suffers from high unemployment and that, together with wages and<br>
pensions arrears, is seen as having lead to Savchenko's defeat. (Interfax,<br>
November 10). Sudarenkov's victory did not, however, appear to faze the<br>
deputy head of Yeltsin's presidential administration, Aleksandr Kazakov, who<br>
told journalists that Sudarenkov is a professional with whom the Kremlin<br>
could do business. (ORT, November 10) Meanwhile, another opposition leader,<br>
former vice president Aleksandr Rutskoi, has been sworn in as governor of<br>
Kursk oblast. (NTV, November 10) Rutskoi made history by becoming the first<br>
Russian regional governor since the October Revolution to take his oath of<br>
office in church.<br>
<p>
RUSSIA TO ISSUE DEBUT EUROBONDS WORTH $500 MILLION. Russia's first eurobond<br>
issue will be launched between November 21 and 25 and will be worth about<br>
$500 million, according to Russia's finance minister. (Interfax, November 9)<br>
Aleksandr Livshits said the government plans to make a small and cautious<br>
initial issue and to follow it up with a second issue in 1997. Officials<br>
from the Russian Finance Ministry, J.P. Morgan and SBC Warburg, who are<br>
handling the issue, will hold a series of presentations to investors between<br>
November 11 and 20 in Luxembourg, Geneva, Zurich, Paris, London, Frankfurt,<br>
Singapore, Seoul, Tokyo and Hong Kong. It is hoped in Moscow that by<br>
increasing the share of foreign financing of Russia's budget deficit and<br>
reducing sales of Treasury bills in the domestic market, the cost of<br>
domestic debt servicing, which is being pushed up by the high yields of<br>
state securities, will fall.<br>
<p>
Livshits also said that federal tax collection rates improved in the second<br>
half of October, after reaching an all-time low in September, and that the<br>
chances are good that the IMF will agree to issue the November tranche of<br>
its budget support loan to Russia. Last month, the IMF withheld payment,<br>
telling the government that it must first improve its tax collection rates.<br>
(Itar-Tass, November 10)<br>
<p>
According to Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Davydov, agreements with the London<br>
and Paris clubs paved the way for the entry of Russia into the world<br>
financial markets. (Interfax, November 8) Another step in this direction<br>
took place last month, when Russia received its credit ratings from leading<br>
European and American rating agencies. Credit ratings reflect perceived risk<br>
of default by a borrower and influence its funding costs. The ratings given<br>
put Russia in the same league as Romania and Lithuania, but fell short of<br>
the investment grades granted to Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Poland,<br>
Slovakia and Hungary. (Financial Times, November 6)<br>
<p>
MOSCOW AGAIN DEMANDS RELEASE OF FORMER SPY. Russia's Foreign Intelligence<br>
Service (SVR) warned again yesterday that it would retaliate if the U.S.<br>
refuses to release Vladimir Galkin, a former Soviet intelligence officer<br>
arrested in New York on October 29. While not specifying what actions the<br>
Russian agency might take, spokeswoman Tatyana Samolis said that "we don't<br>
intend to leave Vladimir Galkin to the mercy of fate. Our patience is not<br>
unlimited and an appropriate response will not be long in coming." Her<br>
remarks followed what Samolis said was a meeting in the U.S. between<br>
representatives of the SVR and the FBI.<br>
<p>
Following Galkin's arrest two weeks ago SVR officials suggested that Moscow<br>
might arrest former U.S. intelligence personnel currently visiting Russia.<br>
In an article published in a Russian newspaper yesterday, a former<br>
top-ranking KGB officer pointed to former CIA officials now doing research<br>
in Russian archives as possible targets for retaliation. Like the SVR<br>
officials earlier, he argued that in arresting Galkin the U.S. had violated<br>
an unwritten agreement between espionage agencies in the two countries not<br>
to harass retired intelligence personnel. The FBI has accused Galkin of<br>
attempting to procure classified documents on the U.S. Strategic Defense<br>
Initiative. That incident reportedly occurred in Cyprus in 1991. (Reuter,<br>
Itar-Tass, November 10. See also Monitor, November 6)<br>
<p>
IRAQI FOREIGN MINISTER IN MOSCOW. Following talks with his Iraqi counterpart<br>
in Moscow yesterday, Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov called for<br>
quick implementation of the UN's 1995 "oil-for-food" resolution. The plan<br>
provides for a partial lifting of sanctions against Iraq by allowing it to<br>
sell $2 billion worth of oil in order to buy food-stuffs and medicines for<br>
Iraq's civilian population. Negotiations on implementation of the resolution<br>
were put on hold following Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's dispatch of troops<br>
to northern Iraq late this summer. The U.S., along with Britain, has<br>
generally taken a harder line on the partial lifting of sanctions, while<br>
Moscow has received some backing from France and China in its efforts both<br>
to advance the oil-for-food deal and, ultimately, to win a complete lifting<br>
of UN sanctions on Iraq. Russia has recently concluded billions of dollars<br>
worth of deals with Baghdad, particularly in the energy sector, but they can<br>
be launched only after sanctions on Iraq are lifted. (Reuter, November 8;<br>
Reuter, Itar-Tass, November 10)<br>
<p>
MOSCOW'S MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT HELPING GROZNY BACK ON ITS FEET. The<br>
indefatigable mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, has tasked his city planners<br>
with helping restore communal services to the quarter million inhabitants of<br>
Chechnya's war-devastated capital. Electricity supplies are being restored<br>
and street lighting turned back on. Luzhkov has promised flour, sugar, and<br>
oil from Moscow's reserves. As winter approaches, heating has become an<br>
urgent problem in Grozny, and Moscow plans to supply 30,000 paraffin<br>
heaters. Ensuring supplies of fresh water is harder; sewage-disposal is the<br>
most difficult problem of all and is provoking fears of epidemics. Other<br>
urgent needs are burial services and refuse-collection. (Interfax, November 9)<br>
<p>
RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL MISSING FROM CHECHNYA? Some 450 cubic meters of<br>
radioactive nuclear material is missing from a storage site in Chechnya,<br>
according to a report in the Sunday Times said to be based on official<br>
Russian documents. The paper disclosed that the material had been stored at<br>
the Radon factory near the village of Tolstoy-Yurt, north of Grozny. It<br>
included weapons-grade uranium-235 and plutonium as well as quantities of<br>
cesium-137 and strontium-90. When the war began in November, 1994 there were<br>
some 900 cubic meters of material in the plant's storage site, with a<br>
combined radioactivity level of 1,500 curies. <br>
<p>
The paper said that one of the documents was from Prime Minister Viktor<br>
Chernomyrdin's office and was dated March of this year. That document<br>
admitted to the "disappearance and unsanctioned removal of radioactive<br>
materials" from the Radon plant. The article inferred that the material was<br>
most likely in the form of diluted nuclear waste rather than in the<br>
concentrated form that would be necessary if it were to be used in an atomic<br>
weapon. Nevertheless, Noble Prize winning nuclear physicist Joseph Rotblat<br>
noted that the material "could be very dangerous to ingest or inhale. Even<br>
very small amounts can cause cancer." (Sunday Times, November 10)<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
BUSY WEEKEND FOR WESTERN OILMEN IN AZERBAIJAN. Managers of the French oil<br>
company Elf-Aquitaine and the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan (SOCAR)<br>
conferred in Baku over the weekend, finalizing a contract to develop the<br>
Lenkoran-Deniz oil field on Azerbaijan's Caspian shelf. The field's<br>
estimated reserves are 50 to 60 million tons. The final production-sharing<br>
contract is due to be signed during Aliev's upcoming official visit to<br>
France. Elf-Aquitaine is already active in Azerbaijan as part of the<br>
consortium that recently signed a contract to develop the Shah-Deniz oil and<br>
gas fields. (International Petroleum Agency, Turan, UPI, November 11)<br>
<p>
In parallel talks, SOCAR and representatives of an international consortium<br>
reached agreement on a project to develop the offshore Dan-Ulduzu and<br>
Ashrafi oil and gas fields. Their aggregate reserves are estimated at 100 to<br>
120 million tons of oil and 30 to 50 billion cubic meters of gas, to be<br>
extracted over a 25 to 30 year period. The U.S. company AMOCO will have a 30<br>
percent stake in the project, as will, in combination, the allied UNOCAL of<br>
California and Saudi Arabia's Delta. Japan's Itochu and SOCAR each have a 20<br>
percent stake. SOCAR's is to be financed by the consortium partners. Aliev<br>
is now due to schedule the signing of the final contract. (International<br>
Petroleum Agency, November 10)<br>

UKRAINE: TOWARD A SPECIAL PARTNERSHIP WITH NATO... Gen. <br>
Klaus Naumann, chairman of NATO's Military Committee, <br>
conferred with Ukrainian leaders during a three-day <br>
visit. Talks focused on developing a NATO-Ukraine <br>
"special partnership," which was described as <br>
paralleling, but not rivaling, NATO's evolving relations <br>
with Russia. Naumann also renewed assurances that NATO <br>
does not plan to station nuclear weapons in countries <br>
that will join the alliance. NATO will open an <br>
information center in Kiev. (UNIAN, November 4-6)<br>
<p>
...AND WITH THE U.S. In Washington, the U.S.-Ukrainian <br>
Foreign Policy Committee held its inaugural session. It <br>
is co-chaired by U.S. ambassador-at-large for the newly <br>
independent states, James Collins, and Ukrainian deputy <br>
foreign minister Anton Butenko. A joint statement <br>
described the Committee as a "valuable mechanism for <br>
constructing a U.S.-Ukraine strategic partnership based <br>
on common values and goals." The committee is one of four <br>
under the recently established U.S.-Ukrainian <br>
intergovernmental commission. (UNIAN, November 6)<br>
<p>
WARSAW: RUSSIA COULD ANNOUNCE OSCE INITIATIVE. Poland's <br>
foreign minister told reporters in Warsaw yesterday that <br>
he expects Moscow to unveil an alternative to NATO <br>
enlargement at the December OSCE summit in Lisbon. Darius <br>
Rosati said that he did not know precisely what the <br>
Russian proposal would contain, but he expected it would <br>
be a plan for a broad European security system that would <br>
give pride of place to the OSCE rather than to NATO. <br>
(Reuter, November 7)<br>
<p>
BELLONA PLEADS FOR NIKITIN'S FREEDOM. The Norwegian <br>
environmental group Bellona yesterday urged the European <br>
Parliament to pressure Russian authorities for the <br>
release of Aleksandr Nikitin, a retired Russian naval <br>
officer charged with treason. Nikitin has been in prison <br>
since February for allegedly leaking state secrets on <br>
environmental threats posed by Russia's Northern Fleet. <br>
Bellona said the arrest sets a dangerous precedent, both <br>
in terms both of human rights and environmental <br>
protection. (Reuter, November 6)<br>
<p>
RUSSIA'S MILITARY DOCTRINE EXAMINED. Russia's recently <br>
constituted Defense Council met on November 4 to discuss <br>
revisions in the nation's military doctrine. According to <br>
council secretary Yury Baturin, changes in Russia's <br>
geopolitical situation prompted the discussions. He <br>
singled out NATO enlargement and what he described as the <br>
efforts of outside states to limit Russia's influence in <br>
Central Asia and the Caucasus regions. Baturin suggested <br>
that the latter development was aimed at impeding <br>
Russia's integration with these regions. (Russian TV, <br>
November 4)<br>
<p>
GEORGIA'S NAVY CHIEF RESIGNS. Rear-Adm. Aleksandr <br>
Dzhavakhishvili has resigned as commander of the Georgian <br>
navy because of "a serious disagreement" with the <br>
country's defense minister. The 64-year-old admiral had <br>
been the only chief of independent Georgia's navy. <br>
Previously he had served in the Soviet navy as a <br>
submariner in the Pacific Fleet, rising to the rank of <br>
rear admiral. (Sakinform, November 6)<br>

SURELY NO SHORTAGE OF APPLICANTS FOR THESE JOBS. As part <br>
of its campaign to increase revenue collection, the <br>
Russian government plans to deploy tax inspectors round-<br>
the-clock in liquor distilleries. Their job will be to <br>
ensure that plants do not sell alcohol on the side <br>
without paying the appropriate tax. (Interfax, November <br>

RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
YELTSIN: "I'M BACK AT WORK." Russian president Boris <br>
Yeltsin this morning left the heart clinic where he had <br>
heart bypass surgery on November 5 and moved back to <br>
Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital to continue his <br>
convalescence. Yeltsin knows the hospital well and is <br>
said to be more comfortable there than in the clinic. His <br>
doctors say that he is in some pain but is continuing to <br>
make strong progress and has already started to work on <br>
state documents. "I am happy to inform you that the <br>
operation was successful. I have returned to work," <br>
Yeltsin said in a statement distributed by his office <br>
yesterday. (AP, Itar-Tass, November 7; BBC, November 8) <br>
<p>
The Russian heart surgeon who operated on Yeltsin, Renat <br>
Akchurin, says the president is recovering so quickly <br>
that he could be back at work in two weeks. (NTV, <br>
November 7) American cardiologist Michael DeBakey <br>
predicted Yeltsin would be "a new man." He said that the <br>
president would have to eat and drink in moderation for <br>
the rest of his life, but added that he had seen no <br>
medical evidence that Yeltsin was an alcoholic. (Reuter, <br>
November 7)<br>
<p>
YELTSIN CALLS FOR UNITY, RENAMES COMMUNIST HOLIDAY. Keen <br>
to show he is back in control, Yeltsin yesterday issued a <br>
written appeal to the nation, saying that Russia is still <br>
scarred by divisions and calling for unity. "We are one <br>
nation. We have one fate, one future. And we are all from <br>
the same past. This day should unite and not divide the <br>
people," Yeltsin said. He signed a decree declaring that <br>
November 7 will in the future be known as the Day of <br>
Accord and Reconciliation, and be celebrated as a day of <br>
remembrance for the victims of revolution and repression. <br>
Until now, it has been known as Revolution Day and has <br>
celebrated the anniversary of the Bolshevik seizure of <br>
power in 1917. Yeltsin also ordered the eventual removal <br>
of Communist-era symbols nationwide and their replacement <br>
by monuments to the victims of the Soviet state. <br>
<p>
Meanwhile, out on the streets of Moscow yesterday, 20,000 <br>
protesters were waving red flags and singing Soviet-era <br>
songs to demonstrate their disgust with Yeltsin's market <br>
reforms. Yeltsin's call for unity is unlikely to <br>
reconcile these people and millions of other Russians to <br>
the fact that their wages and pensions are months <br>
overdue. In fact, the main purpose of Yeltsin's decree <br>
seemed to be to show that Yeltsin is recovering rapidly <br>
and reasserting his authority after a four-month power <br>
vacuum during which top aides have squabbled openly. <br>
(Itar-Tass, Reuters, November 7)<br>
<p>
BEREZOVSKY BACK IN NORTH CAUCASUS; ROW BREWING OVER DUAL <br>
CITIZENSHIP. Boris Berezovsky, the former banker whose <br>
appointment to Russia's Security Council created an <br>
uproar last month, is back in the Ingush capital Nazran <br>
today for meetings with Chechen deputy prime minister <br>
Movladi Udugov. (Interfax, November 7) No details were <br>
released, but it is believed that the talks will center <br>
on the Russian government's plans to declare all of <br>
Chechnya a free economic zone. A draft federal law on <br>
this topic is to be placed before the Russian parliament <br>
next week. According to Deputy Duma Speaker Mikhail <br>
Gutseryev, who has been involved in discussions of the <br>
draft, the aim is to facilitate the rebuilding of <br>
Chechnya's war-torn economy without drawing on Russia's <br>
cash-strapped federal budget. This sentiment was echoed <br>
by First Deputy Speaker Aleksandr Shokhin, who predicted <br>
that the bill will have a smooth passage through the <br>
Duma. He said there would be no objection to the fact <br>
that the bill would absolve Chechnya from paying federal <br>
taxes. Chechnya has not paid any federal taxes for at <br>
least five years, he pointed out, and it would therefore <br>
be "no disaster" if the situation was regularized to <br>
allow the Chechen people to restore their economy <br>
themselves, without depending on funds from Russia. <br>

<p>
The row over rumors that Berezovsky holds both Russian <br>
and Israeli citizenship seems set to deepen following a <br>
report that Israel's Ministry of Absorption has confirmed <br>
that Berezovsky was granted Israeli citizenship when he <br>
and his family emigrated to Israel in November 1993. The <br>
family left Israel four months later without, apparently, <br>
renouncing their Israeli citizenship. (Jerusalem Post, <br>
November 6) Russian law on citizenship, which is still in <br>
the process of evolution, permits dual citizenship and is <br>
vague on whether or not it should disqualify an <br>
individual from holding state office. But Russia's <br>
extreme right-wing groups and newspapers, which have a <br>
strong anti-Semitic tinge, are sure to use the report to <br>
fuel their propaganda against the Yeltsin government as a <br>
whole. <br>
<p>
TROUBLES WITH MONEY, ROCKETS, AND TOILETS PLAGUE RUSSIAN <br>
SPACE PROGRAM. It was disclosed yesterday that the <br>
scheduled December 15 launch of a replacement crew for <br>
the Mir space station has been delayed until February. <br>
The previous crew change also had to be delayed for the <br>
same reasons: not enough money to pay for the <br>
construction of the Soyuz booster rockets used to launch <br>
the space vehicles that resupply the station. The <br>
workhorse of the manned program, the Soyuz rockets <br>
themselves have had problems this year, with several <br>
spectacular failures. However, more than 770 launches of <br>
the 5 variants of the Soyuz -- first introduced in 1966 -<br>
- have been conducted over the years, with a success rate <br>
of over 97%. <br>
<p>
The two cosmonauts and one American astronaut currently <br>
on Mir have a more immediate problem: the device that <br>
recycles their waste into the station's cooling system <br>
has broken, and the waste containers are nearly full. New <br>
containers were to have been delivered in October, but <br>
that launch has been delayed until later this month. <br>
(Reuters, November 7) The crew members aboard Mir have <br>
probably offered to pay for this launch themselves. <br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIAN BATTALION TAKING SHAPE. At a three-day <br>
meeting in Bishkek, which ended yesterday, Defense <br>
Ministry officials from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and <br>
Uzbekistan reviewed progress in creating a Central Asian <br>
peacekeeping battalion. It is to be comprised of troops <br>
from these three countries and earmarked for UN-sponsored <br>
operations. The meeting adopted a detailed plan for <br>
organizing the battalion's first-ever field exercise, <br>
scheduled for next year as part of NATO's Partnership for <br>
Peace program. The two-stage exercise, to be held at <br>
Kazakh and Uzbek military bases, will be supervised by <br>
Russian, U.S., and Turkish officers at battalion level, <br>
and by Danish, Ukrainian, and Baltic officers at company <br>
level. Military representatives from most of these <br>
countries attended the Bishkek meeting. (Interfax, <br>
November 7)<br>
<p>
The battalion was formed last spring pursuant to a <br>
decision by the three presidents. Tajikistan was not <br>
invited, and Turkmenistan, citing its neutral status, <br>
declined to join. Turkmenistan's neutrality also <br>
precludes it from participating in CIS military <br>
activities. Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan have <br>
token and essentially inactive units in the rear echelon <br>
of nominally CIS peacekeeping troops in Tajikistan. The <br>
creation of the Central Asian battalion, linked directly <br>
to the UN and NATO's PfP, is meant to reduce Russia's <br>
role in regional security, and symbolizes a new era for <br>
Central Asia. The distribution of roles in the <br>
international supervision of next year's military <br>
exercise does reflect an intent to keep Russia in the <br>
game, but safely flanked by countries interested in <br>
promoting Eurasian geopolitical pluralism. <br>
<p>
TAJIK OPPOSITION LEADER REAFFIRMS TERMS FOR NEGOTIATED <br>
SETTLEMENT. United Tajik Opposition first deputy chairman <br>
Akbar Turajonzoda told The Monitor by telephone that the <br>
UTO persists in seeking negotiations toward a power-<br>
sharing agreement with the Dushanbe government. "That's <br>
how it is in all countries after a civil war. In Angola <br>
for example, or Cambodia. The Tajik authorities keep <br>
referring to the constitution, which they adopted without <br>
the participation of our supporters. We get the <br>
impression that Rahmonov still isn't ready for a meeting <br>
with [UTO chairman] Saidabdullo Nuri," Turajonzoda told <br>
The Monitor. He stressed that, despite its recent <br>
military successes (See Monitor, October 28 and November <br>
5), the opposition will not pursue outright victory. <br>
"That would lead to a lot of bloodshed, and to an open <br>
confrontation with Russian troops. We will stick to <br>
guerrilla tactics -- strike a blow, then vanish. Our main <br>
goal is to persuade Moscow once and for all to stop <br>
supporting the Rahmonov regime." Reacting to UN envoy <br>
Hans-Dietrich Merrem's recent accusations that the UTO <br>
was violating the ceasefire, Turajonzoda pointed out that <br>
the opposition was being "forced to respond to the <br>
government troops' operations."<br>
<p>
Nuri has recently confirmed the known position that he is <br>
willing to hold talks with Rahmonov in Moscow if the <br>
subject is the formation of transitional power bodies, <br>
including a national council and a coalition government, <br>
pending preparations for internationally-supervised free <br>
elections. Moscow, with the UN envoy's support, insists <br>
on holding such a meeting in the Russian capital under <br>
Russian arbitration, but supports Dushanbe's insistence <br>
on observance of existing constitutional arrangements <br>
imposed after the 1992 civil war.<br>
<p>
INTERNATIONAL BANKERS MIGHT BET ON MORIBUND TAJIK HORSE. <br>
At a conference in Tokyo last week, World Bank and donor <br>
countries' representatives agreed to lend Tajikistan $185 <br>
million in 1997 and to consider additional credits in <br>
order to "maintain stability and sustain economic <br>
reforms." Tied to an IMF-approved reform program, the <br>
funds will be used primarily for balance-of-payments <br>
support and budget balancing, technical credits, building <br>
or overhauling railways and highways, and constructing <br>
international airports in Dushanbe, Hojent, and Kulyab. <br>
Tajik prime minister Yahie Azimov pledged to the Tokyo <br>
conferees that the Tajik government will reform the <br>
economy and "build a law-based democratic state." (Itar-<br>
Tass, October 31, November 1)<br>
<p>
The aftermath of the Tokyo meeting has witnessed the <br>
following developments, quite apart from the government's <br>
latest military defeats: <br>
<p>
The Tajik government is offering dollar salaries to <br>
Russian officers in Russia willing to take up senior <br>
posts in Tajikistan's army, a recruitment that is <br>
proceeding apart from the Russian "peacekeepers" already <br>
deployed there. Dushanbe's offers are being publicized in <br>
the Russian military press. Tajikistan is the first CIS <br>
country to invite Russian officers to assume posts in its <br>
own army. (Soldat Otechestva  [newspaper of the Volga <br>
military district], October 26)<br>
<p>
In an unusual expose, official Tajik radio confirmed that <br>
military and security authorities are in effect <br>
kidnapping young Tajiks to induct them into the army and <br>
send them to fight in the civil war -- a circumstance <br>
which has contributed to the army's abysmal morale. The <br>
radio deplored the "press-ganging system." (Radio <br>
Dushanbe, November 4)<br>
<p>
The British firm Gold and Mineral Excavation, which has a <br>
gold-mining partnership with the Tajik government, <br>
suspended its operations. The British firm cited military <br>
operations that are drawing closer to the mining area and <br>
a drastic decline in production. The previous week, a <br>
Canadian company, Nelson Gold, had also withdrawn from a <br>
joint gold-mining venture. It cited nonfulfillment of <br>
contractual obligations by the Tajik government. (See <br>
Monitor, October 31)<br>
<p>
Tajik president Imomali Rahmonov has appointed or <br>
reappointed members of his own Kulyab clan to head the <br>
repressive ministries: Homiddin Sharipov as Internal <br>
Affairs minister and Saidamir Zuhorov as state security <br>
minister. (Radio Dushanbe, Itar-Tass, October 31, <br>
November 1) The heavy predominance of the small Kulyab <br>
clan in government and in economic administration -- and <br>
the resulting graft accruing to the clan -- is one of the <br>
main sources of political instability in Tajikistan. In a <br>
long- overdue opening to another clan, Rahmonov this week <br>
offered top economic posts to two former prime ministers <br>
hailing from Leninabad region but currently residing in <br>
Moscow. The Leninabad region supplied most of <br>
Tajikistan's Soviet-era nomenklatura, and Rahmonov in <br>
fact cited the two ex-premiers' alleged economic <br>
experience and capacity to promote reforms in offering to <br>
coopt them. (Itar-Tass, Interfax, November 5 through 7) <br>
Rahmonov's native Kulyab area would be favored with its <br>
own airport under the program just approved by the <br>
international bankers' meeting.<br>

NEWS:<br>
<p>
YELTSIN MAKING GOOD PROGRESS. Doctors treating Russian <br>
president Boris Yeltsin say he is making "surprisingly <br>
good" progress, but have advised him to stay for an <br>
additional 24 hours in the clinic where he underwent <br>
surgery on November 5. Yeltsin, who is already up and <br>
walking, had asked to be moved. American cardiologist <br>
Michael DeBakey said that, if Yeltsin continues at this <br>
rate, he could be back at work in 6-8 weeks and playing <br>
tennis in four months. (Interfax, November 6; Itar-Tass, <br>
BBC World Service, November 7)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FOOD SUPPLY: NO PROBLEMS FORESEEN. Russia's <br>
deputy agriculture minister has dismissed media <br>
allegations that Russia intends to purchase large <br>
quantities of food abroad. The deputy minister said that <br>
grain harvested this year exceeds last year's level by 8 <br>
percent, and that no supply problems are foreseen with <br>
regard to other major crops. Purchases from abroad will <br>
be made when transports costs make them cheaper than <br>
domestic ones, he concluded. (Itar-Tass, November 6)<br>
<p>
DEFENSE SPENDING TO RISE? Forecasts by Russia's Ministry <br>
of Economics indicate that defense spending in Russia <br>
could rise from its current level of 3.7 percent of GDP <br>
to as much as 5.5 percent by the year 2000. That forecast <br>
is reportedly predicated upon the ability of the <br>
government to collect sufficient tax revenues. The <br>
additional defense expenditures would go first to the <br>
defense research and development sector and to <br>
manufacturers of military hardware. (Nezavisimaya gazeta, <br>
November 6)<br>
<p>
GENERAL STAFF SLAMS DEFENSE REDUCTION PLANS. Russia's <br>
recently named General Staff chief has indirectly <br>
criticized Defense Ministry plans to reduce Russia's army <br>
to 1.2 million soldiers before 1998. Gen. Viktor Samsonov <br>
said on November 1 that the General Staff prefers to <br>
maintain the army at 1.5 million. (Interfax, November 1) <br>
The nominal strength of Russia's military is now 1.7 <br>
million. Opposition from the General Staff could <br>
complicate already unpopular efforts to transform the <br>
army into a leaner, less expensive fighting force. <br>
<p>
RUSSIA SIGNS AFRICAN NUCLEAR FREE ZONE TREATY. In Addis <br>
Ababa yesterday the Russian Ambassador signed the <br>
Pelindaba Treaty establishing an African Nuclear Weapons <br>
Free Zone. Russia was the last of the 5 declared nuclear <br>
powers to sign. Russia had balked at the treaty when it <br>
opened for signature in June, expressing concern about <br>
the British Indian Ocean protectorate of Diego Garcia, <br>
used as a base for American B-52 nuclear capable bombers. <br>
(Xinhua, November 5)<br>
<p>
PRINCE CHARLES IN UKRAINE. The Prince of Wales yesterday <br>
completed a three-day visit to Ukraine at the invitation <br>
of President Leonid Kuchma. The heir to the British <br>
throne met with Kuchma and other Ukrainian officials in <br>
Kiev and with Ukrainian military commanders in <br>
Sevastopol. He visited battlefields of the Crimean War <br>
(1853-56) in which Britain, France, and other European <br>
powers fought Russia. (UNIAN, November 4 through 6)<br>
<p>
UKRAINE, GEORGIA "FULLY CONCUR" IN FOREIGN POLICY. In a <br>
joint communique released yesterday, Ukraine and Georgia <br>
recorded the "full concurrence of their interests, <br>
positions, and assessments regarding the key problems of <br>
international relations and cooperation within the CIS." <br>
(Interfax-Ukraine, November 6) The communique capped <br>
Ukrainian prime minister Pavlo Lazarenko's three-day <br>
visit and talks with President Eduard Shevardnadze, which <br>
produced economic and military agreements amid an <br>
accelerating rapprochement between the two countries. <br>
(See Monitor, November 6)<br>
<p>
GEORGIA SPECIFIES CLAIM TO BLACK SEA FLEET SHARE. <br>
Georgia's naval commander, Rear Adm. Aleksandr <br>
Javahishvili, yesterday spelled out what Georgia claims <br>
"for the moment" as its share of the ex-Soviet Black Sea <br>
Fleet. Georgia needs several minesweepers, small missile <br>
cutters, and some auxiliary vessels, the admiral said in <br>
Poti, where his Ukrainian counterpart Mikhailo Yezhel is <br>
visiting. (Interfax-Ukraine, November 6) Ukraine and <br>
Georgia support each other's position vis-a-vis Russia <br>
concerning the partition of the Black Sea Fleet. <br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN-U.S. RELATIONS AFTER THE ELECTION. Russian <br>
political leaders spoke in generally positive terms <br>
yesterday of U.S. president Bill Clinton's reelection, <br>
but their preference for dealing with a known quantity <br>
was balanced by a recognition that the two countries face <br>
a host of potentially divisive issues. One unnamed senior <br>
diplomat described Clinton and Russian president Boris <br>
Yeltsin as "seasoned politicians" whose "warm personal <br>
ties" offered hope that "problems will be solved in a <br>
spirit of partnership." (Reuter, November 6) But <br>
Aleksandr Shokhin, deputy Duma speaker and a member of <br>
the government's "Russia is Our Home" faction, suggested <br>
that the November 5 election results could propel <br>
Washington to adopt a harsher position toward Russia. <br>
Shokhin pointed in part to the fact that Republicans had <br>
retained control of the U.S. Congress in arguing that <br>
"the imperial ambitions of the US could rise to a new <br>
level," and that Clinton's second term might be marked by <br>
a redoubled U.S. effort to dominate the world. (Interfax, <br>
November 6)<br>
<p>
Moscow is undoubtedly watching with some interest to see <br>
who will be tipped to fill top foreign policy and <br>
security posts in what is expected to be a major <br>
reshuffling of the Clinton cabinet. Secretary of State <br>
Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary William Perry -- <br>
each of whom devoted considerable energy to cultivating <br>
friendly relations with Moscow -- have reportedly decided <br>
to leave their posts. (AP, November 6) Some U.S. <br>
observers believe that Deputy Secretary of State Strobe <br>
Talbott, the primary architect of the Clinton <br>
Administration's Russia policy to date, could emerge in a <br>
more influential position in the administration's second <br>
term. Talbott has long been accused by critics of being <br>
overly sympathetic toward Moscow. But during a recent <br>
speech in New York he expressed doubts about the ultimate <br>
success of democratization in Russia and accused Moscow's <br>
"foreign policy elite" of clinging to old stereotypes and <br>
deliberately misinterpreting U.S. policy as an effort to <br>
weaken and divide Russia. Talbott also cautioned Russians <br>
against "defining their security at the expense of <br>
everyone else's and misdefining security itself as the <br>
expensive and wasteful capacity to destroy and <br>
intimidate." (USIA, October 29) Talbott's remarks, coming <br>
as Washington and Moscow move to resolve their <br>
differences over NATO enlargement and a number of other <br>
contentious issues, were a reminder that the reelections <br>
this year of Yeltsin and Clinton provide no guarantee <br>
that currently rocky relations will improve. <br>
<p>
MOSCOW MARKS TWO VERY DIFFERENT ANNIVERSARIES. Today and <br>
tomorrow are public holidays in Russia, traditionally <br>
held to mark the anniversary of the 1917 Bolshevik <br>
Revolution. In Moscow this morning, Communist party <br>
leader Gennady Zyuganov addressed a crowd of around 5,000 <br>
demonstrators, waving red flags and singing Soviet-era <br>
songs. A BBC correspondent reporting from the scene noted <br>
that the numbers of those attending this annual <br>
demonstration are decreasing year by year. (BBC World <br>
Service, November 7) At a ceremony marking the <br>
anniversary yesterday, Zyuganov said only mass protests <br>
and the formation of a new government could prevent <br>
Russia from plunging into chaos and fratricidal strife. <br>
<p>
Meanwhile, some of those Zyuganov blames for this <br>
situation held an informal celebration to mark the fifth <br>
anniversary of the formation of the government that <br>
launched Russia's market reforms. Those present included <br>
Yegor Gaidar, Anatoly Chubais, Gennady Burbulis, Andrei <br>
Kozyrev, Aleksandr Shokhin, Mikhail Poltoranin, and Ella <br>
Pamfilova. Summing up the achievements of the government <br>
he headed, Gaidar said its main task was to create the <br>
mechanisms of the market while avoiding famine. But he <br>
said his government had not managed to do many things <br>
that still remain undone today. Gaidar gave due praise to <br>
Yeltsin who, he said, grasped in autumn 1991 that "the <br>
time had come to act." (Interfax, November 6)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT INTERVENES IN DE BEERS NEGOTIATIONS. <br>
The Russian government has placed a temporary hold on the <br>
negotiations between South Africa's De Beers Corporation <br>
and Russia's Almazy Rossii-Sakha diamond company (ARS) <br>
over the sale of Russia's export diamonds. (Itar-Tass, <br>
AP, November 5) Under a draft deal negotiated with De <br>
Beers last month, ARS would sell a minimum of 85 percent <br>
of its production through the Central Selling <br>
Organization, the cartel controlled by De Beers. But now <br>
the Russian government's emergency tax commission says it <br>
wants to audit the negotiations and claims to have <br>
discovered tax fraud and violations of currency <br>
regulations by ARS. The company, which mines about 96 <br>
percent of Russia's diamonds, is state-owned but largely <br>
controlled by local authorities in the autonomy-minded <br>
Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) in north-eastern Russia. <br>
There are suspicions that the cash-strapped Russian <br>
government would like to reassert central control over <br>
the company, seeing it as a handy source of revenue, and <br>
may resume negotiations with De Beers itself.<br>
<p>
"ENTREPRENEURS, UNITE!" Mikhail Khodorkovsky, chairman of <br>
the board of Rosprom (earlier he was chairman of Menatep <br>
Bank) has added his voice to that of Gazprom chairman Rem <br>
Vyakhirev, who earlier this week called on Russian <br>
entrepreneurs to unite in search of solutions to the <br>
country's financial problems. (Interfax, November 6) <br>
Khodorkovsky said that Russia's twenty largest firms <br>
currently produce 55 percent of industrial output and <br>
employ over 20 percent of the industrial workforce. He <br>
said that since these companies are supporting economic <br>
and social stability in Russia and "underwriting the <br>
competitiveness of Russian products on world markets," <br>
the government should adopt "flexible" and "supportive" <br>
policies toward them. Stripped of rhetoric, this seems to <br>
be yet another call for tax breaks. It comes at a time <br>
when the government's emergency tax commission is <br>
cracking down (very selectively) on enterprises with <br>
large tax arrears. Khodorkovsky predicted that in a <br>
decade's time the Russian economy will be dominated by 50 <br>
or so industrial conglomerates such as Gazprom, LUKoil <br>
and Yukos (the oil giant of which Menatep acquired <br>
control in last year's controversial loans for shares <br>
scheme).<br>
<p>
SMOKE AND MIRRORS IN RUSSIA'S MILITARY BUDGET. State Duma <br>
member and Russian defense intellectual Aleksey Arbatov <br>
has argued in a recent issue of Obshchaya gazeta that <br>
funding of the armed forces has to date been conducted in <br>
an unworkable fashion. The process starts with the <br>
government's proposed budget, one that in theory is <br>
agreed upon by all the ministries. For 1997, the <br>
government requested some 101 trillion rubles for <br>
national defense. Arbatov points out, however, that the <br>
Finance Ministry is never able to fully fund the budget, <br>
so that even if this amount is approved some 20-25 <br>
percent of it will be sequestered and carried over into <br>
1998 as arrears. But, as he notes, the government already <br>
owes the military more than 26 trillion rubles in <br>
arrears.<br>
<p>
This means that the armed forces have less to spend on <br>
procurement, R&amp;D, capital construction, and operations <br>
and maintenance than the budget would indicate. Arbatov <br>
is particularly concerned about shortfalls in procurement <br>
and R&amp;D. While the new budget seems to call for a 70 <br>
percent increase in procurement, Arbatov says that, in <br>
fact, some six trillion rubles will be used to pay off <br>
arrears for work already done under the previous budget <br>
and another 5 trillion will go to banks for credit. That <br>
will actually leave the military two trillion less to <br>
spend for new weapons than in 1996 -- a year when, in his <br>
words, the low rate of procurement left the defense <br>
industrial sector "comatose." Even to maintain defense <br>
spending at its current (low) level, Arbatov argues, <br>
requires allocation of an additional 40 trillion rubles. <br>
This, he admits "will completely squeeze out" social <br>
spending and investment. But a failure to allocate the <br>
additional funds, Arbatov says, would mean that Russia's <br>
military "will be completely destroyed as an organized <br>
force." <br>
<p>
Arbatov has some interesting things to say about the <br>
personnel strength of the armed forces. Apparently only <br>
the military leadership knows the true figures, and they <br>
aren't talking. Arbatov also suggests that the Defense <br>
Ministry is skimming off payroll money and using it for <br>
purposes other than paying officers and enlisted <br>
personnel. He also claims that there are considerably <br>
more personnel in the armed forces than the 1.7 million <br>
authorized in the current law. Arbatov accepts that 10 <br>
trillion rubles are owed in wages, and calls for this <br>
amount to be added to the budget. But he recommends that <br>
this be done only on one condition: that the Defense <br>
Ministry submit precise payroll figures and account for <br>
every ruble spent. (Obshchaya gazeta, No. 40)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
BLACK SEA FLEET TALKS ADJOURN IN DISAGREEMENT. As <br>
previously predicted in the Monitor (see Monitor, October <br>
25 and 31) and contrary to misleading reports since the <br>
October 24 Yeltsin-Kuchma meeting, a breakthrough in the <br>
Black Sea Fleet negotiations is not imminent. Yesterday <br>
in Kiev Ukrainian leaders stood their ground at a new <br>
round of talks that was supposed to wrap up a compromise <br>
in order to pave the way for bilateral economic and <br>
political agreements. The Russian delegation broke up the <br>
meeting after the first of two scheduled sessions, even <br>
canceling its participation in a dinner with the <br>
Ukrainian side. <br>
<p>
The talks were "marked by tensions and a heavy <br>
atmosphere," according to Ukrainian security and defense <br>
council secretary Volodymyr Horbulin. He and other <br>
Ukrainian officials indicated that the Russian <br>
delegation, led by Deputy Prime Minister Valery Serov, <br>
surprised Kiev with a set of new and unacceptable demands <br>
aimed at maximizing Russia's presence and rights in <br>
Sevastopol while correspondingly minimizing those of <br>
Ukraine. (Interfax-Ukraine, November 6)<br>
<p>
In Moscow, recently-named General Staff chief Gen. Viktor <br>
Samsonov stated that he is "firmly convinced that Russia <br>
must not give up Sevastopol." The deputy commander in <br>
chief of Russia's naval forces, Adm. Igor Kasatonov, <br>
publicly came out in support of the Duma's October 23 <br>
bill, which would halt the partition of the Black Sea <br>
Fleet, declare the fleet to be Russian property, and <br>
claim exclusive Russian basing rights in Sevastopol. <br>
(Moskovskie novosti, November 3; Interfax, November 6) <br>
These various demands contradict the Russian government's <br>
officially stated policy, but the government is <br>
increasingly using such statements to intensify the <br>
pressure on Kiev. <br>
<p>
Ukrainian officials now doubt that Russian prime minister <br>
Viktor Chernomyrdin's much-delayed visit -- to which they <br>
attach disproportionate value -- can take place anytime <br>
soon. Facing artificially imposed deadlines and Russian <br>
pressures on energy, trade, and debt issues, Ukrainian <br>
leaders recently gave every indication of a readiness to <br>
rush to a compromise agreement on the fleet. Kiev's <br>
signals could not have failed to encourage the escalation <br>
in Moscow's demands, which, in turn, apparently ended up <br>
stiffening Kiev's spine.<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
GEORGIAN-CHECHEN RAPPROCHEMENT COULD DEPRIVE MOSCOW OF <br>
MAJOR POLICY CARDS. Chechen president-in-waiting <br>
Zelimkhan Yandarbiev and Prime Minister Aslan Maskhadov <br>
are cited as having told Georgian journalists this week <br>
that they seek a meeting with the Georgian leadership -- <br>
"any time, any place" -- to overcome differences and <br>
become "real allies" and "strategic partners." The two <br>
Chechen leaders blamed Moscow for misleading the Chechens <br>
into supporting Abkhazia's secession against Georgia. <br>
"Unfortunately we were slow to understand that the <br>
Kremlin involved us in that conflict by telling us to <br>
help the Abkhaz as our Muslim brothers. That was a dirty <br>
policy directed not only against Georgia but, as it <br>
turned out, also against us," Maskhadov was quoted as <br>
saying. Yandarbiev, in turn, reportedly described as <br>
"impermissible Abkhazia's drift toward Russia and <br>
secession from Georgia." (Akhali Taoba [Tbilisi weekly], <br>
November 4, as cited by Ekho Moskvy, Interfax, <br>
Nezavisimaya gazeta, November 4-6)<br>
<p>
Elite Chechen fighters under Shamil Basaev, armed and <br>
trained by Russian secret services, fought in the <br>
Russian-assisted Abkhaz war of secession against Georgia. <br>
Chechen support for Abkhazia continued afterward, based <br>
in part on a misperception of Georgian president Eduard <br>
Shevardnadze as a Russian pawn. The Chechens bet on the <br>
wrong Georgian horse by supporting Georgian president <br>
Zviad Gamsakhurdia and, after his death, the "Zviadists" <br>
in Georgia. That policy was based on the forlorn hope of <br>
creating with them a grand regional alliance against <br>
Russian hegemony. Shevardnadze, in turn, became the most <br>
outspoken supporter of Moscow's policy in Chechnya during <br>
the war. Setting the Chechens and other North Caucasus <br>
peoples at loggerheads with Georgia was a masterstroke of <br>
Russian policy, achieved through exacerbating otherwise <br>
bridgeable religious and ethnic differences. Shevardnadze <br>
will certainly not allow Georgia to become involved in <br>
anti-Russian policies. But a mere normalization and <br>
reconciliation between Georgia and Chechnya would deprive <br>
Moscow of major cards in the region.<br>
<p>
SOUTH OSSETIAN SECESSIONIST ELECTION ENCOURAGED BY <br>
GEORGIA'S NORTHERN NEIGHBOR. President Akhsarbek Galazov <br>
of the Russian Federation's republic of North Ossetia has <br>
endorsed the planned presidential election in South <br>
Ossetia, the breakaway region of Georgia. In an address <br>
to the people of South Ossetia, Galazov also said he <br>
personally hoped for the election of a president there <br>
who would contribute to the attainment of political <br>
status for South Ossetia and to its "integration with <br>
North Ossetia." The two Ossetias are "closely linked not <br>
only ethnically and culturally but also politically," <br>
Galazov said in his address. (Iprinda, November 5)<br>
<p>
South Ossetia's presidential election, planned for this <br>
month, seeks to cement the region's separation from <br>
Georgia and to support its elevation to republican <br>
status. North Ossetia's Galazov, considered Moscow's most <br>
loyal supporter in the Caucasus, could hardly have sent <br>
his address without clearance from the central <br>
authorities. The Russian government has been careful to <br>
avoid being seen as encouraging South Ossetian separation <br>
from Georgia and a change of borders, but it has used <br>
North Ossetia to hold above Tbilisi's head the Damocles' <br>
sword of South Ossetian secession. <br>

YELTSIN RECLAIMS HIS POWERS. Less than 24 hours after his <br>
heart by-pass operation, President Boris Yeltsin has <br>
taken back the presidential powers he had ceded to Prime <br>
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin during the surgery. (BBC <br>
World Service, November 6) Yeltsin, who signed the decree <br>
taking back his powers at 6 o'clock this morning, seems <br>
determined to avoid the appearance of a power vacuum in <br>
the Kremlin.<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN WORKERS PROTEST. Yeltsin's surgery eclipsed <br>
yesterday's nationwide strikes, called to demand stronger <br>
social guarantees and payment of wage arrears now <br>
believed to total $8 billion. Workers took part in <br>
marches and demonstrations all over Russia. Union <br>
organizers claimed that some 15 million people had <br>
participated, while the Ministry of Internal Affairs <br>
claimed the number was only 320,000. The largest numbers <br>
were in Moscow, Primorsky krai, and Kemerovo, Omsk and <br>
Rostov oblasts. (Interfax, November 5)<br>
<p>
CHUBAIS WIDENS AUTHORITY. President Yeltsin has signed a <br>
decree giving the presidential administration a new role <br>
-- monitoring the "power ministries." These ministries, <br>
which include Defense, Internal Affairs and Security, are <br>
directly responsible to the president, although Yeltsin <br>
has subordinated them to the prime minister while he <br>
receives medical treatment. Yeltsin's chief-of-staff, <br>
Anatoly Chubais, will now also have a monitoring role. <br>
(Izvestiya, November 5)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN-SOUTH KOREAN DEFENSE ACCORD. The defense chiefs <br>
of South Korea and Russia have signed a memorandum on <br>
military cooperation that Moscow hopes will boost its <br>
arms sales to the Asian nation. The document, said to <br>
involve primarily military-technical cooperation, was <br>
signed in Moscow on November 4. Russia is angling to win <br>
a lucrative contract to supply South Korea with advanced <br>
fighter jets. (UPI, November 4)<br>
<p>
U.S., RUSSIAN CHIEFS OF STAFF DISCUSS COOPERATION. During <br>
a one-day visit to Moscow, Gen. John Shalikashvili, the <br>
chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, discussed <br>
military cooperation between Russia and the U.S. with his <br>
Russian counterpart, Gen. Viktor Samsonov. The two were <br>
reported to have agreed on the future of the Russian and <br>
U.S. peacekeeping contingents in Bosnia. Samsonov said <br>
there was a possibility joint war games might be held <br>
next year. (Interfax, November 5)<br>
<p>
UKRAINE CENTRALIZES ARMS EXPORTS. The Ukrainian <br>
government has created a state-owned company to control <br>
arms exports. The new company, Ukrspetseksport will work <br>
to consolidate Ukraine's initial success in selling arms <br>
abroad. Cooperation with Russia in the defense sectors is <br>
also envisaged, including the creation of a Russian-<br>
Ukrainian financial group. (Itar-Tass, November 5) A <br>
recent report said Ukraine's biggest sale -- 350 T-80 UD <br>
tanks to Pakistan -- is in jeopardy due to a lack of <br>
capital to start the assembly lines. (Trud-7, November 1)<br>
<p>
SURPLUS TANKS WANTED FOR CHERNOBYL. The Ukrainian <br>
military wants to use 159 tanks and 332 armored personnel <br>
carriers at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant rather than <br>
scrap them as called for in the Conventional Forces in <br>
Europe (CFE) treaty. At an October 4 briefing in Kiev, <br>
the army's chief inspector, Maj. Gen. Nikolai <br>
Goncharenko, said the treaty should be adapted to the <br>
"new realities in Europe." (Itar-Tass, November 4)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
RUSSIA'S NEW POLICY IN CHECHNYA: A RETURN TO THE CARROT. <br>
Russia's Security Council met on November 4 under the <br>
chairmanship of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. <br>
Chechnya dominated the agenda. Chernomyrdin confirmed <br>
that Moscow is seriously considering creating a free <br>
economic zone (FEZ) in Chechnya. (RTR, NTV, November 4) <br>
This would be an unusual FEZ in that it would encompass <br>
the entire republic. The blueprint for the zone was <br>
prepared by former deputy prime minister (now Duma <br>
deputy) Sergei Shakhrai, who has been discussing the plan <br>
with an informal group of deputies representing all <br>
parliamentary factions. (Nezavisimaya gazeta, October 30; <br>
Interfax, November 5)<br>
<p>
Shakhrai argues that creating a FEZ in Chechnya will give <br>
the Chechen leadership a financial incentive to remain <br>
within the Russian Federation while at the same time <br>
allowing the federal authorities to erect a cordon <br>
sanitaire around the republic and isolate it from the <br>
rest of the Russian economy. Shakhrai argues that this is <br>
necessary because Chechnya's economy is now dominated by <br>
criminal gangs. But he says that if Russia tried openly <br>
to erect a cordon sanitaire around Chechnya, there would <br>
be an outcry from the international community. Shakhrai <br>
believes that a FEZ would attract legitimate foreign <br>
investment to the republic, which would eventually <br>
squeeze out the gangs. Russia itself, he claims, has no <br>
money to invest in Chechen reconstruction, so the <br>
Chechens must be allowed free use of their natural <br>
resources (oil) to rebuild their economy. All Russia can <br>
and should contribute, Shakhrai says, is humanitarian aid <br>
and pension payments. "Tax money [raised in Chechnya] <br>
will remain in the republic," he says, "and federal money <br>
won't be sent there, [since] only two percent of Russians <br>
support the idea of sending tax money to a republic <br>
striving for independence." (Nezavisimaya gazeta, October <br>
30; NTV, November 4; Interfax, November 5) The Chechen <br>
authorities are said to be keen on a FEZ, but insist that <br>
it be set up on the basis not of a Russian law (as <br>
Chernomyrdin and Shakhrai envisage) but of an agreement <br>
between the Russian and Chechen governments.<br>
<p>
Moscow's decision to switch from carrot to stick is not a <br>
new tactic. Just before Russian troops were sent into <br>
Chechnya the possibility of an economic blockade of the <br>
republic was examined. Whether or not economic coercion <br>
would have worked then is a moot point. But after a year <br>
and a half of war, the situation has fundamentally <br>
changed. Now, Chechnya has a battle-hardened army whose <br>
fighters have no doubt that they have defeated Russia. <br>
The Chechen leaders are not asking for economic aid -- <br>
they are demanding contributions. "Just to pull out their <br>
troops, without paying us any compensation -- that won't <br>
do. The war won't be over until Russia pays Chechnya for <br>
everything, in full," rebel leader Shamil Basayev told <br>
Monitor.<br>
<p>
RUSSIA RIPS U.S. OVER ARREST OF FORMER AGENT. Russia's <br>
Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) denounced Washington <br>
on November 4-5 for the October 29 arrest of a former <br>
Soviet intelligence officer. According to a November 4 <br>
SVR statement, Vladimir Galkin had retired from foreign <br>
intelligence work in 1992, and had been granted a visa by <br>
American authorities for a visit to the U.S. despite full <br>
disclosure of his previous professional activities. The <br>
statement charged that the granting of the visa and the <br>
subsequent arrest at New York's JFK airport had been a <br>
set-up and a contravention of the normal rules governing <br>
treatment of former intelligence personnel. It called the <br>
action a "dirty trick" and warned that "former U.S. <br>
intelligence agents who visit Russia will not thank the <br>
FBI for this." Despite the threat, an SVR spokesperson <br>
suggested that Moscow was working for Galkin's quick <br>
release in the hope that it would obviate the need for <br>
any retaliatory actions. (Interfax, Reuter, November 4)<br>
<p>
Galkin is accused by the U.S. of having worked in 1990-<br>
1991 with an Indian businessman in an effort to procure <br>
U.S. military data that included information on the <br>
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). According to court <br>
papers filed by the FBI, Galkin offered $10,000 each for <br>
three reports dealing with SDI, electronic warfare, and <br>
other U.S. strategic systems. Russian diplomats said that <br>
Galkin is to be arraigned in Boston, and that he faces <br>
eight or more years in prison. Galkin had arrived in the <br>
U.S. on a business visa as part of a delegation that also <br>
included Russian Interior Ministry representatives. He is <br>
described as the manager of a Russian-American company <br>
called Knowledge Express, which is said to deal in <br>
telecommunication security systems. (AP, Itar-Tass, <br>
November 5; Kommersant-daily, October 31) <br>
<p>
The detention of Galkin has reportedly incensed SVR <br>
leaders. It follows several well-publicized incidents in <br>
which Russian authorities claimed to have apprehended <br>
Western intelligence operatives working on Russian <br>
territory. Those cases, in turn, have been used to <br>
buttress the claims of Russia's intelligence <br>
establishment that Western intelligence services (and <br>
those of some Eastern European and former Soviet <br>
countries) have significantly stepped up their espionage <br>
activities in Russia. (See Monitor, September 6, 26)<br>
<p>
PRIMAKOV REBUFFS RYBKIN ON NATO REMARKS. Russian foreign <br>
minister Yevgeny Primakov yesterday dismissed a recent <br>
proposal by Security Council secretary Ivan Rybkin that <br>
called for Moscow to join NATO's political wing. Primakov <br>
said that "nobody really wants" Russia in NATO -- and <br>
neither does Moscow. Primakov also reasserted his <br>
ministry's primacy in the formulation of foreign policy, <br>
and chided Rybkin for interfering -- as his predecessor <br>
Aleksandr Lebed had done -- in Russia's relations with <br>
NATO. "The Security Council secretaries have developed a <br>
sort of hobby in speaking on questions of Russia's <br>
participation in NATO," Primakov observed, "but Russian <br>
foreign policy is formulated by the Foreign Ministry, and <br>
it maintains, as before, a negative attitude toward <br>
NATO's eastward enlargement." (Interfax, Itar-Tass, <br>
November 5) In the wake of Rybkin's remarks on NATO, some <br>
Russian commentators speculated that the Security Council <br>
would play a greater role in Russia's dealings with the <br>
Western alliance. (See Monitor, November 4)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
LUKASHENKO TO STAGE UNLAWFUL REFERENDUM. Belarus <br>
president Aleksandr Lukashenko yesterday accused the <br>
Constitutional Court of "grossly violating the <br>
constitution" because of a verdict reached by the court <br>
that deprived a planned constitutional referendum of <br>
legal value. The Court "played the role assigned to it by <br>
opponents of the people's will," Lukashenko charged in a <br>
presidential address. He vowed to conduct the November 24 <br>
referendum, which would grant Lukashenko sweeping powers. <br>
Lukashenko also signed a decree declaring that the <br>
referendum's result would be legally binding, that it <br>
would immediately be signed into law by the president <br>
without requiring any parliamentary confirmation, and <br>
that it would not be subject to revision except by <br>
another referendum plus presidential consent.<br>
<p>
In an 8 to 3 vote the preceding day the Court had ruled -<br>
- despite pressure from the president -- hat the planned <br>
constitutional referendum could only have a consultative <br>
character. It also declared that the referendum's result <br>
would not be legally binding and that any follow-up <br>
action to amend or revise the constitution would be up to <br>
the parliament. (Belaplan, Interfax, November 4 and 5)<br>
<p>
The Court was responding to parliament chairman Syamyon <br>
Sharetsky's request for a ruling on the constitutionality <br>
of the planned referendum. The ruling was supposed to <br>
consider rival constitutional drafts submitted by the <br>
president and the parliament. The parliament is now all <br>
but certain to withdraw its constitutional draft from <br>
consideration and to confirm its allegiance to the <br>
existing constitution. Lukashenko's government, <br>
exacerbating the tension, is withholding funds from <br>
parliamentary by-elections also scheduled for November <br>
24.<br>
<p>
UKRAINE-GEORGIA: "SPECIAL RELATIONS" TO BUTTRESS EACH <br>
OTHER'S INDEPENDENCE. On a three-day visit to Georgia, <br>
during which he conferred with President Eduard <br>
Shevardnadze, Ukrainian prime minister Pavlo Lazarenko <br>
and officials accompanying him concluded a set of far-<br>
reaching agreements with their Georgian counterparts. The <br>
agreements come amid an accelerating political <br>
rapprochement between the two countries. <br>
<p>
The talks focused on Ukrainian imports of Caspian oil <br>
through Georgia, and on Ukraine's participation in <br>
creating a proposed transit corridor of highway, rail, <br>
maritime, and air routes from Central Asia across the <br>
Transcaucasus to Europe. The sides decided in the near <br>
term to begin transportation of crude oil and liquefied <br>
gas from Azerbaijan via Georgia and the Black Sea to <br>
Ukraine. They set up a joint commission to submit within <br>
a few months the plans for, among other things, the use <br>
of pipeline and overland routes from Baku (Azerbaijan) to <br>
Georgia's Black Sea ports of Poti and/or Batumi. They <br>
also agreed to the immediate establishment of a ferry <br>
link from Poti to Illichivsk, the roll-on-roll-off <br>
ferryboat port near Odessa.<br>
<p>
The Ukrainian side stressed its interest in joining the <br>
recent agreement among Georgia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, <br>
and Uzbekistan on transit facilities and preferential <br>
tariffs along the route from Central Asia to the Black <br>
Sea. It was agreed that Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma <br>
will join Shevardnadze and Azerbaijani president Haidar <br>
Aliev in a common proposal to the European Bank for <br>
Reconstruction and Development to allocate credits for <br>
transporting Caspian fuels to Europe and for creating the <br>
transit corridor. <br>
<p>
A set of military agreements was also signed. They <br>
envisage Ukrainian training of Georgian officers, <br>
technical assistance in equipping military airports and <br>
ensuring their security, and unspecified "interaction" <br>
among the two navies. Georgian state minister <br>
(Lazarenko's counterpart as Georgia's equivalent of a <br>
prime minister) Niko Lekishvili made a statement <br>
"supporting Ukraine's just position" on the partition of <br>
the ex-Soviet Black Sea Fleet. Ukraine's flagship Hetman <br>
Sahaydachny is currently paying a visit to Poti, the <br>
second Ukrainian naval visit to Georgia in the space of <br>
two months. Officials spoke of a "special relationship" <br>
developing between the two countries. (Interfax-Ukraine, <br>
November 4 and 5)<br>
<p>
Lazarenko stated the obvious when he pointed out that <br>
fuel imports from the Transcaucasus would reduce <br>
Ukraine's dependence on Russian fuel supplies. Ukraine's <br>
goal meets Georgia's no less vital interest in promoting <br>
the westward route for a large share of the Caspian oil, <br>
as opposed to the northward route through Russia. <br>
Georgia, moreover, seeks to reduce its dependence on <br>
Russian military assistance in the creation of its <br>
national army, and is increasingly turning to Ukraine for <br>
support. Yesterday's set of military agreements follows <br>
one signed last month in Kiev. Ukraine has endorsed <br>
Georgia's claim to a share of Black Sea Fleet coast <br>
guard-type warships, and yesterday's talks presage a <br>
longer-term alignment between the two countries on <br>
contentious Black Sea issues.<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
MOSCOW CONTINUES DOUBLE DEALING ON ABKHAZIA. The Russian <br>
Foreign Ministry's envoy for special assignments, Gennady <br>
Ilichev, conferred in Sukhumi with Abkhaz leaders on the <br>
future course of Georgian-Abkhaz negotiations. Ilichev <br>
claimed that Tbilisi had declined to join in "tripartite" <br>
consultations over the return of Georgian refugees to <br>
Abkhazia. The Russian envoy failed to mention publicly, <br>
let alone disavow, parliamentary elections planned by <br>
Abkhazia on November 23 despite the absence of the <br>
expelled Georgian population. Ilichev also stated that he <br>
had ascertained the Abkhaz leaders' position in rejecting <br>
the inclusion of Western countries -- members of the <br>
"Club of Georgia's Friends" -- in the negotiations <br>
devoted to settling the Abkhazia conflict. (Interfax, <br>
November 4 and 5) Georgian president Eduard Shevardnadze <br>
for his part told the country on radio that Moscow ought <br>
to disapprove of the planned Abkhaz elections as a matter <br>
of Russian policy, not merely in the form of personal <br>
opinions of some officials as has been the case. This <br>
"would help dispel the well-grounded doubts concerning <br>
the Russian government's stand," Shevardnadze said. <br>
(Radio Tbilisi, November 4)<br>
<p>
The issue of including "Georgia's Friends" in the <br>
negotiations adds to the known differences between Moscow <br>
and Tbilisi. That group of countries consists of the four <br>
Western permanent member countries of the UN Security <br>
Council plus Germany, which is perhaps the most active <br>
Western country in promoting a settlement consistent with <br>
Georgia's independence and territorial integrity. Moscow <br>
is hiding behind the Abkhaz refusal to keep "Georgia's <br>
Friends" out of the negotiations. UN secretary general <br>
Boutros Boutros-Ghali's special envoy for Abkhazia, <br>
Edouard Brunner, on a recent visit to Abkhazia similarly <br>
contented himself with recording the Abkhaz leaders' <br>
refusal to include those countries. <br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
KAZAKHSTAN'S ECONOMIC PROSPECTS. Kazakhstan has been <br>
winning praise for its economic performance. During a <br>
recent meeting in Tokyo, World Bank representatives <br>
highlighted Kazakhstan's economic achievements and its <br>
leading role among Central Asian countries. (Itar-Tass, <br>
November 1) In addition, Standard and Poor's pointed <br>
yesterday to the relatively promising performance of the <br>
Kazakh economy when announcing its debt ratings for <br>
Kazakhstan. Almaty's external debt situation is more <br>
favorable than that of other countries with similar <br>
ratings and, given its oil and mineral resources, <br>
Kazakhstan boasts strong export and investment potential. <br>
However, among the constraints on Kazakhstan's <br>
creditworthiness Standard and Poor's mentioned its <br>
geographic position, which requires that agreements be <br>
reached with its neighbors, and especially with Russia, <br>
on transit and trade issues. (Western agencies, November <br>
5)<br>
<p>
This dependence helps explain Kazakhstan's commitment to <br>
the development of trade links with Russia and the other <br>
two states in the CIS Customs Union -- Belarus and <br>
Kyrgyzstan. During a recent visit to Japan to discuss the <br>
provision of financial assistance by a group of donor <br>
countries and the World Bank, Kazakh prime minister <br>
Akezhan Kazhegeldin pointed out that projects for joint <br>
production and marketing are being considered by the four <br>
states in the customs union. He added that Japanese <br>
trading houses are prepared to offer financing for such <br>
projects and that Japanese business leaders understand <br>
the advantages of eliminating customs barriers in trade <br>
between the four states.(Itar-Tass, November 1)<br>
<p>
Donor countries agreed in Tokyo on November 1 to grant <br>
Kazakhstan a $1.35 billion loan to support its balance of <br>
payments. (Itar-Tass, November 1) Meanwhile, the Kazakh <br>
government has sought both to involve donor countries in <br>
a number of joint projects and has adopted a positive <br>
attitude toward the involvement of Russian capital in the <br>
Kazakh economy.<br>

NEWS:<br>
<p>
YELTSIN UNDERGOES SURGERY. Russian president Boris <br>
Yeltsin underwent heart bypass surgery this morning. The <br>
Kremlin says there were no complications and that the 7-<br>
hour operation is now over. Before going into surgery, <br>
Yeltsin signed a decree temporarily transferring his <br>
presidential powers to Prime Minister Viktor <br>
Chernomyrdin. Yeltsin has had three heart attacks in the <br>
past 15 months. (BBC World Service, November 5)<br>
<p>
FEDERAL PROPERTY TRANSFERS TO THE REGIONS ENVISAGED. The <br>
Russian government intends to give to the relevant <br>
regional authorities its shares in a number of federal <br>
enterprises. The transfers, which will occur in the last <br>
quarter of this year, are valued at up to 500 billion <br>
rubles. They will be used to offset federal debts towards <br>
the regions and will be considered as privatization <br>
revenues, according to a member of the State Property <br>
Committee. (Interfax, November 4)<br>
<p>
WORLD BANK TO RELEASE CREDIT TO THE RUSSIAN COAL <br>
INDUSTRY. The second part of a $500 million credit, <br>
granted in June to Russia by the World Bank for the <br>
restructuring of the coal industry and the improvement of <br>
living conditions for its workers, will be disbursed <br>
before the end of the year, according to a World Bank <br>
representative. Disagreements on the observance of the <br>
conditions for the credit have delayed the release of the <br>
unused $250 million. (Russian Business TV, November 4)<br>
<p>
BONN PROPOSES ENHANCING RUSSIA-NATO RELATIONSHIP. German <br>
foreign minister Klaus Kinkel was quoted as saying on <br>
November 2 that NATO should create a 17-member <br>
consultation committee on security that would include <br>
Russia and replace the existing "16+1" relationship <br>
between Moscow and the alliance. Kinkel proposed that <br>
Russia should enjoy equal rights with NATO members on the <br>
committee, but did not specify the weight that decisions <br>
reached by the new committee would carry within NATO. <br>
(Reuter, November 2)<br>
<p>
MOSCOW SHOULD BASE TROOPS IN BALKANS. Russian Defense <br>
Council secretary Yuri Baturin, who recently returned <br>
from a trip to the Balkans, said on October 31 that <br>
Moscow should aim to establish a military base in that <br>
part of the world. According to Baturin, Russia has <br>
always had interests and influence in the Balkans, and it <br>
is natural that it should seek to restore its presence <br>
there -- particularly in view of NATO's planned eastward <br>
expansion. (Ekho Moskvy, October 31)<br>
<p>
CHEMICAL WEAPONS BAN TO GO FORWARD. On October 31 Hungary <br>
became the 65th signatory of the 1993 Chemical Weapons <br>
Convention to ratify the treaty and thus it will enter <br>
into force on April 29, 1997. While the convention still <br>
has not been ratified by the U.S. or Russia -- possessors <br>
of the world's largest chemical weapons stockpiles -- the <br>
two countries as signatories will still be bound by the <br>
convention's terms. <br>
<p>
BELARUSAN HIGH COURT BLUNTS LUKASHENKO'S REFERENDUM <br>
WEAPON. In a decision awaited with trepidation, the <br>
Belarus Constitutional Court ruled yesterday that the <br>
constitutional referendum demanded by President Aleksandr <br>
Lukashenko and scheduled for November 24 can only have a <br>
consultative character, and its outcome would not be <br>
legally binding. (ORT, November 4)<br>
<p>
UKRAINE AND GEORGIA TO DISCUSS EURASIAN CORRIDOR. The <br>
creation of a Eurasian Transport Corridor is to be <br>
discussed during a visit to Georgia by Ukrainian prime <br>
minister Pavel Lazarenko. According to a Georgian <br>
official, Azerbaijan will also be involved in the <br>
project, which would stretch from Baku to Odessa. Ukraine <br>
plans to join an existing agreement on freight transport <br>
between Georgia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. <br>
(Interfax, Itar-Tass, 4 November)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
OPPOSITION CANDIDATES WIN IN PSKOV, MAGADAN. Voters <br>
rejected Kremlin-supported incumbents in gubernatorial <br>
elections on November 3 in Pskov and Magadan oblasts. <br>
These were the latest results in a series of regional <br>
elections across Russia, and suggest a new tendency by <br>
voters to reject government-approved candidates.<br>
<p>
In remote Magadan oblast in Russia's Far East, eight time <br>
zones away from Moscow, voters threw out the incumbent, <br>
Viktor Mikhailov, who had been in office since 1991. They <br>
replaced him with Valentin Tsvetkov, a local businessman. <br>
While Tsvetkov is not a Communist, his victory was <br>
facilitated by the fact that the Communist-dominated <br>
Popular-Patriotic Union (NPS) called on voters to support <br>
him. (RTR, November 4)<br>
<p>
In Pskov oblast, in the north-western corner of Russia <br>
along the border with Estonia, Latvia and Belarus, the <br>
incumbent was rejected in favor of 33-year-old Yevgenii <br>
Mikhailov, a member of Vladimir Zhirinovsky's quaintly <br>
named Liberal Democratic party (LDPR). Mikhailov was <br>
strongly supported by Zhirinovsky, who spent three days <br>
stumping the region, but he was also helped by the fact <br>
that the NPS gave him its support. (RTR, November 4) <br>
Popular discontent is high in Pskov, which has one of the <br>
highest unemployment rates in the whole of Russia. There <br>
is a strong military presence in the region, which serves <br>
as base for the elite Pskov airborne division, and <br>
Zhirinovsky's appeal has traditionally been high among <br>
military units.<br>
<p>
It is too soon to conclude that voters have turned <br>
decisively against Kremlin-sponsored candidates, and many <br>
other elections have still to be held by year's end. But <br>
suggestions of such a turn of heart are there. The first <br>
sign that the tide might turn came when incumbent Anatoly <br>
Sobchak was defeated in St. Petersburg in May, indicating <br>
that the heady era of democratic leaders was over. But <br>
Sobchak's defeat was followed by a landslide victory for <br>
incumbent Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov in June, and another <br>
landslide for the incumbent in Saratov oblast on <br>
September 1. Dmitri Ayatskov's victory in Saratov was <br>
interpreted as a sign that incumbents would be reelected <br>
in the post-presidential election honeymoon as long as <br>
they were perceived by voters to be pragmatists who could <br>
protect the interests of their regions. <br>
<p>
But as Yeltsin's sickness turned him into a lame duck <br>
president, and following his rescinding of the lavish <br>
election spending promises made during his presidential <br>
campaign, many voters began to feel that they had been <br>
duped. As the present series of regional elections <br>
progresses, voters seem increasingly to be turning to <br>
opposition candidates as a means of registering a protest <br>
vote. That would explain the election of Aleksandr <br>
Rutskoi in Kursk on October 20, the victory of the <br>
nationalist candidate in Kirov oblast on the same day, <br>
and last weekend's elections in Pskov and Magadan. The <br>
total of "opposition" victories is still slightly lower <br>
than Kremlin-friendly ones. But there are lots more <br>
elections to come. <br>
<p>
RUSSIAN WORKERS PLAN PROTESTS. Under the rallying cry <br>
"for work, wages and social guarantees," workers will <br>
launch protest actions across much of Russia today. <br>
According to the Federation of Independent Trade Unions <br>
of Russia (FITUR), some 10 million workers will take part <br>
in various demonstrations. (Interfax, November 4) The <br>
workers' main complaint involves wage arrears, which the <br>
Labor Ministry reports have increased by 2.7 times this <br>
year and totaled 43.1 trillion rubles at the end of <br>
October. (Interfax, November 2) On November 2, a three-<br>
party commission formed by representatives of the <br>
government, employers, and workers agreed to a schedule <br>
for the repayment of wages. A FITUR official observed, <br>
however, that similar accords had not been implemented in <br>
the past (Itar-Tass, November 4) Russia's labor minister, <br>
meanwhile, criticized businessmen and local authorities <br>
who had failed to honor their payment obligations, <br>
despite having the means to do so. He singled out <br>
Novgorod, Dagestan and Perm as the worst offenders. <br>
(Itar-Tass, November 2) In an interview published <br>
yesterday, Finance Minister Aleksander Livshits denied <br>
accusations that delays in the payment of wages to state-<br>
funded employees constituted a deliberate attempt to <br>
control inflation while linking wage arrears to problems <br>
faced in tax collection. (Interfax, November 2)<br>
<p>
LUZHKOV PROMISES TO HELP GROZNY. Mayor Yuri Luzhkov of <br>
Moscow met yesterday in Moscow with the Mayor of Grozny, <br>
Lecho Dudaev (a cousin of the late president Djohar <br>
Dudaev). Luzhkov promised that Moscow would provide <br>
concrete help rebuilding Chechnya's war-ravaged capital. <br>
Luzhkov offered to start with school textbooks and <br>
scholarships for Grozny youngsters to Moscow colleges. He <br>
also said that, if federal funding is forthcoming, Moscow <br>
would help with housing construction. If it is not, <br>
Luzhkov offered to accept Chechen oil as payment. (RTR, <br>
Interfax, November 4)<br>
<p>
Luzhkov is constructing a wide and growing network of <br>
contacts between the Russian capital and other <br>
strategically located regional centers -- from St. <br>
Petersburg and Arkhangelsk to Saratov and Sevastopol. <br>
This is partly a way of spreading the influence of Moscow <br>
enterprises, the capital's banks and financial <br>
institutions in particular. But the regional contacts <br>
Luzhkov is making will also come in useful if he decides <br>
to stand for president. <br>
<p>
MILITARY PRESENCE IN KALININGRAD SAID TO BE DROPPING. The <br>
deputy commander of the Baltic Fleet yesterday told a <br>
Danish group visiting Kaliningrad oblast that there are <br>
no more than 30,000 troops in the Russian enclave nestled <br>
between Poland and Lithuania. (Interfax/BNS, November 4) <br>
Each of these countries has expressed concern in the past <br>
over Russia's military presence in Kaliningrad, and there <br>
have been proposals that the region should be <br>
demilitarized. At one time Western analysts estimated <br>
that there were as many as 200,000 troops there. In <br>
October 1994, Russia told Lithuania that there were <br>
40,000 troops in Kaliningrad, and that this number would <br>
eventually be reduced to 26,000. (Jane's Intelligence <br>
Review, December 1994) In 1995 the Kaliningrad Special <br>
Defense Region was created to embrace all the military <br>
units in the enclave. It was subordinated to the <br>
commander-in-chief of the Baltic Fleet. The main fleet <br>
base is at Baltiisk. <br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
BELARUSAN PRESIDENT TURNS TO ORTHODOX CHURCH. In his <br>
latest two speeches, including an All Souls' Day address <br>
to the country, Belarus president Aleksandr Lukashenko <br>
called for Christian Orthodoxy to become the official <br>
religion of Belarus. Deploring the "de-ideologization" <br>
and "spiritual vacuum" of the post-Soviet period, <br>
particularly among the youth, Lukashenko urged "returning <br>
the Orthodox religion to the people" as a unifying factor <br>
and "elevating the Orthodox Church to a new qualitative <br>
level." (Radio Minsk, Itar-Tass, Interfax, November 2-4) <br>
Lukashenko's draft constitution, which he wants approved <br>
in a controlled referendum on November 24, reportedly <br>
elevates Orthodoxy to official status.<br>
<p>
Lukashenko has taken considerably longer than other neo-<br>
Communist leaders to attempt instrumentalizing religious <br>
ritual for political purposes. The president needs all <br>
the support he can get in the referendum, and seeks to <br>
add some aura of respectability to his quest for personal <br>
rule. He has made an alliance with Metropolitan Filaret, <br>
head of the Orthodox Church in Belarus, subordinated to <br>
the Moscow Patriarchy. The Patriarch, Aleksy II, has more <br>
than once received Lukashenko and blessed his effort <br>
toward unification with Russia. Lukashenko's theme of <br>
"Slavic" unification on an Orthodox platform suits <br>
Russian nationalist, Communist, and official circles.<br>
<p>
Belarus is home to substantial Roman Catholic (mostly <br>
Polish), Eastern-rite Catholic (or Uniate, mostly ethnic <br>
Belarusan), and Jewish communities. Official statistics <br>
understate the numbers of Catholics of both rites; and <br>
there exists a certain correlation between Catholic <br>
affiliation and support for Belarusan independence. <br>
Authorities also fear the natural affinity of Belarusan <br>
Catholics of both rites for Poland and the Catholic West. <br>
Lukashenko's plan to privilege Orthodoxy seeks to promote <br>
an Eastern orientation and to open and exploit a <br>
political cleavage in society. <br>
<p>
UKRAINIAN REDS HOST ANTI-REFORM COMRADES. Ukraine's <br>
Communists, Socialists, and other leftist organizations <br>
celebrated the October Revolution anniversary in style at <br>
the Kiev National Opera over the weekend. Delegations of <br>
like-minded parties from Belarus, China, North Korea, <br>
Mongolia, Vietnam, and rump Yugoslavia attended. <br>
Ukrainian Communist party first secretary Petro <br>
Simonenko's keynote address dwelt on the social costs of <br>
the Ukrainian government's reforms, contrasting them with <br>
the leftist promise of a "just society." The leftists <br>
have called protest rallies in industrial centers for <br>
November 7. (Xinhua, November 2; UNIAN, November 4) <br>
Simonenko is one of the leaders of a sizable leftist <br>
political bloc capable of snagging the reforms through <br>
parliamentary obstruction and labor trouble. That bloc <br>
has just derailed passage of the government's budget in <br>
parliament, underscoring the political difficulties that <br>
the government must overcome in implementing reforms <br>
agreed upon with Western financial institutions. <br>
<p>
ASSASSINATION SHOCKS AND BAFFLES UKRAINE. Yevhen <br>
Shcherban, one of the richest businessmen in Donbass and <br>
in all Ukraine, was gunned down on November 3 in broad <br>
daylight and in front of scores of witnesses at Donetsk <br>
airport. Shcherban's wife was killed with him. Several <br>
bodyguards and members of his airplane crew were also <br>
killed or wounded. The three gunmen who meticulously <br>
performed the apparent contract killing left the scene <br>
unimpeded. Shcherban, 50, was president of Aton <br>
corporation. He was also a deputy to the Ukrainian <br>
parliament, belonging to its "Social Market Choice" <br>
faction, and a member of the Liberal party's executive <br>
committee. His firm dealt in fuels, metals, and <br>
foodstuffs. Ukrainian politicians yesterday expressed <br>
outrage and called for overdue measures against organized <br>
crime. (Interfax-Ukraine, November 4)<br>
<p>
No explanations for the murder have been offered beyond <br>
speculation about a settling of accounts among mafia <br>
clans. In July of this year some newspapers had obliquely <br>
and speculatively implicated Shcherban and the "Donetsk <br>
clan" in the unsuccessful assassination attempt against <br>
Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko. That attempt also remains <br>
unexplained. Shcherban's assassination seems bound to <br>
produce political tremors. <br>
<p>
MISSING UKRAINIAN MIG HIGHLIGHTS PROBLEMS IN EX-SOVIET <br>
AIR FORCES. A Ukrainian air force MiG-29 disappeared last <br>
Thursday while on a flight from an airbase on the Crimean <br>
peninsula to one near Kiev. Unless the wreckage of the <br>
plane can be found and recovered, the cause of this <br>
accident may never be determined. One plausible <br>
explanation is that there was something wrong with the <br>
pilot's oxygen system and he lost consciousness, since he <br>
was at an altitude of more than 10,000 meters (35,000 <br>
feet.) In dismissing suggestions that the pilot might <br>
have defected with the jet fighter, Ukrainian authorities <br>
released some amplifying information about the pilot and <br>
plane: he was a 39-year-old major named Oleg Kulik with <br>
500 flying hours, while the MiG was built in 1989 and had <br>
less than 400 hours in the air. Although an aide to the <br>
Defense Ministry suggested that the pilot's "training <br>
standard [and] the technical state of the aircraft" had <br>
ensured a safe flight, the statistics in fact speak <br>
volumes about the sorry state of the Ukrainian air force <br>
and, by inference, those of the other successor states of <br>
the Soviet Union.<br>
<p>
Kulik's 500 flight hours are little more than a military <br>
pilot in the West would receive during his flight <br>
training alone. Since he was a relatively senior officer <br>
-- probably approaching 18 or 20 years service -- the <br>
figures would also suggest that he was able to get into <br>
the cockpit no more than once or twice a month on the <br>
average. That is certainly not enough to stay proficient <br>
in a modern high-performance jet. Planes, like pilots, <br>
also need to be used to remain in top shape. On average, <br>
Kulik's MiG-29 flew less than 60 hours during each year <br>
of its 7-year life -- about one month's utilization for <br>
most Western fighters. <br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS <br>
<p>
ARMENIAN PRIME MINISTER REPLACED. Prime Minister Hrant <br>
Bagratian resigned yesterday "at his own request," and <br>
President Levon Ter-Petrosian appointed Armen Sarkisian <br>
to the post on the same day. Sarkisian, 43, a former <br>
Physics professor at Yerevan University, has served since <br>
1992 as ambassador to Britain and, concurrently, to <br>
several other West European countries. Since 1993 he has <br>
held the post of coordinator of Armenia's envoys to all <br>
European countries.<br>
<p>
No reasons were cited for Bagratian's release, but it had <br>
been expected as part of a comprehensive personnel <br>
reshuffle announced by Ter-Petrosian during his recent <br>
campaign for reelection. Bagratian had been prime <br>
minister since 1993. Ter-Petrosian changed the prime <br>
minister without waiting for the Constitutional Court's <br>
verdict, due this month, on the united opposition's <br>
petition to invalidate the recent presidential election <br>
because of official fraud. (Noyan-Tapan, Western <br>
agencies, November 4)<br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
TAJIK OPPOSITION OFFENSIVE OPENS CORRIDOR FROM <br>
AFGHANISTAN. Tajik opposition forces have established an <br>
overland route between the Afghan border and the <br>
opposition-controlled area in the Pamir foothills, <br>
according to Dushanbe military officials. The officials <br>
spoke following confirmation of reports that opposition <br>
units have captured several key villages in Tavildara <br>
district near the Afghan border, there a Tajik detachment <br>
successfully broke into Tajikistan from Afghanistan <br>
through Russian border troop defenses. The opposition <br>
captured important stockpiles of weapons, ammunition, and <br>
foodstuffs in Sagirdasht, which were defended by superior <br>
government forces unwilling to fight. Opposition units <br>
are closing in on Haburabad Pass, to which the government <br>
is rushing reinforcements. Capture of the pass would <br>
reliably secure the corridor just opened up by the <br>
opposition, expose Russian border troops to attacks from <br>
the rear, and all but doom the government's position in <br>
central and eastern Tajikistan. The government is <br>
appealing to the UN mission to stop the opposition's <br>
offensive. (Interfax, Itar-Tass, Radio Free Tajikistan, <br>
November 2 through 4)<br>

U.S. BUSINESSMAN ASSASSINATED IN MOSCOW. A U.S. businessman involved in a<br>
long dispute over control of one of Moscow's best-known hotels, the luxury<br>
Radisson-Slavyanskaya, was shot to death Sunday by an unknown gunman. Paul<br>
Tatum, 39, a former Republican party activist in Oklahoma, was killed by a<br>
single assailant near the entrance to the Kievsky metro station in downtown<br>
Moscow, a police spokesman said. (AP, November 4)<br>
<p>
DATE OF YELTSIN OPERATION TO BE SET TODAY. President Boris Yeltsin's doctors<br>
are expected to meet today to set the date for his heart surgery. The<br>
meeting will be attended by the leading heart surgeon, Michael DeBakey, who<br>
arrived in Moscow yesterday. But Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky<br>
hinted on November 1 that the time of the operation may not be announced<br>
until after it has taken place. He told reporters that Yeltsin had signed a<br>
decree giving Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin temporary authority to sign<br>
agreements with Russia's regions. Chernomyrdin will assume full presidential<br>
powers only during the operation, however. (Itar-Tass, November 1 and 3) <br>
<p>
GOVERNMENT CLAIMS TO BE WINNING THE BATTLE WITH TAX EVADERS. Emergency<br>
measures by the Russian government in the last two weeks have considerably<br>
increased the flow of revenues to the cash-strapped budget, presidential<br>
aide Anatoly Chubais claimed over the weekend. (Itar-Tass, November 2)<br>
Finance Minister Aleksandr Livshits confirmed that tax revenues had<br>
increased in the second half of October. Livshits told the Financial Times<br>
that mid-October was "the peak of the financial crisis" but that collection<br>
grew in the second half of the month and that, overall, tax collection was<br>
higher in October than in September. (Financial Times, November 2) It<br>
remains to be seen whether the effects of the government's highly publicized<br>
campaign can be sustained.<br>
<p>
MOSCOW POLICE DETAIN ATTACKER OF U.S. SECURITY OFFICER. Moscow police have<br>
detained a woman who is accused of having splashed gasoline on a U.S.<br>
security guard in the Embassy in Moscow and tried to set him on fire. No one<br>
was seriously hurt in the October 31 incident. The woman is reported to be<br>
from Baku, capital of Azerbaijan, and her Moscow residence permit is said to<br>
have expired October 25. (Itar-Tass November 4)<br>
<p>
REGIONAL SETBACKS FOR PRO-GOVERNMENT CANDIDATES. In a gubernatorial election<br>
held on Sunday in Pskov oblast in north-eastern Russia, a member of Vladimir<br>
Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic party was elected governor, defeating the<br>
pro-government incumbent. Zhirinovsky spent three days in the region,<br>
canvassing support for his colleague. This is the first gubernatorial<br>
victory for a Zhirinovsky supporter. The pro-government incumbent was also<br>
defeated Sunday in Magadan oblast in Russia's Far East. (Itar-Tass, November 4)<br>
<p>
NEW FOREIGN POLICY COUNCIL? Boris Yeltsin has issued a decree approving the<br>
creation of a Foreign Policy Council within the presidential administration,<br>
Russian sources reported on November 1. The president's foreign policy<br>
advisor, Dmitry Ryurikov, has been named to head the council. It is unclear<br>
how the new body, which will have the status of an independent directorate,<br>
will interact with Russia's Foreign Ministry. (ORT, Interfax, November 1)<br>
<p>
YELTSIN CREATES MILITARY DEPARTMENT IN HIS OFFICE. Russian president Boris<br>
Yeltsin has established the State Military Inspectorate in his office, his<br>
press service announced on November 1. The explanation given was that the<br>
new body would enable the president to execute his responsibilities as<br>
commander-in-chief of the armed forces more effectively. (Interfax, November 1)<br>
<p>
BALTIC APPEALS TO NATO LEAVE FRANCE BLASE. A Latvian delegation headed by<br>
parliament chairman Alfreds Cepanis returned disappointed from talks in<br>
Paris with senior French politicians of various parties. While supportive of<br>
Latvia's admission to the European Union, the French hosts discouraged<br>
Baltic hopes for accession to NATO, dwelt on the need for good relations<br>
with Russia, and seemed to believe that the Baltic states discriminate<br>
against ethnic minorities. Cepanis felt that the French had accepted the<br>
official Russian view. (BNS, November 2)<br>
<p>
BELARUSAN DEFENSE MINISTER DISMISSED. President Aleksandr Lukashenko has<br>
dismissed Defense Minister Lt. Gen. Leanid Maltsau for being drunk during a<br>
reception at which he was unable to read a prepared speech. Some local --<br>
including military -- observers surmise that the president set up the<br>
general, who had reportedly disagreed with Lukashenko over military issues.<br>
Lukashenko has appointed first deputy defense minister and chief of the<br>
general staff, Lt. Gen. Aleksandr Chumakov, as acting minister. (Belaplan,<br>
November 1, 2)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
CHERNOMYRDIN REASSURES PARATROOPERS. Amid reports of mounting tensions<br>
within the armed forced, Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin traveled<br>
to the city of Ryazan on November 1, where he met with disgruntled troops<br>
and cadets from a local airborne forces garrison, as well as with strategic<br>
bomber pilots and workers from a nearby defense plant. Defense Minister Igor<br>
Rodionov, who accompanied Chernomyrdin, told reporters prior to their<br>
arrival that the Prime Minister had decided to make the trip because of his<br>
"deep concern over the state of affairs in the army." Special emphasis,<br>
Rodionov added, would be placed on "the troubled situation surrounding the<br>
Airborne Forces." <br>
<p>
In his remarks to the troops, Chernomyrdin called the government's wage and<br>
payment arrears to the army "inadmissible," and pledged that in October,<br>
November, and December servicemen would receive both the regular wages due<br>
them and unpaid wages for the previous two months. Chernomyrdin, who also<br>
used the meeting to speak out against NATO enlargement, assured the troops,<br>
moreover, that the future of the Airborne Forces is in no doubt. (Itar-Tass,<br>
Interfax, Reuter, November 1) Some soldiers reportedly asked of Chernomyrdin<br>
that a fellow paratrooper be appointed to head the Airborne Forces -- rather<br>
than a Ground Forces officer as has been rumored. That request caused<br>
Rodionov to snap back that they would take orders from whomever is named to<br>
the post. "This is not a collective farm, but an army," Rodionov was quoted<br>
as saying. (Kommersant-daily, November 2) Rodionov has backed a military<br>
reform plan that includes reductions in the number -- and a diminishment in<br>
the role -- of the elite Airborne Forces. <br>
<p>
Chernomyrdin's trip appeared to reflect not only real concern in the Kremlin<br>
over growing unrest in the army, but also the prime minister's continuing<br>
efforts to stand in for the ailing Boris Yeltsin. Since the dissolution of<br>
the Soviet Union the Russian president has carefully cultivated key segments<br>
of the uniformed military, and Chernomyrdin, with one eye on the presidency<br>
himself, has undoubtedly recognized the value of that policy. <br>
<p>
RYBKIN REVIEWS SECURITY COUNCIL APPOINTMENTS. Russian Security Council<br>
secretary Ivan Rybkin told Russian TV on November 1 that Russia's ambassador<br>
in London, veteran diplomat Anatoly Adamishin, is among the candidates for<br>
the post of deputy secretary of the Security Council. Rybkin also said that<br>
Nikolai Mikhailov will carry on as deputy secretary of the Council and that<br>
economist Sergei Glazyev, a close ally of former Security Council secretary<br>
Alexander Lebed, also remains on the staff, although in a less influential<br>
post than before. Lt. Gen. Leonid Maiorov, who was appointed deputy<br>
secretary last week, had served as Rybkin's aide for military matters from<br>
1994-1996, when Rybkin was Duma Speaker. Rybkin said that Vladimir Denisov<br>
and Sergei Kharlamov, who last week lost their posts as deputy secretaries,<br>
had declined an invitation to work as deputies to Rybkin in his capacity as<br>
presidential envoy to Chechnya. <br>
<p>
Rybkin asserted that he had been involved in--and approved--the<br>
controversial decision to appoint Boris Berezovsky as Security Council<br>
deputy secretary. Rybkin said, moreover, that he thought the strong<br>
objections to the appointment voiced by Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznev had<br>
more to do with internal Communist party politics than with Berezovsky's<br>
suitability for the post. Party leader Gennady Zyuganov is believed to have<br>
resented Seleznev's nomination to the "council of four," a group that is to<br>
run the state during Yeltsin's hospitalization. Zyuganov apparently<br>
interpreted the nomination as a de facto elevation of Seleznev to leader of<br>
the Communist party, and pressured Seleznev to find a pretext not to take<br>
part in the council's meetings. (NTV, Interfax, November 1)<br>
<p>
SECURITY COUNCIL TO DEAL WITH RUSSIA-NATO RELATIONS? Several Russian dailies<br>
speculated on November 1 that Russia's Security Council will soon play a<br>
more prominent role in dealings with NATO. The speculation was based on the<br>
statement of an unnamed Security Council official, who said on October 31<br>
that a "well-known diplomat" would soon be appointed to a new deputy<br>
secretary post on the Council, with responsibility for relations between<br>
Russia and NATO. (Kommersant-daily, November 1; see above) That report came<br>
only a day after Rybkin called publicly for Russia to be admitted into<br>
NATO's political structures. Although the proposal had the appearance of an<br>
off-the-cuff remark, a Russian daily on November 1 claimed to have learned<br>
from Kremlin sources that, in fact, it reflected the well-considered<br>
position of some officials within the presidential administration. The<br>
newspaper suggested, moreover, that the Foreign Ministry may have been<br>
by-passed in the formulation and public airing of Rybkin's proposal.<br>
(Nezavisimaya gazeta, November 1; see Monitor, November 1)<br>
<p>
Indeed, Rybkin's remark on NATO appeared to contradict directly a position<br>
set out by Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov in a long article published by<br>
Nezavisimaya gazeta on October 22. There, Primakov described "any talk of<br>
the possible entry of Russia into NATO" as "insidious." (See Monitor,<br>
October 24-25) The possibility that the presidential administration and the<br>
Security Council -- which is subordinate to the president -- could be<br>
emerging as an alternative and competing center of foreign-policy<br>
decision-making was given some credence by the announcement on November 1<br>
that a new Foreign Policy Council will be created within the president's<br>
office (see above). For all of that, the canny Primakov remains widely<br>
respected among Russia's political elite, and his hard-nosed dealings with<br>
the West on NATO enlargement seem still to reflect the consensus view of<br>
Russia's security establishment. <br>
<p>
BEREZOVSKY MEETS CHECHEN LEADERS. On November 2, three days after his<br>
appointment as Security Council deputy secretary, Boris Berezovsky traveled<br>
to the north Caucasus to meet for the first time with leaders of Chechnya's<br>
transition government. The unannounced visit took journalists by surprise.<br>
Berezovsky arrived without an entourage -- even without bodyguards --<br>
underlining his image as an atypical politician. The meeting was held in<br>
Nazran, in the residence of President Aushev of Ingushetia, and went on late<br>
into the night.<br>
<p>
The goal of Berezovsky's visit was to prepare for a meeting between Russian<br>
prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Chechen premier Aslan Maskhadov. In<br>
an interview with NTV before the meeting, Berezovsky said the financing of<br>
Chechen reconstruction was the main item on his agenda, and would also<br>
dominate the discussions when Chernomyrdin travels to Chechnya. (NTV,<br>
November 3) <br>
<p>
In Nazran, Berezovsky met with Chechen first deputy premier Movladi Udugov<br>
and presidential aide Akhmed Zakaev. While the Chechen side made clear that<br>
it saw the Nazran meeting as only a preliminary scouting out of a new<br>
partner, both sides appeared satisfied with one another. Towards evening on<br>
November 3, Berezovsky traveled to Grozny for talks with Maskhadov. These<br>
talks also focused on financing issues and preparations for Chernomyrdin's<br>
visit. Maskhadov told a press conference afterwards that it is now important<br>
to turn to economic questions and that political questions could be examined<br>
in five years' time -- "with a clear head." Udugov expressed satisfaction<br>
that "the Russian side is finally beginning to understand whom it has to do<br>
business with," that is, it is no longer taking Chechnya's nominal<br>
pro-Russian government seriously. (NTV, November 3)<br>
<p>
THE BALTIC STATES<br>
<p>
MOSCOW NOT INTERESTED IN NORMALIZATION WITH ESTONIA. According to Russian<br>
deputy foreign minister Sergey Krylov, "normalization of Russian-Estonian<br>
relations is impossible without cardinal changes in the Estonian<br>
authorities' discriminatory policy toward our compatriots in that country."<br>
That, moreover, will not suffice: Russia "categorically rejects the Estonian<br>
leadership's attempts at joining NATO... and will make clear what the<br>
consequences will be on all aspects of Russian-Estonian relations."<br>
Previewing tomorrow's meeting between Foreign Ministers Yevgeny Primakov and<br>
Siim Kallas, Krylov went out of his way to stress that the Estonians had<br>
requested it and that the Russian side will use the meeting to raise these<br>
two issues. Krylov also dismissed Estonian prime minister Tiit Vahi's<br>
recent, repeated offers to meet his Russian counterpart, Viktor<br>
Chernomyrdin, in Moscow. The political differences are too pronounced,<br>
Krylov said. Krylov's remarks belied his previously stated regret that no<br>
high-level meeting has taken place for the past year and a half. (Interfax,<br>
November 1)<br>
<p>
Moscow has similarly snubbed Latvian prime minister Andris Skele's repeated<br>
and public offers to meet Chernomyrdin in Moscow. Krylov, who is responsible<br>
for "near abroad" affairs, is rightly considered a moderate among Russian<br>
policy makers. His remarks suggest that Moscow remains unreconciled to the<br>
Baltic states' exercise of some basic sovereign prerogatives, which it seeks<br>
to portray as incompatible with normalization of relations with Russia.<br>
<p>
PERENNIAL LEGAL ISSUE SNAGS LATVIAN-RUSSIAN BORDER TALKS. The third round of<br>
Russian-Latvian border delimitation talks, just held in Riga, stumbled<br>
against the Russian side's refusal to acknowledge the validity of the 1920<br>
Russian-Latvian peace treaty from the standpoint of international law, and<br>
the continuity of Latvian statehood during the Soviet occupation period.<br>
Moscow's delegation also rejected as "interference in Russia's internal<br>
affairs" the Latvian side's proposal to discuss compensation for Latvian<br>
property expropriated in Abrene (today Pytalovo) district. That Latvian area<br>
of 1,300 square kilometers was annexed to the Russian Federation following<br>
the Soviet occupation of Latvia--an event described by the Russian<br>
delegation as "Latvia joining the USSR." (BNS, Itar-Tass, November 1) The<br>
situation parallels the Estonian-Russian border talks, which mark time not<br>
because of territorial disputes but because the Russian side considers the<br>
Soviet occupation of Estonia to have invalidated the 1920 Russian-Estonian<br>
peace treaty. <br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
UKRAINE'S NUCLEAR ENERGY SECTOR AWAITS PROMISED WESTERN ASSISTANCE.<br>
Ukrainian prime minister Pavlo Lazarenko has dismissed the director-general<br>
of the Zaporizha nuclear power plant (NPP), and had called to account the<br>
management of the Rivne NPP. He also announced his intention to dismiss the<br>
director-general of the South Ukraine NPP or -- depending on the<br>
investigation in progress there -- the managers of South Ukraine NPP's<br>
suppliers. Six power blocs at those three NPPs had to be disconnected from<br>
the national power grid recently because of technical incidents. The<br>
glitches seriously reduced Ukraine's electricity output and caused a chain<br>
reaction of power failures in the system. None of those incidents posed<br>
radiation risks. The Chernobyl plant for its part operates at half-capacity,<br>
and one of its four power blocs is scheduled to be permanently disconnected<br>
from the national power grid within a month in order to be decommissioned.<br>
(Interfax-Ukraine, November 1 and 2) <br>
<p>
The energy deficit  is one of the factors behind the continuing fall in the<br>
country's industrial production and GDP, as was noted with concern by<br>
President Leonid Kuchma at a meeting with his economic advisers and<br>
employers' association leaders over the weekend. The nuclear sector still<br>
accounts for the lion's share of Ukraine's power output, and can not readily<br>
be replaced by coal-fired plants because of the crisis in the coal mining<br>
sector. The situation underscores the urgency of promised G-7 assistance to<br>
Ukraine's nuclear sector. That assistance is not materializing even as<br>
Ukraine adheres to its own pledge of closing down Chernobyl. <br>
<p>
BELARUSAN OPPONENTS OF LUKASHENKO SHOW STRENGTH IN MINSK. Up to 15,000<br>
supporters of Belarus independence and of its constitution marched through<br>
central Minsk in an All Souls procession which ended with a mourning rally<br>
at the Kuropaty mass graves on the capital's outskirts, where the Soviet<br>
NKVD executed thousands of Belarusans. Prominent parliamentarians attended,<br>
and clergymen of all denominations said prayers. The ceremony was an<br>
affirmation of ecumenism that contrasted with President Aleksandr<br>
Lukashenko's call in a speech the same day to make the Orthodox Church --<br>
subordinate to the Moscow Patriarch -- the state church of Belarus.<br>
Lukashenko for his part laid flowers at the graves of Red Army soldiers and<br>
former Communist leaders of the Belarus SSR. <br>
<p>
In St. Petersburg to attend a CIS meeting, parliament chairman Syamyon<br>
Sharetsky stated that the legislature represents "the main obstacle to the<br>
establishment of a presidential dictatorship" in Belarus; and warned that<br>
the parliamentary majority would resign en masse if Lukashenko succeeds in<br>
getting his draft constitution approved in a referendum. (AP, Belaplan, NTV,<br>
Interfax, November 2, 3) The day showed that the constitutional front,<br>
formed by establishment groups in the parliamentary majority and the<br>
extraparliamentary radical groups, remains solid as the constitutional<br>
confrontation in Belarus advances seemingly toward a climax. <br>

THE FORTNIGHT IN REVIEW<br>
<p>
RUSSIA AND THE WEST: STILL DANCING TO DIFFERENT DRUMMERS<br>
	Clashes between Moscow and Washington on arms control issues meant that, as<br>
regards security policy, the past fortnight opened and closed on sour notes.<br>
In between, the music played only slightly more sweetly, as Moscow inched<br>
grudgingly toward accommodation on NATO enlargement. Inside Russia,<br>
President Boris Yeltsin entered the final stages of preparation for heart<br>
surgery while debate raged over who, if anyone, was running the country.<br>
Meanwhile, in the heart of Europe, the age-old struggle for geopolitical<br>
influence took on new forms.<br>
<p>
STARTING AND STOPPING <br>
	Hopes that the Russian parliament might be convinced to move quickly toward<br>
ratification of the START II Treaty were dashed during U.S. defense<br>
secretary William Perry's October 17 appearance in Moscow before three<br>
parliamentary committees. Reports indicated the questioning was harsh,<br>
particularly from Vladimir Zhirinovsky and members of his so-called Liberal<br>
Democratic party. But even a relative moderate like Vladimir Lukin, head of<br>
the Duma's International Affairs Committee, said chances of ratification<br>
were minimal. Russian objections to the treaty, which was ratified by the<br>
U.S. Senate last January, seemed to center on NATO's planned expansion and<br>
the related but more general sentiment that the West is riding roughshod<br>
over Russia's security interests. Another Duma committee head, retired gen.<br>
Lev Rokhlin, complained that START II would freeze Russia's strategic<br>
inferiority vis-a-vis the West because Moscow does not have the money to<br>
take full advantage of the treaty's limits. Perry's attempts to persuade<br>
deputies that ratification of the treaty would ultimately save Russia money<br>
appeared to fall on deaf ears.<br>
	Russian fears that the U.S. intends to violate the ABM Treaty sounded the<br>
fortnight's second sour note and stoked reluctance to sign on to START II.<br>
On October 30 it was announced that Moscow had canceled at the last moment<br>
the planned signing of a "partial" U.S.-Russian agreement on distinguishing<br>
battlefield from strategic ballistic missiles. The ceremony was to have<br>
formalized a much publicized joint statement signed by Russian foreign<br>
minister Yevgeny Primakov and U.S. secretary of state Warren Christopher on<br>
September 24. That agreement dealt with long-negotiated demarcation criteria<br>
distinguishing between low speed -- or "low side" -- strategic and theater<br>
systems. The Russians apparently decided they were no longer interested in a<br>
partial agreement and would sign nothing until an agreement setting out both<br>
low and "high side" parameters was reached.<br>
<p>
EDGING TOWARD ACCOMMODATION ON NATO <br>
	Russian and Western leaders continued warily to circle each other on NATO<br>
enlargement. President Bill Clinton brought the issue into the U.S.<br>
presidential campaign when he called on October 22 for NATO to accept new<br>
members in time for the alliance's 50th anniversary in 1999. While<br>
reiterating that Moscow would be granted no veto power over NATO's admission<br>
of new members, Clinton pushed for an agreement between Moscow and Brussels<br>
and declared that Russia would be among the beneficiaries of an enlarged<br>
NATO. Moscow's cool reaction to Clinton's speech did not belie the<br>
impression that Russian leaders, despite their continuing bitterness over<br>
NATO's plans, may be moving toward a grudging acceptance of expansion.<br>
Aleksandr Lebed was the most vocal proponent of that position but, following<br>
his ouster, Defense Minister Igor Rodionov and others have also hinted at a<br>
willingness to deal with Brussels. In an article published on October 22,<br>
Primakov said Russia no longer "confines itself to an excessively negative<br>
attitude" toward expansion, and indicated that Moscow was looking instead to<br>
negotiate "rules of conduct" that would suit all parties.<br>
<p>
RUSSIA SPEAKS UP IN THE MIDDLE EAST<br>
	In what Moscow billed as an effort to raise its profile in the Middle East,<br>
Foreign Minister Primakov embarked October 28 on a five-nation tour of the<br>
region. Primakov's visit came in the wake of renewed violence between<br>
Israelis and Palestinians and at a time when U.S.-brokered peace talks had<br>
degenerated into mutual recriminations. Arriving in Egypt on October 30,<br>
Primakov urged Israel to adhere to the "land for peace" principle agreed to<br>
at the 1991 Madrid peace conference, and warned that failure to do so could<br>
provoke a new cycle of violence. But even as Moscow attempted to use its<br>
friendly relations with some of the Arab states to counter Washington's<br>
dominant influence in the region, it professed to see itself challenged for<br>
the main supporting role by the European Union and, particularly, France.<br>
Russian diplomats warned the EU against trying to supplant Russia in the<br>
region, and Primakov found himself denying that his long planned trip had<br>
been launched as a reaction to French president Jacques Chirac's tour of the<br>
region a week earlier.<br>
<p>
POWER VACUUM IN MOSCOW <br>
	Tensions sharpened in Moscow as the countdown continued toward President<br>
Boris Yeltsin's heart surgery. On October 22, Yeltsin canceled all meetings<br>
to undergo medical tests and rest prior to the operation expected to take<br>
place in early November. Anticipating a prolonged absence, Yeltsin tried to<br>
make peace among his squabbling colleagues. In a broadcast October 25, he<br>
reprimanded feuding ministers and told them to pull together or face<br>
dismissal. In place of the headstrong Aleksandr Lebed, Yeltsin appointed<br>
loyalist Ivan Rybkin as Security Council secretary and envoy to Chechnya. On<br>
his first visit to the region, Rybkin assured Chechen leaders that he would<br>
adhere to the peace accords brokered by Lebed. Turning a blind eye to<br>
developments in the breakaway republic, Moscow seemed to be reconciling<br>
itself to eventual Chechen independence.<br>
	As the date for surgery approached, Yeltsin announced the creation of a new<br>
Consultative Council consisting of himself, Prime Minister Viktor<br>
Chernomyrdin, and the speakers of the two houses of the Russian parliament.<br>
Yeltsin's aide Anatoly Chubais was to sit in for Yeltsin while he was in<br>
hospital. This placed Chubais, who admitted that the council was his<br>
brainchild, on an equal footing with the prime minister. The council was<br>
seen both as way of defusing potentially destabilizing conflicts between<br>
Chernomyrdin and Chubais and as a means of involving the Communist-dominated<br>
parliament in running the state. <br>
	At first, the council was warmly welcomed by parliamentary leaders. But<br>
before the "permanent four" could hold their first meeting, controversy<br>
erupted over Yeltsin's appointment of Boris Berezovsky, a banker and media<br>
mogul, as deputy secretary of the Security Council. Berezovsky is president<br>
of the LogoVAZ banking group and sits on the board of Russia's<br>
semi-privatized Public Television (ORT). He was one of a group of six<br>
financiers who put up $3 million to bankroll Yeltsin's reelection campaign<br>
in the summer. (Another member of the group, banker Vladimir Potanin, was<br>
appointed first deputy prime minister after the election.) Berezovsky is<br>
commonly described as a member of the "Chubais clan" of "Westernisers," as<br>
opposed to (among others) the oil and gas clan headed by Chernomyrdin and<br>
the now discredited military-industrial clan centered on disgraced<br>
presidential bodyguard Aleksandr Korzhakov. One key difference between the<br>
clans is the varying extent to which they want to open Russia up to<br>
competition from the world economy.<br>
	Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznev protested vehemently against Berezovsky's<br>
appointment. Saying he was sure Chubais was behind it, Seleznev demanded<br>
Chubais' resignation and said he would not participate in the "permanent<br>
four" as long as Chubais remained. Russian commentators concurred that<br>
Berezovsky's appointment was evidence that Chubais' "clan" had gained the<br>
upper hand in the Kremlin. Yeltsin's sickness meant he was no longer able to<br>
maintain the balance between competing clans and presidential rivals.<br>
Chubais, they wrote, was forming "a shadow cabinet" that represented a<br>
potential challenge to the official cabinet led by Chernomyrdin. Conflict<br>
between the premier and the new, within-Kremlin opposition seemed only a<br>
matter of time.<br>
<p>
RUSSIA: A WEAK STATE <br>
	Communist party leader Gennady Zyuganov capitalized on the disarray by<br>
demanding Yeltsin's resignation: "The president cannot steer the ship, which<br>
is sailing in stormy seas almost without fuel and with the officers fighting<br>
on the bridge," Zyuganov declared. But preoccupation with Kremlin intrigues<br>
sometimes obscured the real weakness of the Russian state and the fact that<br>
the Kremlin's writ often extends little further than the Moscow ring-road.<br>
In recent months, conflicts between the Kremlin and the regions have<br>
frequently resulted in defeat for the federal center. Last week, it was the<br>
turn of Tatarstan. The federal government, acutely embarrassed by its<br>
inability to collect federal taxes (as a result of which the IMF announced<br>
that it was withholding the October tranche of its extended loan to Russia),<br>
published a hit-list of companies which it accused of persistently failing<br>
to pay up. Outcry met the news that one of the companies on the list was the<br>
Kama Truck Plant, located in the Volga republic of Tatarstan which jealously<br>
guards its autonomy from Moscow. Moscow's "high-handed" behavior,<br>
"reminiscent of the [Brezhnev] era of stagnation," was furiously denounced<br>
by Tatarstan's president Shaimiev who flew to Moscow to get the decision<br>
reversed. Moscow may be able to browbeat firms in less assertive regions.<br>
But its loss of face in the Kama affair was an object lesson for those who<br>
forget that, in some arenas, the Kremlin is little more than one of a number<br>
of gangs competing for influence over Russia's increasingly differentiated<br>
regions.<br>
<p>
STRUGGLE FOR THE HEART OF EUROPE<br>
	The collapse of the USSR did not, of course, end the East-West contest. It<br>
did however move the main focus of that contest from west-central to<br>
east-central Europe. The fault-line runs today between the Baltic and the<br>
Black Seas, through the regions once described by Oscar Halecki as the<br>
"borderlands of western civilization." Those borderlands are now independent<br>
countries, but the former metropolis still seems unreconciled to their<br>
permanent independence. <br>
Russia's Foreign Ministry reacted angrily to three recent resolutions of the<br>
U.S. House of Representatives. These called for promoting Baltic security<br>
(short of admitting the three states to NATO), supporting Ukraine's<br>
independence, and encouraging the withdrawal of Russian troops from Moldova.<br>
The Russian Foreign Ministry blasted the resolutions as "prejudiced and<br>
unfriendly toward Russia" and condemned Congress for "passing judgment on<br>
the countries of the former USSR and instructing them how to manage their<br>
relations." "We do not," the Foreign Ministry went on, "accept any<br>
interference in our relations with neighboring countries... To play a<br>
constructive role in U.S.-Russian relations, Congress should revise its<br>
attitude to CIS integration." A textbook illustration of Moscow's claim to a<br>
sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, the statement recalled post-World War<br>
II pronouncements rejecting outside interference in Soviet relations with<br>
its neighbors. The statement added weight to recent assertions by Foreign<br>
Minister Primakov and other Russian officials that Moscow's attitude to the<br>
West will depend on Western and, in particular, U.S. acceptance of<br>
Russia-led "integration" of the ex-Soviet space.<br>
	The struggle over the borderlands has taken different forms in Ukraine,<br>
Belarus and Moldova. In Ukraine, it revolves around the Black Sea Fleet and<br>
its Crimean bases, protracted negotiations over which entered a new and<br>
perhaps final phase this fortnight. Some Ukrainian officials gave signs of<br>
tiring of the constant, uphill effort to assert national interests while<br>
defusing political tensions with Russia and locally, and negotiating for<br>
Russian fuel deliveries and debt relief besides. Russia's Duma increased the<br>
pressure on Kiev through two resolutions, one mandating a Russian grab of<br>
the still-undivided Black Sea Fleet and the other claiming Sevastopol for<br>
Russia. <br>
	Although Russia's Foreign Ministry distanced itself from the two Duma<br>
resolutions, many pro-government and even democratic deputies voted in favor<br>
or failed to oppose them; and Prime Minister Chernomyrdin called the Duma's<br>
action a warning to Kiev to relent on the fleet and the bases. Moreover,<br>
Chernomyrdin reiterated that the fleet dispute must be resolved before the<br>
signing of the long-delayed interstate treaty between Russia and Ukraine,<br>
which Kiev sees as a means of securing final and definitive Russian<br>
recognition of Ukraine's borders. In a demonstration of Ukraine's will to<br>
settle the fleet dispute, Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma rushed to Moscow<br>
to meet with an ailing President Yeltsin and offer a number of additional<br>
concessions.<br>
	Claims that Sevastopol is Russian territory, made against the backdrop of<br>
Yeltsin's illness by presidential aspirants Aleksandr Lebed and Yury<br>
Luzhkov, heightened Kiev's sense of urgency. As Kuchma put it, Kiev's "sole<br>
wish" at this point is to settle the fleet dispute and sign the political<br>
treaty. Kiev seems convinced, perhaps correctly, that it ought to get such a<br>
deal as is available while Yeltsin is still in power, since Moscow could<br>
become more intractable under Yeltsin's prospective successors. Accordingly,<br>
Kiev indicated willingness to lease naval bases to Russia for 20 years and<br>
to settle for Ukrainian basing rights in only one of Sevastopol's five bays.<br>
It was perhaps these and other concessions that precipitated the<br>
resignation, on the eve of Kuchma's visit to Moscow, of no fewer than three<br>
Ukrainian admirals. Negotiations are now supposed to be completed within the<br>
next two weeks.<br>
	The Black Sea Fleet means not only ships but, more importantly, a vast if<br>
crumbling coastal infrastructure, one of the world's most strategic<br>
locations, and an opportunity for Russia to secure a bridgehead on Ukrainian<br>
territory. A Russian military presence in Crimea could fuel Russian<br>
irredentism, keep Kiev under political pressure, encourage centrifugal<br>
trends in other parts of Ukraine, and give Russia a lever over the strategic<br>
calculations of Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania and Moldova. <br>
	Russian troops are already entrenched in Moldova. Moscow denies being bound<br>
by Chernomyrdin's signature on a 1994 bilateral agreement to withdraw its<br>
troops from Moldova. This October, all the leading candidates in Moldova's<br>
upcoming presidential election -- incumbent Mircea Snegur, Speaker Petru<br>
Lucinschi and Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli -- were in Moscow for talks<br>
with Chernomyrdin and other Russian officials. Each of the three was seeking<br>
assurances -- without specifying a time-table -- that the troops would<br>
eventually be withdrawn. In a break with precedent, however, Chernomyrdin<br>
announced that he had conferred with Transdniester leader Igor Smirnov, who<br>
acts as host to Russian troops in the breakaway Moldovan region. Smirnov was<br>
in Moscow to attend a Duma committee meeting which finalized a bill giving<br>
Russian troops in Moldova the status of forces permanently stationed abroad.<br>
The Speaker of the upper house of the Russian parliament, Yegor Stroyev,<br>
indicated that Russia has not abandoned its traditional view of Moldova as<br>
Russia's southern border when he declared that "Russian-Moldovan common<br>
interests were determined as long ago as the reign of Peter the Great...<br>
They include the southern borders and the common economic space for which<br>
many generations have spilled much blood." Stroyev's view of Moldova as<br>
Russia's southern border by right of conquest is shared by Russian<br>
nationalists, Communists and Transdniester leaders but is not usually voiced<br>
by responsible officials. It must have set alarm bells ringing in Kiev,<br>
since it implies Russian reabsorption of Ukraine, which lies between Russia<br>
proper and its "southern border" in Moldova. <br>
	In Belarus, Moscow does not need not to use pressure to secure political<br>
influence and military reentry. President Aleksandr Lukashenko seeks in his<br>
own original fashion to return Belarus to Russia's political and military<br>
orbit by presidential fiat, preparatory to outright unification. Lukashenko<br>
needs discretionary powers in order to overcome resistance to his project.<br>
He has drafted a new constitution which would give him those powers and<br>
called a referendum to get his draft approved. His moves, which violate the<br>
constitution currently in force, are being resisted by parliament and the<br>
Constitutional Court. <br>
	The Constitutional Court has the power to stop the issue going to a<br>
referendum. This past fortnight, Lukashenko has threatened to dissolve both<br>
parliament and the Constitutional Court if they continue to resist his<br>
plans. The president controls the state administration, security services<br>
and mass media, and exudes confidence that the referendum will go his way.<br>
He also has the support of various levels of the Russian government from<br>
Yeltsin down. Even as he opened what seems to be the final stage of his<br>
confrontation with the legislature and the Court, Lukashenko was received by<br>
the top Russian leaders amid heavy media exposure. Official Russia needs and<br>
uses Lukashenko not just in Belarus but as a catalyst of integration in the<br>
CIS. Moscow holds up the Yeltsin-Lukashenko treaty creating a Russia-Belarus<br>
Community as an example for other CIS countries to follow, and threatens<br>
military countermeasures in Belarus as a means of discouraging NATO enlargement.<br>
	At the same time, influential elements in the Russian government have<br>
recently signaled their alarm at the heavy economic cost political<br>
unification with Belarus would impose on Russia. Moscow is also<br>
uncomfortable about some of Lukashenko's tactics and has tried to convince<br>
him that a merger of Belarus and Russia will be counterproductive if it is<br>
seen as undemocratic and imposed from above, or if it provokes serious<br>
social divisions. Official Moscow therefore wants Lukashenko to bring the<br>
legislature or at least a substantial part of it on board before he pursues<br>
his policy of "integration" with Russia. The Kremlin has accordingly advised<br>
Lukashenko to defuse the confrontation, offer parliament token concessions,<br>
and obtain the consent of the legislature before proceeding with his<br>
constitutional referendum.<br>
	Meanwhile, Lukashenko and his military officials have intensified contacts<br>
with their Russian counterparts on unifying air defense and border troops,<br>
preparatory to a possible military alliance that would entail stationing<br>
Russian troops in Belarus. Such a development would have far-reaching<br>
security implications for Belarus' neighbors. It would turn Poland into a<br>
front-line state, envelop the flanks of Latvia and Lithuania, and leapfrog<br>
Ukraine. Ukraine could find itself with Russian forces in Crimea to the<br>
east, in Transdniester to the south, and in Belarus to the west. <br>
	Lukashenko's main political opponent, Chairman of Parliament Syamyon<br>
Sharetsky, has warned that dictatorship is on the march in his country. But<br>
the stakes in Belarus transcend that country and carry implications for the<br>
post-Soviet balance of power in the heart of Europe.<br>

DUMA DEPUTIES CALL FOR MORATORIUM ON DEATH PENALTY. Russian Duma speaker<br>
Gennady Seleznev and International Affairs Committee chairman Vladimir Lukin<br>
have appealed to President Boris Yeltsin to declare a moratorium on the<br>
death penalty in Russia. (NTV, October 29) When Russia joined the Council of<br>
Europe in February, it undertook to abolish the death penalty within three<br>
years, and the Council called for a moratorium on executions until abolition<br>
became law. About 200 people are believed to have been executed in Russia<br>
annually in the last five years. (Komsomolskaya pravda, July 30) <br>
<p>
CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST CHECHEN SEPARATISTS MAY SOON BE CANCELED. Criminal<br>
charges against Chechen opposition leaders Zelimkhan Yandarbiev, Aslan<br>
Maskhadov, and Movladi Udugov may soon be canceled. According to Duma Deputy<br>
Speaker Mikhail Gutsiriyev, the Duma at its next session on November 10 will<br>
debate an amnesty for participants in armed conflicts in Chechnya. The<br>
amnesty would cover Russian troops who deserted from the federal forces but<br>
would not include people accused of premeditated murder, banditry, and other<br>
serious crimes. (Itar-Tass, Echo Moskvy, October 29)<br>
<p>
NO RUSSIAN-NATO AGREEMENT THIS YEAR. NATO secretary-general Javier Solana<br>
yesterday denied that the Western alliance seeks to sign a cooperation<br>
agreement with Moscow by the end of this year. A Russian news agency had<br>
quoted Solana to that affect a day earlier. (See Monitor, October 30) In<br>
remarks made during a visit to Stockholm, Solana said he sees talks with<br>
Russia on future relations as an ongoing process that he hopes will<br>
culminate in an agreement in mid-1997. (AP, Reuter, October 30)<br>
<p>
LUKASHENKO RENEWS THREAT TO USE FORCE. Belarus president Aleksandr<br>
Lukashenko yesterday threatened again to "take measures" and "defend the<br>
people" if the Constitutional Court sides with the parliament by ruling that<br>
the referendum planned for November 24 contravenes the existing<br>
constitution. Escalating the war of nerves, Lukashenko warned the justices<br>
against "losing their heads for good," and said that a court ruling in<br>
parliament's favor would give him "the legal basis for dissolving the<br>
legislature." The Court is scheduled to consider the case tomorrow.<br>
(Interfax, October 30)<br>
<p>
NO APPARENT MOVEMENT IN BLACK SEA FLEET TALKS. On October 29-30 a Russian<br>
delegation headed by Deputy Prime Minister Valery Serov and the naval<br>
commander-in-chief, Adm. Feliks Gromov, held talks in Sevastopol and<br>
Feodosia with Ukrainian counterparts. The talks focused on the partition of<br>
the Black Sea Fleet's coastal assets and on the conditions for leasing naval<br>
bases on Ukrainian territory. Statements by both sides yesterday evening<br>
suggested that little if any progress was made. Two further rounds of talks<br>
are now scheduled for early November, first in Moscow and then in Kiev.<br>
(Russian and Ukrainian agencies, October 30)<br>
<p>
TAJIK-CANADIAN VENTURE GRINDS TO A HALT. The Canadian company Nelson Gold<br>
Corp. is indefinitely suspending, effective today, its participation in the<br>
Zeravshan Gold joint venture in Jilau, northwestern Tajikistan. Nelson<br>
Gold's affiliate Commonwealth and British Minerals has a 49 percent share<br>
(to the Tajik government's 51 percent) in that gold-mining and processing<br>
project. The Canadian firm cites the Tajik government's failure to meet a<br>
multitude of contractual obligations, including those pertaining to banking<br>
operations and taxation. (Interfax, October 29)<br>
<p>
NEW KAZAKH DEFENSE MINISTER. Kazakh president Nursultan Nazerbaev yesterday<br>
appointed Mukhtar Altynbaev as defense minister, replacing Col. Gen. Alibek<br>
Kasimov. Altynbaev had been chief of the air force. Kasimov was said to have<br>
left "for health reasons." The previous day, Nazerbaev appointed Maj. Gen.<br>
Beksultan Sarsekov secretary of the republic's Security Council, replacing<br>
Baltash Tursumbaev. (Interfax-Kazakhstan, October 30, Itar-Tass October 29)<br>

CHERNOMYRDIN REJECTS SELEZNEV'S ULTIMATUM. Russian prime minister Viktor<br>
Chernomyrdin has reacted with anger to yesterday's threat by Duma speaker<br>
Gennady Seleznev to boycott meetings of the new "permanent four"<br>
consultative body, which was due to meet today for the first time.<br>
Complaining that the row threatens to disrupt plans for managing the country<br>
during President Yeltsin's upcoming surgery and recuperation, Chernomyrdin<br>
called for "unity, not people playing games." in order to deal with the<br>
country's many serious problems. (BBC World Service, October 31; Interfax,<br>
October 30) <br>
<p>
Seleznev declared yesterday that he would boycott the meeting unless<br>
presidential aide Anatoly Chubais resigned his post. Chubais, Seleznev said,<br>
was responsible for the appointment of banker and financier Boris Berezovsky<br>
as deputy secretary of Russia's powerful Security Council. Seleznev accused<br>
Chubais of usurping power during Yeltsin's sickness and of handing state<br>
power over to a clique of bankers and financiers that had bankrolled<br>
Yeltsin's election campaign this past summer. <br>
<p>
COMMUNISTS SUPPORT SPEAKER'S STANCE, OTHERS WAVER. Seleznev's opposition to<br>
the Berezovsky appointment was applauded by Gennady Zyuganov on behalf of<br>
the Communist faction in the Duma. Other Duma faction leaders also deplored<br>
the appointment, including leaders of the Yabloko and "Russia is Our Home"<br>
deputy groups. But some non-Communist Duma leaders expressed disquiet over<br>
Seleznev's one-sided decision to boycott today's meeting of the Consultative<br>
Council. They seemed disturbed over Seleznev's decision to decide<br>
unilaterally over whether or not the Duma should be represented on such an<br>
important body. (RTR, October 30) <br>
<p>
Chernomyrdin said he saw "nothing remarkable" in Berezovsky's appointment.<br>
He pointed out that the Security Council is a consultative body and<br>
described as a positive step the recruitment of top businessmen to advise<br>
the president and the government. (Interfax, October 30) Security Council<br>
secretary Ivan Rybkin also distanced himself from Seleznev's position. He<br>
said Berezovsky would give up his commercial activities as long as he served<br>
on the Security Council and that his responsibilities would include finding<br>
sources of finance for the reconstruction of war-torn Chechnya. At a time<br>
when the state coffers are empty, Rybkin said, it is necessary to find<br>
"non-traditional" sources of finance. Rybkin also disagreed with Seleznev's<br>
depiction of Berezovsky's activities as "anti-Russian," saying he disliked<br>
the "subtext" of such epithets. (RTR, October 30) <br>
<p>
In an interview with today's Financial Times, Berezovsky talked openly of<br>
his role in the election campaign. He said he agreed with a group of other<br>
businessmen last spring that Russia's fledgling private sector faced "mortal<br>
danger" from a possible Communist victory. A 10-member campaign team was<br>
established that included Yeltsin's daughter Tatyana Dyachenko and that was<br>
headed by Chubais. Berezovsky agreed he is a controversial figure, but<br>
attributed this to his reputation for plain-speaking and his views on issues<br>
such as privatization. (Financial Times, October 31)<br>
<p>
RUSSIA BALKS AT MISSILE AGREEMENT. U.S. undersecretary of state Lynn Davis<br>
will not be flying to Geneva today as planned to sign a "partial agreement"<br>
with her Russian counterpart on how to distinguish missiles capable of<br>
shooting down battlefield ballistic missiles from those that can down<br>
strategic missiles because the Russians canceled the event at the eleventh<br>
hour. On September 24 Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov and U.S.<br>
secretary of state Warren Christopher had signed a joint statement on the<br>
subject, and called for the agreement to be formalized today. The two had<br>
agreed that missiles with speeds of 3 kilometers per second and less would<br>
not violate the 1972 ABM treaty. The two sides have been working for years<br>
on a "demarcation" agreement between strategic systems and so-called theater<br>
systems, and the latest Primakov/Christopher agreement was one covering  the<br>
"low side" of the problem--hence the "partial." The negotiators then were to<br>
renew their efforts to agree on the "high side" specifications, hopefully<br>
defining missiles whose speed might approach but still not reach that needed<br>
to intercept the fast-moving strategic missiles. The Russians now say that<br>
nothing will be signed until both the low and high parameters are agreed,<br>
i.e., no partial agreement. (Voice of America, October 30)<br>
<p>
Today's signing would in any event have been more form than substance, as<br>
the two sides have really never had any serious disagreements over the slow<br>
missiles. It is the high-speed interceptors that have and continue to cause<br>
all the trouble. As U.S. secretary of defense William Perry discovered when<br>
he recently tried to convince Duma legislators to ratify the START-II<br>
nuclear disarmament treaty, (See Monitor, October 18) the Russians are<br>
especially sensitive about the ABM treaty and what many perceive as<br>
Washington's determination to abandon it by creating a nation-wide ABM<br>
system. Moscow has never been eager to modify the ABM treaty in any way and<br>
today's non-event is another indication that it plans to drag out the<br>
demarcation talks as long as possible.<br>

PRIMAKOV IN EGYPT. Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov, fresh from<br>
visits to Syria and Lebanon, arrived in Egypt yesterday and immediately<br>
called upon Israel to adhere to the "land for peace" principle agreed to at<br>
the 1991 Madrid peace summit. A failure to observe that principle could<br>
provoke renewed violence in the region, Primakov warned following talks with<br>
Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak. (Reuter, October 30) Primakov has launched<br>
his Middle East trip with the intention of raising Russia's profile in the<br>
region, and Mubarak suggested that Moscow does have a role to play in the<br>
peace process there. The Soviet Union was a co-sponsor of the 1991 Madrid<br>
conference. <br>
<p>
Meanwhile, in remarks of his own made yesterday in Cairo, Washington's envoy<br>
to Israel tried to defuse tensions between the U.S. and the two other<br>
outside players -- Russia and the EU -- suddenly competing for a peacemaking<br>
role in the region. Ambassador Martin Indyk said that the U.S. welcomes<br>
Russian and European support in its efforts to get the peace process back on<br>
track in the Middle East, but he cautioned that "to have more than one<br>
facilitator" could greatly complicate the situation in the region. Both<br>
Russia and the EU -- and especially France -- have intimated that peace<br>
talks have stalled because of what they say is Washington's one-sided<br>
support for Israel. But tensions between Moscow and the Europeans have also<br>
cropped up. Speaking in Beirut prior to his departure for Cairo, Primakov<br>
denied press reports that his current trip to the region is a reaction to<br>
French president Jacques Chirac's recent visit to the Middle East. Earlier,<br>
Russian diplomats had suggested that France and the EU are trying to<br>
supplant Russia as a player in the region. (Interfax, Reuter, October 30)<br>
<p>
MOSCOW BACKS DOWN IN CONFRONTATION WITH TATARSTAN. The Russian government<br>
has backed down from its threat to start bankruptcy proceedings against the<br>
KamAZ truck plant for alleged non-payment of federal taxes. The government<br>
of the Republic of Tatarstan, where KamAZ is based, had responded furiously<br>
to the Kremlin's threat, describing it as senseless, destructive, and<br>
contradictory to the power-sharing treaty signed by the republic and the<br>
federal center in 1994. Tatarstan's president, Mintimer Shaimiev, traveled<br>
to Moscow for talks with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on the issue.<br>
After that meeting, Shaimiev told journalists with satisfaction that the<br>
federal center would not be in hurry to take "one-sided decisions" relating<br>
to Tatarstan in the future. (Interfax, October 29) Tatarstan may have scored<br>
a victory, but the publicity over the affair may yet serve the Russian<br>
government's purposes by attracting attention to the problem of non-payment<br>
and frightening other, less powerful, enterprises into paying up. <br>
<p>
CALL FOR MILITARY POLICE FORCE. A representative of the Russian General<br>
Staff, Lt. Gen. Vladimir Kulakov, said yesterday that the Defense Ministry<br>
was proposing the creation of a military police force to serve as the single<br>
law-enforcement structure for all of Russia's military and armed forces. He<br>
estimated that some 10,000-12,000 servicemen would have to be recruited into<br>
the new branch. The process would take about a year once the enabling<br>
legislation was in place, he said, adding that a draft law was being<br>
circulated. Nikolai Karpov, a spokesman for the Duma's Defense Committee,<br>
said that the committee and the Defense Ministry agreed that the branch<br>
should be placed under control of the General Staff. (Interfax, October 30)<br>
<p>
Such subordination has not been well received in the other ministries<br>
potentially involved, and has not always been the position of the Duma<br>
committee itself. It drafted a bill earlier this year that called for an<br>
independent military police force to be "detached from the armed forces" and<br>
accountable to the president and the Federal Assembly. (Rabochaya tribuna,<br>
July 7)The original Duma bill had also called for a strengthening of the<br>
Federal Security Service's role in the prevention and investigation of<br>
crimes in the military. (See Monitor, July 11)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
UKRAINE TO PROVIDE MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO TURKMENISTAN. The defense<br>
ministers of Ukraine and Turkmenistan, Aleksandr Kuzmuk and Danatar Kopekov,<br>
signed yesterday in Ashgabat two agreements on cooperation between their<br>
ministries. The agreements envisage, inter alia, Ukrainian assistance in the<br>
technical maintenance and overhauling of Turkmenistan's armored and other<br>
military equipment, training of Turkmen cadets in Ukrainian military<br>
schools, and instruction of Turkmen air force and air defense officers by<br>
the corresponding Ukrainian military services, both in Ukraine and in<br>
Turkmenistan. Kuzmuk also conferred with Turkmen president Saparmurad<br>
Niazov. (Interfax-Ukraine, October 30) The Ukrainian minister went to<br>
Turkmenistan rather than attending the CIS Defense Ministers' Council<br>
meeting in Dushanbe. There, Deputy Minister Ivan Bizhan represented Kuzmuk<br>
in successfully resisting several major Russian proposals. Turkmenistan<br>
declined to attend the Dushanbe meeting. (See Monitor, October 30)<br>
<p>
Kiev has also concluded military assistance agreements with Georgia and<br>
Uzbekistan in recent months. Such agreements are motivated not only by<br>
commercial considerations but also by Ukraine's political goal -- shared by<br>
some other CIS member countries -- of reducing Russia's role as a source of<br>
military and technical assistance. Ukraine is well equipped to service the<br>
CIS countries' Soviet-era arsenals. <br>
<p>
THE CAUCASUS<br>
<p>
KARABAKH TALKS AT IMPASSE IN RUNUP TO OSCE SUMMIT. Interviewed on Armenian<br>
television, Karabakh president Robert Kocharian restated a series of terms<br>
"from which there can be no retreat and no fallback positions" for settling<br>
the conflict with Azerbaijan. Karabakh will "never" be a part of Azerbaijan<br>
or subordinated to Baku, he said, nor accept being an enclave. Karabakh will<br>
itself determine its security needs and maintain its own army. Karabakh is<br>
not interested in any level of autonomy within Azerbaijan because it is, de<br>
facto, independent, Kocharian noted. He added that meaningful negotiations<br>
within the framework of the OSCE's Minsk Group can only begin when its<br>
member countries and Azerbaijan accept those conditions. (Armenpress,<br>
Noyan-Tapan, October 29 and 30) <br>
<p>
Kocharian is set to win a second term of office in Karabakh's presidential<br>
election, scheduled for November 24. His remarks were an indirect response<br>
to recent U.S., Russian, and OSCE statements that criticized the planned<br>
election as untimely and likely to complicate the peace negotiations.<br>
(Turan, October 28 and 29)<br>
<p>
Baku insists on unconditional observance of its territorial integrity and<br>
inviolability of its borders, including retrocession of the Lachin corridor,<br>
which had made Karabakh an enclave inside Azerbaijan before the war.<br>
Azerbaijan offers Karabakh "the highest degree of autonomy" as part of<br>
Azerbaijan, and security guarantees for what would once again become "the<br>
Armenian community in Azerbaijan." Armenia for its part takes the position<br>
that it will accept any settlement terms that are acceptable to Karabakh.<br>
The incompatibility of the sides' positions on these and other issues seems<br>
to preclude the progress that the OSCE is currently pressing for and still<br>
hopes to see at its upcoming annual summit. <br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
JAPANESE LENDING TARGETS INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS. The Japanese government<br>
yesterday announced its decision to lend 15.5 billion yen (more than $140<br>
million) to Uzbekistan for expanding and modernizing the airports of<br>
Bukhara, Samarkand, and Urgench. Uzbekistan hopes to attract international<br>
tourism to the historical monuments in these cities, which were once<br>
political and cultural centers of the Muslim and Turkic world, situated on<br>
the ancient Silk Road. Earlier this year, Japan lent 6 billion yen (more<br>
than $50 million) to Uzbekistan for overhauling its rolling stock. Last year<br>
Tokyo lent 13 billion yen (approximately $120 million) to Uzbekistan for<br>
developing its telecommunications system. (Western agencies, October 30) <br>
<p>
Also yesterday, donor countries and international financial agencies<br>
involved in aiding and crediting Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan<br>
opened a meeting in Tokyo. Japan is considering lending 20 billion yen to<br>
Kazakhstan and 10 billion yen to Kyrgyzstan in the current fiscal year to<br>
support infrastructure projects. The Japanese government and business<br>
circles hope to begin importing substantial amounts of Central Asian fuels<br>
and materials within the next few years, and are interested in the growth of<br>
international investments in the region. Accordingly, they also support the<br>
development of these countries' transportation and communications systems.<br>

CORRECTION: In the item on Russia's state budget debate, yesterday's Monitor<br>
incorrectly identified Argumenty i fakty as the source of a quotation by<br>
Russian first deputy minister of finance Vladimir Petrov. In fact, the<br>
source was Interfax. <br>

NEWS:<br>
<p>
YELTSIN CANCELS ADDRESS; ZYUGANOV DEMANDS NEW ELECTIONS. Russian president<br>
Boris Yeltsin will not make his usual radio address this week in line with<br>
his doctors' recommendation to cancel all official activities in advance of<br>
his surgery. Yeltsin's doctors will meet Monday to set the date of the<br>
operation. (Interfax, October 31) Russian Communist party leader Gennady<br>
Zyuganov seized on the cancellation to demand Yeltsin's resignation and<br>
fresh presidential elections. "The president cannot guide the ship, which is<br>
sailing in stormy seas almost without fuel and with the officers fighting on<br>
the bridge," Zyuganov told a news conference yesterday. (Reuters, October 31)<br>
<p>
CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL TO MEET NEXT WEEK, WITHOUT SPEAKER. Russia's new<br>
Consultative Council will hold its first meeting early next week,<br>
presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky announced yesterday. He<br>
said the meeting will take place without Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznev, who<br>
is refusing to participate in protest against Boris Berezovsky's appointment<br>
to the Russian Security Council. The Speaker of the upper house of the<br>
Russian parliament, Yegor Stroyev, said he will attend the meeting. (ORT,<br>
October 30) Meanwhile, liberal economist Yegor Gaidar, commenting yesterday<br>
on rumors that he has been invited to join the Security Council, said he had<br>
received no such invitation and would not accept it if he had. (NTV, October 31)<br>
<p>
SCIENTISTS APPEAL TO RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT. Nuclear scientists in Russia called<br>
on the Russian government yesterday to take urgent steps to fund scientific<br>
research establishments. The call was in response to the apparent suicide of<br>
a leading nuclear weapons scientist, Vladimir Nechai. The 60-year-old Nechai<br>
headed Russia's second largest nuclear research institute in the formerly<br>
secret city of Chelyabinsk-70 in the Urals. He was found dead in his office<br>
late Wednesday. Colleagues said he was under stress since workers on his<br>
staff had not been paid for five months. (ORT, BBC, Interfax, October 31)<br>
<p>
GAZPROM TO ENTER EUROBOND MARKET. Russia's natural gas giant, Gazprom, plans<br>
to become the first Russian company to enter the eurobond market. Gazprom's<br>
move will follow soon after the Russian sovereign bond issue planned for<br>
later this month, the Financial Times reports today. The paper quotes<br>
Finance Minister Aleksandr Livshits as saying the Russian government plans<br>
to press ahead with the eurobond issue despite uncertainty over President<br>
Yeltsin's health and last week's decision by the IMF to withhold the latest<br>
tranche of its extended loan to Russia. (Financial Times, November 1)<br>
<p>
PRIMAKOV REASSURES ISRAELIS. Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov, in<br>
the midst of a high-profile trip to the Middle East, assured Israelis<br>
yesterday that Syria is not preparing a military strike against them.<br>
Primakov visited Damascus earlier this week. Primakov, who has long placed<br>
the blame for the stalled Middle East peace process on Israel, also said<br>
that Moscow would not support Syria -- or "any party that uses force" -- in<br>
the event that it launches a strike on Israel. (Reuter, October 31)<br>
<p>
CALL FOR A BIGGER RUSSIAN PEACEKEEPING FORCE IN THE BALKANS. Just back from<br>
a four-day trip to the Balkans, Russian Defense Council secretary Yury<br>
Baturin said on October 30 that he favors increasing the number of Russian<br>
troops participating in any future international peacekeeping operation in<br>
the region. Baturin also called for an expansion of the geographic zone of<br>
responsibility currently being overseen by Moscow's 1,500 man IFOR<br>
contingent in eastern Bosnia. (RIA, October 30)<br>
<p>
JAPANESE MILITARY WORRIED ABOUT RUSSIAN FLIGHTS TO HOKKAIDO. The Japanese<br>
Self Defense Force wants to study a proposal that would allow Russian<br>
airline flights in and out of the civilian airport of Sapporo, on the<br>
northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. The airport is right next to a<br>
strategic military airbase and an electronic intelligence listening post<br>
that monitors communications in Russia, China and Korea. On those infrequent<br>
occasions in the past when Russian charter flights have landed at Sopporo,<br>
the military has temporarily shut down its radars and antennas. (Itar-Tass,<br>
October 31)<br>
<p>
DOGFIGHT TO SELL FIGHTERS TO SOUTH KOREA. Russian, U.S., and European<br>
aircraft producers, all attending a South Korean air show last week, were<br>
said to be competing intensely for a piece of Seoul's multi-billion dollar<br>
air defense modernization program. Reports described the McDonnell Douglas<br>
Corp.'s F-15E, Dassault Aviation's Rafale, Russia's Sukhoi Su-35, and the<br>
Eurofighter 2000 as top contenders for the contract. South Korea plans<br>
acquire 120 aircraft by the year 2010. (Reuter, October 28)<br>
<p>
IMF MISSION TO LITHUANIA. The third IMF mission to Lithuania this year has<br>
concluded its work. IMF officials declared that no final conclusions will be<br>
drawn until a new government is formed by the Conservative party, which won<br>
the elections on October 20. A central topic in the discussions between IMF<br>
officials and Lithuanian authorities was the plan announced by the<br>
conservatives to end the currency board system. The IMF believes that a<br>
quick unpegging of the lit: dollar relationship could provoke financial<br>
instability. (Baltic News Service, October 31) <br>
<p>
UKRAINE GETS FIRST MAJOR JAPANESE INVESTMENT. Japan's Mitsui Corporation and<br>
associates have signed an agreement to modernize Ukraine's Kremenchug<br>
oil-processing plant at a cost of 20 billion yen (about $180 million). The<br>
project, credited by the Japanese state, represents the largest Japanese<br>
investment in Ukraine to date. (Western agencies, October 31. See Monitor,<br>
October 31, on a surge of Japanese investment in Central Asia)<br>
<p>
GEORGIA RETURNS GERMAN CULTURAL VALUABLES. At a ceremony in Berlin, Georgia<br>
returned to Germany approximately 100,000 books looted by the Red Army from<br>
libraries in Berlin, Luebeck, Hamburg, Bremen, Leipzig, and other German<br>
cities after World War II. German foreign minister Klaus Kinkel described<br>
the restitution as voluntary and unconditional. (German agencies, October<br>
30) Russia holds an incomparably larger share of the loot, and its<br>
government is resisting German demands for restitution.<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
CHECHENS "SATISFIED" WITH BEREZOVSKY APPOINTMENT. According to Chechen<br>
information minister Movladi Udugov, the Chechen government learned of<br>
financier Boris Berezovsky's appointment to the Security Council "with<br>
satisfaction." Deputy Premier Ruslan Kutaev said Berezovsky's appointment<br>
could presage Russian investment in the Chechen economy. (NTV, October 31)<br>
However, ousted Security Council secretary Aleksandr Lebed has alleged that<br>
Berezovsky urged him to continue the war in Chechnya because it suited<br>
Berezovsky's business interests. Lebed told a press conference on October 17<br>
that Berezovsky had said he did not care how many people were killed during<br>
the war as long it was good for business. (Kommersant-weekly, October 22)<br>
<p>
The row over Berezovsky's appointment in the Russian media has turned ugly.<br>
Journalist Pavel Voshchanov, who in 1991 served as President Yeltsin's press<br>
secretary, yesterday openly questioned Berezovsky's loyalty to the Russian<br>
state on the grounds that he is Jewish. (Komsomolskaya pravda, October 31)<br>
There was also a clear anti-Semitic undertone in Duma Speaker Gennady<br>
Seleznev's charge that Berezovsky had "staged an anti-Russian information<br>
coup on Public TV." (Itar-Tass, October 29) Russian commentators concurred<br>
with Voshchanov's evaluation of Berezovsky's appointment as "proof that<br>
Chubais' clan has gained the upper hand in the Kremlin." Writing in<br>
Kommersant-daily, Georgy Bovt and Natalya Kalashnikova said that the<br>
appointment marked "the formation of a shadow cabinet in the Kremlin," led<br>
by presidential aide Anatoly Chubais, and that it represented a potential<br>
challenge to the cabinet of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.<br>
(Kommersant-daily, October 31) The evolution of both government and<br>
opposition within the executive branch is the logical result of Russia's<br>
1993 constitution, which emasculated parliament and vested almost all power<br>
in the hands of the executive.<br>
<p>
KULIKOV MEETS WITH CHECHEN INTERIOR MINISTER. Russian interior minister<br>
Anatoly Kulikov conferred in Moscow earlier this week with his Chechen<br>
counterpart, Kazbek Makhashev. The meeting took place in secret and<br>
journalists learned of it only after Makhashev had returned home. Kulikov<br>
said Makhashev had come to Moscow at his invitation in order to discuss<br>
"forming a new ministry." (Interfax, October 31) Order is currently being<br>
maintained in Chechnya only by the Chechen rebel fighters, who are<br>
implementing not the Russian criminal code but that of Chechnya-Ichkeria,<br>
based on Islamic law. Under Chechen law, the penalty for drinking or selling<br>
liquor is caning, while adultery is punishable by stoning. Moscow seems to<br>
have given up trying to persuade Chechen leaders to implement Russian law,<br>
and looks merely to persuade them to be moderate in their application of<br>
Islamic law. Kulikov admitted that the Chechen criminal code has not been<br>
abolished but, he said, judges will in future be more selective in<br>
sentencing criminals and "nobody will be chopping anybody's hands off any<br>
more." (Interfax, October 31)<br>
<p>
The demilitarization of Chechnya was also on the agenda. Despite earlier<br>
protests from the Kremlin, Security Council secretary Ivan Rybkin has said<br>
Moscow will recognize the elections to be held in Chechnya on January 27, as<br>
long as the republic is demilitarized by that time. (Interfax, October 28)<br>
Moscow knows it is unrealistic to expect the Chechen resistance forces to<br>
disarm, but will apparently look the other way. Kulikov claimed that Chechen<br>
premier Aslan Maskhadov has forbidden rank and file soldiers to bear arms.<br>
"This is a quite serious step. They understand that they can't hold<br>
legislative elections while the people are still armed. I think our partners<br>
are doing all they can to hold truly democratic elections in the republic,"<br>
Kulikov said. (Interfax, October 31) Less than a month ago, Kulikov was<br>
describing the Khasavyurt accords as "treason" and the Chechen leaders as<br>
"bandits." (Interfax, October 2) His change of tone suggests that the<br>
Kremlin is reconciling itself to Chechnya's secession from Russia and trying<br>
to make the best of an unwelcome situation.<br>
<p>
CONCILIATORY COMMISSION CONTINUES BUDGET TALKS. The Conciliatory Commission<br>
on the Russian 1997 federal budget, made up of representatives from the<br>
legislative and executive branches, has yet to reach a consensus. After its<br>
first meeting on October 30, Russian finance minister Aleksandr Livshits<br>
told reporters that the government is ready to introduce some changes in its<br>
proposals and that a slight increase in the budget deficit would be<br>
acceptable.(Russian Business TV, October 31) But Mikhail Zadornov, chairman<br>
of the Duma's budget committee, criticized the government for failing to<br>
include the Duma's recommendations in the revised budget. He also said that<br>
the budget deficit should be increased from the current proposed level of<br>
3.3 percent of GDP to  3.5 percent. The deputy chairman of the budget<br>
committee, Gennady Kulik, urged a greater increase in the deficit, to 4.5-5<br>
percent of GDP. (Interfax, 30 October) <br>
<p>
The chairman of the Duma Committee for Economic Policy, Yuri Maslyukov,<br>
charged that the government's draft budget does not meet conditions for<br>
economic growth. He proposed that a budget should be approved only for the<br>
first quarter, during which time work should continue on a 3-year program of<br>
budget reform. (Russian Business TV, October 31) Livshits dismissed that<br>
proposal and warned that it could have negative affects on financial<br>
markets. (Interfax, October 30) According to Duma speaker Gennady Seleznev,<br>
the commission will conclude its work in 4-5 sessions with the signing of a<br>
joint protocol. Matters that elude consensus will then be discussed in the<br>
Duma.(Russian Business TV, October 31) The conciliatory commission did agree<br>
during talks yesterday on the introduction in 1997 of a new tax on<br>
transactions in securities. (Interfax, October 31) <br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
YET ANOTHER ASSURANCE FROM BELARUS ON STRATEGIC MISSILES. Reacting to the<br>
Council of Europe's recently expressed concern that Belarus might not rid<br>
itself of the remaining ex-Soviet strategic nuclear missiles on its<br>
territory by the end of 1996, as it had promised, Deputy Foreign Minister<br>
Mikhail Khvostov told a Minsk news conference yesterday that the transfers<br>
would indeed take place. However, his choice of references was ambiguous at<br>
best. Khvostov stressed that Belarus would meet the deadline set by the 1992<br>
Lisbon Protocol. (Interfax-West, 31 October) But that agreement, which<br>
involved the U.S., Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, merely commits<br>
Belarus to abide by the 7-year schedule in the START-I treaty. That period<br>
ends in 2001. The 1996 deadline was one agreed to later bilaterally by the<br>
Belarussians and the Russians.<br>
<p>
The withdrawal issue has more recently degenerated into a three-way squeeze<br>
play involving Washington, Minsk, and Moscow, with time running out. The<br>
U.S. -- and presumably Russia -- want the missiles out, while Minsk wants<br>
money or at least some form of substantial compensation in return. Belarus<br>
has received relatively small amounts of cash from the U.S. and Germany to<br>
help it dismantle launch pads and for environmental clean-ups. But Moscow is<br>
apparently unwilling or unable to pay Belarus the price Minsk wants in order<br>
to get its last 18 SS-25 mobile missiles back. <br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
MOSCOW HOLDS OUT CARROT TO GEORGIA FOR MILITARY BASES. Lt. Gen. Leonid<br>
Ivashov, head of the Russian General Staff's International Military<br>
Cooperation Directorate, told a Moscow briefing yesterday that Russia plans<br>
to resume "military-technical cooperation" with Georgia. Moscow had<br>
suspended cooperation because of the Georgian parliament's refusal to ratify<br>
the agreement on Russian bases in Georgia. However, Moscow has now decided<br>
that resumption of the program "could stimulate an early ratification of the<br>
agreement," Ivashov said. Moreover, Moscow has granted Tbilisi's demand that<br>
both sides, not just Moscow, nominate the new commander of Russian<br>
"peacekeeping" forces in Abkhazia. Georgian president Eduard Shevardnadze<br>
will screen and interview candidates for the post. Ivashov suggested that<br>
the decision was made at the October 29 meeting of CIS countries' defense<br>
ministers. (Interfax, October 31; see Monitor, October 30, and Central Asia<br>
section below)<br>
<p>
The "military-technical cooperation" evidently implies the transfer of<br>
Russian hardware and other equipment to Georgian forces. Modest in scale yet<br>
crucial to a Georgian army that is being built from scratch, the program had<br>
been presided over by former Russian defense minister Pavel Grachev and his<br>
Georgian counterpart, Vardiko Nadibaidze, and rested in large measure on<br>
their close personal relationship. Grachev's ouster and Tbilisi's series of<br>
indignant protests against Moscow's policy in Abkhazia apparently caused<br>
Moscow to suspend the program briefly.<br>
<p>
The bilateral agreement on Russian military bases in Georgia was signed in<br>
1994, but Shevardnadze has steadfastly conditioned Georgian ratification on<br>
Russian support for the restoration of Georgia's territorial integrity. He<br>
and the parliament recently warned that Russia's military presence in<br>
Georgia lacks a legal basis and, absent ratification, Georgia may terminate<br>
it. Tbilisi has been highly critical of the commander of Russian<br>
"peacekeepers" in Abkhazia, Lt. Gen. Vasily Yakushev, who has opposed<br>
Georgian proposals to task his troops with securing the repatriation of<br>
Georgian refugees. Shevardnadze has also threatened to terminate the mandate<br>
of that force if it continues shielding Abkhaz gains.<br>
<p>
Moscow's concessions as announced by Ivashov are modest but significant, and<br>
mark a switch from stick to carrot. They seem to reward, at least for the<br>
moment, Shevardnadze's gamble of appearing to offer ratification of the<br>
agreement on military bases in exchange for tangible Russian military<br>
support. But mutual mistrust will in any case probably continue to permeate<br>
the relationship through its ups and, mostly, downs.<br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
MOSCOW'S CALL FOR COLLECTIVE RESPONSE FINDS FEW TAKERS. According to Lt.<br>
Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head of the Russian General Staff's International<br>
Military Cooperation Directorate, participants of the October 29 meeting in<br>
Dushanbe of CIS countries' defense ministers had concluded that "the actions<br>
of the USA and other countries are having an extremely negative impact on<br>
the southern borders of the CIS." Ivashov told a Moscow briefing that the<br>
meeting had agreed that "the Central Asian countries and Russia face a<br>
security threat." They also reviewed "external threats" in other CIS areas,<br>
he said. Ivashov suggested that the meeting's participants had agreed to<br>
commission plans for "collective actions in various theaters to repel<br>
possible aggression... A common response to aggressors would involve ground<br>
force, naval, and air operations." (Interfax, October 31) <br>
<p>
Ivashov was probably attempting to present Russia's own position and a<br>
narrowly based agreement among several countries loyal to Moscow as a<br>
consensus of the defense ministers' meeting. In fact, several countries<br>
declined to attend and some of those attending turned down major Russian<br>
proposals (See Monitor, October 30). Moscow obviously regards the recent<br>
escalation of the Afghan conflict as an opportunity to rally at least some<br>
CIS governments behind the Russian concept of "coalitional forces" in<br>
individual theaters. That concept is a substitute for Moscow's earlier,<br>
stillborn plans to create some type of CIS joint forces. Few governments<br>
appear convinced at this stage. Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, each<br>
of whom has a few hundred soldiers on the Tajik-Afghan border, remain<br>
manifestly reluctant to increase that token number. Oddly, Belarus president<br>
Aleksandr Lukashenko has offered to send troops to reinforce "CIS borders"<br>
in Central Asia. <br>

YELTSIN MAY BE OPERATED ON NEXT WEEK. President Boris Yeltsin's heart<br>
surgery may take place as early as next week. American heart specialist<br>
Michael DeBakey, who will supervise the operation, told the BBC in an<br>
interview today that the risk of failure in Yeltsin's case was "normal" for<br>
such operations, "2, 3, 4 percent," and that, if successful, Yeltsin could<br>
look forward to ten years' healthy working life. A Kremlin spokesman said<br>
Yeltsin's doctors will meet next week to set the date. (BBC World Service,<br>
October 30)<br>
<p>
CHUBAIS WANTS TO ASSERT CONTROL OVER RUSSIA'S REGIONS. Presidential Chief of<br>
Staff Anatoly Chubais says that most of Russia's problems stem from the<br>
weakness of the state. He was addressing a conference in Moscow yesterday on<br>
the observance (or lack of observance) of federal laws by local governments.<br>
Chubais said a stop must be put to a situation where many of Russia's<br>
regions have promulgated laws that contradict federal legislation. In<br>
reality, the center has few levers with which to influence the regions.<br>
Chubais called for the creation of a new body that would monitor regional<br>
legislation and sound the alarm when it did not conform to federal laws<br>
(Itar-Tass, RTR, October 29)<br>
<p>
GENERAL STAFF REORGANIZATION. The Russian General Staff is going to reduce<br>
the number of its "Main" directorates from 16 to 4, according to a<br>
"well-informed source" in the Defense Ministry. The four will be:<br>
Operations, Intelligence (GRU), Organization and Mobilization, and<br>
Personnel. The 12 others will be downgraded to "Central" directorates, with<br>
a corresponding reduction in billets. Other staffs, including those in the<br>
ministry, the military districts, and the fleets will also be cut by 15<br>
percent. (Itar-Tass, 29 October)<br>
<p>
NEW STATE PRIZE FOR WEAPONS DESIGNERS. Russia may not be able to pay its<br>
soldiers and workers in arms factories, but it is going to award a cash<br>
bonus each year to outstanding weapons designers. Named after Marshal Georgy<br>
Zhukov, the prize will amount to 1,500 times the minimum wage. Candidates<br>
can be nominated only after their work has been tested in production or put<br>
into service. (Itar-Tass, 29 October)<br>
<p>
RUSSIA, IRAN SPONSOR REGIONAL CONFERENCE ON AFGHAN SETTLEMENT. An<br>
international conference on settling the Afghanistan conflict opened<br>
yesterday in Tehran. Russia, four Central Asian countries, China, and India<br>
are attending. The U.S., Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia have<br>
declined to participate. Apparently, no Afghan authority or group will<br>
attend. Russia and Iran, both of which oppose the Taliban and support<br>
deposed Afghan leaders Burhanuddin Rabbani and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, have<br>
promoted this conference. (Western and Russian agencies, October 29)<br>
<p>
MISSION OF THE IMF IN UKRAINE. A mission of the IMF arrived yesterday in<br>
Ukraine to review the performance of the Ukrainian economy under the terms<br>
of the current stand-by program. Discussions with the government on a<br>
memorandum to apply for new resources within the framework of an Extended<br>
Financing Facility (EFF) will also take place. Ukraine expects to obtain<br>
$2.5-3 billion if an agreement is reached. (TV Channel Business Russia, 29<br>
October) In a recent conference held in Paris on 24-26 October, donor<br>
countries, including Russia, pledged their support to the Ukrainian reform<br>
program. According to an adviser to the Ukrainian president, financing needs<br>
for 1997 are around $3 billion. (Interfax, 29 October)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
AMAZEMENT AND OUTRAGE GREET BANKER'S APPOINTMENT TO RUSSIA'S SECURITY<br>
COUNCIL. The speaker of the lower house of Russian parliament, Gennady<br>
Seleznev, has strongly protested yesterday's appointment of a prominent<br>
Russian banker, Boris Berezovsky, as deputy secretary of Russia's powerful<br>
Security Council. (Itar-Tass, October 29) Berezovsky is president of the<br>
LogoVAZ banking group and heads the board of directors of Russia's<br>
semi-private Public Television (ORT). He is believed to have bankrolled<br>
President Yeltsin's reelection campaign last summer. Recently, Berezovsky<br>
has been accused by both ousted Security Council secretary Aleksandr Lebed<br>
and former presidential bodyguard Aleksandr Korzhakov of conniving with<br>
presidential aide Anatoly Chubais to persuade President Yeltsin to oust them<br>
from their Kremlin posts.<br>
<p>
However true these unedifying charges might be, the appointment of a banker<br>
and media mogul to one of Russia's most powerful and sensitive bodies is an<br>
extraordinary development. It bears out suspicions that Lebed's ouster was<br>
not caused merely by a clash of personalities, but rather involved a<br>
struggle of clans seeking control over the machinery of the state.<br>
Berezovsky told Itar-Tass yesterday that he expects to be responsible on the<br>
Security Council for issues relating to economic reform. Seleznev left no<br>
doubt that he believes Chubais is behind the appointment. Seleznev demanded<br>
Chubais' resignation and said that he would not participate in the<br>
Consultative Council of Russia's top four officials as long as Chubais<br>
remains. (Itar-Tass, October 30) Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said<br>
yesterday that the newly-established council will hold its first meeting<br>
tomorrow. (Itar-Tass, October 29) The council includes the president<br>
(represented by Chubais), the prime minister, and the speakers of both<br>
houses of parliament. Earlier this week, Chubais admitted that the idea of<br>
setting up the council was his. (Kommersant-daily, October 29) <br>
<p>
CONCILIATORY COMMISSION TO DISCUSS NEW GOVERNMENT BUDGET PROPOSALS. A<br>
revised 1997 federal budget draft, prepared by the Russian government<br>
following the Duma's refusal to approve a previous version, will be<br>
discussed today by a conciliatory commission that includes representatives<br>
of the legislative and executive branches. In the new budget version,<br>
expenditures and revenues have been reduced by the same amount, and now<br>
stand at 523.5 and 432.8 trillion rubles, respectively. The planned deficit<br>
remains the same, at 90.7 trillion rubles or 3.3 percent of Russian GDP.<br>
According to Russia's Goskomstat, the deficit target level for 1996 is 3.85<br>
percent, while the actual value for the first eight months of the year is<br>
4.2 percent. (Interfax, 29 October) The first deputy minister of finance,<br>
Vladimir Petrov, said that a smaller deficit, as promised by President<br>
Yeltsin, is not possible without putting at risk the payment of wages from<br>
the federal budget. (Argumenty i fakty, 29 October) <br>
<p>
The reduction in revenues in the new version results from the introduction<br>
of tax advantages for culture-related institutions and diminished VAT rates<br>
for the press and publishing houses. A separate expenditure allocation for<br>
military reform -- 6.5 trillion rubles or 12 percent of the defense budget<br>
-- has been established, while resources devoted to defense conversion have<br>
been increased by 500 billion rubles. A fund to support export-oriented<br>
enterprises, to which 500 billion rubles are devoted, has also been<br>
introduced in the new draft. However, planned expenditures can only be<br>
carried out if enough resources are gathered, which raises some doubts given<br>
past difficulties in collecting taxes. <br>
 <br>
The speaker of the Duma, Gennady Seleznev, declared on October 28 that the<br>
changes introduced by the government are only cosmetic, and that the<br>
promises of Russia's president and prime minister to increase expenditures<br>
in social protection and productive investment have been unfulfilled.<br>
According to the chairman of the Duma Budget Committee, Mikhail Zadornov,<br>
the only significant change in the new draft proposal is the increase in<br>
expenditures for the Defense Ministry. (Nezavisimaya gazeta, October 29) <br>
<p>
Criticisms to the government draft budget have also come from regional<br>
leaders in Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, Lipetsk, Samara, Sverdlovsk,<br>
Khanty-Mantsi and Yamal-Nenets -- all of which make positive net<br>
contributions to the federal budget. They have demanded that the budget be<br>
reoriented to promote the development and autonomy of the subjects of the<br>
federation. (Interfax, 29 October) If the new budget draft is finally<br>
approved by the Duma, submission to the Council of the Federation will<br>
follow. More arguments on budgetary appropriations are likely to arise<br>
there, not least because the revised budget draft has reduced the level of<br>
federal support to the regions. (TV Channel Business Russia, 29 October) <br>
<p>
CHERNOMYRDIN TO FOCUS ON ECONOMIC QUESTIONS IN TALKS WITH CHECHEN LEADERS.<br>
Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin intends to visit Chechnya and<br>
meet with leaders of the Chechen opposition before the republic holds its<br>
January 27 elections. (Interfax, October 29) Vladimir Zorin, chairman of the<br>
Duma's Committee on Nationalities, told the Monitor that Chernomyrdin<br>
intends to focus on economic issues and to continue the discussions begun by<br>
Ivan Rybkin when he met with Chechen prime minister Aslan Maskhadov last<br>
weekend in Ingushetia. Maskhadov assured Rybkin that his government would<br>
allow safe and unobstructed passage of train cargoes through Chechnya.<br>
(Interfax, October 28) The oil pipeline which passes through Chechnya will<br>
be another topic for discussion. "After all, if oil stops flowing through<br>
Chechnya, it won't just hurt us. It will hurt the Chechens too!" said Zorin.<br>
Restoring Chechnya's destroyed infrastructure, and payments to those who<br>
have suffered as the result of Russian military actions, will also be<br>
discussed. <br>
<p>
Although Russia has not refused in principle to repair damage done by its<br>
army in the republic, the two sides differ sharply on this question. Chechen<br>
president Zelimkhan Yandarbiev is demanding $100,000 in compensation to<br>
every family that lost a member as the result of military operations.<br>
Experts estimate that as many as 100,000 people have died in Chechnya, and<br>
Zorin says Russia is in no position to pay that kind of money. "If<br>
Yandarbiev poses the question in this way, then we will demand compensation<br>
for the flight of ethnic Russians from the republic during Djohar Dudaev's<br>
tenure, and for the terrorist acts committed in Budennovsk and Kizlyar,"<br>
Zorin told the Monitor. "But," he continued, "I don't think that it will<br>
come to that. While Chechnya is still in a state of preelection euphoria,<br>
the federal authorities do not intend to sign any agreements with the<br>
republic's new leadership."<br>
<p>
Chernomyrdin's "get acquainted" visit to Chechnya is not likely to be<br>
darkened by serious conflict with the republic's new leadership. But, if<br>
Moscow wants to reach agreement with Chechen leaders on the transport of oil<br>
and railroad freight through the republic, it will have to close its eyes to<br>
the fact that Chechnya has already become, de facto, an independent state.<br>
<p>
NATO LEADER CALLS FOR AGREEMENT WITH RUSSIA. NATO secretary-general Javier<br>
Solana has suggested to a Russian news agency that the Western alliance will<br>
seek to conclude an agreement on future relations with Russia by the end of<br>
this year. Interfax quoted the NATO leader as saying that he would endeavor<br>
to "achieve a firm agreement suitable to both Russia and NATO" and that he<br>
was optimistic the agreement could be signed as early as late 1996. Solana<br>
said that the type of agreement -- a charter or a treaty -- is not so<br>
important at present, but that the document is likely to be comprised of<br>
three components: "a declaration, a mechanism for consultation, and a<br>
mechanism for collaboration." Solana also offered Moscow assurances that<br>
NATO has no intention of stationing nuclear weapons in any new member state,<br>
and he suggested that Moscow's concerns over the extension of NATO's<br>
military infrastructure eastward might be alleviated by unspecified<br>
adaptations in the CFE Treaty. (Interfax, October 29)<br>
<p>
According to a Russian security council official, Solana's remarks were an<br>
indication that the Western alliance now supports an earlier call by Russian<br>
president Boris Yeltsin - -made on September 28 -- for NATO to conclude an<br>
agreement with Moscow prior to admitting new members. The official also<br>
named two conditions that are likely to be at the center of negotiations<br>
between Moscow and Brussels on enlargement: the "non-deployment of nuclear<br>
arms in new NATO countries" and a "ban on the location of troops of other<br>
NATO members" on the territories of new member-states. The official<br>
suggested that an interdepartmental working group drawn from the Foreign<br>
Affairs Ministry, the Security Council, and various "power" structures and<br>
Duma committees would participate in the drafting of any potential agreement<br>
between Russia and NATO. (Itar-Tass, October 29) Western leaders have<br>
insisted to date that a political agreement between NATO and Russia would<br>
confer upon Moscow neither a veto power over new members nor voting rights<br>
on alliance matters, a consideration not mentioned in Interfax's report of<br>
Solana's remarks. <br>
<p>
CIS AFFAIRS<br>
<p>
CIS DEFENSE MINISTERS' MEETING: A DUD IN DUSHANBE. A regular meeting of the<br>
CIS Council of Defense Ministers, held yesterday in Dushanbe, deliberated<br>
amid some empty seats and rejected several major Russian proposals. The<br>
meeting marked an inauspicious debut for Russian defense minister Gen. Igor<br>
Rodionov as chair of the CIS defense agency.<br>
<p>
Moldova, Turkmenistan, and, apparently, Uzbekistan failed to attend the<br>
meeting, while Ukraine was there only as an observer and limited its<br>
participation to issues affecting its own interests. A majority of the<br>
delegations in attendance rejected Moscow's proposal to appoint General<br>
Mikhail Kolesnikov as head of the CIS Military Cooperation Staff, arguing<br>
that his predecessor had also been a Russian and that the post must not be<br>
monopolized by Russia. The Ukrainian delegation's head, Deputy Defense<br>
Minister Gen. Ivan Bizhan, stated that Ukraine will not participate in CIS<br>
"peacekeeping" operations, but only those under UN or OSCE auspices. The<br>
Ukrainian and other delegations also turned down a Russian proposal to<br>
create a CIS organ for coordinating the CIS countries' participation in<br>
NATO's Partnership for Peace program. They pointed out that such<br>
participation is governed by national programs agreed upon by individual<br>
countries with NATO. Most delegations did approve a plan of measures to<br>
equip and maintain a CIS air defense system, which most countries view<br>
primarily as a business proposition that could boost under-utilized<br>
industrial capacities. <br>
<p>
The situation in Afghanistan and on the Tajik-Afghan border was a major<br>
topic. Some unspecified countries - very probably the Central Asian --<br>
endorsed a proposal to prolong the mandate of "CIS peacekeeping" forces in<br>
Tajikistan. Some -- again unspecified -- ministers supported the formation<br>
of "regional and subregional security systems" in fulfillment of the draft<br>
CIS collective security concept. Tajik president Imomali Rahmonov, together<br>
with the Russian delegation, urged approval of that proposal. There was no<br>
word on the agenda item regarding the mandate of Russian "peacekeepers" in<br>
Abkhazia and the appointment of a new commander of that force--a point of<br>
controversy between Russia and Georgia. The meeting ended after a half-day,<br>
instead of the day-and-a-half originally set aside for it. (Interfax,<br>
Itar-Tass, October 29)<br>
<p>
The rejection of Kolesnikov leaves the CIS Military Cooperation Staff<br>
headless. Its former chief, General Viktor Samsonov, was named recently to<br>
Kolesnikov's former post as head of Russia's General Staff. Moreover, the<br>
Cooperation Staff has also lost its deputy head, Col. Gen. Leonid Mayorov,<br>
who was yesterday appointed to the post of deputy secretary of Russia's<br>
Security Council. <br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
LUKASHENKO THREATENS FORCE. Belarus president Aleksandr Lukashenko warned in<br>
a speech yesterday that he would "use his right to dissolve the parliament"<br>
if it rescinds the constitutional referendum he wants held on November 24 or<br>
if the Constitutional Court rules against holding it. Lukashenko also warned<br>
that "a civil war would begin" if the referendum fails to approve his draft<br>
constitution. Claiming that a 1995 referendum had given him the right to<br>
dissolve the parliament, Lukashenko accused the legislature, its chairman<br>
Syamyon Sharetsky personally, and the Constitutional Court of "destabilizing<br>
the country" by opposing the expansion of Lukashenko's presidential powers.<br>
Also yesterday, the state press published an appeal by Lukashenko to the<br>
people in which he claimed that the October 19-20 "Belarus people's<br>
assembly" -- made up of his supporters -- had mandated the referendum. The<br>
appeal also threatened a "decisive rebuff to provocations of the political<br>
adventurists and destructive forces" who oppose his draft constitution.<br>
<p>
Lukashenko yesterday also signed decrees ordering the presidential newspaper<br>
Sovetskaya Belorussiya (still so named) to publish more than 7 million<br>
copies of his draft constitution and directing the government to organize<br>
the November 24 referendum using state assets, offices, transportation<br>
means, and mass media. (Interfax, Belaplan, October 29)<br>
<p>
The parliament has in fact proposed a "zero solution" that would discard the<br>
presidential and the parliamentary constitutional drafts, rescind the<br>
referendum, and maintain the existing constitution. The Constitutional Court<br>
supports that solution. It has indicated that it views the proposed<br>
referendum as unconstitutional and is about to issue a ruling on the matter.<br>
The Court has thus far found 17 presidential decrees unconstitutional. The<br>
Central Election Commission has also called for rescinding the referendum.<br>
It argues that the executive branch has unlawfully undertaken to organize<br>
and finance the referendum, bypassing the CEC and the parliament, which are<br>
legally empowered to carry out those functions. Lukashenko wants a<br>
controlled referendum so as to be able to claim popular support for the<br>
establishment of a personal regime.<br>

<p>
YELTSIN CANCELS ALL MEETINGS. Russian president Boris Yeltsin has canceled<br>
all business meetings, and preparations for his heart surgery have entered<br>
the final phase. This does not mean that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin<br>
has already taken over the duties of head of state, presidential spokesman<br>
Sergei Yastrzhembsky stressed yesterday. In other words, Yeltsin wants to<br>
hold onto the nuclear button until the last minute. (RTR, October 28)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN BUDGET GETS UNETHUSIASTIC RECEPTION. The Russian government has<br>
submitted a new draft of the 1997 federal budget for consideration on<br>
October 30 by a joint government/parliament conciliation commission. Duma<br>
Speaker Gennady Seleznev immediately dismissed the draft, calling the<br>
changes "cosmetic" and predicting that passage through parliament will be<br>
difficult. (RTR, October 28) The chairman of the Duma's Budget Committee,<br>
Mikhail Zadornov of Yabloko, said that only a few of the changes were<br>
significant. These include increases in the military budget and in the sums<br>
earmarked for military reform, conversion, and housing for military<br>
personnel. (Interfax, October 28)<br>
<p>
MODEST SUCCESS FOR KREMLIN IN LOCAL ELECTIONS. The gubernatorial elections<br>
held on October 27 in six Russian regions were only modestly successful for<br>
the Yeltsin government, which is keen to see Yeltsin-appointed incumbents<br>
reelected. Incumbents were reelected in only two of the six regions -- Chita<br>
oblast and the Khanty-Mnsi Autonomous okrug. Three regions (Stavropol krai,<br>
Kaluga oblast and the Aga-Buryat Autonomous okrug) will have to hold runoff<br>
elections because no clear winner emerged. In Krasnodar krai, the election<br>
was invalidated by low voter turnout and will have to be held again in three<br>
months time. (RTR, October 28)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN-INDIAN POWER PLANT, AIRCRAFT DEAL. Russia's foreign trade minister<br>
indicated yesterday that Moscow and New Delhi are close to an agreement on<br>
construction of a 2,000-megawatt nuclear power plant in southern India. Oleg<br>
Davydov said that Russia would offer India credit both to finance this<br>
project and to purchase 40 Russian Su-30 fighter planes. During a visit to<br>
New Delhi last week Russian defense minister Igor Rodionov discussed but<br>
failed to close the deal on the aircraft. (Reuter, October 28)<br>
<p>
STILL NO PAY FOR MOST SOLDIERS. Despite the recent assurances from the<br>
Finance Ministry, money does not seem to be making its way into the pockets<br>
of the Russian Ground Forces. A military source reported yesterday that<br>
troops in all 8 military districts had not received salaries for August,<br>
September, and October while those in three of these districts were also<br>
still waiting for their July pay. (Interfax, 28 October)<br>
<p>
SENIOR NATO OFFICIAL PREDICTS EVENTUAL BALTIC ACCESSION. A leading Moscow<br>
daily cites Christopher Donnelly, special assistant to the NATO<br>
secretary-general, as saying in an interview that the alliance has "already<br>
decided in principle that it should admit Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania."<br>
Russian opposition will not block that process because "the Baltic states<br>
are eager to join the alliance as full members, and NATO may not<br>
artificially prevent them. The alliance is open to all who want to join it."<br>
(Nezavisimaya gazeta, October 25)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN PRIME MINISTER TO PLAY LARGER ROLE IN CHECHEN PEACE PROCESS. Russian<br>
prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin plans to visit Chechnya in the near<br>
future and to meet with Chechnya's provisional government. This subject was<br>
discussed during Chernomyrdin's meeting yesterday with Ivan Rybkin, Russia's<br>
security council secretary. Rybkin said the meeting also focused on the<br>
possibility of an amnesty for all participants in the conflict and the<br>
creation of a free economic zone in Chechnya, similar to those already<br>
operating in Ingushetia and Kaliningrad oblast. Rybkin said Chernomyrdin<br>
supported both ideas and that the prime minister's participation "is<br>
becoming necessary at this stage of the peace process." (Ekho Moskvy, ORT,<br>
Interfax, October 28) <br>
<p>
Unlike his predecessor Aleksandr Lebed, the cautious Rybkin has no desire to<br>
take full responsibility for settling the Chechen crisis. Lebed had also<br>
tried, without success, to involve the top leadership in the process, but<br>
Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin were careful to maintain their distance. Now that<br>
Moscow has an envoy it trusts, Chernomyrdin seems more willing to assume a<br>
key role in the peace process. Chernomyrdin met with Chechen president<br>
Zelimkhan Yandarbiev when Lebed was still Security Council secretary (see<br>
Monitor, October 4), and his role will certainly become even more<br>
significant following the appointment of the much less headstrong Rybkin,<br>
who does not have close personal contacts with the separatist leaders.<br>
<p>
CHERNOMYRDIN: JUST A COUNTRY BOY. As Yeltsin prepares for major surgery,<br>
Russian Television is recasting Viktor Chernomyrdin's image, presumably with<br>
an eye to the possibility that the prime minister may take over the<br>
president's functions. With all the subtlety of a sledgehammer, Independent<br>
Television (NTV) last night screened a saccharine profile of the prime<br>
minister. "I'm just a country lad at heart," Chernomyrdin told viewers. <br>
<p>
Showing Chernomyrdin at home with his family, the profile described his<br>
Siberian Cossack roots, his fondness for Siberian pelmeny (dumplings), and<br>
his passion for hunting (after which he enjoys "a drop of vodka").<br>
Chernomyrdin's fondness for driving fast cars was attributed to his father's<br>
work as a chauffeur, and although his penchant for Armani suits is world<br>
famous, viewers were told that his wife buys his clothes. The prime minister<br>
was described as arriving home from work at midnight but never missing his<br>
nightly ritual of drinking tea in the kitchen with his wife, who tells him<br>
what the grandchildren have done all day. When Mikhail Gorbachev was a<br>
member of the Politburo, he and his wife used to walk the Moscow streets at<br>
night to escape the listening devices as Gorbachev told Raisa about the<br>
day's developments. But Chernomyrdin reportedly "never discusses politics at<br>
home." Asked to identify his strong suit, the prime minister replied<br>
"Kindness." "Have you any faults?" asked the interviewer. "Looking at pretty<br>
girls" the prime minister admitted. (NTV, October 26)<br>
<p>
NAVY FINDS A FRIEND IN MOSCOW MAYOR. The first in the new Boreas-class of<br>
Russian ballistic-missile submarines is to be named the Yuri Dolgoruki after<br>
the traditional founder of the city of Moscow, Prince Yuri Dolgoruki. Moscow<br>
mayor Yuri Luzkhov has agreed to sponsor the project and both the workers<br>
building the new vessel and the sailors who will serve aboard are counting<br>
on money from Moscow when official government sources dry up. (Izvestia,<br>
October 25) <br>
<p>
Luzkhov and his city have been staunch supporters of the Navy. In January<br>
Luzhkov turned over to the Russian Black Sea Fleet a block of apartments, a<br>
kindergarten and a diagnostic center in Sevastopol -- all funded by Moscow.<br>
The same day, there was a foundation-laying ceremony for a new 300-apartment<br>
block for the fleet's servicemen, also to be paid for by Moscow. The<br>
aircraft-carrying cruiser Moskva once served in the Black Sea Fleet and<br>
after it was written off the name was transferred to a Slava-class cruiser<br>
currently under construction. Moscow is footing the bill for its completion.<br>
(Interfax, January 17 1996)<br>
<p>
Luzkhov has not been hesitant about throwing himself into the debate over<br>
the division of the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet, and has been especially<br>
vocal in promoting the position that Sevastopol -- which Russia wants to<br>
keep as the main base for its Black Sea Fleet -- is and has always been a<br>
Russian city. (ORT, October 21) In view of this enthusiastic support, ships<br>
with names connected to Moscow are probably going to be the norm as the Navy<br>
slowly modernizes. <br>
<p>
RUSSIA LOOKS TO INCREASE ITS INFLUENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. Russian foreign<br>
minister Yevgeny Primakov arrived yesterday in Damascus to begin a<br>
five-nation tour of Middle East capitals that has been billed by Moscow as<br>
part of an effort to reassert itself as a player in the region. But if<br>
Washington's dominant role in the peace process had originally been seen by<br>
Moscow as the primary obstacle to achieving that goal, there are indications<br>
that the Kremlin now fears being pushed to the sidelines by Europe as well.<br>
Western diplomatic sources in Damascus were quoted yesterday as saying that,<br>
in the wake of last week's visit to the region by French president Jacques<br>
Chirac, "Russia fears that the Europeans will be able to gain the approval<br>
of parties in the Middle East for playing a role in the [peace] process at a<br>
time when the Russian role has lost its dynamics." That Russia has become<br>
suspicious over Chirac's call for greater European influence in the Middle<br>
East was evidenced on October 26 when Russia's ambassador to Syria said that<br>
Moscow would refuse to consider any European role in the region as an<br>
alternative to Russia's. "The Madrid conference that launched the peace<br>
process in the Middle East set up a formula under which Russia and the<br>
United States are co-sponsors of the process, and any change in that<br>
mechanism will not serve peace," he said. (UPI, October 26)<br>
<p>
In Washington, meanwhile, Israel's ambassador to the U.S. did not discount<br>
Russia's influence in the region. He charged yesterday that support from<br>
Paris and Moscow for Palestinian president Yasser Arafat had complicated<br>
efforts to finalize a deal between the Israelis and Palestinians on a<br>
partial Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank town of Hebron. According to<br>
Eliahu Ben Elissar, statements by Chirac and Primakov had left Palestinian<br>
president Yasser Arafat obdurate and had made more difficult the task of<br>
U.S. mediator Dennis Ross. Among other things, Chirac called last week for<br>
the establishment of a Palestinian state. Primakov has on a number of<br>
occasions accused Israel of stalling the peace process. (Reuter, October 28)<br>
<p>
CIS AFFAIRS<br>
<p>
BLACK SEA ECONOMIC COOPERATION GROUP SUMMITS IN MOSCOW. Representatives of<br>
the eleven member countries of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC)<br>
group met in Moscow on October 25. Founded in 1992, the group includes<br>
Azerbaijan, Albania, Armenia, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Moldova, Romania,<br>
Russia, Ukraine and Turkey. Representatives of Austria, Egypt, Israel,<br>
Italy, Poland, Slovakia and Tunisia were also present as observers. The<br>
Summit's final declaration called for the transformation of the grouping<br>
into a more structured organization and for promotion of joint economic<br>
projects. The group also confirmed an agreement reached last July on the<br>
formation of a regional development bank with capital of $1.5 billion. It is<br>
to begin its work next year. (UPI, October 25)<br>
<p>
Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, standing in for Boris Yeltsin,<br>
emphasized the importance that Moscow attaches to trade with the BSEC<br>
countries and the desirability of establishing a free trade zone in the<br>
region. Foreign Minister Evgeny Primakov attributed to the BSEC a role in<br>
the building of a new security system in Europe and called for cooperation<br>
between the BSEC and the OSCE, as well as for the establishment of relations<br>
between the BSEC and other international organizations. (Itar-Tass, October<br>
25) Moscow's aspiration to strengthen the profile of the BSEC appears to be<br>
part of an effort to create regional structures with more of an Eastern<br>
orientation in which Russia can attain relative predominance.<br>
<p>
Such intentions aside, however, the enduring importance of bilateral ties<br>
and the continued existence of conflicts of interest were manifested in the<br>
contacts and declarations that accompanied the summit. Chernomyrdin, for<br>
example, met separately with representatives of Ukraine, Turkey, Greece,<br>
Bulgaria, and Romania to discuss a number of bilateral issues. (Interfax,<br>
October 25) Meanwhile, Turkey -- the country that will occupy the group's<br>
rotational presidency after Russia -- has emerged as a serious rival to<br>
Moscow in the race to exert influence in the region. Turkish president<br>
Suleiman Demirel declared that no changes are envisaged in the restricted<br>
use of the Turkish Straits as a transit way for Russian oil exports, a<br>
position to which Moscow has long objected. But Russia joined with Bulgaria<br>
and Greece at the summit in supporting the completion of an oil pipeline<br>
from Burgas, in Bulgaria, to Alexandroupolis, in Greece. It would allow oil<br>
exports from the Russian port of Novorossiisk to reach the Mediterranean,<br>
bypassing the straits (Itar-Tass, October 25)<br>
<p>
THE BALTIC STATES<br>
<p>
LITHUANIAN CONSERVATIVES WIN BIG, WILL ACCELERATE MARKET REFORMS. Final<br>
returns of the first round of Lithuania's parliamentary elections indicate<br>
that Fatherland Union/Lithuanian Conservatives are headed for an absolute<br>
majority in parliament, either singly or jointly with their ally, the<br>
Christian Democratic party. Fatherland Union won 33 seats and the Christian<br>
Democrats 11 seats, out of the 70 which were adjudicated in the first round<br>
of the election on the basis of party slates. The second round, due on<br>
November 10, involves runoffs in 65 single-mandate constituencies. In most<br>
of those runoffs FU and CD candidates are leading and/or competing only with<br>
each other.<br>
<p>
Five parties overcame the 5 percent threshold of parliamentary<br>
representation. The left-of-center Democratic Labor party, which has<br>
governed since 1992, placed fourth, winning only 9 seats, despite a<br>
pre-election endorsement from its founder, President Algirdas Brazauskas.<br>
(ELTA, BNS, October 27 and 28) <br>
<p>
The president had, however, distanced himself from party leaders involved in<br>
corruption affairs that had tarnished and splintered the party. While the<br>
DLP is scrambling to organize a parliamentary and extraparliamentary<br>
left-of-center bloc, the stage seems set for political cohabitation between<br>
Brazauskas and the FU-CD bloc. FU leaders Vytautas Landsbergis and Gediminas<br>
Vagnorius, and CD leader Algirdas Saudargas, have virtually reclaimed their<br>
former posts of chairman of parliament, prime minister, and foreign<br>
minister, respectively. <br>
<p>
The prospective government leaders look set to carry out the terms of their<br>
pre-election pact with the Confederation of Lithuanian Industrialists,<br>
envisaging inter alia income tax cuts, tax exemptions for reinvesting<br>
profits, economic deregulation, and priority to industrial investment in the<br>
allocation of long-term foreign credits. (BNS, October 22)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
NEW UKRAINIAN NAVAL COMMAND APPOINTED. President Leonid Kuchma yesterday<br>
appointed Rear Admiral Mikhaylo Yezhel as commander in chief of Ukraine's<br>
naval forces. Yezhel, whose name had been put forward by Defense Minister<br>
Aleksandr Kuzmuk, was concurrently appointed deputy defense minister. Rear<br>
Admiral Viktor Fomin was appointed first deputy naval commander. The<br>
outgoing commander in chief, Vice-Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovainy, was placed<br>
at the disposal of the defense minister, who yesterday assigned Bezkorovainy<br>
to handle problems related to the partition of the Black Sea Fleet.<br>
(Interfax-Ukraine, October 28) Yezhel, born in 1952, served in the ex-USSR's<br>
Pacific fleet before joining the Ukrainian navy, most recently as<br>
Admiral-Inspector of the Defense Ministry's Main Inspectorate. His<br>
appointment as commander in chief probably presages a promotion to higher<br>
military rank.<br>
<p>
The ministry's Main Inspectorate, together with the Ukrainian President's<br>
General Military Inspectorate, found the performance of Bezkorovainy and of<br>
his two top deputies unsatisfactory and asked them to resign last week. (See<br>
Monitor, October 25). According to the head of the presidential General<br>
Inspectorate, Gen. Valery Hubenko, Bezkorovainy's failings included allowing<br>
the Russian-controlled fleet to conduct exercises in Ukrainian waters<br>
"whenever and wherever it pleased." One of the Inspectorate's conclusions<br>
was that "the rules governing the movement of civilian and military vessels<br>
in our waters are still in the hands of the Russian fleet." Inspectors also<br>
criticized the command's performance in ensuring the ships' battle<br>
worthiness. (UNIAN, October 28) Nevertheless, the timing of the resignation<br>
of Bezkorovainy and his two deputies, on the eve of a reported breakthrough<br>
in Russian-Ukrainian negotiations on the fleet, has fueled speculation that<br>
the three admirals disagreed with concessions made in the fleet negotiations.<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
RUSSIA REFINES POSITION ON CASPIAN SEA STATUS. Ambassador Feliks Kovalev,<br>
head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's working group on Caspian issues,<br>
announced yesterday that Russia has decided to accept the delimitation of<br>
national sectors and economic zones in that sea up to 40 miles from the<br>
shore. Beyond that limit, Moscow continues to insist on creating a zone of<br>
common jurisdiction of the five riparian countries, Kovalev said. He<br>
unsuccessfully presented that proposal at talks on the Caspian Sea's status<br>
recently held by the five in Tehran. Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Duma's<br>
Foreign Affairs Commission and a delegate to the talks, stated that Iran<br>
shared Russia's position in seeking to "limit foreign intervention" in the<br>
Caspian Sea. <br>
<p>
Azerbaijani foreign minister Hassan Hassanov acknowledged the evolution in<br>
Russia's position, which had until now rejected any sectoral division. But<br>
Hassanov commented publicly that any "common jurisdiction" zone would<br>
seriously complicate the development of oil and gas resources. He predicted<br>
that Moscow would eventually accept that there is no substitute for sectoral<br>
delimitation as set out in international law. (Interfax, Turan, October 28;<br>
IRNA, October 27)<br>
<p>
Kazakhstan, in a demonstration of support for Baku's position, has recently<br>
concluded with Azerbaijan a bilateral agreement on regulating military<br>
navigation in the Caspian Sea. The agreement makes no reference to Russia or<br>
Iran, which profess the view that such agreements require common consent<br>
among the littoral states.<br>

RYBKIN CALLS FOR AMNESTY FOR CHECHEN REBELS. During a meeting on October 24,<br>
President Yeltsin's new security chief and envoy to Chechnya, Ivan Rybkin,<br>
and Ingush president Ruslan Aushev issued a joint call for an immediate<br>
amnesty for those who fought on the side of the Chechen opposition.<br>
(Itar-Tass, October 24) Earlier, there had been reports that a draft<br>
resolution on granting such an amnesty was being prepared by the government<br>
in response to an initiative by Rybkin. (Ekho Moskvy, October 22)<br>
<p>
YELTSIN STRIPS KORZHAKOV OF MILITARY DUTIES. President Boris Yeltsin signed<br>
an order yesterday relieving his former chief bodyguard and drinking buddy,<br>
Lt. Gen. Aleksandr Korzhakov, of all his military duties. (AP, October 27)<br>
Yeltsin sacked Korzhakov in June; since then, Korzhakov has fueled Yeltsin's<br>
anger by forming an alliance with ousted security chief Aleksandr Lebed.<br>
<p>
SECRET POLICE TO JOIN FIGHT AGAINST TAX DODGERS. It has been revealed that<br>
when Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Presidential Chief-of-Staff<br>
Anatoly Chubais made their unusual visit to the headquarters of the Federal<br>
Security Service last week, they enlisted the help of the security police in<br>
tracking down businesses that owe substantial tax arrears. (Segodnya,<br>
October 26)<br>
<p>
DUMA WARNS AGAINST NATO ENLARGEMENT. Russia's Duma on October 25 issued an<br>
appeal to the U.N., the OSCE, the Council of Europe's Parliamentary<br>
Assembly, and the North Atlantic Assembly, as well as to the parliaments of<br>
the CIS, Eastern European, and NATO countries that expressed profound<br>
concern over NATO's planned enlargement. The appeal warned that enlargement<br>
might provoke a renewal of East-West confrontation and could cost Eastern<br>
European governments billions of dollars. (Itar-Tass, October 25)<br>
<p>
PRIMAKOV TO MIDDLE EAST. Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov arrives<br>
in Syria today to begin a trip that will also take him to Lebanon, Egypt,<br>
Israel, Jordan, and the self-ruled Palestinian territories. Moscow has<br>
described the tour as part of an effort to reactivate Russia's role in the<br>
region. A Russian diplomat on October 26 warned Europe against trying to<br>
supplant Russia as a player in Middle East peace negotiations. Earlier,<br>
Moscow had welcomed French president Jacques Chirac's recent Middle East<br>
trip. (UPI, October 26)<br>
<p>
PEACEKEEPERS TO BE VOLUNTEERS. A government directive issued on Saturday<br>
specifies that all Russian soldiers on international peacekeeping missions<br>
must be volunteers and must sign a contract for the tour. The Defense<br>
Ministry must pay the costs of the peacekeeping forces out of its regular<br>
budget. (Interfax, October 26)<br>
<p>
GOVERNMENT PLEDGES MONEY FOR AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY, BUT=85 The Russian=<br>
 government<br>
presidium last week said it would set aside 9.3 trillion rubles for the<br>
troubled aircraft industry, but a Duma deputy cautioned that the money would<br>
have to be "squeezed out" of the new 1997 budget. Nikolai Gonchar said that<br>
-- if the finance and economics ministers agree -- 1.3 trillion rubles would<br>
go to research, 4 trillion to pay for leasing aircraft, and 4 trillion to<br>
renew the working capital of the plane builders. (Interfax, October 25)<br>
<p>
MOSCOW DISAPPROVES OF KARABAKH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. In an October 26<br>
statement, Russia's Foreign Ministry described Karabakh's decision to hold a<br>
presidential election next month as a contravention of an OSCE decision<br>
stipulating that the election can only be held after the determination of<br>
Karabakh's political status. The statement also criticized the exclusion of<br>
Azeri refugees from the voting, and said that the election would complicate<br>
already difficult negotiations while fueling military tensions, and in<br>
effect, "challenging the international community." (Itar-Tass, October 26)<br>

RYBKIN HOLDS FIRST MEETING WITH CHECHEN OPPOSITION. Back in Moscow after a<br>
weekend visit to the north Caucasus, President Yeltsin's new security chief<br>
and envoy to Chechnya, Ivan Rybkin, said his talks with Chechen leaders were<br>
"very productive" and that both sides wanted peace. (BBC, October 28) This<br>
was Rybkin's first meeting with Chechen opposition leaders. He and the newly<br>
appointed prime minister of the Chechen opposition, Aslan Maskhadov, met<br>
yesterday in Ingushetia, bordering on Chechnya. Rybkin assured the Chechen<br>
leaders that he would honor the Khasavyurt accords signed on August 31 by<br>
Maskhadov and Rybkin's predecessor, Aleksandr Lebed. (Interfax, October 27)<br>
The Chechens, however, accused the federal government of violating these<br>
accords by keeping federal troops on Chechen territory. Moscow is insisting<br>
that the 205th brigade of Defense Ministry troops and the 101st brigade of<br>
Interior Ministry troops should remain in Chechnya on a permanent basis.<br>
Chechen foreign minister Ruslan Chimaev objected that no provision was made<br>
for their presence in any of the documents signed by the two sides. Chimaev<br>
also expressed concern over remarks made by Rybkin that referred to<br>
"incorrect steps" taken by his predecessor, Lebed. (Nezavisimaya gazeta,<br>
October 26)<br>
<p>
Also yesterday, a congress of the Chechen people was held in Urus-Martan.<br>
This was the largest political gathering in Chechnya since Russia sent<br>
troops to the republic at the end of 1994. The congress was attended by 1500<br>
delegates, representing all sections of the population and local<br>
administration as well as the Chechen diaspora. The delegates approved the<br>
decision to hold presidential and parliamentary elections on January 27. The<br>
elections are to be organized by an election commission appointed in 1992,<br>
while Djohar Dudaev was president. Current Chechen president Zelimkhan<br>
Yandarbiev had wanted the elections held earlier. (NTV, October 27) On<br>
October 25, the Russian Duma (with the sole exception of the "Yabloko"<br>
faction) adopted a resolution condemning the Chechen opposition for<br>
unilaterally forming a coalition government. (Interfax, October 25)<br>
<p>
To some degree, all of these problems existed earlier. But Lebed, who<br>
enjoyed great authority among the Chechen leaders, was often able to<br>
persuade the Chechen side to avoid sharp statements on the grounds that such<br>
remarks might give Moscow's "party of war" a pretext for breaking off the<br>
peace process. Rybkin does not enjoy the same authority.<br>
<p>
DEFENSE MINISTER WARNS OF CRISIS IN ARMY. Russian defense minister Igor<br>
Rodionov warned on October 25 that chronic under-financing has created a<br>
crisis situation in the armed forces and intimated that it could lead to a<br>
loss of political control over Russia's soldiers. On a day when President<br>
Boris Yeltsin called for an end to Kremlin in-fighting, Rodionov said to a<br>
meeting of Russian veterans that the funding arrears are "taking the armed<br>
forces to the brink of undesirable, and even uncontrollable developments."<br>
The Russian Army General also said that social conditions for Russian<br>
military personnel have become especially intolerable, and he cautioned that<br>
a failure to increase defense spending in the 1997 state budget could lead<br>
to a breakdown of the armed forces "as an integral and active state<br>
structure." Rodionov claimed that the level of defense spending contained in<br>
the current draft budget would cover only one-third of the army's essential<br>
needs. He also restated his now familiar argument that budgetary funds need<br>
to be freed up by subjecting Russia's other "power structures" to the same<br>
sort of restructuring and down-sizing planned for the regular army.<br>
(Interfax, Itar-Tass, Reuter, AP, October 25)<br>
<p>
Prior to being sacked on October 18, former Russian security chief Aleksandr<br>
Lebed had issued dire warnings of an imminent "mutiny" by disgruntled<br>
military personnel, but Rodionov had downplayed the danger at that time.<br>
(See Monitor, September 26, October 2) His remarks on October 25, however,<br>
came as the Duma moved to discuss the revised 1997 budget, and Rodionov may<br>
be hoping that his alarmist remarks will influence that debate in favor of<br>
the army. The draft budget allocates approximately $18 billion for military<br>
spending for 1997. In addition to winning an increase in that figure,<br>
Rodionov is also aiming to recover funding earmarked for, but not received<br>
by the army in 1996. More than $1 billion has recently been set aside to<br>
finance military reform.=20<br>

GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION INVALID IN KRASNODAR, COMMUNIST LEADS IN STAVROPOL.<br>
Elections for governor were held in six Russian regions yesterday. Though<br>
final results are not yet in, the voting in the economically and<br>
strategically important Krasnodar krai in southern Russia has already been<br>
declared invalid. This means that hawkish incumbent Nikolai Yegorov, who<br>
until June was President Yeltsin's chief of staff, will remain in office<br>
until a repeat election is organized in three months' time. Krasnodar is<br>
unusual since its election law mandates a turnout of 50 percent for the<br>
election to be valid -- only 43 percent of the electorate went to the polls<br>
yesterday. (Most regions require a more attainable 25 percent.) Last week,<br>
Yegorov caused a stir when he gave an interview saying Yeltsin was too sick<br>
to run the country and should stand down to allow fresh presidential<br>
elections. A gubernatorial election was also held yesterday in Stavropol<br>
krai, which, like Krasnodar, has traditionally been considered part of<br>
Russia's "red belt." There, preliminary results put the Communist candidate<br>
in the lead. (Itar-Tass, October 28) Regional elections began in Russia on<br>
September 1 and will continue until the beginning of next year.<br>
<p>
TATARSTAN AND MOSCOW ON COLLISION COURSE. President Mintimer Shaimiev of<br>
Tatarstan has reacted angrily to threats by the Russian government that<br>
could bankrupt two companies based on the territory of his republic.<br>
Tatarstan enjoys substantial autonomy within the Russian Federation and is<br>
one of only a handful of Russian regions that are net contributors to the<br>
federal budget. Shaimiev warned in a televised interview that, even if the<br>
Russian government goes ahead with its threat, Tatarstan will be "in no<br>
hurry" to carry out Moscow's orders. He described the threat as an unlawful<br>
attempt by Moscow to put "political pressure" on Tatarstan. (NTV, October=<br>
 26)<br>
<p>
Last week, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin announced that he was giving<br>
the giant KamAZ truck plant, which is located in Tatarstan, 24 hours to pay<br>
its tax arrears. If it did not, Chernomyrdin said, the government would<br>
launch proceedings to bankrupt the company, along with three other chronic<br>
tax dodgers. Earlier, the government had threatened to start similar<br>
proceedings against the Tatarstan oil company, Tatneft. (Nezavisimaya<br>
gazeta, October 16; Interfax, October 24) Protests by the government of<br>
Tatarstan resulted in Tatneft's removal from the government's black list.<br>
(Segodnya, October 18) KamAZ protested that its tax arrears were rescheduled<br>
under an April presidential decree, but Chernomyrdin has repeated his threat<br>
to shut the truck plant down if it does not pay its arrears. (Segodnya,<br>
October 26) Shaimiev has pointed out that KamAZ is the largest supplier of<br>
trucks not just to Russia, but also to the CIS and that, if KamAZ was<br>
bankrupted, transport of vital goods would grind to a halt throughout the<br>
CIS. (RTR, October 25)<br>
<p>
NEW STRATEGIC SUBMARINE TO BE BUILT. Foul weather prevented several VIPs<br>
from flying to Severodvinsk over the weekend to take part in the keel-laying<br>
of a new class of strategic missile submarine, so the event has been<br>
postponed for one week. First Deputy Defense Minister Andrei Kokoshin, one<br>
of those who had planned to attend the ceremony, described the new "Yuri<br>
Dolgoruky" as a state-of-the-art nuclear missile carrying submarine with<br>
"substantial improvements" over those in service today. (Nezavisimaya<br>
gazeta, October 25) For his part, Presidential Chief of Staff Anatoly<br>
Chubais called the new submarine "a totally unique thing=85 a submarine for<br>
the next century." He, Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov, and navy commander in<br>
chief Admiral Feliks Gromov had also planned to attend the event. Given the<br>
turmoil in defense enterprises over tardy wages, Chubais said that he had<br>
arranged with the Finance Ministry to ensure that the workers at the plant<br>
building the new vessel would get at least some of their back pay today.<br>
(Interfax, October 26)<br>
<p>
Although the new ship could be a replacement for the cruise-missile carrying<br>
Oscar class, most reports indicated it would be armed with ballistic<br>
missiles. Currently, the backbone of the naval leg of Russia's strategic<br>
nuclear deterrent is comprised of 6 Typhoon and 7 Delta IV ballistic-missile<br>
submarines, the oldest of which was put into service in 1983. These will be<br>
reaching the end of their 20-year service life about the time the first Yuri<br>
Dolgoruky is commissioned. Production of the new sub is likely to spark<br>
renewed criticism in the West that Russia is wasting scarce resources on<br>
defense production, despite Moscow's serious economic problems and the end<br>
of the Cold War.<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
IS MOLDOVA'S PRESIDENT LEARNING FROM LUKASHENKO? In separate, virtually<br>
identical interviews with a Moldovan weekly and a Russian news agency,<br>
Moldovan president Mircea Snegur warned that he would seek to dismiss the<br>
government ("the biggest evil") and to dissolve the parliament ("from which<br>
nothing can be expected any longer") if he is reelected president next<br>
month. Acknowledging that the constitution does not give him those powers,<br>
Snegur said he would "turn to the people and insist on calling a referendum<br>
on the issue of confidence in the parliament." The president blamed the<br>
social costs of reforms on those two institutions and vowed to seek expanded<br>
powers in order to "establish order, pay ordinary people's pensions on<br>
time... and index to the inflation rate the population's deposits in the<br>
state bank." (Flux weekly, October 22-28; Interfax, October 24)<br>
<p>
The leader of the governing Agrarian Democratic party, Dumitru Motpan, for<br>
his part, told the media that the parliament and government would continue<br>
reforms if either Prime minister Andrei Sangheli or Parliament Chairman<br>
Petru Lucinschi wins the presidential election. Should Snegur win, the<br>
parliament and government will continue exercising their powers under the<br>
constitution, Motpan said. (Basapress and Flux news agencies, October 24)<br>
<p>
Snegur has become the second president of a newly independent country in<br>
Europe who seeks to change the constitution and establish a presidential<br>
regime through a controlled plebiscite. Belarus president Aleksandr<br>
Lukashenko was the first. Unlike Lukashenko, however, who has pursued a<br>
policy of "integration" with Russia, Snegur has made an alliance with a<br>
nationalist pro-Romanian movement. Snegur's statements also reflect his<br>
populist strategy of seeking reelection at the cost of undermining reforms.=<br>

<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
MASS RALLY SUPPORTS ARMENIAN OPPOSITION'S APPEAL TO CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. An<br>
estimated 50,000 to 100,000 supporters of Armenia's opposition rallied in<br>
central Yerevan on October 25, and opposition leaders called a follow-up<br>
rally for November 1. The rallies are meant to support the five-party<br>
opposition coalition's petition to the Constitutional Court to annul the<br>
September 22 presidential election and order a repeat of the balloting. The<br>
opposition's joint candidate, Vazgen Manukian, submitted the petition to the<br>
Court on October 24 along with nearly 500 pages of documents intended as<br>
evidence of vote-rigging and other violations of the law. Under the law, the<br>
Court must begin hearings within 12 days after the petition's submission,<br>
and render a verdict within a month. The five parties announced a boycott of<br>
next month's local elections on the grounds that current conditions in<br>
Armenia make it impossible to hold a fair and democratic balloting. Other<br>
opposition groups have announced similar decisions. (Noyan-Tapan, Interfax,<br>
Western agencies, October 25 through 27)<br>
<p>
The appeal is intended to demonstrate that the opposition adheres to due<br>
process of law, and also responds to recommendations of the OSCE and other<br>
Western forums. However, the Court is believed to be politically loyal to<br>
President Levon Ter-Petrosian and is therefore expected to validate the<br>
election irrespective of the evidence of fraud. In a press interview<br>
published over the weekend, the president insisted on describing the<br>
opposition -- or major components of it -- as "fascist." (Respublika<br>
Armenia, October 26)<br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
TAJIK OPPOSITION SHOWS STRENGTH IN KARATEGIN. In retaliation for the<br>
introduction of presidential guard checkpoints in the area, Tajik opposition<br>
fighters on October 24 captured 37 Interior Ministry troops near the<br>
district center Komsomolabad. The opposition demands an immediate withdrawal<br>
of those checkpoints as the main condition for releasing the prisoners. UN<br>
military observers are attempting to resolve the incident, which threatens<br>
the ceasefire in the strategic Karategin valley. (Interfax, Itar-Tass,<br>
October 24 through 27)<br>
<p>
The opposition has controlled most of the strategically located valley since<br>
last August. On September 17 the Tajik government and opposition signed a<br>
ceasefire agreement codifying the opposition's gains in the Karategin valley<br>
and banning troop deployments there. Last week, however, the government<br>
began introducing presidential guard units, prompting opposition commander<br>
Mullo Abdullo to retaliate. The interior troops' easy surrender illustrates<br>
the poor morale of most government forces.=20<br>

"MASTER AND MAN" IN TODAY'S RUSSIA<br>
By Albert Speransky<br>
<p>
PART 1: THE "RED DIRECTORS"<br>
(This is the first of three articles)<br>
<p>
	A Soviet-style enterprise director is one of the most enigmatic figures of<br>
our time. This kind of director was appointed to his post at the<br>
"recommendation" of oblast or district Communist party committees. The party<br>
committees no longer exist but the directors remain, like "fixed-post"<br>
agents of the old regime, sentries left behind, unrelieved and forgotten, by<br>
a hurriedly retreating army.<br>
	Shortly after the Communist party committees ceased to exist, the final<br>
hour came for the Soviet ministries which once controlled every move of an<br>
enterprise director. It was at this moment that the reforms began; the<br>
reforms stumbled over the directors, ricocheted, and went along a curved<br>
path or even hit the skids.<br>
	But the fact is that we all have become hostages to these directors. It is<br>
precisely the directors who have dragged our economy into a deadlock, not<br>
any particular one of them, but all of them combined and, as long as we do<br>
not understand  the mentality of the "red director," we will not understand<br>
what is happening to our country and our economy.<br>
	Lenin himself once attempted to formulate a set of qualifications a person<br>
should have to be the head of an industrial enterprise. In a letter to<br>
Kamenev, Lenin outlined these specifications: "The paramount task of the<br>
Communist party is to lead the masses, who are exhausted and looking for a<br>
way out, to show them the right way, to make them respect labor discipline.<br>
Labor conditions can be discussed at rallies. At work, employees must be<br>
implicitly obedient to a Soviet manager, their 'dictator' during working hours."<br>
	If someone is called a "dictator," this naturally means that his will and<br>
his ambitions are above the law. This is true not only within the territory<br>
surrounded by the factory fence; the "area of serfdom" was also supposed to<br>
include the workers' settlement, including kindergartens, schools and shops.<br>
A closed-off little world, ruled by a single master.<br>
	But, this "master" was, in fact, a serf himself, bound by the will of his<br>
own feudal lord, his boss. <br>
<p>
A Change in Work Habits<br>
	In the Soviet era, enterprise directors were like company-level political<br>
officers in the army, whose job was to make the soldiers get up and attack<br>
the enemy one more time, or in this case, to inspire the collective to<br>
fulfill the production plan. This work, however hard, became habitual for<br>
the directors. Not so much time has passed since then, but the<br>
command-administrative system has gone. And now it is hard to find a<br>
director at his enterprise. And that's during working hours, not to mention<br>
nights and weekends. When asked where he is, secretaries and aides reply<br>
vaguely: "He's gone off somewhere. He'll be back later." You can wait<br>
outside his office for hours without any hope of getting an appointment to<br>
see him.<br>
	I had an opportunity to "study" the activities of a number of enterprise<br>
directors recently. The study led me to conclude that the directors do not<br>
want to have anything improved or modernized at their enterprises. Moreover,<br>
they do not want to work at all.<br>
	Consider, for example, the large "Mayak" radio factory in Kursk. It is well<br>
known that state defense orders have diminished. Seeking to save the<br>
enterprise and its technical and human potential, the factory's engineers<br>
and designers began to bombard the director with conversion projects. These<br>
projects required no major reconstruction or remodeling of the factory:<br>
Everything could have been organized with the existing production lines. But<br>
the director rejected all these proposals out of hand, not even taking the<br>
trouble to read them. The result was that the enterprise shut down and went<br>
bankrupt.<br>
	Thousands of examples of this sort can be cited. A similar case occurred,<br>
for example, at the Perm electrical appliance factory. The director of the<br>
Moscow "Caliber" plant went even further: Instead of beginning conversion to<br>
new  production items, he fired nearly all of the enterprise's designers,<br>
which meant burying the enterprise alive.<br>
<p>
Criminal Decline<br>
	Contrary to the widespread opinion, it was not January 1, 1992 (when<br>
Gaidar's reforms were started) that a precipitous criminal decline began in<br>
the directors' ranks. It was much earlier, when the "weeping Bolshevik,"<br>
Nikolai Ryzhkov, was prime minister. The people were demanding reforms, and<br>
Ryzhkov feared them like fire. He gave a green light to cooperatives and<br>
allowed private property. However, what Ryzhkov had given permission to were<br>
not cooperatives in the broad sense, but only cooperatives at state-run<br>
enterprises. Not just anyone, but the directors, their wives, children and<br>
other relatives became the founders of these cooperatives, which became<br>
parasites on the body of the national economy. Producing nothing, living off<br>
some bogus intermediary activities, they began to divert huge sums of money<br>
to secret bank accounts.<br>
	How was it possible to allow the directors to establish "family companies"<br>
at state-run enterprises? Willingly or unwillingly, Mr. Ryzhkov became the<br>
godfather of a new movement which led to the criminalization of the economy.<br>
	These directors, with the help of their "family firms," got passing marks<br>
in the "school of criminal business." Tall factory chimneys and spacious<br>
shops served well to cover up directors' private companies which produced<br>
nothing but generated unheard of amounts of cash, to be divided up in the<br>
directors' offices. <br>
<p>
Nonpayment<br>
	As soon as a free market for goods, including consumer goods, machinery and<br>
equipment, appeared in this country (i.e. the system of administrative<br>
distribution died out) the directors faced the problem of how to sell their<br>
obsolete production. They resolved the problem by supplying the results of<br>
their workers' labor to each other by the trainload, without any guarantees,<br>
on the basis of mutual "gentlemen's agreements." Our directors have never<br>
been altruists, much less fools, especially when it came to their own<br>
personal interest. One does not have to be very wise to presume that the<br>
"agreement" provided for certain amounts of money (in cash) changing hands<br>
at secret places. However, the directors also mastered barter operations<br>
which are absolutely impossible to monitor.<br>
	It appears that in starting this risky game, the directors did not actually<br>
take any risk. They hoped for the support of their "blood brothers" in the<br>
structures of government. Faced with an outcry over employees not being paid<br>
their wages -- the government organized a mutual cancellation of debts. What<br>
choice did they have? The directors were encouraged to try again. They<br>
expected the government to behave the same way. However, they are still<br>
waiting. But they can afford to wait.<br>
	New directors were elected recently at three Moscow enterprises (the 1st<br>
Clock factory, the "Caliber" plant and the Wallpaper Factory) to replace<br>
directors who were distinguished for their rapacity. What was the result? At<br>
first, the newly elected directors did not know what to do. A bit later they<br>
began successfully to continue the course of their predecessors. Given<br>
Russia's byzantine legislation, it is a sin not to take advantage of the<br>
shareholders' property. Production continues to fall. Loans taken by the<br>
government, including those in foreign currency, are immediately channeled<br>
abroad. A host of questionable agreements (which lose money for the<br>
enterprises) are signed, mainly with foreign companies, which the<br>
enterprises must fulfill or pay penalties. For example, the Kondopoga Paper<br>
Combine charged $400 a ton for paper to domestic consumers and only $196 per<br>
ton to foreign customers. As a result the combine incurred a loss of $22.5<br>
million. One does not have to be very wise to see that the discount was not<br>
granted to foreign customers for their beautiful eyes. Look for secret bank<br>
accounts. Whose property has been squandered?<br>
<p>
Whom are They Afraid of?<br>
	Our directors are not afraid of the government because they have long had<br>
common interests with state apparatchiks and have come to terms with them.<br>
Furthermore, our directors are not afraid of courts and prosecutors because,<br>
in the Soviet tradition, our judicial bodies almost always take the side of<br>
administration.<br>
	Nevertheless, there are things which are very unpleasant for the directors.<br>
They are afraid of audits. The fear is baseless. The fact is that auditor<br>
services are very expensive. The government has no intention of running up<br>
such expenses while employees don't even have enough money for a crust of bread.<br>
	Directors are also afraid of racketeers. In fact, criminal groups<br>
specializing in extortion have a good "nose" for unearned money. They come<br>
and demand their cut.<br>
	But what the directors fear most of all are the new free trade unions which<br>
have recently begun to appear. So far, these trade unions are the only force<br>
in the country seeking to save enterprises from collapsing, to save jobs and<br>
to try to organize resistance to the directors' swindles.<br>
<p>
Do the Directors Have Any Chance in the Conditions of a Free Market? <br>
	The style of power in Russian enterprises is becoming increasingly<br>
reminiscent of the mafia. The members of the director's team are tied<br>
together by their common involvement in certain unsavory acts. An attempt to<br>
disband a superfluous department or fire a deputy director might well<br>
promote a mafia-style clash which often results in a contract murder.<br>
	A bankruptcy procedure or attempt at restructuring should not be limited to<br>
just replacing the director. It is necessary to "uproot" the entire<br>
administration to cut the criminal connections existing within the staff. If<br>
you remove the director, while leaving his team in place there will be no<br>
change at all, and the psychological climate at the enterprise will not improve.<br>
	In all likelihood, the current directors are "transitional" figures. At<br>
this point their aim is to grab the enterprise's property, fire the workers,<br>
and shut down production. After this is done, they will begin to sell the<br>
enterprise, shop by shop, building by building, etc., because they will<br>
hardly find a customer ready to buy it all at once. When enterprises are<br>
managed by such "provisional governors" it is simply naive to expect any<br>
increase in production.<br>
	The former Central Institute of Standard Design is a graphic example of<br>
what is happening to our state property, on which the fate of the workers<br>
directly depends. First the director forged documents, got his institute<br>
privatized and made it part of a mythical firm, established by a commercial<br>
bank.<br>
	When the employees of the Institute found out about it, they voted "no<br>
confidence" in the director, and protested his actions. However, the<br>
director was able to undermine the "rebels'" unity. He "bought off" some of<br>
them with good salaries, promising them "hills of gold." He fired the<br>
organizers of the protest. The "traitors" earned the extra rubles in their<br>
pay packets. The administration set them against those who had been fired<br>
and forced them to give false evidence in court in favor of the director.<br>
Finally, the director was able to win. The "fighters for justice" met their<br>
fate. Then it was the strikebreakers' turn. No longer needing the<br>
"defenders," the director fired them as well.<br>
	This story ought to be a lesson for all our labor collectives, because this<br>
scheme may well be used by other directors. In fact, some have already<br>
launched similar campaigns.<br>
	The expected bankruptcies, and the numerous changes in leadership of large<br>
enterprises made the directors feel uneasy. Feeling the uncertainty of their<br>
situation, they decided to secure themselves financially. They actively<br>
started to buy up shares from their employees. And the employees willingly<br>
parted with them for a pittance, being persuaded that these pieces of paper<br>
were of no use to them anyway, since they entitled them to no dividends or<br>
extra votes at shareholders' meetings.<br>
	Simultaneously, the directors began to fight against those holding large<br>
share parcels. They waged this war in their habitual brash and insolent<br>
style, stopping at nothing.<br>
	Thus, at a shareholders' meeting of the Mid-Volga Machine Tool<br>
Manufacturing Plant, a group of investors who held 28 percent of the<br>
enterprise's stock was not even invited to the dais. At the same time, in<br>
his speech at the meeting, the director harshly criticized the investors,<br>
accusing them of staging provocations. He claimed that they obstructed the<br>
adoption of the plant's charter (incidentally, the charter contradicted<br>
Russian law). The directors of the Lebedinsk Ore Refining Combine (Belgorod<br>
oblast), the "Bolshevichka" Moscow Garment Factory and Norilsk Nickel Mining<br>
and Metallurgical Conglomerate have all acted in the same manner. In<br>
violation of the law, the directors prevented co-owners of their enterprises<br>
from participating in management.<br>
	Let's see how events developed at the "Novgorodsky" privatized construction<br>
company in the Nizhny Novgorod oblast. After the enterprise was privatized,<br>
the director, Boris Arest, began to look for investors and found a Turkish<br>
firm. Finally, an agreement was signed according to which the Turkish firm<br>
acquired 78 percent of the enterprise thus becoming its factual owner.<br>
Shortly afterwards the new owners found it necessary to fire the director<br>
for surreptitiously selling modern equipment supplied to the company. The<br>
resolution dismissing the director was approved at a shareholders meeting.<br>
The owners wanted to take the keys and seals away from him right in the<br>
meeting hall. But the director had a squad of bodyguards under his command<br>
and insisted that he would not allow anyone else to take control of the<br>
enterprise, much less the Turks. And representatives of local law<br>
enforcement quietly watched all this lawlessness, as if it were not their<br>
job to make sure that the country's laws were enforced. Is it possible to<br>
expect foreign investors to come to our country when such arbitrariness<br>
reigns everywhere?<br>
	And here is another example. For nearly a year a woman from the Astrakhan<br>
region tried to assert her rights as a shareholder. Having developed too<br>
much faith in privatization she sold her flat and invested the money in<br>
shares of the Zelengin Shipyard, acquiring, at least on paper, 15 percent of<br>
the enterprise. These shares, it would seem, should have given her the<br>
possibility to have at least some influence on the shipyard's economic<br>
policy. In another country, perhaps. In ours, it doesn't work that way. The<br>
shipyard was rapidly going to pieces. The woman demanded that an emergency<br>
shareholders meeting be called. The demand was honored, a meeting took place<br>
and it returned a no confidence vote in the director. However, on the next<br>
day the director declared that the meeting was held illegally and hence its<br>
resolution was invalid. For nearly a year the poor woman sought to assert<br>
her rights. She even managed to reach the office of Anatoly Chubais. All in<br>
vain.<br>
	The list of examples can be continued. The administration of the<br>
Krasnoyarsk Aluminum Plant simply crossed "outsiders," or anyone else they<br>
didn't like, off the shareholders register. At Moscow's famous automotive<br>
giant, ZIL, the director did not come to terms with the investors from<br>
Microdin company. The director wrote a letter to President Yeltsin asking<br>
that he use his power to pick more suitable, "more patriotic," investors.<br>
	Who acquired the right to manage property in this country after the first<br>
stage of privatization? The same directors! Are there any guarantees<br>
provided for an owner or for the right to own property? No answer can be<br>
given to this question.<br>
<p>
Directors and Politics<br>
	At present our directors can well be called suicidal. By their actions, and<br>
their greed, they are virtually aiding the Communists in their efforts to<br>
regain power. And a "red" government can only hold onto power by repressing<br>
these very directors, expropriating the property they have stolen, which<br>
often goes far beyond simply their packet of shares in their enterprise. The<br>
first thing the workers will point their fingers at are the directors'<br>
villas, their limousines, and other objects of luxury. <br>
	The Communists will revive the notorious organs which used to exist in the<br>
USSR: People's control, the OBKhSS (the agency to combat the embezzlement of<br>
socialist property), and they will severely punish those guilty of stealing<br>
socialist property. Communist Duma deputy, Deputy Chairman of the State<br>
Duma's Committee on Legislation Yuri Ivanov says: "It will not be a court of<br>
law, but ad hoc extraordinary commissions that will decide who must be<br>
deprived of property. This process will be initiated mainly by the labor<br>
collectives." Therefore, we obviously must conclude that the directors have<br>
done everything in their power to provoke the lumpen-proletariat to take the<br>
offensive, and for it to become aggressive and merciless. Certainly,<br>
somebody will look for guilty parties outside the factory yards, among the<br>
pro-reform politicians, however, the workers will assert social justice<br>
first of all at home in their factories.<br>
	It's a pity that the directors, being citizens of this country, knowing its<br>
severe customs, do not take the trouble to think of the possible<br>
consequences of their actions...<br>
<p>
When will New People Come to Manage Production?<br>
	Many are surprised that new people do not come to build or reconstruct our<br>
production, our economy, to squeeze out the old directors, and start<br>
producing goods again. Some say that it is because high taxes make<br>
production unprofitable. That is only partially true. What kind of a fool<br>
would build his business, his future, on nothing but air? Land cannot be<br>
bought and sold, but only rented. At any moment, our rulers can cancel a<br>
rental agreement and advise a tenant to leave and take his walls and roof<br>
with him.<br>
	People say that the main stage of privatization still lies ahead -- when<br>
they will privatize the land on which the factory machines rest. But that is<br>
the future. Right now, all the privatized property is "hanging in the air."<br>
As long as it hangs like this, there is no point in waiting for genuine<br>
reforms or positive changes. However we curse the directors, the fact is<br>
that they are acting quite logically trying to grab at least something for<br>
themselves: to remit some money to a banking account, to build a cottage,<br>
buy a car, a house in Paris, i.e. something that they can really call their<br>
own. Unfortunately, this does not enrich our country as well; it ruins it.<br>
<p>
What Should be Done?<br>
	Among the general public the word "reforms" is increasingly becoming a<br>
curse word. Not because the people fail to understand that reforms are<br>
necessary. The fact is that the people have seen for themselves that the<br>
whole idea has been profaned and distorted by the apparatchiks. After saying<br>
"A," the government forgot to say "B." Paradoxical situations emerge where<br>
employees request that their enterprise be subjected to a bankruptcy<br>
procedure, i.e. be sold at an auction. They do it because they understand<br>
that a bankruptcy is the last chance for the enterprise to survive. If the<br>
director is not removed, the enterprise itself will disappear. It will blow<br>
away in the wind.<br>
	But the government as well as the Federal Department for Bankruptcies<br>
remain deaf to such desperate appeals.<br>
	The moment is truly a crucial one. For the sake of our country and her<br>
economy it is necessary to do whatever is necessary to nourish genuine<br>
proprietors, people who are interested, not in closing down enterprises, but<br>
in modernizing and developing them. Unfortunately, no legal basis has been<br>
established to create the conditions for such proprietors to appear. The<br>
Duma is procrastinating, and so are our politicians. We have no laws in<br>
effect to help pull our economy from the present "criminal" market to a<br>
genuine free market.<br>

NEWS:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN DRAFT BUDGET AMENDED. The Russian government met yesterday and<br>
amended the draft 1997 federal budget to take account of parliament's demand<br>
for an increase in planned social spending. The new draft will now go to a<br>
conciliation commission made up of representatives of the government and<br>
parliament. (Itar-Tass, October 24)<br>
<p>
MOSCOW BACKS FRANCE'S MIDDLE EAST OVERTURES. Russia's Foreign Ministry<br>
yesterday applauded French president Jacques Chirac and the efforts of<br>
French diplomats to strengthen Europe's role in the Middle East peace<br>
process. A ministry spokesman said that Moscow and Paris were working<br>
together actively on Middle East issues. (Itar-Tass, October 24) During a<br>
trip to the region Chirac has called for the creation of a Palestinian state<br>
and suggested that the U.S.-led peace process is losing momentum. (AP,<br>
October 24)<br>
<p>
MOSCOW URGES IFOR EXTENSION. The head of the Russian peacekeeping contingent<br>
in Bosnia said in Brussels yesterday that IFOR should remain in Bosnia<br>
beyond the expiration of its current mandate on December 20. According to<br>
Col. Gen. Leonty Shevtsov, a withdrawal from Bosnia would lead to a renewal<br>
of hostilities there because IFOR is the "only guarantee of peace" in the<br>
region. Shevtsov recommended that the current IFOR contingent be halved if<br>
its mandate is renewed. (Interfax, October 24)<br>
<p>
MOSCOW PRESSED TO PARTICIPATE IN NATO PFP. A high-ranking NATO official in<br>
Brussels yesterday expressed disappointment that Moscow has yet to take an<br>
active part in the alliance's Partnership for Peace program, and advised<br>
that only through participation could Moscow hope to influence relations<br>
between NATO and Russia. (Interfax, October 24) That same line of thinking<br>
was embraced by former Russian security council secretary Aleksandr Lebed<br>
during and after his visit to Brussels earlier this month. (See Perspective<br>
item) <br>
<p>
NAVY FIRES MISSILE TO DESTROY IT. The Russian Navy employed an inexpensive<br>
means to get rid of one of its excess SS-N-20 submarine-launched ballistic<br>
missiles (SLBM) on October 23 by firing it from a Northern Fleet Typhoon<br>
strategic submarine in the Arctic. The missile was programmed to<br>
self-destruct when it reached an altitude of more than 3,000 meters. A<br>
Foreign Ministry spokesman said preliminary reports confirmed that the<br>
operation was "ecologically clean." (Itar-Tass, October 24)<br>
<p>
SMOKE-FILLED KREMLIN ROOM. Heavy smoke from a short circuit filled a room in<br>
the Kremlin yesterday, but the problem was soon fixed and there was no fire.<br>
"For once, there was smoke without fire," President Boris Yeltsin's press<br>
secretary told a news conference. (AP, October 24)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
YELTSIN CALLS FOR END TO INFIGHTING. In his weekly radio broadcast today,<br>
President Boris Yeltsin appealed for national unity and said he intends to<br>
remain in office for his full four-year term. Speaking from the sanitarium<br>
where he is preparing for heart surgery, Yeltsin instructed his ministers to<br>
stop bickering and get back to work; those who continued to "electioneer"<br>
would be dismissed "without regrets," he warned. (BBC World Service, October<br>
25) Yesterday, Yeltsin's press secretary said the president had instructed<br>
him to deny the claim, made earlier in the week by former national security<br>
adviser Aleksandr Lebed, that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin would soon<br>
be fired. (AP, UPI, October 24) <br>
<p>
A week has passed since Lebed was sacked but there has been no let-up in<br>
Kremlin infighting. In an interview published in this week's Moscow News,<br>
Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov repeated his allegations that Lebed had<br>
mustered and armed a private security guard which, Kulikov said, was<br>
interfering in the efforts of the Interior Ministry to apprehend criminals<br>
in Moscow. Before leaving Moscow for a week's holiday, Lebed told<br>
journalists that Prime Minister Chernomyrdin had outlived his usefulness and<br>
predicted that he would be dismissed by the middle of November. Lebed said<br>
that both he and Chernomyrdin were victims of Presidential Chief of Staff<br>
Anatoly Chubais. Lebed's allegations were repeated by disgraced Kremlin<br>
security chief Aleksandr Korzhakov, who told a British newspaper that<br>
Yeltsin was being fed false information not only by Chubais but also by<br>
Yeltsin's daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko. Boris Yeltsin "has never liked to<br>
watch TV or listen to the radio," Korzhakov said. "Now that he is ill, I do<br>
not think he even reads the newspapers." (Moskovsky komsomolets, October 24)<br>
<p>
Many Russian commentators allege that Chubais is gradually taking control of<br>
the country. The Duma is working on a bill that would limit the powers of<br>
Yeltsin's administration, but the Kremlin has declared that such a bill is<br>
unconstitutional (the constitution says that the president forms his own<br>
administration without outside intervention, even by parliament) and that<br>
the president will veto any effort by parliament to interfere. (Nezavisimaya<br>
gazeta, October 23)<br>
<p>
IMF DELAYS LOAN TO RUSSIA. The International Monetary Fund is withholding<br>
the latest monthly tranche, worth $340 million, of its three-year $10<br>
billion loan to Russia. According to a statement issued yesterday by the<br>
Russian Central Bank, the IMF is concerned at the Russian government's<br>
inability to raise enough revenue to plug Russia's yawning budget deficit.<br>
The two sides will meet again in the first half of November, when the<br>
government is supposed to come up with fresh proposals for raising revenue.<br>
(UPI, Interfax, October 24) <br>
<p>
The IMF is apparently unimpressed by the special commission recently set up<br>
by the government to crack down on tax dodgers. Russian media commentators<br>
are also unimpressed. They point out that bankrupting firms is not a way to<br>
get money out of them, since bankrupt companies have no money by definition,<br>
and all the government will get by following that path is higher<br>
unemployment and social unrest. What is needed is structural reform of the<br>
tax system. The present system places a crippling burden (up to 90 percent<br>
of profits) on firms, discouraging enterprise and investment, while<br>
providing no tax incentives to encourage individual workers to increase<br>
productivity. The government is working on a new tax code that would shift<br>
some of the burden from firms to individuals, but the draft is not expected<br>
to be ready for presentation to parliament before the spring. (Nezavisimaya<br>
gazeta, October 23)<br>
<p>
MOSCOW INCHES CLOSER TOWARD AGREEMENT ON NATO ENLARGEMENT? In a broad<br>
overview of Moscow's foreign and security policies published recently in a<br>
Russian daily (s ee Monitor, October 24), Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov<br>
seems to signal that, despite its enduring opposition to NATO enlargement,<br>
Moscow may indeed be inching toward an accommodation with the Western<br>
alliance. "Russia does not confine itself to an excessively negative<br>
attitude toward NATO expansion," Primakov writes, "but is ready to conduct a<br>
constructive dialogue with the organization's member states in order to work<br>
out 'rules of conduct'... that would suit everybody." Primakov is quick to<br>
qualify that statement, however. First, he restates his often-expressed view<br>
that any agreement between Russia and the alliance must more than merely<br>
declaratory. That is, it must spell out in specific terms both "the<br>
character, scope, and mechanism of political consultations and political<br>
decisions" and establish "the lines and limits of Russia's participation in<br>
the alliance's military infrastructure." Primakov also says that the<br>
agreement must contain "an extensive mandate for negotiations on adapting<br>
the CFE Treaty to current conditions." <br>
<p>
Second, despite having just linked the two himself, Primakov attempts to<br>
decouple the issue of enlargement from that of Russia's relations with NATO.<br>
Moscow is desirous of a "special relationship" with NATO, but is clearly<br>
reluctant to let the formalization of that relationship be construed by NATO<br>
as a quid pro quo for the alliance's enlargement, let alone to "become a<br>
cover" for expansion. In the same vein, Primakov dismisses any talk of<br>
Russia itself joining NATO as "insidious" propaganda because, he argues, a<br>
Russian application for membership would legitimize the enlargement process<br>
but would undoubtedly not result in Moscow's admission. (Nezavisimaya<br>
gazeta, October 22) Primakov's remarks on NATO are noticeably absent any<br>
reference to former security chief Aleksandr Lebed's calls earlier this<br>
month for Moscow to participate aggressively in NATO's Partnership for Peace<br>
program as a means of exerting influence from within the alliance. In a more<br>
recent restatement of this view, Lebed observed convincingly that NATO is<br>
anything but monolithic, and that by failing to interact with the alliance<br>
Moscow is forfeiting any chance of influencing (or, perhaps, exploiting)<br>
significant differences of view among NATO member-states. (Trud, October 22.<br>
See also Monitor, October 8-10)<br>
<p>
EFFECTS OF NUCLEAR TEST FELT 40 YEARS LATER. On September 14, 1954, the<br>
Soviet Union conducted its 8th nuclear explosion, an atmospheric burst over<br>
the southern foothills of the Urals at the Totsk test site midway between<br>
what are now again called Orenburg and Samara. The Soviets made no<br>
announcement at the time, either to their own people or abroad, and it was<br>
the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission that in late October of that year made<br>
public the blast and the series that followed it. <br>
<p>
Two days ago, a conference on the impact of that explosion on the region<br>
ended in Orenburg. The conferees found that the affect on the health of the<br>
population was "lingering and severe." The mortality rate was found to be<br>
nearly twice as high as in other areas, and an abnormal number of children<br>
were said to suffer from genetic physical impairments. Conferees said that<br>
radioactive isotopes in the soil were up to five times the normal levels.<br>
The region was compared with Bryansk -- downwind from Chernobyl -- in the<br>
incidence and nature of genetic disorders in children and adults.<br>
(Itar-Tass, October 23)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
NO DEAL YET ON BLACK SEA FLEET. Yesterday's talks between Presidents Boris<br>
Yeltsin and Leonid Kuchma produced a demonstration of Ukraine's willingness<br>
to settle the Black Sea Fleet dispute even at the cost of additional<br>
concessions to Russia. The hospital-ward meeting, limited to a half-hour and<br>
partly devoted to expressions of good wishes to the ailing Yeltsin, could<br>
hardly have finalized a deal and did not appear to do so. Both presidents<br>
and their spokesmen announced that they expected the package of three<br>
agreements on the fleet to be signed by their prime ministers in Kiev by<br>
mid-November. However, there was no word on how to bridge the outstanding<br>
differences that the high-level October 22 talks preparatory to yesterday's<br>
meeting had failed to resolve (see Monitor, October 24). The two presidents<br>
yesterday tasked a working group, headed by Russian deputy prime minister<br>
Valery Serov and Ukrainian first deputy prime minister Vasyl Durdinets (who<br>
had also negotiated on October 22), to hold more talks during the weeks<br>
ahead "on the remaining problems." The most serious of those problems appear<br>
to include the terms for partitioning the fleet's coastal assets and<br>
infrastructure, apportioning Sevastopol's bays, and establishing the time<br>
frame and financial conditions for leasing bases in Ukraine to Russia.<br>
(Interfax, Itar-Tass, October 24) Kuchma, mindful that a final deal has<br>
previously proved elusive, told reporters: "We discussed the date (for<br>
signing a deal). Alas these dates have changed so many times in the past."<br>
(Reuter October 24)<br>
<p>
LINK TO POLITICAL TREATY. Kuchma stated after the meeting that Kiev's "sole<br>
wish" at this point is for Yeltsin to make a quick recovery so that he can<br>
sign the Russian-Ukrainian framework treaty on good-neighborly relations<br>
once the fleet dispute is resolved. "Ukraine's political elite wishes to<br>
resolve this problem," stated Kuchma, who appeared to link its resolution<br>
with Yeltsin's personal fortunes: "Yeltsin wants to get the operation behind<br>
him soon and return with full force to the political arena... Not only<br>
Russia but also Ukraine and the world need him." For his part, Yeltsin<br>
appeared to set the goal of a treaty-signing visit to Ukraine as a test of<br>
his capacity to recover physically. "I will be the one to sign that treaty<br>
when I get out of here," Yeltsin said in a fleeting TV appearance from the<br>
hospital. He added that his first foreign visit will be to Ukraine "after he<br>
is back in shape." Again, there was no word on how to settle the outstanding<br>
differences over the draft interstate treaty. (Interfax, Itar-Tass, Russian<br>
TV, October 24)<br>
<p>
Moscow conditions the signing of the political treaty on the prior<br>
resolution of the fleet dispute. But four years of negotiations on the<br>
political treaty have not yielded a definitive and unambiguous Russian<br>
recognition of Ukraine's borders and other attributes of independence. The<br>
uncertainties surrounding Yeltsin's health confront Kiev with the dilemma of<br>
either insisting on iron-clad treaty language, or of settling for less in<br>
order to have the treaty signed as soon as possible while Yeltsin is still<br>
in power. Recognition of Ukraine's borders by treaty has now acquired even<br>
greater urgency following the Russian Duma's latest statements on Crimea and<br>
Sevastopol.<br>
<p>
DUMA EXPLICITLY CLAIMS SEVASTOPOL FOR RUSSIA. With no votes against and no<br>
sign of dissent, Russia's Duma yesterday adopted an address to the Ukrainian<br>
parliament that made a direct claim to Sevastopol and, obliquely, to Crimea.<br>
The document argues that the Russian Federation is legal heir to the Russian<br>
Empire's and the USSR's sovereign title to Crimea and Sevastopol. It claims<br>
that the USSR leadership's 1954 transfer of Crimea from the RSFSR to the<br>
Ukrainian SSR was unlawful and anti-constitutional, and that in any case the<br>
transfer did not cover Sevastopol which -- the address asserts -- remains<br>
legally part of Russia. The Duma holds that "all of Ukraine's unilateral<br>
acts asserting its jurisdiction over Sevastopol can not be recognized as<br>
legal," and that Russia is the rightful holder of state jurisdiction over<br>
Sevastopol. (Itar-Tass, Interfax, October 24)<br>
<p>
The Duma's action attempts to upgrade the territorial claim from the<br>
political to the constitutional and state level. The Duma's key argument is<br>
that the 1954 transfer of Crimea to Ukraine did not mention, and<br>
consequently left standing, a 1948 decision to place Sevastopol under<br>
all-Union jurisdiction. Sevastopol, it alleges, was until the dissolution of<br>
the USSR subordinated to and financed by the USSR, not Ukraine. Russia is<br>
legal successor is the USSR. However, this argument would seem to refer to<br>
Sevastopol's naval base system, not to the city as a whole. The Ukrainian<br>
side correctly points out that after 1954 Sevastopol became one of two<br>
Ukrainian cities directly subordinated to republican authorities -- the<br>
other one being Kiev itself -- and that it was the Ukrainian state budget<br>
that financed Sevastopol's expenses. <br>
<p>
The Duma chose the day when Kuchma was in Moscow to adopt this document.<br>
"Where were the votes against? Where was [the pro-government deputies'<br>
group] "Russia is Our Home"? Where were the democrats?" Kuchma wondered<br>
aloud at his news conference. Days earlier, the Duma had almost unanimously<br>
adopted a bill on halting the partition of the Black Sea Fleet and claiming<br>
exclusive rights in Sevastopol. Indirectly answering Kuchma's rhetorical<br>
question, a statement in the name of the Yabloko faction yesterday<br>
disapproved of the two acts. But it did so only after Yabloko had failed to<br>
oppose them in the chamber. Yabloko's own Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the<br>
Duma's foreign affairs commission, justified the Duma's actions by<br>
suggesting that Duma deputies were frustrated with Ukraine for allegedly<br>
"torpedoing" agreements on the fleet. (Interfax-Ukraine, Western agencies,<br>
October 23 and 24)<br>
<p>
WHAT IS BEHIND THE RESIGNATION OF THREE UKRAINIAN ADMIRALS? Ukrainian<br>
officials are offering vague and contradictory explanations for the October<br>
23 resignations of naval commander-in-chief Volodymyr Bezkorovayny, his<br>
first deputy and chief of staff Mykola Kostrov, and deputy<br>
commander-in-chief Oleksy Ryzhenko. Two of the three admirals were said to<br>
have cited medical reasons for resigning. However, some Defense Ministry<br>
officials indirectly undermined that explanation by announcing that the<br>
ministry is considering other assignments for the three. Other officials of<br>
the same ministry claimed, without substantiation, that the admirals had<br>
objections to military reform or that they had performed poorly in their<br>
posts. National Security Council secretary Volodymyr Horbulin offered<br>
several, mutually inconsistent explanations, and concluded ultimately that<br>
the Ukrainian navy needs "fresh blood." President Leonid Kuchma hinted that<br>
he had asked the admirals to resign. (Interfax-Ukraine, UNIAN, Western<br>
agencies, October 23 and 24)<br>
<p>
The apparent official disarray suggests that the admirals were actually<br>
protesting against concessions to Russia in the fleet negotiations.<br>
Bezkorovayny and Kostrov have repeatedly commanded Ukrainian warships in<br>
joint exercises with U.S. and NATO naval forces. Bezkorovayny's last known<br>
public appearance was an address last week thanking the U.S. for<br>
co-financing the latest in a series of such exercises. (UNIAN, October 18)<br>
Days earlier, an unnamed Ukrainian official had listed in detail what he<br>
described as dangerous concessions being made to Russia in the latest drafts<br>
of the agreements on the Black Sea Fleet. (Interfax-Ukraine, October 9)<br>

WILL RUSSIA'S ECONOMY TURN INTO A "CRAZY QUILT?" <br>
By Mikhail Gershaft<br>
<p>
	At the end of March, elections were held for the presidency of the republic<br>
of Tatarstan, which is part of the Russian Federation and a place which was<br>
once a trouble spot. The only candidate, Mintimer Shaimiev, was reelected<br>
virtually unanimously. In an interview with Moscow television the day after<br>
the elections, he said that economic reforms in Tatarstan would continue, no<br>
matter what kind of government took power in the Kremlin, reformist or<br>
Communist.<br>
	We will leave the character, depth, and nomenklatura-driven nature of the<br>
market reforms underway in this republic, as in many other regions of<br>
Russia, for future analysis. Shaimiev's statement was made three months<br>
before Boris Yeltsin's July 3 victory over the Communists, when the outcome<br>
of the confrontation was still unclear, and moreover, when opinion polls<br>
were showing that the scales could tip against the incumbent president. <br>
        This statement did not reflect the personal bravery of the president<br>
of Tatarstan. What is significant here is what the statement says about the<br>
degree of independence of Russian regions in the spheres of political and<br>
especially, socio-economic, transformation.<br>
<p>
Regional Economics -- or the Economy of the Regions<br>
	One must recognize that in general, an increase in the role of regions and<br>
regional elites in the political-economic process always takes place during<br>
a crisis.<br>
	It has turned out that Russia's regions, which exist in a single economic<br>
space and within a single stream of centrally-implemented reforms, are<br>
nevertheless developing a market economy, or on the other hand, trying to<br>
resist its development, by various methods, and with differing results.<br>
There are many reasons for such divergence. Sometimes, success in<br>
implementing reforms at the local level is linked to a region's export<br>
orientation or its predominantly urban population, the victory of reformist<br>
forces in the regional elections, and sometimes it can be attributed to the<br>
factor of personality, or ethnic resistance to Moscow.<br>
	On the extreme free-market flank (if one may use such terms), there is<br>
Nizhny Novgorod and the surrounding oblast. Here, there are virtually no<br>
attempts to control the free formation of prices, to control the export of<br>
production outside the region, to introduce rationing for essential food<br>
products, or to increase local taxes excessively to fill the regional<br>
government's coffers. In the cities and the oblast, the level of<br>
privatization is highest of all in the service, trade, and food producing<br>
sectors; higher than the Russian average. This oblast is among the leaders<br>
in the number of large banks, insurance companies, and other financial<br>
institutions.<br>
	There have been profound changes in the agrarian sphere in the Nizhny<br>
Novgorod oblast. The oblast is a testing ground for international financial<br>
consulting organizations. And although the results of their recommendations<br>
have been slightly disappointing, due to the consultants' unfamiliarity with<br>
Russian and local conditions, the "image" of being a pro-market region has<br>
allowed Nizhny Novgorod to attract a significant number of investors and<br>
obtain international credits.<br>
	A subjective factor -- the role of the young technocrat-governor Boris<br>
Nemtsov, whom many reformers would like to see as a future president of<br>
Russia -- is also of no small significance here. The oblast administration<br>
has enabled -- or rather -- has tried not to hinder the course of the<br>
transition to the market, and has not tried to subordinate the market<br>
process to the administration. The reforms continue. The oblast<br>
administration proposes, in the course of three years, to lower the taxes on<br>
the profits of enterprises and banks, to lift taxes on export producers, and<br>
to simplify the tax system for small business.<br>
        Although the "Nizhny Novgorod model" is most popular, no less<br>
significant results have been achieved in other Russian regions --<br>
Chelyabinsk, Ekaterinburg, Samara, Tomsk, and Tyumen.<br>
	On the other extreme, you have the so-called "Ulyanovsk phenomenon." In the<br>
city and oblast where Vladimir Ilyich was born, its present leaders have<br>
succeeded, for a prolonged period of time, in maintaining low prices on food<br>
and other necessary goods. The region limits the export of goods produced in<br>
the oblast and bases its existence on internal self-sufficiency. The source<br>
of this policy is the implementation of administrative rule, additional<br>
taxation of businesses, redistribution of incomes, and the formation of<br>
special funds to subsidize prices for certain consumer goods. At times, the<br>
policies are simply economically illiterate. For example, in Nizhny Novgorod<br>
oblast, they "extracted" money for supporting the poor by introducing a<br>
sales tax and proposed a partial income redistribution. In Ulyanovsk, they<br>
introduced a profits tax, thus taking away a source of investment which was<br>
scanty to begin with.<br>
	This mechanism has appeared most obviously and sharply in the situation<br>
this summer in Primorsky krai in the Russia's Far East. The krai<br>
administration, for populist reasons, cut prices for coal and other energy<br>
sources in half for "its" businesses and consumers. In six months to a year,<br>
the coal mines, which, even without an "operation" like this, were running<br>
at a loss, began to experience difficulties in paying salaries, not to<br>
mention other things necessary for the normal functioning of any business.<br>
	The krai administration recommended, as always, to cover the losses by<br>
means of subsidies and payments from Moscow. But this time, the center,<br>
which had just succeeded in winning a previously unattainable victory over<br>
inflation, stood firm. Against the background of a real threat of starvation<br>
and under the pressure of unprecedentedly severe strikes, money was sent to<br>
the Primorsky krai, energy prices were raised, and the actions of the local<br>
administration were overruled by the president.<br>
	But this case revealed not only the cost and the consequences of regional<br>
"games" with prices and "flirtations" with the people, but also the strength<br>
of the regional elites and the reaction of the workers, who don't want to<br>
hear any explanations about the consequences of the operation of economic<br>
laws. Now, the governor of the Primorsky krai is proposing to hold a<br>
referendum on his powers, and on his pseudo-market policy. This means that<br>
he still considers himself to be strong, and is counting on the support of<br>
the people...<br>
	The events of 1992-1993 played a definite role in the confrontation between<br>
the center and the regions, when, during the hard-fought struggle between<br>
the president and the parliament, several regions stopped making payments to<br>
the federal budget completely. But the money withheld was used, not for<br>
investment, but for the populist goal of strengthening the local, newly<br>
formed elites.<br>
	Most regions, both in the content and the results of implemented market<br>
reforms, are to be found somewhere between these two poles. This is not to<br>
be taken literally, because some federation subjects are gradually "lifting<br>
their feet off the brakes," and a corrupt bureaucratic government apparatus<br>
is gradually "giving up," or, more accurately, "selling off" its defensive<br>
position, and is starting to issue licenses for firms, banks, and other<br>
financial institutions to open up. At the same time, even the most<br>
steadfastly "red" regions triumphantly welcome and try to recruit rich<br>
foreign investors, thus demonstrating the age-old Russian contradiction<br>
between harsh words which incite the population's xenophobia, on one hand,<br>
and pragmatic actions, nourished by foreign capital and their hopes for more<br>
employment and more goods for the local market, on the other.<br>
	But a region's "red," or even "pink," orientation tends to scare off<br>
potential Western investors. This often leads to contradictions between a<br>
region's political and economic elites. Thus, for example, the Ulyanovsk<br>
Automobile Factory (UAZ), which was trying to set up a joint venture with<br>
Mercedes-Benz, last year refused to pay additional taxes out of its income<br>
to support subsidized prices and help the regional administration create the<br>
impression of paternal care for the oblast's population.<br>
	On the other hand, the existence and development of market structures in<br>
what seem to be purely free-market regions is also marked by constant<br>
disagreements and confrontations with the regional authorities, which are<br>
always trying to subordinate these structures to themselves and lay claim to<br>
a significant share of their income, which they need in order to consolidate<br>
their power and prolong their existence. Bankers and businessmen constantly<br>
complain of the high-handed behavior of local officials, forced to cover any<br>
shortfalls of the regional budget and the ambition of their leaders.<br>
Unfortunately, one cannot say that regions which are carrying out<br>
free-market policies are any more prosperous than "conservative,<br>
pro-Communist" oblasts. If it were really so simple, people who lived in<br>
"conservative" regions would have voted for consistent reformers in the last<br>
elections, thus completing the process of forming a free market in Russia.<br>
On the contrary, real income statistics, calculated, for example, on the<br>
prices of 19 essential goods, show a clear superiority for Ulyanovsk oblast<br>
over Nizhny Novgorod oblast.<br>
	In Soviet times, the clout of the local authorities, and to a significant<br>
degree, the extent to which a region was "well-stocked" and prosperous,<br>
depended on how often the oblast's leader had been able to get in to see the<br>
General Secretary or some other Politburo member in charge of economic<br>
issues. These "imperial" traditions continue to this day. Clearly, these<br>
traditions serve to reinforce the inequality in the various regions'<br>
economic development. During the hard-fought presidential election campaign,<br>
Moscow flooded the regions with promises and privileges. In April, for<br>
example, Boris Yeltsin signed a decree, offering a five-year investment tax<br>
credit to defense industry enterprises in his native Sverdlovsk oblast. A<br>
little earlier, a number of enterprises in Tatarstan involved in civilian<br>
production were also granted a five-year tax credit in an directive signed<br>
by Viktor Chernomyrdin. After that, the difficulties in collecting taxes and<br>
meeting budget revenue targets became understandable. This is such a big<br>
problem now that Finance Minister Aleksandr Livshits has raised the question<br>
of abolishing all privileges granted during the campaign. But after the<br>
presidential elections come the regional elections, and a refusal to support<br>
the regional elites could lead to a victory for the national-Communist<br>
opposition. 	The regional economic picture of reformers battling<br>
conservatives on the map of Russia needs to be supplemented by the factor of<br>
the regions' export orientation and, in connection with this, their interest<br>
in keeping part of the income from these exports. Tatarstan has achieved its<br>
first, albeit small, successes in doing this. It has been permitted to keep<br>
the income from part of the oil it extracts and refines (about 20 percent)<br>
for its own needs.<br>
	But the interests of regions which live on subsidies from the center run<br>
counter to such a policy. Any sign of independence and any attempt on the<br>
part of a region to keep "budget resources" for itself, when such resources<br>
are scarce, leads to the source drying up for others. First Tatarstan, then<br>
Bashkortostan, and the republic of Yakutia-Sakha, which has built its<br>
prosperity on the mining and selling of diamonds, have won the right to keep<br>
a significant share of their export income for their own use. This year, a<br>
number of other federation "subjects" (not "national republics,") and<br>
oblasts are trying to win the same right for themselves. Economists have<br>
calculated that if Ekaterinburg alone wins the right to keep a quarter of<br>
its profit, it will lead to a 9 to 12 percent drop in total government<br>
revenue. The Sverdlovsk oblast chief of administration, Eduard Rossel, has<br>
pointedly stressed that the money would go towards developing the oblast<br>
itself, and not, as before, towards supporting the subsidized regions.<br>
	But these measures could be a delayed-action bomb. More and more regions<br>
are winning the right to redistribute their regions' income, which benefits<br>
them, while harming the federal treasury. On the other hand, regions use<br>
these resources for subsidizing prices, supporting pensioners and low-income<br>
people. Of course, by doing this, the regional elites win support in public<br>
opinion as fighters for their republic's or oblast's prosperity against the<br>
"voracious" center.<br>
	In addition, these measures enrich the local elites, and allow the<br>
bureaucratic administrative apparatus to swell unbelievably. At the same<br>
time, the low, subsidized prices began to lead to demands that people show<br>
their passports to prove that they are legal residents of the oblast before<br>
being permitted to buy things, and to other limitations. This leads to the<br>
virtual destruction of the single economic space, and economic separatism,<br>
and indicates movement not to the market, but "from" it.<br>
	The young Russian market is constantly shaken up by the struggle between<br>
the center and the regions for power and the property of the "tastiest"<br>
giant enterprises, the producers of nickel and aluminum, gold and diamonds,<br>
oil and timber, automobiles and arms. Naturally, the regional elites have no<br>
desire to give up to the insatiable center the packets of shares and<br>
"packets of power" that were left to them after all the muddle of the<br>
beginning of the 90s.<br>
	One can now add to the picture of regional economies and regional interests<br>
the factor of a region's economic specialty, its orientation, above all,<br>
towards the fuel and energy complex, the military-industrial complex, or the<br>
unprestigious and traditionally-forgotten consumer goods sector of the<br>
economy -- agricultural processing and light industry. As a rule, the<br>
leaders of the regional elites are recruited from the representatives of the<br>
branch of industry which is predominant in the region. These persons had<br>
close ties with the structures in Moscow governing these industries, and had<br>
been able to obtain privileges for their regions, which guaranteed them<br>
local support.<br>
	In structure and social origin, the regional elites are still the old<br>
late-Soviet, pre-perestroika ruling class, which has only partially been<br>
able to replenish itself with new people. But these elites have been able to<br>
adapt to the new political and economic conditions, and have serious grudges<br>
against, and disagreements with, Zyuganov's Communists. The local leaders do<br>
not wish to give up their power to them, or their property, whose<br>
redistribution would be inevitable in the event of a Communist victory.<br>
        Thus one may say that at the present time, the Russian economy is a<br>
rather colorful conglomerate of regional economies, each developing market<br>
reforms and institutions at a different level and a different pace. The<br>
elections of regional chiefs of administration, governors, and legislators<br>
taking place from September through December will be fought in this<br>
atmosphere. The Communists, who lost the presidential race, intend to take<br>
revenge in these elections. <br>
<p>
Preliminary Conclusions<br>
	The regions' political and administrative elites may have come from the<br>
party-economic nomenklatura, but they have no desire to see the Communists<br>
return to power, and do not desire to return to the bosom of the party.<br>
	Although Tatarstan is not one of the regions where elections will be held<br>
this fall and winter, its president obviously expresses the opinion of the<br>
leaders of these regional elites: that the Communist demands to increase the<br>
role of the state and to reexamine property relations will inevitably lead<br>
to a destabilization of the situation, a threat to their own power, and to<br>
the loss of the property that the representatives of the elites had taken<br>
such pains to amass.<br>
	The elites in the national republics which are "subjects" of the Russian<br>
Federation are especially concerned about the Communists' possible return to<br>
power. Mintimer Shaimiev has noted that at the May 1 (pro-Communist)<br>
demonstrations in Tatarstan's capital, Kazan, there were 50 red RSFSR flags<br>
with the hammer and sickle, and in Naberezhnye Chelny, the republic's second<br>
largest city -- there were 47, one white-blue-red flag of the Russian<br>
Federation, and not a single green-white-red flag of Tatarstan. "This<br>
example," in the words of the president of Tatarstan, "makes you think."<br>
	The situation in the national republics, although many of the elections for<br>
their leaders, as was stated above, have already been held, nevertheless is<br>
quite symptomatic. Yeltsin lost in seven of the ten national republics in<br>
the first round, getting from 20 to 37 percent of the vote. The local<br>
authorities saw the defeat of the incumbent president as not only a sign of<br>
dissatisfaction with their own governments, but also as a sign of<br>
disloyalty. According to the press, which quoted OSCE observers, many<br>
regions resorted to "stuffing the ballot box" in the second round of the<br>
presidential elections, or adopted measures which led to unprecedented<br>
results: an enormous number of votes unexpectedly went "for" Yeltsin, an<br>
inexplicable change of the voters' positions between June 16 and July 3. If,<br>
in the first round, Yeltsin won in only 18 out of Tatarstan's 60 raions, in<br>
the second round, he won 59 out of 60. Yeltsin's vote in the second round<br>
went up by almost 68 percent in Tatarstan, in Karachaevo-Cherkessia -- by<br>
90.7 percent, and in Dagestan, by more than 100 percent.<br>
	Thus, it is obvious that the regional elites as a whole, who in most cases<br>
have a Communist past, have almost completely adapted to existing conditions<br>
and even fear being seen as disloyal to the present government. If the<br>
romantic democratic opposition used to attack them for their<br>
party-nomenklatura origins, this argument will not hurt them now in their<br>
election campaigns.<br>
	It is worth noting that in the regions, as in Russia as a whole, no<br>
parties, in the traditional, organizational, sense of the word, have been<br>
formed. The "party of power" is really more like a clan formed around the<br>
leader and his entourage. This does not rule out, but rather presupposes,<br>
the possibility of infighting but these fights will most often take place<br>
"behind closed doors" and will result in compromises.<br>
	In spite of demonstrations of loyalty to Yeltsin, in the regional<br>
elections, the representatives of regional clans who are able to distance<br>
themselves sharply, and criticize the federal authorities, stand the best<br>
chance of winning. In principle, this will always be profitable, in view of<br>
the present inconsistency and contradictions of the Yeltsin Administration<br>
and its leader.<br>
	To run in  the gubernatorial elections under Communist slogans now would be<br>
counterproductive in most regions. But at the same time, criticism of the<br>
present federal authorities and distancing oneself from them is proving to<br>
be a winning policy.<br>
	In this regard, the most probable approach will be to adopt<br>
national-patriotic rhetoric, mixed with a little xenophobia and talk about<br>
internal economic self-sufficiency, while admitting the need for a "soft<br>
entrance into the market."<br>
	The pose will most likely be that of the "good manager" who does not play<br>
"dirty political games," defends the interests of his region in the fight<br>
against the federal authorities and has achieved an acceptable level of<br>
prosperity in the region.<br>
	It is interesting to note that two years ago, the magazine "Voprosy<br>
istorii" published the results of an analysis of letters from the regions of<br>
the Soviet Union to Moscow from the end of the 1920s to the beginning of the<br>
1930s. According to the historian who wrote the article, the authors of the<br>
letters were dissatisfied with the policies of the local authorities and<br>
were asking for help from the center. Nowadays, it's the other way around.<br>
The people not only have no hope of help from the center; they don't even<br>
think they can get an acceptable explanation of policies carried out by the<br>
center. In the traditional Russian mentality of "looking for an enemy," the<br>
center is now fit for the role. 	But the center, by coming to the defense of<br>
the "weak regions," can continue to carry out its policy, neutralizing the<br>
pressure and blackmail of the elites of the stronger regions.<br>
	Thus, the coming period can be characterized by the politicization of<br>
economic processes, and the solidity of the platform on which Russia's<br>
further economic development will take place will depend upon their outcome.<br>

ISLAM IN THE NORTHERN CAUCASUS<br>
By Aleksei Malashenko<br>
<p>
	The significance of Islam in the social and political life of the Northern<br>
Caucasus, which was still being debated by politicians and scholars as late<br>
as the early 1990s, is no longer in doubt today. The war in Chechnya, which<br>
the local separatists declared a jihad, and the partial introduction of the<br>
Shariat laws in the Chechen Republic in August 1996, dotted the final "i."<br>
But the influence of the "Islamic factor" is far from limited to Chechnya<br>
alone. It is quite noticeable in other North Caucasus republics as well,<br>
above all, in Dagestan...<br>
	The Northern Caucasus is one of the two main regions in the Russian<br>
Federation where Muslims are compactly settled. (The other, as is<br>
well-known, is the Volga region.) There are about 4 million Muslims here,<br>
and from 15 to 22 million in Russia as a whole, depending on which count you<br>
use.<br>
	Islam did not penetrate into the Northern Caucasus all at once. In the<br>
southern part of Dagestan, where it was introduced by the Arabs, Islam began<br>
to take root in the 7th century. By the 15th century, it was established in<br>
most of Dagestan, and only by the 15th-19th centuries did it penetrate<br>
further -- into the central and western regions of the Northern Caucasus --<br>
present-day Chechnya, Ossetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachai, and Cherkessia.<br>
	The establishment of Islam as the leading faith in the region was not<br>
always painless. In many cases, including in certain regions of Chechnya,<br>
Islam was established by force. One of Chechnya's most venerated heroes,<br>
Sheik Mansur, is known for his success at this type of "Islamization."<br>
	Sunni Islam is widespread in the Northern Caucasus, and its two most<br>
liberal branches, Hanifism and Shafiism, are represented in various regions<br>
of Dagestan.<br>
	At the beginning of the last century, the biggest Sufi brotherhoods --<br>
Nakshbandiya and Kadiriya -- took root in the Northern Caucasus, and<br>
continue to be influential to this day.<br>
	It is worth noting that Islam in the Northern Caucasus is of a syncretic<br>
character, assimilating elements of the [pre-Islamic] local religions, and<br>
the cult of the saints, while the Shariat coexists with the pre-Islamic<br>
local traditions and customary law, or Adat.<br>
	During the years of Soviet rule, although the influence of Islam on the<br>
lives of the peoples of the Northern Caucasus weakened, it continued to be<br>
noticeable on an everyday level, especially in rural areas. The authorities<br>
had an ambivalent attitude towards Islam and the Muslim clergy. On one hand,<br>
they waged atheist propaganda campaigns, closed the overwhelming majority of<br>
the mosques (in Dagestan, for example, out of the 2,060 mosques which had<br>
existed before the revolution, only 28 were left in 1980), and persecuted<br>
the clergy. On the other hand, especially in the 1920s, there were attempts<br>
to "adapt" Islam to the new political system, and even to its ideology.<br>
Conformist members of the clergy, in turn, gave pro-Soviet sermons,<br>
attempted to combine secular law with the norms of the Shariat, etc.<br>
	In Chechnya, there were pockets of armed resistance to Soviet rule (whose<br>
leaders interpreted their fight as a "holy war"), right up to the beginning<br>
of World War II.<br>
	In the postwar years, religious life was regulated by the Spiritual<br>
Administration [dukhovnoe upravlenie] of the Muslims of the Northern<br>
Caucasus, whose leaders were completely dependent on the center and<br>
fulfilled its instructions. At the same time, in mountain areas, Muslim<br>
communities lived in relative autonomy from the official religious<br>
structures. "Informal" religious authorities preserved the traditions of<br>
classical Islam, and succeeded in hiding from the godless authorities some<br>
of the Arabic-language religious literature which had reached the Northern<br>
Caucasus in the last century. It is interesting that the official clergy and<br>
the secular authorities, both of whom knew of the existence of this<br>
"parallel Islam," did not try to take measures against its adherents.<br>
	From the beginning of perestroika, as Soviet society liberalized, and<br>
continuing through the consequent disintegration of the Soviet Union, the<br>
role of Islam in the social and political lives of the peoples of the<br>
Northern Caucasus increased. This found concrete expression in two closely<br>
linked processes: the religious revival and the politicization of Islam.<br>
	One representative indicator of this Islamic revival is the opening of<br>
mosques previously closed by the Soviet authorities, and the building of new<br>
mosques. In Dagestan in 1995, there were, according to one count, 1,500<br>
mosques, and by another, over 5,000. In Kabardino-Balkaria, which is not<br>
known for its religious fervor, the number of mosques grew from two to nine.<br>
In 1994, a mosque was built in Adygeia, where all the mosques had been<br>
destroyed in the 1930s. Hundreds of mosques were in operation in Chechnya on<br>
the eve of the war.<br>
	But the number of mosques, which for many specialists and politicians is<br>
the most persuasive indicator of the religious revival, is, in a certain<br>
sense, only its consequence. If, at first, the opening of new mosques<br>
stimulated the growth in the religious activity of the faithful, later, the<br>
opening of new mosques, in turn, was made necessary by the needs of the<br>
Muslim communities. (Now, there is a well-known "surplus" of mosques,<br>
especially since more and more prosperous people are starting to have the<br>
desire to build "their own" mosque. Local inhabitants and specialists note<br>
that many mosques in the Northern Caucasus are not all that well-attended.)<br>
	In our view, a more weighty indicator of "re-Islamization" is the creation<br>
of a broad network of Muslim seminaries [medrese] and educational<br>
institutions. In Dagestan in 1995, there were more than 20 Islamic high<br>
schools and two Islamic universities. Religious primary schools exist<br>
everywhere. An authoritative Islamic institute has opened in Grozny.<br>
	In addition to local teachers, students are taught by people coming from<br>
other Muslim countries. Thousands of young people have received, and are<br>
still receiving, education in Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, Jordan,<br>
and Pakistan. A young educated generation of Muslim clergy is being formed<br>
relatively quickly, which will soon be ready to occupy important positions<br>
in public and religious life in the Northern Caucasus, and is already<br>
beginning to do so.<br>
	Each North Caucasus republic has its own religious newspapers and other<br>
periodical publications. (The first and most influential newspaper of this<br>
type is "Islamskie novosti," which first came out in 1990 in Makhachkala.)<br>
Quite a bit of religious literature is coming in from abroad, including many<br>
books by authors expressing radical, or even fundamentalist, views.<br>
	In the Northern Caucasus, one notices, ever more clearly, the tendency to<br>
transform the former Soviet (or quasi-Soviet) identity into another, in<br>
which its religious, Islamic affiliation becomes the dominating factor. (By<br>
the way, this process is taking place on a more limited scale in Tatarstan<br>
as well.)<br>
	But the resurgence of the Islamic mentality does not at all mean that the<br>
level of ethnic consciousness is diminishing. The sense of belonging to the<br>
same religion coincides with a recognition of one's own ethnicity. Islam, in<br>
spite of the presence of tendencies toward Islamic solidarity, is split, as<br>
it were, into ethno-national camps. The split of the single Spiritual<br>
Administration of Muslims of the Northern Caucasus into separate branches<br>
for each republic, and especially, the formation of four "spiritual<br>
administrations" in Dagestan, along ethnic lines, is evidence of this.<br>
	The politicization of Islam, as shown by the secular authorities' appealing<br>
to Islam, and most of all, in the activity of Islamic parties and<br>
organizations, has become a factor in the Islamic revival in the Northern<br>
Caucasus, just as it has in all other Muslim countries and regions of the<br>
former USSR. Since in Islam, unlike other world religions, there is no<br>
strict distinction between spiritual and secular, and its adherents see it<br>
as a way of life, one may say that it is "legitimate" to appeal to Islam in<br>
one's social and political activity.<br>
	An appeal to Islam by the administration of an avowedly secular state, in a<br>
certain sense, is motivated by its desire to obtain additional legitimacy<br>
and authority in the eyes of the population. And, looking at it from a<br>
simple, "common sense" point of view, any ruler in a Muslim country,<br>
especially if he is a Muslim himself, is obliged, from time to time, to<br>
demonstrate his adherence to the common faith. (It is well-known that even<br>
under Soviet rule, many leaders, in situations where it was convenient and<br>
safe to their career, demonstrated their faithfulness to Muslim tradition.<br>
We may note that Islam provides for "takiya," -- concealing one's true views<br>
in the interests of the Muslim community, which could always serve for the<br>
local Communist rulers, who came from a Muslim environment, as a<br>
justification for their apostasy.)<br>
	For secular leaders, appealing to Islam has a rather multi-faceted<br>
character, ranging from introducing the Shariat in the Chechen insurgents'<br>
military units (which will be discussed later) to the financing of mosques<br>
from local government budgets, the organization of pilgrimages [hajj] to<br>
holy places, and the inclusion of "religious instruction" in school curricula.<br>
	In the 1990s, Islamic parties and organizations began to appear in the<br>
Northern Caucasus. The first of these was the all-Union Islamic Revival<br>
party [IRP], established in June 1990, which first took root in the region<br>
among the Avar ethnic group in Dagestan. Akhmed-kadi Akhtaev, a doctor by<br>
education, was elected the first Amir (leader) of the IRP. Soon after it was<br>
formed, the IRP's activity spread into many republics and regions. After the<br>
breakup of the USSR, the IRP's branches in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan were<br>
reformed into independent national parties. In the Caucasus, in spite of the<br>
efforts of Akhtaev and his supporters, especially the brothers Bagauddin and<br>
Ilias Kebedov, the party's influence was limited to northern and central<br>
Dagestan, where it had about 5,000 members. We may note that the IRP, a<br>
religious political organization, was registered by the republic's Ministry<br>
of Justice, in violation of Russian law, which requires the separation of<br>
church and state.<br>
	In 1991, the Organizational Committee of the IRP was registered in Moscow.<br>
The party managed to hold a series of regional conferences, to put out<br>
several issues of the newspaper Vakhdat, (which was soon renamed Edinstvo<br>
[Unity]); its leaders systematically spoke out in the central press...<br>
Nevertheless, the IRP never succeeded in becoming the basis for an<br>
all-Union, or all-Russian, Muslim movement. In 1994, the party "disappeared"<br>
from the all-Russian political arena. Its activists tried to shift its focus<br>
to Dagestan, but were no longer in any condition to exert any substantial<br>
influence on the situation in the republic.<br>
	In 1990, the Islamic Democratic party [IDP] was formed in Dagestan, which<br>
tried, in its ideology and practice, to unite the ideas of Islamic revival<br>
and the democratic reorganization of Russia. The IDP's chairman, Abrashit<br>
Saidov (like Akhtaev, a doctor by profession) criticized communism in its<br>
newspaper, Dagestan, and emphasized its incompatibility with Islam and<br>
democracy. In the early 90s, the IDP supported Boris Yeltsin in every way it<br>
could. Saidov himself ran for deputy of the USSR Supreme Soviet against<br>
Ramazan Abdulatipov, a prominent politician who later became chairman of the<br>
Supreme Soviet's Council of Nationalities.<br>
	In 1993, the IDP split: a group of parties, led by former athlete Surakat<br>
Asiyatilov, demanded that the IDP develop more of an Islamic "accent" in its<br>
ideology, and simultaneously, that it demonstrate more support for<br>
Dagestan's leadership. Saidov was removed from his post and became a<br>
political commentator. After his departure, the IDP was renamed the Islamic<br>
party.<br>
	Everywhere in the Northern Caucasus, small groups are forming, at times<br>
claiming to speak for all of Dagestan, or all of the Northern Caucasus, but<br>
whose activity is actually limited to a single ethnic group, local region,<br>
or even a small village. In their programs (if they have programs at all),<br>
calls for an Islamic revival and appeals to ethno-cultural identity both<br>
take a prominent place, which at times are seen as one and the same thing by<br>
these parties and circles. The "Islamic Way" party, which appeared in<br>
Chechnya in 1990, which is headed by one of Chechen separatist leader Djohar<br>
Dudaev's former allies, and later, his opponent, Bislan Gantamirov, is an<br>
organization of this sort.<br>
	With the intensification of the conflict in Chechnya, the role of Islam as<br>
a political factor in the Northern Caucasus began to grow. This was made<br>
possible by a number of circumstances:<br>
<p>
* the Chechen separatists' desire to present their action as a jihad against<br>
Russia;<br>
* their appeal to the idea of Islamic solidarity;<br>
* the aid (albeit limited) which they received from several Muslim countries;<br>
* and finally, the attempt of a number of politicians, both in Russia and in<br>
Chechnya, to present this conflict as part of a broader confrontation<br>
between Christians and Muslims.<br>
<p>
	Of course, one must not exaggerate the significance of the "Islamic factor"<br>
in this conflict, but it is also dangerous to ignore it completely.<br>
	It is clear that even Djohar Dudaev did not, at first, try to politicize<br>
Islam. He was constantly changing his mind on the significance of religion,<br>
and had been leaning towards the view that a secular form of government<br>
would be established in a future independent Chechen state. In one of his<br>
interviews, he said that "Russia forced us into Islam."<br>
	Nevertheless, the logic of resistance, and the rebel leaders' search for<br>
the optimal ideology more or less forced them to appeal to Islam. One of the<br>
main tenets of this ideology is the assertion that Russia's war against<br>
Chechnya is part of a broader Islamic-Christian conflict -- an idea which,<br>
as one may easily guess, is shared by the "hawks" in Moscow. Of course, it<br>
would be incorrect to reduce the whole ideology of the Chechen resistance to<br>
Islam alone, but all the same, its "religious accent" is becoming more<br>
pronounced.<br>
	The introduction of Shariat courts in Chechnya, which, so far, are limited<br>
to military formations, also leads us to this conclusion. This measure was,<br>
to a significant degree, forced: the Chechen leaders think that this was the<br>
reason why they were able to make their fighters and field commanders more<br>
law-abiding and governable. At the same time, the legitimization [of the<br>
Shariat] has been met with a significant amount of protest in society. There<br>
are known cases where relatives of fighters who have been punished by these<br>
courts have promised to take revenge on the judges and the executioners.<br>
	The influence of Islam on the social and political situation in the<br>
Northern Caucasus is now already well-established. Society is gradually<br>
"re-identifying" itself and the Soviet mentality is gradually being replaced<br>
by an ethno-religious mentality. All of this was fostered both by the<br>
historical fate of the region, which, from the religious point of view,<br>
belongs to the Muslim world, and by the rather tense present situation,<br>
linked to the war in Chechnya, which, to a greater or lesser extent, is<br>
attracting the attention of the Muslim world.<br>

ONE WOMAN'S CHOICE<br>
by Yelena Dikun<br>
<p>
	Ella Pamfilova entered politics on the crest of the first democratic wave<br>
in 1989, when she was elected a deputy of the USSR Supreme Soviet. In the<br>
country's highest legislative body, she was remembered for her clear voice,<br>
her sincerity, and her high ideals. The young charming woman waged a<br>
constant battle against the special privileges enjoyed by the party elite. <br>
	In 1991, she was appointed minister of social security of the population in<br>
the "government of reformers" headed by Yegor Gaidar. For three years,<br>
Pamfilova tried to solve the most difficult Russian problem -- the social<br>
problem.<br>
	But in 1994, Ella Aleksandrovna left the government "of her own volition,"<br>
slamming the door behind her on the way out. At the time, she publicly<br>
declared that all Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's assertions that the<br>
economy had become "socially-oriented" were nothing but pure window-dressing.<br>
	After her resignation, Ella Pamfilova returned to her post as deputy, and<br>
in the State Duma, continued to work on social problems. The need is<br>
certainly there. There are 2.7 million unemployed in Russia today. In the<br>
half of 1996, the average monthly income of a worker was 714,000 rubles, and<br>
the average pensioner received 271,000 rubles a month. The minimum<br>
subsistence level was 364,000 rubles per person per month. Thus, 34.9<br>
million people, i.e., 24 percent of the population, have incomes below the<br>
minimum subsistence level.<br>
	Ella Pamfilova knows how hard it is for ordinary people to make ends meet<br>
-- and not just from the statistics. Although two and a half years have<br>
passed since she left her post as minister of social security, and became an<br>
ordinary deputy, she gets dozens of letters a day in which people describe<br>
their sorrows and misfortunes. <br>
	Here are just a few of them:<br>
<p>
	* "I am 67 years old, I am very sick, I can't walk, and I live alone. My<br>
husband died two years ago. My pension is 135,000 rubles a month. How is it<br>
possible to live on this money? 35,000 goes to rent, electricity, and the<br>
telephone bill. I can't afford to eat anything but bread. I have worked for<br>
43 years, I'm a certified veteran of labor, and what do I have to show for<br>
it? Not even a garden plot to call my own. The government promised that they<br>
would increase the pensions of people who worked during the war and had<br>
medals. But they haven't done it. When will the people at the top understand<br>
that people are starving and dying every day? Please, I beg you, show my<br>
letter to Chernomyrdin. Perhaps he'll take pity on me. I deserve better."<br>
Anna Vasilieva, Syzran, Samara oblast.<br>
<p>
	* "I am a retired woman, born in 1932, without much in the way of property.<br>
My pension is 127,000 rubles a month. I am a certified veteran of labor. I<br>
have worked for 29 years. I was an engineer-economist, and now it has turned<br>
out that I have only earned enough for bread and kasha. Meat is now only a<br>
distant memory. Even the smell of the neighbors' food coming through the<br>
window is almost too rich for me now. I am in constant need of medication --<br>
I suffer from an irregular heartbeat, and my feet hurt -- but I don't have<br>
the money for it. I can't say that things were good before -- even then, we<br>
had to count every kopek -- but then, at least, we were warmed by the hope<br>
that we would see a 'radiant future' in our lifetimes. I don't blame<br>
anybody, I don't blame the government for it, but I can't hang on like this<br>
for long. Please, I beg of you, help me if you can." Lidia Subbotina, Essentuki.<br>
<p>
	* "We are retired weavers from the mills of Ivanovo, where there are many<br>
people unemployed and poor. If you only knew how unbearable it is to live in<br>
poverty. Just as during the war, we can't get enough to eat. We're sick of<br>
seeing that the store shelves are full -- but not for someone whose<br>
pocketbook is as empty as ours: our pensions are only 100-150,000 rubles a<br>
month. Our clothes are all threadbare, but we never buy new clothes; the<br>
prices are outrageous, and our pensions are only enough for bread, milk,<br>
potatoes, and rent and utilities. The new 'Bogorodskoye' cemetery filled up<br>
in just a year and a half, and those fields were enormous. People are dying<br>
like flies, since only one out of 100 can buy medicine at 30,-50,000 a pack.<br>
They've taken everything away from retired people: our food, our friends (we<br>
have nothing to serve them when they come to visit), the movies, the<br>
bathhouse, the beauty parlor.  To be frank, we no longer believe in anyone<br>
or anything, and we'll die before things get any better. We won't even have<br>
enough for our funerals. For ten years, I salted away 'funeral money.' Now<br>
the money I've saved wouldn't buy anything more than half a kilo of the<br>
cheapest variety of sausage." Nina Smirnova, Ivanovo.<br>
<p>
	* "I am just 20 years old, but my life is already over. At the age of 18, I<br>
got called up and went to serve in the army. I served 400 days and was badly<br>
wounded 'while performing my soldierly duty.' Now, I am a first-class<br>
invalid. I can't roll over without help. I can't even lift a spoon to my<br>
mouth, and now I use my head to help my hand write this letter. I have not<br>
received any compensation for my ruined health. All I was given was a<br>
miserable pension. The government turned me, a healthy young man, into a<br>
helpless freak. I disgust even myself. But I could have been a miner or an<br>
engineer, a banker or a driver. If the government doesn't want to help those<br>
who have suffered through its own fault, then it would have been better if<br>
they had just put us to sleep, like stray dogs. Consider this letter to be<br>
my official request for euthanasia." Vladimir Kalyuzhny, Donetsk-3, Rostov<br>
oblast.<br>
	<br>
	"If people put their hopes and expectations in me, then I am simply obliged<br>
to do my best to live up to them," says Ella Pamfilova. "But the door to the<br>
executive branch structures is barred to me now: in the first place, I don't<br>
expect anything good from the present government, and second, I have broken<br>
relations with them for good. But that actually makes it easier for me. I<br>
can do and say whatever I think necessary."<br>
	Ella Pamfilova really does have unique experience in social problems. She<br>
passed through the "school of hard knocks" at the factory to which she was<br>
assigned after graduating from the Moscow Energy Institute. She worked there<br>
as a foreman, and developed a new procedure for repairing equipment for the<br>
electrical power plants in Moscow and the Moscow oblast. She headed a shop<br>
of 120 employees: some of whom had prison records. But these "tough" men<br>
elected this "weak" woman to be chairman of the factory trade union<br>
committee. And after that, at the Congress of Energy and Electrical Workers,<br>
she was nominated to run for deputy of the USSR Supreme Soviet. There were<br>
eleven other candidates on the list, all of them men, but Pamfilova once<br>
again prevailed.<br>
	Not long ago, I asked Ella Pamfilova why she doesn't take up the fight<br>
against privileges again, the fight in which she "made her name" when she<br>
was a deputy of the USSR Supreme Soviet. She answered: "Because the nature<br>
of these privileges has changed. We are no longer talking about special<br>
rations or special stores, but of abuse of power, and the settling of<br>
personal accounts and the building up of spheres of influence under the<br>
guise of 'fighting corruption.' A cynical redistribution of property is<br>
taking place. In a word, the character of the ruling elite has not changed.<br>
It's the same old corrupt, elitist, nomenklatura-bureaucratic swamp, in<br>
which everything worthwhile sinks and drowns."<br>
	Pamfilova says that when she was appointed minister of social security of<br>
the population, she naively thought that if she did something good, no one<br>
would oppose it.<br>
	Now, looking back on her time in Yegor Gaidar's government, Pamfilova<br>
admits that she had no clear conception of that government's political<br>
course. That government had its "intellectual wing" -- Yegor Gaidar,<br>
Aleksandr Shokhin, Petr Aven, Anatoly Chubais, and she had a secondary role.<br>
	But soon she understood that it was impossible for her to work like that.<br>
The problems kept snowballing: the collapse of the social security system,<br>
the liberalization of prices, delays in the payment of salaries and<br>
pensions. Then, in Ella Pamfilova's words, she began to think about cause<br>
and effect.<br>
	Ella Aleksandrovna does not deny that she probably made mistakes in her<br>
ministerial post, out of inexperience or romanticism, but, at times, she is<br>
blamed for too much. For example, some people think that she was the one who<br>
was behind the subordination of the pension fund to the government (it had<br>
been subordinated to the Supreme Soviet,) and that this, in the final<br>
analysis, was what made it run out of money. In fact, things happened a<br>
little differently. It came to Pamfilova's attention that money from the<br>
pension fund, (which was controlled by Ruslan Khasbulatov at the time) was<br>
being spent on arms for Chechnya. She reported this information to the<br>
president, and asked him to do something about it. An enormous sum of money<br>
had been concentrated in the pension fund and she saw her task as being to<br>
establish strict control over this money and to spend it rationally. This<br>
was to be the role of government. The fact that the government used to<br>
fulfill its obligations and make its payments to the fund on time, and now<br>
"liquidates" its pension debts the same way it does its payroll debts, i.e.,<br>
by delaying them for months, is another matter entirely...<br>
	Ella Pamfilova handed in her resignation from her ministerial post twice.<br>
The first time was after Yegor Gaidar was forced out of the government in<br>
late 1992. <br>
At that time, Yeltsin was able to persuade her to stay.<br>
	When Pamfilova submitted her resignation for the second time in 1994, she<br>
had a clearer reason: the reforms weren't moving forward, what went under<br>
the name of "reform" was nothing but a travesty. The raw-material producers<br>
were cynically and ignorantly tearing the country apart.<br>
	At that time, she submitted her resignation several times, but the papers<br>
always managed to get lost. Finally, however, the president gave in, but<br>
only under the condition that she would continue to work on social problems.<br>
A Council on Social Policy was formed under the presidential administration,<br>
and Pamfilova was appointed to head it. She and her small staff worked all<br>
summer and prepared an effective anti-poverty program. This was not just a<br>
statement of principles but a plan to reform wage and employment policies,<br>
tying them to investment and modernization. But when the Council presented<br>
its proposal to the government, it was told in no uncertain terms that they<br>
had no need of it.<br>
	Later, in November 1994, when the first provocation had taken place in<br>
Chechnya, Pamfilova set off for Grozny with three other Duma deputies. When<br>
they came back, Ella Pamfilova spoke quite sharply on television, on the<br>
"Podrobnosti" [Details] program, saying that the Security Council had become<br>
a collective maniac committing senseless murders, and that she hoped that<br>
the president would have nightmares about the children who were dying in the<br>
bombing raids. After that statement, the Council on Social Policy was<br>
quietly dissolved. Ella Aleksandrovna read about it in the press...<br>
	Ella Pamfilova had always been a loyal and devoted supporter of Yegor Gaidar<br>
but at the end of 1994, Pamfilova left Gaidar's faction. She explained her<br>
decision by saying that Russia's Choice had adopted a policy of appeasement<br>
towards the government. The straw which broke the camel's back was Anatoly<br>
Chubais' behavior when he agreed to take the job of first vice-premier<br>
without consulting with the faction first. "How can I understand a<br>
situation," asked Pamfilova, "in which democrats are leaving the government<br>
because it is impossible for them to work there, and reforms are being<br>
rolled back, and after all this, Chubais goes and" [enters it.]<br>
	There have been several times in Ella Pamfilova's political career in which<br>
she has tried to "build bridges" between rival male democratic leaders. For<br>
example, at the very beginning of the presidential campaign, she tried to<br>
convene a forum of democratic forces to nominate a single candidate for<br>
president. Pamfilova then held a series of negotiations with Yegor Gaidar,<br>
Grigory Yavlinsky, Boris Fedorov and others. They all warmly supported the<br>
idea in words, but, as is well-known, nothing came of it.<br>
	In spite of the fact that Pamfilova's efforts have often met with a wall of<br>
misunderstanding and indifference, she still maintains, if not romanticism,<br>
then a certain  optimism. This optimism is based on the conviction that<br>
Russians are a clever and unusually talented people. "Yes, things are bad<br>
for people. Their salaries are not being paid on time, there's corruption<br>
all around, crime is rampant, but people understand that now, at least, they<br>
have a chance to do something on their own. Quietly, more and more people<br>
are squeezing the slave out of their souls, bit by bit. Once you have enough<br>
of such people, they will no longer allow the government to behave so<br>
high-handedly," Ella Pamfilova believes.<br>

NEWS:<br>
<p>
RUSSIA'S FINANCE MINISTER SAYS BUDGET IN TROUBLE. Finance Minister Aleksandr<br>
Livshits told the Russian Duma yesterday that falling revenues will leave<br>
the federal budget 25 percent underfinanced for the coming year despite the<br>
government's best efforts to raise tax collection and tighten spending.<br>
(UPI, October 23 See Perspective item below) His underlying message was that<br>
the government cannot meet parliament's demand to rework the 1997 federal<br>
budget. Last week, the Duma rejected the draft, demanding that the<br>
government increase planned social spending and industrial investment.<br>
<p>
IMF RUMORED TO BE CONSIDERING WITHHOLDING LATEST TRANCHE OF LOAN TO RUSSIA.<br>
Unconfirmed reports from Moscow say that the IMF is on the verge of<br>
abandoning negotiations with the Russian government and withholding the<br>
latest monthly tranche of its $10.1 billion extended Fund facility. A team<br>
of IMF experts now in Moscow is said to be unimpressed by the government's<br>
efforts to increase tax collection. (BBC World Service, October 24) The IMF<br>
withheld the tranche in July for the same reason. <br>
<p>
KULIKOV DOCUMENTS HIS ALLEGATIONS AGAINST LEBED. Russian interior minister<br>
Anatoly Kulikov has submitted to the Procurator General documents to support<br>
his allegations that Aleksandr Lebed had been building a private army and a<br>
parallel General Staff. (RTR, October 23) Kulikov's charge that Lebed was<br>
planning to seize power in a coup d'etat led to Lebed's dismissal as<br>
Security Council secretary. At the time, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin<br>
said there was some truth to the allegations concerning the formation of a<br>
"Russian legion," but dismissed the possibility of a coup.<br>
<p>
YELTSIN TO NAME NO NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER. Boris Yeltsin's press<br>
secretary reported on October 22 that the Russian president had decided<br>
against naming a new national security advisor to replace the departed<br>
Aleksandr Lebed. Yeltsin reportedly said that new Security Council secretary<br>
Ivan Rybkin would fulfill that role in the course of his normal activities<br>
as a "member of the presidential team." (Interfax, October 22)<br>
<p>
RUSSIA AND INDIA CLOSE TO ARMS DEAL; SIGN DEFENSE AGREEMENT. Quoting<br>
informed sources in the Indian Defense Ministry, a Russian news agency<br>
reported on October 21 that the government in New Delhi has approved a deal<br>
to buy 40 Russian Su-30 fighters for $1.8 billion. Russian defense minister<br>
Igor Rodionov is currently in New Delhi and yesterday signed an agreement<br>
with his Indian counterpart that provides for wide-ranging cooperation<br>
between the militaries of the two countries. (Itar-Tass, October 21; October 23)<br>
<p>
CHINA LOOKS TO BUY MORE SU-27S. China might buy 55 more Sukhoi Su-27 jet<br>
fighters, according to a "well-informed source" at the Seoul, Korea air<br>
show. The Chinese Air Force already has 48 of the modern jets, and has a<br>
license to build the plane itself. But Chinese production will not begin<br>
until after the turn of the century. (Itar-Tass, October 23)<br>
<p>
LUKASHENKO-GAZPROM ENTENTE CORDIALE. Construction work began yesterday on<br>
the Belarus stretch of the giant Yamal-Hamburg pipeline, which will carry 68<br>
billion cubic meters of Siberian gas annually to West European consumers.<br>
Speaking at the inaugural ceremony, Belarus president Aleksandr Lukashenko<br>
and Gazprom chairman Rem Vyakhirev both stressed that the Belarus stretch<br>
has the additional significance of providing a political link between<br>
Belarus and Russia. Vyakhirev praised Lukashenko as "the leading integrator<br>
in the CIS." Belarus has piled up almost $300 million in debts to Gazprom<br>
this year. (Interfax, October 23)<br>
<p>
UN URGES POSTPONEMENT OF ABKHAZ ELECTION. The UN Security Council has<br>
adopted a statement asking Abkhazia to call off the parliamentary election<br>
scheduled for next month. Elections can not be legitimately held until<br>
Abkhazia has a political status consistent with Georgia's sovereignty and<br>
territorial integrity. The Council called on both sides, "particularly the<br>
Abkhaz side," to resume negotiations and to achieve significant progress on<br>
a comprehensive political settlement. (Western agencies, October 22 and 23)<br>
The statement follows strong Georgian complaints over UN passivity and, most<br>
recently, pro-Abkhaz signals inconsistent with its mediating role.<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT GETS TOUGH WITH TAX LAGGARDS. Russia's new commission for<br>
enforcing tax discipline has launched a high-profile campaign aimed at<br>
frightening Russian companies into paying overdue taxes. Following the<br>
commission's first meeting on October 22, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin<br>
warned four of the country's largest companies that they will face<br>
bankruptcy proceedings if they do not pay their tax arrears within 24 hours.<br>
The hit-list included the Krasnodar oil refinery, the Moskvich auto company,<br>
the KamAZ truck plant and the Achinsk aluminum plant. Each is said to have<br>
paid less than ten percent of its taxes. Two of the companies are contesting<br>
the ultimatum: KamAZ says it was granted a tax break by presidential decree,<br>
while the Krasnodar oil refinery says taxes on its industry are unbearably<br>
high. (Itar-Tass, Reuters, AP, October 22; BBC World Service October 23)<br>
<p>
There is widespread agreement that the four companies have been picked on in<br>
an effort to frighten other companies into paying up. Chubais claimed that<br>
17 companies were on the original hit-list and that the four remaining are<br>
hard-core nonpayers. But the press has pointed out that other persistent tax<br>
laggards have escaped attention because of their political connections.<br>
Conspicuously absent are Norilsk Nickel, which was acquired by Oneksimbank<br>
last year at a time when First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Potanin was<br>
president of the bank, and the auto giant AvtoVAZ, which owes more in back<br>
taxes than any other Russian company but which also has influential<br>
government patrons. (Nezavisimaya gazeta, Kommersant-daily, October 16)<br>
<p>
Chernomyrdin said urgent measures must be taken to improve tax collection.<br>
First deputy chairman of the commission, Anatoly Chubais, who is believed to<br>
be the originator of the present campaign, said only 45 percent of planned<br>
budget revenues had been collected so far this month. Chubais has always<br>
been seen as tough on tax issues and his ouster from the government in<br>
January was interpreted by many companies at the time as a sign that they<br>
could stop paying. But while the slump in tax payments in the first six<br>
months of this year was attributed to the approach of the presidential<br>
election, the government has been dismayed to find that payments have not<br>
improved in the election's aftermath. The government urgently needs revenue<br>
to pay wage arrears and to ward off strikes. A nationwide day of protest is<br>
set for November 5.<br>
<p>
JITTERS IN THE KREMLIN AS YELTSIN'S ACTIVITIES DECLINE. Russian media have<br>
begun to speculate over an October 23 visit by Prime Minister Viktor<br>
Chernomyrdin and Presidential Chief of Staff Anatoly Chubais to the<br>
headquarters of the Federal Security Service on Moscow's Lubyanka Square.<br>
This was Chernomyrdin's first visit to former KGB headquarters and followed<br>
the decision by Russia's ailing President Yeltsin to transfer oversight of<br>
the "power ministries" to his prime minister. The media are interpreting the<br>
visit as a sign of Kremlin jitters that the secret police might exploit<br>
Yeltsin's increasing inactivity and absence from the political scene to<br>
intervene in the political process. The little that was officially reported<br>
of Chernomyrdin's discussions seems to bear out that interpretation. "Some<br>
individuals and groups are exploiting the processes of democratization and<br>
transformation to create extremist, armed, or terrorist formations<br>
representing a threat to society and the state," Chernomyrdin was quoted as<br>
saying. He was not just talking about Chechnya, the media concluded, for he<br>
went on to speak of the seductive temptation of "superficially easy<br>
solutions, such as 'the iron hand,' to resolve complex problems." (RTR,<br>
October 23)<br>
<p>
RYBKIN'S MEETING WITH ZAVGAEV MAY SIGNAL HARDENING OF RUSSIAN POSITION.<br>
Newly-appointed Security Council secretary Ivan Rybkin met yesterday with<br>
the head of the pro-Moscow Chechen government, Doku Zavgaev. (Interfax,<br>
October 23) Rybkin's predecessor, Aleksandr Lebed, pointedly avoided all<br>
contact with Zavgaev, and the fact that Zavgaev was not even invited to<br>
negotiations on the Chechen crisis indicated that Lebed's low view of<br>
Zavgaev's usefulness was shared by others in the Kremlin. Since Lebed's<br>
ouster, however, the Kremlin has begun again to recognize Chechnya's puppet<br>
leader. <br>
<p>
Rybkin and Zavgaev discussed the need to carry out the agreements reached<br>
between the federal side and the Chechen opposition, particularly those<br>
dealing with the rebels handing over their arms and disbanding their<br>
"illegal armed formations." They also discussed the coalition government<br>
formed by the opposition. They emphasized that all political forces in the<br>
republic -- and not just the opposition -- should be part of this government.<br>
<p>
In essence, Rybkin agreed, although not openly, with Zavgaev's criticism of<br>
Lebed's peacemaking activity. Zavgaev, for his part, found the new Security<br>
Council secretary "well-informed about the situation in the republic and the<br>
forces behind the conflict." (Interfax, October 23) This apparently<br>
insignificant phrase takes on added meaning in light of Zavgaev's earlier<br>
complaints that Lebed was poorly-informed and did not understand the nature<br>
of the conflict. <br>
<p>
It is unlikely, however, that any hardening of the Kremlin's position will<br>
seriously influence developments in the republic. On October 23 the last<br>
unit of the 104th Airborne Division left Chechnya. Only the 205th Motorized<br>
Infantry Division and scattered units from the North Caucasus Military<br>
District remain. (Interfax, October 23) Chechnya is now almost completely<br>
controlled by the forces of the Chechen resistance.<br>
<p>
MOSCOW REACTS COOLLY TO CLINTON REMARKS ON NATO. U.S. president Bill<br>
Clinton's call this week for the NATO alliance to admit new members by 1999<br>
drew a measured response from Moscow yesterday. Russian foreign minister<br>
Yevgeny Primakov refused to comment at length on Clinton's October 22<br>
speech, saying only that Moscow continues to oppose enlargement and that the<br>
Kremlin would await further developments. (Interfax, October 23; see<br>
Monitor, October 23) Clinton had said that "no country outside of NATO will<br>
have a veto" on the admission of new members, a clear reference to Moscow. <br>
<p>
Reactions to Clinton's speech in Brussels were reported to have been<br>
positive, as NATO officials suggested that White House backing for<br>
enlargement would give the alliance's plans a boost. Poland's ambassador to<br>
NATO welcomed Clinton's target date of 1999 for new members and said that<br>
"U.S. leadership in NATO has been and will be an indispensable element of<br>
European security." Alliance leaders also lauded Clinton's reaffirmation<br>
that NATO's doors will remain open to additional new members after the first<br>
group of inductees-to-be is chosen. That policy, they hope, will ease the<br>
anxieties of those emerging democracies not chosen initially. (Reuter,<br>
October 23) NATO is scheduled to hold a meeting of foreign ministers in<br>
December at which potential new members will be evaluated and the timetable<br>
for expansion discussed. <br>
<p>
THE WORLD AS SEEN FROM THE KREMLIN. In a long article published by a Russian<br>
daily, Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov provides a glimpse of the Kremlin's<br>
official world view and sets out the contours of Russia's foreign and<br>
security policies. Primakov organizes his arguments in a conceptual<br>
framework based on the familiar notion that, in the post-Cold War era,<br>
international relations are in transition from a bi-polar to a multi-polar<br>
world. He would have us believe that his prescriptions are intended to<br>
facilitate that transition. Not surprisingly, Primakov depicts NATO<br>
enlargement as "a retreat back to blocs and coalitions" and an impediment to<br>
progress toward that multi-polar world and what he describes as "a<br>
democratic world order." The practice of those in the West to divide the<br>
world into post-Cold War winners and losers also impedes this transition,<br>
Primakov argues, because it promotes a counter-tendency toward the creation<br>
of a "uni-polar world" -- i.e., led by the U.S. -- that he says is rejected<br>
by a predominant part of the world community.<br>
<p>
As the foregoing suggests, Primakov employs his elaborate framework to<br>
introduce a familiar litany of Moscow's foreign policy goals and complaints.<br>
Among them are a call for renouncing the use of economic means to achieve<br>
geopolitical goals -- despite Moscow's own heavy-handed use of such means to<br>
force CIS integration -- which includes criticism of economic sanctions<br>
imposed on Libya and Iraq and objections to anti-dumping measures allegedly<br>
employed by the West against Russian exports. Primakov speaks of the world's<br>
progress in resolving regional conflicts, but equates the international<br>
peacekeeping efforts in the former Yugoslavia and the Middle East peace<br>
process with Moscow's own military interventions in such CIS hotspots as the<br>
Dniester region and Abkhazia. Primakov also grants the CIS equal standing<br>
with established international organizations like the OSCE, the Council of<br>
Europe, and NATO, and raises the issue of international human rights to<br>
criticize the Baltic countries for what he alleges is their mistreatment of<br>
Russian-speakers. (Nezavisimaya gazeta, October 22)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
AGREEMENT REACHED ON BLACK SEA FLEET. It was announced in Moscow today that<br>
presidents Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kuchma had reached full agreement during<br>
talks on the Black Sea Fleet, including on nettlesome basing and financial<br>
issues. Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will reportedly travel to<br>
Kiev next month to sign a final agreement on the division of the fleet.<br>
(BBC, October 24) Details of the agreement will be forthcoming.<br>
<p>
Russian deputy prime minister Valery Serov and naval commander in chief Adm.<br>
Feliks Gromov had conferred yesterday in Kiev with their Ukrainian<br>
counterparts to prepare for today's Moscow meeting of the two presidents.<br>
The Ukrainian president also met with the Russian delegation, and his<br>
Security Council secretary, Volodymyr Horbulin, insisted afterward that the<br>
sides were "closer than ever" to finalizing a package of three draft<br>
agreements. Yeltsin's foreign policy adviser Dmitry Ryurikov had disagreed,<br>
however, and the fine print of Horbulin's own remarks seemed to belie his<br>
optimism. Horbulin had indicated that, while the draft dealing with the<br>
Russian fleet's status on Ukrainian territory was "almost" ready for<br>
initialing, the draft on the terms for the fleet's partition required<br>
further negotiations, particularly on the apportionment of Sevastopol's<br>
bays. The third draft, on the lease of bases in Ukraine to Russia, "must<br>
absolutely stipulate a time frame for the lease" and the cost assessment<br>
methods, he said. (Interfax-Ukraine, UNIAN, October 23)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN DUMA ENACTS BLACK SEA FLEET BILL. Today's fleet agreement<br>
notwithstanding, the Russian Duma yesterday adopted by a vote of 334 to 1<br>
the bill on the Black Sea Fleet whose approval on first-reading last week<br>
caused an outcry in Ukraine. (see Monitor, October 17, 18, and 22) The bill<br>
prohibits any "unilateral" reduction of the fleet's forces and manpower and<br>
defines Sevastopol as the fleet's base. It also instructs the Russian<br>
government to ensure the base's military effectiveness, along with that of<br>
the fleet. It halts the fleet's partition with Ukraine, and bans any<br>
transfer of ships or coastal forces and facilities to Ukraine until "after<br>
the entry into force of treaties which would regulate the whole range of<br>
Russian-Ukrainian relations." (Itar-Tass, October 23)<br>
<p>
In effect, the bill treats the still-undivided bulk of the ex-Soviet fleet<br>
as a Russian possession and attempts to freeze this situation indefinitely<br>
by linking its resolution to a host of political issues. The bill also<br>
affords the Duma an opportunity to shape or torpedo that resolution through<br>
the ratification process. The bill now goes to the Federation Council. <br>
<p>
UKRAINIAN ADMIRALS RESIGN. Ukrainian navy commander Adm. Volodymyr<br>
Bezkorovaynyy and two of his top aides have turned in their resignations .<br>
They have been accepted by the defense minister and forwarded to President<br>
Leonid Kuchma for final approval. Two of the three cited health grounds in<br>
their applications, but sources in the Defense Ministry speculated that the<br>
resignations could be related to the ongoing discussions with Russia over<br>
the division of the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet. On October 9 an unnamed<br>
Ukrainian official had listed in detail what he described as dangerous<br>
concessions being made to Russia in the latest drafts of the agreements on<br>
the Black Sea Fleet. Another, or additional motive, might be the obvious<br>
unhappiness in the Defense Ministry with the way the navy is being run. One<br>
report said that the ministry plans to hold an "ad hoc" meeting in the navy<br>
headquarters later this month, and that it is assigning 15 officers from the<br>
ministry to naval headquarters. (Interfax-Ukraine, October 23)<br>
<p>
CORRECTION: A meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian Presidents is<br>
expected to take place in Moscow today, and not yesterday, as the Monitor<br>
mistakenly reported on October 23. <br>

THE GENERAL COULD RETURN, IF THE PRESIDENT LEAVES SOON<br>
By Nikolai Troitsky<br>
<p>
	Aleksandr Lebed's banishment from the Kremlin could be fatal, either for<br>
the general himself, or for those who were behind the order removing him.<br>
The general, of course, had no intention of being a bureaucrat for the rest<br>
of his life, but all the same, he did not suppose that the end would come so<br>
soon, and that he would be taken out of the game so quickly. He relied on<br>
his laurels as a peacemaker -- if not angels' wings, they still gave him a<br>
secure foothold in the higher reaches of government. And finally, he had<br>
remained loyal to the president, and was confident that the president would<br>
not let anyone harm him.<br>
	It is possible that Lebed's calculations would have been justified if<br>
Yeltsin had been able to work, and really controlled the situation. But the<br>
ailing president was much more guided and under the influence of his<br>
immediate entourage than the Security Council secretary had previously<br>
thought. Clearly, the fact that Yeltsin had only met with Lebed once during<br>
his recent illness, while he met with Anatoly Chubais and Viktor<br>
Chernomyrdin many times, did not help. Chubais could meet with Yeltsin<br>
whenever he wanted: the president now has no "doorkeeper," as he once had in<br>
Aleksandr Korzhakov, the commander of his bodyguard, or his chief assistant<br>
Viktor Ilyushin.<br>
	So the answer to the question "Who got Lebed fired?" is clear: Chubais and<br>
Chernomyrdin. Chubais was the initiator, and Chernomyrdin couldn't, or<br>
wouldn't, stand in his way. There is reliable information that it was the<br>
Kremlin's chief administrator who set Minister of Internal Affairs Anatoly<br>
Kulikov against Lebed, giving him his blessing to collect compromising<br>
information on the Security Council secretary. The fact that Kulikov, a<br>
fervent patriot and hawk, enthusiastically set about his task, since he<br>
considered both the peacemaking in Chechnya and Lebed's role in it to be<br>
harmful to Russia, is another matter entirely.<br>
	But there is another question: "Why did they fire Lebed?" Several official<br>
versions of the answer to this question have been advanced in the media<br>
outlets which live on the money of Chubais' allies and partners, - (the<br>
bankers Gusinsky and Berezovsky), - several influential newspapers and<br>
magazines, plus the most popular television channels, ORT (Channel 1) and NTV.<br>
<p>
First version: Lebed wanted to get kicked out<br>
	There is a certain amount of logic to this. Lebed broke all the rules of<br>
decency, violated bureaucratic etiquette, permitted himself to disagree<br>
publicly with the actions of several highly placed officials, etc. But why<br>
did he act this way? Out of his own stupidity, and his primitive nature?<br>
Hardly. Up to that time, the general had proved to be a rather shrewd<br>
politician.<br>
	It must not be forgotten that in the beginning of June, Yeltsin took Lebed<br>
onto his team, not as just another official, but as a political adviser, who<br>
had 11 million votes behind him. This was, so to speak, a coalition, and<br>
according to their preliminary agreements, Lebed received wide freedom of<br>
action. There was one limitation: he could not speak out against the<br>
president. And Lebed did not. True, he made a number of incautious<br>
statements in interviews with Western newspapers, but that was more due to<br>
his lack of experience than to any deliberate intention to do harm. But in<br>
any case, the general had not mastered "court etiquette."<br>
	Moreover, Lebed was constantly provoked: the head of the MVD accused him of<br>
ruining Russia and of having ties to the Chechen Mafia; the Minister of<br>
Defense decided to reorganize the Airborne Troops; even Chubais -- who is<br>
supposed to be a liberal -- accused the general of being insufficiently<br>
patriotic. Lebed is not the kind of man who can sit and take this without<br>
answering back. Yes, he gave in under provocation, he overreacted. But this<br>
provocation is a sign that others were pushing Lebed in this direction.<br>
<p>
Second version: Lebed was removed because he had destroyed the team's unity<br>
	But there has never been a unified team in the Kremlin! Yeltsin's favorite<br>
way of ruling the country is to set his subordinates against each other: so<br>
that none of them will get too strong and develop higher ambitions. Lebed's<br>
powerful figure could counterbalance Chubais and Chernomyrdin. This system<br>
of checks and balances could have kept the situation reasonably stable. This<br>
could have suited the president well, but could hardly be to the taste of<br>
either Chernomyrdin or Chubais. Exploiting the head of state's weakness,<br>
they removed the general from his counterbalancing position.<br>
	Finally, only a crazy man could have invited General Lebed in "to<br>
strengthen the team." They knew who they were getting. And thus, they are<br>
responsible for the consequences.<br>
<p>
Third version: Lebed was preparing for the president's death and was setting<br>
up his election campaign<br>
	This would be a serious moral reproach, but morality is foreign to<br>
politics. Everyone was preparing, and still is preparing, for the<br>
president's death -- Chernomyrdin, Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov, Communist<br>
leader Gennady Zyuganov, and even Chubais. They're all constantly setting up<br>
their election campaigns, putting together campaign staffs, and Chubais, who<br>
has no hope of becoming president himself, is carrying on negotiations with<br>
the aim of heading the presidential staff of one of the candidates.<br>
	But all this is going on unnoticed. Being experienced "courtiers," they are<br>
able to hide their intrigues. Lebed had no such possibility.<br>
Behind-the-scenes intrigues are not his forte. He tried to put his people in<br>
key positions, but was defeated: even the one man he managed to get<br>
appointed, Minister of Defense Igor Rodionov, turned his back on him. He had<br>
nothing left but to appeal to the masses of future voters over the heads of<br>
his direct superiors.<br>
	People say that the Security Council secretary should not be a public<br>
politician. Possibly. But then again, they should have appointed a different<br>
person to the job from the very outset. If they took Lebed, only to fire him<br>
later -- then what's the point of blaming him?<br>
<p>
Fourth and final version: General Lebed was fired because he got close to<br>
the president's former bodyguard, General Korzhakov<br>
	The president himself emphasized this in his televised speech on the<br>
reasons for Lebed's dismissal: I fired Korzhakov, and Lebed made him his<br>
successor as deputy from the Tula electoral district.<br>
	This is a strange conclusion. What, is Korzhakov the president's enemy? Is<br>
he now an "outcast" after serving him faithfully for so many years? There<br>
are even rumors circulating that Korzhakov has gotten close to the<br>
Communists. But that is completely absurd! Both Korzhakov and Lebed himself<br>
are absolutely unacceptable figures for the leftist opposition. It is not<br>
for nothing that all the opposition figures approved the general's<br>
dismissal: a dangerous competitor in the struggle for power had been removed<br>
from the political arena. And by the way, the Communist Party is very close<br>
to another high-ranking official -- Lebed's arch-enemy, Interior Minister<br>
Kulikov. But for some reason, they didn't fire him...<br>
	Nevertheless, it was Lebed's alliance with Korzhakov which served as the<br>
catalyst in the Security Council secretary's removal. There were many<br>
reasons for this.<br>
	When Korzhakov spoke of compromising information on top government<br>
officials, he wasn't bluffing. There is such information, but Korzhakov does<br>
not have it himself. It is in the safes of the Federal Security Service<br>
[FSB]. I know for a fact that there are documents there which implicate<br>
Chubais in illegal financial machinations during the privatization period,<br>
in which his present banker friends Gusinsky, Berezovsky, and Vladimir<br>
Potanin, who has since become first vice-premier, figure prominently. I saw<br>
several of these documents with my own eyes, but FSB officials categorically<br>
refused to release them to the press, fearing for their own lives.<br>
	And so, an alliance was formed which was very dangerous for Chubais and his<br>
friends: Lebed-Korzhakov-the FSB. It had to be destroyed, no matter what. So<br>
Chubais showed the president an interview with Korzhakov's former deputy,<br>
Colonel Streletsky, in which the latter spoke of Yeltsin's daughter, Tatyana<br>
Dyachenko, in an offensive tone (incidentally, she is closely linked with<br>
Chubais' group, and with her help, the Kremlin administration is able to<br>
push Yeltsin into making the decisions they need). The president never<br>
forgives insults to his family, and in his own mind, forged the chain:<br>
Streletsky-Korzhakov-Lebed. Lebed's fate was decided then and there.<br>
	In spite of this, it must be admitted that making an open, public alliance<br>
with Korzhakov was one of General Lebed's main mistakes. The figure of the<br>
former chief bodyguard gives rise to too many negative associations in the<br>
public mind.<br>
	But Lebed is speaking the truth when he says that he was removed by<br>
Chubais, because he was an obstacle to the latter's ruling the country<br>
instead of Yeltsin. Of course, Lebed himself wanted to rule the country in<br>
that way, but didn't succeed, but that's another matter.<br>
	What next? General Lebed has very good chances for victory in the<br>
presidential elections, if they take place, at a minimum, in the next six<br>
months. He is accumulating all of the dissatisfaction with official policy,<br>
and is becoming an opposition leader who cannot be accused of "pulling the<br>
country back." Consequently, as cynical as this sounds, the worse the<br>
president's health gets, the better it is for the general.<br>
	If Yeltsin hangs on for a year or two, then General Lebed will lose all his<br>
political capital, and will suffer the fate of another once-popular general,<br>
former vice president Aleksandr Rutskoi. Lebed, deprived of a government<br>
position, cannot hold the public's attention that long. He has no<br>
organizational structure, and, most likely, cannot create one. People will<br>
simply forget him. And then, his predictions of a "hot autumn" in 1996 will<br>
remain just an empty phrase.<br>
	So everything depends on the condition of the president's health. Reports<br>
on this are quite contradictory. But it must not be all that bad, if he was<br>
smart enough to think of creating a "collective regency" on October 21. No,<br>
not the kind which Lebed and Korzhakov are talking about, but a sort of<br>
supreme Consultative Council, made up of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin,<br>
Chubais, and the Speakers of both houses of parliament, Gennady Seleznev and<br>
Yegor Stroyev.<br>
	From all indications, in the near future, it will be these four who will<br>
rule the country. Chubais and Chernomyrdin will counterbalance each other,<br>
and the speakers will try to restrain their ambitions. Thus, Yeltsin has<br>
re-established his system of checks and balances. But there is no longer any<br>
room in it for General Lebed.<br>

LEBED AND THE BUREAUCRATS' UNWRITTEN CODE<br>
By Gleb Cherkassov<br>
<p>
	Russian Security Council secretary Aleksandr Lebed managed to hang on in<br>
his post a little less than four months. The man who took third place in the<br>
presidential elections, and, by joining Boris Yeltsin's team, helped him to<br>
win a decisive victory in the second round over Gennady Zyuganov, was fired<br>
by the president personally. Yeltsin appeared on the television screen from<br>
his sanatorium, made a short, but emotional, speech, and signed an order<br>
removing him. The president's actions were supported by a mass propaganda<br>
campaign; for two days running the television channels accused Lebed of<br>
every mortal sin.<br>
	People began predicting that Lebed would not hold on in the Kremlin the day<br>
after he was appointed. The opposition leaders who understood that after<br>
Lebed joined Yeltsin's team, Zyuganov's chances would go down the drain,<br>
were the most zealous in their predictions.<br>
	Lebed never hid the fact that he had presidential ambitions. And Boris<br>
Yeltsin, in an indirect way, did not rule out Lebed's becoming his<br>
successor. From all indications, Russia's first president may really have<br>
been thinking about making Lebed the second president. But the people<br>
surrounding Yeltsin, above all, Viktor Chernomyrdin, who thought that the<br>
job should be his could not agree with this. <br>
	Chernomyrdin, however, did not discuss his feelings. He strictly observed<br>
the bureaucrat's unwritten code, which states that one must never disclose<br>
his true intentions and must avoid making enemies.<br>
	From that point of view, Lebed behaved very badly indeed. He was incautious<br>
in his statements, and even more so, in his actions. While he was Security<br>
Council secretary, he did not make a single friend in the government<br>
structures. He allowed himself to speak openly about his presidential<br>
ambitions and discussed the president's illness. The friendship which<br>
unexpectedly arose between Lebed and Aleksandr Korzhakov, the former head of<br>
the Presidential Security Service turned all of the president's entourage,<br>
and above all, Boris Yeltsin's family, against him. And nobody in the<br>
government wanted anything to do with Lebed after he appointed Sergei<br>
Glazyev, the ex-chairman of the State Duma's Economic Policy Committee and<br>
former minister of foreign economic relations, who in recent years had<br>
quarreled with virtually every government official, as his economic advisor.<br>
Lebed lost the support of the army's top generals after he spoke out<br>
publicly in defense of the airborne troops -- paratroopers are not<br>
well-liked in the army. After making peace in Chechnya, he made enemies of<br>
all of the hard-liners, and handing the republic over to the separatists, he<br>
deprived all those who had invested money in the reconstruction of Chechnya<br>
of the possibility of earning it back.<br>
	In other words, Lebed involuntarily enabled the government elite to close<br>
ranks against him. Viktor Chernomyrdin, presidential chief of administration<br>
Anatoly Chubais, Minister of Internal Affairs Anatoly Kulikov, and Minister<br>
of Defense Igor Rodionov all united in the fight against him.<br>
	The Security Council secretary had no chance against the government<br>
machine, but in all probability, he didn't want to stay on in his position,<br>
anyway.<br>
	Strictly speaking, all of his actions, which looked like mistakes from the<br>
bureaucrat's point of view, were extremely successful from the point of view<br>
of electoral politics. Lebed's frankness attracted the voters, who were sick<br>
of the evasive double-talk which is characteristic of the overwhelming<br>
majority of Russian politicians. His alliance with Aleksandr Korzhakov gave<br>
him compromising information on top officials, money, and an analytical<br>
team. Defending the airborne troops brought Lebed the eternal sympathy, not<br>
only of veterans of the airborne troops, but also among those who wish to<br>
see the Russian army become a mighty force, able to fight anyone --<br>
paratroopers are considered the army's elite. His protection of Glazyev<br>
brought Lebed support from those who do not agree with the government's<br>
present economic course, and moreover, he showed that he stands behind those<br>
who are loyal to him. And finally, the peace in Chechnya brought him<br>
unexpected dividends in the form of the support of all consistent opponents<br>
of the war in the Northern Caucasus. <br>
	Lebed's removal has closed a number of questions, and has opened others.<br>
The peace process in the Northern Caucasus, which was Aleksandr Lebed's most<br>
weighty achievement while he was in government service, will become the<br>
biggest problem.<br>
	No one really knows what to do next with Chechnya. The peace process, in<br>
large part, was built on Lebed's personal authority, and the separatist<br>
leaders are inclined to negotiate only with him. If hostilities resume, the<br>
people who removed Aleksandr Lebed will be blamed, both in Russia and in<br>
Chechnya. Moreover, the separatists' hands are tied: the man who signed<br>
virtually all the agreements is no longer a government official. Of course,<br>
they can demand that a top government official confirm that the documents<br>
which Lebed signed are still in force. Thus, the politicians remaining in<br>
the Kremlin must either continue the peace process begun by Aleksandr Lebed,<br>
thereby absolving him of betraying Russia's national interests, or make a<br>
step towards escalating military actions.<br>
	The search for a successor to Boris Yeltsin is no less of a problem. Viktor<br>
Chernomyrdin considers himself to be the "party of power's" main candidate<br>
in the next presidential elections, although far from everyone agrees with<br>
him. Many remember that the prime minister lost the parliamentary elections,<br>
and therefore have no hope that Chernomyrdin will succeed in winning the<br>
much more complicated presidential campaign. Some top officials may be<br>
looking at Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov, but it wouldn't be easy for him to win<br>
a nationwide election either. <br>
	It cannot be ruled out that, with the elections approaching, people in the<br>
Kremlin will take another look at supporting Aleksandr Lebed, but if so,<br>
they would have to make an agreement under completely different terms. The<br>
"enfant terrible," who broke all the written and unwritten rules of the<br>
political game, has left the Kremlin, and a political leader has appeared on<br>
the horizon who can gather all the non-Communists and non-democrats around<br>
him -- i.e., a majority of Russian voters.<br>
	Now, a great deal depends on when the elections are held -- from all<br>
estimates, if the elections are held in the next two years, Aleksandr Lebed<br>
will be the next president. It cannot be ruled out that he will come to that<br>
post as governor of Tula, where he has been nominated as a candidate.<br>

THE "PRIMAKOV DOCTRINE" <br>
By Rossen Vassilev<br>
<p>
	In the standoff between Washington and Baghdad, Moscow has expressed<br>
sympathy with Iraq. Despite its strident condemnation of American actions in<br>
the region, however, the Kremlin has at the same time tried not to alienate<br>
Washington. Instead, Russia is making the best of its weakened and unstable<br>
condition by engaging in some innovative diplomacy aimed at reclaiming lost<br>
ground in the Arab world.<br>
	Russian reaction to the U.S. bombing of Iraqi air defenses in early<br>
September was uniformly negative. The Russian TV channels primarily aired<br>
Baghdad's view of the events. In an interview with the newspaper Vechernaya<br>
Moskva, Security Council chief Aleksandr Lebed compared the Clinton<br>
administration to "a bull in a china shop," accusing it of acting "beyond<br>
belief, beyond logic" in bombing Iraq. Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor<br>
Possuvalyuk warned Washington that it must respect Iraq's sovereignty and<br>
territorial integrity. (1)<br>
	In Baghdad, the Russian charge d'affaires Vladimir Titorenko told Reuters<br>
that Russia does not authorize any form of military intervention on behalf<br>
of Iraq's persecuted minorities. He also suggested that Baghdad had every<br>
right to defend its airspace from intruding American warplanes. At the 96th<br>
Inter-Parliamentary Conference held in Beijing, Gennady Seleznev, the<br>
Communist chairman of the Russian State Duma, denounced the U.S. missile<br>
attacks on Iraq, as well as the use of economic sanctions and embargoes<br>
which, he said, violated the principles of international law and infringed<br>
upon Baghdad's sovereignty.<br>
	At a protest rally near the U.S. embassy in Moscow, at which an American<br>
flag was burned, LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky accused Washington of<br>
preparing to start World War III and compared  compared Bill Clinton to<br>
Hitler. (2)<br>
	At the UN, Russia was outspokenly critical of the U.S. and torpedoed a<br>
British-drafted resolution in the Security Council intended to win backing<br>
for the American action. Russian diplomats also charged that the cruise<br>
missile and aircraft overflights were a violation of the demilitarized zone<br>
(DMZ) that was set up between Iraq and Kuwait after the Persian Gulf war.<br>
The Russian delegation to the 51st regular session of the UN General<br>
Assembly castigated Washington for failing to seek support in the Security<br>
Council before undertaking military operations against Iraq. In his first<br>
speech to  the UN General Assembly as Russian foreign minister, Yevgeny<br>
Primakov warned that American attempts to "impose unilateral decisions would<br>
provoke a chaotic and unpredictable drift in international relations."<br>
	In contrast, the Russian media played down Saddam Hussein's intervention in<br>
Kurdish infighting in northern Iraq -- which led the White House to order<br>
missile attacks on Baghdad's military installations in the first place -- as<br>
a legitimate defense of Iraq's territorial integrity. Some Russian officials<br>
even praised the "current restraint," "patience," and "reason" shown by the<br>
Iraqi leadership and its "sensible" readiness to seek political solutions to<br>
the problems of the region. (3)<br>
	Together with France and China, Russia has championed the lifting of UN<br>
sanctions against Baghdad -- presumably in order to tap Iraq's potential as<br>
a market for its exports. In his UN General Assembly address, Primakov said,<br>
"We are convinced that the UN should take such measures only in exceptional<br>
cases after all other means have been fully exhausted." Washington has been<br>
insisting that the UN keep Iraq under a tight economic embargo and until<br>
recently the Russian government was supportive of the U.S. position.<br>
	Yet, Moscow did not take a hard anti-American stance during the Iraqi<br>
crisis. Even though he was critical of American policies in the region,<br>
Primakov avoided a direct confrontation with the U.S. over Iraq. Instead, he<br>
lived up to his reputation as "Saddam's buddy" by persuading Iraq not to<br>
create any new pretexts for the further escalation of tensions in the<br>
Persian Gulf. Throughout the crisis, the Russians remained in contact with<br>
the American ambassador in Moscow, Thomas Pickering. The Kremlin sent out<br>
clear signals to Washington that Russia's diplomatic efforts were not aimed<br>
against American interests. (4) The Russian Foreign Ministry even distanced<br>
itself from the pro-Iraqi remarks attributed to its Baghdad envoy. (5)<br>
	This deft diplomatic manoeuvreing shows that an old Middle East hand is at<br>
the helm of Russia's foreign relations. Unlike his immediate predecessor,<br>
Andrei Kozyrev, who placed a top priority on maintaining cordial relations<br>
with the West, especially the U.S. -- often to the neglect of relations with<br>
the Third World -- Primakov seems to be eager to restore old ties with<br>
former friends and clients abroad. A major goal of his foreign policy is to<br>
regain for Russia the political and economic clout that the Soviet Union<br>
once enjoyed in the Arab world.<br>
	In what some have called the "Primakov Doctrine," Moscow is pursuing a<br>
low-cost and relatively risk-free strategy of stepping into regional<br>
disputes as peacemaker and bolstering its influence through successful<br>
mediation and conciliation, often at the expense of a "bellicose" U.S. The<br>
new foreign policy direction -- endorsed at a recent gathering of<br>
ambassadors from the CIS countries -- faced its first test during the latest<br>
Persian Gulf imbroglio. At first, Moscow vehemently condemned the cruise<br>
missile strikes at Iraq as evidence of Washington's ambition to dominate the<br>
world in the post-Cold War era. But Primakov soon toned down the official<br>
rhetoric and moved into the diplomatic vacuum to mediate on behalf of his<br>
old friend, President Saddam Hussein. In short order, the foreign ministers<br>
of Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, and other concerned countries began flocking to<br>
Moscow to seek Russian assistance in finding a way out of the crisis. On<br>
Russian TV, Primakov took credit for Baghdad's pledge not to fire on U.S.<br>
aircraft patrolling the expanded "no-fly" zones over Iraq -- a claim<br>
confirmed by Iraqi officials. He boasted that Russian diplomatic<br>
intervention was behind Baghdad's self-restraint, which averted another U.S.<br>
air strike on Iraq.<br>
	The benefits from the new, pro-Iraqi diplomacy go far beyond claiming<br>
credit for preventing another clash between Baghdad and Washington. Primakov<br>
is a longtime advocate of close ties between Moscow and Baghdad. He is<br>
pushing for a revival of the oil-for-food and medicine deal negotiated<br>
earlier between the UN and Iraq, which has been suspended under pressure<br>
from Washington. In the face of American resistance, he is trying to hammer<br>
out an international consensus to have all sanctions against Baghdad lifted.<br>
If he is successful in this endeavor, Russian business interests will be<br>
able to return to Iraq for lucrative trade deals and huge oil contracts.<br>
	The diplomatic windfall from the new strategy could be even more<br>
attractive. By defending Iraq against American "aggression" and "hegemony,"<br>
Primakov is enhancing his own reputation in the Middle East as a trusted<br>
friend of the Arabs. He is well aware that his pro-Baghdad stand is bound to<br>
win him sympathy throughout the Arab world, where there is a growing<br>
opposition to sanctions on humanitarian grounds. And he also knows that Arab<br>
sympathy will help him rebuild the many old connections in the Middle East<br>
that were abandoned after the collapse of the Soviet Union.<br>
	With many Arab countries suspiciously eyeing the new, hardline Israeli<br>
government and its reluctant embrace of the stalled peace process, Primakov<br>
realizes that the time is right for Moscow to re-enter the Middle East<br>
geopolitical game and exploit the strategic advantages accruing from its<br>
tilt toward the Arabs. And he shrewdly senses that such a move would likely<br>
be at the expense of Russia's erstwhile Cold War adversary, the U.S., which<br>
continues to be seen by Arab nationalists and Islamic fundamentalists alike<br>
as Israel's sole arms-supplier and mentor.<br>

NEWS:<br>
<p>
RUSSIA HAS NO TERRITORIAL CLAIMS ON UKRAINE, MINISTER SAYS. Russia has no<br>
territorial claims on Ukraine, recognizes Ukraine's sovereignty and<br>
territorial integrity, and wishes to resolve the problem of the basing of<br>
the Black Sea Fleet, First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Igor Ivanov<br>
told Interfax yesterday. He was reacting to an assertion earlier in the week<br>
by Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov that the Crimean port of Sevastopol is Russian<br>
territory. Ivanov said the question of the Black Sea Fleet will be on the<br>
agenda today when the Ukrainian and Russian presidents are expected to meet<br>
near Moscow. (Interfax, October 22)<br>
<p>
PRO-RUSSIAN FACTIONS STRONGLY REPRESENTED IN CRIMEAN LEADERSHIP. The Crimean<br>
Supreme Soviet has elected a new presidium. Crimea's political system is<br>
dominated by parliament so membership in the 16-member presidium is hotly<br>
contested. Eleven of the new members represent pro-Russian parliamentary<br>
groups. Only three are from groups that unambiguously support Ukrainian<br>
sovereignty over the peninsula. The Crimean Tatar "Kurultai" faction was so<br>
angry at being offered only two seats that it refused to take part in<br>
voting, although Crimean Tatar leader Refat Chubarov was elected one of<br>
three deputy speakers. (Nezavisimaya gazeta, October 22) The strongly<br>
pro-Russian coloration of the new presidium may lead to tension with the<br>
central Ukrainian government.<br>
<p>
RODIONOV: GENERAL STAFF SHOULD CONTROL ALL MILITARY UNITS. Like his<br>
predecessor, Russian defense minister Igor Rodionov has said that the<br>
General Staff should control all the military forces in the country, not<br>
just those belonging to the Ministry of Defense. Otherwise, he saw no way<br>
out of "the current unhealthy situation, when alongside the armed forces of<br>
the country other troops are actively developing and nobody can say in which<br>
direction..." (Itar-Tass, October 22) In Russia, non-Defense Ministry troops<br>
are now estimated to exceed those in the regular army. <br>
<p>
RUSSIAN NAVY'S SUPPORT SHIPS IN SAD SHAPE. The Navy's deputy chief of<br>
logistic support, Adm. Ivan Vasilyev, said yesterday that the 1,000 vessels<br>
in the service's logistic fleet would require some 1.4 trillion rubles to<br>
repair. More than 600 of them needed to be put in dry docks for major work.<br>
The logistic fleet is made up of fuel tankers, cargo ships, repair ships,<br>
ammunition ships, and the like. Vasilyev called it "the backbone of the<br>
entire logistic support system in the Navy." (Interfax, October 22) <br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES TURN TO NATO ENLARGEMENT. "Today, I want to<br>
state America's goal: By 1999 -- NATO's 50th anniversary and ten years after<br>
the fall of the Berlin Wall -- the first group of countries we invite to<br>
join should be full-fledged members of NATO," U.S. president Bill Clinton<br>
told an audience in Detroit yesterday. Clinton warned against allowing a "a<br>
gray zone of insecurity" to re-emerge in Europe, and said that the West must<br>
not "allow the Iron Curtain to be replaced by a veil of indifference." But<br>
the U.S. president also held out an olive branch to Moscow, urging those in<br>
Russia who "still look at NATO through a Cold War prism" to reconsider their<br>
views. "NATO will promote greater stability in Europe," Clinton said, "and<br>
Russia will be among the beneficiaries." Clinton restated an American<br>
proposal for conclusion of a formal agreement between Russia and NATO. <br>
<p>
In his own remarks, Republican challenger Bob Dole tried to put some<br>
distance between himself and Clinton on the enlargement issue. Dole called<br>
for the alliance to take in additional members a year earlier, in 1998, and<br>
criticized the president for "dragging his feet since 1993" on enlargement.<br>
He also assumed a more assertive posture toward Moscow, urging that the<br>
"cries of extreme Russian nationalists" not be allowed to deflect NATO from<br>
its enlargement plans. Dole added that the "framework of peace must include<br>
assurances to the Baltic states and Ukraine," particularly given "the<br>
ongoing instability in Russia." Both men were campaigning in Michigan and,<br>
with the election only two weeks away, were clearly aiming for support from<br>
Midwestern voters with ties to Eastern Europe. (Western agencies, October<br>
22) To date the presidential campaign has been notably short of discussion<br>
on foreign policy issues. <br>
<p>
COULD THE WRONG FINGERS GET ON RUSSIA'S STRATEGIC NUCLEAR TRIGGERS? The U.S.<br>
Central Intelligence Agency has apparently concluded that they already are.<br>
It is also concerned that there are serious problems with the command and<br>
control of Russian nuclear weapons and that an unauthorized launch of a<br>
strategic nuclear missile is not impossible. This alarming finding is<br>
contained in a top-secret study -- published last month and entitled<br>
"Prospects for Unsanctioned Use of Russian Nuclear Weapons" -- obtained by<br>
the Washington Times. According to the newspaper, the study found that<br>
Strategic Rocket Force (SRF) units, as well as strategic submarine<br>
commanders, have the technical ability to launch their missiles without<br>
authorization from higher military or political authorities. The study<br>
reportedly warned of conspiracies within nuclear-armed units to commit<br>
nuclear blackmail as the Russian military is pummeled by housing shortages,<br>
loss of benefits, and withheld pay. Indicating Russian concerns about<br>
unauthorized missile firings, the report says that the SRF has even<br>
established a new procedure for units to report improper missile launches.<br>
(Washington Times, October 22)<br>
<p>
While President Clinton and other administration officials have made much of<br>
the fact that Russian missiles are no longer aimed at American targets, a<br>
former U.S. missile launch officer recently revealed that these changes were<br>
merely symbolic. Writing in the Washington Post earlier this month, Bruce<br>
Blair said that the computer banks in the Russian missiles still retain<br>
their former American targets and they could be retargeted from their<br>
present "zero flight plan" in 10 seconds. U.S. missiles, he said, could be<br>
retargeted for Russian destinations just as quickly. (Washington Post,<br>
October 15)<br>
<p>
While not denying the accuracy of the leaked report, Clinton Administration<br>
officials are downplaying the revelations. Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said<br>
the U.S. believed that the Russians have "taken prudent steps to keep the<br>
[nuclear] forces safe and secure." However, the report will provide more<br>
ammunition to those supporting a national anti-ballistic missile system, the<br>
very thing the Russians say will restart a nuclear arms race. (Voice of<br>
America, October 22)<br>
<p>
LEBED EXPECTED TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR OF TULA OBLAST. Ousted Russian security<br>
chief Aleksandr Lebed is expected to run for the governorship of Tula oblast<br>
when the post comes up for election in December. (Izvestiya, October 22)<br>
This would give Lebed, like the newly elected governor of Kursk oblast,<br>
Aleksandr Rutskoi, a seat in the upper house of the Russian parliament and a<br>
useful springboard for a new political career. Lebed is hugely popular in<br>
Tula, where he commanded the elite Tula paratrooper division in 1985-89 and<br>
where he was elected to parliament in December 1995. He was mobbed by crowds<br>
shouting "Lebed our president!" during a recent visit to the region. The<br>
incumbent governor, Yeltsin-appointee Nikolai Sevryugin, is highly unpopular. <br>
<p>
Lebed has already been invited to run for governor, but the Russian media<br>
are making much of the fact that the man behind the invitation is one<br>
Nikolai Matveev. He is the leader of a movement called Civil Solidarity,<br>
which claims to have 1,500 members in the region. Doubts about the bona<br>
fides of this movement arose when journalists discovered that the<br>
57-year-old Matveev is also the person who published, under another name, an<br>
open letter in a Tula youth newspaper on behalf of a non-existent youth<br>
movement. The letter proposed Aleksandr Korzhakov as candidate for Lebed's<br>
vacated Duma seat. (Itar-Tass, October 17; Kommersant-daily, October 15 and<br>
19; NTV, October 21; Moskovsky komsomolets, October 22) The fun that the<br>
press has been having with this story underlines the difficulties Lebed will<br>
face both in building a support base and in winning over the media, which is<br>
loyal to President Boris Yeltsin.<br>
<p>
CHECHENS TRY TO ESTABLISH OIL PRODUCTION MONOPOLY. Chechnya's new coalition<br>
government met yesterday for the second time and discussed the oil industry.<br>
The Chechens plan in mid-November to resume refining oil and to begin<br>
producing gasoline. By the end of November they hope to be supplying the<br>
republic with its own petroleum products. Armed guards have already taken<br>
control of all the oil refineries and the main routes for transporting<br>
petroleum. By a decree of Zelimkhan Yandarbiev, it is now illegal to produce<br>
gasoline privately. A special branch of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of<br>
Chechnya-Ichkeria has been tasked with keeping track of oil refining and the<br>
sale of petroleum products. (RTR, October 22)<br>
<p>
When Grozny and a large part of the republic were under the control of<br>
federal troops, the illegal trade in petroleum products was widespread.<br>
Homemade gasoline was sold on the street and powered most of the civilian<br>
automobiles in Chechnya. Zia Bazhaev, president of YUNKO (Southern Oil<br>
Company), which had a government monopoly on the extraction and refining of<br>
Chechen oil during this period, told the Monitor that about 30 percent of<br>
Chechen oil was being illegally extracted by criminal groups. These bootleg<br>
oil companies had their own workers and equipment. Sometimes, entire<br>
refineries would spring up next to oil pipelines, to refine oil that had<br>
been illegally siphoned off. Some of these operations, Bazhaev maintains,<br>
were under the control of opposition groups, allowing them to supply their<br>
army with gasoline even before they took Grozny in August.<br>
<p>
Chechnya's new coalition government now intends to do what the federal<br>
forces failed to do: monopolize the production of petroleum products. But<br>
this policy may run into resistance from radical Chechen field commanders.<br>
Shamil Basaev told the Monitor in August that, once final victory was<br>
achieved, he would destroy the republic's oil complex so that neither Russia<br>
nor any other country would ever be tempted to attack Chechnya again.<br>
<p>
CIS AFFAIRS<br>
<p>
MOSCOW BLASTS U.S. CONGRESSIONAL RESOLUTIONS. Russian Foreign Ministry<br>
spokesman Gennady Tarasov yesterday lambasted recent U.S. congressional<br>
resolutions on promoting stability in the Baltic region, supporting<br>
Ukraine's independence, and calling for the withdrawal of Russian troops<br>
from Moldova. Tarasov described the three resolutions as "prejudiced and<br>
unfriendly toward Russia," and condemned "congressional circles which seek<br>
to revive the myth about Russian hegemonism, ...feeling entitled to pass<br>
judgment on the situation in countries of the former USSR and even to<br>
recommend how they should manage their relations with each other. We do not<br>
accept any interference in our relations with neighboring countries."<br>
Tarasov also said that "to play a constructive role in U.S.-Russian<br>
relations, Congress should revise its attitude toward CIS integration."<br>
(Itar-Tass, Interfax, October 22)<br>
<p>
A textbook reaffirmation of Moscow's sphere-of-influence concept for Eastern<br>
Europe, Tarasov's statement recalls post-World War II pronouncements that<br>
similarly ruled out any "outside interference" in the then-USSR's relations<br>
with countries in the region. Tarasov's statement also echoes Foreign<br>
Minister Yevgeny Primakov's and other Russian officials' recent claims that<br>
U.S. and, generally, Western attitudes toward Russian-led "integration" of<br>
the CIS are an important factor in determining whether Russia's relations<br>
with the West will be friendly or not.<br>
<p>
CIS PRIME MINISTERS' MEETING UNPRODUCTIVE. Prime ministers of CIS member<br>
countries failed to reach any significant common decision at their regular<br>
autumn meeting, held last week in Moscow. The one potential exception was an<br>
agreement to establish the "Granit" corporation, meant to produce equipment<br>
for a joint CIS air defense system. Most of the eight participating<br>
countries regard that agreement primarily as a business proposition. Ukraine<br>
signed only 11 documents, which it deemed compatible with its independence,<br>
out of some 27 proposed by Russia. Turkmenistan declined to sign any of<br>
them, citing its own neutral status. Most delegations picked and chose only<br>
what they thought advantageous to themselves.<br>
<p>
Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told the meeting and the ensuing<br>
news conference that he is "dissatisfied with the tempo of integration." He<br>
regretted the "exceedingly slow" formation of CIS transnational corporations<br>
and the failure thus far to establish supranational management of the<br>
Russia-Belarus-Kazakhstan-Kyrgyzstan customs union. He also criticized the<br>
growing "duplication" of production capacities of CIS countries as an<br>
"impermissible luxury," and, with a view to unifying member countries'<br>
economic legislation and transport networks, called for real executive<br>
powers to be given to the Interstate Economic Committee. Chernomyrdin<br>
insisted that it was "high time to work out a vertical management mechanism<br>
of integration processes." (Interfax, Itar-Tass, October 18 through 20)<br>
These are perennial issues which Moscow raises, generally in vain, at<br>
high-level CIS meetings. The uncertainties surrounding the political<br>
situation in Moscow would seem to presage a continuing lack of progress on<br>
the Russian government's version of integration, which seeks mainly to<br>
establish supranational bodies under its own control. <br>
<p>
THE BALTIC STATES<br>
<p>
ESTONIAN GOVERNMENT ENDORSES MINORITIES' CONVENTION. The Estonian government<br>
yesterday endorsed the European Convention on the Rights of Ethnic<br>
Minorities and is forwarding it to parliament for ratification, Prime<br>
Minister Tiit Vahi announced. Vahi recommended that parliament attach a<br>
declaration defining the notion of ethnic minority. He pointed out that<br>
Estonia's cultural autonomy law recognizes ethnic minorities as constituted<br>
by citizens interested in cultivating their ethnic identity. (BNS, October<br>
22) Many Russians in Estonia and their supporters in Russia object to the<br>
linkage of ethnic minority status to citizenship. That linkage, however, is<br>
the norm in European countries. <br>
<p>
In a coincidental development, Russian Duma deputy and Economic Freedom<br>
party leader Konstantin Borovoy stated on returning from Estonia that its<br>
stateless Russian residents ought at last to opt for either Estonian or<br>
Russian citizenship, and on that basis choose their country of residence.<br>
The large number of Russians not applying for either citizenship "have<br>
remained Soviet citizens and vote Communist ," Borovoy observed. (BNS,<br>
October 22) The Russian government takes the opposite position, calling for<br>
mass-naturalization of Soviet-era Russian settlers. It accuses Estonia and<br>
Latvia of ethnic discrimination and predicts an exodus from the Baltic<br>
states. Moscow's view overlooks the fact that those Russians have generally<br>
opted to stay on as legal residents in the more prosperous and better<br>
ordered Baltic states, rather than exercise their right to take Russian<br>
citizenship and repatriate.<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
U.S., WORLD BANK AID COMMITMENTS TO UKRAINE FIRMING UP. On a visit to Kiev,<br>
U.S. senators Richard Lugar and Sam Nunn assured Ukrainian president Leonid<br>
Kuchma yesterday that the Nunn-Lugar program of financial assistance to<br>
Ukraine will continue for at least two to three years. The program, worth<br>
$390 million, is designed to offset the costs of Ukraine's nuclear<br>
disarmament and also to finance technical assistance to Ukraine. Lugar and<br>
Nunn described the country's nuclear disarmament program and the tempo of<br>
its execution as "exemplary." (Interfax-Ukraine, October 22)<br>
<p>
Also yesterday, the World Bank's Kiev office announced that the Bank's Board<br>
of Directors has approved a $317 million credit for upgrading 14<br>
power-generating plants in Ukraine. This credit forms part of a<br>
three-pronged program envisaging more than $900 million in World Bank<br>
credits to Ukraine in 1996-1998. The other two parts of the program concern<br>
the reform of Ukraine's coal mining and agricultural sectors.<br>
(Interfax-Ukraine, October 22)<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
RUSSIA STANDS BY ITS ARMENIAN ALLY IN ELECTION CONTROVERSY. The Armenian<br>
government informed its public yesterday that Russia had deflected OSCE<br>
criticism of the government's conduct of the recent presidential election.<br>
At a meeting of the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna, called to discuss that<br>
election, the Russian delegation urged that the Armenian Central Election<br>
Commission's viewpoint be given greater weight. It also advised the OSCE's<br>
Office of Human Rights and Democratic Institutions against criticism that<br>
could exert a "negative impact" on the internal situation in post-Soviet<br>
states. (Armenpress, October 21)<br>
<p>
Russia, which cooperates militarily with the Armenian government, openly<br>
supported President Levon Ter-Petrosian's reelection. Boris Yeltsin and<br>
Viktor Chernomyrdin issued televised, election-eve endorsements while the<br>
military conducted highly publicized joint Russian-Armenian exercises near<br>
the Turkish border, capped by an election-eve parade in Yerevan. Russian<br>
election observers were the only ones to pronounce the balloting correct.<br>
The government-controlled Central Election Commission had presided over the<br>
election fraud, and last week expelled from its ranks one of its few members<br>
from the opposition coalition.<br>
<p>
In Yerevan yesterday, all five parliamentary deputies of the National<br>
Democratic Union, including the opposition coalition's presidential<br>
candidate, Vazgen Manukian, declared a boycott of the parliament because of<br>
the ruling party's "unethical behavior" toward them. (Interfax, October 22)<br>
NDU deputies were among the eight opposition parliamentarians deprived of<br>
their immunity, beaten up, and expelled from the chamber by majority MPs,<br>
who thereby reduced the non-Communist opposition's parliamentary<br>
representation to almost nothing.<br>

NEWS:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN MILITARY PRESENCE IN MOLDOVA TO BE LEGALIZED BY DUMA. Russia's Duma<br>
is about to consider a bill, submitted by deputies of the Narodovlastie and<br>
Zhirinovsky factions, that would confer on the Russian Operational Group of<br>
Forces in Moldova (the former 14th Army) an official status as forces<br>
permanently stationed abroad. The bill states that the region is one of<br>
"Russian strategic interests." Transdniester leader Igor Smirnov attended<br>
the committee meeting which finalized the bill. Russian prime minister<br>
Viktor Chernomyrdin broke precedent by officially acknowledging that he<br>
received Smirnov yesterday. (Interfax, Flux, October 21)<br>
<p>
LUZHKOV REITERATES RUSSIA'S CLAIM TO SEVASTOPOL. On the eve of an expected<br>
visit to Moscow by Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma, Moscow mayor Yuri<br>
Luzhkov has repeated his assertion that the strategically important port of<br>
Sevastopol remained subordinate to Moscow and part of the Russian republic<br>
when the rest of Crimea when transferred to Ukraine by Nikita Khrushchev in<br>
1954. Sevastopol, he said, remains part of Russia to this day. (ORT, October<br>
21. See "Perspective" item below)<br>
<p>
MOSCOW TO PROPOSE FREE TRADE WITH U.S. Russia's foreign trade minister said<br>
yesterday that Moscow intends formally to propose a liberalization of trade<br>
relations between the U.S. and Russia with the ultimate goal of "lifting all<br>
trade and economic barriers and creating a single market." Oleg Davydov said<br>
that Moscow will make the proposals during the next session of the<br>
Gore-Chernomyrdin commission, scheduled for December or January. (Itar-Tass,<br>
October 21)<br>
<p>
COLUMBIA TO BUY RUSSIAN MILITARY HELICOPTERS. The Columbian army is to<br>
purchase 10 Mil-17 military helicopters in what has been described as a<br>
Russian "breakthrough" into the Latin American arms market. Earlier this<br>
year the two countries signed a military cooperation agreement. Peru has<br>
also purchased Soviet/Russian arms in the past. (Itar-Tass, October 18 1996)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
YELTSIN PROPOSES NEW POLICY BODY. Russian president Boris Yeltsin dropped a<br>
bombshell yesterday when he met with the speaker of the lower house of the<br>
Russian parliament, Gennady Seleznev. Yeltsin proposed the creation of a<br>
"consultative council" made up of the heads of the top four organs of state<br>
power: himself as president, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and the<br>
speakers of the two houses of the Russian parliament, the Duma and the<br>
Federation Council. "There should be a permanent, so to speak, foursome,"<br>
Yeltsin said. The council should meet not less than once every two weeks to<br>
discuss "the most acute and important state problems." Yeltsin added that,<br>
as long as he himself remains in the sanitarium awaiting heart surgery, the<br>
president would be represented by his chief-of-staff, Anatoly Chubais. (RTR,<br>
Interfax, October 21)<br>
<p>
Yeltsin normally meets every Tuesday with his prime minister, and this week<br>
is no exception. It appears that Yeltsin has floated his idea for the new<br>
body without consulting Chernomyrdin, who will be presented with a fait<br>
accompli at today's meeting with the president. <br>
<p>
There is no obvious constitutional need for a new body. The Russian<br>
constitution is imperfect in many ways, but it does set up a machinery of<br>
government that is adequate to run the state even while the president is<br>
temporarily indisposed. Yeltsin has already transferred some of his powers<br>
to Chernomyrdin for the duration of his sickness, and he has (grudgingly)<br>
undertaken to sign all his powers over to the prime minister while he is<br>
undergoing surgery. It therefore appears that the new body is yet another<br>
manifestation of the ongoing power struggle in the Kremlin. From Chubais'<br>
point of view, it gives the president's chief-of-staff a body on which he<br>
will sit in the same capacity and on the same level as the prime minister.<br>
<i>&gt;From Yeltsin's point of view, the body will serve the useful function of</i><br>
putting Chubais and Chernomyrdin at loggerheads and preventing the two from<br>
ganging up against -- or together trying to oust -- Yeltsin while he is<br>
hospitalized. What the two Communist leaders of the two houses of parliament<br>
expect to get out of the arrangement is so far a mystery.<br>
<p>
Yeltsin has acted wholly in character. He has a propensity for setting up<br>
extra-constitutional bodies to perform functions that constitutional bodies<br>
are failing to fulfill to his liking. At the end of 1993, he set up a<br>
hand-picked assembly to draft a new constitution after he had firebombed the<br>
Supreme Soviet, whose job this would normally have been. Earlier this year<br>
he created the president's Political Consultative Council -- an unelected<br>
body made up of those parties that failed to win election to the Duma.<br>
<p>
KREMLIN DISMAY AT REGIONAL ELECTION RESULTS. There was dismay in pro-Russian<br>
government circles at the outcome of the six elections for regional<br>
governors held on October 20. The chief source of anguish was the<br>
overwhelming victory of nationalist Aleksandr Rutskoi in Kursk oblast.<br>
Despite desperate efforts by local officials to keep him off the ballot,<br>
Rutskoi won just under 79 percent of the vote. Also worrying for the Kremlin<br>
was a victory for the candidate of the Communist/nationalist coalition in<br>
Kirov oblast. Former Yeltsin aide Sergei Filatov called the results in Kursk<br>
and Kirov "a serious defeat for the democratic forces." The re-election of<br>
Kremlin-friendly incumbents in Kaliningrad and Sakhalin oblasts and the<br>
Jewish Autonomous oblast seemed little consolation. The Kremlin also took<br>
little solace in the indeterminate result reached in Pskov oblast, where a<br>
runoff will have to be fought in two weeks between the incumbent governor<br>
and the candidate supported by Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic<br>
party. (RTR, ORT Interfax, October 21)<br>
<p>
CHECHEN PRESIDENT CONFIDENT PEACE PROCESS WILL CONTINUE... In a wide-ranging<br>
interview broadcast on Russian television last night, Chechen president<br>
Zelimkhan Yandarbiev said he regretted that ousted security supremo<br>
Aleksandr Lebed had not been allowed to finish the job he had begun, but<br>
stressed that the Chechen leadership "does not tie the outcome of<br>
negotiations to personalities." (NTV, October 21) The presence of Prime<br>
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's signature on the joint documents signed<br>
earlier this month in Moscow signifies that the peace process will continue,<br>
Yandarbiev said. <br>
<p>
Chechen resistance leaders have never been of one mind regarding which<br>
political forces in Russia to support. During Russia's December 1995<br>
parliamentary elections, the council of commanders of the Chechen resistance<br>
forces called for a halt to raids on Russian territory in the hope that a<br>
Communist victory might lead to a cessation of hostilities on Chechen<br>
territory. But a number of influential field commanders disagreed. "There is<br>
no political force in Russia with whom it makes any sense for us to<br>
negotiate," Shamil Basayev told the Monitor at the time. Basayev seems to<br>
have been skeptical about Lebed's peacemaking activities too, since he has<br>
pointedly distanced himself from the negotiations. In last night's<br>
interview, Yandarbiev admitted that the Chechen leadership has always had to<br>
restrain uncompromising field commanders such as Shamil Basayev and Ruslan<br>
Gelayev.<br>
<p>
...INSISTS ON ELECTIONS AND COMPENSATION. Yandarbiev identified two<br>
immediate problems that need to be resolved. One is the withdrawal of<br>
Russian troops from the republic "to the last soldier." At present, several<br>
thousand Russian troops remain in Chechnya, though nearly 70 percent of<br>
Russian army units and 40 percent of Interior Ministry troops have already<br>
left, according to military sources. (Interfax, October 19) The other is<br>
Yandarbiev's insistence that Russia must compensate Chechnya for the<br>
material, social and moral damage done by Russia's military operations.<br>
Preliminary estimates of the damage amount to $150 billion, Yandarbiev said.<br>
<p>
Yandarbiev insisted that his leadership intends to hold parliamentary and<br>
presidential elections in Chechnya in January 1997, and that the new<br>
president will be sworn in as the president of the independent republic of<br>
Chechnya-Ichkeria. From Moscow's point of view, the Khasavyurt agreements<br>
call for the question of Chechnya's status to be postponed until 2001.<br>
Moscow therefore sees these elections as a violation of the accords. In<br>
Yandarbiev's opinion, there is no such contradiction: "Chechnya is an<br>
independent state and the Khasavyurt accords say only that the question of<br>
relations with the Russian Federation has to be resolved by 2001," he told<br>
Russian television last night.<br>
<p>
AIRBORNE FORCES UNDER SIEGE. Unnamed military sources report that the<br>
Airborne Forces will soon be subordinated to the main command of Russia's<br>
Ground Forces. The change reflects a lowering of the elite paratroopers'<br>
status; they are currently subordinated directly to the defense minister and<br>
General Staff chief, and serve as a reserve force under the Russia's supreme<br>
commander-in-chief, the president. (Interfax, October 19) The change also<br>
reflects a victory for Russia's Ground Forces. Almost since the creation of<br>
the Russian army in 1992 the Ground Forces command has been engaged in a<br>
seemingly losing battle with the Airborne Forces over which service would<br>
become the basis of Russia's mobile forces -- seen as the core of a<br>
restructured military machine. But the mobile forces never got off the<br>
ground, and the ousters of former defense minister Pavel Grachev and former<br>
Security Council secretary Aleksandr Lebed -- political rivals but each a<br>
former paratrooper -- appears to have worked in favor of the Ground Forces<br>
command. A General Staff deputy chief said on October 20 that, following<br>
reductions, the Airborne Forces would retain 2-3 divisions and one or two<br>
brigades. Defense Minister Igor Rodionov put the number of surviving<br>
airborne divisions at two, which in his proposed total of only 12 active<br>
divisions is a significant number. They will remain as a special and<br>
distinctive arm of service, he said. (ORT, October 20; RTV, October 19 and 20)<br>
<p>
On October 17 Russia's Defense Ministry leadership sacked an Airborne Forces<br>
general who had conducted a press conference on a day earlier, during which<br>
he made public the negative reaction of the Airborne Forces leadership to<br>
plans for the speedy disbandment of two of the elite service's current five<br>
divisions. Maj. Gen. Vladimir Kazantsev was dismissed for "violations of<br>
ethical norms" and for "discrediting the top leadership of the Defense<br>
Ministry." (Itar-Tass, October 17. See Monitor, October 16-17) Lebed was<br>
involved in the meeting that led to the press conference, and the dismissal<br>
of Kazantsev was probably aimed at least in part at punishing those who had<br>
associated themselves too publicly with the renegade security chief. <br>

<p>
LITHUANIAN "RIGHTISTS" WINNING ELECTION. Incomplete returns from the first<br>
round of Lithuania's parliamentary election, held on October 20, show the<br>
Fatherland Union/Conservatives capturing a plurality of the votes in the<br>
contest for the 70 parliamentary seats adjudicated by party lists. The FU/C<br>
is followed by the allied Christian Democrats and the governing,<br>
left-of-center Democratic Labor party. Another 71 seats are at stake in<br>
single-mandate constituencies, where FU/C and CD candidates have already won<br>
some seats and lead in many other localities ahead of the November 10<br>
runoff. The two parties, with some smaller allied groups and possibly also<br>
the Center Union, are set to form the new government. FU/C leaders Vytautas<br>
Landsbergis and Gediminas Vagnorius officially announced yesterday that they<br>
expect to become chairman of parliament and prime minister, respectively.<br>

OUTCRY MOUNTS IN UKRAINE OVER RUSSIAN DUMA'S FLEET BILL. Ukrainian president<br>
Leonid Kuchma yesterday telephoned Russian president Boris Yeltsin to<br>
request a meeting, tentatively scheduled for October 24, that will almost<br>
certainly be devoted to discussion of a Russian Duma bill that would halt<br>
the partition of the Black Sea Fleet and declare Sevastopol an exclusive<br>
base of the  Russian fleet. (see Monitor, October 18) With Kuchma present,<br>
the Ukrainian parliament overwhelmingly adopted a resolution warning that it<br>
would demand the immediate withdrawal of the Russian Black Sea Fleet from<br>
Ukrainian territory if the Duma's bill becomes law. The parliament described<br>
the Duma's bill as "openly anti-Ukrainian," as "reaffirming territorial<br>
claims" vis-a-vis Russian jurisdiction over Sevastopol, and as destabilizing<br>
for regional and international security. In a demonstration of national<br>
consensus, Aleksandr Moroz -- the parliament's Socialist chairman and a<br>
political rival of Kuchma -- shepherded the resolution and was publicly<br>
thanked by Kuchma. <br>
<p>
Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko, meanwhile, said in a Russian press<br>
interview that Kiev is "constantly concerned by Russian attempts to question<br>
Ukraine's sovereignty and integrity. There will be no return  to the past."<br>
Justice Minister Serhy Holovaty saw the Duma's bill as a first step toward<br>
conferring on the Black Sea Fleet official status as a Russian force<br>
deployed abroad (see also Moldova item in News section above); and he<br>
cautioned that Yeltsin may be politically or physically unable to veto it.<br>
(UNIAN, Interfax-Ukraine, October 18-21)<br>
<p>
Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said last week that he "hopes" to<br>
visit Kiev shortly to sign an agreement on the fleet's partition based on<br>
terms set "in principle" by the two presidents. That would relegate<br>
agreements on the Russian fleet's legal status in Ukraine and on related<br>
leasing conditions to a later time. But Kiev has all along insisted on a<br>
"package solution" that would include agreements on legal and leasing<br>
issues, rightly anticipating that it would be even more difficult to obtain<br>
recognition of Ukrainian sovereign jurisdiction over Russian naval bases<br>
after the fleet has been divided. <br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
UZBEKISTAN, PAKISTAN RECONCILING POSITIONS ON AFGHANISTAN. Following three<br>
days of talks in Tashkent, Uzbek president Islam Karimov and his Pakistani<br>
counterpart, Faruk Ahmad-khan Leghari, agreed that a resolution of the<br>
conflict in Afghanistan requires a representative government there comprised<br>
of all ethnic, regional, and religious forces. That government should be<br>
formed, they agreed, through direct negotiations among all those forces<br>
under the aegis of the United Nations and the Islamic Conference. The two<br>
presidents called for an immediate termination of hostilities and the<br>
commencement of talks to form a national conciliation government. Leghari<br>
officially endorsed Karimov's proposal for an international embargo on arms<br>
deliveries to Afghanistan. Karimov and Leghari also agreed on the need to<br>
prevent the inter-Afghan conflict from damaging Uzbek-Pakistani relations.<br>
Pakistan underwrites the Taliban, the Islamic movement that last month<br>
captured Kabul. <br>
<p>
The two presidents also discussed in detail proposed oil and gas pipelines<br>
and a transit corridor from Central Asia via Afghanistan to Pakistan's coast<br>
on the Indian Ocean. A possible route considered at the meeting would run<br>
from Termez in Uzbekistan to Mazar-i-Sharif in the ethnic Uzbek area of<br>
Afghanistan, and across Taliban-controlled territory to Pakistan and its<br>
port city Karachi. (Interfax, Western agencies, October 18 through 21)<br>
Turkmenistan is already on board the Pakistan-promoted project and has<br>
normal relations with the Taliban.<br>
<p>
Uzbekistan has strong cards to play in the region. It wields influence in<br>
the ethnic Uzbek areas of Afghanistan and Tajikistan and supports Ahmad<br>
Rashid Dostum's troops. Still not involved in the fighting, they are the<br>
strongest anti-Taliban force in Afghanistan. Uzbekistan's reaction to the<br>
successes of the Taliban has been alarmist, unintentionally playing into the<br>
hands of Russian diplomacy and potentially undermining Karimov's own effort<br>
to maximize Uzbekistan's independence from Russia. An Uzbek-Pakistani<br>
consensus, such as that apparently emerging from the Karimov-Leghari talks,<br>
with the added incentive of the Pakistan-promoted trans-Afghan transit<br>
corridor, could play an important role in pacifying the region and reducing<br>
the openings for Russia's reentry. <br>
<p>
TURKIC SUMMIT FOCUSES ON REGIONAL ECONOMICS. The presidents of Turkey,<br>
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan met in the<br>
Uzbek capital Tashkent on October 20-21 for the annual summit of the Turkic<br>
countries. The presidents reaffirmed their countries' commitment to market<br>
economics and discussed measures to expand regional economic links through<br>
commercial and customs facilities, telecommunications, and overland routes<br>
and pipelines to export Central Asian commodities to international markets.<br>
They also endorsed the plans of the Transcaucasus countries and Pakistan to<br>
create internationally-financed transit corridors that would provide Central<br>
Asia with export outlets to the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean. <br>
<p>
The conferees on the whole avoided discussion of political issues, and<br>
claimed that they did not discuss the situation in Afghanistan and<br>
Tajikistan. They issued a general condemnation of "the phenomenon of<br>
separatism and terrorism" and called for international cooperation to resist<br>
it. Timed to Uzbekistan's celebration of the 660th anniversary of the birth<br>
of Tamerlane, the summit also discussed joint observances of anniversaries<br>
of historic figures and events common to Turkic peoples. (Interfax, Western<br>
agencies, October 20 and 21)<br>
<p>
This was the fourth Turkic summit, and the next one is scheduled for 1997 in<br>
Kazakhstan. Initial omens that such summits would become a vehicle for an<br>
assertive Turkish role in Central Asia have not been borne out. The summits<br>
have increasingly eschewed political, let alone security issues, focusing on<br>
economics and culture -- the latter seen through a decidedly lay prism<br>
consistent with these countries' secular orientation. The countries'<br>
emphasis on individual state-building has precluded pan-Turkism.<br>

JEWISH ORGANIZATION LICENSED IN RUSSIA. The Jewish Agency, a<br>
non-governmental body that promotes Jewish culture and that has facilitated<br>
Jewish immigration to Israel, has been issued a license to operate once<br>
again in Russia. In April the Russian Justice Ministry had refused to renew<br>
the organization's registration. (Itar-Tass, October 17) The U.S. government<br>
had lobbied Moscow energetically on behalf of the Jewish Agency. (See<br>
Monitor, July 5)<br>
<p>
BELLONA REPORT CONFISCATED. On the evening of October 17 Russian Customs<br>
officials in St. Petersburg confiscated some 1500 copies of a report,<br>
produced by the Oslo-based environmental group Bellona, on nuclear hazards<br>
and Russia's Northern Fleet. The confiscation appeared to be another attempt<br>
to intimidate those Russians associated with Bellona and to suppress the<br>
contents of the report. Aleksandr Nikitin, a retired Russian navy captain,<br>
has been charged with treason for his part in preparing the report. (Bellona<br>
press release, October 18)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT TO HELP AILING AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY. The Russian aircraft<br>
industry will not build even 20 planes this year despite a capacity to<br>
produce nearly 200, according to First Deputy Prime Minister Alexei<br>
Bolshakov. He said that a draft resolution to help the industry was being<br>
prepared. It includes a limitation on importing foreign aircraft and a<br>
reduction in the value added tax on Russian planes. Rosvooruzheniye will be<br>
directed to pay its multi-million dollar debts to the aircraft plants in<br>
Saratov and Novosibirsk. (Interfax, October 19)<br>
<p>
RUSSIANS DOWNRANGE OF BAIKONUR WANT IT CLOSED. Residents of Russia's Altai<br>
republic are going to demand that Kazakhstan close its Baikonur Cosmodrome,<br>
currently leased to Russia. Altai lies under the flight path of the space<br>
vehicles launched from Baikonur and over the past 40 years has been sprayed<br>
by an estimated 25,000 metric tons of toxic heptyl fuel, released during the<br>
separation of the second stages of boosters. (Interfax, October 20)<br>
<p>
BEEF BARGAIN OR BLARNEY? The Russian government has demanded that beef from<br>
three counties in the Republic of Ireland--allegedly contaminated by BSE<br>
("mad cow" disease) -- be excluded from the most recent export protocol<br>
between the two countries. Moscow's action has outraged farmers and<br>
politicians in Ireland. The fact that all Irish beef has been deemed safe<br>
enough for sale in Europe, they claim, is evidence that the Russians are<br>
using the BSE scare as a bargaining tactic to lower prices. The potential<br>
consequences for the Irish economy, which depends heavily on beef sales, are<br>
considered serious. (Irish Times, October 16 and 17)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
YELTSIN-LOYALIST APPOINTED TO LEBED'S POSTS. President Yeltsin has dismissed<br>
Aleksandr Lebed from his final remaining post -- presidential envoy to<br>
Chechnya -- and appointed Ivan Rybkin as Security Council secretary and<br>
chief negotiator with Chechnya. Yeltsin's spokesman said the president has<br>
not yet decided whether it is "worth while" appointing someone to Lebed's<br>
third post as security adviser. Yeltsin met with Rybkin on Saturday and, in<br>
a dig at Lebed, told Rybkin to act "within the bounds of the powers given to<br>
the Security Council by the president." (Interfax, Itar-Tass, October 19)<br>
<p>
Rybkin, 50, is Yeltsin's creature and will do what he is told. Originally,<br>
however, the two men were political opponents. Elected to the Russian<br>
Supreme Soviet in 1990, Rybkin belonged to the Communists of Russia faction<br>
and was among the defenders of the Russian White House during the October<br>
1993 parliamentary rebellion. At the end of that year, he was elected to the<br>
Duma as a member of the Agrarian party. When Rybkin was elected speaker of<br>
the Duma in 1994 by a single vote, Yeltsin denounced the election as<br>
"illegal" and "unconstitutional." But Rybkin appears to have been profoundly<br>
affected by his experience under fire in October 1993: he broke with the<br>
Agrarian party and proved so accommodating as speaker that he and Yeltsin<br>
became close allies. Last summer, Yeltsin chose Rybkin to lead one of the<br>
two parties -- the right of center " Russia is Our Home" and the left of<br>
center "Ivan Rybkin's bloc" -- that Yeltsin hoped would evolve into the<br>
two-party system that Russia has so far failed to generate. But Rybkin's<br>
bloc never captured the public imagination (it never even got a proper<br>
name). When it became clear shortly before the election that his party had<br>
no hope of clearing the five percent hurdle for representation in the Duma,<br>
Rybkin tried (and failed) to get the election rules changed. Rybkin himself<br>
was elected in a single-mandate constituency. When the Communists refused to<br>
consider him for speaker, Yeltsin created a job for Rybkin by making him<br>
chairman of the president's Political Consultative Council -- an unelected,<br>
unconstitutional body made up of those parties that failed to clear the five<br>
percent hurdle. This body also failed to win public support and has kept a<br>
low profile.<br>
<p>
CHECHEN OPPOSITION REACTS CAUTIOUSLY TO RYBKIN APPOINTMENT. Chechen<br>
opposition leaders, who initially warned that Lebed's dismissal could lead<br>
to a deterioration of the situation in the breakaway republic, reacted<br>
cautiously to news of Rybkin's appointment. They welcomed Rybkin's statement<br>
that he is committed to a peaceful settlement of the Chechen conflict, and<br>
said they were encouraged by his pledge not to try to revise the Khasavyurt<br>
accords signed in August by Lebed and Chechen chief-of-staff Aslan<br>
Maskhadov. Maskhadov himself reserved judgment, saying Rybkin would be<br>
judged by his deeds. (Itar-Tass, October 19) Predictably, Rybkin's<br>
appointment was warmly welcomed by Chechnya's pro-Russian leader, Doku<br>
Zavgaev, whom Lebed completely ignored. (ORT, October 20) <br>
<p>
The Chechen opposition was also encouraged by a message delivered on October<br>
19 by government official Sergei Stepashin on behalf of Prime Minister<br>
Viktor Chernomyrdin. In it, Chernomyrdin assured Chechen leaders that Russia<br>
would not return to the use of force in Chechnya. (Itar-Tass, October 19)<br>
They may have been less reassured by Chernomyrdin's statement to a meeting<br>
of the Security Council this morning, at which the prime minister introduced<br>
Rybkin as secretary and insisted that Russia will never allow Chechnya to<br>
secede. (Itar-Tass, October 21) They will also not be reassured by the fact<br>
that, as speaker of the Duma, Rybkin was from 1994-95 a member of the<br>
Russian Security Council and was thus a member of the group that decided to<br>
launch a military operation against Chechnya. He therefore seems unlikely to<br>
come up with new ideas about how to resolve the conflict.<br>
<p>
CHECHEN OPPOSITION SETS DATE FOR ELECTIONS, NAMES PRIME MINISTER. Meanwhile,<br>
Chechen opposition leaders pressed ahead with the construction of new state<br>
institutions. They announced that presidential and parliamentary elections<br>
will be held on January 27, and that, until then, Aslan Maskhadov will act<br>
as prime minister and defense minister. They stressed that international<br>
observers, "Russians included," will be welcome to monitor the elections.<br>
(Itar-Tass, October 18) Moscow is far from happy that it was not consulted<br>
over the election date, but does not know what to do to prevent it. In<br>
addition, an anonymous Russian government official told Interfax that Moscow<br>
was much relieved that Maskhadov has been appointed prime minister, seeing<br>
him as a reasonable man with whom Moscow "has done and can do business."<br>
(Interfax, October 20) <br>
<p>
RUTSKOI WINS IN KURSK. Former vice president Aleksandr Rutskoi has been<br>
overwhelmingly elected governor in Russia's Kursk oblast. Provisional<br>
results of yesterday's election give him 77 percent of the vote. (Radio<br>
Liberty, October 21) Kursk, on the Ukrainian border, is part of Russia's<br>
"Red Belt" and Communist candidate Aleksandr Mikhailov had been expected to<br>
defeat the Kremlin-supported incumbent. But Mikhailov stood down on the last<br>
day of campaigning and called voters to support Rutskoi, leader of the<br>
nationalist Derzhava (Great Power) movement. Mikhailov acted after the<br>
presidium of Russia's Supreme Court ordered that Rutskoi should be<br>
registered as a candidate. Initially, local election officials had refused<br>
to register Rutskoi on the grounds that he no longer lives in Kursk, even<br>
though he was born and raised there. The Supreme Court decision left Rutskoi<br>
only 36 hours to campaign, but his battle against the authorities only<br>
increased his popularity. The governorship will give Rutskoi, a former Air<br>
Force general and Afghan vet who led the October 1993 parliamentary<br>
rebellion against Yeltsin, a seat in the upper house of the Russian parliament.<br>
<p>
NEW GENERAL STAFF CHIEF NAMED. The shake-up in Russia's High Command<br>
continued on October 18 as General Staff chief Mikhail Kolesnikov was<br>
replaced by Viktor Samsonov. The two Army Generals may, in fact, be<br>
exchanging posts. Samsonov had overseen coordination of CIS military forces<br>
since 1993, and reports indicated that president Boris Yeltsin, who issued<br>
the appointment order, will propose Kolesnikov for the far less powerful CIS<br>
post. Samsonov had himself been bumped into the CIS post after serving in<br>
1991-1992 as Soviet, and then Russian General Staff chief. (Itar-Tass,<br>
October 18)<br>
<p>
Kolesnikov's replacement had been expected. Although not seen as a loyalist<br>
of either former Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, many of whose closest<br>
associates have recently been relieved of their posts, or of former security<br>
chief Aleksandr Lebed, some of whose allies may face the same fate,<br>
Kolesnikov was reportedly not on the best of terms with Defense Minister<br>
Igor Rodionov. <br>
<p>
The appointment of Samsonov comes at a crucial time. Domestically, Rodionov<br>
seems set to launch a series of military reforms that will include personnel<br>
reductions and wrenching organizational restructuring. The changes are<br>
unlikely to be popular, and Rodionov will need to have the powerful General<br>
Staff on board, particularly because there is already reported to be<br>
considerable dissatisfaction among some General Staff officers with<br>
Rodionov's performance to date as Defense Minister. Samsonov's appointment<br>
also comes as Russia enters what will likely be a period of intense<br>
wrangling with the West over NATO enlargement, Russia-NATO relations, and an<br>
array of arms control and other security issues. The General Staff can be<br>
expected to play a significant role in formulating Russia's positions in all<br>
of these areas. <br>
<p>
THE BALTIC STATES<br>
<p>
RUSSIANS AND LATVIANS CLASH OVER MAIDEN VOYAGE OF PETR VELIKY. While the<br>
first voyage of the nuclear-powered battle cruiser "Petr Veliky" was a short<br>
one, it was not lacking in controversy: the Latvian president said the<br>
ship's presence in the waters off his country reinforced Latvia's<br>
determination to join NATO, a Swedish fighter crashed while investigating<br>
the new warship, and some Latvian officials implied the Russians might have<br>
shot the plane down. <br>
<p>
The Peter the Great was en route from its St. Petersburg shipyard to the<br>
naval base of Baltyisk in the Russian Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad. It had<br>
just been turned over to the Navy, capping a 10 year effort to complete the<br>
ship. The fourth and last of what was once called the "Kirov" class, the<br>
Peter the Great was named after Yuri Andropov when it was laid down in<br>
April, 1986. Work on the ship was halted following the breakup of the Soviet<br>
Union and was only resumed when local St. Petersburg authorities provided<br>
financial help. The powerful ship is heavily armed with both anti-ship and<br>
anti-aircraft missiles. After it completes sea trials it will join the<br>
Pacific Fleet.<br>
<p>
On the evening of October 15 the battle cruiser and its two escorts anchored<br>
23 nautical miles off the Latvian coast. The next day, as the 3 vessels<br>
sailed on toward Baltiysk, a Swedish reconnaissance jet that was trying to<br>
get a close look at the new warship clipped its wing in the sea and crashed,<br>
killing the pilot. At an October 17 press conference, Latvia's armed forces<br>
commander, Juris Dalbins, intimated that the Russian ship had shot down the<br>
plane, a charge that a Russian naval spokesman called "blasphemous and<br>
provocative." (Interfax, October 17) <br>
<p>
In a series of statements October 16-18, Latvia's Foreign Ministry expressed<br>
its "serious concern" over the Russian side's failure to notify Latvia of<br>
the warship's passage and asked Moscow for explanations. Without disputing<br>
Moscow's point that the warships actions had been consistent with<br>
international maritime law, Riga stressed that all countries follow the<br>
practice of prenotifying Latvia of the passage of their warships through its<br>
economic zone, and that this incident constituted the first exception to<br>
that practice since the 1991 restoration of Latvian independence. President<br>
Guntis Ulmanis stated on national television that the incident showed that<br>
"Russian policy is less than peaceable and friendly;" and that Latvia needs<br>
to strengthen its defense capability and join alliances dedicated to common<br>
defense, meaning NATO. (BNS, Russian agencies, October 16 through 19)<br>
<p>
BALTIC STATES UNQUALIFIED FOR NATO, PERRY QUOTED AS TELLING MOSCOW. Pavel<br>
Felgengauer, military analyst for the Russian daily Segodnya, has quoted<br>
U.S. secretary of defense William Perry as saying during an interview that:<br>
"The Baltic States are not ready to join NATO. These countries simply do not<br>
meet the alliance's standards, which call for developed democracy, the<br>
absence of conflicts with neighbors, market economies, and armed forces<br>
capable of operating jointly with NATO." (Segodnya, October 18). In recent<br>
weeks, Perry and other U.S. officials jolted the Baltic states by citing<br>
some of those rationales for postponing consideration of Baltic admission to<br>
NATO. Reinforcing this message in Moscow can feed the perception that it had<br>
all along been addressed not only to the Baltic states but also as a<br>
political signal to Russia. <br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
LUKASHENKO UNCOMPROMISING. Addressing a 6,000-strong, official Assembly of<br>
the Belarus People in Minsk on October 18 and 19, President Aleksandr<br>
Lukashenko unveiled a more confrontational version of his plan to seize<br>
absolute power. Lukashenko announced or implied that his constitutional<br>
draft would: institutionalize the hand-picked Assembly as a permanent<br>
representative forum, parallel to the parliament; empower the president to<br>
appoint state officials, including those of the judiciary branch, with the<br>
consent of only the legislative upper house, many of whose members will also<br>
be presidential appointees; give the upper chamber a name other than Senate<br>
"which is a foreign word, not reflecting Slavic traditions;" apportion<br>
quotas of seats for various social groups in both chambers of the future<br>
parliament, implying presidential preselection of the deputies; and give the<br>
president two additional, seven-year terms if the upcoming referendum<br>
approves his constitutional draft. While accepting the referendum date set<br>
by the parliament, November 24, Lukashenko and his forum demanded that<br>
parliament discard its own constitutional draft which is supposed to be<br>
submitted to the same referendum.<br>
<p>
Lukashenko also claimed that it is his political opponents who are the<br>
"extremists" and who resist the "unification of the fraternal Belarusan and<br>
Russian peoples." He described as "political adventurists" those who signed<br>
the December 1991 Belaya Vezha "scrap of paper" dissolving the USSR, and<br>
said that they "will yet account for the damage they inflicted on our great<br>
people." Lukashenko also cemented his alliance with the Orthodox Church --<br>
sealed in Moscow with Patriarch Aleksy II -- by having the Church head in<br>
Belarus, Metropolitan Filaret, address the Assembly and condemn "the<br>
imperfection of the present constitution which stipulates the equality of<br>
all denominations" at the alleged expense of the Orthodox. Lukashenko, in<br>
turn, urged his parliamentary opponents to repent to Filaret. The<br>
presidential Security Council secretary, Viktor Sheyman, accused<br>
"extremists" of preparing for armed struggle against the president.<br>
(Belaplan, Radio Minsk, Interfax, Itar-Tass, NTV, Western agencies, October<br>
17 through 20)<br>
<p>
ANTI-DICTATORSHIP COALITION STANDS ITS GROUND. The 25 parties and groups<br>
comprising the coalition "in defense of the constitution against<br>
dictatorship" held a congress in Minsk on October 18 and a 20,000-strong<br>
rally the following day. Speakers, including parliament vice-chairman<br>
Hennadz Karpenka, former National Bank president Stanislau Bahdankevich,<br>
Free Trade Unions leader Alyaksandr Bukhvastau, and Popular Front<br>
representatives accused Lukashenko and his government of seeking to<br>
introduce a dictatorship, rejecting economic reforms, and betraying<br>
Belarusan statehood. The speakers warned that Lukashenko could win the<br>
referendum only through fraud and his near-monopoly on the electronic media.<br>
The parliamentary leaders reaffirmed their offer of a "zero option" whereby<br>
both sides would renounce their respective constitutional drafts and abide<br>
by the existing constitution. In Washington, the State Department described<br>
Lukashenko's constitutional draft as anti-democratic and asked him to<br>
immediately seek a compromise with the parliamentary leadership. (Belaplan,<br>
Radio Minsk, Interfax, Itar-Tass, NTV, Western agencies, October 17 through 20)<br>

THE FORTNIGHT IN REVIEW -- A BI-WEEKLY ON THE POST-SOVIET STATES<br>
<p>
<p>
The past two weeks have seen high drama in Moscow, culminating in President<br>
Boris Yeltsin's dismissal of Aleksandr Lebed just months after his<br>
appointment as national security adviser. There was relief when, rather than<br>
resorting to force, Lebed vowed to continue the struggle by constitutional<br>
means. But recent developments in Armenia, Belarus and Moldova, where<br>
elected presidents are using undemocratic methods to cling to power,<br>
underline the fact that other parts of the former Soviet empire also remain<br>
as enigmatic and unpredictable as ever.<br>
<p>
Lebed Latest Casualty of Kremlin Infighting <br>
	Feuding erupted in the Moscow when Russian Interior Minister Anatoly<br>
Kulikov accused his rival, national security chief Aleksandr Lebed, of<br>
plotting to seize power in a coup d'etat. Kulikov had earlier accused Lebed<br>
of betraying Russia's interests and capitulating to the Chechen opposition<br>
by brokering an August cease-fire. Now Kulikov claimed that Lebed was<br>
mustering a secret force and plotting political assassinations with the help<br>
of Chechen gunmen. Dismissing the charges, Lebed demanded a meeting with<br>
ailing President Boris Yeltsin. And, for the third time in two months, Lebed<br>
threatened to resign.<br>
	Yeltsin was at pains to show that he was still in control of events.<br>
Appearing on Russian television on October 17, the frail-looking president<br>
announced that he was sacking Lebed as Security Council secretary. Yeltsin<br>
said he could no longer tolerate Lebed's "mistakes," his quarreling with<br>
government ministers, and his habit of taking of decisions without proper<br>
authority. Yeltsin made it clear, too, that he was irritated by Lebed's<br>
presidential ambitions.<br>
	Yeltsin made no reference to the coup allegations that sparked the crisis,<br>
confirming suspicions that Kulikov's charges were a pretext to remove Lebed<br>
from office. The clash between the two security chiefs seemed to spring from<br>
more than mere personal rivalry and to mark a power struggle between rival<br>
Kremlin clans, jockeying to fill the vacuum created by Yeltsin's prolonged<br>
hospitalization. There were as a result widespread expectations that that<br>
fresh splits would soon appear and that other sackings were likely to follow.<br>
<p>
Ouster Casts Cloud Over Chechnya Peace Process <br>
	There was confusion in Moscow over what Lebed's ouster would mean for the<br>
Chechen peace process. Lebed warned it could lead to disaster. Chechen<br>
opposition leaders also reacted with alarm to signs that the Kremlin "war<br>
party" was in the ascendant. What happens in Chechnya may prove as important<br>
as the state of Yeltsin's health in determining future developments in<br>
Moscow. If Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin manages to assert control, he<br>
will be under strong pressure to continue the peace process as a means of<br>
boosting his own presidential prospects. But if Kulikov and the war party<br>
gain control of Moscow's policy toward Chechnya, renewed bloodshed seems the<br>
unhappy probability and popular sympathy for Lebed will grow.<br>
<p>
Chechens Press on Regardless <br>
	While Russia's leaders exchanged threats and accusations, Chechen<br>
opposition leaders pressed ahead with the construction of state institutions<br>
in the breakaway republic. The final touches were being put to a provisional<br>
coalition government, to be led by Aslan Maskhadov. Opposition leaders also<br>
announced that presidential and parliamentary elections would be held in<br>
late January. Moscow officials, taken aback, objected that January was too<br>
soon and that Chechen leaders had no right to take unilateral decisions on<br>
such important matters. Given the lack of consensus in Moscow, however,<br>
there seemed little Moscow could do to prevent the Chechen leadership from<br>
carrying out their plans.<br>
<p>
Skirmishing Over Military Reform<br>
Russia's military reform lurched uncertainly into gear in early October, but<br>
the accompanying Kremlin intrigue suggested that personalities and politics<br>
remained more important than policies in the Russian defense establishment.<br>
Developments were keyed by the first meeting of Russia's recently-created<br>
Defense Council on October 4, at which government leaders and chiefs of<br>
Russia's armed forces and security structures examined proposals for reform.<br>
Reports of the closed-door meeting indicated that participants approved a<br>
Defense Ministry proposal to cut the size of the regular armed forces from<br>
1.5 to 1.2 million men while liquidating scores of low-readiness or<br>
poorly-manned units. The transition to an all-volunteer force, which<br>
President Yeltsin pledged during his campaign would be completed by the year<br>
2000, will instead be delayed until the year 2005. Reports also suggested<br>
that military spending will rise next year to cover current funding arrears<br>
and to pay for the proposed reductions, but the longer-term goal was said to<br>
be a smaller military that would be cheaper to maintain.<br>
	Politically, the October 4 meeting highlighted the potential importance of<br>
the Defense Council as a counterweight to Aleksandr Lebed's Security<br>
Council. Indeed, Lebed chose pointedly not to attend the meeting, which was<br>
presided over by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. Lebed's absence was also at<br>
least in part a result of Yeltsin's decision a week earlier to name Defense<br>
Council secretary Yury Baturin -- not Lebed -- as head of a presidential<br>
commission overseeing appointments to top defense posts. Baturin's<br>
appointment at last cleared the way for Defense Minister Igor Rodionov to<br>
begin consolidating his position within the military bureaucracy. On October<br>
4 it was announced that Rodionov had been promoted to Army General and that<br>
six top commanders -- all said to be opponents of the announced defense cuts<br>
-- had been dismissed. Russian commentators suggested that Lebed's influence<br>
within the defense establishment had been weakened by his failure to win<br>
control over top appointments, and that adroit maneuvering by his opponents<br>
might also have weakened ties between Lebed and Rodionov.<br>
	Lebed returned the fray on October 16, lambasting a General Staff directive<br>
that ordered reductions in Russia's elite Airborne forces. Those cuts had<br>
been anticipated following the October 4 meeting and, indeed, the outspoken<br>
commander of the Airborne troops had been among the six generals dismissed<br>
on that day. Lebed characterized the directive as a product of Kremlin<br>
intrigues that, he claimed, were really aimed at destroying the Airborne<br>
Forces altogether. The retired general (and former Airborne commander)<br>
alleged that the directive was part of a mistaken and dangerous effort to<br>
decentralize the government and the army, and warned that its implementation<br>
could ignite a social explosion and further inflame dissatisfaction with the<br>
armed forces.<br>
<p>
Lebed Puzzles NATO <br>
	During and after a visit to NATO headquarters in Brussels on October 6-8<br>
(his first visit to the West), Aleksandr Lebed surprised audiences by<br>
depicting the West as "civilized" and the alliance as an organization with<br>
which Russia could do business. Although he reiterated Russian objections to<br>
NATO's enlargement, Lebed deplored the confrontational policy toward NATO<br>
that Russia has pursued to date, and said that Moscow was foolish not to<br>
participate more actively in the Partnership for Peace program. Lebed's<br>
accommodating words drew fire from the Russian Duma, which demanded that he<br>
appear before them later this month. His remarks also left the Foreign<br>
Ministry scrambling to restate its categorical opposition to enlargement and<br>
its demand that any political agreement with NATO must grant Moscow a voice<br>
in the alliance's affairs. Lebed had criticized the alliance on several<br>
occasions before traveling to Brussels, and his behavior on that occasion<br>
may have been aimed at appearing "presidential" in his first appearance on<br>
the world stage. Informed sources told the Jamestown Foundation, too, that<br>
high-ranking NATO officials were left in confusion by the way in which Lebed<br>
switched in Brussels from one line in one meeting to an apparently<br>
contradictory one in the next. In their public reactions, therefore, Western<br>
leaders welcomed Lebed's constructive remarks; privately, they expressed<br>
uncertainty whether Lebed's statements represented a real departure from the<br>
Kremlin's official hard line. <br>
<p>
Russia Judged World's Most Dangerous Emerging Market <br>
	Financial markets were briefly unsettled by the fireworks between Kulikov<br>
and Lebed, but quickly returned to normal as investors concluded that<br>
allegations of private armies and coups d'etats were made for political<br>
effect. Many investors seem now to have decided that the potential rewards<br>
of investing in Russia outweigh the risks. Earlier this month, U.S. and<br>
European credit-rating agencies awarded Russia its first long-term credit<br>
rating since the 1917 Revolution. Russia's BB grading was higher than<br>
expected, and put it on a level with Hungary, Mexico, India and Slovakia. A<br>
different picture emerged, however, from a study of political risk in<br>
emerging markets conducted by the Merchant International Group (MIG). On the<br>
basis of personal interviews with 2,500 western business people, MIG<br>
concluded that corruption, fraud and bureaucratic delays make Russia a<br>
riskier place to do business than Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil or Indonesia --<br>
though less than Nigeria.<br>
	The slow progress of Russia's application to join the World Trade<br>
Organization (WTO) also underlined the gap between Moscow's aspirations and<br>
achievements. A high-level Russian delegation was in Geneva on October 15-16<br>
for a further, inconclusive round of negotiations on Russia's application.<br>
Russia still has to convince the WTO that its trading practices are in line<br>
with world standards. Doubt centers on the lack of predictability and<br>
transparency in Russia's trade reforms. There has been a considerable<br>
liberalization of Russian trade, including the establishment of<br>
current-account ruble convertibility and abandonment of almost all direct<br>
administrative controls on exports and imports. But domestic price controls<br>
on oil have not been completely removed; subsidies to coal, steel and other<br>
producers are understood to continue; and there has recently been some<br>
tendency to raise protective import duties. Beyond those specific issues,<br>
there is a widespread perception that Russian economic policy-making remains<br>
unstable. That includes the making of foreign economic policy, where changes<br>
in tariffs, the granting to government cronies of exemptions from the<br>
payment of duties, and abrupt and sometimes retroactive changes in the tax<br>
regime facing foreign companies in Russia have all drawn adverse comment.<br>
The credibility of the Russian government as a partner in the development of<br>
world trading policies still remains rather low. A period of stable and<br>
consistent conduct of trade policy in Moscow is probably needed before<br>
Russia is likely to be treated more warmly in international organizations<br>
such as the WTO.<br>
<p>
ELSEWHERE IN THE CIS, DEMOCRACY TAKES A TUMBLE <br>
<p>
	Old habits die hard. Still taking their cue from Moscow and following in<br>
Yeltsin's footsteps, the presidents of Belarus, Armenia and Moldova have<br>
redoubled their efforts to concentrate state power in their own hands. The<br>
three presidents vary in personality and temperament and their countries<br>
differ in many important aspects. All three presidents have nonetheless<br>
embarked on the road to personal and authoritarian rule, seeking to control<br>
and manipulate the democratic institutions that emerged during the last days<br>
of the USSR and the first years of independent statehood. Each of the<br>
presidents is now attempting to use elections (or a referendum) in an effort<br>
to beat national parliaments into submission and to eliminate political<br>
opposition to presidential fiat.<br>
	The three countries' international orientation, their choice of alliances<br>
and their alignments constitute the ultimate stake in these internal<br>
conflicts. Nevertheless, the West has yet to clarify its interests in any of<br>
the three countries or to act to further those interests.<br>
<p>
Belarus: President and Parliament Battle it out<br>
	In Belarus, President Aleksandr Lukashenko has drafted a new constitution<br>
that confers sweeping powers on the president while emasculating the<br>
parliament and the Constitutional Court. Lukashenko has scheduled a November<br>
referendum to have his constitution adopted and pave the way for dissolving<br>
parliament and dismissing the Court. The president has ordered the Finance<br>
Ministry to fund the referendum (allegedly from "working people's"<br>
donations) and instructed local state bodies to administer the referendum.<br>
The exercise contravenes the existing constitution and other legislation,<br>
which state that only parliament may call a referendum and only the Central<br>
Election Commission may administer it. Exercising its prerogative,<br>
parliament has scheduled a counter-referendum for later in the month, in<br>
which voters will be asked to choose between competing constitutional<br>
drafts. One draft is that sanctioned by the president and the other, which<br>
would abolish the presidency and transform Belarus into a purely<br>
parliamentary republic, is sponsored by parliament. The president has<br>
responded by forbidding the state authorities to finance or cooperate in any<br>
way with parliament's referendum. He has ignored not only the law and<br>
parliamentary decisions but also the Constitutional Court, which has found<br>
no fewer than sixteen presidential decrees to be in violation of the<br>
constitution.<br>
	A large number of parliamentarians, as well as the Constitutional Court and<br>
the Central Election Commission, are resisting Lukashenko's bid for power.<br>
They are supported by a coalition of 24 parliamentary and extraparliamentary<br>
parties and groups spanning the two poles of what may be termed the<br>
constitutional front. Given the unexpected strength of the resistance,<br>
Moscow and top Russian Communists have urged Lukashenko to secure at least<br>
some measure of parliamentary support for his policy of "reintegration" with<br>
Russia.<br>
	The president has accordingly set about splitting the two largest<br>
parliamentary groups, the Agrarians and the Communists. Most of these<br>
deputies double as directors of factories, state and collective farms or<br>
government bodies. Simultaneously, therefore, they act as links in the<br>
"vertical administrative mechanism" created and headed by Lukashenko. This<br>
makes them vulnerable to both threats and financial inducements doled out by<br>
the president and government. The president has, moreover, promised that<br>
obedient deputies will be employed in the new -- and powerless -- parliament<br>
he proposes to create.<br>
	Lukashenko has scheduled his referendum on November 7. Parliament may go<br>
ahead with its own referendum on November 24. The stage seems set for<br>
continuing confrontation.<br>
<p>
Armenia: International Organizations Criticize Presidential Election<br>
	In Armenia, fallout continues from a fraudulent presidential election.<br>
Following the first round, held on September 22, the authorities took a<br>
whole week to count the votes and declare that incumbent president Levon<br>
Ter-Petrosian had won 51.75 percent of the vote, against 41.3 percent for<br>
Vazgen Manukian, candidate of the opposition National Accord bloc. Official<br>
returns suggested that, even if electoral fraud was not as systematic as the<br>
opposition claimed, it was enough to tip Ter-Petrosian over the 50 percent<br>
mark and avoid the necessity of a runoff. Mass protests, which degenerated<br>
into a mob attempt to overrun the parliament and Central Election Commission<br>
offices, were answered by the authorities with a crackdown on the opposition<br>
as a whole. Police closed down the offices of opposition parties and<br>
arrested several prominent opposition figures. The better known were<br>
eventually released, but not before criminal proceedings had been instituted<br>
against them. Eight opposition deputies were stripped of parliamentary<br>
immunity and expelled from the chamber, almost entirely eliminating the<br>
opposition's parliamentary representation.<br>
	Armenia's post-election crackdown capped a process that was already<br>
discernible during the 1995 parliamentary elections. Those elections were<br>
also marred by government-perpetrated fraud, and saw the suspension of the<br>
main opposition party -- the Armenian Revolutionary Federation,<br>
Dashnaksutiun. Western countries and international organizations tended to<br>
treat these early warnings with relative indifference. They seem thereby<br>
unintentionally to have invited more serious transgressions, as the recent<br>
presidential election and ensuing repression suggest. <br>
	The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which<br>
observed Armenia's presidential election, issued a strongly worded<br>
assessment of the ballot. OSCE monitors observed "numerous irregularities,"<br>
including unlawful police presence at voting stations, ballot-stuffing, and<br>
refusal by electoral officials to consider opposition complaints. The report<br>
pointed out that more than 22,000 votes could not be traced to any<br>
registered voter, while a further 21,000 ballots were missing and<br>
unaccounted for. Since Ter-Petrosian scraped the 50 percent threshold by a<br>
mere 22,000 votes, the OSCE concluded that these disparities alone were<br>
enough to cast doubt on the results. Both the OSCE and the Washington-based<br>
International Foundation for Electoral Systems called on the authorities to<br>
investigate the violations and review the election returns. They stopped<br>
short, however, of recommending that the election should be invalidated. <br>
	In the circumstances, any official review of the returns looks highly<br>
unlikely. International pressure is lacking, and the authorities have the<br>
internal situation well in hand. The three "power" ministers are personal<br>
and political supporters of the president, and the defense minister stated<br>
on national television that the security ministries would not accept an<br>
opposition victory, "even if they won 100 percent of the vote."<br>
	Local elections will be held in Armenia on November 11. Opposition parties<br>
say they are unable to campaign freely, their press is gagged, and their<br>
leaders are facing the threat of criminal prosecution. In other words, the<br>
stage in Armenia is set, like that in Belarus, for an exercise in<br>
undemocratic elections.<br>
<p>
Moldova: Institutionalizing Presidential Rule <br>
	Democratic elections may soon be an endangered species in Moldova, too.<br>
President Mircea Snegur has cemented an opportunistic alliance with the<br>
ultranationalist Popular Front which he hopes will enable him to win<br>
reelection. The Popular Front wants to unite Moldova with Romania, and it is<br>
not squeamish about authoritarian methods. Now Snegur and the Front are<br>
campaigning to change the constitution, dissolve parliament and dismiss the<br>
government through a combination of presidential fiat and social agitation<br>
against reforms. The president is blaming the social costs of the reforms --<br>
which he himself launched -- on the governing Agrarian Democratic party and<br>
on his challengers for the presidency, Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli and<br>
parliamentary Speaker Petru Lucinschi. <br>
	To advance his quest for personal rule, the president has launched a front<br>
organization called the "Pro-Snegur Movement." Moldova is a multiethnic<br>
country, but this is a monoethnic organization. The president is also<br>
seeking to create instruments of force under his personal control. He has<br>
assumed "direct command" over the armed forces even though the law empowers<br>
the president to do so only in a state of national emergency and with<br>
parliamentary approval; he also unilaterally placed the service for the<br>
protection of the president, government and parliament under exclusive<br>
presidential subordination, declining to account for most of its activities<br>
and vetoing parliamentary legislation which envisaged parliamentary and<br>
governmental control over that service. The Constitutional Court, showing<br>
far less courage than its counterpart in Belarus, is emitting uncertain<br>
signals which may discourage the parliament and government from running the<br>
risk of appealing to the Court. Democracy may as a result be in danger of a<br>
serious setback. <br>

<p>
DUMA SUPPORTS YELTSIN. The lower house of the Russian Duma voted today to<br>
approve President Boris Yeltsin's dismissal of national security aide<br>
Aleksandr Lebed. (Itar-Tass, October 18. See "perspective" items below)<br>
<p>
RUSSIA JUDGED MOST DANGEROUS EMERGING MARKET. Earlier this month, U.S. and<br>
European credit-rating agencies awarded Russia its first long-term credit<br>
rating since the 1917 Revolution. Russia's BB grading was higher than<br>
expected, putting it on a level with Hungary, Mexico, India and Slovakia,<br>
and above Turkey, Venezuela and Brazil. (Segodnya, October 8; The Economist,<br>
October 12) Now the research consultancy Merchant International Group (MIG)<br>
has announced the findings of its own survey. On the basis of personal<br>
interviews with 2,500 western companies, MIG finds Russia to be the riskiest<br>
of the emerging markets for foreign investors. Complaints about high levels<br>
of corruption, fraud, and bureaucratic delays combine to make Russia a more<br>
dangerous place to do business than Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil and Indonesia<br>
-- but less dangerous than Nigeria.(BBC World Service, October 17)<br>
<p>
RUSSIA LOOKS TO THE MIDDLE EAST. A Russian diplomatic spokesman yesterday<br>
depicted Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov's upcoming visit to the Middle<br>
East as a reflection of Moscow's intention to play a more active role in<br>
diplomatic developments there. He also described the Middle East as one of<br>
Russia's diplomatic priorities. Primakov is to visit Syria, Lebanon, Egypt,<br>
Israel, the Palestinian autonomy, and Jordan during the October 28-November<br>
3 trip. (Interfax, October 17)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN NAVY TO GET NEW STRATEGIC SUBMARINE. Adm. Feliks Gromov, the<br>
commander in chief of the Russian Navy, announced yesterday that work would<br>
start next week on a new-generation strategic nuclear-powered submarine. He<br>
said it would be two or three times more powerful than any submarine now in<br>
the fleet. Last week, another top admiral spoke of a new submarine, to be<br>
named the "Yuri Dolgoruky," without identifying it's type. (Itar-Tass<br>
October 10, Interfax October 17)<br>
<p>
CIS COUNTRIES REJECT MOSCOW'S ATTEMPT TO SPEAK FOR THEM TO NATO. Meeting in<br>
Moscow yesterday, the Council of Foreign Ministers of CIS member countries<br>
turned down a Russian proposal to empower the secretary-general of the CIS<br>
Collective Security Council (CSC) to represent CIS countries in discussions<br>
with NATO. (Itar-Tass, October 17) The CSC consists of heads of the states<br>
signatory to the 1992 CIS collective security treaty and the<br>
commanders-in-chief of those countries' armed forces. The secretary-general<br>
heads the CSC's permanent staff in Moscow.=20<br>
<p>
BALTIC STATES FINGERED BY PRIMAKOV. Meeting in Moscow yesterday with the UN<br>
high commissioner for refugees, Sadako Ogata, Russian foreign minister<br>
Yevgeny Primakov attempted to underscore what he described as "the danger of<br>
mass emigration from Estonia and Latvia because of the continuing<br>
discrimination policy against permanent residents deprived of citizenship."<br>
(Interfax, October 17) The accusation ignores the twin facts that<br>
specialized international organizations have found no such discrimination,<br>
and that the mass of Soviet-era Russian settlers, whom the Baltic states<br>
accepted as permanent residents, may freely choose Russian citizenship and<br>
repatriation.<br>
<p>
"WAGES, RIP?" A gravestone inscribed "Wages, RIP. We remember you. Date of<br>
death: October 1995," has been unveiled in the far northern Russian city of<br>
Krasnoyarsk. Some workers there have not been paid for 12 months.<br>
(Izvestiya, October 17)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
YELTSIN SHOWS WHO'S BOSS; SACKS LEBED. Appearing on Russian television<br>
yesterday, Russian president Boris Yeltsin announced that he was sacking<br>
security adviser Aleksandr Lebed from all his posts. Yeltsin said he could<br>
no longer tolerate Lebed's "mistakes," his constant quarreling with other<br>
ministers, his taking of decisions without proper authorization, and the<br>
fact that he was openly running what amounted to an election campaign.<br>
Yeltsin signed the dismissal in front of the televisions cameras. (ORT,<br>
October 17) Though Yeltsin looked frail, he succeeded in showing that, in a<br>
crunch, he still controls events.=20<br>
<p>
Yeltsin made no reference to the allegations that sparked the crisis:<br>
charges by Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov that Lebed was planning a coup.<br>
This bears out suspicions that Kulikov's charges were fabricated to remove<br>
Lebed from the Kremlin. The affair is reminiscent of the charges made in<br>
June against Kremlin security chiefs Aleksandr Korzhakov and Mikhail<br>
Barsukov. That affair is commonly believed to have been masterminded by<br>
Anatoly Chubais, whom Lebed yesterday identified as the man primarily<br>
responsible for his own ouster. The way Lebed was brought onto the Kremlin<br>
team in June to help Yeltsin win reelection is also reminiscent of Yeltsin's<br>
use of another general, Aleksandr Rutskoi, whose presence on the ticket<br>
helped Yeltsin win election in 1991. Once Rutskoi had served his purpose,<br>
Yeltsin dropped him too.<br>
<p>
Commentators agree that this week's events go deeper than a mere clash of<br>
personalities between Lebed and Kulikov, and predict that other Kremlin<br>
divisions will soon appear, perhaps between Chubais and Prime Minister<br>
Viktor Chernomyrdin.<br>
<p>
FORMER SECURITY CHIEF UNREPENTANT. Lebed reacted calmly, telling a Moscow<br>
press conference last night that he plans to take a short rest but will<br>
remain in politics. He said Kremlin insiders decided he had to go just two<br>
days after he gave Yeltsin a report identifying those responsible for the<br>
brutal war in Chechnya. He also said that he was merely the first to lose<br>
his job; he alleged that Kulikov had prepared a hit-list and that other<br>
dismissals will soon follow. (BBC, October 17; Nezavisimaya gazeta, October<br>
18) Lebed's press conference, widely reported by the Western media, got<br>
noticeably scant coverage on state-sponsored Russian television.<br>
<p>
Lebed is now expected to launch his presidential election campaign in<br>
earnest. The general feeling is that he has emerged from the events of the<br>
past two days as a net winner. His popularity is intact and his profile<br>
among the Russian electorate, which has little affection for its present<br>
leaders, is high. Should Yeltsin leave the scene any time soon, Lebed's<br>
chances of succeeding him must be high. The main thing Lebed has to fear is<br>
the possibility that Yeltsin will serve out his full five year term and that<br>
Lebed will have to survive in the wilderness. But the consensus is that it<br>
was Yeltsin who took the greater risk in sacking Lebed and that the<br>
charismatic general may prove even more troublesome outside the Kremlin than<br>
inside.<br>
<p>
LEBED'S POPULARITY IS HIGH. A series of surveys conducted by Moscow's VCIOM<br>
polling agency between May and September showed that public confidence in<br>
Lebed rose during the summer and has since remained stable, whereas<br>
confidence in the other two leading political figures, President Yeltsin and<br>
Communist party leader Gennady Zyuganov, has fallen since the summer. A poll<br>
conducted in mid-September found that seven Russians out of  ten approved of<br>
the way Lebed was doing his job as security chief, including his efforts to<br>
halt the war in Chechnya. Lebed's support is highest among men and, in<br>
particular, security personnel. (U.S. Information Agency, Office of Research<br>
and Media Reaction, October 7)=20<br>
<p>
At present, Lebed's biggest handicap is his lack of institutional support.<br>
Pro-Lebed organizations are springing up, however. The Monitor's<br>
correspondent in Saratov reports that a branch of Lebed's "For Truth and<br>
Order" movement was set up in that Volga city on October 8. The initiative<br>
came from people who voted for Lebed in the presidential election; also<br>
represented were the Congress of Russian Communities, the Democratic Party<br>
of Russia, and one of Saratov's Cossack organizations. Yabloko sent an<br>
observer. The new organization plans to support candidates in the local<br>
elections due to be held in Saratov Oblast in December.<br>
<p>
Branches of "For Truth and Order" have also sprung up in a number of<br>
military training schools in Moscow and Moscow region. Several thousand<br>
officers are said to be involved. This could be used against Lebed since<br>
political agitation is illegal in the Russian military; the Justice Ministry<br>
is reportedly considering an investigation into the matter. (ORT, October=<br>
 16)<br>
<p>
OUSTER OF LEBED CASTS CLOUD OVER CHECHNYA PEACE PROCESS. There is confusion<br>
in Moscow today as to what Lebed's ouster will mean for negotiations between<br>
Russian and Chechen leaders. Lebed warned yesterday that his sacking could<br>
result in disaster for the Chechnya peace process. Chechen opposition<br>
leaders also reacted with alarm to signs that the "party of war" is again in<br>
the ascendant. But the Kremlin is being quoted as saying that Lebed was not<br>
dismissed from his role as head of the Russian team negotiating with the<br>
Chechen opposition. It is not yet clear, says the BBC, which reported this<br>
news today, whether this is an oversight or whether Yeltsin intended Lebed<br>
to continue in the post. (BBC World Service, October 18)=20<br>
<p>
Meanwhile, the newly-appointed Joint Commission held its first meeting in<br>
Grozny yesterday. It was presided over by the newly appointed co-chairmen,<br>
Valentin Vlasov on the Russian side, and Husein Bibulatov, deputy prime<br>
minister in the coalition government now taking shape, on the Chechen side.<br>
(Interfax, October 17) The tasks of the Joint Commission are primarily<br>
economic -- first and foremost, ensuring that the population survives the<br>
coming winter.<br>
<p>
TOUGH SLEDDING FOR PERRY OVER START II. U.S. defense secretary William Perry<br>
yesterday had far less success convincing Russian legislators that they<br>
should ratify the START II nuclear arms reduction treaty than he did when<br>
trying to accomplish the same mission before the U.S. Senate last January.<br>
Perry spent more than two hours answering questions from members of the<br>
three committees involved in the treaty's ratification. U.S. sources said<br>
most of the questions came from treaty opponent Vladimir Zhirinovsky and<br>
members of his Liberal Democratic party. After the meeting, Zhirinovsky was<br>
quoted as saying that his party would "not cast a single vote" in favor of<br>
ratification. He was also said to have accused the U.S. and "the world<br>
government" of having plans to dismember Russia by the year 2025. (VOA,<br>
Interfax, October 17)<br>
<p>
Others were more moderate but still opposed. Retired gen. Lev Rokhlin,<br>
chairman of the Duma's defense committee, repeated Russians' concerns about<br>
NATO moving closer to their border, and said that START II would cement<br>
Russia's nuclear inferiority vis-=E0-vis the U.S. because Moscow would not=<br>
 be<br>
able to afford to restructure its strategic forces to take full advantage of<br>
the treaty's limits. Vladimir Lukin, who heads the Duma's International<br>
Affairs Committee, was another skeptic. After the meeting, he told Interfax<br>
that the chances the Duma would ratify the treaty were "quite insignificant.<br>
If we are not listened to [by NATO], if it is not understood there are<br>
things that are harmful for our security, it is very difficult to persuade<br>
deputies to vote for the reduction of the most powerful Russian armaments."<br>
The chairman of the Duma's Subcommittee on Arms Control and International<br>
Security did not even attend the meeting. An aide of retired general Boris<br>
Gromov said that Gromov did not want "to participate in a show, the purpose<br>
of which is least of all to search for ways to promote Russian-American<br>
dialogue." (Interfax, October 17)<br>
<p>
C I S AFFAIRS<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN-PROPOSED FINANCIAL AGREEMENTS FALL THROUGH. A joint session of the<br>
CIS Interstate Currency Committee and the Council of the Interstate Bank,<br>
held on October 16 in Moscow and chaired by Russian Central Bank president<br>
Sergei Dubinin, failed to adopt all three draft agreements on "deeper<br>
integration" presented by the Russian side. The first draft agreement<br>
envisaged establishing mutual convertibility of the national currencies of<br>
all CIS member countries for payments in intra-CIS trade and services -- in<br>
practice a step toward a payments union. The second draft stipulated common<br>
principles of customs control, including the member states' obligation to<br>
report all cross-border movements of goods and banking transactions to a<br>
central authority -- in effect a supranational organ. The third Russian<br>
proposal would have increased the Interstate Bank's statutory capital from 5<br>
to 55 billion rubles. All member countries either rejected outright or asked<br>
for changes in the first two drafts; and only some of the countries --<br>
presumably the more impoverished ones -- declared an interest in further<br>
discussions of the revised documents. The third proposed agreement has been<br>
relegated for possible reconsideration at an unspecified future time.<br>
(Interfax, October 16)<br>
<p>
THE BALTIC STATES<br>
<p>
LITHUANIA ELECTING NEW PARLIAMENT. Lithuania will elect a new parliament in<br>
two rounds of balloting on October 20 and November 10. Half of the total<br>
number of deputies are being elected under the proportional system based on<br>
party lists, and the other half in single-mandate constituencies.<br>
Twenty-four parties and numerous individual candidates are competing. Public<br>
opinion surveys suggest that the governing Democratic Labor party (DLP) -- a<br>
left-of-center, social-democrat-type party that developed from the<br>
Lithuanian Communist party's reformist and pro-independence wing -- faces<br>
defeat by a "right-wing" and right-of-center coalition. The DLP had won an<br>
absolute majority in the last parliamentary elections in 1992, but has since<br>
been weakened by corruption scandals and mismanagement. It has also suffered<br>
significant defections, and last week saw its leader and former prime<br>
minister, Adolfas Slezevicius, arraigned on charges of misuse of office.<br>
Attempting to stave off a serious defeat, the DLP government announced<br>
yesterday a 10 percent increase in pensions, effective November 1, and a<br>
similar increase in the salaries of public employees, effective December 1.<br>
It failed, however, to identify funding sources in the budget.=20<br>
<p>
The six-party rightist alliance is based on former president Vytautas<br>
Landsbergis' Fatherland Union/The Conservatives and former foreign minister<br>
Algirdas Saudargas' Christian Democrat Party; the two men led Lithuania's<br>
struggle for independence in 1989-1991. The alliance has the support of<br>
Lithuanian-American ecologist Valdas Adamkus, who consistently tops<br>
Lithuanian political popularity polls. The rightist parties have pledged to<br>
support each other's candidates in the runoffs. In the last electoral<br>
consultation -- the 1995 local elections -- Fatherland Union received more<br>
than 30 percent of the votes country-wide from a field of 17 parties, and<br>
currently administers 35 out of 56 municipalities and districts. (ELTA,<br>
Radio Vilnius, October 15 through 17)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
FALLOUT IN KIEV FROM RUSSIAN DUMA'S BLACK SEA FLEET BILL. Ukrainian<br>
officials are expressing concern over the Russian Duma's overwhelming<br>
approval on first reading of a draft law "On halting the partition of the<br>
Black Sea Fleet." (See Monitor, October 17) Deputy foreign minister<br>
Kostyantyn Hrishchenko told a briefing that Kiev is "particularly worried"<br>
by statements during the Duma debate suggesting that the draft law had been<br>
coordinated with Russia's Foreign Ministry, which was said to have "agreed<br>
with 80 percent of it." Concern was also expressed over the territorial<br>
claim implied in the stipulations on exclusive basing rights in Sevastopol<br>
for Russia, and over the voting margin of 370 to 5, which suggests to Kiev<br>
that most Duma deputies "willingly yield to demagoguery." Hrishchenko was<br>
hopeful that countries friendly to Ukraine and the OSCE will react to the<br>
Duma's move. First deputy foreign minister Anton Butenko cautioned that the<br>
Duma's vote could derail the negotiations between the executive branches of<br>
the two governments. The Socialist chairman of parliament, Oleksandr Moroz,<br>
departed from his usual caution toward Moscow by publicly telling Russia to<br>
build a naval base on the Russian coast of the Black Sea if it refuses to<br>
share Sevastopol with the Ukrainian fleet. (UNIAN, Interfax-Ukraine, October<br>
16 and 17).=20<br>
<p>
The Russian draft law, prepared by deputies of the nationalist<br>
Narodovlastiye group, must pass through at least one more reading in the<br>
Duma before being referred to the Federation Council for its approval and<br>
finally to president Boris Yeltsin for signing into law. Yeltsin's<br>
representative in the Duma stated that the president would veto the bill "in<br>
its present form." Kiev is counting on that veto, but Yeltsin's health<br>
problems suggest that Kiev's hope hangs on a thin thread.<br>
<p>
REGIONAL SECURITY AT STAKE IN BELARUS POLITICAL CONFLICT. Upon completion of<br>
his working visit to Moscow (see Monitor, October 17), Belarus president<br>
Aleksandr Lukashenko stated that he had held "lengthy talks" with Russian<br>
defense minister Igor Rodionov on, among other issues, the joint activities<br>
of Russian and Belarusan air defense forces and border troops protecting the<br>
"Russia-Belarus Community's Western borders."=20<br>
<p>
Meeting in Moscow yesterday, the Executive Committee of the Russia-Belarus<br>
Community tasked the two Defense Ministries with submitting, at the<br>
beginning of 1997, a concept of a "common defense policy." The concept is to<br>
focus on joint decision-making regarding regional security issues, the<br>
creation and use of joint military forces, and employment of the existing<br>
military base infrastructure for these purposes.=20<br>
<p>
In interviews broadcast yesterday in Moscow and in Minsk, Lukashenko claimed<br>
the Western leaders support his parliamentary opponents in order to prevent<br>
unification of Belarus with Russia. For the first time, Lukashenko also<br>
threatened to dissolve the parliament if it continues to resist his demand<br>
for expanded powers. "The people gave me every right to dissolve the<br>
parliament," he claimed, and added that his "hands were untied by the<br>
parliament's violations of the constitution." (Interfax, Belaplan, October=<br>
 17)=20<br>
<p>
Over the weekend Lukashenko will address a self-styled Congress of the<br>
Belarus People, intended as a counterweight to, and potential substitute<br>
for, the parliament. The president's remarks, together with the talks just<br>
held in Moscow on military topics, suggest that -- even as the<br>
constitutional conflict comes to a head in Minsk -- Lukashenko intends to<br>
use the absolute powers he seeks in order to promote a Russia-Belarus<br>
military alliance that would carry far-reaching implications for Belarus'<br>
neighbors.<br>

RUSSIAN OFFICERS TURNING TO CRIME. Russia's chief military prosecutor said<br>
yesterday that crime is growing among Russian military officers and that 100<br>
officers of colonel rank and above--including 15 admirals and generals --<br>
are among those being investigated. According to Col. Gen. Valentin<br>
Panichev, prosecutors have launched legal actions aimed at recovering some<br>
130 billion rubles in embezzled and stolen funds and materials. (Reuter,<br>
October 16)<br>
<p>
GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY URGED. An official from Russia's<br>
Ministry of Defense Industries complained on October 15 that Russian<br>
airlines had purchased only 4 domestically produced aircraft through the<br>
first nine months of this year. The official warned that a number of<br>
aircraft production plants face grave financial difficulties, and urged the<br>
government to provide financial support for the domestic aircraft industry.<br>
(Interfax, October 15) A September decision by Aeroflot to buy 10<br>
Boeing-737's brought to a head resentment among Russian aircraft producers.=<br>

<p>
OMSK DEFENSE WORKERS PROTEST. More than 2,000 workers from defense plants in<br>
the Omsk region picketed the local administration office yesterday,<br>
protesting that they had not been paid for 4-5 months. The local governor,<br>
Leonid Polezhayev, said the economic situation in the region was<br>
"catastrophic" and blamed Moscow. He charged that the central government was<br>
collecting vast amounts of tax revenue in the Omsk region without<br>
contributing a single ruble to the region's budget, something he termed<br>
"undisguised robbery." (Itar-Tass, October 16, 1996)=20<br>
<p>
KAZAKH NAVY GETS CUTTERS FROM GERMANY. The fledgling Kazakh Navy received 4<br>
coastal defense cutters from Germany on Monday. Officially established in<br>
mid-August, the Navy had consisted of 7 small craft from the U.S. and two<br>
made in Kazakhstan. Its main base is at Aktua (formerly Fort Shevchenko) on<br>
the Caspian Sea. (Kazakh TV, October 14 1996)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
CHERNOMYRDIN INTERVENES IN KULIKOV-LEBED FEUD, LEBED APPEALS TO YELTSIN.<br>
Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin held a top-level meeting this<br>
morning to discuss allegations by Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov that<br>
national security chief Aleksandr Lebed has been plotting to seize power in<br>
a coup d'etat. The prime minister dismissed rumors of a planned coup but<br>
said there was "some truth" to Kulikov's other charge -- that Lebed has<br>
bonapartist ambitions and has been mustering a private army. Lebed has<br>
refused to accept Chernomyrdin's judgment and says he will appeal to<br>
President Boris Yeltsin. He and Kulikov are due to submit reports to Yeltsin<br>
later today. (BBC World Service, October 17)<br>
<p>
Kulikov told Russian television yesterday that he had documentary evidence<br>
that Lebed was mustering a secret force of 50,000 troops and plotting<br>
political assassinations with the help of Chechen gunmen. Kulikov said he<br>
had put Interior Ministry troops on heightened alert. Lebed ridiculed the<br>
accusations and called on Yeltsin to choose between himself and Kulikov.<br>
Yeltsin added fuel to the fire: instead of dismissing the allegations, he<br>
asked Kulikov for documentary evidence. Chernomyrdin's reaction was to call<br>
today's apparently inconclusive meeting. (RTR, NTV, Itar-Tass, October 16)<br>
<p>
If Chernomyrdin gets his way, Lebed is likely to lose his Kremlin post. This<br>
would increase Lebed's popularity among the electorate and turn him into a<br>
center of opposition to the Kremlin. It would do little to reduce the power<br>
struggle that has sprung up in the vacuum created by President Yeltsin's<br>
sickness. Observers agree that the latest Kulikov-Lebed clash is based on<br>
something more fundamental than personal rivalry between the two men, and<br>
seems to represent a new phase in a power struggle between rival Kremlin<br>
clans. Lebed's ouster might, however, prevent that struggle from erupting<br>
into armed conflict. Everything seems now to depend on how Yeltsin reacts to<br>
Lebed's appeal. Yeltsin's traditional way of handling subordinates -- divide<br>
and rule -- has only fanned the present conflict and could provoke even more<br>
dangerous consequences, including civil strife, in the future.=20<br>
<p>
KULIKOV'S CHARGES APPARENTLY BASED ON BOTH FACT AND RUMOR. Kulikov's coup<br>
allegations weave together a number of the rumors and conspiracy theories<br>
with which Moscow is always awash. In its latest issue, which reached Moscow<br>
newsstands before Kulikov made his allegations, the well-informed Moscow<br>
News detailed (with some skepticism) reports "from various sources" that<br>
Kulikov had foiled a coup attempt by Lebed during the night of October 2-3.<br>
Lebed was allegedly planning to bring army units into Moscow in order to<br>
take the government and parliament hostage. Lebed intended to force<br>
Chernomyrdin to declare Yeltsin incapable of fulfilling his duties and to<br>
call early presidential elections. Kulikov allegedly foiled the plot by<br>
putting Interior Ministry troops on alert before Lebed could execute his<br>
plan. (Moskovskie novosti, No 41, October 13)=20<br>
<p>
As for Kulikov's charge that Lebed has been mustering a private army,<br>
today's Nezavisimaya gazeta speculates that this allegation is based on the<br>
"Russian legion" that Aleksandr Korzhakov talked about setting up in 1994,<br>
when he was still in charge of Yeltsin's presidential guard. Nezavisimaya<br>
gazeta points out that it published a leaked draft of Korzhakov's national<br>
guard proposals in its December 15, 1994, issue. (Nezavisimaya gazeta,<br>
October 17)<br>
<p>
Lebed's spokesman Alexander Barkhatov denied Kulikov's accusation that his<br>
boss was trying to set up a private army. But Barkhatov offered an<br>
alternative explanation, noting that the Security Council is drafting a<br>
document on the establishment of mobile forces based on Interior and Defense<br>
Ministry troops. That plan is a response to "the problems facing the<br>
Interior Ministry and Kulikov's numerous complaints that he and his ministry<br>
cannot cope with these problems," he said. (Itar-Tass, October 17)<br>
<p>
RUPTURED RELATIONS BETWEEN RUSSIA'S SECURITY CHIEF AND DEFENSE MINISTER?<br>
Among the unexpected consequences of the current wrangle over the future of<br>
Russia's Airborne Forces is the fact that it appears to have driven a wedge<br>
between security chief Aleksandr Lebed and the man he chose to head the<br>
Defense Ministry, Army Gen. Igor Rodionov. Lebed's newfound animosity toward<br>
Rodionov was apparent during an October 15 press conference when the<br>
security chief accused Rodionov of trying to "kill off the [Airborne Forces]<br>
officer corps as quickly as possible." Lebed characterized the relevant<br>
Rodionov directive as "criminal" and declared that it constituted<br>
"malfeasance in office." (NTV, October 15) Lebed also participated in a<br>
meeting of top Airborne Forces commanders on October 15 at which<br>
participants expressed similar bitterness over Rodionov's directive. The<br>
Defense Ministry was not represented at the meeting. (Itar-Tass, October 16.<br>
See Monitor, October 16)<br>
<p>
The seeds of the split between the two men, however, may go back to the<br>
creation of the Russian Defense Council by Boris Yeltsin on July 25.<br>
Although it was difficult even then to see the new agency as anything but a<br>
political counterweight to Lebed's own Security Council, Rodionov seemed to<br>
embrace it with enthusiasm. (Vek, August 2-8; Interfax, August 19)<br>
Developments surrounding the first meeting of the Defense Council, on<br>
October 4, may have aggravated any latent tensions between the two men. On<br>
October 2 Yeltsin named Defense Council secretary Yury Baturin -- and not<br>
Lebed -- to head a commission overseeing appointments to top defense posts.<br>
A series of key military appointments followed, culminating on October 4<br>
with the sacking of six generals and with Rodionov's own promotion to Army<br>
General. The six were said to have opposed Rodionov's plans for<br>
restructuring the army, which was approved at the meeting. Lebed pointedly<br>
boycotted the event, which was presided over by his chief political rival,<br>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and which appeared to reflect a<br>
consolidation of Rodionov's position atop the Defense Ministry bureaucracy.=<br>
=20<br>
<p>
In the days that followed, Lebed's failure to win power over personnel<br>
decisions was seen to have weakened him within the military bureaucracy. At<br>
least one observer also suggested that the maneuverings behind the<br>
consolidation of Rodionov's position in the Defense Ministry had brought<br>
Rodionov closer to Chernomyrdin. (Kommersant-daily, October 9) Several<br>
others, finally, suggested that Lebed had boycotted the October 4 meeting to<br>
avoid association with the painful manpower reductions that he knew would<br>
ensue from it. They also predicted that he would emerge later as the heroic<br>
defender of the abused Russian officer, a prophesy that may be coming to<br>
pass and that can hardly be pleasing to Rodionov, who must carry out the<br>
unpopular reductions. (Segodnya, October 5; Nezavisimaya gazeta, October 8)<br>
<p>
CHECHEN LEADERSHIP SAYS IT WILL SET ELECTION DATE TODAY. While Russia's<br>
leaders exchange threats and insults, Chechen opposition leaders are<br>
pressing ahead with the construction of state institutions in the breakaway<br>
republic. The final touches are being put to a provisional coalition<br>
government, in which Aslan Maskhadov has been named prime minister and<br>
defense minister. Opposition leaders say presidential and parliamentary<br>
elections will be held in January, and that they will announce the precise<br>
election date today. (NTV, October 12) The opposition will put up a single<br>
presidential candidate; the candidates's identity will not be announced<br>
until December, but at present it looks likely that acting president<br>
Zelimkhan Yandarbiev will be nominated.=20<br>
<p>
Moscow officials, taken aback by the news, have objected that January is too<br>
soon for elections and that the Chechen opposition has no right to make<br>
unilateral decisions on such important matters. Moscow says that only the<br>
Joint Commission, on whose creation Lebed and Maskhadov agreed at Khasavyurt<br>
in August, may set the election date. The Russian and Chechen delegations to<br>
the Joint Commission were announced this week, and the new body has been<br>
holding its first meeting in Chechnya yesterday and today. Aleksandr Lebed<br>
is represented by his deputy Sergei Khalamov. (Interfax, October 15) But at<br>
this stage, and given the lack of consensus in Moscow, there seems little<br>
Moscow can do to stop the Chechen leadership from pressing ahead.<br>
<p>
Maskhadov explained the rationale for early elections in a recent interview.<br>
He said speed was essential to prevent an Islamic state being "foisted" on<br>
the Chechens at a time when "people who fought in the name of Allah could be<br>
taken in very easily. This could push us towards fundamentalism." (Tyden<br>
[Prague], September 30) The only non-Chechen who has so far endorsed<br>
Maskhadov's call for early elections is President Ruslan Aushev of<br>
Ingushetia, a Lebed-ally who is well placed to appreciate Maskhadov's sense<br>
of urgency.<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
LUKASHENKO CONSULTS MOSCOW BEFORE EXPECTED SHOWDOWN. Belarus president<br>
Aleksandr Lukashenko conferred yesterday in Moscow with Russian president<br>
Boris Yeltsin, prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, foreign minister Yevgeny<br>
Primakov, and defense minister Igor Rodionov on bilateral relations and the<br>
constitutional conflict in Belarus. The constitutional conflict involves the<br>
referendum that Lukashenko has unilaterally scheduled for November 7 in a<br>
bid for sweeping powers. A showdown in Minsk is believed possible as early<br>
as October 19, when the president will address a Soviet-style "Congress of<br>
the Belarus People" to offset a pro-parliament rally "in defense of the<br>
constitution against dictatorship."=20<br>
<p>
Official Russian statements after yesterday's talks expressed continued<br>
support for Lukashenko's referendum while also advising him to seek "social<br>
peace and stability" and a compromise with the parliament. Lukashenko was<br>
urged to reschedule his referendum to November 24 -- the date set by the<br>
parliament for a referendum on both the presidential and the parliament's<br>
constitutional drafts -- and to give up a ballot proposition designed to<br>
elicit a vote against private land ownership. The talks were also said to<br>
cover common efforts toward unification of national legislations and<br>
economic "integration" issues. Yeltsin, co-chairman with Lukashenko of the<br>
Russia-Belarus Community of States, asked Lukashenko to redouble his<br>
"integrationist" efforts during Yeltsin's illness. Lukashenko was also<br>
received by Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Aleksy II. (Interfax, October=<br>
 16).<br>
<p>
Moscow is clearly interested in Lukashenko's victory and has been organizing<br>
this type of visit for him at regular intervals to enhance his standing<br>
domestically. Yesterday's talks signaled that Moscow continues to rely on<br>
Lukashenko for promoting Russia-Belarus "integration." At the same time<br>
Moscow wants Lukashenko to bring the legislature, or at least a part of it,<br>
on board that policy. However, the concessions recommended to Lukashenko are<br>
too minor to produce any real compromise with the  parliament.<br>
<p>
EUROPE TURNS TO BELARUS. The British, French, German, and Italian<br>
ambassadors to Belarus yesterday handed over to the Foreign Ministry a note<br>
on behalf of the European Union. The EU expressed serious concern over the<br>
president's recent steps escalating the conflict with parliament, urged him<br>
and the government to observe the constitution, and pointed out that the<br>
place of Belarus in Europe depends on the authorities' respect for the rule<br>
of law and democratic processes. It warned that any referendum not approved<br>
by parliament and conducted with less than full openness in the absence of<br>
media freedom would be considered illegitimate and its results invalid.=20<br>
<p>
The chairman of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Leni<br>
Fischer, flew into Minsk yesterday for meetings with parliamentary leaders,<br>
the Constitutional Court, the Central Election Commission, and other<br>
supporters of constitutional rule. Addressing the parliament, Fischer<br>
advised against holding any referendum in the current, tense situation,<br>
warned against attempts to circumvent or dissolve the parliament, and held<br>
the president responsible for the potentially dangerous consequences of<br>
splitting society. Fischer recommended abiding by the existing constitution,<br>
but added that the CE's experts find the parliament's proposed revisions --<br>
which envisage a purely parliamentary republic -- clearly preferable to the<br>
president's draft. The Belarusan parliamentary leaders described the<br>
situation as "volatile and potentially explosive." While appreciative of the<br>
CE's support, they regretted a delay in scheduling a CE debate on Belarus --<br>
now due for November 7 -- and their own visit to the CE, now due in January.<br>
Lukashenko, while still in Moscow, responded at a news conference that "we<br>
are sick of demarches" and said that the EU ambassadors' action was<br>
"incompatible with their diplomatic status."  (Interfax, NTV, October 16)=20<br>
<p>
The CE's and EU's actions are a shot in the arm for a parliament whose<br>
morale had been deteriorating under pressure, and may also sway some<br>
fence-sitters in the executive branch. The intercessions are also long<br>
overdue. The West's attention to Belarus has been episodic, despite the twin<br>
facts that the constitutional crisis there has been brewing for more than a<br>
year and that the international stake in its successful resolution is high.=<br>
=20<br>
<p>
DIVISION OF THE BLACK SEA FLEET STILL A VOLATILE ISSUE. Despite a warning<br>
that President Boris Yeltsin would definitely veto it, the State Duma<br>
yesterday passed a bill directing that the division of the former Soviet<br>
Black Sea fleet between Russia and Ukraine be halted immediately. It's not<br>
the first time the Duma has tried -- unsuccessfully -- to stop the process.<br>
The justifications for the bill were that the 1992 Sochi agreement between<br>
Russia and Ukraine had expired and that the two countries had not agreed on<br>
a comprehensive settlement of the issue as required. The bill called on the<br>
government to stop turning over ships and bases to Ukraine. (Interfax,<br>
October 16 1996)<br>
<p>
That process nevertheless continued. The commanders of the Russian Black Sea<br>
Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy met at the base in Feodosia, on the Crimean<br>
Peninsula, to discuss turning more of that garrison over to Ukraine. As part<br>
of the second stage of the fleet's division, Ukraine would get some 50<br>
warships and support vessels now based at Feodosia. (Rossiiskaya gazeta,<br>
October 16 1996)<br>
<p>
While the admirals were meeting, Ukrainian officials demonstrated their<br>
authority in Feodosia. Ukrainian authorities detained a large landing ship<br>
of the Russian Black Sea Fleet that had carried a "rocket installation" from<br>
the Caucasus about two weeks ago and had used it for test firings at a test<br>
site in Feodosia. The Russian fleet was said to be planning to return the<br>
weapon to Russian forces in the southern Caucasus. The Ukrainian government<br>
had not been consulted in the matter and said the ship would be detained<br>
until all the circumstances surrounding the incident were explained.<br>
(Interfax-Ukraine, 16 October 1996)<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
AZERBAIJANI PARLIAMENT ELECTS NEW SPEAKER. Murtuz Aleskerov was elected<br>
yesterday to the post of chairman of the Milli Majlis, a post which is<br>
second only to that of  president in Azerbaijan=B4s political system.<br>
Aleskerov, 68, is a Moscow-trained professor of law and currently rector of<br>
Baku University. He was a prominent member of the original Popular Front in<br>
1990-91, but left it and in 1992 helped launch the public campaign for the<br>
return of Haidar Aliev from Nakhichevan to Baku. Aleskerov was the sole<br>
candidate for the parliament's chairmanship, but Aliev and the governing<br>
Yeni (New) Azerbaijan party are known to have been actively considering<br>
other possibilities. (Turan, October 16)<br>
<p>
Aleskerov replaces Rasul Guliev, who was forced last month to resign after<br>
urging an acceleration of economic reforms, particularly of privatization.<br>
Aliev and his economists objected to the social costs of Guliev=B4s=<br>
 proposals.<br>

YELTSIN OPERATION TO GO AHEAD IN MID-NOVEMBER. Boris Yeltsin's press<br>
secretary has again denied that the Russian president is too sick to undergo<br>
surgery. Yeltsin's doctor, Sergei Mironov, says the president's anemia is a<br>
source of worry but that he thinks it can be controlled. Mironov said he<br>
expected the operation to take place in the middle of November. (RTR,<br>
October 15; Itar-Tass, October 16)<br>
<p>
DUMA READY TO COMPROMISE ON BUDGET? Russian finance minister Aleksandr<br>
Livshits has welcomed the October 14 recommendation by a Duma working group<br>
that the draft 1997 federal budget be sent back to the government and from<br>
there submitted directly to a joint government/parliament conciliation<br>
commission. Livshits said this should speed up the adoption process. The<br>
alternative -- requiring the government to submit a fresh draft to a plenary<br>
session of parliament -- could have taken much longer, he said. (Interfax,<br>
Kommersant-daily, October 15)<br>
<p>
JAPANESE FISHING BOAT SEIZED. Tokyo has protested the October 12 seizure of<br>
a Japanese fishing boat by Russian border forces. The 10-ton trawler, with a<br>
crew of five men, was fishing in waters off the disputed Kuril Islands. It<br>
was the first seizure of a Japanese boat by Russian forces since September,<br>
1995. The two sides also exchanged accusations following an August 28<br>
incident in which Russian forces fired on two Japanese fishing boats,<br>
wounding one crewman. (Itar-Tass, October 13. See Monitor, August 30)<br>
<p>
MOSCOW STILL HOPES FOR COMPLETION OF CUBAN NUCLEAR PLANT. Following talks in<br>
Moscow yesterday with Venezuelan foreign minister Miguel Angel Burelli<br>
Rivas, Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov reiterated Moscow's<br>
intention to help Cuba complete the Juragua nuclear power plant. The U.S.<br>
has opposed construction of the plant on the grounds that it is a safety<br>
risk. Primakov gave no indication of when the stalled project might be<br>
completed. (AP, Interfax, October 14)<br>
<p>
FIGURES ON RUSSIA'S NUCLEAR WASTE. Russia has accumulated 650 million cubic<br>
meters of radioactive waste, Deputy Atomic Energy Minister Nikolai Yegorov<br>
told a Moscow conference on Tuesday. The Navy and the Mayak nuclear weapons<br>
plant in Chelyabinsk are the main sources. While 90 billion rubles have been<br>
earmarked for research projects this year to find ways to process and store<br>
this waste, only 21.8 billion has so far been released, he said. (Interfax,<br>

<p>
KULIKOV AND LEBED CLASH AGAIN. Closed hearings on Chechnya were held<br>
yesterday by a joint session of the two houses of the Russian parliament.<br>
Alarmed by the open feuding in his government, President Yeltsin ordered<br>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, National Security Adviser Aleksandr<br>
Lebed, and Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov to reconcile their positions<br>
beforehand. Lebed and Kulikov clashed again during the hearings but not,<br>
according to those present, as fiercely as on earlier occasions. (NTV,<br>
Interfax October 15) Nonetheless, Kulikov continued to insist that the<br>
Khasavyurt accords were a capitulation by Russia to the Chechen opposition.<br>
Lebed countered with the charge that the accords would not have been<br>
necessary had Grozny not fallen to the opposition in August, for which he<br>
blamed Kulikov himself; Kulikov's deputy, Gen. Pavel Golubets; acting<br>
commander of the federal forces in Chechnya, Gen. Konstantin Pulikovsky;<br>
pro-Moscow Chechen leader Doku Zavgaev; and Zavgaev's prime minister,<br>
Nikolai Koshman. Lebed said he had received documentary evidence to back his<br>
charges from Chechen chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov. (NTV, Interfax October=<br>
 15)<br>
<p>
MOSCOW PINS ITS HOPES ON ECONOMIC AGREEMENT. Nothing was decided at<br>
yesterday's parliamentary hearings. But Lebed waved around pages of a draft<br>
law on establishing a free economic zone in Chechnya. This proposal,<br>
believed to be the brainchild of Sergei Shakhrai, is being seen as a<br>
possible compromise that might allow Russian and Chechnya to avoid political<br>
issues and build a workable relationship on economic grounds. Shakhrai told<br>
journalists yesterday that the idea was based on the time-honored principle<br>
of "accepting what can't be changed, changing what can be changed, and<br>
knowing one from the other." Shakhrai said that, whether Moscow likes it or<br>
not, a free economic zone will spring up spontaneously in Chechnya as soon<br>
as federal troops are withdrawn. This zone will be dominated by criminal<br>
groups and will be outside the reach of Russian law enforcement, he said.<br>
Taxes will not be collected because collecting them will be beyond anyone's<br>
power. It is therefore pointless for Russia even to try to include Chechnya<br>
within its tax structure. Nor will Moscow be able to close down the zone by<br>
either law or force. Shakhrai advised the Russian government to tell Chechen<br>
leaders that Moscow will not try to collect taxes from Chechnya, but at the<br>
same time will not invest money in rebuilding the republic's economy. Russia<br>
should establish barriers along the Chechen border, Shakhrai continued,<br>
because while these would not cut Chechnya off from trade with Russia, they<br>
would serve to levy duty. Whatever profit accrued within the republic would<br>
belong to the republic and could be spent on reconstruction. The hope would<br>
be that gradually the laws of the market would begin to replace those of the<br>
underworld. Shakhrai argued that while this was a long shot, it was the only<br>
realistic option open to Moscow in the circumstances. (ORT, October 15;<br>
Nezavisimaya gazeta, October 16)<br>
<p>
AN OLD PARATROOPER DEFENDS HIS SERVICE. Like the old paratrooper he is,<br>
Security Council Secretary Aleksandr Lebed is boiling mad at what he sees as<br>
a plot to do away with the airborne troops. Yesterday he blasted a recent<br>
order from Defense Minister Igor Rodionov to disband 2 of Russia's remaining<br>
5 airborne divisions by the middle of December as "a criminal document in<br>
terms of its contents, preparation, required implementation and<br>
consequences."(Interfax, October 15 1996) Lebed also warned that the<br>
decision could ignite a social explosion and further inflame resentment<br>
within the armed forces. He announced his intention to meet with Boris<br>
Yeltsin on the subject. (Interfax, October 15)<br>
<p>
Lebed tied Rodionov's order to an earlier one from former defense minister<br>
Pavel Grachev that turned over two paratrooper divisions and 4 independent<br>
airborne brigades to the control of the military district commanders where<br>
they were based. When Grachev issued this order last December there were<br>
also dire predictions that the airborne troops were doomed. Lebed claimed<br>
that these latest two measures would bring the strength of the airborne<br>
forces down from 64,300 to 48,500. In fact, however, this lower figure is<br>
probably an accurate reflection of the size of the force today.=20<br>
<p>
It was Duma Deputy Lebed who rushed to the defense of the airborne troops in<br>
January after Grachev's resubordination order, and the retired general is<br>
using the same argument this time around: that the airborne troops are being<br>
"squandered" and that an earlier Yeltsin decree on the formation of mobile<br>
forces -- based on the airborne troops -- is being abandoned (Interfax,<br>
January 21 1996). "The geo-strategic situation, international and<br>
military-technological trends, i.e., all parameters of the development of<br>
Russia and the world community, require that such a new tactical-strategic<br>
unit as mobile forces be created in Russia." American mobile forces are<br>
based on the Marines Corps, but Russia's must be based on the airborne<br>
troops, the former commander of the 106th Guards Airborne Division said.=20<br>
<p>
Meanwhile, leaders of the Airborne forces under acting commander Col. Gen.<br>
Aleksandr Chindarov met yesterday to discuss the disbandment directive. They<br>
indicated their intention to make a counterproposal that calls for<br>
preserving all five of Russia's current airborne divisions while eliminating<br>
from each of them one of its four constituent regiments. (Nezavisimaya<br>
gazeta, October 15) Finally, a regiment attached to the 76th Airborne<br>
Division, based in Pskov, apparently also faces the ax. According to a<br>
Russian report, the head of Pskov's regional administration sent an appeal<br>
yesterday to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Rodionov asking that<br>
they reconsider plans to eliminate the 237th air assault regiment. The<br>
appeal warned dramatically that the disbandment of the regiment could<br>
compromise Pskov's security at a time when NATO is preparing its expansion<br>
to Russia's borders. It also suggested that the decision might provoke<br>
public protests. (Interfax, October 15)=20<br>
<p>
THE CHANGES MOSCOW WANTS IN START II. U.S. secretary of defense William<br>
Perry is unlikely to find too many sympathetic faces when he urges members<br>
of several Duma committees this week to ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction<br>
Treaty II (START II). With NATO expansion into Eastern Europe imminent,<br>
Russian conventional military power at an all time low, and with the U.S.<br>
seemingly ready to abandon the ABM treaty and create an SDI-like nation-wide<br>
ballistic missile defense, few support what is generally conceded to be a<br>
treaty more advantageous to the U.S. than to Russia. To top it off, treaty<br>
implementation would be a costly prospect for Russia.=20<br>
<p>
In the parliamentary debates on ratification, the views of the Ministry of<br>
Defense and the General Staff will be important. Former defense minister<br>
Pavel Grachev at least paid lip service to the treaty. His successor, Igor<br>
Rodionov, is rumored to be a staunch opponent (Segodnya, July 18).<br>
Yesterday, an unidentified source in the ministry said that the ministry<br>
would support ratification of an "adjusted version" of the treaty, one with<br>
adjustments to "both quantitative and qualitative parameters=85." (Interfax,<br>
October 15 1996) What might these changes be?<br>
<p>
The Russians have felt that the present treaty favors submarine-based<br>
forces, an area where they see American superiority. The treaty now mandates<br>
a total of 3,000 - 3,500 strategic warheads for each party by the end of the<br>
7-year reduction period, of which no more than 1,700 - 1,750 can be<br>
submarine-based. Moscow is likely to want these latter figures lowered, with<br>
tighter restrictions on the rules governing "downloading" -- the removal of<br>
some of the warheads from a multi-warhead weapon -- in order to eliminate a<br>
perceived U.S. advantage in quickly putting back the downloaded warheads.<br>
They are also likely to want restrictions on conventional sea-launched<br>
cruise missiles (SLCMs), suspecting that the Americans could rather easily<br>
replace conventional explosives with nuclear ones.<br>
<p>
Possessing a large land-based intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)<br>
force that will not be prohibitively expensive to maintain, the Russians<br>
will probably push for a larger role for this force. This might lead them to<br>
propose dropping the treaty's ultimate ban on all multiple-warhead ICBMs or<br>
multiple independently-targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs). Short of that,<br>
they might want to be allowed to convert a greater number of their present<br>
MIRVed ICBMs to single-warhead weapons than the treaty now permits. One<br>
measure that would make the present START II treaty more palatable to most<br>
Russians would be a U.S. commitment to a follow-on START III with<br>
significantly lower limits -- in the range of 2,000 to 1,500, or even as low<br>
as 1,000, total warheads. (Itar-Tass, September 17 1996)=20<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR, MILITARY REPRESENTATIVES ENCOURAGE TRANSDNIESTER'S<br>
INTRANSIGENCE. Russian ambassador Aleksandr Papkin yesterday urged Moldova<br>
promptly to sign the Memorandum on the principles of settling the<br>
Transdniester conflict, initialed by President Mircea Snegur and<br>
Transdniester leader Igor Smirnov last June but repudiated afterward by<br>
Snegur. Failure to sign the Memorandum, together with claims that "it<br>
impairs somebody's this or that," only reflect "either incompetence or bad<br>
faith," Papkin said in an interview with the governing Agrarian Democratic<br>
party's newspaper. The ambassador, who is also a mediator in the<br>
Chisinau-Tiraspol talks, reaffirmed that Russia stands for "a maximal level<br>
of Transdniester autonomy, taking into account the existing realities and<br>
the interests of the Transdniester's population, in the framework of<br>
Moldova's sovereignty and territorial integrity." (Interfax, October 15)=20<br>
<p>
It is Snegur who said after repudiating the Memorandum that it "impairs<br>
Moldova's sovereignty and territorial integrity." Snegur initialed the<br>
document on June 28, yielding as on other occasions to pressure from Russian<br>
president Boris Yeltsin. Eager for a "peacemaking" coup between the two<br>
rounds of the Russian presidential election, Yeltsin scheduled the signing<br>
ceremony for July 3 in the Kremlin. However, the Kremlin itself postponed<br>
the signing on the grounds that Yeltsin's campaign schedule could not<br>
accommodate it. More likely, Yeltsin's medical condition was the reason. Let<br>
off the hook by Moscow, and pressured by some of his political allies in the<br>
Moldovan presidential contest, Snegur went on to announce that he disagreed<br>
with the Memorandum's terms. The reference by Papkin to the interests of<br>
Transdniester's population implies a Russian voice in defining and<br>
arbitrating the interests of the region's non-Russians, who comprise three<br>
quarters of its population. Most recently, the local Russian authorities<br>
have closed Moldovan schools and arrested Moldovan teachers in order to<br>
prevent the use of the Latin script by the native Moldovan population.<br>
Papkin's reference to "existing realities" implies acceptance of<br>
Transdniester's claim to virtual statehood, potentially including its own<br>
existing army.<br>
<p>
Yesterday, the Russian and Transdniester sides in the tripartite armistice<br>
control commission vetoed the Moldovan side's proposal to allow the local<br>
OSCE mission to inspect Transdniester military sites in the city of Bendery,<br>
suspected of producing and storing Grad missiles. The step is only the<br>
latest in the series of vetoes designed to protect Transdniester military<br>
facilities unlawfully situated in the demilitarized zone. (Basapress, Flux,<br>
October 15)<br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN-TURKMEN DIFFERENCES PERSIST. Turkmen president Saparmurad Niazov and<br>
Russian leaders attempted to resolve extant differences during Niazov's<br>
"working visit" to Moscow on October 14 and 15. A Turkmen official told The<br>
Monitor that Niazov's meeting with Russian president Boris Yeltsin in the<br>
Barvikha sanatorium was a mere courtesy call to a sick man and that no real<br>
discussions took place there. The hard issues were thrashed out in Niazov's<br>
talks with Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and foreign minister<br>
Yevgeny Primakov. According to Russian official statements, the Turkmen<br>
position on the legal status of the Caspian Sea "coincided" with Russia's in<br>
opposing sectoral partition and favoring common use of mineral resources.<br>
The sides agreed to encourage the participation of Russian companies in<br>
developing oil and gas deposits "near Turkmenistan's shore," in the Russian<br>
Foreign Ministry's phrasing, which carefully avoided the term "sector."=20<br>
<p>
The delegations openly disagreed on the repayment of Russia's $ 500 million<br>
debt for Turkmen gas deliveries -- Moscow claimed that the debt is owed to<br>
the Turkmen-Russian company Turkmenrosgaz, not to Turkmenistan itself. They<br>
also disagreed on the price of further deliveries of Turkmen gas to Russia<br>
through the joint company. Russia's Gazprom has a 45 percent stake in<br>
Turkmenrosgaz; Turkmenistan's is 55 percent.<br>
<p>
Russian official statements on these talks also suggest that Moscow made its<br>
agreement to the proposed Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan gas pipeline<br>
conditional on a prior political settlement of the Afghan conflict.<br>
<p>
At his news conference in Moscow, Niazov did not confirm the alleged change<br>
of his position on the Caspian Sea's status. He also indicated that he had<br>
maintained his special position on Afghanistan, based on Turkmenistan's<br>
neutral status and the CIS member countries' right to take "different points<br>
of view on any issue." Niazov said that Turkmenistan "does not fully share"<br>
the conclusions of the recent Russian-Central Asian summit in Almaty, which<br>
it declined to attend; that it "enjoys good relations with all Afghan<br>
groupings including the Taliban," and that it considers the inter-Afghan<br>
conflict as a purely internal affair of that country. Niazov favored<br>
UN-sponsored inter-Afghan talks, but not the international conference of<br>
"interested countries" proposed by Moscow. (Interfax, Itar-Tass, October 14<br>
and 15)<br>
<p>
Niazov is unlikely to have endorsed Moscow's position on the status of the<br>
Caspian Sea. Although not openly supporting Azerbaijan's and Kazakhstan's<br>
stand for sectoral partition, Turkmenistan has embraced it in practice by<br>
making agreements with international companies based upon national control<br>
of mineral deposits on its continental shelf, without asking for Moscow's<br>
consent.=20<br>
<p>
The planned trans-Afghan pipeline would give Turkmenistan and, potentially,<br>
Kazakhstan the major outlet they seek to international markets, bypassing<br>
Russia. The pipeline's Afghan stretch would cross territory controlled by<br>
Taliban, which supports the project. Pakistan -- the Taliban's main regional<br>
backer and the pipeline's destination country -- also favors it. Last week,<br>
Niazov discussed the project with a senior Pakistani delegation in Ashgabat<br>
and also endorsed Pakistan's objections to any external attempts at<br>
reversing the Taliban's recent successes. The leaders of the $4 billion<br>
pipeline project,  UNOCAL of the U.S. and Delta of Saudi Arabia, are<br>
discussing possible participation by Gazprom as a way of getting Russia on<br>
board. However, Gazprom and the Russian government behind it may well view<br>
such discussions as an opportunity to stall the project.=20<br>
<p>
CORRECTION: Yesterday's Monitor incorrectly identified Russia's Federal<br>
Border Service (FBS) as the FSB.=20<br>

<p>
SLOW PROGRESS ON RUSSIA'S APPLICATION TO JOIN WTO. Negotiations resumed in<br>
Geneva today over Russia's application to join the World Trade Organization.<br>
Progress has been slow since Moscow first applied to join the organization<br>
in June 1993. Russia wants to improve its access to world markets, but many<br>
member-states are wary since they feel Russia has not yet sufficiently<br>
reformed its trading practices. (BBC World Service, October 15)<br>
<p>
CHUBAIS TO TACKLE COURT REFORM. President Yeltsin's chief-of-staff, Anatoly<br>
Chubais, says the president is concerned about the problems of Russia's<br>
judicial system and has ordered his administration to find ways to resolve<br>
them. (Interfax, October 9) Several local courts have warned they will be<br>
soon forced by lack of funds to cease operations.<br>
<p>
U.S. DELEGATION TO MOSCOW. A U.S. delegation headed by Defense Secretary<br>
William Perry departs Washington today for three days of talks with Russian<br>
leaders. The highlight is Perry's appearance before the Russian Duma on<br>
October 17, when he will urge ratification of the START II Treaty. The<br>
delegation also includes Senators Sam Nunn, Richard Lugar, and Joseph<br>
Lieberman. Nunn and Lugar sponsored the legislation providing aid for Russia<br>
to help finance nuclear arms cuts. (Reuter, October 14)<br>
<p>
GAS CUT OFF TO NUCLEAR SUB BASE. The local gas company has shut the valve to<br>
one of the Northern Fleet's largest nuclear submarine bases. Murmanskoblgaz<br>
said the gas would be cut off to the base in Zaozyorsk until the end of the<br>
year unless the base paid its bill of 3 billion rubles. Last September, the<br>
government banned power companies from similar actions after the commander<br>
of the Northern Fleet was forced to send troops into the power plants to<br>
restore power. (Interfax, October 13 1996) <br>
<p>
TALBOTT REASSURES UKRAINE OVER LEBED CLAIM TO SEVASTOPOL. U.S. deputy<br>
secretary of state Strobe Talbott yesterday assured a U.S.-Ukrainian<br>
conference in Washington that Russian security chief Aleksandr Lebed's<br>
statements claiming Sevastopol for Russia do not represent the official<br>
position of the Russian government, that Moscow recognizes that Crimea<br>
belongs to Ukraine, and that the U.S. supports Ukraine's territorial<br>
integrity within its existing borders. (Interfax-Ukraine, October 14. See<br>
Monitor, October 14, and Perspective section below)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
YELTSIN MAKES LEBED TOP CHECHNYA NEGOTIATOR. President Yeltsin has appointed<br>
security chief Aleksandr Lebed to head a new 17-member commission that will<br>
continue peace negotiations with the Chechen opposition. (Interfax,<br>
Itar-Tass, Reuters, October 14) The new commission will include government<br>
officials and the heads of the Russian regions that neighbor Chechnya. The<br>
appointment is a sign of continuing presidential support for Lebed's peace<br>
efforts, despite fierce criticism from other Moscow leaders. Today, Lebed is<br>
to give an account of the situation in Chechnya at a closed session of the<br>
Russian Duma. <br>
<p>
CHECHEN LEADERS PROPOSE ECONOMIC TREATY WITH RUSSIA. Chechen opposition<br>
leaders say they would be willing to sign an economic agreement with Russia,<br>
as long as it contained no mention of Chechnya as a subject of the Russian<br>
Federation. (Interfax, October 13) Ruslan Chimaev, foreign minister in the<br>
Chechen opposition government, told Interfax that such an agreement should<br>
cover customs tariffs, banking connections, transport links, and energy<br>
supplies. He noted that, at least as far as energy is concerned, Chechnya<br>
has no interest in cutting itself off from Russia. As for the proposals that<br>
have appeared in the Russian press for a free economic zone in Chechnya ("a<br>
kind of Russian Hong Kong"), Chimaev said this could be only a temporary<br>
solution, pending a final decision on the status of the republic. (According<br>
to the Khasavyurt accords, Chechnya's status would be put on hold for five<br>
years, but should be decided by the end of 2001.) Chimaev said the proposed<br>
treaty should cover the rebuilding of Chechnya's war-devastated economy --<br>
indicating that Chechnya expects to receive money for this from Moscow --<br>
though he warned that Moscow should not expect Chechnya to agree to pay any<br>
kind of taxes to Moscow. What Chechnya has in mind, Chimaev said, is the<br>
kind of treaty Russia would sign with Belarus, Ukraine, or Kazakhstan.<br>
Russia's 1994 treaty with Tatarstan would not, therefore, be an acceptable<br>
model. While tactfully making no mention of Tatarstan as a subject of the<br>
Russian Federation, it specifically acknowledged the Russian Constitution. <br>
<p>
DAGESTAN MOVES ONTO LEBED'S AGENDA. Security Council secretary Aleksandr<br>
Lebed met yesterday with Dagestan's leader, Magomedali Magomedov. According<br>
to the official statement that followed the meeting, the two men discussed<br>
the situation in Chechnya, including plans to build a railroad through<br>
Dagestan bypassing Chechnya. (Interfax, October 14) Work on the 80 km<br>
railroad is to start at the end of this year and is due to be completed in<br>
1999. Prior to the meeting, the chairman of Dagestan's parliament, Mukhu<br>
Aliev, told the Monitor that Magomedov would also inform Lebed about the<br>
situation in Dagestan where, Aliev warned, separatist sentiment and the<br>
activity of criminal gangs are both on the rise. "The Kremlin may have<br>
settled the Chechen crisis," Aliev said, "but for us the problems have only<br>
just begun." <br>
<p>
Complaining about cross-border raids from Chechnya into Dagestan, Aliev said<br>
Magomedov would ask Lebed to tighten border security. At present, he said,<br>
federal troops "are only thinking about going home." The Dagestani<br>
authorities may be trying to exploit the situation in Chechnya to wring more<br>
money out of Moscow. Eighty-five percent of Dagestan's budget comes from<br>
federal subsidies. "Russia has spent a sum equivalent to five times our<br>
republic's annual budget on the reconstruction of Chechnya, while we haven't<br>
gotten even a third of the money that's coming to us. If Russia continues to<br>
withhold this money, it will be very hard for us to prevent a social<br>
explosion," Aliev told the Monitor.<br>
<p>
ROBBING PYOTR TO PAY PAVEL. The good news for Russia's military personnel is<br>
that the government has promised to pay most of their back wages by the end<br>
of the year. The bad news for the Defense Ministry is that it will have to<br>
pay for this largesse from other programs. Finance Minister Aleksandr<br>
Livshits, also a deputy prime minister, said on Saturday that July wages<br>
would be cleared up by the end of this month while in November and December<br>
the government would pay the debt for August along with the normal wages for<br>
those months. However, he said that these payments would be made "at the<br>
expense of other parts of the defense budget." Livshits admitted that the<br>
government would still owe the troops their September wages as well as a<br>
year-end lump-sum bonus of 3 month's pay. These debts would be cleared up<br>
during the first quarter of next year, he promised. (Itar-Tass, October 12 1996)<br>
<p>
Not getting paid has been one of the most humiliating and demoralizing<br>
aspects of recent military service, forcing officers to drive taxis and take<br>
other illegal moonlighting jobs to feed and house their families. But while<br>
Defense Minister Igor Rodionov certainly will applaud the fact that his<br>
personnel will finally get paid, he must be shuddering at the thought of<br>
finding the money to pay this new bill. Military officials have repeatedly<br>
cited a whole litany of financial shortfalls in the budget. Not only is<br>
there no fat in these budgets, they argue, little of the muscle is left. <br>
<p>
President Boris Yeltsin has directed his government to solve the military's<br>
financial problems. The first plan mooted calls for a 2 percent special<br>
increase in the value-added tax (VAT), which is predicted to raise some 25<br>
trillion rubles for the military in 2 years. This Defense Ministry idea<br>
reportedly caught the Finance Ministry and the State Taxation Service by<br>
surprise (Segodnya, October 11 1996.) With tax evasion a Russian art form,<br>
the VAT currently provides 40 percent of the government's tax revenues. And<br>
these revenues repeatedly fall far short of the government's estimates.<br>
(Delovoi mir, October 11-17 1996.) However, it is becoming clear to everyone<br>
that something extraordinary must be done. Livshits said the decision on a<br>
special tax for the armed forces was likely to be "very hard," but Rodionov<br>
would surely say such hard decisions are long overdue. <br>
<p>
PLEADING POVERTY: BORDER FORCES STAKE THEIR CLAIM. But Russia's regular army<br>
is not the only military force demanding funds. Less than a month after the<br>
Defense Ministry produced figures demonstrating that it was the worst<br>
financed of Russia's "power ministries" (see Monitor, September 19), the<br>
country's Federal Border Service (FBS) on October 12 tried to claim that<br>
honor for itself. According to border forces director Andrei Nikolayev, the<br>
FSB has in 1996 received only 19 percent of the funding it requires for<br>
normal functioning, and only 51 percent of the funding actually earmarked<br>
for it in the federal budget. "Other power structures are in a better<br>
position," Nikolayev said, "including the Defense Ministry, which has<br>
received 54 percent of its funding, and the Interior Ministry, with 62<br>
percent." The FSB has received no money for the purchase of food in August<br>
and September, Nikolayev added, and has been reduced to logging wood,<br>
hunting, and fishing to support itself. (Itar-Tass, October 12)<br>
<p>
Nikolayev's remarks come amid a bruising debate over Russia's 1997 state<br>
budget. They follow a series of accusations by top military leaders --<br>
including Defense Minister Igor Rodionov and Security Council secretary<br>
Aleksandr Lebed -- alleging that Russia's regular military forces are being<br>
slowly starved to death by the favoritism shown to the country's other<br>
"power structures" in the dispensation of state funds. In examining this<br>
issue, one Russian newspaper recently quoted defense experts as estimating<br>
that there are now more than 2 million troops serving in some twenty<br>
agencies not subordinated to the Defense Ministry; the regular army itself<br>
is believed to have less than 1.7 million soldiers. According to the same<br>
report, these non-Defense Ministry agencies also have access to considerable<br>
secret funding and -- thanks to shrewd Kremlin politicking -- have managed<br>
to avoid the reductions and restructuring that have been foisted upon the<br>
regular army. The report suggested that the October 4 meeting of Russia's<br>
Defense Council did little to change that situation. (Obshchaya gazeta,<br>
October 10-16. See Monitor, October 7)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
INFLUENTIAL U.S.-UKRAINE GROUP BACKS KIEV'S WESTERN COURSE. The<br>
U.S.-Ukrainian Consultative Committee, which includes Zbigniew Brzezinski,<br>
George Soros, and top Ukrainian officials, convened on October 11 in Kiev to<br>
review the development of Ukraine's internal reforms and its relations with<br>
the West. The Committee made a number of recommendations. They included an<br>
intensification of Ukrainian economic reforms and of Western support for<br>
those reforms, more active Ukrainian participation in the processes<br>
connected with NATO's enlargement, the urgent opening of a NATO information<br>
center in Kiev, practical steps by both sides to turn the concept of<br>
"special relationship" with NATO into a reality, and support for Ukraine's<br>
effort to become, in effect, a part of Central Europe. Participants observed<br>
that an independent and secure Ukraine offers Russia an opportunity to<br>
become a "normal, non-imperial state," and thus the chance to achieve<br>
prosperity for the first time in its history. A group of retired U.S.<br>
officers accompanied the U.S. delegation and discussed military issues with<br>
Defense Minister Aleksandr Kuzmuk. It was noted in that discussion that<br>
Ukraine's non-bloc status leaves Kiev free to develop bilateral ties with<br>
any country it chooses. (Interfax-Ukraine, October 11 through 14 )<br>
<p>
The Committee is a non-governmental organization, although its Ukrainian<br>
participants include cabinet ministers, presidential aides, senior<br>
diplomats, as well as former president Leonid Kravchuk and former prime<br>
minister Yevhen Marchuk. Founded in 1994, the Committee meets twice annually<br>
and works out policy recommendations that carry weight with both<br>
governments. Last month the U.S. and Ukraine set up an intergovernmental<br>
commission, co-chaired by Vice President Al Gore and President Leonid<br>
Kuchma, to intensify bilateral relations.<br>
<p>
BELARUS PARLIAMENT UNCERTAINLY STANDS ITS GROUND. By 88 votes to 84, the<br>
Belarus parliament has turned down president Aleksandr Lukashenko's October<br>
10 proposals. They had envisaged parliamentary endorsement of Lukashenko's<br>
dictatorial constitutional draft and its joint submission to a referendum on<br>
November 7, in return for a guarantee of seats to virtually all deputies in<br>
an emasculated new parliament. Addressing the deputies before the vote,<br>
however, Lukashenko failed to restate that promise. He also sharply attacked<br>
his opponents and demanded, ultimatum-like, a final parliamentary decision<br>
by October 18. If parliament failed to meet that deadline, Lukashenko<br>
warned, he would have his draft endorsed by a "Belarus people's congress" --<br>
scheduled to convene on October 19 -- and would then conduct the referendum<br>
unilaterally. <br>
<p>
Constitutional Court chairman Valery Tsikhinya ultimately swayed the chamber<br>
with warnings that Lukashenko's draft constitution would establish "a<br>
totalitarian state in the center of Europe...totally isolating Belarus<br>
internationally." Immediately after the vote Lukashenko announced that he<br>
was withdrawing his "compromise" and stormed out of the chamber. (Belaplan,<br>
Interfax, October 10 through 13)<br>
<p>
Lukashenko had recently collected the signatures of 110 out of the 199<br>
deputies for his proposal, but his confrontational appearance in parliament<br>
on the decisive day clearly cost him some support. The parliament may now<br>
theoretically go ahead with its own constitutional referendum, scheduled to<br>
take place on November 24 along with parliamentary by-elections. Under the<br>
existing constitution and legislation, only the parliament is empowered to<br>
call a referendum and only the Central Election Commission may administer<br>
it. But Lukashenko and his finance ministry are unlawfully withholding the<br>
funds for the November 24 referendum and by-elections, while financing the<br>
president's planned November 7 referendum and directing local executive<br>
bodies to administer it.<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
FALLOUT CONTINUES FROM ARMENIA'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. In a report on<br>
Armenia's September 22 presidential election, the U.S.-based International<br>
Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) concluded that "the electoral<br>
process broke down as the vote count started." The report, entitled "Flawed<br>
Election in Armenia," pointed to transparency violations, police<br>
interference, threats to candidates' representatives, pre-signed and<br>
pre-stamped tally sheets, and vote-counting discrepancies. IFES noted that<br>
"the electoral law was compromised before, during, and after election day."<br>
It also called for "further investigation and international scrutiny," as<br>
well as a prompt review by Armenia's authorities themselves, lest they "cast<br>
permanent doubt" on the election. <br>
<p>
Amnesty International, the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch - Helsinki, the<br>
Moscow-based Memorial Human Rights Center, and a group of Russian democratic<br>
deputies -- including prominent Armenia sympathizer Galina Starovoytova --<br>
have all issued open letters to reelected president Levon Ter-Petrosian,<br>
urging him to end arbitrary arrests and violence and to restore due process<br>
of law and political freedoms. Concurrently, a commission of the European<br>
Union has postponed a scheduled visit to Armenia for trade negotiations,<br>
while a delegation of the Council of Europe did visit in order to gather<br>
information about those arrested. The CE delegation also expressed concern<br>
about the government's "step back from democracy" in its repression of the<br>
opposition following violent protests over electoral fraud on September 25.<br>
<p>
The government is slowly moving to relax the repression. It has released<br>
some prominent political figures from arrest, and the president has<br>
rescinded his September 26 decree which banned rallies and demonstrations.<br>
(Noyan-Tapan, Interfax, Western agencies, October 11 through 14) However,<br>
opposition parties are far from free to operate, and unsubstantiated<br>
criminal indictments are pending against some opposition leaders. With local<br>
elections scheduled for November 11, the stage may be set for another<br>
controversial electoral exercise. <br>
<p>
SHEVARDNADZE REBUKES UN ENVOY. Georgian president Eduard Shevardnadze told<br>
the country on radio yesterday that UN special envoy "Edouard Brunner's<br>
episodic visits do not contribute to the settlement of the Georgian-Abkhaz<br>
conflict." (Interfax, October 13) Brunner last week publicly endorsed the<br>
Russian and Abkhaz positions against Georgia's (see Monitor, October 11) and<br>
also diverged from the positions of international organizations on the<br>
Abkhaz elections planned for next month. While the OSCE and other<br>
organizations have decided against monitoring those elections in order to<br>
avoid the appearance of legitimizing them, Brunner encouraged the Abkhaz<br>
leaders in Sukhumi to hold the election and to ensure an open exercise in<br>
order to gain international recognition. <br>
<p>
The UN envoy also announced that Georgia's proposal to include the U.S.,<br>
Britain, Germany, and France alongside Russia in the conflict settlement<br>
talks was being rejected by the Abkhaz side. (Radio Sukhumi, Iberia, October<br>
11 and 12). Moscow is in effect hiding behind the Abkhaz in parrying that<br>
proposal, while the UN secretary general and his envoy continue to express<br>
no opinion despite their responsibility as a party to the talks.<br>

LATVIA'S GUESTS ABUSE HOSPITALITY. Hundreds of Russian war veterans held an<br>
unauthorized rally in central Riga yesterday to mark the anniversary of the<br>
1944 Soviet "liberation" of the Latvian capital. Participants called for the<br>
restoration of the USSR and the release of Baltic Communist leaders<br>
sentenced for their participation in the 1991 Soviet crackdown and putsch.<br>
(Itar-Tass, Interfax, October 13) The Baltic states have been under pressure<br>
to accept thousands of Soviet Army veterans as permanent residents and even<br>
to co-finance their social benefits, rather than having them repatriated to<br>
Russia.<br>
<p>
OFFICERS FLEEING THE FLEET? According to a Russian television report,<br>
Russia's Pacific Fleet faces a potentially debilitating loss of officers<br>
next year, when the contracts for many of them come up for renewal. Of some<br>
600 officers, 70 percent reportedly do not intend to extend their term of<br>
service, and 182 have already filed for demobilization. (Russian TV, October<br>
11) <br>
<p>
BELLONA REPS BARRED FROM ST. PETERSBURG. On orders from Russia's Foreign<br>
Ministry, two representatives of the Oslo-based environmental organization<br>
Bellona have been denied visas to visit St. Petersburg, the group announced<br>
on October 10. The representatives reportedly had intended to bring<br>
information needed for the defense of Aleksandr Nikitin, the retired Russian<br>
naval officer charged with treason for work done in collaboration with<br>
Bellona. Norway's Foreign Ministry is expected to raise the issue with<br>
Moscow. (Bellona press release, October 10)<br>
<p>
KUZYUK: "ELITE" ARMS COMPANIES TO GROW INTO TRANSNATIONAL GIANTS. Boris<br>
Kuzyk, President Boris Yeltsin's advisor on arms cooperation with foreign<br>
countries, said yesterday that several of Russia's successful arms combines<br>
would grow into transnational corporations. He said serious proposals had<br>
already been received from prospective partners in Belarus, Ukraine, and<br>
Kazakhstan. Kuzyk pointed to the Moscow Aircraft Production Association<br>
(MAPO) and the St. Petersburg Morskaya Tekhnika financial-industrial group<br>
as examples. (Interfax October 12, 13 1996)<br>
<p>
YEMANIS WANT HIDE OF RUSSIAN ARMS DEALER. A Russian arms dealer has been<br>
holed up in the Russian consulate in Aden for 4 months after Yemen demanded<br>
his arrest for failing to deliver $4 million worth of arms it had ordered<br>
and paid for. Sergei Spassky had headed a company called Bonex when he made<br>
the deal with Yemen in 1994. Now vice-president of another company, he made<br>
the mistake of returning to Aden in May. (Reuters, 12 October 1996)<br>
<p>
SOUTH KOREA SHOWS INTEREST IN RUSSIAN JET. The commander of the South Korean<br>
Air Force told a group of visiting Russian parliamentarians that his service<br>
would consider the Russian-built Su-35 fighter along with U.S. and West<br>
European planes when it upgrades its fleet. Gen. Lee Kwang Hak added that<br>
the new acquisitions would not begin until 2002. (ITAR-TASS, October 9 1996)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
LEBED SAYS HE'S SUPPORTING KORZHAKOV. Russian security chief Aleksandr Lebed<br>
says he will support former Presidential Security Service head Aleksandr<br>
Korzhakov in his bid for the parliamentary seat Lebed gave up when he moved<br>
to the Kremlin in June. (NTV, October 13) A by-election for the Tula<br>
constituency will be held next February. Lebed and Korzhakov were in Tula --<br>
a major center of defense production south of Moscow -- for celebrations<br>
marking the city's 850th anniversary. There had been rumors that Lebed would<br>
strike a deal with Korzhakov, who lost his post as Yeltsin's chief bodyguard<br>
in June, in order to get access to Korzhakov's unique insider information<br>
and sources of funding. Commentators warn that association with Korzhakov,<br>
who is under investigation for alleged extortion, could sully Lebed's image<br>
as a crusader against corruption. But Korzhakov told a press conference in<br>
Moscow on October 11 that he is the victim of a campaign to discredit him<br>
because he has compromising material "up here in my head" on top Kremlin<br>
insiders. (Interfax, October 11) Lebed has made a number of incongruous<br>
alliances on his way to the top. Generally, he has not kept his allies long.<br>
In the words of journalist Yefim Bershin, who took part in Lebed's election<br>
campaign, Lebed is a loner who bases his success on personal charisma rather<br>
than teamwork. (Vek, No. 39, October 4-10, 1996)<br>
<p>
YELTSIN SETS UP EMERGENCY TAX COMMISSION. Trying to convince the nation that<br>
he is still running the country, President Boris Yeltsin gave his second<br>
nationwide radio address on October 11. Yeltsin blamed tax dodgers for the<br>
destitute state of Russia's pensioners, teachers and soldiers, and announced<br>
that he was setting up a special temporary commission to crack down on tax<br>
evasion and ensure that state wages and pensions are paid. Officially, the<br>
commission is headed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. But, zooming in<br>
on the fact that the commission is "subordinate to the president" and that<br>
Yeltsin's chief-of-staff, Anatoly Chubais, was appointed first deputy head,<br>
the media immediately dubbed it "Chubais' Cheka." (The Cheka was Lenin's<br>
secret police.) The commission includes high-ranking representatives of the<br>
economic ministries, the security services, and the prosecutor's office,<br>
although the Security Council is represented only by Aleksandr Lebed's<br>
deputy. Chubais promised that the commission would start work within a week<br>
and be fully operational within a fortnight. (Interfax, Kommersant-daily,<br>
Segodnya, October 12)<br>
<p>
The government's failure to collect taxes is a real problem and Russia is<br>
under heavy IMF pressure to improve procedures. Recent revelations that the<br>
gas giant, Gazprom, owes the state some $2.5 billion in unpaid taxes<br>
reflects the magnitude of the problem. (BBC World Service, October 2 and 13)<br>
The government had hoped that tax collection would improve after the<br>
presidential election, but this has not happened. In the first nine months<br>
of the year the government collected only 75 percent of planned taxes, and<br>
September's haul was but 45 percent of the target and a 29 percent reduction<br>
compared to August. (Delovoi mir, October 9)<br>
<p>
NEW COMMISSION SEEN AS CHUBAIS' CREATION. Anatoly Chubais' new post will<br>
further inflame his critics. Aleksandr Korzhakov, himself seen as a<br>
latter-day Rasputin until his recent ouster, accused Chubais in his press<br>
conference last week of forcing Yeltsin to go through with the presidential<br>
election in a calculated effort to undermine the president's health and<br>
usurp his powers. (Interfax, October 11) <br>
<p>
The business newspaper Kommersant-daily, which calls Chubais "acting<br>
president," sees the commission as the fruit of an artful campaign to wrench<br>
the control of taxation away from Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.<br>
Kommersant-daily argues that Chubais used an ill-fated 18 August<br>
presidential decree on income tax -- which provoked such protest in business<br>
circles and the media that it had to be rescinded a month later -- to get<br>
the State Tax Service withdrawn from Chernomyrdin's jurisdiction and<br>
resubordinated to the president (read, his chief-of-staff). But while the<br>
newspaper sees the commission as essentially a pawn in the Kremlin power<br>
struggle, it laments the fact that Russia is still ruled by means of<br>
backstairs intrigue and "emergency measures." (Kommersant-daily, October 12)<br>
<p>
MIXED SIGNALS FROM MOSCOW ON NATO? Russia's Foreign Ministry appeared to<br>
scramble late last week to reassert Moscow's hard-line stance on relations<br>
with NATO in the wake of security chief Aleksandr Lebed's earlier,<br>
unexpectedly accommodating remarks on that subject during a visit to<br>
Brussels. Addressing a meeting of Russian diplomats in Moscow on October 10,<br>
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov reiterated Moscow's long-standing demand<br>
that a political agreement with NATO is possible only if it confers upon<br>
Russia a real voice in NATO affairs. "Agreement is not an aim in itself," he<br>
said. "We want a document that reflects our concerns and establishes a<br>
system that guarantees our security." (UPI, October 10) In remarks to<br>
reporters that same day, Foreign Ministry press spokesman Gennady Tarasov<br>
said that Moscow remains "resolutely opposed to NATO's planned enlargement,"<br>
which he described as inconsistent with Russia's military-strategic,<br>
political, and economic interests. (Interfax, October 10) The Foreign<br>
Ministry's reaction suggested a possible rift between it and Lebed's<br>
Security Council on the subject of relations with NATO. It also hinted at an<br>
emerging competition between the two bodies -- and between Primakov and<br>
Lebed personally -- for control of Russia's foreign policy agenda. <br>
<p>
For all of that, it is difficult to determine whether Lebed really has<br>
strayed from the Kremlin's line on NATO. Two Polish leaders suggested in<br>
Brussels on October 11 that Moscow had indeed finally resigned itself to<br>
NATO's enlargement and that it is now bargaining simply to "to get<br>
concessions in other areas." They also said that Lebed had come to NATO<br>
headquarters "like a tiger and left like a pussycat." (Reuter, October 11)<br>
But U.S. officials are described as only cautiously encouraged by Lebed's<br>
conciliatory public posture in Brussels. Their optimism is reportedly<br>
tempered by what they describe as the harder edge that Lebed displayed in<br>
his private meetings with NATO officials. They say that those private<br>
exchanges suggested no real shift in Russia's position. (The New York Times,<br>
October 10)<br>
<p>
Nor has Lebed been entirely consistent since his return from Brussels. In<br>
remarks on October 12 he again called for Russia to play a more active role<br>
in NATO's Partnership for Peace program and to fashion a political agreement<br>
whereby Moscow can interact constructively with the Western alliance.<br>
(Reuter, October 12) But only two days earlier a Lebed aide had cautioned<br>
that Lebed's remarks in Brussels meant neither that Moscow had shed all its<br>
apprehensions about NATO's enlargement nor that it had finally resigned<br>
itself to expansion. In his own remarks to a conference in Moscow that same<br>
day, Lebed was reported to have mentioned "NATO's expansion to the East,<br>
towards our borders, to the Baltic republics" as one of a series of<br>
potential threats to Russian security. (Itar-Tass, October 10)<br>
<p>
THE BALTIC STATES<br>
<p>
BALTIC DEFENSE MINISTERS ANNOUNCE JOINT PROGRAMS. Meeting in Riga on October<br>
12, the defense ministers of the three Baltic states resolved to create a<br>
joint commission to coordinate weapons procurement. The action was aimed at<br>
ensuring that the arsenals of the three states are compatible with each<br>
other and with those of NATO countries. The three ministers also announced<br>
that the joint Baltic Battalion (BaltBat) and the planned joint naval<br>
squadron of the Baltic states will be made available for international<br>
peacekeeping operations in 1997 and beyond. In addition, the ministers<br>
requested support for the creation of a common Baltic airspace control<br>
system, and announced that they would appeal for help on this score from<br>
U.S. defense secretary William Perry personally. (Interfax, Radio Riga,<br>
October 13) <br>
<p>
The steps demonstrate the Baltic states' resolve to upgrade their defense<br>
capabilities after some officials of NATO countries -- particularly Perry --<br>
cited insufficient military preparedness as a reason for postponing<br>
consideration of the Baltic states' accession to NATO. To finance the<br>
upgrading the Baltic political leaderships last week confirmed plans to<br>
increase defense spending to the NATO benchmark level of 2 percent of the<br>
national GDP.<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
LEBED DEMANDS SEVASTOPOL FROM UKRAINE. Russia's chief security official,<br>
Aleksandr Lebed, has unambiguously claimed Sevastopol for Russia in an open<br>
letter published in the Russian Black Sea Fleet's newspaper and a Crimean<br>
Russian nationalist newspaper. "We must assert that a territorial dispute<br>
exists, support Russia's right to Sevastopol with historical, legal, and<br>
ethnic arguments, and take into account the will of Sevastopol's<br>
population," Lebed wrote. He called for raising the issue of Sevastopol's<br>
status in Russian-Ukrainian political negotiations and for the legislative<br>
branch to support the executive branch in obligating the Russian delegation<br>
at the Black Sea Fleet negotiations to insist on exclusive Russian basing<br>
rights in Sevastopol. Lebed reiterated the familiar argument that Sevastopol<br>
never lost its "Russian status" because it was not specifically mentioned in<br>
the USSR Supreme Soviet's 1954 decision to transfer Crimea to Ukraine. (Flag<br>
Rodiny, October 5, and Krymskaya pravda, October 10, cited by UNIAN, October<br>
11.)<br>
<p>
Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, in a declaration issued over the weekend,<br>
deplored the "increasingly frequent and open anti-Ukrainian sallies by<br>
Russian officials." While "presuming that President Boris Yeltsin and the<br>
Russian Foreign Ministry have not changed their position," Kiev "sees with<br>
extreme concern that those sallies emanate from senior government officials,<br>
including those responsible for national security." Russian territorial<br>
claims on Ukraine "seriously complicate bilateral relations and destabilize<br>
the situation," and also run counter to Russia's commitments to Ukraine and<br>
the norms of international law, Kiev's statement said. (Interfax-Ukraine,<br>
October 12)<br>
<p>
Lebed laid claim to Sevastopol less directly last month by calling for<br>
informal discussions between Moscow and Kiev and for international<br>
arbitration. He also announced last month that his Security Council would<br>
henceforth take control of Moscow's policy on the Black Sea Fleet and the<br>
Sevastopol issue. Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and the Foreign<br>
Ministry seem thus far to have ignored Lebed's attempt to grab that issue<br>
from them. However, the Duma is now drafting a resolution that is expected<br>
to reassert its earlier claims to Sevastopol in stronger terms. Common<br>
ground on the issues of Sevastopol and the Black Sea Fleet may enable Lebed<br>
and the Duma to overcome their conflict over Lebed's policy in Chechnya. <br>
<p>
Lebed's latest foray may also be in part an attempt to prove that he is<br>
every bit as patriotic as Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov, who has made the status<br>
of Sevastopol -- where the Moscow municipality has significant financial<br>
interests -- into a trademark political issue. Kiev understands this, but<br>
the increased salience of the Crimean issue on the Russian agenda may<br>
encourage hopes among Crimea's pro-Russian parties that a future Russian<br>
leader will adopt their cause.<br>
<p>
U.S. WORRIED BELARUS MIGHT NOT GIVE UP NUCLEAR MISSILES. U.S. defense<br>
secretary William Perry has decided to drop Minsk from the schedule of his<br>
upcoming trip to Russia . The move comes as American concerns mount that<br>
mercurial Belarus president Alexander Lukashenko might renege on the<br>
country's previous pledge to return the last Soviet SS-25 mobile<br>
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) to Russia by the end of the<br>
year. There are two regiments of Russian Strategic Rocket Troops in Belarus,<br>
fielding 18 single-warhead SS-25 missiles. In addition, they maintain two or<br>
three spare warheads.<br>
<p>
In September 1993 the Belarus and Russian prime ministers signed an<br>
agreement in Moscow calling for all the Soviet missiles to be repatriated to<br>
Russia by the end of 1996, prompting U.S. secretary of state Warren<br>
Christopher to call Belarus "a shining example to states around the region."<br>
(The New York Times, October 27, 1993). But Lukashenko, elected in 1994, had<br>
other ideas. He halted the missile transfer in mid-1995 and charged that the<br>
withdrawal agreement had been a big political mistake. Lukashenko also<br>
apparently had money in mind. He was envious of a deal reached between<br>
Russia and Ukraine whereby Russia credited Ukraine for the nuclear material<br>
in the Soviet warheads once deployed on its territory. In February 1996<br>
Lukashenko announced that Russia had agreed to pay Belarus for the plutonium<br>
in its SS-25 warheads. (Interfax, February 27 1996) Then, in July, an aide<br>
to Lukashenko reported that Minsk had once again suspended the withdrawal<br>
because Russia was not making any payments. He insisted, however, that they<br>
would all be gone by the end of the year. <br>
<p>
Lukashenko has also not been above suggesting that Belarus might hang on to<br>
the missiles should NATO expand into Eastern Europe -- despite Minsk's<br>
accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as a non-nuclear<br>
weapons state. (Belarus Radio, April 5 1996) <br>
<p>
Among all the successor states of the Soviet Union, Russia and Belarus have<br>
the closest military relationship, and the Russians have tried to dispel the<br>
notion that there is an impasse over the missiles. Clearly, Russia's<br>
Strategic Rocket Forces -- which would like to finish the redeployments --<br>
have been annoyed. Yet both sides continue to act as if things will work<br>
out. Aleksandr Lebed visited Minsk a month ago and following consultations<br>
with his Belarusian counterpart announced that, while a number of "technical<br>
problems" still needed to be resolved, the two had agreed that the<br>
withdrawal schedule would be met. (Itar-Tass, September 13 1996) As the days<br>
pass, Washington does not seem to be so sure. <br>

NEWS:<br>
<p>
BALTIC STATES FACE RUSSIAN INDICTMENT AT UN The Russian <br>
Foreign Ministry's chief spokesman, Gennady Tarasov, <br>
announced yesterday that Moscow is preparing a draft <br>
resolution, to be submitted to the UN General Assembly, <br>
that condemns Estonia and Latvia for allegedly "depriving <br>
the Russian-speaking population of civil and political <br>
rights." (Itar-Tass, October 10) Earlier this month, <br>
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov had omitted criticism <br>
of the Baltic states from his speech to the General <br>
Assembly's session. The draft resolution will disappoint <br>
those who interpreted Primakov's omission as signaling a <br>
letup in Moscow's propaganda against the Baltic states.<br>
<p>
SHARP RISE IN RUSSIA'S INFLATION RATE. Inflation went up <br>
sharply in Russia during the first week of October, with <br>
consumer prices rising 0.5 percent according to official <br>
government statistics. The rise comes in marked contrast <br>
to the downward trend registered in September, when <br>
prices rose at an average weekly rate of only 0.1 <br>
percent, producing an increase of 0.3 percent for the <br>
month as a whole. Last week's rise means that the <br>
inflation rate for October is likely to be at least twice <br>
as high as September's. (Interfax, October 10)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN SPACE ROCKET TO LAUNCH FROM CANADA. A Canadian <br>
firm has signed a cooperation agreement with Russia's <br>
Komplex Scientific and Technical Center to use the <br>
Russian "Start" launch vehicle to place satellites in <br>
orbit from a space complex in Northern Canada. Akjuit <br>
Aerospace hopes to make its first launch from SpacePort <br>
Canada, near Churchill, Manitoba in late 1998, using <br>
Russian booster rockets that are modifications of the SS-<br>
25 intercontinental ballistic missile. (RIA, October 10 <br>
1996)<br>
<p>
CRIMEAN PARLIAMENT ELECTS NEW SPEAKER. Crimea's Supreme <br>
Soviet yesterday elected Vasily Kiselev as speaker in <br>
place of Yevhen Suprunyuk, who was forced to resign <br>
earlier in the week after pro-Russian deputies accused <br>
him of being too accommodating to Kiev. The 48-year-old <br>
Kiselev, a former farm director, is a member of the pro-<br>
Russian "Union" parliamentary faction. (Interfax, October <br>
10) Under Crimea's draft constitution, the speaker of <br>
parliament wields considerable power.<br>
<p>
UKRAINIAN, NATO WARSHIPS IN JOINT EXERCISES. The most <br>
battleworthy ships of Ukraine's nascent navy, the Hetman <br>
Sahaydachny and the Kostyantyn Olshansky, exercised in <br>
the central Mediterranean jointly with a U.S. naval task <br>
force and with French and Italian naval aviation. The two <br>
Ukrainian ships are headed for home from a joint exercise <br>
with the U.S. navy at the Norfolk, Virginia base. They <br>
stopped en route and also exercised at the British naval <br>
base in Gibraltar. (Interfax-Ukraine, October 9)<br>
<p>
AZERBAIJANI "GENERALS' TRIAL" UNDERWAY. Azerbaijan's <br>
Supreme Court yesterday began the trial of Generals Vahid <br>
Musaev, Rafig Agaev, and Shahin Musaev -- along with 20 <br>
other codefendants -- involved in the June 1995 <br>
conspiracy to assassinate President Haidar Aliev and <br>
seize power. Some of the plotters attempted to shoot down <br>
Aliev's airplane during takeoff from Baku airport with <br>
the president on board. However, the most senior of the <br>
generals, Shahid Musatov, was defense minister under <br>
former Communist Party leader and president Ayaz <br>
Mutalibov, and is being sheltered with Mutalibov in <br>
Russia. (Turan, Interfax, October 10)<br>
<p>
CASPIAN SEA STATUS TALKS STALLED. Deputy foreign <br>
ministers of the five Caspian countries completed three <br>
days of talks on the legal status of the Caspian Sea in <br>
Moscow yesterday. The talks failed in their stated <br>
purpose of preparing a Caspian Foreign Ministers' <br>
Conference to work out that legal status. Further talks <br>
will be held to prepare the Foreign Ministers' <br>
Conference, which has repeatedly been postponed. <br>
(Interfax, October 10) The Moscow talks had themselves <br>
been delayed in an attempt to prepare some form of <br>
consensus. The controversy pits Russia and Iran, which <br>
demand indivisibility of the Caspian and its mineral <br>
resources, against Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and <br>
Turkmenistan, which uphold the sectoral division and <br>
sovereign rights over resources in accordance with <br>
international law.<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
RUSSIA'S PROSECUTOR GENERAL SAYS CHECHNYA PEACE ACCORDS <br>
ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. Russian prosecutor general Yuri <br>
Skuratov has declared that from a legal standpoint the <br>
Khasavyurt accords, putting an end to the fighting in <br>
Chechnya, contradict the Russian Constitution on a number <br>
of points. The accords cannot, therefore, serve as the <br>
legal basis for defining relations between Russia and <br>
Chechnya, Skuratov said. (NTV, ORT, October 10) The <br>
Prosecutor General's opinion  matches that expressed by <br>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in his  speech <br>
to the Federation Council on October 8. Chernomyrdin, <br>
while praising  Aleksandr Lebed for putting an end to the <br>
war in Chechnya, stressed that what  was signed in <br>
Khasavyurt was only a framework document, and that Moscow <br>
does not feel bound by any specific obligations towards <br>
the Chechen opposition  leadership. (See Monitor, October <br>
9)<br>
<p>
ARREST WARRANTS FOR CHECHEN LEADERS PUT MOSCOW IN A <br>
QUANDARY. Prosecutor General Skuratov said that one of <br>
the problems with the Khasavyurt accords was that they <br>
were signed with Chechen chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov, <br>
for whom an arrest  warrant is outstanding. Skuratov said <br>
his office has no power to cancel the  warrants issued <br>
for the arrest of Maskhadov and the political leader of <br>
the Chechen opposition, Zelimkhan Yandarbiev. Although <br>
top-level Moscow leaders, including  Prime Minister <br>
Viktor Chernomyrdin and National Security Chief Aleksandr <br>
Lebed, have held  negotiations with both men, warrants <br>
are still outstanding for their arrest  and the arrest of <br>
other leaders of the Chechen opposition. (ORT, October <br>
10)<br>
<p>
But a lasting  peace will not be negotiated without their <br>
participation, making the outstanding arrest warrants an <br>
embarrassing issue. In Skuratov's opinion, the Russian <br>
Duma  should make the Chechen opposition leaders  "normal <br>
negotiating partners" by granting them an amnesty. (NTV, <br>
October 10) At present, however, the Duma shows no <br>
willingness to do this. According to Yabloko leader <br>
Grigori Yavlinsky, three-quarters of the deputies  <br>
support the war in Chechnya "in one way or another." <br>
(NTV, October 9) The  chairman of the Duma's national <br>
security committee, Communist Viktor Ilyukhin,  strongly <br>
opposes the idea of an amnesty for Yandarbiev and <br>
Maskhadov. Only Duma  Speaker Gennady Seleznev, also a <br>
Communist, holds out a ray of hope, saying the  question <br>
of an amnesty for the Chechen leaders should be decided <br>
"individually,  on a case-by-case basis." (Interfax, <br>
October 10) This may provide Moscow with a way out of its <br>
present awkward position vis-a-vis the Chechen leaders <br>
with whom, whether it likes it or not, it has to do <br>
business.<br>
<p>
KULIKOV CALLS FOR ALL-RUSSIAN REFERENDUM ON CHECHNYA. <br>
Russian interior minister Anatoly Kulikov has called for <br>
the future status of Chechnya to be decided by means of a <br>
national referendum. (Interfax, October 10) Kulikov is a <br>
self-professed member of the "party of war," which gives <br>
no quarter in the battle against Chechen secession. His <br>
call for Chechnya's status to be put to a national <br>
referendum is reminiscent of Mikhail Gorbachev's 1990 <br>
attempts to prevent the break-up of the Soviet Union. <br>
Faced with Lithuania's determination to assert its <br>
independence, Gorbachev in April 1990 shepherded through <br>
the Soviet parliament a bill "on the mechanics of <br>
secession" that, by requiring a pro-secession vote of <br>
two-thirds of the population in places (such as the <br>
Baltic states) with substantial Russian minorities, made <br>
leaving the USSR virtually impossible. Kulikov's call for <br>
an all-Russian referendum on the status of Chechnya seems <br>
to be based on a similar calculation (which might, <br>
however, prove mistaken, given the war-weariness of much <br>
of the Russian population) that the majority of Russian <br>
voters would oppose Chechnya's independence. <br>
<p>
THE DARKER SIDE OF THE INTERNATIONAL ARMS TRADE. Security <br>
guards at the Rosvooruzheniye state-owned arms export <br>
company in Moscow found a bomb in a corridor leading to <br>
the managing director's reception room on the night of <br>
October 8. The device, identified as an OZM-72 anti-<br>
personnel fragmentation mine, was reportedly removed from <br>
the building and safely destroyed. A nasty weapon, the <br>
OZM-72 contains thousands of fragments of chopped wire <br>
and is usually detonated by a tripwire. It can kill <br>
people within a radius of 25 meters. The company's press <br>
service said that the incident was one of several <br>
attempts on the life of managing director Aleksander <br>
Kotelkin. It added that several other top executives of <br>
the company had received death threats after they had <br>
taken steps to see that "some semi-criminal structures" <br>
no longer got a cut from Russian arms exports as they had <br>
under the former management (ITAR-TASS, October 9 1996). <br>
Several other sources questioned the initial reports, <br>
claiming that the mine was "incomplete" or even a dummy. <br>
(Moskovsky komsomolets, Izvestiya, 9 October 1996)<br>
<p>
Rosvooruzheniye had been accused of tax evasion and <br>
illegal foreign currency dealings in April 1995 -- <br>
charges that the company said were the responsibility of <br>
the previous management, headed by Lt.Gen. Viktor <br>
Samoilov. (Izvestiya, April 19 1995) Retired General and <br>
Duma Defense Committee chairman Lev Rokhlin also linked <br>
the company to shady dealings this year, as did Segodnya <br>
military correspondent Pavel Felgengauer. (Itar-Tass, <br>
July 5 1996, Segodnya, 29 August 1996) The present <br>
managing director, Kotelkin, is a protege of Gen. <br>
Aleksandr Korzhakov, the former chief of Boris Yeltsin's <br>
security service. It was recently suggested that <br>
Korzhakov is seeking quick election to parliament at <br>
least in part to take advantage of parliamentary immunity <br>
and thus to ward off an inquiry into his "special <br>
relationship" with Rosvooruzheniye. Aleksandr Lebed, <br>
moreover, is said to have had a hand recently in saving <br>
Kotelkin's job. One of Lebed's less honorable motives was <br>
said to be that he has his eye on Rosvooruzheniye's <br>
considerable financial resources, a treasure chest that <br>
might come in handy should he decide to make another bid <br>
for the presidency. (NTV, October 6 1996)<br>
<p>
The company press service also decided to put an anti-<br>
Western spin on yesterday's bomb incident. It pointed to <br>
the "strange coordination" in timing between what it <br>
called the current slander campaign in the Russian media <br>
against it and the "anxiety" shown by Western competitors <br>
at Russia's growing success in the international arms <br>
trade (Itar-Tass, October 9 1996)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
BELARUS PRESIDENT SENSES VICTORY. Addressing the Belarus <br>
parliament yesterday, President Aleksandr Lukashenko made <br>
the deputies an offer that many couldn't refuse. He <br>
assured them that all would be included in the new <br>
parliament, which the president proposes to create on the <br>
basis of his own constitutional draft, if the deputies <br>
accept that draft and if they support the holding of the <br>
November 7 referendum demanded by Lukashenko. <br>
<p>
Lukashenko's appearance in parliament is in itself an <br>
indication that he smells victory in the protracted <br>
constitutional conflict in which the legislature has <br>
resisted the president's bid to establish a personal <br>
regime. Parliamentary resistance appears to be unraveling <br>
as the president successfully splits the two largest <br>
groupings, the Agrarians and the Communists. Most of <br>
these deputies are at the same time directors of <br>
factories, state and collective farms, or government <br>
institutions, and in those capacities they are all cogs <br>
in the "vertical administrative mechanism" created by <br>
Lukashenko, with himself at the top. They are vulnerable <br>
both to threats of reprisals and to financial inducements <br>
doled out individually to their enterprises by the <br>
president and government. In addition, some of the <br>
Communists deem support for the Lukashenko-championed <br>
merger of Belarus with Russia more important than the <br>
Communists' own preference for a parliamentary as opposed <br>
to presidential system.<br>
<p>
Parliament chairman Syamyon Sharetsky, his predecessors <br>
Mechislau Hryb and Stanislau Shushkevich, and the small <br>
reformist and democratic parliamentary group look <br>
increasingly isolated in their effort to stop <br>
Lukashenko's bandwagon. Other institutions that have <br>
resisted authoritarian rule, notably the Constitutional <br>
Court and the Central Election Commission, are simply <br>
being ignored by the president. Such institutional <br>
weakness may invite the radical extraparliamentary <br>
opposition to take center stage. (Belaplan, Radio Minsk, <br>
Interfax October 9 and 10)<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
UN OPENLY BACKS RUSSIA AND ABKHAZIA AGAINST GEORGIA. <br>
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's special envoy <br>
for Abkhazia settlement negotiations, Edouard Brunner, <br>
has delivered a series of statements strongly supporting <br>
Russian and Abkhaz positions and clashing with those of <br>
Tbilisi. During a visit to Tbilisi Brunner has made the <br>
following statements to the local press: that authorizing <br>
the Russian "peacekeeping" troops to secure the Georgian <br>
refugees' repatriation to Abkhazia would contradict the <br>
UN's cost-driven plans to scale down peacekeeping <br>
operations; that the return of token groups of Georgian <br>
refugees to Abkhazia's Gali district represents the <br>
promising beginning of an overall solution; and that on <br>
the refugee question Tbilisi should patiently wait for as <br>
long as 45 years -- the period it took Israelis and <br>
Palestinians to begin negotiations toward a political <br>
settlement in earnest. Brunner stressed that he "highly <br>
appreciated the Russian peacekeepers` actions" in <br>
Abkhazia. (Interfax, October 9; Iprinda and Kontakt, <br>
October 8) <br>
<p>
In his talks with Abkhaz leaders and at a news conference <br>
held in Abkhazia yesterday, Brunner unambiguously <br>
endorsed the planned Abkhaz parliamentary elections and <br>
held out the promise of international recognition of <br>
their result. Abkhaz leader Vladislav Ardzinba praised <br>
the UN and Russian stance. (Interfax, October 10)<br>
<p>
The envoy's comments dovetail with the Russian and Abkhaz <br>
views and clash head-on with those of Tbilisi. The <br>
comments appear designed to rebut the recent stream of <br>
statements and decisions by President Eduard Shevardnadze <br>
and the Georgian parliament and government. They have <br>
sharply criticized the Russian peacekeeping troops and <br>
Russian policy in general for freezing the situation on <br>
the ground in Abkhazia's favor and encouraging <br>
separatism, including the holding of Abkhaz elections <br>
after the ethnic cleansing of the Georgian population. On <br>
the eve of Brunner's visit, a NATO-sponsored <br>
international conference in Tbilisi on regional security <br>
in the Caucasus similarly concluded that "Russia's <br>
mediation is extremely ineffective, and the Russian <br>
peacekeeping troops have lost credibility."  (Interfax, <br>
October 8)<br>
<p>
In a more discreet fashion, Tbilisi has also criticized <br>
the U.N. for passively following the Russian lead in <br>
Abkhazia. Boutros-Ghali is running for reelection as UN <br>
Secretary General with Russian support. <br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
TAJIK OPPOSITION LEADER DENIES INTENTION TO FORM MILITARY <br>
ALLIANCE WITH TALIBAN. According to Dushanbe officials, <br>
leaders of the Tajik opposition, Akbar Turanjozoda and <br>
Davlat Usmon, have in recent days met with Taliban <br>
leaders in Kabul to discuss joint military action against <br>
the Tajik government in the event that the Taliban <br>
establish control of northern Afghanistan. (Interfax, <br>
October 8) The Dushanbe officials' version echoes the <br>
concern, professed by Russian security chief Aleksandr <br>
Lebed and others, that the Taliban plan both to join <br>
forces with the Tajik opposition inside Tajikistan and, <br>
allegedly, to attack Uzbekistan in order to annex <br>
Bukhara. Tajik officials have seconded Lebed's warnings.<br>
<p>
But in an October 9 telephone conversation with Monitor, <br>
United Tajik Opposition (UTO) leader Akbar Turajonzoda, <br>
now in Tehran, categorically denied any intention on the <br>
part of the UTO to form a military alliance with Taliban. <br>
"Such claims could only benefit forces who want to harm <br>
the Tajik opposition. Our refugee camps are located all <br>
over Afghanistan: in Pushtun, Tajik, and Uzbek areas. <br>
Therefore, we can't take sides in the internal Afghan <br>
conflict, and are strictly observing neutrality," said <br>
Turajonzoda. He told the Monitor that he visited <br>
Uzbekistan about a week ago, as part of an effort to <br>
maintain contact with various interested parties. <br>
Uzbekistan supports the ethnic Uzbek warlord Abdul <br>
Rasdhid Dostum in northern Afghanistan in order to hold <br>
off a possible Taliban advance into the area. <br>
<p>
TURKMENISTAN ACTIVELY SEEKING EXPORT OUTLETS FOR GAS. <br>
Construction work on a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to <br>
Iran began yesterday with an official  ceremony attended <br>
by Iran's oil and gas minister at the Korpeje gas field <br>
in Turkmenistan. Iran is financing 80 percent of the $200 <br>
million project, and the Iranian national gas company has <br>
undertaken the construction. The 200 kilometer long <br>
pipeline, with an annual throughput capacity of  8 <br>
billion cubic meters, is to be completed by the end of <br>
1997. It will enable Turkmenistan to export gas to <br>
international markets via Iran's pipeline system. (Itar-<br>
Tass, October 9)<br>
<p>
This week Turkmen president Saparmurad Niyazov also <br>
discussed with Pakistani officials a multibillion dollar <br>
project -- involving the California-based UNOCAL and <br>
Saudi Arabia's Delta companies -- to build a large-<br>
capacity gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to the Indian <br>
Ocean via Afghanistan and Pakistan. (Western agencies, <br>
October 7 and 8) The Taliban movement, which even before <br>
its capture of Kabul had controlled the Afghan territory <br>
through which the planned pipeline would run, has also <br>
agreed to the project. The pipeline is also of potential <br>
importance to Kazakhstan. Turkmenistan possesses the <br>
world's second-largest gas reserves, but its access to <br>
international markets remains dependent on the Russian <br>
pipeline system, and is thus subject to quantitative <br>
limitations and political manipulation.<br>

NEWS:<br>
<p>
KUCHMA CONCERNED BY POSSIBLE NATO-RUSSIA DEAL. Ukrainian president Leonid<br>
Kuchma charged yesterday that, in disclaiming any Russian intent to veto<br>
NATO's enlargement, Aleksandr Lebed had merely "said what had to be said"<br>
during his recent visit to NATO headquarters. (See perspective item below)<br>
Kuchma expressed concern lest NATO's enlargement be accompanied by a special<br>
treaty between NATO and Russia that could "once again divide Europe into<br>
first-class and second-class countries." Kiev will "definitely speak out" on<br>
the subject in the upcoming 16 + 1 consultations between NATO and Ukraine,<br>
Kuchma said. (Interfax-Ukraine, October 9)<br>
<p>
RUMORS OF YELTSIN'S DEATH EXAGGERATED. A top Kremlin spokesman refused even<br>
to comment last night on rumors that Boris Yeltsin's health had taken a<br>
sharp turn for the worse and that the Russian president might even have<br>
died. "We don't even consider it necessary to comment on these reports,"<br>
said Igor Ignatyev, chief of the presidential press service. (AP, October 9)<br>
<p>
MOSCOW SAYS KURIL ISLANDS WITHDRAWAL TO CONTINUE... Russian deputy foreign<br>
minister Grigory Karasin, just back from talks in Japan, said on October 8<br>
that Moscow will continue its gradual withdrawal of troops from the disputed<br>
Kuril Islands. There are currently 3,500 troops on the islands, he said,<br>
excluding border forces personnel not included in the draw-down. Karasin<br>
also announced that a top-level military delegation will travel to Tokyo in<br>
December to prepare for a visit early next year by Defense Minister Igor<br>
Rodionov. (Interfax, October 8)<br>
<p>
... AS TOKYO INSISTS BORDER ISSUE REMAINS UNRESOLVED. Following Moscow's<br>
promulgation yesterday of a declaration rejecting all territorial claims on<br>
the Russian Federation, the Japanese Embassy in Moscow said that the<br>
territorial dispute between Russia and Japan over ownership of the Kuril<br>
Islands remains unresolved. An Embassy spokesman suggested that the<br>
declaration was irrelevant to the Kuril Islands dispute because the<br>
Russian-Japanese border has not yet been established. (Itar-Tass, October 9)<br>
<p>
GROUND BROKEN FOR MOSCOW SYNAGOGUE. Russian prime minister Viktor<br>
Chernomyrdin and Russia's chief rabbi were present October 7 when the ground<br>
was broken for a new Moscow synagogue. This will be the first synagogue<br>
built in Russia since the Bolshevik Revolution. It will be dedicated to the<br>
memory of the 2.7 million Soviet Jews killed during the Second World War.<br>
Fewer than a million Jews are estimated to live in Russia today. (UPI,<br>
October 8)<br>
<p>
LITHUANIAN COMMUNIST PLOTTERS GO ON TRIAL. A Vilnius court yesterday began<br>
the trial of six leaders of the former Lithuanian Communist party/CPSU,<br>
including First Secretary Mikolas Burokiavicius and Ideological Secretary<br>
Juozas Jermalavicius. The six are accused of being co-organizers and<br>
executants of the January 1991 Soviet crackdown in Lithuania. Approximately<br>
40 codefendants are being sheltered in Russia and Belarus. The prosecution<br>
has assembled a 300-volume dossier and can call more than 2,000 witnesses in<br>
the case. An unrepentant Burokiavicius told the opening session that this<br>
will be a "political trial against communism."  (Itar-Tass, NTV, October 9)<br>
<p>
NEW LEZGIN WARNING TO AZERBAIJAN. The organizing committee of a Lezgin<br>
people's congress yesterday issued to Azerbaijan a second warning. (For<br>
first warning see Monitor, October 9) Yesterday's "declaration" calls on<br>
Russia to deploy Russian border troops on Azerbaijan's borders with Turkey<br>
and Iran. (Interfax, October 9). The call dovetails with Moscow's own<br>
proposals to Baku for "joint protection" of Azerbaijan's "external borders."<br>
It suggests some plan to play once more the Lezgin and, potentially, Talysh<br>
"ethnic cards" against Azerbaijan.<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION <br>
<p>
LEBED HITS BACK. Sergei Kharlamov, deputy secretary of the Russian Security<br>
Council, appeared late last night on Independent Television (NTV) and made a<br>
statement on behalf of Aleksandr Lebed. The broadcast was not announced<br>
beforehand, suggesting that it was arranged only at the last minute.<br>
According to Kharlamov, Lebed thinks "certain speeches" in the Duma and the<br>
Federation Council and "certain press conferences" indicate that those who<br>
oppose a peaceful settlement in Chechnya are growing more active. The "war<br>
party" is now ready to undertake any provocation and has even begun to<br>
accuse Lebed of turning military technology over to the rebels, Kharlamov<br>
asserted. (NTV, October 9)<br>
<p>
Oddly enough, this is the first anyone has heard of allegations that Lebed<br>
has handed military technology over to the Chechen opposition. Lebed's aide<br>
appears, however, to have been referring to recent statements by Interior<br>
Minister Anatoly Kulikov. Kulikov charged at a press conference on October 7<br>
that criminal elements helped Lebed set up the Khasavyurt accords. On<br>
October 8, Kulikov told a closed session of the Federation Council that, "It<br>
can't be called 'peace' when certain Russian politicians, instead of<br>
negotiating seriously, make deals with the separatists, promise to meet all<br>
their conditions and cold-bloodedly give away Russia's interests." (NTV,<br>
October 9)<br>
<p>
Until last night, Lebed had pointedly ignored Kulikov's barbs. When<br>
journalists asked for his reaction, Lebed brushed Kulikov's criticism aside<br>
with the words, "What criticism?! Dogs always bark when the train passes<br>
through." (ORT, October 9) Yesterday's late-night statement by Lebed's aide<br>
suggests that Lebed has found out about a new attempt to compromise him and<br>
decided to launch a preemptive strike.<br>
<p>
LEBED'S UNEXPECTED PRAISE FOR NATO RILES DUMA. Russia's Duma yesterday voted<br>
to summon security chief Aleksandr Lebed to the chamber on October 25 in<br>
order to hear why he had failed to condemn NATO's expansion plans during his<br>
recent visit to Brussels. The Duma action came after Lebed, in remarks to<br>
reporters at the end of his stay in Brussels, unexpectedly disparaged<br>
Moscow's heretofore confrontational policy toward the Western alliance.<br>
Lebed criticized the Kremlin for its attempts to "sustain a 15-year-old<br>
policy under completely new economic, military, and other conditions," and<br>
cautioned that a failure to involve itself in NATO's activities could leave<br>
Moscow isolated on the periphery of Europe. He also said that "people are<br>
doing serious work" in NATO's Partnership for Peace Program, and asked why<br>
Moscow had remained inactive after joining the program last year. By<br>
"refusing to take part, we are placing ourselves outside the bounds of the<br>
process... and as such we will lose the opportunity to have influence on<br>
anything," Lebed argued. Suddenly the pragmatist, Lebed also asked what<br>
other choice Moscow had following the collapse of the socialist system and<br>
the Warsaw Pact, not to mention the disintegration of its own economy and<br>
military might. <br>
<p>
But Lebed intimated that his call for accommodation was not a surrender. He<br>
observed that NATO itself is fractured, and that plans for enlargement have<br>
introduced new financial, social, and political tensions into the alliance.<br>
Lebed did not say directly that Moscow should exploit these tensions. But he<br>
did suggest that the Kremlin would profit more from being on the inside than<br>
on the outside during the alliance's ongoing enlargement debate, and said he<br>
would recommend to Boris Yeltsin that Moscow quickly draft a document<br>
setting out the terms under which it would be willing to work with the<br>
Western alliance. "It is necessary to provide at least a vague outline of<br>
what we want," the retired general said. "Otherwise NATO would build a<br>
system independently, and we would be left outside it." (Itar-Tass, October<br>
8; UPI, Reuter, October 9)<br>
<p>
IISS: DECLINE OF RUSSIAN ARMY CONTINUES. The International Institute for<br>
Strategic Studies (IISS) has painted a dismal picture of the Russian army,<br>
concluding that despite Boris Yeltsin's reelection the "decline in<br>
capability in all departments of the Russian armed forces seems set to<br>
continue." In its annual report on the world's armed forces, released<br>
yesterday, the highly respected institute also discounted Moscow's avowed<br>
plans to adopt a new military doctrine based on rapid reaction forces. It<br>
observed that "organizational changes to develop more mobile formations...<br>
have not been put into effect," and described training and equipment levels<br>
as inadequate to carry out sophisticated operations." The report also said<br>
that Moscow's poor military performance in Chechnya reflected such<br>
weaknesses, and it argued that Russian forces can now hope only "to contain<br>
rebel military actions" and "try to retain control of the larger population<br>
centers" in the war-torn Caucasus republic.<br>
<p>
While the IISS report estimated that military expenditure in Russia had<br>
fallen by about 45 percent since 1992, to approximately $82 billion, it<br>
noted that Russia nevertheless retained the second largest military budget<br>
in the world after the U.S. The report did, moreover, see a few signs of<br>
life in the Russian military. Strategic nuclear forces were said to have<br>
been kept at operational readiness, and a rise in naval activities was<br>
noted. Speaking at a news conference yesterday, IISS deputy director Rose<br>
Gottemoeller also suggested that warnings of an impending mutiny by Russian<br>
soldiers exaggerated the level of dissatisfaction in the army, and stemmed<br>
in part from efforts by some military leaders -- including Aleksandr Lebed<br>
-- to influence Russia's military budget debate. "There are no signs that<br>
troops will drive into the Kremlin in tanks," she said. "Russia is not<br>
facing a planned mutiny." (Reuter, AP, October 9)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
CRACKS OPEN IN BELARUSAN CONSTITUTIONAL COALITION. Some 110 out of 199<br>
Belarusan deputies have signed a proposal for a compromise in the<br>
constitutional conflict with president Aleksandr Lukashenko, essentially on<br>
his terms. The proposal envisages: renouncing the parliament's<br>
constitutional draft and the plan to put it to a referendum on November 24;<br>
accepting the referendum called by Lukashenko for November 7 to endorse his<br>
own constitutional draft; and amending the presidential draft only in order<br>
to increase the number of seats in the Lukashenko-proposed bicameral<br>
parliament and to empower the current parliament to appoint the new upper<br>
chamber. Lukashenko has hastened to accept this proposal and will address<br>
the parliament to cement the deal. In a parallel move the Communist party --<br>
which in principle stands for a parliamentary as opposed to a presidential<br>
system -- has disavowed the constitutional coalition's plan to call a<br>
National Congress for the Constitution and Against Dictatorship as well as a<br>
mass rally in Minsk on October 19. Communist leaders now say that the event<br>
might provoke disorder since a pro-Lukashenko congress is scheduled for the<br>
same day. (Belaplan, Radio Minsk, October 8 and 9)<br>
<p>
Two weeks ago the parliament, supported by the Constitutional Court, had<br>
proposed a zero option whereby the president and parliament would renounce<br>
their respective constitutional drafts and referendum plans and would pledge<br>
to observe the existing constitution. That balanced proposal has now been<br>
superseded by the proposal of the 110, which would amount to a capitulation<br>
in exchange for guaranteed seats for most incumbent deputies in the<br>
emasculated parliament sought by Lukashenko. <br>
<p>
UKRAINIAN NATIONAL-DEMOCRATS LEND HELPING HAND TO CHECHENS. A publishing<br>
house in Lviv (western Ukraine), which is a political stronghold of<br>
Ukraine's national-democrats, has just printed Chechen leader Zelimkhan<br>
Yandarbiev's new book, "Chechnya: The Struggle for Freedom." A consignment<br>
of 5,000 Russian-language copies of the book was confiscated by Russian<br>
customs at the Ukrainian-Russian border, but other copies are being sent to<br>
Russia from Ukraine by circumventing Russian customs. (Interfax-Ukraine,<br>
NTV, October 8 and 9)<br>
<p>
Last week a Chechen Information Center opened in Kiev for the declared<br>
purpose of supplying accurate information on Chechnya and correcting<br>
misinformation often appearing in Russian media. Rukh (the Ukrainian Popular<br>
Movement) is providing legal sponsorship and office space. Rukh leader<br>
Vyacheslav Chornovyl told the inaugural news conference at the movement's<br>
headquarters that the Center could eventually grow into a semi-official<br>
mission, akin to those of Taiwan in some countries. Chornovyl expressed<br>
gratitude to Chechnya for having "helped us a lot by diverting the attention<br>
of Russian imperialists away from Ukraine." (UNIAN, October 4; NTV, October 3) <br>
<p>
The Center is the first of its kind in a former Soviet country, although<br>
individual Chechen representatives authorized by the late president Jokhar<br>
Dudaev and by Yandarbiev have been working informally with sympathizers in<br>
the Baltic states. A Chechen Information Center has been operating since<br>
1995 in the Polish city of Krakow.<br>
<p>
INTER-FACTIONAL DISAGREEMENTS PLAGUE CRIMEAN POLITICS. Factional strife<br>
continues to dominate the political scene in Crimea. Yesterday, the<br>
parliament of the autonomous republic ousted its speaker, Yevhen Suprnyuk,<br>
who is currently hospitalized following a mysterious kidnapping. Pro-Russian<br>
parliamentarians considered Suprnyuk too accommodating to Ukraine's central<br>
government. Until Suprunyuk's replacement is chosen, the post of speaker has<br>
been assumed by Refat Chubarov, leader of the Crimean Tatar parliamentary<br>
faction, which uncharacteristically joined pro-Russian factions in voting<br>
for Suprunyuk's ouster. (RTR, October 9)<br>
<p>
Suprunyuk's removal comes at a moment when Ukraine's Justice Ministry has<br>
revoked the registration of 15 Crimean political parties. Ukrainian law<br>
requires parties seeking legal registration to have a nationwide presence, a<br>
condition that most Crimean parties do not meet. In any case, the Russian<br>
Party of the Crimea, one of those whose status was revoked, has protested<br>
that "a Crimean party with all-Ukrainian status is a legal nonsense."<br>
(Interfax, October 9) Of Crimea's 17 parties, only two -- the Union for<br>
Support of the Crimean Republic and the Party of Economic Rebirth -- met the<br>
requirements; the others have been ordered to close. The Russian Party of<br>
Crimea has tried to find a way around this by dissolving itself and<br>
declaring a new organization, the Congress of Russian People, as its<br>
successor. The new organization held its founding conference last weekend<br>
and elected Sergei Shuvainikov chairman of its ruling body -- the Duma. It<br>
aims to copy the model pioneered by the Crimean Tatars: the congress will<br>
function as an ethnic Russian parliament, along the lines of the Tatar<br>
Mejlis, while the Duma will mimic the Tatars' Kurultai in functioning as a<br>
shadow government. Shuvainikov said a delegation will visit Moscow to<br>
establish formal relations with the Russian government and ask for<br>
"humanitarian aid to compatriots living in Crimea." (Itar-Tass, October 7)<br>
How successful the new organization will be in uniting Crimea's quarrelsome<br>
factions remains to be seen.<br>
<p>
MOLDOVAN PRIME MINISTER AND PRESIDENTIAL LOBBIES MOSCOW FOR TROOPS<br>
WITHDRAWAL. On a two-day visit to Moscow, Moldovan prime minister Andrei<br>
Sangheli and foreign minister Mihai Popov held talks with Russian prime<br>
minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov, defense<br>
minister Igor Rodionov, and the Duma and Federation Council chairmen,<br>
Gennady Seleznev and Yegor Stroyev. Sangheli urged implementation of the<br>
1994 Chernomyrdin-Sangheli agreement on the withdrawal of Russian troops<br>
from Moldova, and for Russian ratification of the bilateral political<br>
treaty, signed by Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Mircea Snegur in 1990 and<br>
ratified only by Moldova. The Russian leaders made no promises on either<br>
count and omitted to mention the troop withdrawal in their public remarks on<br>
the talks. The sides also signed as yet unspecified economic agreements.<br>
Transdniester leader Igor Smirnov attended the talks alongside Chisinau's<br>
delegation. (Flux, Basapress, Itar-Tass, October 8 and 9)<br>
<p>
Moscow apparently has not digested last week's unanimously adopted U.S.<br>
congressional resolution calling for withdrawal of the troops. Russian<br>
ratification of the bilateral political treaty has been withheld because the<br>
1990 text unconditionally recognized Moldova's territorial integrity. This<br>
visit was carefully watched in Moldova for possible signals that Moscow may<br>
favor Sangheli, who is running against Snegur in the current presidential<br>
election campaign. But such signals were not forthcoming, and Sangheli<br>
appeared to return home empty-handed. There was also no word on settling<br>
Transdniester's arrears for Russian fuel deliveries. They amount to $260<br>
million out of Moldova total debt of over $400 million, and explain<br>
Smirnov's unusual participation in the talks. <br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVE ON AFGHANISTAN UNVEILED. Tajik president<br>
Imomali Rahmonov yesterday gave the fullest public expression to date of the<br>
policy toward Afghanistan on which Moscow seeks consensus with the Central<br>
Asian states. That position envisages an immediate ceasefire and<br>
negotiations among "all influential political forces in Afghanistan," and a<br>
UN-sponsored international conference on Afghanistan with the participation<br>
of all regional and "interested" countries. (Itar-Tass, Western agencies,<br>
October 9) <br>
<p>
Moscow often uses allies for the initial airing of potentially controversial<br>
diplomatic initiatives. These proposals appear designed to freeze the<br>
existing military situation before a possible Taliban move into northern<br>
Afghanistan; to preserve a significant role for the defeated<br>
Rabbani-Hekmatyar group which had recently moved toward alignment with<br>
Russia; and to restore at least in part Moscow's old power-broker role in<br>
Afghanistan, this time via an international conference. At such a<br>
conference, Western and Pakistani influence might be more than offset by the<br>
combined weight of Russia, Iran (which is strongly anti-Taliban), and those<br>
Central Asian countries which misperceive the Taliban as a threat.<br>

<p>
FUNDING RUSSIA'S CASH-POOR MILITARY. In remarks before a closed<br>
parliamentary hearing yesterday, Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin<br>
reportedly recommended a special tax to raise money for Russia's<br>
under-financed military forces. Chernomyrdin also suggested that a plan was<br>
being drafted to direct funds from Russian arms sales to the military. At<br>
the October 4 meeting of Russia's Defense Council it was reportedly decided<br>
to earmark government funds specifically for the financing of military<br>
reform and reductions in forces. (Interfax, Itar-Tass, October 8)<br>
<p>
RUSSIA GETS CREDIT RATING. Russia has been awarded a 2B credit rating by the<br>
three leading international rating agencies, Aleksandr Livshits has<br>
announced. (NTV, October 7) This puts Russia in the same category as India,<br>
Mexico, Hungary, and Slovakia, and ahead of Turkey, Venezuela and Brazil.<br>
Livshits said the rating will enable Russia to make its first Eurobond issue<br>
by the end of this year, as planned. The government hopes this will attract<br>
sorely needed western investment since domestic sources of investment are<br>
considered virtually exhausted.<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTER LISTS ARMY DEAD IN CHECHNYA. Russian defense<br>
minister General Igor Rodionov has told the newspaper Komsomolskaya pravda<br>
that 2,941 army troops had been killed in Chechnya as of October 4. His<br>
total does not include air force personnel or troops from other agencies. It<br>
might be some time before a full accounting is made. Last week Aleksandr<br>
Lebed told the Duma that 3,726 federal troops had died, but the Interior<br>
Ministry alone has admitted to more losses than the difference between these<br>
two figures. (Komsomolskaya pravda, October 8, 1996)<br>
<p>
UKRAINE RAISES MILITARY PAY. Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma has decreed<br>
an increase in military salaries and benefits for officers and NCOs, and<br>
established a new system of bonuses and special awards tied to performance<br>
and length of service. The compensation increase averages 180 percent for<br>
various ranks. Defense Minister Aleksandr Kuzmuk said yesterday that the<br>
decree has "great political significance" because it equates officers with<br>
civil servants and will encourage professionals to stay in the army. Kuzmuk<br>
also emphasized pointedly that, despite its financial hardships, the<br>
Ukrainian military has not experienced insubordination. (Interfax-Ukraine,<br>
October 8)<br>
<p>

CHERNOMYRDIN DEFENDS LEBED BUT SAYS KHASAVYURT ACCORDS "NON-BINDING."<br>
Addressing the upper house of the Russian parliament yesterday, Prime<br>
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, expressed full approval of Aleksandr Lebed's<br>
peacemaking activity in Chechnya. (Interfax, October 8) Thanks to these<br>
efforts, he said, "the main goal was accomplished: the war has been<br>
stopped." Moreover, the prime minister scornfully dismissed allegations by<br>
Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov that criminal circles helped Lebed set up<br>
the Khasavyurt meeting. (See Monitor, October 7)<br>
<p>
The prime minister stressed, as he has before, that the Kremlin's position<br>
on Russia's territorial integrity remains unchanged. But his assessment of<br>
the Khasavyurt accords was more surprising. The accords, Chernomyrdin<br>
asserted, were not an agreement, but only a statement of the two sides'<br>
intentions. In other words, Moscow does not consider itself bound by them.<br>
The senators concurred. The Federation Council resolution adopted yesterday<br>
stressed that the Chechen Republic is an integral part of the Russian<br>
Federation and described the accords merely as "evidence of the two sides'<br>
willingness to resolve the conflict by peaceful means." (Interfax, October 8) <br>
<p>
Chernomyrdin's assessment of the Khasavyurt accords as preliminary<br>
agreements having no legal force, in conjunction with the statements<br>
stressing Russia's territorial integrity, will irritate the Chechen<br>
opposition leaders. Chechen chief of staff Aslan Maskhadov has already<br>
issued a statement emphasizing that the Khasavyurt accords he signed with<br>
Lebed make no reference to Chechnya as a subject of the Russian Federation.<br>
(NTV, October 8)<br>
<p>
KULIKOV BACKS DOWN. Chernomyrdin's unequivocal support for Aleksandr Lebed<br>
in his conflict with Interior Minister Kulikov had an immediate effect.<br>
Within hours, Kulikov softened his position. The Khasavyurt accords (which,<br>
a day before, he described as "colossal and absolutely unjustified<br>
concessions") should be "the point of departure for further work to<br>
implement the Federation Council's resolution," Kulikov declared. (NTV,<br>
October 8) Chernomyrdin's support may put a stop to open attacks on Lebed<br>
for a while. It may also, however, have been self-serving. Kulikov's attack<br>
on Lebed was seen by some commentators as more than just the gut reaction of<br>
a representative of the "party of war" to the prospect of a Chechen peace<br>
settlement. One observer, Georgy Bovt, interpreted it as the opening salvo<br>
in Kulikov's own presidential campaign. (Kommersant-daily, October 8)<br>
Chernomyrdin, who has his own presidential ambitions, may have wanted to nip<br>
Kulikov's campaign in the bud. <br>
<p>
Kulikov got the message but another presidential hopeful, Moscow mayor Yuri<br>
Luzhkov, did not. He told journalists after yesterday's session of the<br>
Federation Council that the Khasavyurt accords are "a bomb placed under the<br>
Russian Constitution." Lebed had won a ceasefire, but he had lost the<br>
Russian Federation, Luzhkov said. (Interfax, October 8)<br>
<p>
LEBED UPBEAT ON NATO, BUT IN MOSCOW RESERVATIONS STILL PREVAIL. Talks<br>
between Russian and Western leaders on Moscow's future relations with NATO<br>
continued in several different forums yesterday. The most high-profile<br>
exchange took place in Belgium, where Russian security chief Aleksandr Lebed<br>
was given a tour of NATO's SHAPE headquarters at Mons, near Brussels, and<br>
met with a number of Western leaders. That group included NATO's supreme<br>
commander in Europe, U.S. Gen. George Joulwan, the Secretary-General of the<br>
Western European Union, Jose Cutileiro, and Belgian defense minister<br>
Jean-Paul Poncelet. In remarks to reporters that must have been pleasing to<br>
his various hosts -- and that represented a reversal of Lebed's recent<br>
criticisms of NATO -- the retired general described the West as "civilized"<br>
and said that Moscow would be able to reach a mutually satisfactory<br>
agreement with it on NATO enlargement. The real threat to Russia's security<br>
comes from the South, Lebed added. The Russian Security Council secretary<br>
also suggested that Moscow had mistakenly failed to take advantage of<br>
opportunities presented by NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) program, and<br>
said that he would work to broaden Russia's participation in that program.<br>
Russia joined the PfP last year but has done little since then to activate<br>
joint actions envisioned in the program. (Itar-Tass, Reuter, October 8) <br>
<p>
But Lebed's latest about-face on NATO was not reflected in Moscow. Russian<br>
foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov said yesterday after talks with his French<br>
counterpart that although NATO "can and must play an important role in<br>
European Security," it should not be the linchpin of a future European<br>
security system or fulfill all its key functions. Primakov restated Moscow's<br>
opposition to any political agreement between Russia and NATO that is merely<br>
"declaratory" -- i.e., that does not give Moscow a direct voice in alliance<br>
decisions affecting European security. He also referred again to Moscow's<br>
bitterness over what it alleges is the failure of Western leaders to honor<br>
earlier promises not to extend NATO eastward in the wake of Germany's<br>
reunification. Finally, Primakov intimated that Moscow and Paris had found<br>
some common ground on the need to strengthen the role of the OSCE, which has<br>
long been a Russian goal. (Itar-Tass, Interfax, October 8)<br>
<p>
Also in Moscow yesterday, an unnamed Defense Ministry source said that the<br>
Russian side is busily preparing for an upcoming visit by U.S. defense<br>
secretary William Perry. The agenda for talks between Perry and his Russian<br>
counterpart, Army Gen. Igor Rodionov, would include Bosnia and the ABM<br>
Treaty, the source said, and also European and Russian-U.S. security issues.<br>
The source indicated that NATO enlargement would likely be the most<br>
difficult issue that the two men would tackle, and that Rodionov would stick<br>
to the position that a political or "charter" agreement between Russia and<br>
the alliance should be signed before enlargement proceeds. (Interfax,<br>
October 8) NATO has rejected that position and insisted that three goals --<br>
NATO internal reform, the conclusion of an agreement with Russia, and<br>
enlargement -- would all be pursued concurrently.<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN VOTERS FAVOR PRAGMATISTS. By the end of the year, voters in 52<br>
Russian regions will have elected their governors, most for the first time.<br>
So far, the elections have brought neither the Communist landslide that<br>
Moscow feared nor the consolidation of Kremlin-friendly incumbents Moscow<br>
was hoping for. Voters appear to have lost interest in politics. In these<br>
times of financial hardship, they are choosing candidates they think can<br>
pull their regions out of economic depression, regardless of political<br>
affiliation. The picture that is emerging therefore shows no clear political<br>
pattern. In last weekend's election in central Russia's Kirov oblast,<br>
Communist-backed Vladimir Sergeenkov won 39.7 percent of the vote and<br>
Gennady Shtin, chairman of the region's council of enterprise directors, got<br>
30.5 percent; they will face-off in a runoff later in the month. Sergeenkov<br>
is a member of the Russian parliament, where he belongs to the nationalist<br>
"People's Power" faction. Despite support from Moscow, the incumbent<br>
governor trailed with 17.5 percent. In voting last weekend in Vologda<br>
oblast, north of Moscow, incumbent Vyacheslav Pozgalev swept the board with<br>
over 80.8 percent of the vote. He was supported by "Russia Is Our Home",<br>
Yabloko and Russia's Democratic Choice. The Communist candidate got only 3.2<br>
percent. The Communist candidate was also left far behind in Kaliningrad<br>
oblast, Russia's westernmost outpost. There, incumbent governor Yuri<br>
Matochkin (31 percent) will fight a runoff on October 20 against Leonid<br>
Gorbenko, head of the city's fishing port (22 percent). Gorbenko is seen as<br>
a skilled and pragmatic manager. (NTV, Itar-Tass, October 7)<br>
<p>
PENTAGON INVESTIGATES SOME RUSSIAN MILITARY TECHNOLOGIES. Three Russian<br>
projects are among 37 foreign military technologies the Pentagon will<br>
evaluate in the next fiscal year, according to a Pentagon announcement on<br>
October 8. Heading the list is the M-31 supersonic sea skimming Target, a<br>
modification of the Zvezda Design Bureau's Kh-31 anti-radar and anti-ship<br>
missile, known in NATO as the AS-13. Recently  McDonnell Douglas completed<br>
the first launch and powered flight of the Target. The U.S. bought 4 of the<br>
missiles to be converted into Targets and has an option to buy up to 20.<br>
This year's effort will be to look at an extended range version of the<br>
missile. The other two projects are related to military aviation. One is to<br>
evaluate a Russian process to coat jet engine compressor blades with<br>
titanium nitride to reduce the erosion on the blades -- which are subject to<br>
intense heat and pressure. The other project will look at an advanced<br>
fabrication technology for fighter planes developed by the All-Russian<br>
Institute of Aviation. <br>
<p>
With military procurement cut to the bone, Russian defense enterprises<br>
welcome new funds from any source, but not everyone in Russia is happy with<br>
the idea of the Americans getting their hands on the latest Russian military<br>
and space technology. There was an uproar when the Pentagon bought several<br>
Russian SA-10 surface-to-air missiles over the past two years. There was<br>
also a lengthy battle before Energomash was allowed to export its RD-120<br>
space launch vehicle engine, to be used by a U.S. company in developing a<br>
new American space rocket. <br>
<p>
THE BALTIC STATES<br>
<p>
MOSCOW LOOKS TO BURY BALTIC ARCHIVES. A Russian Foreign Ministry "senior<br>
official" said yesterday that Moscow would consider returning the Baltic<br>
archives to those three states, provided Russia's Duma passes an enabling<br>
law and the Baltic states "clarify why they need the archives." Moscow would<br>
return the archives only if satisfied that the Baltic states would not start<br>
"another witchhunt" and that they would use the archives "for the sake of<br>
historical truth." (Interfax, October 8)<br>
<p>
The interparliamentary Baltic Assembly on October 6 called for the return of<br>
archives taken to Russia at the end of Soviet rule. The archives cover the<br>
Soviet occupation and NKVD/KGB activities in the Baltic states. The Russian<br>
Foreign Ministry's official position is that the Baltic states "joined the<br>
Soviet Union." The Duma has protested the detention of a few top leaders of<br>
the 1991 putsch in the Baltic states as a "witchhunt."<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
TWO NEIGHBORS DISCREETLY QUESTION UKRAINE'S BORDERS. The Ukrainian Defense<br>
Ministry's chief cartographer, Col. Vyacheslav Zhihulin, said yesterday that<br>
the latest session of the Ukrainian-Russian border delimitation commission<br>
had achieved no results because the Russian delegation lacked authorization<br>
to resolve the issues at hand. Simultaneously, according to Zhihulin,<br>
Romania has stopped demarcation work on 60 percent of the length of the<br>
Ukrainian-Romanian border. A Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman told<br>
another briefing, also yesterday, that Romania's Foreign Ministry has called<br>
for opening negotiations over Ukraine's Serpents' Island, which Romania<br>
considers its own. Serheyev ruled out negotiations. The delimitation and<br>
demarcation of Ukraine's state borders constitute a high priority of the<br>
government, the two Ukrainian officials said. (Interfax-Ukraine, October 8)<br>
<p>
The Russian Duma and the Romanian parliament, and also some prominent<br>
politicians in both countries, have called for border revisions in Crimea<br>
and in Bessarabia and Bukovina, respectively. The Russian and Romanian<br>
executive branches do not support such demands, but are nevertheless<br>
delaying the signing of interstate treaties with Ukraine by withholding an<br>
unambiguous recognition of existing borders. The Romanian government also<br>
seeks an admission by Ukraine in the treaty that it wrongfully acquired<br>
Romanian territories. Maritime borders are also under discussion. At recent<br>
sessions of the Russian-Ukrainian Border Delimitation Commission, Moscow<br>
demanded joint jurisdiction over the Azov Sea, instead of its sectoral<br>
partition. Romania officially seeks retrocession of Serpents' Island with<br>
adjacent oil and gas fields in the Black Sea. <br>
<p>
MOLDOVA'S WESTERN-ASSISTED REFORMS REACH POLITICAL CROSSROADS. Prime<br>
Minister Andrei Sangheli, who represented Moldova at the IMF's annual<br>
plenary meeting in Washington and also held talks at the World Bank last<br>
week, has reported to his government that donor countries have already<br>
pledged $150 million in loans and aid to support Moldovan economic reforms<br>
in 1997. Additional "substantial credits" will be forthcoming to support<br>
agrarian reform, he added, if Moldova signs the memorandum negotiated with<br>
the IMF. Western countries and financial institutions will continue<br>
supporting Moldova's reforms if the country stays that course, Sangheli said<br>
in his report made public yesterday. (Moldova Suverana, October 8, cited by<br>
Flux and Basapress)<br>
<p>
The IMF, World Bank, and Paris Club have praised Moldova's performance in<br>
carrying out the first stages of economic reforms, promoted in consensus by<br>
top Moldovan leaders and the governing Agrarian Democratic party. Since last<br>
year, however, President Mircea Snegur has fractured the pro-reform<br>
consensus by demanding that parliament and the government finance social<br>
programs and meet wage claims. He has also encouraged certain trade unions<br>
to advance such inflationary demands against an empty treasury. Snegur faces<br>
a strong challenge from Sangheli and parliament chairman Petru Lucinschi in<br>
the upcoming presidential election. <br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
AZERBAIJAN TARGETED BY LEZGIN GROUP. The "organizing committee of an<br>
extraordinary congress of the Lezgin people" yesterday threatened to launch<br>
a campaign for Lezgin rights that could include "armed struggle." Although<br>
it charges that the Lezgin suffer discrimination on both sides of the<br>
Russia-Azerbaijan border, the statement in fact targeted Azerbaijan by<br>
accusing it of suppressing Lezgin-language education and culture and of<br>
"filling the prisons with the Lezgin people's best sons." The statement<br>
warned of "drastic consequences" if Lezgin demands are ignored. (Interfax,<br>
October 8)<br>
<p>
The Lezgins reside compactly on both sides of the Azerbaijan-Russia border.<br>
The last USSR census (1989) registered nearly 200,000 of them in northern<br>
Azerbaijan and nearly 300,000 in the Russian Federation's Dagestan republic.<br>
Lezgin spokesman cite far higher figures. Since the disintegration of the<br>
USSR, the Lezgin movement Sadval [Unity] has sought to create a unified<br>
Lezgin territorial entity, while Russia's secret services have tried to<br>
channel Lezgin irredentism against Azerbaijan. Sadval split and has been<br>
dormant recently, particularly after some leaders and activists were<br>
detained in Azerbaijan for their role in terrorist bomb explosions in Baku. <br>
<p>
Georgian Ex-Officials Sentenced, Others on Trial. A Tbilisi court yesterday<br>
sentenced former defense minister Tengiz Kitovani to 8 years in prison,<br>
former deputy prime minister Irakly Surguladze to 21 months incarceration<br>
(already served in pretrial detention), and a Russian citizen, Valery Fisun,<br>
to 6 years imprisonment, on charges of organizing an unlawful military<br>
detachment. The defendants refused to attend the proceedings. The charges<br>
stem from Kitovani's and his codefendants' leadership of an abortive<br>
military expedition against Abkhazia in 1995. Their convoy was stopped by<br>
Georgian regular forces. <br>
<p>
Also yesterday, the prosecution in another trial demanded the death penalty<br>
for Loti Kobalia -- who commanded a paramilitary rebellion of supporters of<br>
the late president Zviad Gamsakhurdia in western Georgia -- and for two<br>
former parliamentary deputies who participated in that rebellion. The<br>
defendants consider the court and the current Georgian government to be<br>
illegitimate. (Interfax, October 8)<br>

YELTSIN MOVES FROM HOSPITAL TO SANATORIUM. President Boris Yeltsin has moved<br>
from the hospital where he had been staying since September 13 to the<br>
Barvikha sanatorium near Moscow. Doctors say he will be able to do more work<br>
in the sanatorium and take more physical exercise. Yeltsin is expected to<br>
undergo heart surgery later in the year. (Interfax, October 7)<br>
<p>
MOSCOW SEEKS ROLE IN MIDDLE EAST PEACE TALKS. A Russian Foreign Ministry<br>
spokesman said yesterday that the recent summit of Middle Eastern leaders in<br>
Washington had produced "no movement" in the effort to restart the peace<br>
process. The spokesman described Russia's exclusion from the Washington<br>
talks as a key reason for that failure. (UPI, October 7)<br>
<p>
TOKYO HARDLINES KURIL ISLANDS PROPOSAL. Japan's cabinet remains opposed to<br>
giving economic assistance to Russia or to any third country for the purpose<br>
of developing the "illegally occupied" Kuril Islands, a Japanese Foreign<br>
Ministry official said yesterday. Tokyo will also oppose any action that<br>
would imply recognition of Russia's administrative rights on the islands, he<br>
said. The official's remarks followed a Russian Foreign Ministry statement<br>
suggesting that Tokyo was considering Moscow's proposals for joint economic<br>
activities on the disputed islands. (Itar-Tass, October 7)<br>
<p>
INDIA, RUSSIA DISCUSS ARMS DEALS. A delegation of top Indian military<br>
leaders has arrived in Moscow for talks aimed at deepening military<br>
cooperation between the two countries. The delegation is said to want<br>
especially to facilitate India's purchase of Su-30 jet fighters, artillery<br>
systems, and naval vessels, an Indian Defense Ministry source in New Delhi<br>
said. Also yesterday Russia's Defense Ministry indicated that Defense<br>
Minister Igor Rodionov will himself pay a visit to India late this month.<br>
(Itar-Tass, Interfax, October 7)<br>
<p>
SU-27 FIGHTERS DELIVERED TO CHINA. The Gagarin aircraft factory in<br>
Komsomolsk-na-Amur has announced it has delivered 16 Su-27 jet fighters to<br>
China, using air force pilots from the Far Eastern Military District. Six of<br>
the planes were built at a sister plant in Irkutsk. Said to be the first<br>
export transaction by the plant in several years, it was not clear whether<br>
the delivery was part of a 1992 deal in which the Chinese contracted for 72<br>
Su-27s, or a supplementary delivery. (RIA, October 7 1996)<br>
<p>
AIRCRAFT PLANT SENDS WORKERS HOME. The "Aviakor" joint-stock company in<br>
Samara sent its workers on forced leave until the end of the year because it<br>
has no orders for its Tu-154 jet airliners. They have not been paid since<br>
February. Aviakor was the only Russian aircraft company to sell any aircraft<br>
in 1995, when it sold 9 Tu-154Ms. It had planned to produce 20 this year.<br>
The plant announced it would have to layoff 2,000 workers in an upcoming<br>
major retrenchment. (ITAR-TASS, October 7 1996)<br>
<p>
LITHUANIA ACQUIRING MODERN DEFENSIVE WEAPONS. The Lithuanian military<br>
yesterday demonstrated the first batch of light anti-tank weapons it is<br>
acquiring from Sweden's Bofors. President Algirdas Brazauskas attended the<br>
exercise and fired a missile that destroyed a mock invading tank. Lithuania<br>
will complete a large purchase of these weapons next year and will also<br>
acquire light anti-aircraft weapons. Lithuania's defense concept rests<br>
primarily on these two types of weapons. (BNS, October 1 and 7)<br>
<p>
UKRAINIAN SHIPS COMPLETE ATLANTIC EXERCISE. The escort ship Hetman<br>
Sahaydachny and landing ship Kostyantyn Olshansky, centerpieces of Ukraine's<br>
nascent navy, have completed a two-week mission in the Atlantic. The ships<br>
visited the U.S. naval base at Norfolk, Virginia, conducted joint exercises<br>
with U.S. warships there , and afterward exercised at the British base in<br>
the Gibraltar. (Interfax-Ukraine, October 5)<br>
<p>
 PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
MINISTER'S WRONGDOING USED AS AMMUNITION AGAINST LEBED... President Yeltsin<br>
has fired Shamil Tarpishchev -- his one-time friend and tennis coach -- from<br>
his post as Russia's sports minister. No explanation was given for the<br>
dismissal, which appears to be part of the ongoing campaign by Yeltsin's<br>
chief aide, Anatoly Chubais, to clear the Kremlin of Yeltsin's former<br>
cronies. It also seems part of a new campaign to weaken National Security<br>
Chief Aleksandr Lebed. Tarpishchev was an associate of Yeltsin's one-time<br>
drinking buddy, Aleksandr Korzhakov, who is now rumored to be close to<br>
Lebed. In recent days, Russian television has aired lurid allegations of<br>
bribery and corruption concerning Tarpishchev and Korzhakov. The ins and<br>
outs of these goings-on are probably not significant in themselves; nor are<br>
they well understood by most television viewers. But they provide Lebed's<br>
foes with an opportunity to insinuate that Lebed himself, who vowed to fight<br>
corruption, is in league with corrupt circles. (NTV, October 6; ITAR-TASS,<br>
ORT, October 7)<br>
<p>
...AS KULIKOV ACCUSES LEBED'S AIDE OF CORRUPTION... Allegations that Lebed<br>
is tainted by association with those involved in corrupt dealings were also<br>
made yesterday by Anatoly Kulikov, Russia's interior minister, Kulikov, who<br>
fiercely opposes the Khasavyurt accords signed by Lebed with the Chechen<br>
opposition, told a Moscow press conference that he will testify to the upper<br>
house of the Russian parliament and explain why he views Lebed's brokering<br>
of the Khasavyurt accords as treason. (RTR, Itar-Tass, October 7) Kulikov<br>
said that the accords had not brought peace to Chechnya where, he said, boys<br>
aged 14-15 are being enlisted in rebel units. About 2,500 have been<br>
recruited so far, and some are already getting military training in Pakistan<br>
and Turkey, Kulikov claimed. Closer to home, Kulikov said that Chechen<br>
gangsters are moving to Moscow where they are asserting control over<br>
commercial banks and businesses that were under Chechen "protection" until<br>
the autumn of 1993. In these circumstances, Kulikov said, Russian businesses<br>
are bound to seek protection from "Slav" criminal groups, and the inevitable<br>
outcome will be warfare between Chechen and Russian gangs on the streets of<br>
the capital. <br>
<p>
All of this means that Kulikov's Interior Ministry is going to have its work<br>
cut out and will need extra funds in next year's federal budget. But Kulikov<br>
was not just lobbying for his ministry. He went on to attack Lebed<br>
personally, saying the security chief had employed a known criminal as his<br>
go-between to set up meetings with Chechen opposition leaders. Kulikov<br>
described the case as an example of "the merger of criminal forces with<br>
persons occupying high state posts." (Itar-Tass, October 7) In Lebed's<br>
absence in Brussels, the Security Council issued a statement that the man in<br>
question had indeed worked briefly for Lebed, but only in an informal<br>
capacity. He was dismissed as soon as his true character become known, the<br>
Security Council said. (Interfax, October 7) Kulikov's allegations are<br>
clearly intended to hurt Lebed in the eyes of the Russian public at a moment<br>
when the Security Council secretary's relations with President Yeltsin are<br>
under strain.<br>
<p>
LEBED CONFERS WITH NATO LEADERS. Keen to play the statesman on his first<br>
visit to the West, Russian security supremo Aleksandr Lebed yesterday<br>
dispensed with harsh denunciations of the Western alliance but left<br>
observers divided over whether he had signaled Moscow's acceptance of NATO<br>
enlargement as inevitable. In remarks to reporters that followed talks in<br>
Brussels with top NATO leaders, Lebed described enlargement as "NATO's<br>
business" and said that Moscow would not go "into hysterics" regardless of<br>
decisions made in Brussels. But Lebed also proposed that NATO postpone<br>
expansion until after the alliance carries out internal reforms and then<br>
establishes a special relationship with Russia. Enlargement, if it is to<br>
come, should be left to a "next generation" free of the Cold War's<br>
"mentality of confrontation," Lebed said. The retired general also restated<br>
familiar warnings from Moscow that expansion could doom ratification of the<br>
START II Treaty in Russia's parliament and might lead Moscow to renounce the<br>
Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty. But NATO Secretary-General<br>
Javier Solana reaffirmed the alliance's commitment to pursue internal<br>
reform, the construction of a special relationship with Moscow, and<br>
enlargement on a concurrent rather than a consecutive basis, as had been<br>
proposed by Lebed. He described his talks with Lebed as "very open."<br>
(Reuter, UPI, Itar-Tass, October 7)<br>
<p>
In remarks to reporters upon his arrival in Brussels on October 6 Lebed had<br>
said he would offer some new proposals to Solana that might end the dispute<br>
over NATO enlargement. It was unclear after the meeting if those proposals<br>
went beyond the ideas described above. Lebed also tried to disavow<br>
statements he has made in recent weeks that were harshly critical of NATO<br>
(See Monitor, September 25-26). In fact, those criticisms of NATO followed a<br>
long period during which Lebed was among those Russian leaders least<br>
condemnatory of the Western alliance. Lebed's most recent behavior seems to<br>
reflect the fact that, in many important regards, he is once again running<br>
for Russian president. Lebed apparently believes that alarmist denunciations<br>
of alleged Western threats and chest-thumping declarations of patriotism<br>
play well before his domestic audiences. The trip to Brussels, on the other<br>
hand, has afforded Lebed a first opportunity to appear presidential on the<br>
international stage, and he appears to be conducting himself accordingly.<br>
<p>
THE BALTIC STATES<br>
<p>
MOSCOW STRENGTHENING PRESENCE IN KOENIGSBERG/KALININGRAD. Russian defense<br>
minister Igor Rodionov's just-completed visit to the Kaliningrad region --<br>
described as his first "working visit" to military units since his<br>
appointment in July -- underscored Moscow's new emphasis on strengthening<br>
Russia's presence in that Baltic exclave. The area is seen in Moscow not<br>
only as a military outpost against an enlarging NATO but, more generally, as<br>
a geopolitical asset at a time of receding Russian influence in Europe. An<br>
international conference on developments in the region, just held in<br>
neighboring Poland, reached that same conclusion. (BNS, October 7)<br>
<p>
According to Kaliningrad's governor, Yury Matochkin, Rodionov's visit was<br>
also a political signal that Russia would maintain its presence there,<br>
despite the high costs of doing so. A series of other developments carried<br>
the same message. The command of Russia's border troops opened a new<br>
training facility for border troop officers in the regional capital last<br>
week, the sixth such institution in all of Russia. On September 27 a<br>
makeshift Russian Orthodox church was consecrated in the capital city's<br>
center near the bombed out ruin of the German Lutheran cathedral of<br>
Koenigsberg (once the coronation place of the Kings of Prussia). The Russian<br>
deputy governor declared at the consecration ceremony that the church --<br>
which is to become an Orthodox cathedral -- will "embody the Russian<br>
presence on the Baltic shores... telling everyone that here is the Russian<br>
spirit, the smell of Russia." (Interfax, September 27, October 1) The<br>
region, German since the thirteenth century, was home to some major German<br>
cultural figures and had no Russian inhabitants until the 1945 Soviet ethnic<br>
cleansing of the German population.<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
BELARUS PRESIDENT SHIFTS INTO HIGH GEAR AGAINST REFORMS. President Aleksandr<br>
Lukashenko is moving rapidly to reverse the economic and political reforms<br>
initiated in Belarus before he came to power. On October 4, Lukashenko<br>
signed a decree requiring that imports from countries outside the CIS<br>
customs union be subject to a special, case-by-case governmental review. He<br>
also ordered the cabinet of ministers to set up a task force for "defending<br>
the domestic market" through a national program that will include tariff and<br>
nontariff measures, quotas, import substitution, and subventions to domestic<br>
producers. In addition, Lukashenko issued a decree obligating the government<br>
to guarantee jobs for higher and secondary school graduates and for military<br>
conscripts upon discharge. In an address on the Soviet-era Teachers' Day,<br>
the president also warned against the risks of "de-ideologization." He<br>
deplored both the "reckless abandonment of the experience of previous years"<br>
and called for ideological education and a restoration of Red Pioneers'<br>
organization in the schools. (Belaplan, October 3 and 5; Interfax, October<br>
3, 4, and 7)<br>
<p>
Lukashenko has in recent days shown less than full confidence in the outcome<br>
of the constitutional referendum he plans to conduct on November 7 in a bid<br>
for more personal power. He may now be trying to leave an indelible mark on<br>
state policy before facing that test, which appears to be posing an<br>
increasing risk to his presidency. The retreat from reforms forced the World<br>
Bank to announce two weeks ago the suspension of lending to Belarus. <br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
AZERBAIJAN, IRAN CAUTIOUSLY EXPLORE CLOSER TIES. Senior officials of<br>
Azerbaijan and Iran signed yesterday in Tehran a memorandum of understanding<br>
on Iranian gas supplies to Azerbaijan's exclave, the Autonomous Republic of<br>
Nakhichevan. The memorandum covers a 30 year period and includes other<br>
Iranian deliveries to Nakhichevan as well. A special gas pipeline will be<br>
laid from Iran to Nakhichevan. The delegations also agreed to form bilateral<br>
commissions for cooperation in oil and gas, transportation,<br>
telecommunications, trade, customs, banking, and other sectors. Iran's first<br>
vice president, Hassan Habibi, is due to visit Azerbaijan shortly. (Turan,<br>
IRNA, October 7)<br>
<p>
Nakhichevan, long a political fief of Azerbaijani president Haidar Aliev, is<br>
separated from the heartland of Azerbaijan by a strip of Armenian territory<br>
and is blockaded by Armenian Karabakh forces. Iran alone provides a lifeline<br>
to Nakhichevan, as it also does for blockaded Armenia. Relations between<br>
Azerbaijan and Iran have undergone periodic ups and downs, and seem<br>
currently to be on an upswing following Iran's inclusion in Azerbaijan's<br>
Shah-Deniz oil and gas contract (see Monitor, October 7)<br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
MOSCOW DIVIDED ON RESPONSE TO AFGHAN CONFLICT. The success of the Islamic<br>
fundamentalist movement, Taliban, in gaining control of most of Afghanistan<br>
has exposed rifts in Moscow over the proper response to the situation.<br>
Russia's chief security official, Aleksandr Lebed, persists (as he did even<br>
during his visit to NATO headquarters in Brussels) in claiming that the<br>
Taliban are about to move against Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Lebed has urged<br>
that Russia draw a forward line of defense inside Afghanistan by supporting<br>
a coalition of ethnic Uzbek and ethnic Tajik forces in that country. Several<br>
senior military officials have quietly echoed Lebed. They cite intelligence<br>
reports on alleged Taliban plans to annex Bukhara from Uzbekistan and to<br>
join the opposition forces inside Tajikistan.<br>
<p>
But Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Defense Council Secretary Yury<br>
Baturin, and the last Soviet commander in Afghanistan, Col. Gen. Boris<br>
Gromov -- now an influential Duma deputy -- are urging a wait-and-see<br>
attitude and the extension of diplomatic feelers to the Taliban. In an<br>
unmistakable rebuttal to Lebed, Baturin said yesterday that he opposes any<br>
support to forces inside Afghanistan. He also said that Russian forces<br>
currently deployed on the border can defend it without reinforcements.<br>
Gromov pointed out that the Taliban lack the strength to move against either<br>
Uzbekistan or Tajikistan, and that Russia equally lacks the wherewithal for<br>
another adventure in Afghanistan. The commander of Russian border troops,<br>
Gen. Andrei Nikolayev, and Russian generals in Tajikistan, suggest that<br>
Russia can ill-afford sending significant reinforcements to the region. They<br>
are urging the Central Asian countries to contribute more troops to CIS<br>
forces in Tajikistan. The preponderance of official opinion is clearly<br>
against Lebed's advice. (Interfax, Itar-Tass, October 6 and 7)<br>

NEWS:=20<br>
<p>
RUSSIA MAINTAINS LOW INFLATION. According to official government statistics,<br>
consumer prices grew in Russia in September by 0.3 percent (in August,<br>
prices fell by 0.2 percent). Prices of foodstuffs (especially fruit and<br>
vegetables) fell 0.5 percent, though last month's fall was less than in<br>
August, when food prices dropped 1.7 percent. If this trend is maintained,<br>
the inflation rate by the end of this year could be as low as 17.7 percent<br>
(compared with 131 percent in 1995). The government hopes that will<br>
facilitate a fall in interest rates that will in turn encourage investment<br>
in Russian industries. (Interfax, October 3)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN-INHABITED DISTRICTS WANT TO LEAVE CHECHNYA. Inhabitants of the<br>
northern regions of Chechnya, where the majority of Chechnya's ethnic<br>
Russians live, are collecting signatures calling for their districts to<br>
leave Chechnya and join Russia proper. Chechnya's Naursky and Nadterechny<br>
districts, which were part of Stavropol krai until 1957, launched the<br>
petition, and inhabitants of Urus-Martan, Shatoi, Achkhoi-Martan and<br>
Shelkovsky districts are also said to be interested. There are reports of<br>
defense units being formed in these districts. (RIA news agency, October 1)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT CALLS ON PRESIDENT TO TIGHTEN CONTROL OVER TELEVISION.<br>
Russia's Communist-dominated Duma has called on President Yeltsin to bring<br>
Russian Public Television (ORT) under full state control. At present, the<br>
state owns 51 percent of ORT and 100 percent of Russian Television (RTR).<br>
Parliamentarians complain the TV coverage they get is too little and too<br>
negative, and hard-liners claim it lost them the presidential election. They<br>
want Yeltsin to create an all-party watchdog to oversee ORT. Yabloko party<br>
deputies voted against it, saying the proposal amounted to censorship and<br>
expropriation. (ORT, AP, October 4)<br>
<p>
UKRAINIAN TRADE DEFICIT COMPLICATES REFORMS. Deputy prime minister Viktor<br>
Pynzenyk told the International Monetary Fund's annual plenary meeting in<br>
Washington that Ukraine's reform program needs greater support because of<br>
the country's low currency reserves and its trade deficit, aggravated by<br>
recent Russian protectionist measures. Kiev hopes that the donor and<br>
creditor countries will, at the upcoming Paris meeting of the Consultative<br>
Group on Ukraine, decide to increase balance-of-payments-support loans to<br>
Ukraine and make an overdue start toward Ukraine's admission to the World<br>
Trade Organization. (Interfax-Ukraine, October 4)<br>
<p>
AZERBAIJAN-RUSSIA RAILWAY REOPENED. Russian authorities reopened<br>
cross-border traffic on the Azerbaijan-Russia railroad as of October 5, but<br>
with severe restrictions. Basically, only women and children are allowed to<br>
travel without special permission from Russian border guards. (Interfax,<br>
October 5) The railroad, as well as the highways which connect Azerbaijan to<br>
Russia via Dagestan, were closed in December 1994 by Moscow in order to<br>
isolate Chechnya, severely damaging Azerbaijan's foreign trade in the=<br>
 process.=20<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
FINANCE MINISTER SAYS RUSSIA WILL NOT PAY FOR CHECHEN RECONSTRUCTION UNTIL<br>
REPUBLIC'S STATUS IS SETTLED. Russian finance minister Aleksandr Livshits<br>
says that the Russian government cannot start financing the rebuilding of<br>
war-devastated Chechnya until the republic's political status is determined.<br>
(RTR, Interfax, October 5) If the government stuck to this position, it<br>
would undermine the Khasavyurt peace accords, which made a ceasefire<br>
possible by putting Chechnya's status on ice for five years. But Livshits'<br>
words look more like a bargaining chip.<br>
<p>
Negotiations are currently going on over the composition of the coalition<br>
government, which will include representatives of the Chechen opposition,<br>
the Coordinating Council of Political Parties and Movements and the<br>
pro-Moscow government of Doku Zavgayev. According to Moscow News, the<br>
premiership is "the main subject of horsetrading." The opposition wants its<br>
leader, Zelimkhan Yandarbiev, to be prime minister and chairman of the State<br>
Defense Committee. Moscow has its own candidates for premier -- either<br>
Ruslan Khasbulatov or Mayerbek Mugadiyev, former first deputy premier in<br>
President Dudayev's government who now works for Gazprom. The opposition<br>
holds a strong hand since it is in de facto control of the republic, but its<br>
authority could be weakened if Moscow refused funding to keep the population<br>
fed and housed. Moscow also has some strong cards, therefore, and is likely<br>
to link ministerial seats to provision of economic assistance. (Moskovskie<br>
novosti, No. 39, September 29) Livshits seems to have been signaling the<br>
Chechen leaders that Moscow requires more concessions before it will provide<br>
economic aid.<br>
<p>
PARLIAMENT AND PRESIDENT BATTLE OVER RUSSIA'S 1997 BUDGET. Russian<br>
parliamentarians threatening to reject the draft federal budget when it<br>
comes up for debate on October 11 have been warned by members of the<br>
pro-government faction that President Yeltsin could respond by exercising<br>
his constitutional prerogative to dissolve the Duma. (Nezavisimaya gazeta,<br>
October 5) This would be a desperate move on the government's part,<br>
requiring the calling of fresh general elections, but the government has<br>
already warned that it cannot increase social spending beyond the amounts<br>
already proposed.<br>
<p>
MILITARY REFORM DEBATE REFLECTS KREMLIN POWER STRUGGLE. Kremlin intrigue<br>
deepened in recent days even as the Russian government seemed set at last to<br>
initiate a military reform effort that had been anticipated since Boris<br>
Yeltsin's election victory and the mid-July appointment of Igor Rodionov as<br>
defense minister. At a closed door session of Russia's recently formed<br>
Defense Council on October 4, government leaders and chiefs of Russia's<br>
armed forces and various security structures were said to have examined<br>
proposals for the restructuring of the country's defense establishment in<br>
light of existing economic problems. Reports of the meeting were vague, and<br>
some intimated that the three-hour session had been contentious. They<br>
suggested that the meeting had approved a Defense Ministry proposal that<br>
will cut the size of the regular armed forces from 1.5 to 1.2 million<br>
soldiers while eliminating scores of low-readiness or poorly-manned units.<br>
The goal, according to some commentators, is a more compact and capable<br>
military force of about 12 fully-staffed divisions. Reports indicated that<br>
the top-heavy command bureaucracies in all of the power ministries might<br>
also face reductions, while funding shortages will delay until 2005 the<br>
transition to an all-volunteer military force. (Boris Yeltsin had earlier<br>
called for an end to conscription by 2000). Military spending will<br>
reportedly rise next year to cover funding arrears to the armed forces and<br>
to pay for the proposed reductions, but the hope is that a much reduced<br>
military establishment will be cheaper to maintain over the longer haul.<br>
(Russian and Western agencies, Segodnya, October 4; NTV, October 5)<br>
<p>
Rodionov has long complained of the costly proliferation of non-Defense<br>
Ministry forces, but it was unclear whether he had won a commitment either<br>
to reduce those forces substantially or to strengthen the regular military<br>
command's status relative to the other power structures. However, the<br>
parallel announcement on October 4 that Rodionov had been promoted to Army<br>
General and that six top commanders had been dismissed seemed to signal a<br>
consolidation of his position within the military bureaucracy. Among those<br>
sacked were Airborne Forces commander Col. Gen. Yevgeny Podkolzin, Military<br>
Space Forces commander Col. Gen. Vladimir Ivanov, First Deputy General Staff<br>
chief Lt. Gen. Vladimir Zhurbenko, and the chief of the Defense Ministry's<br>
main personnel directorate, Col. Gen. Yevgeny Vysotsky. All six were said to<br>
have opposed the proposed military reductions. The departure of the<br>
outspoken Podkolzin was especially significant. It came amid reports that<br>
his elite Airborne Forces would be among the biggest losers in the army's<br>
impending reorganization. (Russian TV, Segodnya, October 4)<br>
<p>
The October 4 Defense Council meeting and the events that surrounded it were<br>
equally significant from a political point of view. Lebed's chief political<br>
rival, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, presided over the proceedings,<br>
while Lebed himself chose pointedly not to attend. That decision was at<br>
least in part a protest of Boris Yeltsin's decision last week to name<br>
Defense Council secretary Yury Baturin -- and not Lebed -- as head of a<br>
presidential commission overseeing appointments to top military posts. There<br>
is no doubt, moreover, that the Defense Council's high-profile October 4<br>
meeting, its first,  strengthened that body as a political counter-weight to<br>
Lebed's own Security Council.=20<br>
<p>
RUSSIA FLEXES ITS STRATEGIC NUCLEAR MUSCLE. In a coordinated exercise held<br>
last week to end the "Redut-96" test of Russia's strategic nuclear forces,<br>
the country's Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF), long-range Air Force, and Navy<br>
all launched strategic nuclear missiles. The SRF fired a "Topol" SS-25 ICBM<br>
from the Plesetsk test site under the personnel supervision of its chief,<br>
Gen. Igor Sergeyev. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was at the Air Force<br>
control center when Air Force crews fired two cruise missiles -- one from a<br>
Tu-160 "Blackjack" supersonic bomber and the other from an older Tu-95 MS<br>
"Bear" turboprop. (Russian television noted that the pilots of these planes<br>
had not been paid in 3 months but were happy to be taking part in such a<br>
prestigious event.) And in the Northern Fleet, a nuclear submarine launched<br>
a ballistic missile from the Barents Sea to a target area in the Russian Far<br>
East.<br>
<p>
At a time when the Russian military is in such a sorry state, the nuclear<br>
forces are all the more important. They are seen as the guarantors of<br>
Russia's security while the painful reform of the conventional forces takes<br>
place. Nezavisimaya gazeta noted that Aleksandr Lebed was scheduled to visit<br>
the central command post of the SRF later this month, and speculated that he<br>
might even press the button to launch a "Topol" missile on another test. The<br>
paper also touted Sergeyev to be the next chief of staff, replacing Gen.<br>
Mikhail Kolesnikov-reportedly not on close terms with either Rodionov or<br>
Lebed. (Itar-Tass October 3 &amp; 4, RTV October 4, Nezavisimaya gazeta, October<br>
5 1996)<br>
<p>
CIS AFFAIRS=20<br>
<p>
GAZ POISED FOR BREAKTHROUGH. Russia's GAZ automobile plant is moving into<br>
CIS countries by establishing assembly plants in partnership with local<br>
firms which had previously functioned mainly as repair plants for<br>
Russian-made cars. GAZ joint ventures became operational and produced their<br>
first cars on October 4 in Chisinau, Moldova, and on September 21 in Almaty,<br>
Kazakhstan. GAZ also established joint ventures in the Ukrainian cities<br>
Kremenchug and Simferopol recently. The Chisinau plant has a production<br>
capacity of  2,000 vehicles for the first year, while the Almaty plant is<br>
projected for 2,500 to 4,000 vehicles after the first year. All these<br>
ventures will focus on assembling the GAZ company's successful Gazelle light<br>
truck, with a carrying capacity of 1.5 tons, for both local use and export<br>
to Balkan and Central Asian countries. (Itar-Tass, Interfax, September 21<br>
and October 4)<br>
<p>
GAZ, located in Nizhny Novgorod, appears to be the first Russian<br>
manufacturing plant to be poised for a breakthrough in CIS countries. The<br>
company calculates that assembling the vehicles inside the potential market<br>
makes it possible to lower the sale price and capture the market. The offer<br>
looks attractive to the host countries because it promises to capitalize on<br>
a pre-existing technological base, revitalize and upgrade production<br>
capacities, re-employ their idled workforce, supply these countries' markets<br>
with affordably-priced vehicles, and generate export revenue.<br>
<p>
THE BALTIC STATES<br>
<p>
NATO ENLARGEMENT IN BALTIC REGION -- A "GEOPOLITICAL IMPERATIVE." Latvian<br>
president Guntis Ulmanis told a regular session of the Baltic Assembly, held<br>
in Riga at the weekend, that Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania "cannot be made<br>
hostages to Russia's outdated perception of NATO as a threat" and "will<br>
never accept being regarded as part of a Russian zone of influence." Because<br>
of the Baltic states' geostrategic location, Ulmanis observed, a<br>
hypothetical Baltic neutrality would endanger not only the region's own<br>
security, but also that of Europe. Hence, a U.S. and NATO presence in the<br>
region is "a historical necessity and a geopolitical imperative." The Baltic<br>
states will redouble efforts to meet the qualifications for joining NATO and<br>
"will not passively accept a new redivision of Europe," Ulmanis said in<br>
remarks echoed by other speakers. (BNS, Western agencies, October 5 and 6)<br>
<p>
The remarks obliquely rebutted the case for an open-ended postponement of<br>
Baltic accession to NATO, as reflected most recently in statements by U.S.<br>
defense secretary William Perry and other Pentagon officials that have<br>
shocked the Baltic states. Their leaders agree to substantially increase<br>
defense spending and intensify dialogue with Russia, but seek a specific<br>
NATO plan to upgrade Baltic forces and a timetable for admission to NATO.<br>
The Baltic Assembly, a representative body of the Estonian, Latvian, and<br>
Lithuanian parliaments, meets twice annually to issue recommendations on<br>
issues of common interest to the three countries.<br>
<p>
LATVIA THREATENED BY RUSSIAN DUMA. Russia's Duma on October 4 adopted by 258<br>
votes to 0 a special resolution calling for economic sanctions against<br>
Latvia in order to effect a "radical improvement in the situation of<br>
Russian-speakers." The Duma charged that the Latvian parliament's August 22<br>
declaration on the Soviet occupation of Latvia (see Monitor, August 23 and<br>
26) reflected Latvia's "nationalist ambitions" and "crudely distorted the<br>
truth about Latvia's entry into the Soviet Union" in order to justify<br>
"discrimination against Russian-speakers." (Itar-Tass, October 4) Russia's<br>
executive branch has previously ignored such appeals, although some Foreign<br>
Ministry and presidential officials have occasionally intimated that they<br>
may lend an ear to calls for sanctions against Estonia and Latvia. The fact<br>
that there were no votes against the resolution shows that the minority of<br>
pro-government and democratic deputies, who probably disagree with such<br>
resolutions, lack the resolve to swim against the nationalist-Communist=<br>
 current.<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
AZERBAIJAN RATIFIES SHAH-DENIZ CONTRACT. The parliament of Azerbaijan on<br>
October 4 ratified the country's contract with an international consortium<br>
to explore and develop the Shah-Deniz gas and oil field in Azerbaijan's<br>
sector of the Caspian Sea's continental shelf. Ratification had been held up<br>
for several weeks by deputies of the Popular Front and other minority<br>
groups, who argued that the contract was not bringing advantages to the<br>
people of Azerbaijan. They ultimately stormed out of the October 4<br>
parliamentary session.=20<br>
<p>
Signed in June 1996 and worth $4 billion, the Shah-Deniz contract is<br>
Azerbaijan's second-largest after a 1994-95 agreement, worth $7.5 billion,<br>
on the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli offshore fields. The Shah-Deniz consortium is<br>
comprised of British Petroleum and Norway's Statoil acting in tandem with a<br>
25.5 percent stake each; Elf Aquitaine of France, Russia's LUKoil, Iran's<br>
Oil Industries, and Azerbaijan's State Oil Company with 10 percent each; and<br>
Turkey's TPAO with 9 percent. U.S. companies that initially bid for<br>
participation withdrew after Azerbaijan agreed to include Iran, which had<br>
been excluded from previous oil deals at U.S. request.=20<br>
<p>
The field is estimated to contain 400 billion cubic meters of natural gas,<br>
200 million tons of gas condensate, and 100 million tons of oil, at a depth<br>
ranging from 60 to 550 meters. Development and extraction are envisaged for<br>
a 35-year period, with production to come on stream by the year 2002. It<br>
will not only meet Azerbaijan's gas needs but can turn the country into a<br>
significant gas exporter. Shah-Deniz is one of 24 prospective fields<br>
considered ready for drilling in Azerbaijan's Caspian sector. (Petroleum<br>
Information Agency, Turan, UPI, October 4 and 5)<br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN-CENTRAL SUMMIT ON AFGHANISTAN INCONCLUSIVE. On October 4 and 5,<br>
Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and other senior officials<br>
conferred in Kazakhstan's capital Almaty on joint measures to deal with the<br>
situation in Afghanistan following the military victory of the Taliban<br>
movement. Present were the presidents and "force ministers" of Kazakhstan,<br>
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. A joint communique couched in<br>
alarmist tones condemned the Taliban for "brutal reprisals" and expressed<br>
concern over a possible extension of the fighting to the borders of<br>
neighboring Central Asian countries, but stopped short of calling for<br>
immediate military measures. It urged an immediate ceasefire in Afghanistan<br>
and warned that the CIS countries may invoke their 1992 Collective Security<br>
Treaty to deal with "instability on their borders."=20<br>
<p>
But the meeting's participants also came out against any outside<br>
intervention in Afghanistan and called on the UN Security Council to deal<br>
with the situation without delay. The military officials issued a communiqu=<br>
=8E<br>
in the name of the CIS Military Cooperation council which spoke of proposals<br>
to be forwarded to the CIS Council of Defense Ministers for their<br>
consideration. (Russian and Western agencies, October 4 and 5) The two<br>
communiques appeared to reflect a compromise between advocates of a<br>
wait-and-see attitude and political solutions, and proponents of military<br>
countermeasures, who appear to be in the minority at this stage.=20<br>

THE FORTNIGHT IN REVIEW -- A BI-WEEKLY ON THE POST-SOVIET STATES<br>
<p>
Chechnya: Russian Government Moves to Consolidate Peace at Last <br>
	The Chechen peace process took a major step forward on October 3 when the<br>
leader of the Chechen opposition, Zelimkhan Yandarbiev, traveled to Moscow<br>
for long awaited talks with the Russian government. He and Prime Minister<br>
Viktor Chernomyrdin signed an agreement setting up the Joint Commission<br>
envisioned in the August 31 Khasavyurt accords, which brought the 21-month<br>
conflict to an end. The commission will oversee the withdrawal of Russian<br>
troops and the reconstruction of housing, health and other public services<br>
in the war-ravaged republic. The meeting took place just one day after<br>
Security Council Secretary Aleksandr Lebed, who brokered the Khasavyurt<br>
accords, was fiercely criticized by Russian parliamentarians for his efforts<br>
to resolve the conflict. But the fact that Chernomyrdin signed the October 3<br>
agreement meant that Moscow for the first time officially recognized the<br>
validity of the Khasavyurt accords. Until then, the Russian government had<br>
refused to express a clear opinion and the legal status of the peace<br>
settlement had been in doubt. <br>
<p>
Tensions Erupt Between Yeltsin and Lebed <br>
	Also on October 3, President Boris Yeltsin expressed unequivocal approval<br>
for the first time of Lebed's peace efforts. Yeltsin was making the first of<br>
a series of radio addresses intended to reassure the Russian public that he<br>
is not a lame duck president, even though he will have to recuperate for at<br>
least two months after his impending heart operation and may be away from<br>
the Kremlin until the new year. "My aide Aleksandr Lebed," the president<br>
said in an apparent effort to claim the credit, "has carried out my<br>
instructions and put an end to the bloodshed." Earlier in the day, Yeltsin<br>
and Lebed had held their first face-to-face meeting since mid-August, when<br>
Yeltsin first gave Lebed responsibility for ending the Chechen war. Their<br>
latest meeting was stormy and at one point Lebed threatened to resign.<br>
Yeltsin's response was to reprimand Lebed on national television, telling<br>
him publicly to get in line and stop quarreling with the government. Lebed<br>
did nothing of the kind: on October 4, he snubbed his colleagues by<br>
pointedly refusing to turn up for the first meeting of the Defense Council,<br>
newly created by Yeltsin to oversee military reform and counterbalance<br>
Lebed's own Security Council.<br>
<p>
Wrangling Over NATO <br>
	The issue of NATO enlargement dominated East-West diplomacy in the past two<br>
weeks, as alliance leaders insisted they would stay the course while Moscow<br>
sandwiched slivers of resigned acceptance between chunks of customary<br>
truculence. Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Defense Minister Igor<br>
Rodionov insisted that Moscow would not allow enlargement to threaten<br>
cooperation between Russia and the West. But their grudging nods to<br>
pragmatism did not prevent a bevy of Russian leaders -- Primakov and<br>
Rodionov among them -- from reiterating strong objections to NATO's plans<br>
and, in some cases, threatening various kinds of reprisal.<br>
	The search for accommodation on NATO enlargement was complicated by<br>
Russia's quickening domestic political struggle. With President Yeltsin, the<br>
country seemed to be moving toward a situation reminiscent of that which<br>
prevailed during the presidential campaign earlier in the year. Nationalist<br>
posturing was the order of the day then, which meant that diplomacy often<br>
had to take a back seat to domestic politicking. A power-hungry Aleksandr<br>
Lebed, suddenly obdurate on NATO enlargement, may emerge as the wild card in<br>
Moscow's pack. While a planned trip on October 7 to NATO's Brussels<br>
headquarters may provide a more positive picture of the former general's<br>
views on NATO expansion, his recent comments have given Western leaders<br>
little ground for optimism.<br>
<p>
Helsinki To New York <br>
	Criss-crossing the Atlantic on the weekend of September 21-22, Primakov and<br>
U.S. defense secretary William Perry emerged as the leading players in the<br>
latest jousting over enlargement. Perry told reporters on the plane to<br>
Finland that Moscow's slow progress in destroying its tactical nuclear<br>
weapons could force the West to renege on earlier, informal assurances to<br>
Russia that NATO would not station nuclear weapons in newly-admitted Eastern<br>
European member-states. In Helsinki, Perry balanced strong reaffirmation of<br>
Washington's commitment to enlargement with proposals to give Moscow a<br>
significant voice in NATO affairs, including possible participation in<br>
various NATO committees. But his references to the conclusion of a "charter"<br>
between Russia and NATO made it clear that Moscow would not receive voting<br>
rights.<br>
	Primakov mentioned neither the proposed charter nor Washington's call for<br>
an expanded Partnership for Peace program during a speech to the OSCE in<br>
Vienna on September 20. Instead, he restated Moscow's objections to<br>
enlargement and its desire to see the OSCE become Europe's central security<br>
structure. But in the remarks made in New York on September 23 the Russian<br>
foreign minister made it clear that, despite its objections to enlargement,<br>
Moscow sought both to reach an accommodation on the issue and to "avoid<br>
serious collisions in relations with the West" over it. That spirit of<br>
modest cooperation carried over into bilateral talks in New York between<br>
Washington and Moscow. Although the two sides failed to resolve differences<br>
on Iraq and the former Yugoslavia, Primakov and U.S. secretary of state<br>
Warren Christopher did announce an important missile defense agreement. They<br>
also found common ground on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and on<br>
continued Russian participation in the Bosnian peacekeeping force. Following<br>
a meeting with U.S. president Bill Clinton on September 28, Primakov<br>
described Washington's policy toward Russia as "balanced" and said it was<br>
based on equality and mutual advantage.<br>
<p>
Talking Tough<br>
	During talks with NATO defense chiefs in Norway on September 26, Russian<br>
defense minister Igor Rodionov crafted his response to enlargement much as<br>
Primakov had done in New York: Rodionov underscored Moscow's continued<br>
opposition to enlargement while declaring that the alliance's plans would<br>
not prevent Russia from cooperating with it in Bosnia and elsewhere. In<br>
Moscow, however, anti-enlargement rhetoric had already displayed a much<br>
harder edge. On September 24, Aleksandr Lebed was quoted by a British<br>
newspaper as saying that Russia would slap economic sanctions on U.S. and<br>
German companies if NATO expanded. He was particularly scathing about<br>
Germany, comparing Bonn's post-unification policies to the construction of a<br>
"Fourth Reich" and accusing Germany of wanting to dominate all of Central<br>
and Eastern Europe. A day later, Lebed took on the U.S., intimating that<br>
Washington was considering missile attacks against Russia and warning<br>
bombastically that Moscow did not fear a full-scale war with the U.S. Later,<br>
on September 28, President Yeltsin demanded that NATO conclude a political<br>
treaty with Russia before expanding, a proposal that was endorsed by<br>
Rodionov in remarks on October 1. Rodionov also issued a strong warning that<br>
NATO expansion might cause Moscow to reconsider its adherence to the<br>
Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty.<br>
<p>
Russia's Army: Anticipating a "Hot October?" <br>
	The highly politicized battle over NATO enlargement was paralleled inside<br>
Russia by a deepening conflict over Russia's armed forces. Mounting salary<br>
and payments arrears in the armed forces -- as in other sectors of the<br>
Russian economy -- had over several months increased resentments among<br>
uniformed and civilian employees of Russia's Defense Ministry. Civilian<br>
employees launched a protest in Moscow on September 19, and there were<br>
concerns that regular military personnel might follow them into the streets.<br>
Defense Minister Rodionov, already engaged in a bitter battle with the<br>
government over the draft 1997 budget, complained repeatedly about the<br>
army's financial woes and threw his support behind the civilian protest. But<br>
Lebed raised the political stakes higher still. On September 25, he alleged<br>
that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was deliberately holding back<br>
funding earmarked for the military in order to weaken the armed forces and<br>
undermine Rodionov (a Lebed ally). Lebed also charged that underfinancing<br>
had humiliated the army to the point where an "armed mutiny" was an<br>
immediate possibility. Lebed's remarks bordered on the incendiary and<br>
appeared, in Russia's current context, to reflect political aspirations<br>
beyond those of simply ensuring the welfare of military personnel.<br>
<p>
TWO POST-IMPERIAL REARGUARD ACTIONS<br>
<p>
The smoldering struggle over the spoils of empire entered an active phase at<br>
opposite ends of what used to be the Soviet Union. And while Russia was<br>
handed a success in its political competition with the West for influence in<br>
the Baltic region, it suffered a setback in the military and, in a broader<br>
sense, cultural conflict with local forces on the fringe of Central Asia. <br>
<p>
NATO Expansion off Course in Baltics<br>
	In the Baltic region, it befell NATO's leading power to announce and defend<br>
a decision to postpone sine die the start of procedures to admit Estonia,<br>
Latvia and Lithuania to the alliance. Surprisingly, it was the Pentagon that<br>
bore the brunt of what was essentially a political decision. U.S. defense<br>
secretary William Perry and other Defense Department officials argued<br>
publicly  that the Baltic states were "not yet" eligible for admission<br>
mainly because they were militarily unable to come to the aid of NATO<br>
members if necessary, and because they had "disputes with Russia" over the<br>
treatment of ethnic Russians within their borders. The same officials were<br>
quoted as arguing that the Baltic states had little reason to worry about<br>
being consigned to a "gray" security area," since Sweden and Finland seemed<br>
not to be unduly worried that they too belonged to a gray area outside NATO.<br>
The State Department, apparently content to take a back seat on this issue,<br>
nevertheless referred to the problem of ethnic Russians as a potential<br>
"crisis" in a policy address by the Secretary of State, prompting the OSCE<br>
envoy to Estonia to disagree publicly and point out that the human rights of<br>
that population were not being violated. <br>
	The State Department presaged the decision to postpone the Baltic accession<br>
to NATO by offering in early September a Baltic Action Plan credited to<br>
Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott. It suggested some economic, political and<br>
public relations measures as apparent substitutes for security guarantees in<br>
the Baltic region, and offered no commitments or schedules regarding Baltic<br>
accession to the alliance. The Baltic states politely waved BAP off. <br>
	To be sure, the shelving of Baltic accession to NATO in late September was<br>
accompanied by promises to assist the Baltic states in their efforts to<br>
qualify for membership. The omens that preceded the decision somewhat<br>
amortized its shock effect on the Baltic states. However, the reasons cited<br>
in support of the decision were received in the Baltic states and beyond<br>
even more critically than the decision itself. Rebuttals pointed out that<br>
NATO's enlargement, proceeding from the principle of indivisible security,<br>
must take into account not only the countries' level of readiness but also<br>
their security needs; that the countries' immediate military readiness had<br>
not been a requirement for admission when NATO was founded; and that member<br>
countries achieved such readiness as a result of being admitted to the<br>
alliance. Baltic officials also pointed out that the central European<br>
countries slated to become members of the alliance do not currently meet<br>
Perry's readiness criterion either. <br>
	The second rationale, referring to disputes between the Baltic states and<br>
Russia, not only ignored the findings of international organizations which<br>
have found no human rights problems in connection with the treatment of<br>
Russians in the Baltic states. It unwittingly gave Moscow a reason to go on<br>
heating up ethnic and border issues, just as Moscow has in its efforts to<br>
discourage NATO enlargement in the Baltic region. The timing of the<br>
announcement, on the morrow of Perry's talks with Russian defense minister<br>
Rodionov, was also awkward. It did not even placate official Moscow, where<br>
the announcement was apparently seen as vindicating Moscow's stonewalling<br>
and bluffing. Within days, the deputy director of the USA Institute,<br>
Moscow's leading foreign policy think-tank, warned that Russia might occupy<br>
the Baltic states militarily if NATO admitted them to the alliance.<br>
	The Baltic states reacted with a solemn statement in which their three<br>
presidents jointly reiterated that only early accession to NATO could<br>
guarantee their freedom and requested the alliance to take "the clearest<br>
possible stand" on Baltic security. The presidents pledged their countries<br>
to intensify efforts to canvas support for their accession to NATO, develop<br>
bilateral security cooperation with NATO countries, and make "the sacrifices<br>
necessary" to upgrade their own forces. These eloquently expressed<br>
intentions could not obscure the fact that NATO's enlargement had veered off<br>
course in the Baltic region.<br>
<p>
Russia's Grip Over Tajikistan Threatened<br>
	Ensuring that other powers do not step in to fill the power vacuum left by<br>
the USSR has been a fundamental aim of Russian foreign policy since 1991. In<br>
Tajikistan, these efforts have begun to unravel recently. In mid-September,<br>
the Tajik opposition routed superior but clearly unmotivated government<br>
forces in Garm, the narrow middle section of Tajikistan which connects the<br>
western and eastern parts of the country. The operation was credited to<br>
field commanders Mirzohoja, Ahmadbek and Muhammadruzi, who prevailed not<br>
only against Tajik government commanders but also against Russian forces.<br>
The insurgents established a compact territorial base in part of Garm,<br>
drawing closer to their goal of cutting Dushanbe, in the west of the<br>
country, off from the opposition's eastern strongholds. A provisional truce<br>
with the government enshrined the opposition's gains. United Tajik<br>
Opposition (UTO) leader Saidabdullo Nuri announced that the opposition had<br>
no intention of introducing legal changes -- an apparent reference to<br>
Islamic Shariat law -- in its first "liberated area." That announcement was<br>
meant to banish the specter of "Islamic extremism" which Moscow and Dushanbe<br>
conjure up to justify their war effort. <br>
	To offset the reverses in Garm and regain the initiative in other areas,<br>
the Russian military command in Tajikistan and the government in Moscow<br>
pressed into service what passed for the Afghan government in Kabul.<br>
Comprised mainly of Afghan Tajiks, embattled in its own capital and<br>
controlling only a small part of the country, the Kabul government had been<br>
drifting for some time toward an alliance with Russia as its only chance of<br>
remaining in office and containing the offensive of the Taliban movement.<br>
During the month of September, senior Russian military and diplomatic<br>
officials agreed with Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani and prime<br>
minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar on military cooperation against the UTO. The<br>
UTO had long used sanctuaries in Afghanistan's ethnic Tajik areas along the<br>
border with Tajikistan, tolerated by the Kabul leaders who had neither the<br>
intention nor the means to challenge them. It is still unclear what changed<br>
their mind, other than Moscow's increasing support and possible promises of<br>
military and financial assistance. Given their record of resistance to the<br>
Soviet army in the name of Islam, it may have been a difficult decision for<br>
the Kabul leaders to side with the immediate successor to that army against<br>
the Islamic resistance movement of their Tajik kinsmen on the border.<br>
	Pacts signed in mid-September by Russian generals with Kabul's commanders<br>
provided for a 25-kilometer-wide "security zone" on the Afghan side of the<br>
Afghan-Tajik border. Coordinating with Russian border troops, Kabul's forces<br>
were to interdict the passage of UTO detachments from Afghanistan into<br>
Tajikistan and catch them in the crossfire. Moreover, Kabul's troops were to<br>
attack UTO sanctuaries in that zone. In other words, the Afghan government<br>
was to stab Tajikistan's opposition in the back. Russian officials in<br>
Tajikistan and Moscow made optimistic public statements about the military<br>
benefits of their new alliance with the Rabbani-Hekmatyar group.<br>
	The Moscow-Kabul alliance with its implicit anti-Taliban edge signified the<br>
beginning of Moscow's return to Afghanistan in its old role as a<br>
power-broker. It appeared to stem from a decision in Moscow to switch to a<br>
forward defense of Tajikistan by establishing a defense line inside<br>
Afghanistan, enlisting one Afghan party to help hold that line, and<br>
supporting that Afghan party against its rival. Considered in retrospect,<br>
the decision appeared to reflect an intelligence fiasco of the kind that<br>
plagued Russian forces in the Chechnya war. The decision grossly<br>
underestimated the force of the Taliban, a mere fortnight before they<br>
captured Kabul; overestimated the Kabul leaders' capacity to resist, let<br>
alone to deliver on their commitments to Russia; and may even have been<br>
counterproductive to Kabul itself by forcing it to divert precious military<br>
resources to the Tajik border instead of staking everything on holding onto<br>
Kabul. In any event, the one-time resistance leaders did mount several<br>
attacks on the UTO in the security zone, to public accolades in Moscow and<br>
Dushanbe, before being routed from the capital on September 27 by the<br>
victorious Taliban.<br>
	This development is forcing Russia to recast its strategy in the region.<br>
With its options in Tajikistan narrowing, Moscow may at last get serious<br>
about pressuring its Kulyab clan allies into a power-sharing arrangement<br>
with the opposition first, and with the Soviet-era ruling clans in Leninabad<br>
region second.  As regards Afghanistan, the policy debate in Moscow has<br>
barely begun, but two conflicting options seem to be emerging. One option,<br>
championed by National Security Chief Aleksandr Lebed, argues that the<br>
Taliban will continue their northward thrust into ex-Soviet Central Asia,<br>
and recommends drawing a line of forward defense deep in northern<br>
Afghanistan, in alliance with the remaining Rabbani-Hekmatyar forces under<br>
Afghan Tajik commander Ahmad Shah-Masood and with the Afghan Uzbek forces of<br>
Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum. The other option, espoused by Foreign Minister<br>
Yevgeny Primakov and apparently the majority view at the moment, discounts<br>
the prospect of a Taliban advance into Central Asia and recommends exploring<br>
a modus vivendi with the Taliban and its main supporter, Pakistan. <br>
	The newly independent states of Central Asia will undoubtedly express their<br>
views in the next few days. Among these countries, the one with the<br>
strongest cards to play is Uzbekistan which has influence in sizable areas<br>
of Tajikistan and Afghanistan, a large if obsolete military arsenal, and<br>
links with Dostum. Uzbek and other leaders may well reach consensus on a<br>
core agenda. They seek both to secure their countries' secular orientation<br>
and to deny Moscow an opportunity to reestablish regional hegemony under the<br>
guise of combating "Islamic fundamentalism." The way to accomplish both<br>
purposes can be found only in regional solidarity. <br>
	Such solidarity must include Pakistan. That country holds the key to Afghan<br>
peace and is pivotal to the planned multi-billion dollar UNOCAL-Delta gas<br>
pipeline from Central Asia via Afghanistan to the Indian Ocean, which would<br>
significantly weaken Russia's stranglehold on Central Asian mineral exports. <br>

GAZPROM DENIES REPORTS OF CONFLICT WITH GOVERNMENT. Russia's natural gas<br>
giant, Gazprom, in which Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin holds an<br>
important stake, yesterday denied that it had come into conflict with the<br>
Russian government over unpaid taxes. (Interfax, October 3) The reports were<br>
carried by all major Russian and western news media, including the Monitor.<br>
(See Monitor, October 3) While admitting that the government had frozen the<br>
bank accounts of some of its subsidiaries, Gazprom attributed the action to<br>
a misunderstanding that had since been cleared up. It accused western<br>
agencies of carrying the report out of a desire to undermine the company on<br>
the eve of its first international share offering. <br>
<p>
CHERNOMYRDIN CRITICIZES NATO; ADDRESSES CHECHNYA. Russian prime minister<br>
Viktor Chernomyrdin jumped on the anti-NATO bandwagon on October 2,<br>
suggesting to reporters in Geneva that the Western alliance should put its<br>
enlargement plans on hold and focus instead on improving relations with<br>
Russia. Chernomyrdin, who seems intent on carving out a greater foreign<br>
policy role for himself during Boris Yeltsin's illness, was in Geneva for<br>
talks with Swiss foreign minister -- and OSCE chairman -- Flavio Cotti.<br>
Chernomyrdin also praised the work of the OSCE mission to Chechnya, which is<br>
headed by a Swiss diplomat, and said Russia favors the extension of the<br>
mission's mandate. (Itar-Tass, October 2)<br>
<p>
FINANCE MINISTRY ON MILITARY BUDGET. Russian deputy prime minister and<br>
finance minister Aleksandr Livshits told a press conference at the Russian<br>
embassy in Washington on October 2 that at least 90 percent of the<br>
military's unpaid back wages --which he estimated at 10 trillion rubles --<br>
were covered in the government's proposed 1997 budget. Testifying before the<br>
State Duma yesterday, First Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Petrov said<br>
that the 100 trillion rubles budgeted for the armed forces would fully meet<br>
their requirements. Defense Minister Igor Rodionov had said this amount<br>
won't even come close. (RFE/RL, Itar-Tass, 3 October 1996)<br>
<p>
AZERBAIJAN SENTENCES FIRST BATCH OF OMON PLOTTERS. The military bench of<br>
Azerbaijan's Supreme Court has sentenced 17 former special police officers<br>
to prison terms ranging from 8 to 15 years for their participation in the<br>
March 1995 coup attempt against President Haidar Aliev's government. The<br>
officers belonged to the OMON unit in the Agdam district on the Karabakh<br>
front. The Court is separately trying 37 officers of the Baku OMON unit<br>
involved in that same coup attempt. (Turan, Interfax, October 2 and 3)<br>
<p>
SPOILED FOR CHOICE. A by-election is to be held in Tula, south of Moscow,<br>
where voters last December chose Gen. Aleksandr Lebed as their parliamentary<br>
representative. Lebed resigned his seat after joining the Yeltsin team. Now<br>
two other well-known generals have declared their intention of contesting<br>
the seat -- former defense minister Pavel Grachev and former presidential<br>
security chief Aleksandr Korzhakov. Yeltsin sacked both men in the summer<br>
but, as they say, old soldiers never die. (Interfax, October 2)<br>

<p>
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT SIGNS AGREEMENT WITH CHECHEN OPPOSITION LEADER. The<br>
Russian government is pressing ahead with the Chechen peace settlement<br>
despite strong opposition from parliament and even from some members of the<br>
government itself. Only a day after Duma members accused Security Council<br>
Secretary Aleksandr Lebed of "treason" for his efforts to end the Chechen<br>
conflict, Lebed was present when Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin met in<br>
the Russian government building with Chechen opposition leader Zelimkhan<br>
Yandarbiev. Also taking part were Nationalities Minister Vyacheslav<br>
Mikhailov, Prime Minister of the pro-Moscow government Nikolai Koshman, and<br>
the head of the OSCE mission in Chechnya, Tim Guldimann. The two sides<br>
signed a statement agreeing to set up the Joint Commission envisioned in the<br>
Khasavyurt accords, giving fresh momentum to peace efforts that have stalled<br>
since the accords were signed on August 31. The Joint Commission will be<br>
responsible for overseeing the withdrawal of Russian troops and the<br>
reconstruction of the war-ravaged republic, including the rebuilding of<br>
housing and restoration of the public health service. It will meet in Grozny<br>
under Russian and Chechen co-chairmanship at least once a week and its<br>
decisions will be binding. (Itar-Tass, Interfax, AP, October 3; Nezavisimaya<br>
gazeta, October 4) <br>
<p>
The fact that Chernomyrdin signed yesterday's agreement means that Moscow<br>
has for the first time officially recognized the Khasavyurt accords. Until<br>
now, the Russian government had refused to express unambiguous approval of<br>
the accords, and their legal basis had been questioned. Yesterday Russia's<br>
Constitutional Court also declined to consider an appeal by 93 Duma deputies<br>
to pronounce on the constitutionality of the Khasavyurt accords, asserting<br>
that the appeal was "incorrectly formulated". (Interfax, October 3) In a<br>
statement after yesterday's meeting with Yandarbiev, Chernomyrdin stressed<br>
that the agreement made no mention of Chechnya's status. But he emphasized<br>
that there had been no change in the position of his government -- that<br>
Chechnya remains an integral part of the Russian Federation.<br>
<p>
YELTSIN PRAISES AND REBUKES LEBED. The government's change of heart came<br>
after Russia's hospitalized president, Boris Yeltsin, held his first meeting<br>
with Aleksandr Lebed in eight weeks (that is, since before the Khasavyurt<br>
accords were signed). The same day, Yeltsin addressed the nation in the<br>
first of a new series of radio talks. For the first time, Yeltsin expressed<br>
unambiguous approval of Lebed's activity in Chechnya. (Radio Rossiya,<br>
October 3) Soon after, according to government sources, Chernomyrdin agreed<br>
-- "at the urgent request of Aleksandr Lebed" -- to meet with Yandarbiev.<br>
(Interfax, October 3) <br>
<p>
Yesterday's meeting between Yeltsin and Lebed is nonetheless said to have<br>
been tense. While Yeltsin gave his approval to the continuation of the peace<br>
negotiations with Yandarbiev, saying they must be conducted "with tact and<br>
intelligence," Lebed seized the opportunity to complain about Yeltsin's<br>
decision to appoint his former security adviser, Yury Baturin, to oversee<br>
top-ranking military appointments -- a job Lebed wanted himself. Lebed<br>
threatened to resign over the issue, but still did not get his way.<br>
(Nezavisimaya gazeta, October 4) Lebed's rebellion prompted Yeltsin in a<br>
television interview later in the day to issue a public rebuke, saying Lebed<br>
should act like a team player and cooperate with the government. This public<br>
dressing down will not sweeten relations between the two men, who are said<br>
to dislike one another. Their antipathy dates from their first meeting last<br>
May, three weeks before the first round of the presidential elections.<br>
Yeltsin invited Lebed to the Kremlin for a two-hour conversation, and Lebed<br>
was surprised and puzzled when Yeltsin ended the meeting after 29 minutes.<br>
"Yeltsin could not stand any more. Their characters are too similar," a<br>
journalist noted. (Selskaya zhizn, June 22) Yeltsin rules by the tried and<br>
true method of divide and rule, keeping his aides in a permanent state of<br>
imbalance, and this is bound to irk Lebed, who is beholden to Yeltsin for<br>
his present job but nothing else.<br>
<p>
NUCLEAR RESEARCHER FORMALLY INDICTED FOR ESPIONAGE. Aleksandr Nikitin, the<br>
retired Russian naval officer charged with treason for his co-authorship of<br>
a report on the nuclear hazards created by Russia's Northern Fleet, has been<br>
formally indicted. Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) announced on<br>
October 2 that it had concluded its investigation into the case, and that<br>
Nikitin, who had been working for the Norwegian environmental group Bellona,<br>
has been charged with espionage and the passing of state secrets. The crux<br>
of the case is the FSB's assertion that Chapter 8 of the Bellona report --<br>
which deals with accidents on nuclear-powered submarines -- contains<br>
classified information procured by Nikitin. Nikitin has also been charged<br>
with illegally using his military identification card to access classified<br>
documents at a St. Petersburg military installation. (Itar-Tass, October 2)<br>
According to an October 2 Bellona press release, the charges against Nikitin<br>
are based solely upon his work for Bellona. <br>
<p>
Nikitin was arrested by FSB agents in February of this year and, despite<br>
numerous appeals, has been kept in solitary confinement since that time. The<br>
Bellona report, of which Nikitin was one of three main authors, is entitled<br>
"The Russian Northern Fleet: Sources of Radioactive Contamination." Released<br>
by the Oslo-based environmental group in late August, it warns of the<br>
potential environmental hazards posed by the fleet's nuclear legacy and says<br>
that international efforts are required to avoid a future "Chernobyl in slow<br>
motion." The report also notes that Nikitin's arrest was part of a broader<br>
campaign of intimidation organized by the FSB to hinder Bellona's research<br>
and to stop publication of the report. On August 30 Amnesty International<br>
officially declared Nikitin a "prisoner of conscience" and cast his case as<br>
a test of Russia's independent judiciary. (See Monitor, September 4)<br>
<p>
Bellona claims that its report is based solely upon open sources and<br>
contains no state secrets. According to the group's October 2 statement, an<br>
expert committee from Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry concurred with that<br>
assessment in a decision rendered on September 26. But the FSB was said to<br>
have disregarded that finding and turned instead to a contrary report by<br>
Russia's General Staff. Bellona has also taken issue with a dubious FSB<br>
claim that nuclear submarine accidents and safety do not fall under the<br>
purview of Russian laws on ecological safety. (Bellona Foundation press<br>
release, October 2)<br>
<p>
RODIONOV BRINGS IN SOME OF HIS OWN MEN. President Boris Yeltsin --<br>
undoubtedly at the urging of Defense Minister Igor Rodionov -- has finally<br>
started to make some personnel changes in top Defense Ministry and General<br>
Staff posts. In an October 2 decree he named Lt. Gen. Grigory Kasperovich --<br>
the chief of staff of the Urals Military District -- to head the Defense<br>
Ministry's personnel directorate. This post had not been vacant, but it was<br>
a foregone conclusion that Col. Gen. Evgeny Vysotsky, personnel czar for<br>
disgraced former defense minister Pavel Grachev, was on the way out.<br>
Kasperovich had commanded a division in Rodionov's 40th Army in Afghanistan. <br>
<p>
In other changes, Maj. Gen. Georgy Oleynik was named to fill the long-vacant<br>
post of head of the ministry's  budget and financing directorate. Maj. Gen.<br>
Gennady Zolotukhin will take charge of administrative affairs and head the<br>
armed forces legal service, while Lt. Gen. Leonid Ivashov becomes the new<br>
head of the main directorate for international military cooperation. Lt.<br>
Gen. Nikolay Pishchayev, who had headed the Strategy Department of the<br>
General Staff Academy while Rodionov was the Commandant, was named first<br>
deputy head of the General Staff. This is probably a case of Rodionov<br>
wanting to have someone he can trust in the top echelons of the General<br>
Staff until he can put his own man in the top position. Col. Gen. Mikhail<br>
Klishin was named to head the main organizational-mobilization directorate<br>
of the General Staff, a position he had been filling on a temporary basis.<br>
Other important posts remain vacant. They include the chief of the Main<br>
Operations Directorate of the General Staff and the Defense Ministry's Main<br>
Educational Work Directorate. (Interfax October 2,1996, Kommersant-daily,<br>
October 3, 1996)<br>
<p>
THE BALTIC STATES<br>
<p>
LATVIAN-RUSSIAN BORDER TALKS ALSO DEADLOCKED. Riga and Moscow announced<br>
yesterday that a second round of bilateral talks on border delimitation,<br>
held on October 1 and 2 in Moscow, ended in disagreement, as had the first<br>
round in April. Latvia seeks recognition of the validity of the 1920<br>
Russian-Latvian peace treaty and the legal continuity of the Latvian state<br>
after the Soviet occupation. Moscow insists -- as Russian Foreign Ministry<br>
spokesman Gennady Tarasov restated yesterday -- that the treaty was voided<br>
by Latvia's "joining the Soviet Union." Tarasov described the Latvian<br>
parliament's recent declaration, which reaffirmed the state's legal<br>
continuity after 1940, as "anti-Russian." The spokesman warned that Russia<br>
will proceed unilaterally to demarcate the border on the ground if Latvia<br>
insists on a Russian recognition of the 1920 treaty. (BNS, Itar-Tass,<br>
October 2 and 3)<br>
<p>
Latvia's Abrene district, measuring some 2,000 square kilometers, was<br>
incorporated into the Russian Federation following the Soviet occupation of<br>
Latvia. The situation at the Latvian-Russian talks parallels that of the<br>
deadlocked Estonian-Russian talks, in which Estonia is prepared to recognize<br>
Russia's annexation of two small Estonian border areas if Russia recognizes<br>
the validity of the 1920 Russian-Estonian peace treaty and thus the legal<br>
continuity of the Estonian state.<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
SCRIPT DISPUTE FLARES UP IN TRANSDNIESTER. Moldovan president Mircea Snegur<br>
has appealed officially to international groups for help in reopening<br>
Moldovan schools closed by Transdniester authorities in retaliation for the<br>
teaching of the native language in the Latin script rather than in Cyrillic.<br>
Snegur's appeal for intercession with the Transdniester authorities was<br>
directed toward the OSCE, Russia, and Ukraine--the three mediators in the<br>
Transdniester settlement talks -- and also to international human rights<br>
organizations. In the latest incidents in the script dispute, two more<br>
Moldovan schools were seized in recent days by Transdniester military police<br>
and Russian Cossacks. (Basapress, Flux, October 1 through 3) <br>
<p>
Imposition of the Cyrillic script on non-Slavic peoples was a major feature<br>
of forced russification in the former USSR. Transdniester represents the<br>
only known case in which local Russians have successfully opposed the use of<br>
a non-Cyrillic script by the native population for its own language.<br>
Transdniester Russians are a ruling minority comprising 25 percent of the<br>
region's population.<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
OSCE QUESTIONS ARMENIAN ELECTION OUTCOME; MANUKIAN TURNS TO COURT. In its<br>
final report on Armenia's presidential election, the OSCE Observer Mission<br>
ascertained "numerous irregularities including some very serious breaches of<br>
the election law;" collusion among precinct electoral commissions and the<br>
incumbent president's proxies; unlawful presence of the police at voting<br>
stations; ballot box stuffing; and refusal by the government-controlled<br>
electoral commissions to consider opposition complaints. The mission<br>
particularly  emphasized that more than 22,000 votes could not be traced to<br>
any registered voters, and another 21,000 ballots are missing and<br>
unaccounted for. Noting that President Levon Ter-Petrosian passed the 50<br>
percent threshold by only 22,000 votes, the mission concluded that those<br>
disparities alone could raise questions about the results of the election.<br>
The mission called for legal sanctions against the officials responsible,<br>
but stopped short of  recommending cancellation of the election.<br>
<p>
The United Opposition's candidate, Vazgen Manukian, resurfaced from hiding<br>
and requested the Constitutional Court to order either an overall recount of<br>
the votes, a repeat voting if the records of the September 22 first-round<br>
balloting have been destroyed, or the holding of a run-off election among<br>
the top two candidates, as provided for by law.<br>
<p>
Several opposition parties whose leaders competed in last month's election,<br>
ultimately rallying behind Manukian, issued statements calling for an<br>
independent review of the returns and calling attention to the authorities'<br>
attempts to suppress political pluralism. The leaders of those parties are<br>
mostly under arrest or wanted, while their parliamentary deputies have been<br>
deprived of immunity, their offices sealed, and their newspapers suspended.<br>
The most influential of those parties, Dashnaksutiun, has been banned.<br>
(Snark, Noyan-Tapan, Interfax, Western agencies, October 2 and 3)<br>
<p>
Any official revision of the returns looks highly unlikely. International<br>
pressure is lacking and the authorities have the internal situation well in<br>
hand. The defense minister has said on national television that he and his<br>
fellow-ministers for internal affairs and state security would "never accept<br>
Manukian even if he had won 100 percent of the vote."<br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
REGIONAL SUMMIT EXAMINES AFGHANISTAN DEVELOPMENTS. The presidents of four<br>
Central Asian countries, accompanied by their defense and security<br>
ministers, are meeting with Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and<br>
other top Russian officials in Kazakhstan's capital Almaty today. The<br>
summit, initiated by Russia's hospitalized president (or in his name), will<br>
review the military and political situation in the region following the<br>
Taliban movement's victory in Afghanistan. <br>
<p>
The Russian and Central Asian governments differ both among and within<br>
themselves in assessing developments in Afghanistan. In Moscow, security<br>
chief Aleksandr Lebed has warned of a Taliban push into Central Asia and<br>
called for drawing a line of resistance against "Islamic Fundamentalism"<br>
inside northern Afghanistan. Lebed urges propping up Afghanistan's runaway<br>
president, Burhanuddin Rabbani, and providing Russian support for ethnic<br>
Uzbek and ethnic Tajik forces commanded by Abdul Rashid Dostum and Ahmad<br>
Shah-Masood, respectively. Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov has<br>
sought to defuse Lebed's alarmist view and called for exploring a modus<br>
vivendi with the Pushtun-based Taliban. Col. Gen. Boris Gromov, the last<br>
commander of Soviet forces in Afghanistan, has discounted the notion that<br>
the Taliban have the strength to push into Central Asia. <br>
<p>
Uzbek president Islam Karimov's initial reaction has been one of alarm at<br>
the possible spread of "Islamic extremism" northward. Karimov hastened to<br>
inspect the Uzbek-Afghan border yesterday. But Uzbek foreign minister<br>
Abdulaziz Komilov, on a visit to London, offered an assessment similar to<br>
Primakov's, as did Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev. Tajik president<br>
Imomali Rahmonov predictably called for sending Russian and Central Asian<br>
military reinforcements to the Tajik-Afghan border. Turkmen president<br>
Saparmurad Niazov, whose country shares a long border with Afghanistan, has<br>
stayed away from the Almaty meeting on the grounds that Turkmenistan has<br>
chosen permanent neutrality. (Russian and Western agencies, October 3)<br>

YELTSIN BEGINS FIRESIDE CHATS... Russian president Boris Yeltsin, who is<br>
expected to be out of the public eye for several months while undergoing<br>
heart surgery, plans to keep in touch with the population through regular<br>
radio addresses. The first was broadcast this morning. Yeltsin assured<br>
listeners that he remains in full control and that his hospitalization does<br>
not mean that the government is paralyzed. (BBC World Service, October 3)<br>
The row that erupted yesterday between the government and Russia's gas giant<br>
suggests the opposite. (For details, see Perspective)<br>
<p>
...AS HIS POPULARITY TUMBLES. The Russian president has slipped to third<br>
place in the listing of Russia's most influential politicians, published<br>

Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in first place and Security Council<br>
Secretary Aleksandr Lebed in second. (Nezavisimaya gazeta, October 1)<br>

SOUTH KOREAN DIPLOMAT MURDERED IN VLADIVOSTOK. On the evening of October 1<br>
an official from the South Korean consulate was murdered by unknown<br>
assailants outside his apartment in Vladivostok, Russia's foreign ministry<br>
announced yesterday. The 54-year-old South Korean diplomat had been in<br>
charge of North Korean affairs, and the death prompted some media<br>
speculation of a possible North Korean link. (AP, Itar-Tass, October 2)<br>

RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
LEBED UNDER FIRE OVER CHECHEN PEACE... Security Council Secretary Aleksandr<br>
Lebed got a hostile reception at yesterday's session of the Russian Duma,<br>
the first since the summer recess. Lebed, summoned to give an account of the<br>
Khasavyurt peace accords he signed with Chechen chief of staff Aslan<br>
Maskhadov at the end of August, faced taunts of "Traitor!" and "Shame!"<br>
Accusing Lebed of high treason, Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov described<br>
the Khasavyurt accords as "a fiction ... aimed at separating Chechnya from<br>
Russia in a way that is most favorable to Chechnya and most humiliating for<br>
Russia." (Interfax, October 2) When he first went to Chechnya in August,<br>
Lebed vowed to name those to blame for the Chechen conflict. But at his<br>
press conference on August 16, Lebed demanded the resignation of only one<br>
man -- Kulikov. The Interior Minister appealed to President Yeltsin, who<br>
instructed him to remain in his post. Lebed reconciled himself to the<br>
president's decision and, until now, the two men avoided further polemics.<br>
Kulikov's speech of yesterday may therefore signal a change in position<br>
toward Lebed's peacemaking efforts. The fact that deputies from the<br>
Communist  and Liberal-Democratic factions attacked Lebed's activities<br>
yesterday was no surprise. But even deputies belonging to the pro-government<br>
"Russia is Our Home" faction refused to express even indirect support for<br>
Lebed's achievements. The only deputy to speak in his support was the leader<br>
of the Yabloko faction, Grigory Yavlinsky. (Interfax and other Russian<br>
media, October 2) <br>
<p>
Presidential chief-of-staff Anatoly Chubais also indirectly criticized<br>
Lebed. Addressing a press conference in Moscow yesterday, Chubais made a<br>
number of snide remarks about Lebed and deplored the fact that the former<br>
general had already begun his "presidential campaign." (Interfax, October 2)<br>
In a further sign of a hardening of Moscow's position on the Chechen<br>
question, sources in the office of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said<br>
there was "no room in the prime minister's schedule" for a meeting with<br>
Chechen opposition leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiev, expected to arrive in Moscow<br>
at any moment. (RIA, October 2) When Yandarbiev originally planned to come<br>
to Moscow on September 23 (the visit was postponed due to Yandarbiev's<br>
illness), Chernomyrdin expressed his willingness to confer with him. <br>
<p>
...BUT QUITS WHILE HE'S AHEAD. Lebed did not take these attacks lying down.<br>
He told the Duma that he had completed the mission entrusted to him by<br>
Yeltsin in July and brokered a peace in Chechnya. He acknowledged that many<br>
difficult military and political problems remained to be resolved, but said<br>
it was now time for others to undertake the task of reconstructing the<br>
war-torn republic. (BBC World Service, October 2) This was a very clever<br>
move on Lebed's part. By putting the ball in Chernomyrdin's court, Lebed<br>
placed the prime minister in a no-win situation. As usual, Lebed is playing<br>
to the gallery. He can now take the credit for the Chechen peace, while<br>
government leaders will have either to open negotiations with the Chechen<br>
opposition and continue Lebed's work, thereby endorsing the policies that<br>
yesterday they criticized so harshly, or risk being seen as responsible if<br>
the situation in Chechnya deteriorates and hostilities resume. But Lebed<br>
suffered one setback yesterday, when Yeltsin named Yuri Baturin to head the<br>
presidential commission on higher military appointments. (Interfax, October<br>
2) Lebed, who replaced Baturin as presidential security adviser in June,<br>
complained two weeks ago that he had been promised the post but that Kremlin<br>
opponents were trying to take it away from him. Apparently they have succeeded. <br>
<p>
RUSSIAN GAS GIANT IN WRANGLE OVER TAX CLAMPDOWN. A row erupted yesterday<br>
when Gazprom, Russia's second largest company and the world's biggest<br>
producer of natural gas, accused the Russian government of freezing the bank<br>
accounts of some of Gazprom's subsidiaries to punish it for unpaid taxes.<br>
Gazprom is furious for two reasons. First, it says it is not to blame for<br>
the tax arrears: as a result of the government's failure to resolve the<br>
crisis of inter-enterprise debt, Gazprom is owed much more by its customers<br>
(49 trillion rubles) than it owes to the state (15 trillion). Second, the<br>
government could not have chosen a worse moment to attack Gazprom: next<br>
week, the company is to launch a long- awaited international share-offering<br>
in which it will invite foreign investors to stump up $400 million for a 1<br>
percent stake in the company. The government's move threatens to destroy<br>
market confidence and undermine the share-offer, which has already been<br>
postponed once this year because of uncertainty provoked by Russia's<br>
presidential elections. (BBC World Service, Financial Times, October 2) <br>
<p>
The government's action was loudly deplored by Gazprom chairman Rem<br>
Vyakhirev, who alleged that the government is preparing inventories of the<br>
property of several Gazprom subsidiaries and threatening to auction them off<br>
if the company does not pay its taxes. This is the latest spiral in war of<br>
words between Gazprom and the Russian government. Earlier this week,<br>
Vyakhirev fired off an angry letter in which he called on the Russian<br>
parliament to protect Gazprom from government plans to break up a number of<br>
natural monopolies (Gazprom, the unified power grid, and Russia's single<br>
railway network) into separate, independent companies. Complaining that the<br>
government was acting at the behest of the International Monetary Fund,<br>
which has made breaking up the monopolies a condition of its $10.2 billion<br>
extended loan to Russia, Vyakhirev said Gazprom would be broken up "over his<br>
dead body." (Nezavisimaya gazeta, October 2) <br>
<p>
The government's bad timing, and the fact that it has moved against Gazprom<br>
at a moment when all the ministers most responsible for the Russian economy<br>
are in Washington meeting with the IMF and World Bank, prompted speculation<br>
in Moscow that something murky was afoot. Although the Russian government is<br>
under heavy IMF pressure to improve its tax collection procedures, there was<br>
speculation that the clampdown might have been secretly initiated by<br>
top-level Gazprom managers who oppose the sale of shares to foreign<br>
investors and would prefer Gazprom to remain in state hands. The plot<br>
thickened when Finance Minister Aleksandr Livshits, who is supposed to be<br>
responsible for taxation, told journalists in Washington that he had no<br>
knowledge of the decision to move against Gazprom. (BBC World Service,<br>
October 2) Conspiracy theories apart, the row adds further weight to<br>
impressions that, in President Yeltsin's absence, the Russian government is<br>
a house deeply divided against itself pursuing a multiplicity of frequently<br>
conflicting aims.<br>
<p>
RODIONOV INDICATES NO QUICK SHIFT TO ALL-VOLUNTEER FORCE. Russian Defense<br>
Minister Igor Rodionov told reporters on October 1 that it will be<br>
impossible for the military to transition to an all-volunteer force by the<br>
year 2000 as President Boris Yeltsin had directed it to do. Like most of the<br>
problems currently facing the military, the issue is one of money. According<br>
to Rodionov, the armed forces will simply lack the funding necessary even to<br>
attract enough contract volunteers to maintain a military of 1.2 million<br>
soldiers -- the level it is to reach in 1997. A concrete military reform has<br>
been drawn up, he continued, but it does not envisage an all-volunteer force<br>
until the year 2005. And even this new target date will be met if-and only<br>
if-the necessary funds are provided.<br>
<p>
In a wide-ranging  press conference Rodionov ticked off a number of the most<br>
serious financial shortfalls facing his ministry: it needs 9.7 trillion<br>
rubles to feed military personnel in accordance with approved standards, but<br>
will receive only 7.6 trillion; another 9.6 trillion is required to clothe<br>
and supply the troops but only 2.6 trillion is budgeted; civilian employees<br>
will be due 13.4 trillion in wages yet only 6.8 trillion is planned in the<br>
budget. He explained that even cutting the forces costs money. To disband a<br>
motor-rifle regiment requires 48 billion rubles while the cost to maintain<br>
it for a year amounts to only 14 billion. <br>
<p>
Rodionov could not have been more blunt when he said that if the defense<br>
budget is not corrected "Russia may lose its armed forces as an integral and<br>
viable state structure with all the consequences that this may have." Yet,<br>
he contrasted this dire warning with a remarkably sanguine judgment of the<br>
problems facing the military: "the situation is, on the whole, satisfactory,<br>
controllable and manageable." All indications are that he will need more<br>
support from the government and the Federal Assembly than his predecessor<br>
received if it is to remain that way for long. (Krasnaya zvezda, October 2,<br>
1996)<br>
<p>
CIVILIAN DEFENSE SECTOR WORKERS PREPARE PROTEST ACTIONS. The Russian Defense<br>
Ministry's civilian workers are preparing for a nation-wide strike beginning<br>
November 1 over their unpaid wages. Their trade union held a plenum on<br>
October 1 and placed more than one million members in a "pre-strike<br>
condition." The union's chairman, Spartak Arzhavkin, said that civilians<br>
working for the military, like those in uniform, had not been paid for 3 or<br>
4 months. The government owes the military more than 6 trillion rubles while<br>
the Defense Ministry owes its civilians and service personnel nearly 10<br>
trillion rubles in back wages, Arzhavkin said. (Itar-Tass, RIA 1 October 1996) <br>
<p>
Workers at the plants that build and dismantle Russian nuclear weapons are<br>
also fed up working without pay. Several dozen from the Arzamas-16 federal<br>
nuclear center, the Mayak facility in Chelyabinsk, and weapons plants in<br>
Penza and Moscow will picket the Finance Ministry today and tomorrow.<br>
(Komsomolskaya pravda, October 2) After a two-day strike at the Sokol<br>
military communications systems plant in Belgorod, meanwhile, regional and<br>
city authorities agreed to provide funds to pull the enterprise out of its<br>
current financial crisis. The help will allow the company to start paying<br>
some of its back wages. Workers at Sokol also went on strike on August 19<br>
and threatened to stop traffic on the Moscow-Simferopol highway. They<br>
claimed not to have been paid for 8 months. (Itar-Tass 1 October 1996)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
UKRAINE APPOINTS HIGH-PROFILE ENVOY TO NATO. The Ukrainian government has<br>
appointed Col. Gen. Kostyantyn Morozov as the country's representative to<br>
NATO and, concurrently, to the West European Union. Morozov carries the<br>
official title of "principal coordinator for Ukraine-NATO cooperation on<br>
military issues." Born in 1944, Morozov served from 1991 to 1993 as the<br>
first defense minister of independent Ukraine and played a key role in the<br>
creation of Ukrainian armed forces.(Interfax-Ukraine, UNIAN, October 1)<br>
<p>
The establishment of this Ukrainian representation in Brussels marks a<br>
milestone in Ukraine's quest for a special relationship with NATO. It<br>
entails political consultations and military cooperation short of membership<br>
and also reflects NATO's and the European Union's stated awareness of<br>
Ukraine's central role in the post-Cold War geopolitics of Europe. Kiev also<br>
regards its nascent special partnership with NATO and WEU as a key element<br>
in European security and one that does not affect Ukraine's neutral status. <br>
<p>
RUSSIAN BLACK SEA FLEET COMPLETES MAJOR EXERCISE; PLANS ITS FUTURE. Russian<br>
Black Sea Fleet commander Admiral Viktor Kravchenko and the Fleet's<br>
chief-of-staff, Vice-Admiral Pyotr Svyatashov, announced in separate<br>
statements in Sevastopol and Krasnodar that the Fleet had completed its main<br>
annual exercise, conducted off Crimea. Some 40 warships and auxiliary<br>
vessels, land-based aviation, coastal artillery and missile batteries, and<br>
marine infantry units were involved. The 12-day exercise featured submarine<br>
chasing, torpedo and artillery firing, marine infantry landings, and mock<br>
battle operations by naval squadrons. <br>
<p>
The commanders stated that the Fleet's strength will be set at approximately<br>
100 warships and 30,000 men, to be divided into a western grouping based in<br>
Sevastopol and an eastern grouping based on Russia's Caucasus coast. They<br>
expect several new surface ships and submarines this year, among them the<br>
Moskva guided missile cruiser (whose completion is being funded by Moscow<br>
mayor Yuri Luzhkov). The commanders called for tasking the Russian fleet<br>
with defense of both Russia's and Ukraine's maritime borders -- jointly with<br>
the Ukrainian fleet -- and also urged that it "operate in the interests of<br>
the CIS." (Interfax-Ukraine, UNIAN, October 1 and 2; Krymskie izvestiya<br>
cited by Nezavisimaya gazeta, October 1) <br>
<p>
Ukraine will not willingly accept any such common defense arrangements,<br>
intended in part to confer a bilateral or multilateral veneer on Moscow's<br>
quest for long-term naval basing rights in Ukraine. Plans to develop the<br>
fleet in Crimea are contingent on the outcome of Russian-Ukrainian<br>
negotiations. The question of finding a suitable base on the Caucasus coast<br>
remains unresolved. Novorossiisk is the only viable choice from the navy's<br>
point of view, but it is probably incompatible with the Russian Ministry of<br>
Economy's plan to dedicate Novorossiisk to exports of Caspian oil in the<br>
event that Moscow succeeds in having that oil diverted to Russia.<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
GEORGIA WARNS IT MAY ASK RUSSIAN TROOPS TO LEAVE. The Georgian parliament<br>
yesterday adopted a decision in which it officially declared Russia's<br>
political mediation between Tbilisi and Abkhazia "unsatisfactory," and held<br>
Russian "peacekeeping" forces responsible for shielding the planned Abkhaz<br>
elections and thus legitimizing the ethnic cleansing of Georgians. The<br>
decision stipulates that all Georgian-Russian relations, specifically<br>
including Tbilisi's execution of the unratified friendship treaty and the<br>
unratified agreement on Russian military basing rights in Georgia, will be<br>
contingent upon Russian support for the restoration of Georgia's territorial<br>
integrity. The parliament will conduct annual reviews of these issues to<br>
determine the appropriateness of Russia's military presence in Georgia.<br>
President Eduard Shevardnadze is instructed to form a special state<br>
delegation for discussing these issues with the Russian side and reporting<br>
back to parliament by December 10. The commission is also instructed to<br>
request the U.S., Britain, and Germany to join efforts at reaching a<br>
political settlement of the Abkhazia problem.<br>
<p>
The decision was drafted and submitted by Shevardnadze's ruling Union of<br>
Georgia's Citizens. During the debate, speakers described Russia as "an<br>
organizer of the conflict in Abkhazia" and said that Moscow was<br>
co-responsible for ethnic cleansing by dint of its military assistance to<br>
the Abkhaz in the 1992-93 war and the practical effects of its peacekeeping<br>
operation since 1994. (Interfax, October 2) The parliament's decision was<br>
preceded by a series of warnings delivered by Shevardnadze and other<br>
Georgian officials, exasperated by Moscow's policy of freezing the situation<br>
on the ground in Abkhazia's favor. Abkhazia's and South Ossetia's decisions<br>
to call elections under the de facto protection of Russian troops was the<br>
final straw. Yeltsin's incapacitation also helped precipitate Tbilisi's<br>
decision. Georgian leaders expect a period of paralysis in Russia's policy<br>
and are unwilling to go along with a further, and seemingly open-ended,<br>
postponement of long overdue decisions on Abkhazia and South Ossetia.<br>

LEBED ASSAILS NATO. Russian Security Council secretary Aleksandr Lebed<br>
yesterday compared NATO to a "fist" pointed at Russia and charged that the<br>
alliance's enlargement could return Europe to Cold War-style confrontation.<br>
Lebed also suggested that the West would be better off boosting aid to<br>
Russia rather than devoting large sums of money to enlargement. (Itar-Tass,<br>
October 1)=20<br>
<p>
ZYUGANOV ALLEGES FRAUD IN ROSTOV ELECTION. Russian Communist party leader<br>
Gennady Zyuganov says he suspects that vote-rigging in last Sunday's<br>
gubernatorial election enabled the pro-Yeltsin incumbent, Vladimir Chub, to<br>
defeat his Communist challenger, Leonid Ivanchenko. (NTV, October 1) Voting<br>
was slowed by stormy weather that knocked out power to some polling stations<br>
and  hindered public transport. At 42 percent voter turnout was low, a<br>
development that usually favors Communist candidates. Yet Chub won 62<br>
percent of the vote to Ivanchenko's 32 percent. (Itar-Tass, September 30)=20<br>
<p>
LABOR UNREST CONTINUES. Coalminers in Vorkuta, inside the Arctic Circle,<br>
staged a one-day warning strike and a protest rally yesterday. Some have not<br>
received  wages since February. Adding political demands to economic ones,<br>
demonstrators  called for the resignation of both President Yeltsin and his<br>
government. (Itar- Tass, Interfax, October 1) Miners in the Kuzbass in<br>
western Siberia are  threatening to block the Transiberian railway if their<br>
arrears are not paid by  October 5. A nationwide miners' strike has been set<br>
for November 5. (Interfax, October 1)=20<br>
<p>
RUSSIA OFFERS JAPAN JOINT ANTIMISSILE SYSTEM. A senior unnamed Russian<br>
diplomat in Tokyo suggested on October 1 that Russia and Japan create a<br>
joint regional antimissile defense system, one that could possibly also be<br>
hooked up to a similar U.S. system. The diplomat said that the Japanese are<br>
aware of the Russian offer but have, as yet, not responded to it. A Russian<br>
diplomat also said that Russia sees no military threat from Japan and<br>
intends to expand bilateral contacts in the defense field. (ITAR-TASS, 10<br>
October 1996)<br>
<p>
NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS AT FACILITIES IN BELARUS, UZBEKISTAN. Programs to upgrade<br>
the security and control of nuclear materials at research facilities in<br>
Belarus and Uzbekistan have been completed, according to an October 1 U.S.<br>
Department of Energy press release. Safeguards were installed at the Sosny<br>
Scientific and Technical Center in Belarus, and the Uzbekistan Academy of<br>
Sciences Institute of Nuclear Physics. Both facilities store<br>
highly-enriched=96or weapons grade=96uranium. Similar projects are underway=<br>
 in<br>
more than 40 other facilities in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine.<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
CHECHEN LEADERS SAID TO TAKE A HARDER LINE. There is as yet no news about<br>
when Chechen leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiev will make his long awaited visit to<br>
Moscow, though his aide is already there to prepare for the visit.<br>
Yandarbiev was originally expected on September 23, but the visit was<br>
postponed because of illness. Kremlin sources said they believed the illness<br>
to be "diplomatic," caused by disagreements within the Chechen leadership.<br>
The same disagreements were believed to lie behind the decision of<br>
Yandarbiev and Chechen chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov not to attend the<br>
session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg<br>
last month. Chechen field commanders are said to have accused Yandarbiev and<br>
Maskhadov of being too accommodating in their negotiations with Russia and<br>
reproached them for backing down to Russian demands over the enforcement of<br>
Islamic law in the republic. (Argumenty i fakty news agency, September 17;<br>
see Monitor, September 24)<br>
<p>
Now, if Russian news reports on the situation in Chechnya are to be<br>
believed, the advocates of an uncompromising policy towards Moscow have<br>
prevailed within the Chechen opposition. According to Interfax, Maskhadov<br>
told local television yesterday that, as soon as Russian troops have left<br>
Chechen territory, "We will build an Islamic state... We have no need of a<br>
coalition government appointed by Moscow." "When our victory is complete,"<br>
Maskhadov reportedly continued, "our constitution will be based on Islamic<br>
law." (Interfax, October 1) Russian news reports also say that Yandarbiev<br>
has gone back on earlier agreements to exchange prisoners of war without<br>
conditions and is now demanding that Russia first pay $100,000 compensation<br>
to each Chechen family that lost a member in the war. (Argumenty i fakty<br>
newspaper, October 2)<br>
<p>
Russian reports of events in Chechnya have frequently proven unreliable.<br>
Especially given the recent developments in Afghanistan, those lobbies<br>
within the Russian leadership that oppose Aleksandr Lebed's peacemaking<br>
efforts and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Chechnya have an interest<br>
in painting a lurid picture of events in the republic. The true position of<br>
the Chechen leadership may become clear only when Yandarbiev makes his<br>
delayed visit to Moscow.<br>
<p>
LEBED AND KORZHAKOV STRIKE UP ALLIANCE. Aleksandr Korzhakov continues to<br>
make headlines in the Russian media. Once President Yeltsin's closest<br>
confidant and  reputed drinking buddy, the former head of the Presidential<br>
Security Service was ignominiously sacked in June. Now, rumors of a new<br>
alliance with Kremlin security chief Aleksandr Lebed, originally dismissed<br>
as lurid speculation, have been  confirmed by both men. (Komsomolskaya<br>
pravda, September 24; Izvestiya, September 26; Kommersant-daily, September<br>
28)  What brings them together? First, a shared desire for power. Lebed<br>
makes no  secret of his desire to be Russia's next president. Korzhakov has<br>
more modest  ambitions: he wants to run for the Duma in the Tula<br>
constituency vacated when  Lebed moved from parliament to the Kremlin.<br>
Second, a shared hatred of Yeltsin's chief-of-staff, Anatoly Chubais.<br>
Chubais was instrumental in Korzhakov's ouster, while Lebed sees him as the<br>
main obstacle to his presidential ambitions. Third,  neither man any longer<br>
feels any personal loyalty to Yeltsin. The alliance makes sense of reports<br>
received in June that it was Korzhakov who  brought Lebed onto the Yeltsin<br>
team after Lebed won 15 percent of the vote in  the first round of the<br>
presidential election. Lebed's call to his voters to  switch their votes to<br>
Yeltsin helped the president to win the second round.=20<br>
<p>
What can each man do for the other? Korzhakov wants to get back into the<br>
corridors  of power. He has hinted that he could give Lebed information on<br>
the corrupt  dealings and secret bank accounts of Kremlin leaders that would<br>
be invaluable  ammunition for Lebed in an election campaign. Former Yeltsin<br>
aide Sergei Filatov  has confirmed that Korzhakov's security service kept<br>
the presidential staff  under constant surveillance. If Lebed is to become<br>
president, he will need more than the high media profile  and popular<br>
support that at present are his trump cards. He will certainly need<br>
finance. The Russian media are now speculating that this is where<br>
Korzhakov's  help could be crucial. Korzhakov's connections with the<br>
secretive arms trading  company Rosvooruzheniye, reputed to be highly<br>
profitable, has been identified as a potential source of campaign funding<br>
for Lebed. (NTV, September 29) Lebed looked wet behind the ears when he<br>
arrived in the Kremlin in June but he  has since displayed not only a<br>
ruthless ambition but a remarkable ability to  learn. As he said this week<br>
in another context: "Nobody ever gives anyone power. You have to take it"<br>
(Interfax, October 1)<br>
<p>
YELTSIN ORDERS EXAMINATION OF ARMY'S FINANCIAL WOES... Amid reports of<br>
growing disgruntlement in the ranks of Russia's armed forces, President<br>
Boris Yeltsin yesterday took steps to address the army's worsening financial<br>
situation. During a meeting with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin at the<br>
Central Clinical Hospital near Moscow, Yeltsin ordered the convening of a<br>
special meeting of the Cabinet in order to discuss funding problems in the<br>
armed forces. He also asked that Defense Minister Igor Rodionov chair what<br>
will be the first session of Russia's Defense Council. (Reuter, Interfax,<br>
ORT, October 1) The Defense Council was created by Yeltsin with much fanfare<br>
on July 25. It's stated purpose at the time was to oversee Russian military<br>
reform, but many in Moscow viewed it more as an effort to clip the wings of<br>
Security Council secretary Aleksandr Lebed. (See Monitor, July 30) A liberal<br>
Yeltsin aide, former national security advisor Yury Baturin, was named<br>
secretary of the new body. Baturin said in July that the council would<br>
likely meet for the first time in mid-September.=20<br>
<p>
Yesterday's meeting follows warnings from military leaders that mounting<br>
wage and payment arrears in the armed forces have undermined discipline and<br>
could even lead to a loss of control over military personnel. Lebed has been<br>
among those sketching the most alarmist scenarios. Last week he compared the<br>
current situation in the armed forces to that which prevailed in 1917 and<br>
warned that the military personnel could soon mutiny. (See Monitor,<br>
September 26) Although Rodionov attempted yesterday to dispel such concerns<br>
of rebellion, he did describe the situation in the army as a crisis, and he<br>
appealed publicly to Yeltsin for the government to repay the backlog of<br>
wages. (Reuter, October 1)<br>
<p>
RODIONOV LINKS NATO ENLARGEMENT TO CFE TREATY. Rhetoric from Russia's<br>
Defense Ministry on the subject of NATO enlargement grew hard again<br>
yesterday as defense chief Igor Rodionov warned that Moscow would view<br>
enlargement as a violation of the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty<br>
and might cease reductions of its own military forces in response. In<br>
comments to the press the Russian Defense Minister said that Russia's<br>
"military security will be diminished" in the event of NATO enlargement<br>
because "the numerical correlation of weapons and hardware will shift to the<br>
advantage" of NATO. The enlargement of NATO will also change the<br>
geopolitical situation in Europe and begin the drawing of new dividing lines<br>
on the continent, Rodionov said. Such arguments are hardly new, but they are<br>
perhaps Rodionov's most explicit and public endorsement of this line of<br>
thinking since his appointment as defense minister on July 17.=20<br>
<p>
The confrontational tone of his remarks yesterday also appeared to contrast<br>
with the relatively cordial tone that Rodionov had adopted during recent<br>
talks with NATO defense chiefs in Norway. There Rodionov reiterated Moscow's<br>
opposition to enlargement but also its willingness to continue working with<br>
the Western alliance regardless of its plans. (See Monitor, September 27)<br>
Rodionov also threw his weight yesterday behind an earlier demand by Boris<br>
Yeltsin that NATO conclude a political treaty with Russia before it embarks<br>
upon expansion. "First, there must be a treaty between Russia and NATO and<br>
only later can there be discussion of a project to expand the bloc,"<br>
Rodionov declared. (UPI, Interfax, Itar-Tass, October 1)=20<br>

THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
UKRAINE HIT BY RUSSIAN VAT. Officials of Russia's CIS Cooperation Ministry<br>
and customs service said yesterday that the 20 percent Russian value-added<br>
tax on goods imported from Ukraine went into effect on October 1. Moscow's<br>
move ignores Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma's appeal to Russian prime<br>
minister Viktor Chernomyrdin at their September 28 talks in Moscow to<br>
postpone implementation of the VAT pending further talks. (Interfax-Ukraine,<br>
Itar-Tass, October 1). Moscow had agreed to suspend the measure for the<br>
month of September but is now charging the VAT retroactively on Ukrainian<br>
goods that entered Russia last month. President Boris Yeltsin decreed the<br>
tax in August for the stated purpose of generating budget revenue and<br>
protecting Russian producers, despite the Russian-Ukrainian free trade<br>
agreement. The measure is expected to reduce severely Ukrainian exports to<br>
Russia.<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
ARMENIAN OPPOSITION APPEALS FOR INTERNATIONAL INTERCESSION. A large group of<br>
wives and mothers of Armenian opposition leaders arrested or wanted by the<br>
authorities have issued an appeal to international organizations. It calls<br>
for an independent review of the presidential election returns, the release<br>
of those arrested, and the reinstatement of civil liberties in Armenia.<br>
Attached to the appeal is a partial list of those opposition leaders under<br>
arrest or wanted by the authorities. The list contains 38 names, including<br>
several presidential candidates in the first round of the election, several<br>
of their campaign managers, most of the opposition bloc's parliamentary<br>
deputies, and opposition members of the Central Election Commission.<br>
(Noyan-Tapan, September 30 and October 1)<br>
<p>
Western diplomats in Yerevan estimate the number of arrests at 250. The<br>
arrests came in the wake of an outbreak of violence generated by Armenia's<br>
disputed presidential election. Incumbent president Levon Ter-Petrosian was<br>
declared the winner with 52 percent of the vote in the first round amid<br>
indications of fraud. The Armenian Communist Party, which also opposes the<br>
government but is not a part of the opposition bloc, has withdrawn its eight<br>
deputies from parliament in protest against the repression. The parliament<br>
is now virtually devoid of any opposition.<br>
<p>
AZERBAIJANI ISLAMISTS REQUEST RELEASE OF DETAINED ACTIVISTS. A Committee for<br>
the rights of arrested Islamic activists held a news conference in a mosque<br>
close to Baku yesterday. The group appealed to President Haydar Aliev to<br>
approve on medical grounds the release on bail of nine Party of Islam<br>
activists who were detained last spring. The group, whose leading figure is<br>
Haji Alikram, were said to have contracted diseases while in detention. They<br>
are accused of anti-state activity, sending disciples to Iran, and espionage<br>
in favor of a "foreign state" -- another apparent reference to Iran. (Turan,<br>
October 1) The Party and the committee are not legally recognized. The<br>
detention of this group has been a sore point in Azerbaijan-Iran relations.<br>
Iran has also criticized Azerbaijan's constitution and general choice of<br>
secular development, which the Azerbaijani Islamists seek to change.<br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
INCREASING UZBEK INFLUENCE IN AFGHANISTAN AND TAJIKISTAN. Russian president<br>
Boris Yeltsin yesterday instructed Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to<br>
call a meeting of the presidents of the Central Asian countries to discuss<br>
the situation in the region following the downfall of the Kabul government.<br>
Also yesterday, a high-level interagency meeting at the Foreign Ministry in<br>
Moscow examined the "destabilization of the CIS southern borders" and called<br>
for immediate peace talks among all Afghan forces. Both sets of talks, if<br>
held, would see an unprecedented increase in the influence of Uzbekistan,<br>
and of the ethnic Uzbek factor, in northern Afghanistan and Tajikistan<br>
following the Taliban movement's capture of Kabul.<br>
<p>
Afghanistan's departed leaders, President Burhanuddin Rabbani and Prime<br>
Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, are being sheltered by the ethnic Uzbek<br>
warlord, General Rashid Dostum, who firmly controls Uzbek-inhabited northern<br>
Afghanistan and has links with Uzbekistan. Dostum had supported the Soviet<br>
occupation of Afghanistan, but later stayed out of the struggle between the<br>
Kabul government and the Taliban and is now strongly placed to influence the<br>
balance of power. Moreover, the downfall of the Kabul government--dominated<br>
by Afghan Tajiks -- deprives Moscow of its recent ally in containing the<br>
northward advance of perceived Islamic fundamentalism, and correspondingly<br>
increases Moscow's interest in enlisting Dostum as a possible ally.<br>
<p>
Russia's chief security official, Aleksandr Lebed, yesterday disclosed the<br>
whereabouts of Afghanistan's departed leaders and called for Russia to<br>
support them -- and Dostum. The goal would be to forge a common front of<br>
ethnic Uzbeks and Tajiks in northern Afghanistan against the Pathan-based<br>
and Pakistan-supported Taliban. Lebed professed to expect Taliban claims on<br>
Uzbek territories and suggested that the Taliban would also join the Tajik<br>
opposition in Tajikistan in an effort to overcome Russia's border troops<br>
there and to sweep northward. (Interfax, Itar-Tass, October 1)<br>
<p>
Uzbekistan's policy is crucial to developments not only on Afghanistan's<br>
northern fringe but also in Tajikistan's western region, where the<br>
population is also solidly Uzbek. Anti-Dushanbe mutinies in that region have<br>
tied down the regime's forces, in effect benefiting the opposition<br>
insurgency in the east. Recently, the ethnic Uzbek warlord Ibod Boimatov<br>
recaptured control of the industrial city of Tursunzade in western<br>
Tajikistan after returning there from Uzbekistan. That action added to the<br>
strong combination of cards that Uzbekistan has to play in the increasingly<br>
fluid situation in Afghanistan and Tajikistan.<br>

NEWS:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN PARLIAMENTARIANS QUERY KHASAVYURT ACCORDS. Ninety-three members of<br>
the Russian parliament (three more than the required minimum) are calling on<br>
Russia's Constitutional Court to declare whether or not the Khasavyurt<br>
accords are in line with the Russian Constitution. (Interfax, September 30)<br>
The accords, signed by Security Council Secretary Aleksandr Lebed and<br>
Chechen chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov on August 31, omit all mention of<br>
Chechnya's status. But their references to international norms might be<br>
interpreted as implying that Chechnya is a sovereign state rather than, as<br>
the Russian Constitution rules, part of the Russian Federation.<br>
<p>
FEDERAL TROOPS MAY LEAVE CHECHNYA EARLY. The withdrawal of federal forces<br>
from Chechnya is proceeding as planned and may be completed ahead of<br>
schedule, according to military sources cited by Itar-Tass and Interfax. The<br>
first phase is to be concluded today, October 1, when the last of the<br>
military units not belonging to the North Caucasus Military District (NCMD)<br>
is scheduled to leave the republic. Then the withdrawal of NCMD units will<br>
begin. Military sources say that, if the withdrawal continues at its present<br>
pace, it will be completed by the end of October. The only exception<br>
concerns airborne troops which, though not subordinated to the NCMD, will<br>
remain in Chechnya to guard installations at Khankala, the main federal base<br>
outside Grozny. (Itar-Tass, September 29; Interfax, September 30)<br>
<p>
CONCERN OVER "CHECHEN SYNDROME." Concern is growing over outbreaks of<br>
"Chechen syndrome" among Russian veterans of the war in Chechnya, with a<br>
rise in suicides and random violence among Russian servicemen who saw action<br>
in Chechnya. (NTV, September 29) The suicide rate for the armed services has<br>
long been higher than that for the Russian population as a whole, but it was<br>
generally assumed that the official data were artificially inflated to cover<br>
up the deaths of victims of hazing. Meanwhile, some 1,400 Russian troops are<br>
at present listed as missing in action in Chechnya. (Interfax, September 29)<br>
<p>
NORTH KOREA RILED BY ARMS DELIVERY TO SOUTH KOREA. North Korea reacted<br>
sharply on September 30 to the recent delivery of Russian BMP-3 combat<br>
fighting vehicles and T-80 tanks to South Korea. The North Korean news<br>
agency called these actions "reckless and irresponsible" and a "serious<br>
military-political problem which jeopardizes peace and security in the<br>
Korean peninsula." It also described the Russian actions as a crime and said<br>
that if they continued "there will be a need to square accounts." Russia is<br>
delivering the arms to South Korea as part of a deal to pay back the Soviet<br>
Union's large debt. Although the South Koreans have traditionally relied on<br>
American military equipment, they plan to equip a test battalion with<br>
Russian arms. (ITAR-TASS, 30 September)<br>
<p>
NEW AGENCY TO OVERSEE DEFENSE FINANCING. Russian prime minister Viktor<br>
Chernomyrdin has ordered the creation of a commission to coordinate<br>
government activities related to the financing of Russia's army and other<br>
power ministries. To be headed by First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir<br>
Potanin, the commission is also to analyze the budgetary requests submitted<br>
by these ministries. Among the members of the new commission are Deputy<br>
Defense Minister Andrei Kokoshin and Defense Industry Minister Zinovy Pak.<br>
(Interfax, September 28) Chernomyrdin's order comes amid a growing payments<br>
crisis in the power ministries. <br>
<p>
MALAYSIAN LEADER CONDEMNS MOSCOW FOR BLOODSHED IN CHECHNYA. The Prime<br>
Minister of Malaysia charged in a UN speech on September 27 that Russia has<br>
"shut the gates of mercy on the Chechens and with rockets and bombs has<br>
killed indiscriminately and with appalling brutality." In a speech that also<br>
included criticism of the U.S. for its recent air strikes in Iraq, Mahathir<br>
Mohamad accused the UN of turning a blind eye to the bloodshed unleashed by<br>
Russia in Chechnya. (UPI, September 27)<br>
<p>
KAZAKHSTAN SIGNS NUCLEAR TEST BAN TREATY. At UN headquarters in New York<br>
yesterday Kazakhstan's foreign minister, Kasymzhomart Tokayev, signed the<br>
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on behalf of his government. Kazakhstan, which<br>
gave up an inherited Soviet nuclear arsenal, becomes one of six former<br>
Soviet countries to sign the treaty. In 1991 Kazakhstan closed the<br>
Semipalatinsk testing range. (Itar-Tass, September 30)<br>
<p>
AZERBAIJANI PLOTTERS ON TRIAL. Azerbaijan's Supreme Court today begins the<br>
trial of 37 former officers of the Internal Affairs Ministry's OMON<br>
special-purpose regiment. They are charged with high treason for having<br>
participated in a March 1995 coup attempt led by the deputy minister and<br>
OMON commander, Col. Rovshan Javadov. The OMON was dissolved and the<br>
officers were arrested after the failure of the coup, during which Javadov<br>
was killed. (Interfax, September 30)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
MOSCOW SIDESTEPS CONFRONTATION DESPITE DIFFERENCES ON NATO ENLARGEMENT.<br>
Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov admitted to journalists in New<br>
York on September 28 that NATO enlargement appears to be inevitable. The<br>
Kremlin's chief diplomat also restated both Russia's opposition to NATO's<br>
plans and Moscow's threat to reconsider its adherence to the Conventional<br>
Forces in Europe Treaty (CFE) should expansion become a reality. Primakov<br>
nevertheless said that he does not foresee a new Cold War in Europe over the<br>
issue, and he expressed his hope that tensions related to NATO would not<br>
undermine relations with the U.S. Indeed, following a meeting with U.S.<br>
president Bill Clinton, Primakov expressed satisfaction over what he<br>
described as Washington's "balanced policy" toward Russia and its<br>
willingness to build relations with Moscow on the basis of equality and<br>
mutual advantage. He also suggested that U.S. officials had thanked Moscow<br>
for successfully urging restraint on Iraqi leaders during the recent<br>
hostilities in the Persian Gulf. Primakov's relatively cheerful assessment<br>
of relations between the two countries was a far cry from that which he used<br>
in the immediate aftermath of the Iraqi crisis, when he accused Washington<br>
of, among other things, seeking to dominate the post-Cold War world.<br>
(Itar-Tass, Interfax, September 29)<br>
<p>
On the issue of NATO enlargement, talks in Bergen, Norway between NATO<br>
defense chiefs and Russian defense minister Igor Rodionov also ended in a<br>
deadlock. U.S. defense secretary William Perry said following his return<br>
from Norway that the atmosphere had been a positive one during Rodionov's<br>
first meeting with his NATO counterparts, and that Western defense chiefs<br>
were cheered by Rodionov's pledge that Moscow will continue to work with<br>
NATO despite the alliance's expansion plans. But Perry also admitted that<br>
the two sides had made no progress whatsoever on a much hoped for political<br>
agreement between Moscow and NATO. He suggested that Russian leaders seem<br>
inclined to stonewall that issue until they are "satisfied on the outcome of<br>
NATO enlargement." (AP, September 29; Interfax, September 30)<br>
<p>
RECRIMINATIONS OVER VICTORY OF COMMUNIST-BACKED CANDIDATES. The Kremlin is<br>
licking its wounds following the election victories of Communist-backed<br>
governors in Amur oblast on September 22 and Leningrad oblast on September<br>
29. The September 29 reelection of the Kremlin-backed incumbent governor in<br>
Rostov oblast seems to be little comfort. The narrow defeat (by a few<br>
hundred votes) of the Kremlin-backed governor of Amur oblast was not<br>
unexpected, since Amur has long been seen as the Far East's "red island."<br>
But the loss of Leningrad oblast to the Communist-backed Vladim Gustov is<br>
being seen as a more serious defeat. Gustov got 53.4 percent of the vote<br>
while incumbent Aleksandr Belyakov received 31.7 percent. <br>
<p>
Mutual recriminations are the order of the day. Sergei Filatov, the former<br>
Yeltsin aide charged with identifying and fostering Kremlin-friendly<br>
candidates, blamed the defeated incumbent, saying that after five years in<br>
office Belyakov had grown complacent and pompous. Filatov reproached<br>
Belyakov for announcing, only a week before the election, that he and the<br>
governor of St. Petersburg had agreed to merge their two territories by the<br>
year 2001. This was a tactless move, Filatov said, since the benefits to the<br>
city are more obvious than those to the oblast. (RTR, September 30)<br>
Belyakov's response was that he lost because only old people turned out to<br>
vote. <br>
<p>
The victorious Gustov did not contest this analysis, but said it underlined<br>
the fact that Belyakov's economic policies had hurt the disadvantaged. He<br>
pointed out that such people have votes and are worthy of consideration by<br>
politicians. Gustov insisted that, though he is a former member of the CPSU,<br>
he now belongs to no political party and that in the recent campaign he had<br>
the backing not only of the communists but also of Grigory Yavlinsky's<br>
Yabloko party and even of the Greens. He insisted that his policies would be<br>
dictated not by politics but solely by economic considerations and that he<br>
would not be taking orders from the Communist party. (NTV, September 30)<br>
Aleksandr Kazakov, first deputy head of the presidential administration and<br>
a close ally of Anatoly Chubais, was the only Moscow figure who did not<br>
depict the Leningrad results as a disaster. Taking Gustov at his word,<br>
Kazakov said that while Gustov's election would inevitably be depicted as a<br>
victory for the communists, Gustov was a professional with whom the Kremlin<br>
could do business. (RTR, September 30) <br>
<p>
ANOTHER CALL TO THE COLORS. With the prestige and morale of the armed forces<br>
at an all-time low, the Russian military -- along with the other "power<br>
structures" -- is about to embark on another semi-annual draft of<br>
18-year-old men. President Boris Yeltsin's decree of September 29 said that<br>
the goal of the October-December call-up was to induct 215,000 new<br>
conscripts, compared with the 200,200 inducted in the spring. Only 65<br>
percent of those drafted will serve in the traditional armed forces. The<br>
rest will be parceled out to some 23 other ministries and agencies,<br>
including such seemingly unimportant ones as the Federal Road Building Agency.<br>
<p>
It is likely that more youths than ever before will evade the draft. Some<br>
31,000 young men were said to have failed to report for duty in the last<br>
call-up and the rate has been steadily climbing since 1989. Moreover, the<br>
majority of those who do show up are not happy about their fate. Recent<br>
polls conducted by the Defense Ministry indicate that more than 50 percent<br>
of recent inductees did not want to continue their service, and one in three<br>
said their parents were absolutely opposed to their military service. Only<br>
10 percent felt they were performing their patriotic duty. Nearly one-third<br>
expressed a fear of being mistreated in the barracks. The new conscript are<br>
also likely to be less healthy and less educated than the military would<br>
like. Recently three out of every ten draftees failed to meet the minimum<br>
physical standards. In 1995, only 3.5 percent of the conscripts had a higher<br>
education and 5.2 percent had been convicted of a crime. (RIA 30 September,<br>
Nezavisimoye voennoye obozreniye 26 September)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
U.S. CONGRESS CALLS FOR WITHDRAWAL OF RUSSIAN TROOPS FROM MOLDOVA. The U.S.<br>
House of Representatives has unanimously adopted a special resolution urging<br>
Russia to withdraw its troops from Moldova. The resolution expresses concern<br>
over Russia's "tergiversation" in implementing the 1994 troop withdrawal<br>
agreement and calls on Russia to carry it out without delay. It also urges<br>
the U.S. State Department to act, both within the framework of U.S.-Russia<br>
bilateral relations and through international institutions, to secure the<br>
withdrawal of the troops. In addition, the resolution reaffirms<br>
"unconditional" support for Moldova's territorial integrity and notes with<br>
approval the willingness of Ukraine to assist in settling the Transdniester<br>
conflict. The U.S. Senate is expected to adopt the resolution this week.<br>
(Flux, Basapress, September 30)<br>
<p>
Prime Ministers Viktor Chernomyrdin and Andrei Sangheli signed the agreement<br>
in October 1994, but Moscow later claimed that implementation requires<br>
ratification by the Duma. A majority in the Duma strongly oppose the<br>
withdrawal and the Russian executive branch has been content to hide behind<br>
the legislature, effectively turning the agreement into a dead letter. The<br>
Council of Europe listed the withdrawal of troops from Moldova among the<br>
conditions for Russia's admission to the CE almost one year ago, and both<br>
branches of the Russian government pledged to comply. But Russia's executive<br>
continues to claim that the withdrawal agreement requires the Duma's<br>
ratification-a condition not stipulated in the agreement itself.<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
ARMED CLASHES ACCOMPANY RIVAL GEORGIAN AND ABKHAZ ANNIVERSARIES. Abkhazia<br>
yesterday celebrated the third anniversary of its 1993 military victory<br>
against Georgia. Several days earlier Georgia had observed its own September<br>
27 Day of Remembrance and Hope, instituted by President Eduard Shevardnadze<br>
to honor the memory of Georgian victims of "ethnic cleansing" in Abkhazia.<br>
On September 27, 1993, Russian-assisted Abkhaz forces captured Abkhazia's<br>
capital Sukhumi, and, as Abkhaz president Vladislav Ardzinba put it at<br>
yesterday's anniversary, "drove the last Georgian occupiers from Abkhaz<br>
territory" three days later.<br>
<p>
The rival observances were accompanied by armed clashes that left dead and<br>
wounded in Abkhazia's Gali and Ochamchira districts. According to the Abkhaz<br>
version of events, the clashes were caused by Georgian military infiltrators<br>
conducting guerrilla operations in the area. The Abkhaz leadership accused<br>
Tbilisi of engaging in "state terrorism" and appealed to the Russian<br>
"peacekeeping" troops to retaliate in accordance with an August, 1996<br>
Russian-Georgian-Abkhaz memorandum envisaging action against "terrorism" in<br>
the security zone. According to Tbilisi, however, the clashes pitted Abkhaz<br>
military and security forces recruited in those two districts against units<br>
recruited in Ardzinba's stronghold Gudauta. The latter group is reported to<br>
be strongly over-represented in the Abkhaz military and security hierarchy,<br>
and is less than fully confident in the loyalty of some Gali and Ochamchira<br>
natives because of their family and religious ties to Christian Georgians.<br>
(Iberia, Interfax, September 28 through 30)<br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
DEFEAT OF KABUL LEADERS SCUTTLES PACT WITH MOSCOW. Tajik presidential<br>
spokesman Zafar Saidov told Russian correspondents yesterday that the defeat<br>
of the Afghan authorities in Kabul may have "destroyed" Moscow's and<br>
Dushanbe's agreement with those authorities to cooperate against the Tajik<br>
opposition on the Tajik-Afghan border. Dushanbe "had hoped to turn that<br>
border into one of peace and friendship" but is now "alarmed by potential<br>
region-wide tremors" following the Taliban movement's capture of Kabul, the<br>
spokesman said. The statement echoes Russian foreign minister Yevgeny<br>
Primakov's and other Moscow officials' expressions of concern. The Russian<br>
Foreign Ministry's Third Asian Department chief, Rashid Hamidulin (as cited)<br>
said yesterday that Moscow lacks accurate information about the latest<br>
developments around Kabul and in northern Afghanistan, and does not yet know<br>
the intentions of the runaway Afghan leaders, President Burhanuddin Rabbani<br>
and Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. They had recently concluded the pact<br>
with Moscow.<br>
<p>
Since Kabul fell, a detachment of Tajik opposition fighters and an Afghan<br>
mujaheddin unit jointly fought their way into Tajikistan from Afghanistan<br>
against Russian border troops and are now operating behind Russian lines.<br>
Over the past two days in the same sector six Russian border guards have<br>
been killed and a Russian helicopter knocked out of action by rocket fire<br>
from Afghan territory. (Interfax, Itar-Tass, September 28 through October 1)<br>

<p>
COMMUNIST ELECTED IN LENINGRAD OBLAST, WHILE INCUMBENT KEEPS HIS POST IN<br>
ROSTOV. Communist-backed candidate Vadim Gusto has been declared the victor<br>
of the gubernatorial election held in Leningrad oblast on Sunday. But the<br>
pro-Yeltsin incumbent governor won the other gubernatorial election held<br>
that day, in Rostov oblast in southern Russia. (Itar-Tass, September 30) In<br>
addition, the Communist candidate has finally been declared the winner of<br>
the disputed gubernatorial election held on September 22 in Amur oblast in<br>
Russia's Far East. The latest results mean that Communists and pro-Yeltsin<br>
candidates are neck and neck in this fall's series of gubernatorial<br>
elections: so far, each side has two victories.<br>
<p>
MOSCOW SIGNALS CONCERN OVER DEVELOPMENTS IN AFGHANISTAN. Russia's Foreign<br>
Ministry issued a statement on September 27 saying that the recent seizure<br>
of Kabul by Taliban rebels would have a destabilizing affect on the region.<br>
The statement also urged the UN to play a more active role in bringing peace<br>
to Afghanistan and -- in an apparent warning to Pakistan -- emphasized that<br>
a key precondition for achieving a settlement is the "exclusion of any<br>
outside interference in internal Afghan matters." (UPI, September 27)<br>
<p>
HIGH-LEVEL RUSSIAN GOVERNMENTAL DELEGATION IN WASHINGTON. Russian first<br>
deputy prime minister Vladimir Potanin is in Washington this week, heading<br>
the Russian delegation to the annual meetings of the World Bank and its<br>
sister-organization, the International Monetary Fund. At the World Bank,<br>
Potanin will discuss conditions for the credit the bank is giving Russia to<br>
reconstruct its coal industry. Also on the delegation are Central Bank<br>
chairman Sergei Dubinin, Finance Minister Aleksandr Livshits, and Economics<br>
Minister Yevgeni Yasin. (Itar-Tass, September 27)<br>
<p>
GRACHEV HOSPITALIZED? Although he was sacked as defense minister on June 18,<br>
Gen. Pavel Grachev remains on active duty in the military. His leave was up<br>
on September 1, but he has yet to reappear in the Defense Ministry -- where<br>
he is to be "at the disposal" of his successor. Currently, Grachev is said<br>
to be a patient of the Third Central Military Clinical Hospital suffering<br>
from an acute case of urolithiasis. A military source, when asked whether<br>
Grachev's illness was a "diplomatic" one, responded that: "He is sick<br>
together with the president." (Kommersant-Daily, 28 September) Earlier this<br>
month it was reported that Grachev had taken a job with an unidentified<br>
commercial firm in Moscow.=20<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
YELTSIN SHOWN ON RUSSIAN TELEVISION WHILE LEBED CALLS ON HIM TO STAND DOWN.<br>
Russian president Boris Yeltsin appeared on Russian television Saturday in<br>
an apparent effort to prove that he is fit enough to work despite his<br>
impending heart operation. Yeltsin was shown in the hospital talking with<br>
Defense Minister Igor Rodionov and was heard to say that NATO should strike<br>
a deal with Russia before embarking on expansion. "We will put the issue<br>
this way. First a deal with Russia and then you tackle the issue of<br>
expanding NATO. They want it the other way around, but that won't work!"<br>
Yeltsin declared with a smile. (RTR, Reuters, September 28) Rodionov was<br>
reporting to Yeltsin on his participation in the recent NATO defense<br>
ministers meeting in Norway.=20<br>
<p>
In an interview published the same day in a popular Moscow newspaper,<br>
Security Council Secretary Aleksandr Lebed said Yeltsin should relinquish<br>
his presidential powers until he has fully recovered from his operation.<br>
(Moskovsky komsomolets, September 28) Lebed said the decision-making<br>
machinery is at a standstill and that this is harming adoption and execution<br>
of policy. "It's not clear whether we have a president or not," he said. "I<br>
would prefer any leader, however temporary, to none at all." Lebed warned<br>
that constitutional procedures for transferring power are dangerously vague<br>
and could open the door for Yeltsin's aides to rule in his absence, using<br>
him as a puppet. On the face of it, Lebed was only saying what many Russians<br>
are thinking. Lebed has stated that he will support Viktor Chernomyrdin when<br>
Yeltsin hands over his powers to the prime minister during his heart<br>
operation. He was not, therefore, calling on Yeltsin to step down in favor<br>
of himself. But the public forum Lebed chose to express his concerns<br>
underlines once again that Lebed is not a Kremlin team player and is<br>
pursuing an agenda of his own.<br>
<p>
NAZRAN CONFERENCE APPROVES CHECHEN PEACE PLAN. Meeting in Nazran, the<br>
capital of Ingushetia, on September 27, the leaders of eight republics and<br>
regions of the north Caucasus expressed approval of the Khasavyurt accords,<br>
signed on August 31 by Aleksandr Lebed and Chechen chief-of-staff Aslan<br>
Maskhadov. Lebed himself was at the meeting, which was presided over by<br>
Ingush president Ruslan Aushev. Also on the agenda was the creation of a<br>
regional security machinery for the peaceful resolution of conflicts in the<br>
North Caucasus. A regional congress will be held in the autumn to hammer out<br>
details. (Itar-Tass, September 27) Aushev expressed concern about the<br>
territorial disputes likely to arise not only if Chechnya secedes from<br>
Russia, but even if it opts to remain within the Russian Federation. (RTR,<br>
September 29) Indeed, Chechnya's borders have never been formally<br>
determined. In the Soviet period they were repeatedly re-drawn, especially<br>
after Stalin's deportation of the Chechens and the Ingush in 1944, and again<br>
after their return in the mid-1950s. As detailed below, Chechnya now has<br>
three major bones of territorial contention: (1) with Ingushetia to the<br>
west, (2) with Dagestan to the east, and (3) with Stavropol krai to the=<br>
 north.=20<br>
<p>
(1) Stalin lumped the Chechens and the Ingush together in a single territory<br>
in 1934, but historically the two peoples have always occupied separate<br>
territories. After Chechnya declared independence in 1991, it unilaterally<br>
established its western border with Ingushetia along the frontier that<br>
divided the Chechen and Ingush territories prior to their 1934 merger. There<br>
were immediate protests by the Ingush, who erected barricades along the<br>
disputed border and complained that Chechnya was claiming land that<br>
historically belonged to the Ingush. The dispute was patched over in 1993<br>
when Chechen and Ingush presidents Dudaev and Aushev agreed for the time<br>
being not to demarcate the frontier between Chechnya and Ingushetia, but the<br>
matter remains to be sorted out.<br>
<p>
(2) Chechnya has a potential conflict over Khasavyurt district, in the<br>
western part of the Dagestan, which is populated predominantly by Chechens.<br>
Once Chechnya's status is established, these Chechens are likely to want to<br>
be united with their brethren across the border. Chechnya might also lay<br>
claim to Dagestan's Aukhovsky district, which was Chechen-settled territory<br>
until 1944 when Stalin deported the Chechens who lived there. There have<br>
been many minor disputes in recent years between Chechens and the Laks and<br>
Avars who moved into the district after the Chechens were deported.<br>
<p>
(3) The resurgence of the Cossack movement is another major potential source<br>
of conflict. Cossacks in northern Chechnya and Dagestan have been demanding<br>
autonomy or that areas where Cossacks are concentrated should be transferred<br>
to Russia proper. These include the Russian-inhabited Naursky and Shelkovsky<br>
districts on the left bank of the River Terek, which formed part of<br>
Stavropol krai from 1944 to 1957.<br>
<p>
CIS DEFENSE INDUSTRIES: PUTTING HUMPTY-DUMPTY BACK TOGETHER AGAIN. The<br>
Soviet military-industrial complex paid no heed to republican boundaries. As<br>
a result, none of the Soviet Union's successor states is self-sufficient in<br>
arms production. Last Friday, representatives from eight CIS countries met<br>
in Moscow to try and reestablish at least some central coordination. The<br>
first meeting of the Intergovernmental Commission on Military-Economic<br>
Cooperation of CIS-Member Countries included participants from Armenia,<br>
Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, Ukraine, and Russia.<br>
Russian defense industries minister Zinovy Pak, who was elected chairman of<br>
the new body, admitted that Russia could only produce 18 percent of its<br>
military needs without the cooperation of suppliers from other CIS countries<br>
-- and it is probably in better shape than the other CIS members. The<br>
commission looked at ways to simplify the settlement of inter-state=<br>
 contracts.=20<br>
<p>
The results of the meeting suggested that Russia plans to use its position<br>
as the dominant military supplier to protect its growing arms export market.<br>
The participants were said to have decided to coordinate their arms export<br>
efforts and to have drawn up "internal rules of conduct." The proposed<br>
rules, which must be approved by the Council of the CIS Heads of Government,<br>
would restrict one of the partners from reexporting military products it had<br>
received from another, and prevent one partner from supplying information<br>
about such products to a third country without written permission from the<br>
supplier. Violators would have to pay damages to the tune of double the cost<br>
of the exported equipment.=20<br>
<p>
The commission has its work cut out. The competition in the international<br>
arms trade is fierce, and many countries in the former Soviet Union and<br>
Eastern Europe hope to use the profits from arms export to finance the<br>
rebuilding of their own armed forces. Due to standardization in the Warsaw<br>
Pact, all of these countries are trying to sell basically the same products.<br>
In the case of tanks, this means various Soviet models=96like the T-72 and=<br>
 the<br>
T-80.=20<br>
<p>
THE BALTIC STATES<br>
<p>
POSTPONEMENT OF ADMISSION TO NATO HIGHLIGHTS SECURITY PROBLEMS. Presidents<br>
Lennart Meri of Estonia, Guntis Ulmanis of Latvia, and Algirdas Brazauskas<br>
of Lithuania issued over the weekend a joint "Statement on Security in the<br>
Baltic Region." The statement reaffirmed that only an early accession to<br>
NATO can guarantee their countries' freedom and it requested the alliance to<br>
take "the clearest possible" stand on Baltic security. The presidents<br>
announced that their countries would intensify diplomatic efforts to obtain<br>
political support for their accession to NATO and for developing bilateral<br>
security cooperation with its member countries. They also pledged to make<br>
"the necessary sacrifices" in order to upgrade their own forces and to<br>
participate in NATO's common defense. (BNS, September 29) The statement was<br>
a reaction to official assertions from U.S. secretary of defense William<br>
Perry and other Pentagon officials -- made at the September 27 NATO defense<br>
ministers' meeting in Bergen (Norway) -- notifying the Baltic states<br>
officially and publicly that they are "not yet" eligible for admission to<br>
the alliance because they are unable to come to the aid of allied countries<br>
if necessary.=20<br>
<p>
Other Baltic officials challenged that criterion. Lithuanian foreign<br>
minister Povilas Gylys observed that NATO's enlargement ought to proceed<br>
from the principle of indivisible security, and consequently must take into<br>
account not only the countries' level of readiness but also their security<br>
needs. Those needs, Gylys noted, are clearly greater in the Baltic region<br>
than in Central Europe, where NATO has decided to enlarge first. Other<br>
Lithuanian Foreign Ministry officials, said to be "very surprised" at<br>
Perry's criteria for admission to NATO, recalled that immediate military<br>
readiness had not been a requirement for admission when NATO was founded.<br>
They argued that countries reached that level of readiness as a result of<br>
being admitted to the alliance. Latvian Foreign Policy Institute director<br>
Atis Lejins pointed out that the Central European countries slated to be<br>
admitted first do not currently meet Perry's criterion either. (BNS, ELTA,<br>
September 28)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
UKRAINE, RUSSIA REVIEW BILATERAL PROBLEMS. Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma<br>
and Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin conferred informally at<br>
Chernomyrdin's dacha near Moscow over the weekend on the wide array of<br>
issues that remain unresolved between the two countries. Neither side<br>
claimed success in the talks, but both indicated that they had sought to<br>
clear the way for an upcoming session of the high-level bilateral economic<br>
cooperation commission, due to convene next month in Kiev. The same issues<br>
had also been raised by Ukrainian foreign minister Hennady Udovenko with his<br>
Russian counterpart, Yevgeny Primakov, at the UN General Assembly session in<br>
New York. Udovenko expressed Kiev's concerns over renewed claims to<br>
Sevastopol by Security Council Secretary Aleksandr Lebed and other Russian<br>
politicians, the recent imposition of quantitative limitations and a 20<br>
percent value-added tax on Ukrainian exports to Russia despite a bilateral<br>
free trade agreement, and the slow movement in talks on the Black Sea Fleet.<br>
The Ukrainian foreign minister stated that "a peaceful, democratic, and<br>
prosperous Ukraine will pose no difficulty to Russia. Russia will never have<br>
any problem with us, but it should recognize that we are an independent<br>
state, not a little brother as in the former Soviet Union or in some<br>
mythical new union." (Interfax-Ukraine, Nezavisimaya gazeta, September 28<br>
and 29)=20<br>
<p>
Back in Kiev, Kuchma offered a sanguine view of the talks with Chernomyrdin<br>
and expressed the hope that they might pave the way for president Boris<br>
Yeltsin's long overdue visit to Kiev for the signing of an interstate<br>
political treaty. That hope seems increasingly forlorn in view of Yeltsin's<br>
condition and the fact that the Russian president has repeatedly postponed<br>
the visit over the past three years. Chernomyrdin and Lebed, moreover, seem<br>
currently to be vying for the leading role in Russian policy toward Ukraine.<br>
Kiev appears to prefer to deal with Chernomyrdin, and might be prepared to<br>
hand him some successes at the forthcoming talks.=20<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
AMID CRACKDOWN, TER-PETROSIAN PROCLAIMED VICTORIOUS. Armenia's Central<br>
Election Commission (CEC) yesterday issued what it termed the final results<br>
of the September 22 presidential election. It credited incumbent president<br>
Levon Ter-Petrosian with 51.75 percent of the vote, the opposition National<br>
Accord bloc's joint candidate Vazgen Manukian with 41.3 percent, Communist<br>
candidate Sergei Badalian with 6.3 percent, and Scientific-Industrial and<br>
Civic Union's candidate Ashot Manucharian with 0.6 percent. There was no<br>
immediate word on voter turnout; interim reports had indicated a low turnout<br>
in the range of 55 percent. According to Western observers in Yerevan, the<br>
official returns suggest that even if the electoral fraud was less<br>
systematic than claimed by the opposition, it sufficed to tip Ter-Petrosian<br>
over the 50 percent mark and avoid a runoff, which the united opposition had<br>
expected to win.<br>
<p>
Western diplomats in Yerevan said yesterday that some 200 members of<br>
opposition parties have been arrested since the September 25 violence in and<br>
around parliament. According to Western correspondents, troop and armor are<br>
cordoning off central Yerevan to prevent a resumption of pro-opposition mass<br>
demonstrations. In addition, the offices of several opposition parties have<br>
been closed down by security forces, newspapers of those parties are not<br>
being published, and two non-state radio stations in Yerevan have gone off<br>
the air.=20<br>
<p>
Manukian, accused along with others of having organized an anti-government<br>
coup, is in hiding. His wife Varduhi Ishkanian-Manukian met with foreign<br>
correspondents at a clandestine location to announce that her husband's<br>
campaign committee possesses extensive documentation of electoral fraud and<br>
will try to hand it over to international observers. She distributed a<br>
statement from Vazgen Manukian that recounts his view of the September 25<br>
violence, which he blames on provocations by the authorities. (Noyan-Tapan,<br>
Reuter, AP, The New York Times, September 27 through 29)<br>
<p>
ARMENIAN-AMERICAN ORGANIZATION "DEEPLY TROUBLED". The Washington-based<br>
Armenian National Committee of America is "deeply troubled that the Armenian<br>
presidential election, like the parliamentary election in July 1995, was<br>
conducted in a decidedly undemocratic environment marked by widespread<br>
ballot manipulation," an ANCA communique said. The communique deplored "the<br>
government's systematic efforts to subvert the will of the Armenian people<br>
at the ballot box..., the violence being directed by security forces against<br>
demonstrators, the arrest of opposition leaders, the closure of opposition<br>
political parties, the ban on public assembly, and the limits on freedom of<br>
expression introduced by the government." (Noyan-Tapan, September 27)=20<br>

MONITOR - A DAILY BRIEFING ON THE POST-SOVIET STATES<br>
<p>
IN THIS ISSUE: <br>
<p>
* Lebed warns of catastrophe in an apparent effort to undermine Russia's<br>
caretaker prime minister <br>
* The U.S. is downplaying a spy incident reported this week in Moscow <br>
* Russian and Western military leaders make little headway on NATO enlargement <br>
* Armenian authorities move against the opposition following the recent<br>
attack on parliament <br>
* Azerbaijani president hints at possible strategic deal with Moscow... <br>
* ...As Shevardnadze warns basing deal could be rejected * Pressure on Tajik<br>
opposition may be lessened by Taliban's Kabul offensive<br>
<p>
NEWS:<br>
<p>
LEBED BACK IN NORTH CAUCASUS TO DISCUSS CHECHEN PEACE PROCESS. Kremlin<br>
security supremo Aleksandr Lebed flew this morning to Nazran, capital of the<br>
Republic of Ingushetia, to attend a conference of heads of the Russian<br>
republics and regions that border on Chechnya. Also attending the meeting,<br>
which will focus on what regional leaders can do to facilitate the Chechen<br>
peace process, are Chechen opposition leaders Zelimkhan Yandarbiev and Aslan<br>
Maskhadov, and leaders of Krasnodar and Stavropol krais, as well as the<br>
republics of Adygeya and Kalmykia. (Interfax, September 26; Itar-Tass,<br>
September 27) The meeting is organized by Ingush president Ruslan Aushev, a<br>
strong Lebed ally; both men are former Soviet generals who saw action in<br>
Afghanistan.<br>
<p>
GUBERNATORIAL ELECTIONS CONTINUE IN RUSSIA. Final results are still awaited<br>
following the September 22 gubernatorial election in Amur oblast in Russia's<br>
Far East. Preliminary results gave the victory to the Communist candidate,<br>
but voting was very close and there have been complaints that many voters<br>
were prevented by bad weather from casting their ballots. (Interfax,<br>
September 25) This weekend, voters go to the polls in hotly contested<br>
gubernatorial elections in Leningrad and Rostov oblasts. <br>
<p>
POWER WORKERS IN RUSSIAN FAR EAST SUSPEND STRIKE. Power workers in Primorsky<br>
krai in Russia's Far East ended their 12-day strike today when $30 million<br>
was transferred from Moscow to pay wages owed since the spring. Workers'<br>
representatives said they expected payments to start on Monday, but warned<br>
that they will resume their strike in two weeks time if that is not the<br>
case. About 180 of the workers, who were in the third week of a hunger<br>
strike, have also called off their protest. (BBC World Service September 27)<br>
<p>
PENTAGON ADDS JUSTIFICATION FOR POSTPONING BALTIC ACCESSION. At the NATO<br>
defense ministers' meeting in Bergen (Norway) this morning, U.S. defense<br>
secretary William Perry and another Pentagon official were cited as naming a<br>
second reason for postponing the Baltic states' accession to NATO, in<br>
addition to the already stated primary reason that the three states are<br>
militarily unable to assume mutual assistance obligations. The second reason<br>
cited today is that the Baltic states have "disputes with Russia," including<br>
problems over the "treatment of Russian minorities." (UPI, September 27) The<br>
statement diverges from the findings of OSCE and other international<br>
organizations which have found no human rights problems in connection with<br>
the treatment of Russians in the Baltic states. It can also encourage Moscow<br>
to continue artificially heating up the issue as it has in order to<br>
discourage NATO's enlargement in the Baltic region.<br>
<p>
OSCE ENVOY DIFFERS WITH CHRISTOPHER ON ESTONIA. The head of the OSCE 's<br>
mission to Estonia, Herbert Grubmayr, told Estonian prime minister Tiit Vahi<br>
yesterday that, in the mission's view, there are no violations of human<br>
rights in Estonia. Grubmayr expressed regret that U.S. secretary of state<br>
Warren Christopher had mentioned Estonia as a potential crisis area in his<br>
recent policy speech in Stuttgart on security in Europe. "Such statements<br>
require us to refute groundless accusations against Estonia," Grubmayr was<br>
cited as saying. He was referring to Russian accusations that Estonia<br>
violates human rights. Grubmayr is now completing his tour of duty in<br>
Estonia. (BNS, September 26)<br>
<p>
LATVIAN PARLIAMENT ELECTS NEW CHAIRMAN. Latvia's Saeima yesterday elected<br>
Alfreds Cepanis of the Owners' Democratic party (Saimnieks) as the new<br>
parliamentary chairman. Cepanis, whose left-of-center party is the single<br>
largest in parliament, was unopposed. He replaces Ilga Kreituse, whom<br>
Saimnieks recently forced to resign from the party along with her husband,<br>
Aivars Kreituse, the finance minister, on charges of misappropriation of<br>
public funds. (BNS, September 26)<br>
<p>
STALIN'S READING TASTES REVEALED. Today's issue of the Communist newspaper<br>
Pravda publishes a page-long list of the books that Soviet dictator Josef<br>
Stalin ordered from libraries in 1926. (AP, September 27) The titles include<br>
"Is Resurrection Possible?" "Jewish Ritual Murders," "Essence of Hypnosis,"<br>
"Souls of Humans and Animals," "The Right to Kill," "Hooliganism and<br>
Knifing," "How to Cope with Your Nerves," and "Syphilis." Pravda said the<br>
list, which a reporter found in state archives, was evidence of Stalin's<br>
high intellect. "A man is known by the books he reads," the newspaper<br>

<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
MIXED SIGNALS CONTINUE FROM MOSCOW. Confusion over who if anyone is in<br>
charge in Russia deepened yesterday. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's<br>
assertions that he is running the country were ostentatiously undermined by<br>
Security Council secretary Aleksandr Lebed, who called a press conference to<br>
warn in apocalyptic terms that the country is on the edge of an abyss that<br>
could include a mutiny by the army, famine in the Far North, and ecological<br>
catastrophe. Doing his best to show he is carrying out not only his own<br>
functions but also those normally executed by the president, Prime Minister<br>
Chernomyrdin met yesterday with ambassadors of foreign countries represented<br>
in Moscow. (NTV, September 26) He also presided over a cabinet meeting at<br>
which he called for unity in the president's absence. Referring to a likely<br>
battle with parliament over next year's budget, Chernomyrdin warned<br>
ministers that he would not tolerate bickering or lobbying in parliament for<br>
extra cash. But he held out an olive branch to Lebed -- who last month wrote<br>
to both Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin to demand an increased budget allocation<br>
for defense -- by saying that defense spending should be reviewed because<br>
the ministry had not had a fair hearing. (Interfax, Reuters, UPI, September 26)<br>
<p>
Within hours Lebed told a press conference that chaos was growing in the<br>
president's absence. He said Russia had reached a "dangerous watershed"<br>
brought on by governmental impotence caused by Yeltsin's illness. Lebed said<br>
the army was on the brink of revolt, Far Northern regions were so short of<br>
food and fuel that thousands of people might have to be evacuated this<br>
winter, and nuclear power plants and submarines are operating without<br>
regulation. Decision-making had practically dried up, he asserted. "The will<br>
of the state has gone... During the hundred days I have been in my present<br>
post, I have not worked out how decisions are made in this country," he said. <br>
<p>
Earlier in the week, Lebed told a newspaper interviewer that Yeltsin<br>
"communicates with a limited circle of people of which I am not a part."<br>
(Izvestiya, September 25) Lebed's message yesterday was  that, unless urgent<br>
steps are taken immediately, Russia faces a "hot October." In a reference to<br>
the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, Lebed added, "You will have noticed that<br>
October tends to be a troublesome month for Russia." (ORT, September 26) In<br>
this way, Lebed effectively undermined statements by chief Kremlin doctor<br>
Sergei Mironov, who told Russian television that Yeltsin was working two to<br>
three hours a day, and American cardiologist Michael DeBakey, who said that<br>
Yeltsin was alert and that there was "no truth at all" to reports that the<br>
president's liver, kidneys and lungs were too diseased for the operation to<br>
go ahead. (NTV, UPI, September 26) Lebed's main purpose seemed, as before,<br>
to impress the Russian public that he is the only leader with enough resolve<br>
and determination to handle Russia's difficult problems.<br>
<p>
U.S. EMBASSY DOWNPLAYS SPYING INCIDENT. A spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy<br>
in Moscow said yesterday that a spy case publicized a day earlier by the<br>
Russian media was an old one and had not caused any diplomatic fallout<br>
between Moscow and Washington. Representatives of the embassy were<br>
nevertheless reported by a Russian source to be conducting closed-door<br>
discussions with the Russian Foreign Ministry in connection with the<br>
incident. An anonymous source in Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) was<br>
quoted on September 25 as saying that a Russian spy, identified only as<br>
Finkel, had been arrested "some time ago" for passing information to the<br>
CIA. The FSB source had also claimed that a diplomat in the U.S. embassy's<br>
consular section -- identified as John Satter -- had recruited the spy one<br>
year earlier. (See Monitor, September 26) The embassy spokeswoman denied<br>
that last charge, and said that no officer of the U.S. embassy had "been<br>
declared persona non grata, arrested, or charged in recent years." She also<br>
claimed that the arrest had occurred more than two years ago. (UPI,<br>
Interfax, September 26)<br>
<p>
STAND-OFF OVER NATO ENLARGEMENT CONTINUES. The stand-off between Russia and<br>
the West over NATO enlargement continued yesterday following talks in Norway<br>
between Russian defense minister Igor Rodionov and his NATO counterparts. On<br>
the positive side, Rodionov declared that differences over the alliance's<br>
plans would not keep Russia from continuing to cooperate with NATO in Bosnia<br>
and elsewhere. "We will confirm in practice that we are ready to cooperate<br>
for the sake of the preservation of peace," Rodionov was quoted as saying.<br>
The same point was made by Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov during<br>
his recent visit to New York. (See Monitor, September 24)<br>
<p>
But also like Primakov, Rodionov made very clear that Moscow continues to<br>
oppose the alliance's expansion plans. He spoke of the Russian public's<br>
difficulty in accepting that "NATO is a peaceful organization with good<br>
purposes only," and asked why enlargement is moving forward "at a time when<br>
Western officials admit there is no threat to their security from Russia."<br>
More substantively, Rodionov repeated Russian warnings that enlargement<br>
would undermine the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty and, without<br>
providing details, said that Russia would take "adequate" measures to<br>
counter enlargement should it become a fact. A statement released by the<br>
Russian Defense Ministry in Moscow, moreover, said that Rodionov would make<br>
clear to his counterparts in Norway Moscow's belief that NATO's "real<br>
adaptation to the new geopolitical conditions should proceed not through its<br>
expansion, but by turning NATO into an organization for preventing and<br>
settling crises and carrying out peace-making missions in accordance with<br>
mandates issued by the UN Security Council and the OSCE." (Itar-Tass,<br>
September 26)<br>
<p>
The talks yesterday in Norway represented Rodionov's first trip abroad since<br>
his appointment as defense minister, and his first face-to-face meeting with<br>
U.S. defense secretary William Perry and many other NATO defense chiefs.<br>
Perry, in fact, was especially blunt in his public statements on<br>
enlargement, saying that Russian objections to the process are unfounded and<br>
insisting that enlargement will proceed without or without Russia's<br>
cooperation. <br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
ARMENIAN AUTHORITIES CRACK DOWN FOLLOWING OPPOSITION ATTACK ON PARLIAMENT.<br>
The Armenian parliament yesterday voted 155 to 0 to lift the parliamentary<br>
immunity of eight opposition deputies, including presidential candidate<br>
Vazgen Manukian, whose coalition of five parties has claimed victory against<br>
incumbent President Levon Ter-Petrosian in the September 22 presidential<br>
election. Four of the eight deputies were taken away from the chamber by<br>
police, and several were struck by pro-government deputies. Manukian is said<br>
to have gone into hiding. The move against the deputies reduces almost to<br>
naught the opposition's representation in parliament. Security forces also<br>
closed and sealed the offices of several opposition parties. National<br>
Self-Determination Union leader Paruir Hayrikian announced his party's<br>
withdrawal from the opposition's National Accord bloc.<br>
<p>
The reprisals follow the attempt by a pro-opposition crowd to overrun the<br>
parliament and the offices of the Central Election Commission during the<br>
night of September 25-26. That attempt, in turn, was triggered by the CEC's<br>
and the parliamentary leadership's rejection of the opposition bloc's<br>
demands for a recount of the votes in certain electoral districts, where<br>
massive electoral fraud was reported to have been perpetrated. The crowd was<br>
also inflamed by a false report that Manukian had been arrested inside the<br>
building. The attack, repulsed by security forces, capped three consecutive<br>
days of pro-opposition mass demonstrations that involved more than 100,00<br>
participants each day. Yesterday the security forces cordoned off central<br>
Yerevan with armored vehicles and troops to prevent further demonstrations.<br>
Ter-Petrosian also decreed a ban on public meetings, and the defense,<br>
internal affairs, and state security ministers--who are political supporters<br>
of Ter-Petrosian--made televised speeches warning against disorder.<br>
(Noyan-Tapan, AP, Reuter, NTV, September 26)<br>
<p>
IS ALIEV CONSIDERING A STRATEGIC BARGAIN WITH MOSCOW ? Azerbaijani president<br>
Haydar Aliev yesterday told a delegation of the Russian Duma's Military<br>
Affairs Committee that Moscow should "abandon double standards" and uphold<br>
the principle of territorial integrity not only in Chechnya but also in the<br>
former Soviet countries. Azerbaijan supports Russia's territorial integrity,<br>
he said, but Moscow has failed to use "its capacity, unmatched by any other<br>
country," to promote a resolution of the Karabakh conflict on the basis of<br>
that principle. "Azerbaijan, with its important geostrategic position, is<br>
prepared to consider Russia's interests, but Russia must in turn consider<br>
Azerbaijan's interests," Aliev continued. The committee's chairman, Gen. Lev<br>
Rokhlin, was quoted as agreeing that "there should be no double standards.<br>
If Russia wants Chechnya to be within Russia, the same principle should<br>
apply to the Abkhazia, Karabakh, and Transdniester conflicts." Rokhlin, the<br>
1995 conqueror of Grozny, is currently touring the Transcaucasus to assess<br>
prospects for settling the region's conflicts. (Turan, Interfax, September 26)<br>
<p>
Aliev's overture urging mutual consideration of strategic interests is only<br>
the latest in a series of such suggestions, which have at times implied a<br>
willingness to grant to Russia military facilities in Azerbaijan in exchange<br>
for Moscow's support in settling the Karabakh conflict. The suggestions may<br>
be designed primarily to highlight Moscow's unresponsiveness to Azerbaijan's<br>
concerns over Karabakh, the Caspian Sea, and other disputed issues. Yet the<br>
hints at a possible strategic bargain do reflect Baku's recognition of<br>
Moscow's military leverage in the region. They parallel Eduard<br>
Shevardnadze's reluctant and risky proposals to legalize Russia's military<br>
presence in Georgia in exchange for Russian support in settling the Abkhazia<br>
and South Ossetia conflicts (see following item).<br>
<p>
SHEVARDNADZE HOLDS OUT UNLIKELY DEAL ON BASES WITH RUSSIA. Georgian<br>
president Eduard Shevardnadze yesterday told a Tbilisi gathering of refugee<br>
Georgian deputies of the Abkhazian parliament that Russia "can have its<br>
military bases in Georgia if the country's territorial unity is restored...<br>
We have already agreed with the Russian side that the [1994] agreement on<br>
Russian bases in Georgia will be ratified if our territorial integrity is<br>
reestablished." (Itar-Tass, Interfax, September 26) Shevardnadze has often<br>
held out to Moscow a deal along these lines, but recently he has been<br>
especially outspoken in warning that Tbilisi will reorient its policy if<br>
Moscow fails to heed those proposals. A day prior to Shevardnadze's speech<br>
the Russian Defense Ministry's daily, Krasnaya zvezda, warned that<br>
"quarreling with Moscow is fraught with serious consequences for Georgia."<br>
(Krasnaya zvezda, September 25)<br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
AFGHAN CONFLICT MAY RELIEVE PRESSURE ON TAJIKISTAN'S OPPOSITION. Meeting in<br>
Dushanbe yesterday, the Military Council of Russian forces in Tajikistan<br>
concluded that Russian border troops, in cooperation with Afghan forces<br>
loyal to Kabul, have largely succeeded in interdicting the access of Tajik<br>
opposition forces to Tajikistan from their bases in Afghanistan. Moreover,<br>
Kabul's troops in Shugnan province were credited with having attacked and<br>
driven Tajik opposition forces deep inside Afghanistan from the border area.<br>
Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani was cited as having telephoned the<br>
preceding day to renew assurances of his support for the effort to close the<br>
border. Opposition forces inside Tajikistan could be cut off altogether from<br>
their rear bases during the approaching winter.<br>
<p>
Nevertheless, participants expressed concern lest these achievements be<br>
nullified by Kabul's reverses in the face of the Taliban movement's current<br>
offensive. Tajik president Imomali Rahmonov, who attended the Russian<br>
command conference, is preparing an appeal to CIS heads of state for<br>
"assistance in reinforcing the CIS southern border." (Interfax, September 26)<br>
<p>
Such an appeal would clearly reflect discomfort over the prospect that<br>
Kabul's recent defeats could end its pressure on the Tajik opposition. It<br>
would also be consonant with the long-standing attempts of the Russian<br>
command in Tajikistan to obtain reinforcements from Russia and from Central<br>
Asian countries. Moscow has thus far been unable to provide significant<br>
reinforcements, but has repeatedly asked the reluctant governments of<br>
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan to increase the size and extend the<br>
mandate of their token units serving under overall Russian command on the<br>
Tajik-Afghan border.<br>
<p>
CORRECTION: Yesterday's Monitor incorrectly used the acronym SVR to identify<br>
Russia's Federal Security Service. In fact, SVR is the acronym for Russia's<br>
Foreign Intelligence Service. The Federal Security Service is represented by<br>
FSB. <br>

NEWS:<br>
<p>
BALTIC STATES NOTIFIED OF DEFERRAL OF ADMISSION TO NATO. A meeting of<br>
defense ministers and other senior officials from the U.S., Britain, North<br>
European, and Baltic countries, held on September 23 and 24 in Copenhagen,<br>
made clear to the Baltic states that their possible admission to NATO is<br>
being postponed. The main reason for the deferral is that the Baltic states<br>
are currently not capable of fulfilling mutual assistance obligations if<br>
NATO member countries are attacked. The NATO ministers promised to support<br>
the Baltic states' efforts to meet that qualification in the future. In<br>
Washington, Estonian ambassador Toomas Ilves commented that the Baltic<br>
states "are concerned about what will happen to us should NATO's enlargement<br>
fail to include us, given Russia's threats to invade us if NATO expands."<br>
(BNS, September 24 and 25)<br>
<p>
RUSSIA SIGNS TEST BAN TREATY. Russia joined the world's other four nuclear<br>
powers and an additional group of more than 60 countries in signing the<br>
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in New York on September 24. The<br>
treaty, which bars test explosions of nuclear weapons, has been under<br>
negotiation for more than four decades and must still be ratified by its<br>
signatory states. Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov urged "all<br>
countries capable of producing nuclear arms" to sign the treaty. (Western<br>
news agencies, September 24)<br>
<p>
ALL-RUSSIA WARNING STRIKE SCHEDULED FOR NOVEMBER 5. The leadership of<br>
Russia's national trade union confederation called yesterday for a<br>
nationwide warning strike to be held on November 5 to protest against wage<br>
arrears--"Russia's biggest social problem." Whether the strike goes ahead or<br>
not will depend on whether the call receives support from regional trade<br>
union organizations. (Itar-Tass, September 25)<br>
<p>
RUSSIA TO OPEN GOVERNMENT BOND MARKET TO FOREIGNERS. Russia plans to give<br>
foreign investors unlimited access to its high-yielding government bond<br>
market. Last month, Russia eased restrictions to allow foreign investors<br>
limited access, but the liberalization now being planned will lift all<br>
restrictions on foreign investors, allowing them to reap the high returns<br>
available to Russian investors. The new regulations will be introduced<br>
gradually by the end of this year. (Financial Times, September 25) <br>
<p>
UKRAINIAN-POLISH JOINT MILITARY UNIT TAKES TO THE FIELD. The first exercise<br>
of the recently created joint Ukrainian-Polish battalion is underway at the<br>
Nowa Deba testing range in Poland's Krakow military district. The exercise,<br>
code named Tatra-96, tests tactical coordination at the company level<br>
between units from the two countries. Drawn from a Ukrainian mechanized<br>
division in the Carpathian military district and a Polish tank brigade, the<br>
joint battalion is intended to participate in international peacekeeping<br>
operations under NATO or UN aegis. (Interfax-Ukraine, PAP, September 25) The<br>
formation of the joint battalion is part of a broader Ukrainian-Polish<br>
military cooperation that signifies a historic reconciliation among the two<br>
nations. <br>
<p>
AJARIA ELECTION SPELLS STABILITY. The coalition comprised of Ajar Supreme<br>
Soviet chairman Aslan Abashidze's All-Georgia Revival Union and Georgian<br>
president Eduard Shevardnadze's Union of Georgia's Citizens won at least 72<br>
out of 80 seats in the Ajar Republic's legislature in the September 22<br>
election. The turnout was a post-Soviet high of 93 percent, according to<br>
nearly-final returns released yesterday. One seat was won by one of<br>
Georgia's rival communist parties, none of which is represented in the<br>
Tbilisi parliament. (Interfax, September 25) The outcome presages continuing<br>
stability in this autonomous republic of Georgia, in contrast to the Abkhaz<br>
and South Ossetian situations. <br>
<p>
SOUTH OSSETIAN PRIME MINISTER DISMISSED. The chairman of the Council of<br>
Ministers of the unrecognized South Ossetian republic, Vyacheslav Gaborayev,<br>
was dismissed from his post yesterday by decision of the Supreme Soviet on<br>
the proposal of its chairman, Lyudvig Chibirov. The two are political<br>
rivals, and Gaborayev is regarded as especially intransigent on the issue of<br>
separation from Georgia. (Interfax, September 25) His release from office<br>
leaves Gaborayev free to run against Chibirov in November for South<br>
Ossetia's presidency, which Chibirov and the Supreme Soviet resolved earlier<br>
this month to create. Tbilisi has vehemently protested that decision but<br>
might see a silver lining in it if Gaborayev loses the presidential election.<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
VIOLENCE ERUPTS IN YEREVAN. Armenian pro-opposition demonstrators last night<br>
attempted to force their way into the parliament building, which is also the<br>
seat of the Central Election Commission (CEC). The CEC is held responsible<br>
by the opposition for reported fraud in the September 22 presidential<br>
election. Security forces fired, killing at least one and injuring at least<br>
20 protesters. Parliament chairman Babken Ararktsian, who also heads<br>
President Levon Ter-Petrosian's electoral campaign staff, was beaten during<br>
the melee. The president, shown on state television while meeting with the<br>
heads of "power ministries" and commanders of security forces, accused the<br>
opposition of mounting a coup d'etat and decreed a ban on rallies and<br>
demonstrations. The opposition has called another mass rally today. (AP,<br>
Reuter, NTV, September 25 and 26. See Perspective section below)<br>
<p>
Last night's violence capped a third consecutive day in which more than<br>
100,000 people had demonstrated in central Yerevan to protest against<br>
Ter-Petrosian's declaration of victory. The Internal Affairs and Defense<br>
ministries -- whose heads are political supporters of Ter-Petrosian -- had<br>
announced that they would uphold public order. They restricted access to<br>
Yerevan from the countryside to prevent opposition supporters from entering,<br>
and deployed troop cordons around government buildings and the television<br>
station. <br>
<p>
The government-controlled CEC's latest returns showed Ter-Petrosian winning<br>
by 52 percent against the 41 percent credited to united opposition candidate<br>
Vazgen Manukian -- a narrower margin than the previously reported return of<br>
58 percent to 37 percent. Two minor candidates received the balance of the<br>
votes. Opposition representatives offered evidence of mass-scale fraud,<br>
claimed a country-wide return of close to 60 percent for Manukian, and<br>
demanded recounts or repeat voting in many districts. Denied a CEC hearing<br>
and barred from state television and radio, the opposition National Accord<br>
bloc and Manukian issued statements describing Manukian as the legitimate<br>
president-elect. They also accused the authorities of carrying out a coup<br>
d'etat through falsification of the returns and vowed to resist it through<br>
mass protests. (Noyan-Tapan, Western agencies, September 24 and 25) <br>
<p>
Ter-Petrosian needs a return of 50 percent plus one vote to win reelection<br>
in the first round. A return of less than 50 percent would force him into a<br>
runoff with Manukian, which the opposition is confident of winning. Before<br>
election day the president and the opposition had accused each other of<br>
planning to secure victory through fraud or force. The opposition vowed to<br>
avoid a repetition of the cheating that marked last year's parliamentary<br>
election, which international monitors also criticized for being rigged by<br>
the authorities. In the interval between the two elections the opposition<br>
was virtually blocked from state television and also faced obstacles in<br>
distributing its press outside Yerevan. <br>
<p>
INTERNATIONAL MONITORS CRITICIZE AUTHORITIES' PERFORMANCE. The European<br>
Institute for the Media, which monitored the campaign, reported that<br>
television and other state media had "clearly favored Ter-Petrosian through<br>
its tendentious coverage." The OSCE monitoring group in its preliminary<br>
assessment said that television airtime allotted to Ter-Petrosian had far<br>
exceeded the airtime available to all other candidates taken together. OSCE<br>
observers expressed concern over numerous local irregularities committed by<br>
the authorities, but the head of the OSCE delegation stated that this factor<br>
did "not significantly affect" the election's outcome. Other Western<br>
monitors reported that the fraud constituted a widespread pattern. The<br>
Russian-led monitoring group of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly was the<br>
only one to describe the election as free and fair. (Noyan-Tapan, The New<br>
York Times, The Financial Times, September 24 and 25)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
YELTSIN OPERATION DELAY THREATENS TO TURN HIM INTO A LAME DUCK. After<br>
examining the Russian leader yesterday, doctors treating President Boris<br>
Yeltsin ruled out canceling the planned heart operation. Chief surgeon Renat<br>
Akchurin, who is expected to lead the team that will operate on the<br>
president, said the operation will go ahead, but not for six to ten weeks.<br>
The news bolstered the Russian stock market. After plunging 8 points earlier<br>
in the week, prices rose by three percent yesterday. (Reuters, Itar-Tass,<br>
September 25) <br>
<p>
Since Yeltsin is expected to have to spend about two months recuperating<br>
from the operation, the president is likely to remain out of action for the<br>
next four months or so. The Kremlin's main preoccupation must now be to<br>
prevent the perception that Yeltsin is a lame-duck president. Uncertainty<br>
about his ability to govern has already provoked sharp infighting in the<br>
Russia leadership and depressed foreign confidence in Russia's economic<br>
health, discouraging much needed foreign investment. Communist party leaders<br>
have called for Yeltsin to step down, saying they are ready and eager to<br>
contest another presidential election. And Yeltsin's former confidant, Gen.<br>
Aleksandr Korzhakov, made it clear in a newspaper interview this week that<br>
he views Yeltsin as a spent force and is now rooting for another general,<br>
security supremo Aleksandr Lebed, to become the next president. Korzhakov<br>
hinted that he could help Lebed's campaign by providing evidence that other<br>
leaders have embezzled state funds and secreted the money in foreign bank<br>
accounts. (Komsomolskaya pravda, September 24)<br>
<p>
LEBED ON THE WARPATH. Russian Security Council secretary Aleksandr Lebed,<br>
seemingly intent upon positioning himself as the successor to ailing Russian<br>
president Boris Yeltsin, stepped up his anti-government and his anti-Western<br>
rhetoric yesterday. In the first case, Lebed strongly suggested that the<br>
government of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was deliberately holding<br>
back funding earmarked for the military in order to weaken the armed forces<br>
and undermine its defense minister (a political ally of Lebed's). The<br>
result, the retired general charged, is that soldiers and officers are going<br>
hungry, military personnel are forced to beg and steal, and the rate of<br>
suicide in the armed forces is rising. The situation has degenerated to the<br>
point that "an armed mutiny could take place this autumn," he told the<br>
Vechernyaya Moskva newspaper.(Western &amp; Russian agencies, September 25)<br>
Lebed's remarks echo weeks of complaining by military leaders that the<br>
government's wage and funding arrears to the armed forces are lowering<br>
morale and raising resentment. These highly public verbal attacks, which<br>
also come as the government debates its 1997 military budget, have assumed<br>
an increasingly incendiary edge of late that appears to reflect political<br>
motivations beyond those of simply assuring the welfare of military personnel. <br>
<p>
Lebed's remarks about relations with the West were, if anything, more<br>
extreme. The former paratrooper commander excoriated the U.S. for its recent<br>
air attacks on Iraq, and repeated an earlier accusation that Washington may<br>
be planning to launch similar military operations against Russia. Lebed is<br>
scheduled to visit NATO headquarters in early October, and he indicated in<br>
the Vechernyaya Moskva interview that he would "raise this question" while<br>
in Brussels. But Lebed did not stop there. He declared that Moscow would<br>
respond in kind to any U.S. attack and would also not hesitate to fight a<br>
full-scale war. "We have nothing to lose. We have no pain threshold... So<br>
think it over, gentlemen," he was quoted as saying.(UPI, September 25) Such<br>
words stand in sharp contrast to the rhetoric that Lebed has frequently used<br>
while addressing Russia's war in Chechnya, when he has spoken of the army's<br>
-- and the nation's -- physical and morale exhaustion over the violence and<br>
bloodshed there. Like his remarks on the financial problems facing Russia's<br>
military, Lebed's conjuring up of an imaginary war threat from the U.S.<br>
smacks of political posturing that will raise temperatures in Moscow and,<br>
among things, complicate efforts to reach a workable accommodation with NATO. <br>
<p>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for Lebed denied on September 24 that his boss had<br>
threatened to impose economic sanctions on Western companies in response to<br>
NATO enlargement. The spokesman described as a fabrication and a provocation<br>
an interview with Lebed, published on September 24 by the Daily Telegraph,<br>
which contained statements to that effect. (See Monitor, September 25) The<br>
British newspaper, however, insists that the interview did indeed take<br>
place. Its stance is supported by the similarity in tone between Lebed's<br>
remarks on NATO as reported by the Daily Telegraph and those that appeared<br>
in Vechernyaya Moskva. (Itar-Tass, BBC, September 24)<br>
<p>
MOSCOW UNCOVERS TWO MORE FOREIGN AGENTS. Russia's Federal Security Service<br>
(SVR) was back in the news yesterday as representatives of the agency<br>
described two separate incidents in which SVR agents had purportedly managed<br>
to thwart foreign espionage activities. The first involved a Russian<br>
citizen, said to have been recruited by the CIA to procure classified<br>
information on Russia's latest generation of nuclear submarines. An unnamed<br>
SVR source identified the agent as a man named Finkel, who was reportedly an<br>
employee of a St. Petersburg naval institute. He is being investigated on<br>
charges of treason. The source also took the more unusual step of<br>
identifying by name a U.S. embassy official who was allegedly responsible<br>
for recruiting the Russian citizen. (Itar-Tass, September 25)<br>
<p>
Also yesterday, an official SVR spokesman announced that a Swedish<br>
businessman had been accused of filming "strategic facilities" and would be<br>
barred from re-entering Russia. The businessman, identified as Hans<br>
Engstroemer, had begun working in Northwestern Russia in the fall of 1993<br>
and was involved in defense conversion projects. Engstroemer vehemently<br>
denied the Russian allegations in remarks to a Swedish newspaper. (AP,<br>
September 25) Less than a month ago the SVR had directed similar accusations<br>
at another Swedish citizen, and in that case also claimed to have expelled<br>
him from Russia. <br>
<p>
Yesterday's revelations were the latest in a series of spy scandals that<br>
have been publicized in recent months by the SVR, presumably to bolster<br>
claims by the KGB successor agency that Russia is now awash in foreign<br>
spies. Indeed, in an interview published earlier this month SVR director<br>
Col. Gen. Nikolai Kovalev had made precisely that point, and added that the<br>
agency would soon make public several new "sensational cases," including one<br>
involving the CIA. (See Monitor, September 6) <br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
MOLDOVA URGES WITHDRAWAL OF RUSSIAN TROOPS. Addressing the UN General<br>
Assembly yesterday, Moldovan foreign minister Mihai Popov called for an<br>
"undelayed, complete, orderly, and unconditional withdrawal" of the<br>
Operational Group of Russian Forces from Moldova. "We are worried by the<br>
continued stationing of these foreign troops in Moldova in contravention to<br>
our Constitution...and despite Russia's stated commitments at the OSCE and<br>
the Council of Europe to implement the withdrawal agreement," Popov told the<br>
Assembly. (Flux, Basapress, September 25) The 1994 Moldovan Constitution<br>
enshrines Moldova's neutrality and rules out the stationing of foreign<br>
troops in the country. The reference to an undelayed, complete, orderly, and<br>
unconditional withdrawal reproduces a three-year-old OSCE resolution, which<br>
Moscow has failed to observe. The pledge to the Council of Europe to<br>
withdraw the troops from Moldova was among the conditions attached to<br>
Russia's admission as a full member of the CE last year. The troop<br>
withdrawal agreement, signed in 1994, remains unexecuted (see Monitor,<br>
September 25)<br>
<p>
CORRECTION. The item "Pessimism about Russian Economic Prospects" in the<br>
Monitor of September 25 should have read: "Russian deputy economics minister<br>
Andrei Svinarenko said his ministry's best guess for 1997 is zero growth,<br>
with the beginning of an output recovery anticipated only in 1998....<br>
Aleksei Mastepanov of Russia's fuel and energy ministry [said] his<br>
ministry's projections for the year 2000 include a range for oil production<br>
between 88 and 100 percent of last year's level." <br>

NEWS:<br>
<p>
CALL FOR CHECHEN AMNESTY. President Ruslan Aushev of the Republic of<br>
Ingushetia, which borders on Chechnya, has called on the Russian parliament<br>
to declare a general amnesty for all those who fought in the Chechen<br>
opposition forces, including field commanders Shamil Basayev and Salman<br>
Raduyev. (Interfax, September 24) Aushev is a member of the upper house of<br>
the Russian parliament.<br>
<p>
CHECHEN OPPOSITION COMPLETES LIST OF COALITION GOVERNMENT. Chechen<br>
resistance leaders have agreed to a list of fourteen candidates for an<br>
interim coalition government to be headed by Zelimkhan Yandarbiev. The full<br>
list will be revealed when Yandarbiev visits Moscow; his visit is<br>
provisionally scheduled for September 30. (Interfax, September 24)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN ADMIRAL ASSAILS WEST. The First Deputy Commander of Russia's Navy<br>
charged on September 23 that the West continues to contemplate the use of<br>
force against Russia. Admiral Igor Kasatonov cited as evidence naval<br>
reconnaissance operations being conducted against Russia and the West's<br>
continuing naval build-up. (Interfax, September 23) Kasatonov's remarks<br>
follow recent accusations that two British ships were spying on the<br>
activities of Russia's Northern Fleet. (See Monitor, September 18)<br>
<p>
START II A "BETRAYAL" OF RUSSIAN INTERESTS. The chairman of the Russian<br>
Duma's defense committee is reported to have told Itar-Tass that legislators<br>
are "unlikely" to ratify the START II Treaty because of NATO plans to expand<br>
eastward and the possibility that the alliance will deploy nuclear weapons<br>
on the territory of new member states. Gen. Lev Rokhlin said that<br>
implementation of START II would be a "betrayal of Russia's national<br>
interests." (Itar-Tass, September 21) <br>
<p>
AEROFLOT-BOEING DEAL TO COME UNDER PRESSURE? A Russian daily reports that<br>
Russian aircraft builders are joining with regional political interests in a<br>
coalition to protect beleaguered domestic aircraft manufacturers. Formation<br>
of the new coalition, which also is said to enjoy a strong presence in<br>
Russia's upper house of parliament, has been energized by Aeroflot's recent<br>
decision to purchase 10 American-made Boeing 737 airliners. (See Monitor,<br>
September 11) The newspaper suggests that Aeroflot may be pressured to nix<br>
the Boeing deal. (Kommersant-daily, September 24)<br>
<p>
CONTROVERSY OVER POLAND-RUSSIAN GAS DEAL. A 25-year agreement on the<br>
delivery of Russian gas to Poland, scheduled to be signed today, has<br>
provoked criticism from some Polish opposition parties on the grounds that<br>
it could make Warsaw energy-dependent on Russia. The gas, to come from the<br>
Russian Yemal peninsula via a 2,500 mile pipeline, will cross Belarus and<br>
Poland on its way to Germany and Western Europe. Defenders of the deal argue<br>
that Russia could not blackmail Poland because that would mean also cutting<br>
gas deliveries to Germany and Western Europe. (UPI, September 24)<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
MISSILE DEFENSE AGREEMENT HIGHLIGHTS PRIMAKOV-CHRISTOPHER TALKS. The U.S.<br>
and Russia announced on September 23 that they had concluded the first part<br>
of a new agreement on missile defense systems, and that negotiations on a<br>
second part would begin next month. Announcement of the accord, which was<br>
described as a "milestone" by U.S. secretary of state Warren Christopher,<br>
came following several hours of intensive talks in New York between<br>
Christopher and Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov. The September 23<br>
agreement pertains to theater missile defenses and covers so-called<br>
low-velocity systems, while the second part of the agreement will deal with<br>
higher-velocity systems. Conclusion of a final agreement is important<br>
because it would, in Primakov's words, "signify the line of demarcation<br>
between strategic and theater anti-ballistic missiles." Establishing that<br>
demarcation could allow the U.S. to continue developing missile defense<br>
systems without violating the 1972 ABM Treaty. Primakov suggested that the<br>
agreement might also have a positive impact on Russia's parliamentary debate<br>
over ratification of the START II Treaty. The U.S. Congress has ratified<br>
START II, but opposition to the treaty in Russia -- based in part on a fear<br>
that the U.S. intends to violate the ABM Treaty -- has delayed efforts to<br>
bring it to a vote. (The New York Times, Reuter, UPI, September 24)<br>
<p>
Along with the missile defense accord, the talks in New York highlighted<br>
several other areas of cooperation between the U.S. and Russia, including<br>
agreement on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and on continued Russian<br>
participation in the Bosnian peacekeeping force. But the talks also revealed<br>
enduring disagreements between the two sides -- NATO enlargement foremost<br>
among them. Primakov restated Moscow's opposition to NATO's plans, and<br>
categorized as "exaggerated" claims by U.S. officials that Moscow is now<br>
deeply engaged in negotiations that link Russian acquiescence to enlargement<br>
with a "charter" agreement between Moscow and the alliance. The two sides<br>
also failed to resolve their differences on Iraq and the former Yugoslavia.<br>
Moscow spearheaded world criticism of the recent U.S. air attacks on Iraq<br>
and more recently has clashed with Washington over the latter's wish to<br>
delay the lifting of UN sanctions on Belgrade. (The Washington Post, Reuter,<br>
September 24)<br>
<p>
LEBED THREATENS SANCTIONS TO COUNTER NATO ENLARGEMENT. Russian Security<br>
Council secretary Aleksandr Lebed, formerly a moderate on the issue of NATO<br>
enlargement, threatened in a September 24 newspaper interview that Moscow<br>
would slap economic sanctions on U.S. and German companies as a response to<br>
the alliance's expansion. "Let there be no mistake," Lebed was quoted as<br>
saying. "German and American industrial interests in Russia will suffer<br>
directly as a result of enlargement plans." Lebed leveled some of his<br>
sharpest criticism at Bonn, whose post-unification policies he compared<br>
acidly to the construction of a "Fourth Reich." Vowing that Russia would not<br>
fall into Germany's sphere of influence, Lebed suggested a link between NATO<br>
enlargement and an alleged policy of German expansionism in Eastern Europe.<br>
"The German Defense Ministry, clearly determined to expand Germany's sphere<br>
of influence to the East, has driven the expansion policy," Lebed was quoted<br>
as saying. "With the enlargement of NATO and of the European Union, the<br>
whole of central and eastern Europe will come under German economic and<br>
political domination." (AP, September 24)<br>
<p>
Lebed's remarks, reported in Britain by yesterday's Daily Telegraph, came on<br>
the eve of today's meeting in Norway of NATO defense ministers. Russian<br>
defense chief Igor Rodionov, a political ally of Lebed's, is to take part in<br>
that meeting. Although various Russian political leaders have threatened a<br>
number of possible counter-measures to NATO's enlargement, Lebed's talk of<br>
economic sanctions would seem to be a first from a major government figure.<br>
However, Lebed's threat was discounted later in the day by First Deputy<br>
Prime Minister Aleksei Bolshakov, who said that the possibility of using<br>
sanctions against Western countries involved in NATO's expansion has not<br>
been raised in the Russian government. In fact, he said, Moscow seeks a<br>
further liberalization of its foreign trade relations. (Itar-Tass, September 24)<br>
<p>
UNCERTAINTY OVER HEALTH OF RUSSIAN PRESIDENT. Mixed signals continued to<br>
come from Moscow yesterday as the Kremlin insisted that President Boris<br>
Yeltsin was in charge of the government even as his doctors said Russia's<br>
ailing leader might not be well enough to undergo heart bypass surgery.<br>
Yeltsin met yesterday for forty minutes with Prime Minister Viktor<br>
Chernomyrdin, after which Chernomyrdin insisted that Yeltsin was well enough<br>
to stay in office and should not step down. (Interfax, September 24) The<br>
doctors treating the president were to decide today whether and when to<br>
operate. Communist party leader Gennady Zyuganov has already said that<br>
Yeltsin should step down and that fresh elections should be held in three<br>
months if the operation does not take place. (Interfax, September 23) <br>
<p>
The Russian stock market has reacted sharply to the apparent seriousness of<br>
Yeltsin's illness. But although stocks in Russian companies fell five<br>
percent in busy trading, short-term government treasury bills, which make up<br>
most of the Russian government's internal debt, registered little reaction.<br>
(Interfax, September 24) The explanation may lie in the fact while the stock<br>
market contains a good deal of foreign money, the treasury bill market is<br>
dominated by domestic funds. Many Russian investors are more skeptical than<br>
their western counterparts about the importance of political developments,<br>
taking the view that high-level politics are of little relevance to the<br>
economy. <br>
<p>
MAYOR OF VLADIVOSTOK REINSTATED. President Boris Yeltsin has signed a decree<br>
reinstating the mayor of Vladivostok, Viktor Cherepkov, to the post from<br>
which Yeltsin dismissed him two years ago. (Interfax, September 24)<br>
Cherepkov was democratically elected in 1992 after winning more votes than<br>
all eighteen of his rivals put together. While in office he campaigned<br>
against bribery and corruption among high-ranking city officials, but was<br>
dismissed by presidential decree in 1994, following allegations that he had<br>
himself taken bribes. Cherepkov never ceased to protest his innocence,<br>
however, and this year an investigation by the newspaper Izvestiya concluded<br>
that he had been framed by Yevgeny Nazdratenko, governor of Primorsky krai,<br>
of which Vladivostok is the capital. Last month, a Moscow court found in<br>
Cherepkov's favor, ruling that Yeltsin had overstepped his powers in sacking<br>
Cherepkov. <br>
<p>
The Cherepkov case could safeguard the posts of other democratically elected<br>
officials. On June 6 of this year, Yeltsin signed a controversial decree in<br>
which he granted himself the right to dismiss popularly elected regional<br>
governors. Although the constitutionality of this decree has yet to be<br>
challenged, the Cherepkov case suggests that Yeltsin might find himself on<br>
shaky ground if he tried to employ the June 6 decree.<br>
<p>
PESSIMISM ABOUT RUSSIAN ECONOMIC PROSPECTS. Participants in a seminar in<br>
Helsinki on September 23-24 took a gloomy view of Russia's short-term<br>
economic prospects and were not much more enthusiastic about likely<br>
medium-term developments. Many speakers said the long-awaited growth in<br>
Russian output is unlikely to come before 1998 and that the economic climate<br>
remains inhospitable to foreign investment. Russian deputy economics<br>
minister Andrei Svinarenko said his ministry's best-case forecast for 1997<br>
is zero growth, followed by a recovery in output only in 1998. Other<br>
speakers were equally downbeat. Aleksei Mastepanov of Russia's fuel and<br>
energy ministry noted that Russian oil production has fallen by 47 percent<br>
from its 1980s peak, coal by 34 percent, and gas by 7 percent. His<br>
ministry's projections for the year 2000 suggest a further decline -- to<br>
between 88 and 100 percent of last year's level. Mastepanov described<br>
ambitious plans for energy conservation and a revival of energy production,<br>
but acknowledged that large investments are required and may not be<br>
forthcoming. <br>
<p>
Much of the discussion revolved around the issue of whether or not standard<br>
free market reform prescriptions are working in Russia. Several senior<br>
Russian economists deplored Russia's "deindustrialization" and described it<br>
as the main effect of the reforms. Simon Clarke of Britain's University of<br>
Warwick argued that formal privatization has not changed the behavior of<br>
Russia's former state enterprises. Instead of collapsing and releasing labor<br>
and capital for new, market- oriented firms, former state enterprises are<br>
being kept alive by Soviet-era managers in ways that western experts and<br>
advisers did not foresee. The result, according to Clarke, is continued<br>
stagnation. Alan Gelb of the World Bank compared Russia with other<br>
transition economies. He offered some grounds for hope that Russia will at<br>
some point follow the pattern of output recovery after financial<br>
stabilization that has been seen in Poland, Estonia, the Czech Republic, and<br>
others. But he cautioned that in Russia this process has been delayed by the<br>
incoherence of Russian reforms, the low credibility of the Russian<br>
government, and exceptionally high rates of crime. (A Monitor correspondent<br>
participated in the seminar)<br>
<p>
LIVSHITS' NEW ROLE. The September 19 appointment of Aleksandr Livshits to<br>
the Russian Security Council puts the finance minister in a delicate<br>
position. The appointment follows mounting criticism from the Russian<br>
defense ministry over projected defense spending in next year's federal<br>
budget and comes amid complaints that the regular army is being shortchanged<br>
in relation to other "power structures" in the release of government funds<br>
this year. (See below, and Monitor, September 19) Against this background,<br>
the appointment of Livshits has been interpreted in the Russian press as a<br>
sign that Yeltsin's former economics adviser remains in favor with the<br>
president and is being given the role of counterweight within the powerful<br>
Security Council to Aleksandr Lebed's pet economist, Sergei Glazyev.<br>
(Kommersant-daily, September 20) Asked to assess his role on the Security<br>
Council, Livshits said he was there to ensure that grandiose plans for<br>
ensuring Russia's military security were kept in line with the country's<br>
economic capabilities. (NTV, September 19) <br>
<p>
WAGE PROTESTS AND DISSATISFACTION IN THE RUSSIAN ARMY. A Russian newspaper<br>
reported on September 19 that information on the government's mounting wage<br>
debt to civilian employees of the Defense Ministry had been suppressed<br>
deliberately by former defense minister Pavel Grachev. Sources within the<br>
ministry suggested that Grachev had acted on the orders of government<br>
leaders, who feared that publication of the wage arrears figures would hurt<br>
Boris Yeltsin's reelection chances. According to the same report, current<br>
Russian defense minister Igor Rodionov is behind the decision to make those<br>
figures public. Rodionov is reportedly motivated by his sympathy for the<br>
ministry's civilian employees, who are owed more than 6 trillion rubles,<br>
and, probably of greater importance, by a decision to launch a<br>
no-holds-barred battle within the government for greater defense funding.<br>
(Nezavisimaya gazeta, September 19)<br>
<p>
The revelations about wage arrears come amid rumors of growing<br>
disgruntlement in the ranks of Russia's regular armed forces. Indeed, a<br>
German newspaper claims to have obtained a Russian Defense Ministry report<br>
indicating that opposition to President Boris Yeltsin and his government is<br>
increasing among Russian servicemen. According to Der Tagesspiegel, military<br>
leaders also claim in the report that they can no longer guarantee the<br>
loyalty of their troops. (AP, September 22) A similar conclusion was voiced<br>
last week by Segodnya's respected military analyst Pavel Felgengauer, who<br>
suggested that a failure by the government to solve the problem of defense<br>
financing might "lead to a social protest that could transform into a mutiny<br>
and eventually even challenge civilian rule in Russia." (AP, September 19)<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE RUSSIAN-MOLDOVAN TROOP WTHDRAWAL AGREEMENT?<br>
Moldovan foreign minister Mihai Popov, meeting on September 23 with his<br>
Russian counterpart Yevgeny Primakov in New York, urged the "soonest<br>
possible ratification by the Duma" of the agreement to withdraw Russian<br>
troops from Moldova and of the Russian-Moldovan political treaty.<br>
Ratification would "strengthen confidence" between the two countries, Popov<br>
said. Primakov, who says he has made relations with CIS countries a "top<br>
priority," has yet to respond to Chisinau's invitation to visit Moldova.<br>
(Flux, Basapress, September 23)<br>
<p>
The troop withdrawal agreement, signed by Prime Ministers Viktor<br>
Chernomyrdin and Andrei Sangheli in October 1994, was turned into a dead<br>
letter by the Russian side when it claimed immediately afterward that the<br>
document required parliamentary ratification. The agreement itself contained<br>
no such provision and was obviously not going to be ratified in a Russian<br>
Duma dominated by nationalists and Communists. The Kremlin, moreover, has<br>
made no attempt to obtain ratification. Moldovan president Mircea Snegur has<br>
himself practically dropped the issue since embarking more than a year ago<br>
on an uphill effort to win reelection. In order to achieve that goal Snegur<br>
feels he needs, at the least, Moscow's benign acceptance. <br>
<p>
The bilateral political treaty, signed by Presidents Boris Yeltsin and<br>
Snegur back in 1990 before their countries had become subjects of<br>
international law, contains as its centerpiece an unqualified mutual<br>
recognition of the two countries' independence and territorial integrity. In<br>
February 1995, Snegur accepted and initialed a "supplementary protocol,"<br>
proposed to him by Yeltsin as an attachment to the political treaty and as a<br>
condition for the Kremlin's support in winning the treaty's ratification.<br>
The protocol provided for joint Russian-Moldovan actions, including military<br>
measures, to defend regional peace and security if either side considers<br>
that a threat to peace has arisen. Leaders of the governing Agrarian<br>
Democratic party extricated Chisinau from the trap by refusing to discuss<br>
the protocol prior to the withdrawal of Russian troops from Moldova.<br>
Meanwhile the deadlock persists, and the issue of Russian troops unlawfully<br>
stationed in an independent European state against its will seems to be<br>
fading from international attention. <br>

ARMENIAN PRESIDENT CLAIMS VICTORY, OPPOSITION REJECTS RETURNS. Incumbent<br>
Armenian president Levon Ter-Petrosian yesterday evening claimed victory in<br>
the September 22 presidential election. As he spoke, returns from most of<br>
the country showed him leading the opposition bloc's candidate, Vazgen<br>
Manukian, by 56 to 37 percent. Manukian had carried Yerevan, but<br>
Ter-Petrosian was more than making up that loss in the countryside,<br>
according to the Central Election Commission's returns. The opposition<br>
staged a mass demonstration in central Yerevan last night, accusing the<br>
authorities of massive fraud in the vote count. Manukian and other<br>
opposition leaders vowed further protest actions and called for<br>
Ter-Petrosian's resignation. (Noyan-Tapan, September 23)<br>
<p>
RESULTS SUGGEST COMMUNIST VICTORY IN LATEST RUSSIAN REGIONAL ELECTION.<br>
Provisional results from Sunday's gubernatorial election in Amur oblast in<br>
Russia's Far East indicate a narrow victory for the Communist challenger.<br>
The victor is Anatoly Belonogov, chairman of the regional legislature, with<br>
41.77 percent of the vote. The incumbent, Yuri Lyashko, who had strong<br>
Kremlin backing, has 41.69 percent. Turnout was relatively low at 35<br>
percent. (Interfax, RTR, September 23) Amur oblast belongs to Russia's "Red<br>
Belt" and its relations with Moscow have been stormy over the past five<br>
years. The September 1 victory of the incumbent in another Red Belt region,<br>
Saratov oblast, had prompted predictions that Kremlin-approved incumbents<br>
would do well in the wake of President Boris Yeltsin's reelection.<br>
<p>
FAR NORTH WORKERS THREATEN TO JOIN STRIKE. Workers in all the enterprises in<br>
Vorkuta, in Russia's Far Northern Komi Republic , will join the nationwide<br>
miners' strike called for October 1. (Interfax, September 19) The miners are<br>
demanding unpaid wages dating back to May and workers in other vital<br>
services have promised to bring the entire city to a halt. Announcement of<br>
the strike in the Far North comes as striking power workers in the Far<br>
East's Primorsky krai have reduced energy supplies in cities on the Pacific<br>
coast to below twelve hours per day. (Monitor, September 23)<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON ANTICIPATES STEADY COURSE FROM MOSCOW. U.S. president Bill<br>
Clinton said yesterday that Washington expects relations with Moscow to<br>
"proceed on a normal course," despite Russian president Boris Yeltsin's<br>
heart problems. Clinton told reporters both that Russia has "come a long way<br>
in developing constitutional mechanisms of authority," and that the U.S.<br>
continues to maintain "regular contact" with other top Kremlin officials.<br>
(Reuter, September 23)<br>
<p>
TEHRAN AWAITS THIRD RUSSIAN SUBMARINE. Iranian news sources have indicated<br>
that Tehran anticipates delivery of a third Russian-made submarine within<br>
the next six months. Iranian naval leaders described the acquisition as part<br>
of a national program to strengthen and modernize Iran's fleet. Tehran<br>
already has two Russian Kilo-class submarines, each of which is reported now<br>
to be operational. (Xinhua, September 22; AP, September 23)<br>
<p>
ABKHAZIAN ACCESS TO TURKEY CURBED. Turkey's Foreign Ministry yesterday<br>
informed representatives of Abkhazia in Istanbul that residents of that<br>
Georgian break-away region will no longer be allowed into Turkey with the<br>
Soviet-type passports issued by the Sukhumi authorities. Abkhazians wishing<br>
to enter Turkey must henceforth obtain valid Georgian passports from<br>
Tbilisi. (Interfax, September 23). Turkey's gesture, which reflects warming<br>
Georgian-Turkish relations, did not come easily. Commuter trade with Turkey<br>
is a vital source of supply for Abkhazia, and the Abkhaz diaspora residing<br>
in northern Turkey seeks to maintain the direct ties that have developed in<br>
recent years with their kinsmen.<br>
<p>
PERSPECTIVE:<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FEDERATION<br>
<p>
KREMLIN DENIES REPORTS OF YELTSIN'S INCAPACITATION. President Boris<br>
Yeltsin's press secretary has angrily denied a report carried by the<br>
Financial Times on September 23 that Yeltsin has suffered a stroke and is<br>
unable to work more than 15 minutes a day. (Interfax, September 23) Quoting<br>
Kremlin insiders, the Financial Times said that Yeltsin has not signed a<br>
single document since suffering a third heart attack in late June and that<br>
all decrees and orders purportedly authorized by the Russian leader are in<br>
fact being signed by Anatoly Chubais, his chief-of-staff, "using a rubber<br>
stamp of the president's signature." (Financial Times, September 23) The<br>
same rumor, reportedly spread by sources in the Security Council, had<br>
already been denied by the Kremlin when it first surfaced a couple of weeks<br>
ago. <br>
<p>
The 65-year-old leader is now one day away from a decision by his doctors on<br>
possible heart surgery. But the surgeon tipped to perform the operation,<br>
Renat Akchurin, said in a weekend television interview that Yeltsin's other<br>
health problems (generally believed to be liver problems caused by alcohol<br>
consumption) could lead to a postponement of the operation for another six<br>
to eight weeks, or even to cancellation of the surgery. According to<br>
Akchurin, patients with complications generally have an 85 to 90 percent<br>
chance of surviving heart surgery of the kind being considered for Yeltsin.<br>
(Reuters, September 23) <br>
<p>
MOSCOW APPROACHING ACCEPTANCE OF NATO ENLARGEMENT? As they crisscrossed the<br>
Atlantic Ocean over the weekend, Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov<br>
and U.S. secretary of defense William Perry assumed the key roles in the<br>
latest round of public negotiation over NATO enlargement. Primakov led off<br>
during a September 20 visit to Vienna during which he addressed OSCE leaders<br>
and held separate talks with the Austrian chancellor and the NATO<br>
secretary-general. In his OSCE speech, Primakov restated Moscow's<br>
long-standing opposition to the advancement of NATO's "military<br>
infrastructure" toward Russia's border and made no reference either to<br>
Washington's recent calls for a "charter" agreement with Russia or to its<br>
proposals outlining an enlarged "Partnership for Peace" program. Instead,<br>
Primakov reiterated Moscow's desire that the OSCE be made Europe's central<br>
security structure and accused the West of reneging on promises not to<br>
expand NATO eastward following Germany's reunification and the dissolution<br>
of the Warsaw Pact. (Russian and Western agencies, September 20)<br>
<p>
In addition to slamming Russia for failing to reduce its tactical nuclear<br>
weapons arsenal, Perry, in turn, restated Washington's own commitment to<br>
enlargement during a visit to Helsinki on September 21. But while shaking<br>
the stick he also offered the carrot. Perry told reporters that he<br>
understood Moscow's concerns about enlargement and that he strongly favored<br>
using the charter proposal to give Russia a significant voice in NATO<br>
affairs. That voice, Perry suggested, might include Russian participation on<br>
NATO committees dealing with such sensitive issues as nuclear weapons, as<br>
well as a permanent office at NATO headquarters in Brussels. But Perry also<br>
made clear that the charter agreement would not confer on Russia voting<br>
rights in alliance affairs. (Western agencies, September 21)<br>
<p>
Although Russian officials have described a merely "consultative" agreement<br>
with NATO as unacceptable, Primakov did suggest during remarks made in New<br>
York yesterday that Moscow may be preparing itself for a grudging acceptance<br>
of NATO's inevitable expansion. "Our position is clear, we are against that<br>
[enlargement]," Primakov said, but "we want to find forms which may mitigate<br>
a possible NATO expansion's negative consequences on our relations." And<br>
while warning that Russia would react "adequately" to enlargement, Primakov<br>
said that Moscow would nevertheless seek "to avoid serious collisions in<br>
relations with the West" over the issue. (Itar-Tass, September 23)<br>
<p>
Primakov's words probably warrant little cheer in the West. They suggest<br>
that Moscow will continue to wage a fierce rearguard action against<br>
enlargement, and that acquiescence -- when and if it comes -- will be<br>
motivated primarily by a calculation that it is better to be inside than<br>
outside the European security building process. Western leaders obviously<br>
hope that such a scenario will afford them the chance to "win over" Moscow,<br>
but the presence in NATO of a potentially disruptive force at a time when<br>
the alliance is negotiating a number wrenching changes is likely to be a<br>
mixed blessing at best. <br>
<p>
RUSSIAN BUDGET CRUNCH. Several Russian Duma deputies have expressed<br>
reservations about the feasibility of Russia's draft 1997 federal<br>
budget.(Interfax, September 19) According to Finance Minister Aleksandr<br>
Livshits, the draft is based on a projection that gross domestic product<br>
(GDP) will grow by one percent in 1997 over 1996 and on the expectation that<br>
the federal authorities will be able to collect for the federal budget taxes<br>
equivalent to 15.9 percent of GDP. (NTV, September 19) Each of these<br>
assumptions is suspect, however. The base-line scenario for the economy<br>
currently being used by Russia's Economics Ministry predicts zero growth<br>
between 1996 and 1997. (Presentation by Deputy Economics Minister Andrei<br>
Svinarenko at a seminar in Helsinki, September 23) Real GDP may therefore<br>
prove to be lower than that envisaged in the budget. At present, too, the<br>
federal budget is receiving only something on the order of 12 percent of GDP<br>
in tax revenue. <br>
<p>
The government is therefore in a tricky position. It is under pressure from<br>
both parliament and lobbying groups to spend more than is planned, yet the<br>
plans themselves may be based on excessive optimism about the amount of<br>
revenue that can be raised. Moreover, work on the 1997 budget was delayed by<br>
the presidential elections and the draft was presented to the Duma literally<br>
at the eleventh hour on August 31. It arrived at a moment when this year's<br>
budget was running into difficulties caused primarily by underpayment of<br>
taxes by enterprises. Criticism of the 1997 draft includes the usual<br>
complaints from the Defense Ministry that it is being underfunded, and<br>
criticism from the prominent Security Council economist Sergei Glazyev that<br>
the government is not doing enough to revive investment--another perennial<br>
complaint. Mikhail Leontyev of the newspaper Segodnya has likened the<br>
government's dilemma to that of a drug addict: the government knows its<br>
efforts to extract more tax revenue from businesses will contribute to a<br>
further decline in output and therefore in the tax base, but it is driven by<br>
such an urgent need to meet expenditure commitments that it carries on<br>
regardless. (NTV, September 19) <br>
<p>
CHECHNYA HEARINGS, YANDARBIEV VISIT POSTPONED. Hearings on the Chechen<br>
conflict scheduled for yesterday's session of the Parliamentary Assembly of<br>
the Council of Europe (PACE), in which Russian Security Council secretary<br>
Aleksandr Lebed and Chechen chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov had been invited<br>
to participate, have been postponed. PACE president Leni Fischer said she<br>
received a letter from Lebed on September 21 explaining that he could not<br>
come to Strasbourg because he was busy in Moscow with matters concerning<br>
Chechnya. Yesterday Maskhadov in turn said he would not be traveling to<br>
Strasbourg because he had not received an official invitation. Lebed and<br>
Maskhadov reportedly coordinated their actions by telephone. (RTR, September<br>
23) <br>
<p>
Russian Duma chairman Gennady Seleznev characterized PACE's decision to<br>
postpone the hearings on Chechnya as "a triumph for reason." (Interfax, NTV,<br>
September 23) Indeed, leading Russian politicians had spoken out against the<br>
invitation of Maskhadov, who remains a wanted criminal in Russia. The leader<br>
of Russia's PACE delegation, Vladimir Lukin, called the invitation "crude<br>
and arrogant interference in Russia's internal affairs." Lukin stressed that<br>
he had cleared his statement with Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and<br>
Federation Council, and recommended that Lebed not attend the hearings.<br>
(Interfax, September 11) That prompted Fischer on September 12 to reassert<br>
the Council's "right to examine human rights issues in all member states of<br>
the Council of Europe," and to point out that Russia promised to find a<br>
peaceful solution in Chechnya when it applied to join the Council of Europe.<br>
(UPI, September 23)<br>
<p>
The postponement may be seen as a victory for Russian diplomacy. But<br>
although Lebed's refusal to go to Strasbourg was probably motivated by his<br>
unwillingness to quarrel with the Kremlin, it cannot be ruled out that<br>
Maskhadov declined the invitation because of increasingly strained relations<br>
with Shamil Basayev and those Chechen field commanders who have called for<br>
the formation of an Islamic state and accused the chief-of- staff of<br>
conceding too much to Lebed. (Argumenty i fakty, September 17) Similar<br>
tensions may also underlie the postponement of opposition leader Zelimkhan<br>
Yandarbiev's planned visit to Moscow this week. (Interfax, September 23)<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
GEORGIA SEEMS RIPE FOR REAPPRAISAL OF RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA. Owing to rising<br>
tensions in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Georgian president Eduard<br>
Shevardnadze has canceled a visit to the U.S. and the UN scheduled for this<br>
week, according to presidential officials. Shevardnadze yesterday told the<br>
country on radio that the planned Abkhazian Supreme Soviet elections seek to<br>
"legalize the expulsion" of Georgians from Abkhazia. He also said that the<br>
Russian peacekeeping operation, while ensuring the ceasefire, "in practice<br>
leads not to a political settlement but to consecrating the results of<br>
ethnic cleansing." Recalling that Russian regular troops fought on the<br>
Abkhaz side against Georgia in the 1992-93 war, Shevardnadze urged Russia to<br>
observe Georgia's territorial integrity "not only in words but also in<br>
practice," to end its ties with the "Abkhaz separatist regime" except for<br>
conflict-mediation purposes, and to recognize that Abkhazia's residents are<br>
legally citizens of Georgia. He implied that Tbilisi might renew the Russian<br>
peacekeepers' mandate and deal with Russia as a "strategic partner" if those<br>
conditions were met.<br>
<p>
Shevardnadze's is the latest in a series of warnings that Tbilisi might<br>
seriously reappraise its relations with Moscow if the latter continues to<br>
freeze the existing situation, which favors Abkhazia. Last week Shevardnadze<br>
accused Moscow of providing material support, including arms, to Abkhazia<br>
and South Ossetia. Parliament chairman Zurab Zhvania told the chamber that<br>
Tbilisi would "comprehensively review" its military agreements with Russia,<br>
including the agreement on bases, if the South Ossetian and Abkhazian<br>
elections proceed "under protection of Russian bayonets." Russia's Foreign<br>
Ministry publicly rejected Zhvania's criticism. It also advised Abkhazia<br>
"not to hurry with the elections" and urged both sides to sign a Russian<br>
draft on principles for settling the conflict. (Interfax, BGI, Iprinda,<br>
September 18 through 23)<br>
<p>
Tbilisi has warned at several stages during the past year that it would<br>
terminate the Russian peacekeepers' mandate if their partiality toward<br>
Abkhazia continued, and has also implied that its future military relations<br>
with Russia depend on a satisfactory settlement of the two regional<br>
conflicts. These latest warnings are more explicit, and suggest a move to<br>
prepare public opinion for a policy change. They have also been accompanied<br>
by an effort to establish military assistance relationships with countries<br>
outside the Russian orbit (see recent issues of the Monitor). The growing<br>
probability of an early end to Boris Yeltsin's presidency may be removing<br>
one of the last factors inhibiting a Georgian reappraisal of relations with<br>
Russia, coinciding as it does with the near-exhaustion of Tbilisi's patience<br>
with Moscow's behavior.<br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
CONTROVERSIAL DOCUMENT IMPUTED TO NAZARBAYEV. Moscow media are publicizing a<br>
controversy that pits Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev against the<br>
daily Izvestiya over the newspaper's publication of a letter allegedly<br>
addressed by Nazarbayev to his Uzbek counterpart Islam Karimov. In the<br>
purported secret letter, Nazarbayev criticizes the CIS customs union --<br>
comprised of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan -- and the four<br>
countries' March 1996 "deeper integration treaty," for failing to meet the<br>
interests of the Central Asian states. He also allegedly urges Karimov to<br>
take joint steps toward strengthening the Central Asian union comprised of<br>
Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, including the formation of a common<br>
legislative body of the three countries. Nazarbayev has denied the existence<br>
of the document and condemned Izvestiya for disturbing relations among CIS<br>
countries. (NTV, September 23; Interfax, September 19; Izvestiya, September<br>
18) The document was contained in an article by the Moscow daily's<br>
correspondent in Almaty. Irrespective of the question of authenticity, the<br>
spirit of the alleged letter appears consistent with Nazarbayev's and<br>
Karimov's views on the CIS and the role of Central Asian countries. <br>

UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT "ALARMED" AT RUSSIAN STATEMENTS ON SEVASTOPOL. The<br>
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine has expressed concern at recent<br>
assertions by high-ranking Russian officials that the Crimean port of<br>
Sevastopol does not constitute part of Ukraine but is "a Russian city."<br>
(Interfax, September 20) During the last ten days or so, Russia's chief<br>
security official Aleksandr Lebed, Black Sea Fleet commander Admiral Viktor<br>
Kravchenko, CIS affairs institute director Konstantin Zatulin (whose<br>
institute is sponsored by Russia's Foreign Ministry and other government<br>
agencies) and Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov have in one form or another asserted<br>
a Russian claim to Sevastopol.=20<br>
<p>
MASKHADOV TO STRASBOURG WITHOUT LEBED? The French Embassy in Moscow has<br>
issued a visa to Aslan Maskhadov, chief-of-staff of the Chechen opposition,<br>
who has been invited to attend the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of<br>
Europe in Strasbourg. Maskhadov will travel on a new Russian passport<br>
"issued only a few days ago," an embassy official told Interfax. But sources<br>
close to Aleksandr Lebed, who was invited to attend the meeting along with<br>
Maskhadov, told Interfax that the Security Council secretary will not be<br>
making the trip. (Interfax, September 21)<br>
<p>
MOSCOW VISIT BY CHECHEN OPPOSITION LEADER POSTPONED. The 23 September visit<br>
to Moscow of Zelimkhan Yandarbiev, political leader of the Chechen<br>
opposition, has been postponed until the end of the month, Chechen sources<br>
said. Yandarbiev had been expected to meet with Security Council secretary<br>
Aleksandr Lebed, and perhaps with Russian prime minister and acting head of<br>
state Viktor Chernomyrdin. The sources said agreement had not been reached<br>
on essential protocol issues. (NTV, September 22)<br>
<p>
WITHDRAWAL OF FEDERAL TROOPS FROM CHECHNYA RESUMES. The withdrawal of<br>
federal troops from Chechnya resumed on September 21 after a ten-day break.<br>
Plans call for the withdrawal to be completed by mid-December. The exchange<br>
of prisoners is proceeding slowly. On September 22, the Chechen side<br>
exchanged 11 Russian prisoners-of-war for three Chechen fighters and two<br>
Chechen journalists. (NTV, September 21 and 22)<br>
<p>
CHECHEN LEADERS SAID TO REPEAL ISLAMIC CRIMINAL CODE. According to<br>
unconfirmed sources in the Russian military, Chechen opposition leaders<br>
Zelimkhan Yandarbiev and Aslan Maskhadov have repealed the Islamic criminal<br>
code introduced in Chechnya at the beginning of this month. The Chechen<br>
leaders reportedly acted to avoid the creation of blood feuds that could<br>
tear Chechen society apart. (NTV, September 22)=20<br>
<p>
ST. PETERSBURG AND LENINGRAD OBLAST TO UNITE. Subject to referendums,<br>
Russia's second city, St. Petersburg, and the surrounding Leningrad oblast<br>
will unite in a single administrative unit in 2001. (ORT, September 22)=20<br>

<p>
PERRY LINKS NATO NUKES TO RUSSIAN ARSENAL. U.S. defense secretary William<br>
Perry suggested on September 21 that informal assurances by NATO that it<br>
would not station nuclear warheads on the territories of new member states<br>
could be reconsidered if Moscow does not destroy more of its own tactical<br>
nuclear weapons. Speaking to reporters on a flight from Moscow to Helsinki,<br>
Perry reiterated that "there is no interest and no plan in NATO today for<br>
either increasing the number, the quantity of [nuclear] weapons, or<br>
increasing places where they are based." But Western leaders, Perry<br>
suggested, are concerned because Moscow has moved so slowly in destroying<br>
the short-range nuclear weapons that were returned to Russia from the newly<br>
independent states following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. (Western<br>
agencies, September 21) Aside from addressing a real Western security<br>
concern, Perry's remarks seemed designed also to turn the tables on Moscow,<br>
which has made the potential deployment of nuclear warheads on the territory<br>
of new member states a key point in its criticism of NATO expansion.=20<br>
<p>
LUKOIL'S JOINT VENTURE WITH ARCO COULD BE A GROUND-BREAKER. Atlantic<br>
Richfield (ARCO) and the Russian oil giant LUKoil have agreed to set up a<br>
joint venture -- Lukarco. (Wall Street Journal, September 20) The agreement<br>
goes beyond earlier deals between Russian and western oil companies, which<br>
to date have resulted only in preliminary agreements. Indeed, despite their<br>
need for both the cash and the know-how that western energy companies can<br>
supply, Russian oil companies have so far resisted substantial western<br>
involvement and jealously guarded the oil reserves at their disposal. One<br>
result is that Russia's total oil production continues to fall, while the<br>
contribution of joint ventures to that total amounted last year to only 5<br>
percent. (Finansovye izvestiya, June 20) In the case of Lukarco, however, a<br>
major Russian oil company is bringing a western partner into developments<br>
crucial to the Russian company's own future.<br>
<p>
LUKoil's control of Lukarco will still be considerable: its stake in the<br>
joint venture will be 54 percent, ARCO's 46 percent. ARCO will reportedly<br>
provide most of the cash, while LUKoil's contribution will consist of its<br>
existing stake in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, Caspian offshore<br>
development, and oil fields in Kazakhstan. The difference in the two<br>
partners' contributions reflects their respective strengths: ARCO has<br>
substantial reserves of cash but not of oil, while LUKoil has plenty of oil<br>
but little cash. Although the new venture could set a pattern for other<br>
cash-strapped Russian oil companies, many uncertainties remain about the<br>
deal, not least the security of the Caspian pipeline.=20<br>
<p>
PLIGHT OF MINERS PROVOKES DESPERATE REACTIONS. A coal miner in the western<br>
Siberian town of Anzhero-Sudzhensk has blown himself up with a grenade.<br>
Local police say they do not know why 32-year-old Vladimir Germanov took his<br>
own life, but did not rule out the possibility that he acted out of<br>
desperation caused by non-payment of wages. Fifteen other miners in the town<br>
are on a hunger strike to demand payment of arrears. (Interfax, September<br>
21) Their situation is typical of miners throughout the Kuzbass, which<br>
contains more than a quarter of Russia's coal deposits. Tensions in Kemerovo<br>
have been running high since a $90 million World Bank credit to restructure<br>
the region's coal mining industry disappeared. It is believed to have been<br>
stolen. (NTV, September 21)=20<br>
<p>
Earlier this month the regional governor, Mikhail Kislyuk, suspended all<br>
payments to the federal budget and declared a state of economic emergency in<br>
the oblast, saying he wanted to avoid a repeat of the situation in Primorsky<br>
krai. (Itar-Tass, 9 September 1996) Miners in the town of Prokopevsk in<br>
Kemerovo Oblast are so disgusted with their local authorities that they have<br>
created their own self-governing body. (Nezavisimaya gazeta, September 21)<br>
The new body, which was set up on September 11 at a conference of the town's<br>
work collectives, is reminiscent of the strike committees set up by miners<br>
in the Kuzbass in 1989. That wave of strikes represented a revolt against<br>
the Communist-dominated local governments and state-run trade unions of the<br>
Soviet period, and was supported by Russian leader Boris Yeltsin. But<br>
today's activists are reacting against the independent trade unions created<br>
in 1989 and against the regional authorities installed by the Yeltsin<br>
leadership. The disappearance of the World Bank credit adds a new twist to<br>
an old story.<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN FAR EAST FACING DIFFICULT TRANSITION. Over one hundred power workers<br>
in Primorsky krai in Russia's Far East called off a 16-day hunger strike<br>
last week, after krai governor Yevgeny Nazdratenko promised that they would<br>
soon be paid their wage arrears. (Financial Times, September 20) However, a<br>
far larger number of striking power workers (about 10,000) are refusing to<br>
return to work until they receive their wages. Meanwhile, blackouts continue<br>
throughout the territory. The energy crisis in the Russian Far East vividly<br>
demonstrates the region's long-term economic fragility. Like the Far North,<br>
Russia's Far East was developed during the Soviet period on the basis of<br>
heavily subsidized transport and energy sectors, and the costs of linking<br>
these remote regions to the centers of Russian population and production<br>
were not covered in the prices for food and energy delivered to them. With<br>
the collapse of central planning and the freeing of prices, the populations<br>
of both the Far East and the Far North have had to face the real costs<br>
associated with living and working in remote areas.=20<br>
<p>
In the case of the Far East, proximity to Japan and other Pacific-rim<br>
countries provided an initial stimulus to the economy. Foreign investment<br>
flowed into a number of industries, especially fishing. But most of the<br>
Russian profits from Pacific-rim trading activities have gone offshore, and<br>
the region's underlying problems of economic adaptation and transition<br>
remain considerably more serious than those of most other Russian regions.<br>
These difficulties are reflected in the region's dependence on the federal<br>
budget for subsidies and a net outmigration from the area. Russia's<br>
perennial preoccupation with the possibility of Chinese expansionism is<br>
heightened by the awareness that today's Russian Far East is a large and<br>
sparsely populated region. Perched on the border with densely populated<br>
China, the region is also -- in relative terms -- economically deprived, and<br>
lacks well developed trade links with the outside world. Primorsky governor<br>
Nazdratenko has repeatedly played on Moscow's fears of a Chinese threat to<br>
extract subsidies from the center.=20<br>
<p>
THE BALTIC STATES<br>
<p>
ESTONIAN PRESIDENT REELECTED. President Lennart Meri on September 20<br>
narrowly won reelection to a second five-year term in the second of two<br>
rounds of balloting by Estonia's electoral college. In the runoff Meri<br>
received 196 votes, i.e., 8 votes over the minimum required for election.<br>
Meri's main challenger and traditional political rival, Vice-Chairman of<br>
Parliament Arnold Ruutel, received 126 votes. Yesterday's first ballot in<br>
the electoral college gave Meri 139 votes and his four challengers a total<br>
of 233 votes. The summoning of the electoral college, which consists of all<br>
101 parliamentary deputies plus 273 members of district and town councils,<br>
had been necessitated by the parliament's inconclusive vote two weeks ago,<br>
when Meri finished with 54 votes, short of the 68 required for election.=20<br>
<p>
Despite the close calls in both forums, Meri had clearly outdistanced his<br>
competitors in public opinion surveys taken before the election. Addressing<br>
the electoral college after his victory, Meri pledged continuity in foreign<br>
and domestic policies and closer cooperation with the parliament. A<br>
perception of Meri as unwilling to consult with the deputies was a factor<br>
which complicated his reelection. (Radio Tallinn, BNS, September 20 and 21)<br>
<p>
Born in 1929, Meri was deported with his family to Siberia during the early<br>
years of the Soviet occupation. Later on he achieved distinction as a<br>
scholar and author in the fields of history, philology, and Finno-Ugric<br>
studies. Meri became foreign minister of Estonia in 1990 and was first<br>
elected president in 1992, outvoting Ruutel.=20<br>
<p>
THE WESTERN REGION<br>
<p>
UKRAINE, WEU AGREE ON SECURITY COOPERATION. During a two-day visit to Kiev,<br>
the secretary-general of the Western European Union, Jose Cutileiro,<br>
conferred with Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma, Foreign Minister Hennady<br>
Udovenko, and other officials on establishing cooperation between the WEU<br>
and Ukraine. In what was described as the first-ever joint communiqu=E9=<br>
 signed<br>
by the WEU with a post-Soviet country, the sides noted that Ukraine is an<br>
important cooperation partner in building security in Europe and they agreed<br>
to establish contacts and joint programs.<br>
<p>
Ukrainian officials submitted a specific cooperation plan envisaging, inter<br>
alia, their country's participation in WEU peacekeeping operations and<br>
attendance at WEU military exercises; WEU use of Ukrainian air transport<br>
assets; Ukraine's inclusion in the WEU's space research and satellite-launch<br>
programs; the establishment of a military liaison between Ukraine's Brussels<br>
embassy and the WEU; and the granting, after a transitional period, of WEU<br>
"associate partner" status to Ukraine (the same as that currently planned<br>
for the six countries of the former Warsaw Pact and the three Baltic<br>
states). Cutileiro indicated that Ukraine can obtain this status after<br>
becoming an associate member of the European Union through the member<br>
countries' ratification of the EU-Ukraine partnership and cooperation<br>
agreement. (Interfax-Ukraine, UNIAN, September 19 through 21)<br>
<p>
The WEU, nascent defense arm of the European Union, plans at this stage to<br>
rely mainly on NATO assets in Europe for its operations. Kuchma stated<br>
Ukraine's aspiration to cooperate with the WEU in a speech to its<br>
parliamentary assembly in June. Kiev's goal of WEU associate membership<br>
parallels its quest for a special partnership with NATO, as reaffirmed by<br>
Ukraine's leaders the previous week in talks with the North Atlantic<br>
Assembly's chairman Karsten Voigt. Kiev regards NATO's and the WEU's future<br>
roles in Eastern Europe's security as complementary with one another, and<br>
favors the two organizations' simultaneous enlargement. Kiev defines its own<br>
cooperation with them, short of membership, as part of a future European<br>
security system and not affecting Ukraine's chosen neutral status.<br>
<p>
THE TRANSCAUCASUS<br>
<p>
ARMENIAN PRESIDENT ENDORSED BY MOSCOW. Russian president Boris Yeltsin (or<br>
his office acting in his name) and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin openly<br>
endorsed Armenian president Levon Ter-Petrosian for reelection in<br>
yesterday's presidential balloting. In messages aired by Armenian state<br>
media on election eve, the two Russian leaders wished Ter-Petrosian success,<br>
praising his qualities as a national leader and his contribution to close<br>
Armenian-Russian relations, regional security, and CIS integration.<br>
(Itar-Tass, Interfax, September 20 through 22; See Monitor, September 20,<br>
for an election preview)<br>
<p>
Ter-Petrosian's three competitors, including his main challenger, Vazgen<br>
Manukian, all favor cooperation with Russia at least as much as<br>
Ter-Petrosian does, but their views on foreign and security policies are<br>
considered less predictable that Ter-Petrosian's. Moreover, the Kremlin owes<br>
a debt of gratitude -- alluded to in the weekend statements -- to the<br>
Armenian president for having taken the lead among the presidents of CIS<br>
countries in endorsing Yeltsin for reelection.=20<br>
<p>
GEORGIA'S FORGOTTEN REPUBLIC ELECTS LEGISLATURE. The Autonomous Republic of<br>
Ajaria, a constituent territory of Georgia, held elections to its Supreme<br>
Soviet yesterday. Some 20 parties and organizations, most of them combined<br>
into several blocs, competed for the 80 seats. The incumbent Ajar Supreme<br>
Soviet chairman Aslan Abashidze's All-Georgia Union for Georgia's Rebirth,<br>
together with Georgian president Eduard Shevardnadze's Union of Georgia's<br>
Citizens, formed a bloc that is expected to win a comfortable majority of<br>
seats. Most opposition parties from Tbilisi, including the "Round Table-Free<br>
Georgia" (supporters of the late president Zviad Gamsakhurdia), also<br>
competed, but few were expected to overcome the 5 percent threshold. The<br>
election was held in the absence of international monitoring, under a<br>
perestroika-era electoral law still valid in Ajaria that provides for<br>
monitoring by party delegates only. The OSCE has protested this omission.<br>
(Interfax, Iprinda, September 18 through 22)<br>
<p>
The controversy over international monitoring has almost obscured the fact<br>
that strategically situated Ajaria has been a unique oasis of stability<br>
during the recent years of turmoil in Georgia. In sharp contrast to<br>
developments in Abkhazia or South Ossetia, Abashidze has firmly controlled<br>
his republic and remained loyal to Tbilisi. He has also maintained good<br>
relations with the Russian military, who have facilities in Ajaria, and has<br>
-- jointly with Tbilisi -- cultivated economic cooperation with Turkey.<br>
Situated in southwestern Georgia on the Turkish border and on the Black Sea,<br>
and possessing a major economic asset in the port of Batumi, Ajaria expects<br>
to take advantage of the revenue, foreign investment, and trade to be<br>
generated in the near future by the transit of Caspian oil across Georgia.<br>
<p>
CENTRAL ASIA<br>
<p>
ISLAMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK BECOMING INVOLVED IN THE REGION. A delegation of<br>
the Islamic Development Bank, headed by its chairman Ahmad Muhammad Ali,<br>
completed yesterday a week-long tour of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan,<br>
Turkmenistan, and Azerbaijan, where it attended conferences on investment in<br>
those countries and held talks with the countries' presidents. Under<br>
discussion was the opening of IDB offices in those countries and the<br>
provision of credits for industrial modernization and infrastructure<br>
projects, such as expansion of Kazakhstan's new designated capital city<br>
Akmola and development of the processing industry in Azerbaijan. (Interfax,<br>
September 16 through 22)<br>
<p>
The IDB's activity in the Muslim countries of the former USSR has been<br>
minimal thus far. Associated with the Islamic Conference, a worldwide<br>
association of Islamic states, the IDB does not charge interest on loans,<br>
but only assesses a 2 percent fee for banking services. The IDB is<br>
considered capable of mobilizing capital from oil-rich countries for lending<br>
to and investment in other Muslim countries.=20<br>

<b>Hope Given to Kim Balaian</b><br>
Report from the press-conference of Kim Balayan's lawyer Rouben 
Sahakian. One of the leaders of the Dashnaktsutiun party Kim 
Balayan was arrested on September 26. Though a month passed from 
the day of his arrest, the staff of the investigation group was 
not presented to Kim Balayan. When being the Head of the 
Juridical Commission of Armenian Parliament (in 1990-1995), he 
issued a document about dismissing the persons who are now 
investigating his case. Normally, they should have prejudice 
against him. According to the wife of Kim Balayan, he is kept in 
one cell with criminals, among whom are persons suffering from 
tuberculosis, paranoia, venereal diseases; also drug addicts. It 
is a clear violation of the law, his lawyer, Rouben Sahakian, 
says. The accusation was declared only on October 8. He is 
charged with high treason, participation in mass breaches of the 
peace and illegal weapon custody. The nature of the first two 
accusations, according to the lawyer, is hard to understand 
because they are 'too theoretical'. As to the third one, the 
search in Kim Balayan's flat was implemented with such flagrant 
violations that it has no perspectives.

<b>The Legislation on Conscription to the Army May Be Revised</b><br>
A special department of the Azerbaijani parliament is going to 
bring in a bill on amendments to the law on conscription to the 
army. According to a high-ranking official, one of the 
amendments provides for reduction of the term of military 
service to 18 or 24 months. The Defence Ministry, he says, is 
getting ready to demobilise in 1997 those who have served longer 
than that. Anyway, the ministry will also demobilise the 
servicemen conscripted before 1993.

<b>It's Something Matter with Human Rights in Azerbaijan </b><br>
Commenting on maintaining human rights in Azerbaijan, Richard 
Kozlarich, Ambassador of the USA to Azerbaijan, says: "Not 
everything is well in this sphere". In his words, he has met 
more than once with the Procurator General and other high-
ranking officials to talk over the issue of religious minorities 
in Azerbaijan. "At these meetings I was emphasising the problem 
of registration of the Human Rights organisations in Azerbaijan. 
Existence of such organisations is necessary as they can affect 
positively the international image of the country", he  says.

<b>A New Candidate to Be a "Prisoner of Consciousness"? </b><br>
According to Natella Bairamova, a member of the Azerbaijani 
Society for Women's Rights, Kamal Talibov, an activist of the
Popular Front of Azerbaijan, arrested in the village of Siyagut, 
the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, is still in custody. Some 
of his countrymen surmise that K. Talibov was arrested for 
publishing his critical article about the living conditions in 
Nakhichevan in the "Muhalifat" ("The Opposition") newspaper on 
September 21. 'If Talibov is not released by November 3, i.e. 
after the maximal term of administrative detainment is expired, 
the Human Rights Centre of Azerbaijan will commence detailed 
monitoring of the case', Eldar Zeynalov, Director f the HRC, 
says. By the Amnesty International standards, Talibov may be 
considered a "prisoner of consciousness", as a prisoner confined 
for open defence of civil rights and freedoms via the press and 
for his peaceful political activities.

<b>Four More POWs Discovered</b><br>
Ibrahim Husseinov, the head of the working group of the state 
commission for POWs and hostages, says officials of the ICRC 
have found out the names of four more Azeris, kept in captivity 
in Armenia. They are: Nazim Hafiz-oglu Mehtiyev, Salahaddin 
Perviz-oglu Kyazimzade, Elchin Farzali-oglu Jafarov and Faik 
Veysal-oglu Gadimov.

<b>Every 8 Hours a Policeman Dismissed?</b><br>
According to Ramil Usubov, Minister for Interior, 900 criminals, 
including 120 charged with the crimes against the state, have 
been extradited to Azerbaijan from the CIS countries by virtue 
of respective agreements between the law-enforcement bodies of 
Azerbaijan and the CIS states. He says more than 20 officials of 
the Azerbaijani interior ministry have been accused of various 
crimes and 2500 more policemen fired for neglect of  their 
duties.

<b>M. Chehragani Left Iran</b><br>
Dr. Mahmudali Chehragani, one of the leaders of the National 
Movement of Azeris in Iran, and his family members have 
illegally emigrated from Iran. Facing political pressure, he was 
compelled to withdraw from the last parliamentary elections. A 
committee for Dr. Chehragani's rights was established in 
Azerbaijan. According to Piruz Dilenchi, Chairman of the North 
Committee of the National Liberating Movement of Southern 
Azerbaijan, the pressure on Dr. Chehragani has significantly 
increased lately: he was banned to meet his students; his car 
and house were confiscated. Out of 600 people arrested in recent 
times, 200 were his sympathisers. For Dr. Chehragani's safety 
sake, Mr. Dilenchi refused to reveal his present abode

<b>Austrian Consul Met Kenan Gurel</b><br>
Vekoslav Freisitzer, Consul General of Austria to Russia, has 
visited Baku for a short time to meet with Kenan Gurel, a 
citizen of Turkey and Austria, sentenced to 15 years' 
imprisonment for participation in the attempt at a coup d'etat 
of March, 1995. Having met with Gurel and learned his health 
conditions, Mr. Freisitzer said Austria  was trying to shorten 
the term of his imprisonment. Besides, an independent Austrian 
court, he said, was considering a possibility of the political 
asylum for Mahiz Javadov, one of the leaders of the unsuccessful 
coup d'etat.

<b>The Ruling Party Violating Law</b><br>
In accordance with the Law on Political Parties, no party or 
political organization has a right to found its local bodies at 
ministries, State departments, enterprises or educational 
institutions. Nevertheless, the ruling party "Yeni Azerbaijan" 
("New Azerbaijan") has set up its local committee (partcom) at 
the Administration of the State Railroad. The senior engineer 
and two deputy chairmen of the Administration have signed an 
appeal demanding for measures against interference of the party 
in the activities of the administration. According to the 
appeal, the partcom, following the worst Communist traditions, 
is endeavoring to promote party creatures to administrative 
positions.

Veruleishvili saw her son murdered in a road accident. Although 
she, as well as the police, know well the personality of the 
driver, for all this time the law-enforcement  authorities have 
been claiming him to be dwelling in Russia. He cannot be 
extradited, they say, due to lack of finances for his 
transportation. As to the second case, Mrs. Kaladze's son was 
murdered at home by two killers three years ago (as it turned 
out later they murdered him by mistake). The law-enforcement 
authorities are telling the same story: the murderers are in 
Russian and there is no opportunity of their extradition.

<b>Nobody Can Be Tortured or Commit a Suicide in the Fifth 
Isolation Ward</b><br>
Report about a press-conference of Kakha Targamadze, Interior 
Minister, October 29. For the first 9 months of the year, he 
says, the law-enforcement authorities have registered 8912 
crimes altogether, 7563 of them (84.9%) are already revealed. In 
comparison with the last year, the crime has reduced by 27.8%, 
including murders by 42.1% and robbery by 50.5%.  The minister 
blames Mrs. Elena Tevdoradze, Chairman of the Parliamentary 
Subcommittee for Penitentiary Reforms, for violating the 
presumption of innocence when reporting about tortures by the 
police. He claims the isolation ward No. 5, where the most 
dangerous criminals are confined, to be under strict control, so 
that there can be neither tortures nor suicides of the 
prisoners.

<b>Death Penalty Abolished?</b><br>
Interview with Elena Tevdoradze, Chairman of the Parliamentary 
Subcommittee on Penitentiary Reforms. The Constitution of 
Georgia, she says, provided for abolishment of death penalty in 
2 years. Besides, the death penalty is seriously impeding 
Georgia's entering the European Council. So, the parliament is 
to debate the issue in the near future. There are 50 sentenced 
to death prisoners in Georgia nowadays, she says. On the other 
hand, as Mrs. Tevdoradze claims, the penitentiary system of 
Georgia is not ready to substitute death penalty with a life- 
long imprisonment.

     <p>
<b>An Ombudsman Floating</b><br>
On October 28, the Bureau of the Georgian parliament crossed out 
debates over the nomination of Ombudsman of Georgia, scheduled 
for next week. Professor Rismag Gordeziani, the last candidate 
to occupy the post, had withdrawn due to his health conditions. 
The National Democratic Party offered Ms. Marika Baghdavadze of 
the Ilia Tchavtchavadze Society, but the other parliamentary 
factions rejected the candidate by reason of being unfamiliar 
with her personality. So the post remains vacant.

<b>First, a Gas-Mask Was Put on the Constrained Prisoner's Face and 
Then He Was Beaten by Truncheons</b><br>
Interview with Mrs. Elena Tevdoradze, Chairman of the 
Parliamentary Subcommittee for Penitentiary Reforms. She cites a 
letter of 21-year-old prisoner George Butikashvili, charged with 
illegal possession of a gun: he claims that he has found the gun 
on a road by chance, but the examination confirms that Kurdadze, 
the former Tbilisi procurator, was killed with just  this gun. 
Nowadays, Butikashvili, confined in the before-trial ward No. 5, 
suffers from asthma,  he also has a kidney removed after an 
operation. His letter says the law-enforcement officers regularly 
torture him: they put a gas-mask on his face to muffle his crying 
and wrap his wrists with newsprint when menacing him to hide the 
signs of the hand-cuffs.

<b>The Winner of a Trial in the Constitutional Court Arrested a Few 
Minutes Later</b><br>
Account of Tengiz Sudadze's trial in the Constitutional Court of 
Georgia, October 30. On August 9, Nugzar Nadaraia,  the mayor of 
Poti, banned the "Kolkh" company, headed by Mr. Sudadze, from 
building an oil terminal. The court declared Nadaraia's order 
contradicting the legislation: as the company signed the 
contract to build the terminal on October 18, 1995, and had 
already completed a part of the works by the time of the mayor's 
ban, it has the right to proceed with building. But just after 
living the court-room, Mr. Sudadze was arrested by the law- 
enforcement authorities. No official statement on the incident 
has been made yet. Commenting on the fact, Gia Meparishvili, 
Deputy Chairman of the Court, says he has no idea about the 
reasons of the arrest.

<b>I Am Afraid of My Police:</b><br>
Not long since, Irakli Gongladze burglarised Major Ramaz 
Eloshvili's, an officer of the Anti-drug National Bureau, the 
Interior Ministry, apartment. Gongladze accused Eloshvili's 
friend Kakha Kurashvili of providing the information about the 
valuables in the apartment. Kurashvili was arrested, with 
breaching required procedures (the police did not proceed their 
papers and the arrest warrant, while the detainee was conveyed 
to the police station being almost naked), and his wife beaten 
by the policemen commanded by Eloshvili himself. The case was 
forwarded to the Procurator's Office and from this moment, 
according to law, the ministry has nothing to do with it. 
Nevertheless, some officers of the bureau keep on summoning 
Kurashvili's relatives. Niko Japaridze, Deputy Head of the 
Bureau, refused to comment on the case and banned his inferiors 
to do the same. 'Let's give up being zealous democrats:', he 
offers journalists.

<b>The Educational System Prefers the Pose of the Ostrich (and 
Becomes Well-Off?)</b><br>
Account of some problems of the educational system of Georgia. 
While Tamaz Kvachantiradze, the minister for education, assures 
that studies in the first 9 classes (out of 11) of the Georgian 
secondary schools are free of charge, the school directors 
compel parents to pay for their children's education. 'Those 
discontented can go away!', one of the school directors said to 
parents, adding that he would increase the payment unless they 
gave up complaining. Such a situation can be observed in almost 
all the schools. At the same time, Mr. Kvachantiradze keeps 
saying: 'These facts, if really taken place, must be considered 
a crime, but hitherto we have revealed none'.

<b>Searching for the Legislative Field for Dialogue</b><br>
Report from the meeting with journalists of human rights 
activists Armen Hovannisian, Aghasi Arshakian and Vova 
Hakhverdian. Protection of rights of those arrested was on the 
agenda. Armen Hovannisian criticised numerous human rights 
organisations in Armenia working on the base of grants, but doing 
nothing. Then they presented the list of 109 persons arrested 
after the September 25 events. Presence of many names with 
"information not available" shows that the work on the list was 
not properly done. However Armen Hovannisian noted that this list 
was prepared in conditions of almost total absence of official 
information. There are well known persons on the list - MPs, a 
Presidential candidate, political activists, who have been freed, 
that is why, the focus has to be on the persons, about whom the 
information was not available.

<b>A Schoolboy Threw Himself from the Window of Dzerjinsky School. </b><br>
A woman called the newspaper, told about the event, and the 
reporter went to the school. According to the principal, two men 
from the military registration and enlistment office (voenkomat) 
came and asked to talk to one of the school-leaver, who was 18 
years old. As he saw them, the boy ran to the third floor, and 
then, seeing the approaching figures, threw himself out of the 
window. According to the military officer, he and his fellow did 
not do anything at all, the boy was so afraid that just jumped 
out of the window. The boy's aunt said the military men had come 
to their home at 6 in the morning. The boy is in hard conditions 
and will be operated on his head.

<b>Islamists Will Face Hard Days</b><br>
The Azerbaijani law-enforcement authorities have concluded 
investigation of the activities of the Islamist Party of 
Azerbaijan. Namik Abbasov, Minister for State Security, says in 
accordance with the legislation the case will be brought to the 
Supreme Court in a month. The investigation, he claims, 
completely confirmed all the accusations against the party. 
However, neither the authorities nor the relatives of those 
detained can specify the articles of the Criminal Code the 
defendants are charged with. A lawyer, who prefers to keep his 
incognito, claims that the defendants will be charged, along 
with other articles, with high treason (article 57, providing 
for death penalty).

the students, if the picket fails, the action will be kept on in 
front of the president's office.

<b>Lists of the Missed Detailing</b><br>
According to Pierre Dorbat (?), representative of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross in Baku, the ICRC 
offices in Baku and Yerevan are detailing the lists of those 
missed during the Karabakh war. Azerbaijan claims 1800 Azeris to 
be missed, while Armenia has provided the list of 250 its missed 
citizens. The ICRC will submit more accurate data to the 
leadership of the both countries. In the future, the ICRC is 
going to defend rights of the refugees after their repatriation.

<b>The Head of Administration Beat a Village Teacher</b><br>
The information centre of the "Mussavat" party claims I. 
Gurbanov, the director of village school No. 5, the Imishlin 
district, to have been beaten by A. Mamedov, the head of the 
local administration, in the latter's office. Gurbanov had freed 
the pupils of his school from compulsory harvesting cotton for a 
day when a bus to carry the pupils did not come. Mamedov ordered 
to arrest and convey him to the police station. After the 
teachers of the school threatened to go on strike, Gurbanov was 
released, but Mamedov summoned him to the office and beat him 
severely. Gurbanov is reportedly a member of the Council of 
Veterans, Chairman of the Union of Intelligentsia and Deputy 
Chairman of the regional branch of the "Yeni Azerbaijan" party.

<b>Refugees Returning Home</b><br>
Paolo Lembo, the UN Co-ordinator in Azerbaijan, has held a press- 
conference on occasion of  The UN Day (October 24). He said the 
basements of the cottages for refugees were to be set up in the 
liberated Agdam and Fizuli districts just that day. After the 
press-conference, Mr. Lembo and Vice-Premier Azad Sharifov
signed an agreement on "the first stage of reconstructing works 
on the liberated territories". The agreement provides for 
creation of a special agency to control the reconstruction. The 
UN Development Program and the World Bank have allocated 
$3,300,000 to this project, the first $500,000 will be received 
in a few days.

<b>Tombs of the Party Leader's Parents Defiled</b><br>
On October 20, the Board of the Party for National Ideology made 
an official statement condemning defilement of the tombs of the 
party leader Zurab Gagnidze's parents. Mr. Gagnidze tells the 
newspaper that on October 19 he found his parents' tombs defiled. 
The board blames 'modern Vandals and fundamentalists' 
discontented with the party's new, pro-Shevardnadze course, for 
the incident, while Gagnidze claims some women, Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia's supporters, to be responsible for the defilement.

<b>Don't Blame the Law-Enforcement Authorities for Suppressive 
Methods</b><br>
Account of a press-conference of Kakha Targamadze, Minister of 
Interior, and Jamlet Babilashvili, Procurator General of 
Georgia, October 18. Nowadays, there are no political prisoners 
in Georgia, they say, all those claiming themselves to be are in 
fact criminals. In Mr. Targamadze's words, the police will keep 
breaking up protest actions by truncheons until every citizen 
obeys the law. The police, he says, are the very state 
authorities empowered to apply force in due course. As to the 
Georgian police, the minister claims them to be much more 
liberal compared with those in foreign countries.

<b>Will Refugees Take Part in the Coming Parliamentary Elections in 
Abkhazia?</b><br>
Interview with Kakha Chitaia, Chairman of the Parliamentary 
Foreign Committee. He disapproves of the refugees' participating 
in the coming parliamentary elections in Abkhazia even though 
the elections are held under the auspices of the UN (the Bosnian 
model). In his opinion, the results of such a scenario are 
completely unpredictable. For instance, the Abkhazian 
separatists may declare the elections outside Abkhazia to have 
been gerrymandered. Thus, it will be harder for the Georgian 
leadership to insist on the unlegitimacy of the Sukhumi 
authorities.

<b>Three Georgian Soldiers Have Hung Themselves</b><br>
Report about a press-conference of the organisation for 
protection of soldiers' rights, October 22. Among the problems 
of the army there is a rather low-caloric diet: 1500 calories 
instead of needed 4000. Worse still, the rate of mortality in 
the army has increased in recent times: 7 soldiers have been 
lost since the beginning of the year, 3 of them hanged 
themselves because of extremely hard conditions.

<b>Listen to Us or We Will Declare Mass Disobedience</b><br>
Report about a press-conference in Tbilisi State University, 
focused on the problem of the Black Sea International University 
(so-called Turkish University), October 22. Participants of the 
press-conference were rather negative towards the Turkish 
University. 'The more Georgians learn the Turkish language, the 
easier Turkey will complete its tasks in Georgia', Irina 
Gotsiridze, an expert on Turkey, claims. The participants 
declared their readiness for street protest actions ('we have 
appealed to the authorities ten times without any result') 
demanding to put off matriculation to the university. They also 
cite Demuri Mikadze, Chief of the Tbilisi Police, who had said 
to them (as they claim): 'I'm too against the university. You 
must stand firm and act just like your comrades acted defending 
the Georgian language' (in 1978, Georgian students launched a 
protest demonstration and compelled then government to turn down 
a project of the Communist Party to make Russian an official 
language of Georgia).

<b>The Statistics Gives Rise to Particular and Common Questions The </b><br>
newspaper appeals to the Georgian  authorities for their 
comments on the following statistics: in the first 6 months of 
the year the law-enforcement authorities have registered 7222 
crimes; 344 of them were committed by the underage (by 59 cases 
more than in the last year). Besides, the number of underage 
beggars has increased dramatically in recent times: in October 
14-21, only in one of the districts of Tbilisi, the police have 
revealed 46 children-beggars.

<b>An Aid to Help Nobody</b><br>
Interview with Ms. Tsitso Bakuradze, Deputy Head of the 
Department for Living Standards, the Ministry of Labour and 
Social Protection. The precise number of the destitute in 
Georgia, she claims, will become clear after all the citizens 
formally appeal to the ministry for social protection. 'We 
expect the number to be more than 120 thousands', she says. The 
ministry has developed a project of social protection providing 
for three categories of the destitute: the first one embodies 
single pensioners (if their pension is the only source of their 
income); the second - the other pensioners and the students 
below 18 years of age; the third - the families residing in 
towns if all the members are unemployed.

<b>A Delegation from Tsalka Complains of the Local Administration </b><br>
About 50 residents of the Tsalka district of Georgia (populated 
mostly by ethnic Azeris and Greeks) have been holding a protest 
action in front of the State Office since October 22. They are 
demanding to dismiss George Kvaliashvili, the head of the local 
administration. Embezzlement of the humanitarian aid; wrong 
policy in the land reform; sharp deficit of the electricity, 
despite regular payments: this is a brief list of the problems 
the locals complain about.

<FONT SIZE=+2><b>M</b></FONT>ass killings, torture and disappearances
  shame the entire 
  international community.<p>
  Responsibility for these outrages does not lie only with those 
  who pull the trigger or apply the electric shock. It also lies with 
  governments which supply arms and equipment used to torture, 
  maim and kill.<p>
  These governments put profits and political advantage ahead of 
  human rights. Regardless of the consequences they allow weapons 
  to be supplied to forces with a record of abusing human rights. 
  They should be held accountable when this equipment is used to 
  commit atrocities.<p>
  The Amnesty International Report, covering 146 countries, 
  exposes human rights abuses in every region of the world. 
  Arbitrary killings by government forces and armed opposition 
  groups go unpunished and unchecked. Torture is rife. Prisoners of 
  conscience are confined behind bars. Political prisoners face 
  trials that are a travesty of justice -- or are jailed with no trial 
  at all. This report is part of Amnesty International's worldwide 
  campaign to bring these abuses to an end.

    Governments worldwide continued to extrajudicially execute,  
  disappear , 
    torture and execute their citizens in massive numbers 
  throughout 1995, 
    while thousands of prisoners remained in detention after 
  blatantly unfair 
    trials, or without being charged with an offence at all. Amnesty 
    International s report documents these human rights violations 
  in 146 
    countries.<p>
       Despite embracing the language of human rights, in reality 
    governments showed little inclination to protect the rights of 
  their citizens. 
    In September 1995, leaders attending the United Nations Fourth 
  World 
    Conference on Women agreed to protect women s human rights, 
  yet their 
    security forces continued to violate women s human rights with 
    impunity.<p>
       These governments around the world continued to kill and 
  torture by 
    proxy, often setting up, training, arming and providing 
  protection for 
    paramilitary groups. Death squads carried out governments  
  dirty work for 
    them, and allowed those in power to deny responsibility for 
  gross human 
    rights violations.<p>
       Armed opposition groups were also responsible for widespread 
  human 
    rights abuses against civilians, often targeting children, women 
  and the 
    elderly. These groups were frequently armed by government 
  allies around 
    the world.<p>
       Amnesty International s report highlights the trade in 
  instruments of 
    torture and how governments continue to permit the sale of 
  weapons to 
    countries well known as persistent violators of human rights.  
  <p>
        Responsibility for human rights abuses does not lie only with 
  those 
    who pull the trigger or apply the electric shock,  Amnesty 
  International s 
    report said.  It also lies with those who supply the equipment 
  and the 
    training needed to use it.  <p>
       Amnesty International s report calls on governments to cease 
  trading 
    in terror, by banning the sale of torture equipment or security 
  equipment to 
    any state where there is evidence that will be 
  misused.

  <CENTER><H2><p><h2> Human rights violations in Africa<br>
    January to December 1995<p> SUMMARY</h2></center>
  </CENTER></H2>
    Ongoing human rights violations in Sub-Saharan Africa were the 
  cause of 
    refugee flows in at least eight African countries. Continuing 
  conflicts 
    added tens of thousands of new refugees and internally 
  displaced 
    persons to the millions of people who had fled from fighting in 
    Burundi, Rwanda, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Sudan and Somalia in 
    previous years. In 1995, the number of refugees and internally 
    displaced reached more than eight and a half million people.<p>
       The unresolved tensions underlying the genocide in Rwanda of 
  1994 
    and the continuing massacres in Burundi and Rwanda exacerbated 
    the ethnic tensions in Central Africa. Nearly two million 
  Rwandese 
    refugees, mostly Hutu, remained in exile in Burundi, Tanzania, 
  and 
    Zaire. The governments of Tanzania and Zaire expressed 
  increasing 
    impatience at the burden of hosting hundreds of thousands of 
    refugees. <p>
       In mid-August the Zairian authorities threatened to forcibly 
  deport 
    more than one million Rwandese and tens of thousands of 
  Burundi 
    refugees. About 13,000 Rwandese and 2,000 Burundi refugees 
  were 
    forcibly returned, before international pressure halted 
  repatriation. 
    Earlier, in April, some refugees forcibly sent back to Burundi by 
  the 
    Tanzanian security forces had allegedly been killed by Burundi 
    soldiers. The Burundi authorities forcibly repatriated at least 
  500 
    Rwandese refugees, including some who had already been 
  expelled 
    from Tanzania.<p>
       Civil wars or political tensions led to an increase in 
  politically 
    motivated killings,  disappearances  and other human rights 
  abuses 
    by armies and different armed groups. Widespread impunity and 
  the 
    fact that people responsible for extrajudicial executions were 
  rarely 
    brought to justice encouraged the continuing human rights 
    violations.
       
       The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, established by 
  the 
    United Nations (UN) in 1994 to bring those responsible for 
  genocide 
    and other crimes against humanity to justice, made slow 
  progress due 
    to limited funding and the failure of states to enact legislation 
    permitting cooperation with the tribunal. Amnesty International 
    repeatedly called on foreign governments to provide more 
  support for 
    this tribunal and to assist in the reconstruction of Rwanda s 
  judicial 
    system. <p>
       In South Africa, a commission to investigate  gross human 
  rights 
    abuses  committed between 1960 and 1993 was appointed and a 
    report by a judicial commission of inquiry into South Africa s 
  arms 
    trade recommended new criteria which would exclude sales to 
    governments which repress human rights. In Ethiopia, the 
  members 
    of the former government charged with committing genocide and 
    crimes against humanity was brought to trial. These trials were 
    continuing at the end of April 1996.<p>
    
       Members of regular armies as well as armed opposition 
  movements 
    were responsible for deliberate and arbitrary killings which 
  continued 
    on a massive scale in several parts of Africa. There were 
  reports of 
    extrajudicial executions in Casamance, the southern region of 
    Senegal where both government officers and armed separatists 
    perpetrated deliberate and arbitrary killings of civilians. In 
  Sudan, 
    the Sudan People s Liberation Army (SPLA) soldiers killed 
  scores of 
    villagers in raids. <p>
       In Burundi, Tutsi armed groups sometimes assisted the 
  security 
    forces in their unlawful operations against civilians. Killings 
  were also 
    carried out by armed Hutu groups. In Sierra Leone, armed groups 
    killed hundreds of civilians while the government soldiers 
  summarily 
    executed captured rebels. Victims were often mutilated and then 
    beheaded.<p>
       In Angola, government opponents were killed in circumstances 
    suggesting that they may have been victims of extrajudicial 
    executions. The armed opposition Uni[a~]o Nacional para a 
    IndependE[^]ncia Total de Angola (UNITA), National Union for the 
  Total 
    Independence of Angola, killed captured soldiers and civilians. It 
  also 
    reportedly ordered the execution of an unknown number of people 
  for 
    alleged killings. <p>
       The proliferation of armed groups in Africa and the complex 
  nature of 
    their relationship to state forces did not always allow for a 
  clear 
    distinction between armed opposition groups and governmental 
    agents. In Sierra Leone, it was impossible in many cases to 
  attribute 
    responsibility for specific abuses: attackers almost always 
  wore army 
    uniforms but it was often unclear whether they were rebels or 
    government soldiers acting under orders or committing crimes 
  on 
    their own account.<p>
       There were frequent reports of  disappearances  in Burundi and 
    Rwanda and the fate of thousands of people who  disappeared  in 
    previous years remained unknown in Angola, Eritrea, Ethiopia 
    and Sudan.<p>
       In Ethiopia, more than 1,500 officials of the pre-1991 
  government 
    continued to be detained without charge. Hundreds of opponents 
  of 
    the current government, including many suspected of supporting 
  the 
    armed opposition group, Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), arrested 
  for 
    alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, were detained 
    without trial in different areas. Some appeared to be prisoners 
  of 
    conscience. <p>
       In Sudan, hundreds of people, many of them prisoners of 
  conscience, 
    were arrested, including members of banned political parties, 
  trade 
    unionists, lawyers, students, southern Sudanese and refugees. 
  Most 
    were detained without charge or trial for periods ranging from a 
  few 
    days to a few months. Following violent street protests about 
  social 
    conditions, the authorities arrested scores of political 
  opponents. In 
    Nigeria, suspected opponents of the government were detained 
    during the year, including human rights activists, pro-democracy 
    activists, journalists and members of the Ogoni ethnic group. 
  Several 
    prisoners of conscience arrested in previous years remained 
    imprisoned. Other countries such as Cameroon, Chad, Senegal 
    and Zaire also jailed scores of political prisoners, some of 
  whom were 
    prisoners of conscience. <p>
       There were two major unfair political trials in Nigeria during 
  a year 
    that witnessed unprecented international criticism of the 
  military 
    government s human rights record. Ken 
    Saro-Wiwa and eight other members of the Ogoni ethnic group 
  were 
    convicted of murder and executed in November, following 
  judicial 
    proceedings which were manifestly unfair. More than 40 people, 
    including prominent human rights defenders and a former head of 
    state, were convicted of treason in unfair secret military trials 
  for 
    alleged involvement in a coup plot. <p>
       In Kenya, the trial of a human rights activist, Koigi wa 
  Wamwere, and 
    three others ended abruptly in July when both the defence 
  counsel 
    and the defendants themselves were denied the right to present 
  their 
    final submissions orally. Observers from Amnesty International 
    attending this trial expressed serious concerns about the 
  impartiality 
    of the court. In October, Koigi wa Wamwere was sentenced with 
  two 
    others to four years imprisonment and six strokes of the 
  cane.<p>
       In Sudan, floggings were imposed as a form of judicial 
  punishment. 
    Many of the victims were women convicted after unfair trials. In 
    Somalia, Islamic courts inflicted cruel, inhuman and degrading 
    punishments such as amputations and flogging. More than 20 
  people 
    had limbs amputated. In Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, courts 
    continued to impose sentences of caning as punishment.<p>
       Cases of torture and ill-treatment were recorded in many 
  African 
    countries. In Equatorial Guinea torture of political detainees 
  was 
    widespread. Several of them said they had each been held naked, 
    some for up to a month, inside a locked cupboard measuring 70 
  cm 
    by 50cm. They were deprived of food and at night they were 
    suspended from poles and beaten. In Kenya, the authorities had 
    apparently avoided bringing some detainees to court to prevent 
    evidence of torture coming to light. Others died apparently as a 
  result 
    of police torture. In South Africa cases of electric shock, 
  suffocation 
    and other forms of torture by members of police investigation 
  units 
    were documented. In Chad, four people died in custody as a 
  result of 
    torture. Reports of torture and ill-treatment of prisoners were 
  also 
    received from Senegal.<p>
       Conditions in prisons and detention centres in Rwanda were 
  life-
    threatening. In the beginning of 1995, seven prisoners in Kigali 
  Prison 
    were reportedly dying every day. Gitarama Prison, which was 
  built for 
    600 inmates, held 6,847 when Amnesty International delegates 
  visited 
    it in June. In Kenya, more than 819 prisoners died, mainly from 
    infectious diseases resulting from overcrowding and frequent 
  shortages 
    of food, clean water and basic medication. In Cameroon, many 
    prisons reportedly provided no medicines at all. Prison 
  conditions 
    and inhuman treatment led to at least 16 deaths in custody in 
    Guinea.<p>
       In 1995, the constitutional Court in South Africa ruled that 
  the 
    death penalty violates the right to life and Mauritius passed a 
  law 
    abolishing the death penalty. However, more than 12 African 
    countries sentenced people to death. In Kenya, more than 500 
  people 
    were under this sentence. Executions took place in at least 
  seven 
    countries. In Botswana, the death penalty was applied for the 
  first 
    time in eight years. One execution took place in Zimbabwe, the 
  first 
    for seven years. Gambia reintroduced capital punishment and 
  C“te 
    d Ivoire passed a new law extending its scope to different 
    offences.<p>
       At least 95 people were executed in Nigeria. The writer and 
  political 
    activist, Ken 
    Saro-Wiwa, and eight other Ogoni were hastily executed 10 days 
  after 
    sentencing, on the eve of the Commonwealth Heads of 
  Government 
    Meeting which was about to consider the human rights situation 
  in 
    Nigeria. There was widespread international outrage at the 
    executions.
       Women and children were particularly targeted in some 24 
  countries. 
    In Liberia, within less than six months, 652 women were 
  reportedly 
    raped by members of warring factions. In Sierra Leone, women 
  were  
    raped, and were among the many who were mutilated or killed 
  and 
    beheaded by rebels. About 100 schoolchildren were among the 
    hundreds of Sierra Leonean civilians abducted by rebels. Their 
  fate 
    remained unknown. In Uganda, armed opposition groups 
  reportedly 
    abducted at least 400 children. The fate of many of them was 
    unknown at the end of the year. In Sudan, scores of children were 
    abducted by government militia forces. Many were believed to be 
  held 
    in domestic slavery by their abductors.<p>
       In several African countries, moves towards peace led to 
  hopes for an 
    improvement in the human rights situation. In Angola, the 
  overall 
    level of violence was reduced owing to the peace agreement and 
    people displaced by the war began returning to their homes. In 
    Mozambique, the human rights situation was much improved over 
    previous years following the country s first multi-party 
  elections. In 
    the beginning of 1996, elections were held and peace talks 
  started in 
    Sierra Leone.<p>
       During the year, an increasing number of non-governmental 
    organizations worked to defend civil and political rights as well 
  as 
    social, economic and cultural rights.

    <H2><CENTER>Human rights violations in the Americas<br>
    January to December 1995<p> SUMMARY</H2></CENTER>
    The gap between what most governments of the region say and 
  what they 
    do to change the human rights situation widened. While the 
  language 
    of human rights has been almost universally adopted by the 
    institutions of the states, human rights violations are still 
  taking 
    place throughout the region.<p>
       Different patterns of impunity for perpetrators of human 
  rights 
    violations were present throughout  Latin-America. In Colombia, 
    almost total impunity continued to prevail in judicial 
  investigations 
    into extrajudicial executions,  disappearances , and torture by 
  the 
    armed forces. In Peru, thousands of unresolved cases of human 
  rights 
    violations perpetrated by members of the security forces and 
    government officials over the past 15 years were definitively 
  closed by 
    law. In Mexico and Brazil the climate of impunity in which the 
    security forces operate puts virtually all the population at risk. 
  <p>
       In Chile, military and civilian courts continued to close 
    investigations into past human rights violations, even though a 
    number of officers had their prison sentences confirmed, while 
    legislation that would contribute to further closing of such 
  cases was 
    discussed. In Argentina, new revelations by members of the 
  armed 
    forces regarding the fate of people who  disappeared  during the 
    period of military government (1976-1983) failed to prompt 
  judicial 
    investigations to establish the circumstances of thousands of  
    disappearances . <p>
       In Haiti, although President Jean-Bertrand Aristide expressed 
  his 
    commitment to ending impunity, little was achieved in practice, 
    largely because of slow progress in the much needed reform of 
  the 
    justice system. In Honduras, positive steps were taken to bring 
  to 
    justice those responsible for some past human rights violations. 
  The 
    first charges against security officers on human rights 
  violations took 
    place, and judicial proceedings were continuing at the end of the 
    year. However, in other cases little or no progress was made.<p>
       Extrajudicial executions and  disappearances  took place 
  during 1995 
    in at least 16 countries of the region. In Colombia, at least 
  1,000 
    people were extrajudicially executed; in Brazil, victims 
  numbered in 
    the hundreds. In Guatemala, more than 150 extrajudicial 
  executions 
    by members of the security forces and government-backed 
  armed 
    groups were reported. Many extrajudicial executions also took 
  place in 
    Nicaragua and Venezuela. In Mexico, 17 unarmed peasants were 
    massacred by the judicial police in a single incident in Guerrero 
  State. 
    <p>
       In Colombia, more than 150 people  disappeared  after 
  detention by 
    the armed forces, the police or paramilitary groups. 
  Paramilitary 
    forces operating in rural areas were also responsible for 
  numerous  
    disappearances  of political and community activists. In Peru, 
  nine 
    people were reported to have  disappeared  in 1995 and the fate 
  of at 
    least 4,200 people who  disappeared  in previous years is still 
    unknown.<p>
       Torture and ill-treatment were widespread in almost all 
  countries of 
    the region. In Mexico, extensive use of torture and ill-treatment 
  by 
    law enforcement agents continued to be reported, as in past 
  years. 
    Dozens of people were also tortured during and immediately 
  after the 
    operations in Chiapas State between 9 and 14 February, and as a 
    result of police raids on suspected Zapatista National Liberation 
  Army 
    members in others parts of the country.<p>
       In Peru, complaints of torture by detainees suspected of  
  terrorism  
    continued to be received. In a single arrest in August in the 
  Village of 
    Chalhuayacu, 41 people were said to have been forced to sign a 
    document in which they admitted to being  subversive . In Brazil, 
    evidence that torture was widespread and a common method of 
    extracting information from criminal suspects was confirmed 
  by the 
    Chamber of Deputies Human Rights Commission. In Venezuela, 
    widespread use of torture by the security forces was 
  reported.<p>
       In the United States of America (USA), there were deaths in 
  police 
    custody in disputed circumstances and widespread allegations 
  of 
    torture and ill-treatment by police and prison officers. Chain-
  gangs 
    were introduced in prisons in several states. In Jamaica, scores 
  of 
    prisoners on death row were reportedly ill-treated and at least 
  two 
    prisoners died in custody.<p>
       Prison conditions continued to be appalling in some of the 
  countries 
    of the region including Venezuela and Haiti and poor in many 
    others, including Cuba, the Dominican Republic and 
    Paraguay.<p>
       The death penalty continued to be used extensively in the USA, 
    where 56 prisoners were executed in 1995, the highest number 
    recorded since executions resumed in 1977. Two states - 
  Pennsylvania 
    and Montana- carried out executions for the first time in more 
  than 
    30 and 50 years respectively. In Cuba, two men were executed 
  and at 
    least three others were sentenced to death.<p>
       A worrying trend emerged in the Caribbean where several 
  governments 
    stepped up the use of the death penalty. Saint Lucia carried out 
  the 
    first execution in nearly nine years and Saint Vincent and the 
    Grenadines carried out three executions in one day after four 
  years 
    without executions.<p>
       Chile is one of the few countries in Latin America to retain 
  the death 
    penalty. While no executions were carried out in 1995, five 
  political 
    prisoners continued to face possible death sentences after a 
  military 
    prosecutor called for the death penalty in their cases. In 
  Guatemala, 
    the Congress passed a law extending the death penalty to the 
  master 
    minders and perpetrators of kidnapping or abduction, the 
    perpetrators and those attempting to cover up such crimes. 
  However, 
    the law was neither ratified nor vetoed by President Ramiro de 
  Le¢n 
    Carpio within the legally specified period, leaving its status 
  unclear. 
    <p>
       At least six countries in the region held prisoners of 
  conscience in 
    their jails. In Cuba, some 600 prisoners of conscience and 
  several 
    hundred other political prisoners arrested in previous years 
  remained 
    in prison. <p>
       In Peru,  hundreds of prisoners of conscience and possible 
  prisoners of 
    conscience remained in prison at the end of the year. In addition, 
    more than 5,000 people sentenced after unfair trials in previous 
  years 
    also remained in prison. Prisoners of conscience and political 
    prisoners were also held  in Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela.<p>
    
       Human rights defenders were victims of persecution, 
  intimidation and 
    death threats in most of the countries of the region, including 
    Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Guatemala, Honduras, 
    Mexico, and Peru. In Mexico and Colombia, dozens of human 
    rights defenders, including journalists, were threatened with 
  death for 
    criticizing the human rights situation in the country. Some of 
  them 
    were directly attacked for their activities. <p>
       In Cuba, human rights monitors who transmitted unofficial 
  reports 
    to the foreign media and to others outside the country were the 
    subjects of strong measures by the government. Independent 
  human 
    rights monitoring remained severely limited with lawyers,  
  journalists 
    and members of unofficial political and human rights groups 
  being 
    subjected to frequent short term detention and intimidation.<p>
       In Guatemala, journalists, members of human rights groups 
  and 
    members of the judiciary were intimidated, threatened and, in 
  some 
    cases, victims of extrajudicial executions. Women human rights 
    defenders appeared to be particularly targeted in Colombia and 
    Mexico. <p>
       In addition to human rights violations carried out by the 
    governments, armed opposition groups committed abuses in 
    Colombia and Peru. In Colombia, armed opposition groups 
    committed numerous grave human rights abuses, including 
  scores of 
    deliberate and arbitrary killings. At least 400 people were held 
    hostage, principally by the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de 
    Colombia (FARC), Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and 
  the 
    Ej‚rcito de Liberaci¢n Nacional (ELN), National Liberation Army. 
  Some 
    were released while others were killed in captivity. In Peru, 
  dozens of 
    civilians were deliberately and arbitrarily killed by the Partido 
    Comunista del Per£ (Sendero Luminoso) (PCP), Communist Party 
  of 
    Peru (Shining Path).<p>

     <H2><CENTER>Human rights violations in Asia/Pacific<br>
    January to December 1995<p> SUMMARY</H2></CENTER><p>
    
    Behind the Asia/Pacific s image of economic dynamism, 
  governments in 
  the 
    region were responsible in 1995 for torturing, extrajudicially 
  executing,  
    disappearing  and executing their citizens, while thousands 
  remained 
    incarcerated after unfair trials. Women, children and the elderly 
  were 
    all victims, and the ease with which perpetrators of human 
  rights 
    violations were able to escape punishment contributed to the 
    continuing climate of fear in many countries.<p>
       Torture and ill-treatment, often leading to deaths in custody, 
    continued to be a major concern throughout the region, with 
    thousands of victims including women, children and human 
  rights 
    defenders reported from Afghanistan to Australia.<p>
       As the civil war raged unabated in Afghanistan, hundreds of 
  cases of 
    torture including rape were reported. Victims were tortured 
  solely 
    because they belonged to a rival ethnic group, or to extract 
  money 
    from their families. In China, torture of political and criminal 
    detainees remained widespread, often to force confessions or to 
    intimidate and punish prisoners, with many victims tortured 
  with 
    electro-shock weapons. <p>
       In India, torture of detainees was endemic in every state, with  
  many 
    victims coming from underprivileged sections of society. 
  Torture was 
    also reported in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia and East 
    Timor and the Philippines.<p>
       Many people died as a result of torture or ill-treatment in 
  detention. 
    In Myanmar, more than 1,300 prisoners died as a result of 
  illness 
    and ill-treatment when they were forced to work on road 
  building 
    projects. Many of these prisoners were made to labour long 
  hours, 
    breaking rocks while held in leg-irons and denied adequate food 
  or 
    sleep. <p>
       At least 100 people died in custody in Mongolia, some as a 
  result of 
    starvation. Others died from illnesses exacerbated by 
  starvation, often 
    as a result of the unrealistic legal requirement that prisoners 
  must 
    work for their food. In Pakistan, at least 70 people died in 
  custody as 
    a result of torture, deaths which the police often tried to 
  disguise as 
    suicides. Prisoners also died as a result of ill-treatment in 
  detention in 
    Afghanistan, Bangladesh and India. <p>
       Twenty-one aboriginal people died in custody or during police 
    operations in Australia - the highest number since records 
  started 
    being kept in 1980 - and police reportedly continued to harass 
    relatives who were unwilling to accept official explanations and 
  called 
    for further investigations.<p>
       Many people were sent to prison in the Asia/Pacific region 
  after unfair 
    trials. China continued to jail political prisoners after blatantly 
    unfair trials - operating a verdict first, trial second policy. 
  Verdicts 
    were often based on confessions extracted under torture, and 
  some 
    defendants facing the death penalty were denied the right to 
  legal 
    representation or to be given advance notice of their trial. In 
    December, the prominent dissident Wei Jingsheng was sentenced 
  to 14 
    years in prison after an unfair trial, despite international 
    condemnation.<p>
       In Indonesia and East Timor, at least 20 prisoners of 
  conscience 
    were sentenced to prison terms after unfair trials and some 150 
    political prisoners continued to serve sentences of up to life 
    imprisonment after unfair trials in previous years. In Viet Nam, 
    members of religious groups were among those given prison 
  sentences 
    after unfair trials.<p>
       Amnesty International documented the cases of at least 5,000 
    prisoners of conscience or possible prisoners of conscience in 
  18 
    countries in the region, although the organization believes the 
  real 
    figure to be much higher. More than 2,200 of these are 
  imprisoned in 
    China and at least 1,000 in Afghanistan.<p>
        Sri Lanka held more than 300 prisoners of conscience, and 
    hundreds of possible prisoners of conscience and political 
  prisoners 
    were held in the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and Myanmar. 
    Citizens forcibly returned from other countries were among 
  possible 
    prisoners of conscience reported in the People s Democratic 
    Republic of Korea (North Korea).<p>
       Prisoners of conscience were among thousands of people 
  detained 
    without charge or trial in the region. China continued to detain 
    countless numbers of people without charging them with an 
  offence 
    or bringing them to trial. In some areas only 10 percent of those 
    detained under the  shelter and investigation  administrative 
    procedure had actually committed an offence.<p>
       Legislation allowing detention without charge or trial 
  remained in 
    force in India. Despite the lapsing of a terrorist prevention act 
  which 
    had been used to detain tens of thousands of people, many of 
  those 
    detained under its provisions remained in custody.<p>
       Region-wide governments continued to use the death penalty 
  for a 
    widening range of offences. China sentenced people to death in 
    massive numbers, with a recorded 3,110 death sentences and 
  2,190 
    executions in 1995, although Amnesty International believes the 
  real 
    figure to be much higher. China executed more people than the 
    known figures for the rest of the world put together, with the 
  death 
    penalty applicable for 68 crimes including re-selling value-
  added tax 
    receipts, speculating and profiteering and causing damage to 
  public 
    property.<p>
       Singapore executed at least 50 people - the majority for non-
  violent 
    drug-related offences. Despite the lack of official information, 
  there 
    were reliable indications that the real figures were much 
  higher. In 
    March, Flor Contemplacion, a Filipina domestic worker, was 
  executed 
    for murder despite international appeals for her sentence to be 
    commuted.<p>
       The death penalty was also used in Taiwan, where at least 15 
  people 
    were sentenced to death, some of them after unfair trials based 
  on 
    forced confessions. Executions also took place in Japan, 
  Malaysia, 
    the Republic of Korea, and Viet Nam. <p>
       As well as the high level of judicial executions, extrajudicial 
  executions 
    remained a major concern in the Asia/Pacific region. During the 
    continuing violence in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, 
    scores of people were extrajudicially executed by security 
  forces. Scores 
    of arbitrary killings took place during the escalating violence in 
  the 
    Pakistani city of Karachi. Extrajudicial executions by police and 
    security forces were also reported in Indonesia and East Timor 
  and 
    the Philippines.<p>
       Armed clashes between opposition activists and government 
    supporters allegedly backed by security forces increased in 
    Bangladesh throughout 1995. Several people were 
  extrajudicially 
    executed when security forces opened fire on a demonstration 
  against 
    police attempts to falsify evidence about police involvement in 
    custodial rape. Local human rights groups investigating the 
  killings 
    claimed that one of the dead was a 10-year-old boy. <p>
       Deliberate and arbitrary killings, torture including rape and 
  hostage 
    taking were just some of the abuses committed by armed 
  opposition 
    groups against civilians throughout the Asia/Pacific region.<p>
       The international community continued to turn a blind eye to 
  the 
    human rights situation in Afghanistan, where armed opposition 
    groups were responsible for human rights abuses on a massive 
  scale. 
    Women, children and the elderly were among more than 1,000 
    documented victims. Opposition groups were also responsible 
  for 
    cruel, inhuman and degrading punishments including amputations 
    and stonings. <p>
       In Sri Lanka, armed opposition groups committed offences in 
  the 
    context of the resumed conflict between the Liberation Tigers 
  of Tamil 
    Eelam (LTTE) and government forces. Many of those killed were 
    Sinhalese civilians living in the northeast. In May, 42 villagers, 
    including at least 12 women and six children, were deliberately 
  shot 
    dead by LTTE forces at Kallarawa, near Trincomalee. LTTE forces 
  were 
    also responsible for human rights abuses against Tamil 
  civilians.<p>
       Ongoing violence between the government and armed 
  opposition 
    groups in the Philippines resulted in further abuses. The Muslim 
    armed group, Abu Sayyaf, killed more than 50 people in an attack 
  on 
    Ipil town in April, and were also responsible for kidnapping 
  civilians 
    for ransom. Armed opposition groups were also responsible for 
  human 
    rights abuses in Cambodia, India and Myanmar.<p>
       There were some positive human rights developments in the 
  region. 
    Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the National League for 
  Democracy 
    (NLD), was released after nearly six years of house arrest in 
  July in 
    Myanmar. However, other leaders of the NLD remain in detention. 
    Political prisoners and prisoners of conscience were released in 
  the 
    Republic of Korea, Nepal and the Philippines. The Pakistan 
    government announced the establishment of a Ministry for 
  Human 
    Rights and in a rare move in Malaysia, the King granted clemency 
  to 
    a taxi driver sentenced to death.<p>
       The work of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 
  throughout the 
    region in 1995 continued to be vital in protecting human rights. 
    Hundreds of NGO members came together for regional summits, 
    participating in the parallel NGO form of the Asia/Pacific 
  Economic 
    Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Osaka, Japan in November.<p>
       In August, nearly 30,000 women and men gathered in Beijing, 
  China 
    for the Fourth United Nations World Conference on Women. NGOs 
    from almost every country in the world participated in the 
  largest 
    NGO Forum ever and welcomed the inclusion of human rights 
    protection in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. 
    Amnesty International called on governments to ensure the 
    commitments agreed in Beijing were followed up by concrete 
  action.

      <h2><center>Human rights violations in Europe<br>
    January to December 1995<p> SUMMARY</h2></center>
   The armed conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Chechnya and Turkey 
  continued 
    to be the major source of massive human rights violations in 
  Europe. 
    Torture or ill-treatment by police and security forces were 
  carried out 
    in most of the countries of the region while the death penalty 
    continued to be applied and executions carried out in most of the 
    countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Albania 
  and 
    Lithuania.<p>
       In Bosnia-Herzegovina the fighting continued until a cease-
  fire 
    agreement was reached in October. In November, an agreement 
    providing for a comprehensive peace settlement and new 
    constitutional arrangements was signed in Dayton, Ohio, by the 
    presidents of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia. Thousands of people 
  were 
    abducted by Bosnian Serb forces, many of whom were believed to 
  have 
    been deliberately and arbitrarily killed. Civilians were 
  deliberately 
    targeted by artillery, mortar or sniper fire, mainly by Bosnian 
  Serb 
    forces. Abuses against non-Serbs took place in Bosnian Serb 
  controlled 
    areas throughout the year, with people being beaten, threatened, 
    raped or killed in the course of forcible expulsions from Bosnian 
  Serb 
    controlled territory. Hundreds of prisoners of conscience were 
  held by 
    the various parties to the conflict. Most were detained solely on 
    account of their national group. Many detainees were reportedly 
    tortured, ill-treated or made to perform forced labour in 
  dangerous 
    conditions.<p>
       In Croatia, many Serbs who remained in the Krajina region 
  after the 
    area was retaken by Croatian forces in August were tortured, 
  ill-
    treated or forcibly expelled. Scores of people were 
  extrajudicially 
    executed by Croatian armed forces in the Krajina region and 
  Croatian 
    Serb civilians were deliberately targeted by Croatian forces. 
  There were 
    also reports of arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment in 
    Croatian Serb controlled areas and rebel Serbian forces 
  deliberately 
    targeted civilians in a rocket attack.<p>
       The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia 
    continued its work during 1995 and issued further indictments, 
    bringing the total number of individuals indicted by the end of 
  the 
    year to 52.<p>
       In Russia, human rights violations by government forces in the 
    context of the conflict in the self-proclaimed Chechen Republic 
    continued to be reported, including possible indiscriminate 
  killings of 
    civilians, extrajudicial executions, torture and ill-treatment, 
  and 
    detention without trial. About 250 civilians, including women 
  and 
    children, were reportedly killed by the Russian Federal Army 
  which 
    was attempting to capture the town of Samashki in April. 
  Several 
    allegations of rape were made against Russian forces in the 
  Chechen 
    Republic. In June, forces loyal to Chechen President Dzhokhar 
    Dudayev were reported to have killed at least 40 civilians and 
  taken 
    hundreds hostage in the town of Budennovsk. Despite a peace 
    agreement signed by Russian and Chechen negotiators in July, 
  peace 
    had not been restored to the region by the end of the year.<p>
       In Turkey, state of emergency legislation remained in force 
    throughout the year in 10 southeastern provinces where the 
  conflict 
    between government forces and armed members of the 
  secessionist 
    Partiya Karkeren Kurdistan (PKK), Kurdish Workers  Party, 
  claimed 
    4,000 lives, including those of civilians, during the year. People 
  known 
    to oppose government policy towards the Kurdish minority were 
    victims of political killings, some of which may have been 
    extrajudicial executions. There were reports of  disappearances  
  and 
    extrajudicial executions of villagers in the course of security 
  raids.  
    Disappearances  continued throughout the country and no 
  safeguards 
    were implemented.<p>
       There were reports of torture or ill-treatment in most of the 
  countries 
    of the region, including Bulgaria, France, Germany, Greece, 
    Hungary, Italy, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, and the  United 
    Kingdom.<p>
       In Russia, there were numerous allegations of torture and ill-
    treatment in detention, both in criminal cases and during the 
  conflict 
    in Chechnya. Prisoners awaiting trial were held in conditions 
  which 
    amounted to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, resulting in 
  one 
    instance in the death of 11 prisoners. Reports from the 
  autonomous 
    Republic of Mordovia indicated that torture and 
    ill-treatment of criminal suspects under investigation were 
  routine.<p>
       In Turkey, reports of torture by police and gendarmes were 
    commonplace in many parts of the country, particularly in the 
  major 
    cities and the southeast. There were reports of more than 15 
  deaths in 
    custody, apparently resulting from torture or ill-treatment. 
  Amnesty 
    International received an increased number of reports of 
  children 
    subjected to torture.<p>
       Fifteen countries of the region handed down death sentences 
  and at 
    least nine carried out executions, including Kazakstan, 
  Krygyzstan, 
    and Russia.<p>
       In Russia at least 16 people were reported to have been 
  judicially 
    executed and a further 34 who had their petitions for clemency 
    turned down faced imminent execution by the end of the year. An 
    estimated 500 to 600 prisoners were believed to be held on 
  death 
    row.<p>
       Ukraine officially committed itself to abolishing the death 
  penalty 
    and to introducing a moratorium on executions, although there 
  were 
    reports that death sentences continued to be imposed and 
  executions 
    carried out. At least 74 death sentences were passed in the first 
  six 
    months of the year and at least two executions were carried 
  out.<p>
       In Kazakstan 101 executions were carried out and in 
  Kyrgystan, 
    President Askav Akayev refused clemency petitions from 30 
  prisoners 
    under sentence of death. Although only one execution was 
    subsequently confirmed, it was believed that all 30 sentences 
  were 
    carried out in the following months.<p>
       On the positive side, Spain abolished the death penalty 
  completely, 
    while Moldova committed itself to introducing a moratorium on 
    executions and to abolishing the death penalty within three 
  years.<p>
       Prisoners of conscience were held in Albania, Azerbaijan, 
  Belarus, 
    Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Romania, Switzerland, Turkey, 
    Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Yugoslavia.<p>
       Conscientious objectors to military service were imprisoned 
  in a 
    number of European countries, including France, Spain and 
    Switzerland. In Greece, about 350 conscientious objectors 
    continued to serve prison sentences of up to four years. All were 
    prisoners of conscience.<p>
       Armed opposition groups continued to commit abuses in Spain, 
    Turkey, and the United Kingdom. In Spain, attacks by the armed 
    Basque group Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA), Basque Homeland and 
    Liberty, on the security forces and civilians continued 
  throughout the 
    year. Fifteen people were killed and approximately 95 were 
  injured. 
    Armed groups also continued to kidnap people, usually 
  businessmen, 
    for ransom.<p>
       In Turkey, armed PKK members were responsible for at least 
  60 
    deliberate and arbitrary killings. Villagers armed and paid by the 
    Turkish Government to fight the PKK and captured by the PKK 
  during 
    the course of attacks were frequently executed, in some cases 
  together 
    with their extended families. The Islamist organization Islamic 
  Raiders 
    of the Big East-Front, IBDA-C, reportedly claimed responsibility 
  for a 
    number of attacks in which civilians were killed and wounded. 
    The illegal organization Revolutionary People s Communist 
  Party-Front, 
    DHKP-C, was responsible for at least two killings.<p>
       In the United Kingdom, seven men were killed in Northern 
  Ireland 
    as  punishment ; six by Republican armed groups and one by 
    Loyalists. Four others were wounded after shootings. Reports of  
    punishment  beatings increased. <p>

   <h2><center>Human rights violations in the Middle East and North
  Africa<br>January to December 1995<p>SUMMARY </H2></CENTER><p>
    
    Armed internal conflicts and social and political unrest led to 
  appalling 
    human rights violations in the Middle East and North Africa. 
    Political detention without charge or trial, unlawful executions,  
    disappearances , torture and unfair trials were committed with 
    almost total impunity and lack of investigation by governments 
    and their agents.<p>
       Armed groups and militias suspected of operating with the 
    acquiescence of the authorities were believed to be responsible 
  for 
    killings, torture and other cruel punishments. Armed opposition 
    groups were an integral part of the Middle Eastern political 
    landscape, committing an increasing number of grave human 
    rights abuses without any accountability.<p>
       Political opponents, women, children, human rights activists, 
    journalists, minorities or religious groups were the main 
  targets 
    for state oppression. <p>
       During 1995, positive steps were noted in some countries: the 
    release of political detainees in Israel and The Occupied 
    Territories and Syria, the closure of the desert detention camp 
    in Ain M Guel in Algeria and the abolition of the State Security 
    Court and moves toward ratification of international human 
  rights 
    treaties in Kuwait. Nevertheless, these improvements remained 
    limited, and positive steps in Morocco, such as release of 
    prisoners of conscience and decrease in the use of torture, were 
    not extended to the Western Sahara.<p>
       In response to the outbreak of widespread protests calling for 
  the 
    restoration of democratic rights, the authorities in Bahrain 
    arrested thousands of people, including women and children. 
    Those detained included prisoners of conscience. Reports of 
    torture of detainees were widespread.<p>
       Under the Palestinian Authority, supporters of Islamist or 
    leftist groups opposed to the peace agreement with Israel, 
    journalists and human rights defenders have been detained, 
    frequently without charge or trial. <p>
       Despite the recent releases of at least 1,500 political 
  prisoners 
    including prisoners of conscience in Syria, hundreds remained in 
    detention, some of them years after the expiry of their 
  sentences. 
    Up to 80 Kurds were arrested during 1995 in connection with 
    unauthorized political organizations and hundreds of 
  Palestinians 
    and Lebanese nationals arrested in previous years remained in 
    detention. Most were held incommunicado and their whereabouts 
    were unknown. In Egypt, 54 prominent members of the Muslim 
    Brothers were tried and sentenced to up to five years  
    imprisonment with hard labour by a military court. They are 
    prisoners of conscience.<p>
       Detention was used in Tunisia to punish and silence political 
    opponents and their relatives. Hundreds of prisoners of 
    conscience, both male and female, were arrested and detained, 
    including Mohammed Mouadda, leader of the legal opposition 
    party, the Mouvement des Democrates Socialistes (MDS), 
    Movement of Democratic Socialists, who was arrested in 
  October 
    1995. In March 1996, he was sentenced after an unfair trial to 
  12 
    years  imprisonment.<p>
       In Egypt, thousands of suspected members or sympathizers of 
    banned Islamist groups were held in administrative detention 
    without charge or trial during the year under emergency 
    legislation. Dozens of lawyers arrested in previous years 
  remained 
    in detention. Hundreds of people were arrested after clashes 
    between the security forces and armed Islamist groups in 
    Benghazi and other towns in eastern Libya. Almost five years 
    after the end of the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, more than 160 
    political prisoners and prisoners of conscience remained held 
  after 
    unfair trials. <p>
       In Israel and the Occupied Territories, more than 200 
    Palestinians remained in administrative detention while 
  Lebanese, 
    some of whom were abducted in Lebanon, continued to be held 
    in Israeli prisons under administrative detention orders. More 
    than 200 detainees were held without charge or trial at the 
  Khiam 
    detention centre in an area of South Lebanon controlled by 
    Israel and the South Lebanon Army militia.<p>
       Thousands of people who  disappeared  in previous years 
    remained unaccounted for. The cases of thousands of detainees 
    who  disappeared  in Iraq and people abducted in Lebanon 
    during the civil war remained unresolved. In Morocco, there was 
    no further information on hundreds of people, mostly Sahrawis, 
    who  disappeared  up to 20 years ago. In Kuwait, the fate of at 
    least 70 detainees who  disappeared  after the withdrawal of 
  Iraqi 
    forces in 1991 remained unknown. In Yemen, the fate and 
    whereabouts of people who  disappeared  in previous years 
    remained unknown.<p>
       In Algeria, hundreds of people were known to have been 
    extrajudicially executed by the security forces and government-
    backed militias. Many were reportedly killed in their homes in 
    front of their families, when they posed no lethal threat. Such 
    killings appeared to be used increasingly as an alternative to 
    arrest. Some of the 49 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces died 
  in 
    circumstances suggesting extrajudicial executions or excessive 
  use 
    of lethal force. <p>
       In Iran, up to 10 demonstrators were reportedly shot dead in 
    Islamshahr by members of the Revolutionary Guards during 
    demonstrations in protest at price rises and inadequate water 
    supplies. In Yemen, seven supporters of the  Aden football team 
    were reportedly shot dead by the security forces in 
  circumstances 
    which suggest that they may have been extrajudicially 
    executed.<p>
       In Saudi Arabia, the judicial punishments of amputation and 
    flogging continued to be imposed for a wide range of offences. 
  The 
    majority of the victims of such cruel methods were foreign 
    nationals. At least 11 people were sentenced to between 200 
  and 
    1,500 lashes each, Mohammad  Ali al-Sayyid, an Egyptian 
  national, 
    was sentenced to 4,000 lashes for burglary.<p>
       At least 27 people, including 15 women, were sentenced to 
    flogging in the United Arab Emirates. The sentencing of Sarah 
    Balabagan, a Filipino domestic worker, to 100 lashes and one 
  year 
    s imprisonment provoked an international public outcry. During a 
    previous trial, she was sentenced to death for the murder of her 
    employer, who she claimed had raped her.<p>
    <p>
       At least 14 people were sentenced to amputation in April by a 
    court in Sana a Yemen. Five of them convicted of robbery were 
    sentenced to cross amputation of the right hand and the left 
  foot. 
    In Iran, numerous cases of flogging and several of stoning to 
    death were reported. A 16-year-old girl was reported to have 
    been sentenced to life imprisonment and to have her eyes gouged 
    out for the murder of members of her family. During the first six 
    months of 1995, several hundred army deserters and defaulters 
    in Iraq were reportedly subjected to ear amputation. Most were 
    also said to have been branded with an  X  symbol on their 
    foreheads.<p>
       Torture and ill-treatment continued to be widespread 
  throughout 
    the region. Torture of political prisoners was systematic in 
  Egypt 
    with commonly cited methods including the use of electric 
  shocks, 
    suspension by the ankles and burning with cigarettes. In Tunisia, 
    detainees continued to be subjected to electric shocks on 
  sensitive 
    parts of the body and immersion of their heads in water mixed 
    with chemicals and in Lebanon detainees were hanged by their 
    wrists tied behind their backs. In Jordan, reports of torture such 
    as beating, hanging from bars or sleep deprivation were received 
    and in Algeria torture continued to be reported.<p>
       In Israel and The Occupied Territories, Palestinian detainees 
    continued to be systematically tortured or ill-treated during 
    interrogation by the General Security Service (GSS). Despite the 
    death in custody of  Abd al-Samad Harizat as a result of violent 
    shaking, the ministerial committee which oversees the GSS 
    allowed the shaking of detainees to continue and renewed, 
    throughout the year, the extended use of secret guidelines 
    effectively allowing torture.<p>
       In areas under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, 
    four people died in custody in circumstances suggesting that 
    torture may have contributed to their deaths. At least 26 
    detainees died in detention centres in Egypt. According to 
  reports, 
    torture and ill-treatment, combined with poor hygiene and 
    overcrowded cells contributed to or caused most of the 
  deaths.<p>
       There was a sharp increase in the number of executions in 
  Saudi 
    Arabia. At least 192 people, most of them foreign nationals, 
  were 
    executed during the year and scores of prisoners were reported 
  to 
    be on death row. In Iran, at least 47 people were executed, some 
    in public. As in previous years, the number of executions was 
    believed to be considerably higher than publicly reported.<p>
       Armed opposition groups committed grave human rights abuses 
  in 
    at least seven countries. In Algeria, hundreds of civilians were 
    killed after being abducted or deliberately and arbitrarily killed 
  in 
    targeted attacks and bomb explosions reported to have been 
    carried out by armed opposition groups defining themselves as  
    Islamic groups . More than 20 journalists were killed most of 
  them 
    reportedly by armed groups.<p>
       In areas of Iraqi Kurdistan, Kurdish opposition groups were 
    responsible for serious human rights abuses as killing, 
  mutilation 
    and torture. In Lebanon, dozens of civilians were killed by armed 
    political groups, often in reprisal for killings by opposing 
  forces. In 
    Israel and The Occupied Territories, suicide bombings carried 
    out by armed opposition groups killed civilians as well as 
    members of the armed forces.<p>

ARMENIA - Human Rights Watch World Report 1997<br>
<p>
The government's crackdown on the political opposition in September=20<br>
1996 cast a pall on human rights.  Given the 1995 ban on the=20<br>
Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF), Armenia's largest=20<br>
opposition party, and fraudulent 1995 parliamentary elections, the=20<br>
1996 crackdown accentuated the government's intolerance of any real=20<br>
political opposition.  This crushing of opposition forces bore out=20<br>
Defense Minister Vazgen Sarkissian's September 25 warning that=20<br>
"After [the September 25] events, even if they win 100 percent of=20<br>
the votes, neither the Army nor the National Security and Interior=20<br>
Ministry would recognize such political leaders."<br>
<p>
In April, the Ministry of Justice attempted to close Azg, the=20<br>

the auspices of the diaspora Ramkavar party, which is pro-Ter-<br>

<p>
The Ministry of Justice refused to register the Committee for the=20<br>

MONTHLY CHRONOLOGY<br>
<p>
2 December: A delegation of Armenian government officials led by=20<br>
parliamentary chairman Babken Ararktsian meet with Chinese=20<br>
parliamentary chairman Qiao Shi and other officials in Beijing. =20<br>
The meetings review bilateral relations and discuss the expansion=20<br>
of governmental cooperation in science, education and commerce. =20<br>
The relations between the two countries have steadily grown since=20<br>
China first extended diplomatic recognition in 1991.<br>
<p>
4 December: The Armenian government reveals plans to import 1.1=20<br>
billion cubic meters of natural gas in 1997 under the terms of the=20<br>
state social and economic developmental program recently ratified=20<br>
by the parliament.  The state plan also envisions utilizing foreign=20<br>
expertise to modernize the country's natural gas transport system. =20<br>
Armenian natural gas transport and supply facilities have remained=20<br>
idled since their closure in 1992 as a result of the full economic=20<br>
and transport blockade by Azerbaijan.  The Armenian government is=20<br>
also planning to privatize its state gas concern, Armgazprom, with=20<br>
assistance from the European Union.<br>
<p>
5 December: Armenian interior ministry police detain several=20<br>
leading members of the opposition National Progress party for=20<br>
questioning.  Although the incident remains unexplained, the=20<br>
detention is apparently the latest example of the government's=20<br>
campaign to intimidate and impede the country's political=20<br>
opposition parties.<br>
<p>
8 December: President Levon Ter Petrosian and National Security=20<br>
Minister Serge Sarkisian meet in Yerevan with Russian Border Troops=20<br>
Commander, General Andrei Nikolayev, to discuss the status of=20<br>
Russian military personnel in Armenia.  The border troops,=20<br>
stationed along the Armenian-Turkish border, are chronically short=20<br>
of adequate food supplies, as well as fuel and spare parts for=20<br>
their equipment.  The Russian troop presence is based on the terms=20<br>
of a 1992 renewable bilateral accord whereby both countries finance=20<br>
the troops' deployment and operational needs.=20<br>
<p>
9-10 December: Newly appointed Prime Minister Armen Sarkissian,=20<br>
during a visit to the United Kingdom, meets with several leading=20<br>
European companies to promote greater foreign investment in=20<br>
Armenia.  The prime minister also meets with several British=20<br>
government officials and parliamentarians.<br>
<p>
10 December: The Armenian Supreme Court issues sentences in the=20<br>
"Dro" trial, condemning three defendants to death on charges of=20<br>
terrorism, drug trafficking and crimes against the state.  The=20<br>
three defendants are Armen Munjoyan, Arsen Artsrouni and Armen=20<br>
Grigorian.  The Court also sentences the remaining eight defendants=20<br>
to terms ranging from three to fifteen years imprisonment and=20<br>
orders the state confiscation of all the defendants' property.  The=20<br>
defendants included Artavazd Manoukian who died while in custody=20<br>
from internal hemorrhaging and lack of medical attention.  ARF=20<br>
leader and defendant, Hrant Markarian, was found guilty of=20<br>
possessing multiple passports and an unregistered firearm, but was=20<br>
not found to have any connection to the "Dro" group, thus=20<br>
exonerating the ARF.  The prosecution had claimed that Markarian's=20<br>
participation with "Dro" proved the ARF's involvement as well.<br>
<p>
10 December: On his first formal visit to Moscow, newly appointed=20<br>
Armenian Foreign Minister Alexander Arzoumanian meets with Russian=20<br>
Foreign Minister Yevgeni Primakov.  The meeting reviews the=20<br>
conflicting positions regarding Nagorno Karabagh during the recent=20<br>
summit of the organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe=20<br>
(OSCE).  Although Moscow remains committed to guaranteeing the=20<br>
territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and providing a limited=20<br>
concession of autonomy for Nagorno Karabagh within Azerbaijan=20<br>
proper, the foreign minister promised to continue the constructive=20<br>
dialogue with all sides in their mediation attempt.<br>
<p>
10 December: The representative of the World Bank to Armenia,=20<br>
Vahram Nersissiants, announces that the multilateral lending=20<br>
organization is preparing to extend a new loans to the country. =20<br>
The World Bank assistance, providing credits for the development of=20<br>
Armenia's legislative and educational sectors, would bring the=20<br>
total level of World Bank aid to approximately $500 million.<br>
<p>
11 December: In response to the death sentences imposed the day=20<br>
before on three defendants in the "Dro" trial, the human rights=20<br>
organization Amnesty International issues a statement demanding=20<br>
that Armenian President Levon Ter Petrosian immediately commute the=20<br>
sentences.  The year long trial has been the centerpiece of the=20<br>
government's campaign against the country's largest opposition=20<br>
party, the Armenian revolutionary Federation (ARF), and the course=20<br>
of the trial has been marked by several legal irregularities and=20<br>
the sporadic violation of the civil liberties of the defendants.<br>
<p>
11 December: In a reflection of the growing level of corruption in=20<br>
the reforming economies of the former Soviet Union, Armenian=20<br>
officials announce that some 200 state tax inspectors have been=20<br>
dismissed amid charges of abuse of power and bribery.  There have=20<br>
been serious incidents of state corruption, including within the=20<br>
ranks of the police and law enforcement structures and among=20<br>
customs and tax inspectors in Armenia.=20<br>
<p>
11 December: The Turkish foreign ministry announces that Turkey=20<br>
will no longer open its border with Armenia as earlier promised by=20<br>
Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller.  The statement adds that the=20<br>
border will remain closed until Armenia "respects Azerbaijan's=20<br>
territorial integrity" and until the withdrawal of Nagorno Karabagh=20<br>
forces from the occupied areas of Azerbaijan proper.  The Armenian-<br>
Turkish border has been closed since 1992 in an effort to exert=20<br>
strategic economic pressure over the fragile Armenian economy.<br>
<p>
11 December: The head of the Armenian Church, Supreme Patriarch and=20<br>
Catholicos of All Armenians Garegin I, meets with Pope John Paul II=20<br>
at the Vatican.  The Pope states that he hopes the Armenian=20<br>
Apostolic Church will eventually reunite with the Roman Catholic=20<br>
Church.  The Armenian church split from Rome during the 5th=20<br>
century.<br>
<p>
13 December: Armenia's new Prime Minister Armen Sarkisian holds a=20<br>
meeting with representatives of the banned opposition Armenian=20<br>
Revolutionary Federation (ARF).  The meeting reviews the prime=20<br>
minister's plan for the coming year and discusses the importance of=20<br>
involving all political parties and groups in a constructive=20<br>
attempt to resolve the country's tense internal political crisis. =20<br>
<p>
13 December: The Korean electronics company Samsung opens its first=20<br>
store in Armenia, adding to its presence in the former Soviet=20<br>
Union.  Samsung maintains distribution outlets and stores in=20<br>
Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. The company is also reportedly=20<br>
considering opening three other stores in Armenia.<br>
<p>
16 December: An official of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)=20<br>
announces that the Armenian government must make corrections to its=20<br>
economic program.  Specifically, the IMF criticizes the Ter=20<br>
Petrosian government's plan to allow a rise in inflation from this=20<br>
year's level of 10 percent to an annual rate of 14 percent for=20<br>
1997.  The country's fragile commercial banking sector is also=20<br>
cited as a systemic flaw, calling for immediate attention and for=20<br>
mergers and closures of some banking institutions.  The IMF also=20<br>
expresses concern over the government's failure to meet spending=20<br>
reduction targets set this year and its continued granting of state=20<br>
credit to the central bank beyond previously agreed upon limits.<br>
<p>
18 December: According to a new report issued by the U.S.=20<br>
organization Freedom House, Armenia is categorized as being only=20<br>
"partly free" by virtue of repression of the country's opposition=20<br>
political parties and their press and the less than democratic=20<br>
nature of the country's recent parliamentary and presidential=20<br>
elections.  The report, issued annually, is a world survey of=20<br>
governments and their patterns of democracy and governance as well=20<br>
as a review of each country's state of civil and political=20<br>
liberties.<br>
<p>
20 December: A recently formed U.S.-Armenian joint geological and=20<br>
prospecting company announces plans to drill three wells outside of=20<br>
Yerevan and conduct a seismic study of the region over the next=20<br>
five years.  The U.S. partner in the venture plans to invest some=20<br>
$10 million for the exploration and will launch oil production if=20<br>
any significant reserves are discovered.  Based on earlier surveys=20<br>
done by the Portuguese Parteko company and the British firm SPT,=20<br>
Armenia is expected to hold reserves of nearly 35 million tons of=20<br>
crude oil and 80 billion cubic meters of natural gas.  Any energy=20<br>
reserves found would be beneficial to the Armenian economy which is=20<br>
stalled by the paralyzing effects of the blockade of the country=20<br>
imposed five years ago by neighboring Turkey and Azerbaijan and due=20<br>
to the country's over 90 percent dependence on imports for its=20<br>
energy needs.<br>

MONTHLY CHRONOLOGY<br>
<p>
8 December: The Georgian defense ministry announces the dismissal=20<br>
of the commander of the Georgian Navy, Rear Admiral Aleksandr=20<br>
Javakhishvili.  The Georgian naval forces have been undergoing=20<br>
recent modernization efforts and have moved swiftly in the last two=20<br>
months to exert a more assertive role in patrolling the waters off=20<br>
the strategic Georgian port facilities along the Black Sea coast.<br>
<p>
8 December: In a clash with Georgian forces, three Abkhazian=20<br>
officers are killed and two others are wounded in the Gali border=20<br>
district.  The Abkhazian government reacts by criticizing the=20<br>
Russian military peacekeepers stationed in the border region for=20<br>
their inability to prevent the attack.  The clash is reportedly the=20<br>
latest in a series of attacks seen as a new military offensive by=20<br>
the newly formed units of ethnic Georgian within Abkhazia.  The=20<br>
Abkhazian leadership has accused the Georgian security forces of=20<br>
having trained and armed theses units.<br>
<p>
9 December: The Ajarian parliament issues a statement protesting=20<br>
the Georgian refusal to authorize the creation of a free economic=20<br>
zone for the port city of Batumi.  The Georgian government has been=20<br>
reluctant to allow such a move, fearing that the economic zone=20<br>
would "encourage separatism" within the Ajarian Autonomous=20<br>
Republic.<br>
<p>
10 December: President Eduard Shevardnadze announces a formal=20<br>
moratorium on capital punishment.  Coinciding with International=20<br>
Human Rights Day, the announcement further states that the=20<br>
government will propose amendments to the penal code prohibiting=20<br>
the death sentence for high treason and other crimes, with the sole=20<br>
exception of premeditated murder with aggravating circumstances.<br>
<p>
10 December: During the course of a meeting with visiting Russian=20<br>
Duma chairman Gennady Seleznev, Shevardnadze and State Minister=20<br>
Niko Lekishvili protest the Russian government's trade restrictions=20<br>
on Georgian fruit and vegetables, wine and tea products.  The=20<br>
Georgian government has recently complained of the serious lack of=20<br>
market access for Georgian exports, citing the decline in bilateral=20<br>
trade.  Georgia is currently only the seventh leading trading=20<br>
partner with the Russian Federation.<br>
<p>
11 December: Chairman Seleznev, meets with Georgian officials=20<br>
during his participation in the summit of the Parliamentary=20<br>
Assembly of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation in Tbilisi.  The=20<br>
Russian official, in an address to the Georgian parliament, states=20<br>
that the Russian ratification of the pending bilateral accord on=20<br>
cooperation and political relations depends on the Georgian=20<br>
ratification of an agreement on the stationing of Russian troops in=20<br>
the country and other concessions by Tbilisi.  In protest to the=20<br>
statements, the Georgian opposition National Democratic=20<br>
parliamentary bloc walks out on the session.  The Russian official=20<br>
also states that Moscow would like to open a consulate in Batumi=20<br>
"to safeguard the interests of the 30,000 ethnic Russian community=20<br>
in Ajaria."=20<br>
<p>
14 December: Opposition National Democrats parliamentary bloc=20<br>
leader, Beso Djugeli, calls for the impeachment of Georgian Defense=20<br>
Minister Vardiko Nadibaidze for his "destruction of the country's=20<br>
military-industrial complex."  The defense minister has come under=20<br>
fire lately in the wake of his dismissal of Georgia's Navy=20<br>
commander.<br>
<p>
15-16 December: Tensions between Georgia and Russia escalate=20<br>
following the seizure of a Ukrainian ship by Russian naval forces=20<br>
near the Georgian Black Sea port of Batumi.  Georgia's=20<br>
parliamentary defense and security commission chairman Revaz Adamia=20<br>
and border troops commander, Major General Valeri Chkeidze, condemn=20<br>
the action by the Russian military as a threat to Georgian=20<br>
sovereignty and warn that it undermines prospects for the=20<br>
ratification of the 1994 bilateral Russian-Georgian border treaty. =20<br>
Further complicating the situation, Russian border troops have also=20<br>
sealed the Russian border with South Ossetia seriously disrupting=20<br>
commerce and trade.<br>
<p>
17 December: Ajarian parliamentary chairman Aslan Abashidze issues=20<br>
a communiqu=E9 announcing that Ajarian security forces have secured=20<br>
the administrative border with Georgia.  The statement explains the=20<br>
move as an attempt to control the transit of armed groups through=20<br>
Ajaria into Abkhazia.  The border area has been used by several=20<br>
armed Georgian groups to enter Abkhazia and despite numerous=20<br>
complaints to Tbilisi by the Ajarian leadership, these groups have=20<br>
also targeted Ajarian civilians in the area.<br>

Committee for Human Rights and Democracy, citing, among other=20<br>
things , the organization's failure to provide copies of the=20<br>
founder's passports, which is not among registration rules.  The=20<br>
government continued to deny the ICRC access to pre-trial=20<br>
detainees, but granted unhindered access to prisoners of war.<br>

MONTHLY CHRONOLOGY<br>
<p>
2 December: An official of the Organization for Security and=20<br>
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Tibor Lakatti, is attacked during a=20<br>
tour of the militarized zone separating Azerbaijani and Nagorno=20<br>
Karabagh forces near Agdam. Azerbaijani security officials blame=20<br>
Nagorno Karabagh units for provoking the incident due to the=20<br>
"difficulty in distinguishing peacekeepers from Nagorno Karabagh=20<br>
forces."  Such attacks have occurred in the past, for example, when=20<br>
Azerbaijani forces fired upon a OSCE delegation touring the zone=20<br>
last April.<br>
<p>
3 December: The international human rights organization Helsinki=20<br>
Watch sends a letter to Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliyev=20<br>
protesting the Azerbaijani government's handling of the criminal=20<br>
case against former Defense Minister Rakhim Gaziyev.  The former=20<br>
defense minister, charged with crimes against the state in the=20<br>
military losses to Nagorno Karabagh forces during the May 1992=20<br>
defeats in Shushi and Lachin, has been denied visits by relatives=20<br>
and has been held in isolation without access to his lawyer beyond=20<br>
an initial meeting.  Gaziyev served as the defense minister under=20<br>
the government of Azerbaijani Popular Front leader Abulfez=20<br>
Elchibey, ousted from power in a coup d'=E9tat.  Following the coming=20<br>
to power by Aliyev in June 1993, Gaziyev fled to Russia but was=20<br>
extradited to Baku in April 1996 after repeated Azerbaijani=20<br>
demands.  =20<br>
<p>
4 December: Speaking at a Baku press conference, Azerbaijani=20<br>
economic policy advisor Vakhid Akhundov announces that Azerbaijan=20<br>
plans on shipping 800,000 tons of crude oil through the Baku-<br>
Grozny-Novorossiisk pipeline.  The Azerbaijani official states that=20<br>
the state oil company SOCAR expects profits of $100 million from=20<br>
these early exports, estimated to be ready for shipment sometime=20<br>
next summer.  Azerbaijani officials also reveal that the country=20<br>
currently produces nine million tons of oil annually and is=20<br>
planning on annual exports of 1.5-2 million tons.<br>
<p>
5 December: The Azerbaijani ministry of communications announces a=20<br>
new $43 million project to upgrade the country's aging=20<br>
telecommunications sector.  The project involves the Azerbaijani=20<br>
state telecommunications firm with investment by Swedish and=20<br>
Turkish companies.  To date, the country's telecommunications=20<br>
sector enjoys significant Israeli and Turkish investment as well as=20<br>
assistance in its modernization from the European Union's TACIS aid=20<br>
program.<br>
<p>
5 December: Representatives of the country's main independent media=20<br>
issue a statement protesting the Azerbaijani government's decision=20<br>
to revoke the press credentials of the parliamentary correspondent=20<br>
for the opposition Azeri Popular Front's newspaper "Azadlyg."  The=20<br>
Aliyev government has a record of continued repression and=20<br>
censorship of the country's media.<br>
<p>
7 December: Azerbaijani foreign ministry officials announce that=20<br>
they have requested that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization=20<br>
(NATO) stage a seminar in Baku to examine issues related to=20<br>
pipeline security and environmental protection.  Azerbaijani state=20<br>
oil company SOCAR officials have added that the country's=20<br>
ministries of defense, interior and national security are seeking=20<br>
European Union assistance in the formulation of a security policy=20<br>
to effectively guarantee the safety of the pipelines planned to=20<br>
export Azerbaijan's significant energy reserves from the Caspian=20<br>
Sea.<br>
<p>
10 December: Azerbaijani security forces arrest a former special=20<br>
interior ministry forces (OPON) commander, Yelcin Amiraslanov, on=20<br>
charges of complicity in the March 1995 armed uprising seeking the=20<br>
overthrow of the Aliyev government.  To date, some nineteen coup=20<br>
participants have been arrested.  The March 1995 uprising consisted=20<br>
of members of the elite OMON branch of the interior ministry and=20<br>
was brutally defeated by regular army troops.  The elite units were=20<br>
then dissolved by President Aliyev and replaced by a restructured=20<br>
division, now known as OPON, and returned to direct control by the=20<br>
interior ministry.  This latest arrest follows a recent arrest of=20<br>
the leaders of another coup attempt directed against the Aliyev=20<br>
regime.  The so-called "Generals' coup," was led by three high=20<br>
ranking Azerbaijani military generals and involved the former aides=20<br>
to ousted Prime Minister Surat Guseynov and former Azerbaijani=20<br>
Communist Party boss and president Ayaz Mutalibov.=20<br>
<p>
12 December: The Azerbaijani parliament formally approves the=20<br>
country's 1997 budget.  The $758 million budget includes a $163=20<br>
million deficit, an increase from last year's budget deficit of=20<br>
$117 million.  The Azeri economic and finance ministries announce=20<br>
that the deficit will be financed from the signing bonuses paid to=20<br>
Azerbaijan by Western oil companies involved in energy deals in the=20<br>
country.  The government also forecasts a two percent rise in the=20<br>
Azerbaijani Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  In terms of state=20<br>
spending, education accounts for the largest amount, followed by=20<br>
military expenditures and social security and health care.<br>
<p>
14 December: In the fourth international contract between=20<br>
Azerbaijan and a consortium of Western oil companies anxious to=20<br>
develop the energy fields of the Caspian Sea, representatives sign=20<br>
a new deal to explore and develop the offshore Ashrafi and Dan=20<br>
Uluzu oil fields.  This new contract consists of a consortium of=20<br>
Western companies including the U.S. firm Amoco with a thirty=20<br>
percent share, an alliance of California-based UNOCAL with 25.5=20<br>
percent and the Saudi Arabian firm Delta with 4.5 percent, the=20<br>
Japanese oil company Itochu with twenty percent, and the=20<br>
Azerbaijani state oil concern SOCAR with the remaining twenty=20<br>
percent.  This $2 billion deal focuses on the exploitation of the=20<br>
two fields which hold an estimated 150 million tons of oil and 50=20<br>
billion cubic meters of natural gas reserves.  The project plans on=20<br>
yielding its first commercial exports by the year 2003 and a peak=20<br>
of seven million tons of crude oil annually by 2007.  This fourth=20<br>
international contract is the first one to exclude Russian=20<br>
participation and brings the total amount of foreign investment in=20<br>
the Azerbaijani energy sector to $13 billion.  This project also=20<br>
stipulates a bonus payment of $75 million from each of the=20<br>
consortium members to the Azerbaijani government.  The deal must be=20<br>
subject to parliamentary approval, however. =20<br>
<p>
16 December: Ukraine, Georgia and Azerbaijan formally mark the=20<br>
opening of a new Black Sea ferry link between Odessa and Poti.. =20<br>
The new transport link is an element of a "Euro-Asian Transport=20<br>
Corridor" plan calling for the formation of a new regional=20<br>
infrastructure and transport network connecting all countries in=20<br>
the region.  The ferry link is vital to Ukraine due to its large=20<br>
dependence on energy imports from Russia.  Georgia and Azerbaijan=20<br>
hope to utilize the transit link in the export of oil from offshore=20<br>
Azerbaijani reserves in the Caspian Sea.  Additional elements of=20<br>
the regional plan include the construction a new railway line from=20<br>
Azerbaijan through Georgia, a new $300 million project to construct=20<br>
a 40 million ton-capacity oil terminal facility at the Ukrainian=20<br>
port of Pivdenny near Odessa, and the completion of the=20<br>
modernization of the oil terminal at Batumi on the Georgian Black=20<br>
Sea coast.<br>
<p>
17 December: Meeting in Moscow with Chechen government official=20<br>
Eduard Khachukaev, Terry Adams, the chairman of the Azerbaijan=20<br>
International Oil Company (AIOC), the operational arm of the=20<br>
consortium of Azerbaijani and Western oil companies involved in the=20<br>
multi-billion dollar project to develop the offshore energy=20<br>
reserves of the Caspian Sea, discusses the issue of transporting=20<br>
oil from Azerbaijan through the pipeline transiting Chechenya.  The=20<br>
Chechen government is now seeking a share of transit tariffs and=20<br>
fees from the use of the Baku-Chechenya-Tikhoretsk-Novorossiisk=20<br>
pipeline.  The use of the this so-called "northern route" pipeline=20<br>
for transporting Azerbaijani oil is essential to the viability of=20<br>
the multi-billion oil deal and is strongly advocated by Russia. =20<br>
Recently, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin met with the=20<br>
interim Chechen government led by Prime Minister Aslan Maskhadov to=20<br>
negotiate the secure use of the pipeline.<br>
<p>
20 December: The U.S. oil company Mobil announces a new plan to=20<br>
develop the Oguz oil and natural gas deposits in the Caspian Sea. =20<br>
The offshore reserves are estimated to contain 40 million tons of=20<br>
crude oil and 20 billion cubic meters of natural gas.  Negotiations=20<br>
on the details of the project are underway between Mobil and the=20<br>
Azerbaijani state oil company SOCAR.  Both the Russians and the=20<br>
Iranians are interested in gaining a share in this project.<br>
<p>
21 December: The operational arm of the 12-nation consortium of=20<br>
international oil companies formed to develop and exploit three=20<br>
offshore oil fields in the Caspian Sea, the Azerbaijan=20<br>
International Operating Company (AIOC), announces the completion of=20<br>
initial drilling in the offshore Azeri and Chirag fields.  The=20<br>
drilling of the fields by a Western firm marks the first direct=20<br>
Western involvement in Azerbaijan's energy sector since the=20<br>
beginning of the century.  Early production from the fields are=20<br>
expected to be ready for export sometime in early 1997 and will=20<br>
most likely be recovered from the nearby Guneshli field.<br>

MONTHLY CHRONOLOGY<br>
<p>
1 December: As the international summit of the Organization for=20<br>
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) looms, Azerbaijani=20<br>
officials begin pressuring Armenian government figures to soften=20<br>
the Armenian diplomatic position regarding the Nagorno Karabagh=20<br>
conflict.  Azerbaijan promises Armenia a share in the revenue from=20<br>
the multi-billion dollar oil deals underway between Baku and=20<br>
Western oil companies.<br>
<p>
2-3 December: A summit of the member states of the Organization for=20<br>
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) convenes in Lisbon to=20<br>
review the international security group's structure, charter and=20<br>
agenda of diverse conflict mediation and preventive diplomacy.  The=20<br>
54-nation OSCE summit places the Nagorno Karabagh conflict high on=20<br>
its agenda in accordance with its long standing attempt at=20<br>
mediation over the past several years.  A preliminary mediation=20<br>
effort is launched by a working group of eleven OSCE nations led by=20<br>
Finland and Russia preceding the full summit with talks between=20<br>
Armenian and Azerbaijani officials failing to reach any significant=20<br>
accord.  The summit's handling of the Nagorno Karabagh conflict=20<br>
remains deadlocked over Azerbaijan's adamant demand for full=20<br>
recognition and endorsement of its territorial integrity despite=20<br>
the Armenian call for a guarantee of the right of self-<br>
determination for Nagorno Karabagh.  The Karabagh position regards=20<br>
its need for effective security guarantees and the articulation of=20<br>
its legal and diplomatic status as its priorities.  To date,=20<br>
Azerbaijan has conceded to offer Nagorno Karabagh a "high degree of=20<br>
autonomy" within Azerbaijan proper, contingent on the return of the=20<br>
occupied areas of Azerbaijan currently held by Karabagh forces and=20<br>
the return of the Azerbaijani refugees to those areas.  =20<br>
<p>
3 December: The Nagorno Karabagh Central Electoral Commission=20<br>
announces the final results of the November 24th election in which=20<br>
President Robert Kocharian was reelected to the presidency. =20<br>
According to the official final results, Kocharian garnered 88.9=20<br>
percent of the vote, followed by Boris Aroushanian with 7.05=20<br>
percent and Hrand Melkoumian with four percent.  Total voter=20<br>
turnout reached 70,058, or 80 percent of the eligible electorate.<br>
<p>
5 December: The Nagorno Karabagh ministry of health appeals for=20<br>
medical personnel due to the critical shortage of doctors and other=20<br>
medical staff in the republic.  According to the ministry, many=20<br>
qualified medical specialists are serving in the defense forces and=20<br>
that the shortfall of doctors is not being met by the small number=20<br>
of trained doctors coming to Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia.=20<br>
<p>
7 December: Recently reelected Nagorno Karabagh President Robert=20<br>
Kocharian announces that he is retaining Prime Minister Leonard=20<br>
Petrosian.  The prime minister is now empowered to form his new=20<br>
government within the next ten days.  The new government is=20<br>
reportedly adding new emphasis on the need for introducing more=20<br>
comprehensive systemic economic reforms and the challenges posed by=20<br>
the republic's unemployed and pensioners.=20<br>
<p>
10 December: The Nagorno Karabagh foreign ministry and parliament=20<br>
issue statements sharply critical of the recent summit of the=20<br>
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in=20<br>
Lisbon.  The statements threaten a review of Nagorno Karabagh's=20<br>
participation in the OSCE-brokered mediation attempt in light of=20<br>
the summit's acceptance of the Azerbaijani position regarding the=20<br>
Nagorno Karabagh conflict.  The Nagorno Karabagh position=20<br>
specifically faults the OSCE's endorsement of the principle of=20<br>
territorial integrity over the right of self-determination.  This=20<br>
conflict of principles is the fundamental diplomatic dispute=20<br>
deadlocking the mediation of the Karabagh question. =20<br>
<p>
10 December: Nagorno Karabagh President Robert Kocharian arrives in=20<br>
France leading a delegation of government officials and ministers. =20<br>
President Kocharian meets with French Senator Rene Rouquet, the=20<br>
head of the French Assembly's France-Armenia friendship group.  The=20<br>
French parliamentarian, speaking at a community gathering with the=20<br>
Karabagh delegation, commends the will of the Karabagh population=20<br>
in seeking their independence from Azerbaijan and recognizes the=20<br>
right of self-determination of Nagorno Karabagh.=20<br>
<p>
12 December: Arriving in Stepanakert on a working visit,=20<br>
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)=20<br>
representative Anjey Kasprchik meets with Nagorno Karabagh=20<br>
officials to review the situation in the region and to discuss=20<br>
further mediation efforts by the international security group in=20<br>
the wake of the recent summit in Lisbon.  The meetings also discuss=20<br>
the security needs of the Karabagh population.<br>
<p>
25 December: The Russian co-chairman of the OSCE Minsk group for=20<br>
Nagorno Karabagh Yuri Yukalov meets with Nagorno Karabagh officials=20<br>
in Stepanakert during a visit to the region.  The OSCE official=20<br>
also met with the Azerbaijani president and some Armenian officials=20<br>
earlier in the trip.  During the meetings, the OSCE representative=20<br>
favored continuing the mediation talks aimed at reaching a=20<br>
settlement of the Karabagh conflict.  In a statement made at the=20<br>
OSCE summit meeting in Lisbon, the current OSCE chairman, Swiss=20<br>
Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti, adhered to a strict set of=20<br>
principles to settle the Karabagh conflict.  These principles=20<br>
consisted of the recognition of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity=20<br>
by the international community, the granting of autonomy to Nagorno=20<br>
Karabagh and the guarantee of the security of the Nagorno Karabagh=20<br>
population.=20<br>

MONTHLY CHRONOLOGY<br>
<p>
2 November: The Armenian Constitutional Court begins consideration <br>
of the appeal filed by the opposition presidential candidates <br>
Vazgen Manukian and Ashot Manoucharian over alleged irregularities <br>
and fraud during the country's September 22nd presidential <br>
election.  The appeal seeks to have the election results <br>
invalidated due to the allegations of widespread, organized and <br>
systematic fraud by the government resulting in the president's <br>
reelection.  The contest has led to mass demonstrations in the <br>
capital, protests by the country's opposition parties and a <br>
crackdown by the state authorities introducing a temporary <br>
suspension of civil liberties and a ban on all public gatherings.  <br>
The Constitutional Court is comprised of nine members, four of whom <br>
are appointed by the President and the other five by the majority <br>
pro-government parliament.<br>
<p>
2 November: President Levon Ter Petrosian meets with a visiting <br>
official of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe <br>
(OSCE) to review the situation regarding the Nagorno Karabagh <br>
conflict.  The OSCE official, Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja <br>
Halonen, reviews his plans for the mediation process of the OSCE's <br>
working group on the conflict, the so-called "Minsk Group," now <br>
chaired jointly by Finland and Russia.  During the visit to <br>
Armenia, the Finnish foreign minister also discusses the issue of <br>
bilateral relations between Finland and Armenia.  The OSCE is <br>
engaged in a renewed flurry of activity in preparation for its <br>
upcoming 54-nation, two-day summit to be held in Lisbon in early <br>
December. <br>
<p>
4 November: Armenian Prime Minister Hrant Bagratian resigns his <br>
post and is replaced by the Armenian Ambassador to the United <br>
Kingdom, Armen Sarkissian.  The appointment of the new prime <br>
minister, the fifth in the five years of the Ter Petrosian <br>
government, is interpreted as an attempt to ease the political <br>
tension overwhelming the country since the controversial reelection <br>
of Ter Petrosian.  The outgoing prime minister was initially <br>
appointed in February 1993 and had previously held the posts of <br>
deputy prime minister and economics minister.  Bagratian enjoyed <br>
the support and confidence of the international lending <br>
organizations engaged in supporting the economic market reforms in <br>
Armenia throughout his tenure in the government. <br>
<p>
5 November: Shavarsh Kocharian, who is representing Vazgen Manukian <br>
in his appeal to annul the presidential election results due to the <br>
voting fraud and irregularities, criticizes the court for <br>
"violating the principles of equality and transparency."<br>
<p>
5 November: In a show of solidarity with the jailed opposition <br>
Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) leader Vahan Hovanessian, <br>
eight protesters begin a hunger strike in Yerevan's Liberty Square.  <br>
The hunger strikers demand an immediate end to the government-run <br>
political trials of the country's leading opposition political <br>
figures, the release of all political prisoners, and the lifting of <br>
the government's ban on the activities of the country's largest <br>
opposition party, the ARF.<br>
<p>
6 November: Newly appointed Prime Minister Armen Sarkissian issues <br>
a statement promising his commitment to continue the economic <br>
reforms of his predecessor with "a new impetus and to uphold the <br>
country's independence." The new prime minister further adds that <br>
his economic plan will endow Armenia with a truly competitive and <br>
modernized economy in order to prevent the country from being <br>
overtaken by "regional economic and political forces."  The <br>
statements are aimed at easing the internal political tension <br>
afflicting the country since the recent tainted presidential <br>
election and the external worries over the state of the economic <br>
reforms marshaled by former Prime Minister Bagratian.<br>
<p>
7 November: More changes in the new Ter Petrosian government are <br>
announced with the resignation of the interior and foreign affairs <br>
ministers.  Interior Minister Vano Siradeghian, notorious for his <br>
connections to organized crime in Armenia, is appointed mayor of <br>
Yerevan by presidential order and Foreign Affairs Minister Vahan <br>
Papazian is dismissed from his post.  Both figures are prominent <br>
members of the ruling Armenian National Movement (ANM) and are <br>
personally close to the president.  Defense Minister Vazgen <br>
Sarkisian is reportedly retaining his post in the new government.<br>
<p>
8 November: President Ter Petrosian announces the final changes in <br>
the new governmental structure.  The powerful interior and national <br>
security ministries are consolidated into one power ministry to be <br>
headed by security minister Serge Sarkisian.  While the influential <br>
defense minister, Vazgen Sarkisian, retains his post, three <br>
newcomers enter the cabinet.  The former Ambassador to the United <br>
Nations, Alexander Arzoumanian, is appointed foreign minister, <br>
former communist party leader Vladimir Movsisian is named minister <br>
of agriculture, and former communist youth official Hranush <br>
Hakobian becomes social welfare minister.<br>
<p>
8 November: A jailed leader of the banned opposition party the <br>
Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF), Vahan Hovanessian, ends <br>
his hunger strike that he initiated on October 29th to protest the <br>
continuous delays in the government's trial targeting him and other <br>
opposition figures.  The Hovanessian trial involves a group of 31 <br>
opposition members charged with treason, terrorism and assorted <br>
crimes against the state.  Since their arrest in July 1995, state <br>
authorities have violated the defendants' civil rights and rights <br>
to trial and have been accused of inhumane treatment and denying <br>
the prisoners the right to medical attention resulting into the <br>
mysterious death of one detainee from excessive blood loss.<br>
<p>
10 November: Armenian President Levon Ter Petrosian is formally <br>
inaugurated and his newly reconstituted government is officially <br>
installed.  The ceremony proceeds, marking the start of the <br>
president's second five-year term, despite the pending <br>
Constitutional Court's review of the opposition's appeal claiming <br>
fraud in the presidential election.  Of the country's main <br>
opposition parties, nearly all of whose activities are restricted <br>
or banned, the Communist Party is the only one in attendance.<br>
<p>
14 November: The European Parliament adopts a resolution condemning <br>
the election violations, the government's undemocratic treatment of <br>
the country's opposition parties and its leaders, and the state <br>
repression of the media.  The resolution calls on the Armenian <br>
government to hold new elections in the districts where the results <br>
were seriously questionable and to return to the international <br>
norms of democracy and freedom by guaranteeing the civil liberties <br>
of free speech, free press and assembly.<br>
<p>
17 November: Angrily denouncing the arbitrary decision of the <br>
Armenian Constitutional Court regarding the opposition's petition <br>
alleging voting fraud in the recent presidential election, <br>
opposition representatives hold a press conference in Yerevan.  The <br>
Constitutional Court announced that it will examine the documents <br>
and returns from several questionable electoral precincts for <br>
suspected fraud but will hear from only one of more sixty witnesses <br>
offered by the opposition.  Moreover, the Court ruled that it will <br>
continue to deny access to voting records and tabulations in <br>
military units and supported the actions of the government-<br>
controlled Central Election Commission in sealing all of its <br>
documents.  The Central Election Commission, in its explanation to <br>
the Court, also rejected a report by the international election <br>
observers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in <br>
Europe (OSCE) critical of the election and documenting cases of <br>
fraud and voting irregularities as being "ill-informed" and a <br>
"reflection of private opinions only."<br>
<p>
22 November: The Armenian Constitutional Court formally rejects the <br>
opposition's appeal alleging voting fraud in the presidential <br>
election and certifies the election's results as valid and binding.  <br>
The Court decision, effective immediately, is final and without any <br>
avenue for appeal.  The country's opposition political parties <br>
respond with a uniform condemnation stressing that they have <br>
followed the legal avenues available for contesting the election <br>
and asserting that the court's verdict in no way legitimizes the <br>
election.<br>
<p>
25 November: Speaking at a press conference in Yerevan, Armenian <br>
presidential advisor Jirair Libaridian warns that Armenia will veto <br>
any document regarding Nagorno Karabagh submitted to the upcoming <br>
summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe <br>
(OSCE) that has not been approved by Yerevan.  The Armenian <br>
official stresses that the summit is the only effective avenue for <br>
negotiating a draft document on the political status of Nagorno <br>
Karabagh and any draft plan must include a definitive diplomatic <br>
and legal status for Karabagh with firm security guarantees for the <br>
Nagorno Karabagh population.<br>

MONTHLY CHRONOLOGY<br>
<p>
2-3 November: Abkhazian government officials report that armed <br>
Georgian groups have attacked Russian peacekeepers along the <br>
Abkhazian-Georgian border.  Artillery bombardments are also <br>
reported in the Abkhazian town of Gali.  Tensions are reportedly <br>
increasing as Abkhazia November 23 parliamentary elections near.<br>
<p>
4 November: The Georgian government denounces the Abkhazian <br>
elections as illegal and appeals to Russia to state their official <br>
position on the elections in an attempt to stop them through <br>
diplomatic intervention and pressure.  The United Nations, fearful <br>
of the election's effect on the stalled mediation talks over the <br>
conflict, has called on Abkhazia to postpone the elections pending <br>
the return of the several hundred thousand Georgian refugees.<br>
<p>
4-5 November: Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko meets with <br>
Shevardnadze and other Georgian officials in Tbilisi.  A series of <br>
bilateral agreements are signed including an important accord <br>
stipulating military cooperation between the two countries.  The <br>
Ukrainian delegation also discusses the strategic issue of the <br>
planned transport of oil from Azerbaijan to Georgia's Black Sea <br>
port facilities.  Given Kiev's significant dependence on energy <br>
imports from Russia, Ukraine is interested in importing Azerbaijani <br>
oil from Georgia and is seeking the possible creation of a regional <br>
transit network consisting of inter-state highways, railway lines <br>
and pipelines.<br>
<p>
5 November: A new committee comprising representatives of eighteen <br>
opposition parties is formed to advocate the complete withdrawal of <br>
all Russian military troops from Georgia.  These include troops <br>
deployed along the Abkhazian-Georgian border as peacekeepers and <br>
those stationed at the four military bases Russia leases from <br>
Georgia.  This new committee is similar to an earlier group, the <br>
"National Liberation Movement of Georgia," founded several months <br>
ago by members of fourteen opposition parties not represented in <br>
the current parliament.<br>
<p>
8 November: The deputy secretary of the newly reconstituted Russian <br>
Security Council, Boris Berezovsky, meets with Shevardnadze to <br>
discuss the latest situation in nearby Chechenya and to review <br>
bilateral relations between Moscow and Tbilisi.  Shevardnadze also <br>
reiterates his appeal for increased Russian pressure on the <br>
Abkhazian leadership as the negotiations between Sukhumi and <br>
Tbilisi have stalled in recent months.<br>
<p>
10 November: Results from presidential elections in the former <br>
Georgian autonomous "oblast," or region, of South Ossetia, show <br>
parliamentary chairman Lyudvig Chibirov winning with 65 percent of <br>
the vote.  Former Prime Minister Vladislav Gabarayev is second with <br>
a mere 20 percent.  Georgian officials, though characterizing the <br>
election as "unlawful," are pleased by the outcome due to <br>
Gabarayev's platform advocating secession from Georgia and <br>
unification with adjoining North Ossetia within the Russian <br>
Federation.  The low turnout for Gabarayev indicates a significant <br>
lessening of support for outright unification with North Ossetia <br>
and a favoring of the more gradualist position advanced by <br>
Chibirov. South Ossetia adopted two referendums advocating <br>
secession from Georgia in 1991 and 1992 and is currently engaged in <br>
negotiations with Tbilisi over its political status.  The Georgian <br>
government is offering greater autonomy for the independence-<br>
seeking region. <br>
<p>
11 November: Georgian Defense Minister Lt. General Vardiko <br>
Nadibaidze meets with his Russian counterpart, General Igor <br>
Rodionov, in Moscow to finalize the bilateral agreement providing <br>
for Russian military assistance to Georgia.  The agreement calls <br>
for the transfer of Russian armored personnel carriers, artillery <br>
and naval vessels to Georgia.  The Russian Defense Council has <br>
heralded this agreement as an important element in Russia's <br>
strategy to build a series of bilateral military and security <br>
accords throughout the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).<br>
<p>
24 November: Abkhazian officials announce that the first round of <br>
parliamentary elections have decided 30 of 35 seats and begin <br>
preparations for runoff elections for the five remaining seats.  <br>
Several hundred thousand Georgian refugees from the Abkhazian <br>
region are not able to participate in the elections, however.  This <br>
election represents a significant advance in the Abkhazian <br>
leadership's bid for independence, as it effectively replaces the <br>
previous Soviet-style legislature which split in 1993 into two <br>
rival camps, one favoring Abkhazian independence and the other <br>
supporting Tbilisi.  Georgian officials conduct a referendum for <br>
the Georgian refugees from Abkhazia resulting in a predictable <br>
majority voting to disregard any Abkhazian election held without <br>
their participation.<br>

MONTHLY CHRONOLOGY<br>
<p>
2 November: The Canadian A &amp; B Geoscience Corporation (ABGV) <br>
announces that its subsidiary Commonwealth Oil and Gas has signed <br>
an agreement with the Azerbaijani State Oil Company (SOCAR) for the <br>
joint development of an offshore oil field in the Caspian Sea.  The <br>
project is set to begin exploratory work on an offshore field <br>
estimated to hold 151 million barrels of oil equivalent (with a <br>
ratio of roughly 66 percent oil to 34 percent natural gas).  The <br>
Canadian firm has signed a production-sharing agreement with SOCAR <br>
and is expected to launch the first stages of the exploration by <br>
the end of the year.  This is the first significant Canadian <br>
involvement in the promising energy sector of Azerbaijan.<br>
<p>
4 November: Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliyev meets with Finnish <br>
Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen, visiting the region as part of a <br>
mediation mission under the auspices of the Organization for <br>
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  The OSCE officials <br>
reports that President Aliyev has offered a status of the "highest <br>
autonomy" for Nagorno Karabagh and pledges that Azerbaijan is ready <br>
to formally reach a political agreement with Armenia and is seeking <br>
to resolve the long-standing Nagorno Karabagh conflict.<br>
<p>
4 November: Azerbaijani presidential advisor Vafa Guluzade departs <br>
for an undisclosed European city for secret talks with his Armenian <br>
counterpart Jirair Libaridian.  The two officials have been <br>
conducting secret diplomacy through these types of meetings over <br>
the past few years.  The talks center on the latest developments in <br>
the international mediation efforts underway for the Nagorno <br>
Karabagh conflict.<br>
<p>
5 November: The chairman of the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE, <br>
Xavier Ruperes, holds a series of meetings with Azerbaijani <br>
officials during a visit to Baku.  The OSCE official meets with the <br>
Azerbaijani president and foreign minister, and with <br>
representatives of the main opposition parties, the Azeri Popular <br>
Front and the National Independence Party.  Ruperes is briefed on <br>
the Azerbaijani government's position regarding the upcoming <br>
presidential elections in Nagorno Karabagh which it condemns as <br>
illegitimate and a provocation threatening the mediation process.<br>
<p>
8 November: Russia announces a shift in its official position on <br>
the Caspian Sea to allow for a communal agreement among the <br>
littoral states.  Specifically, the Russian government is <br>
advocating the formation of a new exclusive zone forty miles from <br>
each country's shore with resources beyond that limit being legally <br>
shared by all five countries bordering the Caspian.  Iran, <br>
Turkmenistan and Russia are seeking this interpretation while <br>
Azerbaijan, whose extensive offshore reserves are well beyond the <br>
forty mile limit, strongly opposes it and Kazakhstan, with reserves <br>
within the exclusive zone, wavering in its position.  This new <br>
Russian position was first revealed last month but Russian <br>
officials have now intensified their bid to legalize this position.<br>
<p>
9-10 November: Officials of the French oil company Elf-Equitaine <br>
hold talks with officials of the Azerbaijani State Oil Company <br>
SOCAR in Baku.  The meeting seeks to accelerate the negotiations <br>
over the development of the offshore Lenkoran-Deniz oil field along <br>
the Caspian Sea shelf.  The project, for the development of an <br>
estimated 50-60 million tons of oil, is expected to be formalized <br>
with the signing of an official production-sharing agreement during <br>
the visit of President Aliyev to France in the next few months.  <br>
The French company is already active in the development of <br>
Azerbaijan's offshore reserves with a substantial stake in the <br>
exploration of the Shah-Deniz oil and natural gas fields.  Another <br>
deal between SOCAR and a consortium of international oil companies <br>
is finalized for the development of the offshore Dan-Ulduzu and <br>
Ashrafi oil fields, said to hold some 100-120 million tons of oil <br>
and 30-50 billion cubic meters of natural gas to be extracted over <br>
a 25-30 year period.  This deal consists of a thirty percent share <br>
for the U.S. companies AMOCO and UNOCAL and for the Saudi Arabian <br>
Delta company.  The Japanese Itochu company and SOCAR each hold <br>
another twenty percent in the project, with the consortium <br>
reportedly providing the financing for the SOCAR share. <br>
<p>
11-13 November: The Commander of the Turkish ground forces, General <br>
Hikmet Heksal, holds a series of meetings and briefings with <br>
Azerbaijani military personnel in Baku.  During the meetings, the <br>
Turkish military official states that Turkey is committed to <br>
defending Azerbaijan militarily in the event of any outside attack <br>
or aggression posed against Azerbaijan, as stipulated in the <br>
bilateral military cooperation and security in effect between the <br>
two countries.  The Turkish military is planning to provide <br>
assistance through joint training exercises and drills.  This visit <br>
follows a meeting between a delegation from the Turkish military <br>
general staff with Azerbaijani Defense Minister Safar Abiyev late <br>
last month.<br>
<p>
12 November: Convening a summit in Turkmenistan to discuss the <br>
legal status and definition of the Caspian Sea, the foreign <br>
ministers of Azerbaijan, Russia, Iran, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan <br>
reach a consensus whereby all five states bordering the Caspian <br>
resolve to sign an international convention on the Caspian shortly.  <br>
The meeting decides to form a special task force empowered to <br>
negotiate the final details and will meet in the Kazakh capital <br>
Almati next month.  During the meeting, the Russian, Iranian and <br>
Turkmen officials agree to expand cooperation in the exploration of <br>
the mineral and fishery resources of the Caspian.<br>
<p>
15 November: Azerbaijani opposition leader Nemat Panahov, the head <br>
of the National Statehood Party, is detained by security forces <br>
just prior to the start of a press conference in Baku.  The <br>
opposition leader is a former advisor and confidant of President <br>
Aliyev but resigned his post several months ago in protest of the <br>
government's "widespread corruption." <br>
<p>
17 November: According to Azerbaijani officials, Russian Security <br>
Council deputy secretary Boris Berezovsky has assured them that <br>
Russia will guarantee the safe passage of the early oil expected <br>
from the multi-billion dollar offshore energy project.  The oil is <br>
to be transported by pipeline through Chechenya to the Russian port <br>
facility at Novorossiisk on the Black Sea.  The security of this <br>
Baku-Novorossiisk pipeline has been a primary concern to Azerbaijan <br>
and the consortium of Western oil companies.  The need to secure an <br>
effective and reliable route for the transport of the oil from <br>
Azerbaijan remains a fundamental challenge to the long term <br>
viability of all energy projects underway.  Russian first deputy <br>
minister for oil and power, Anatoly Shatalov, has also promised <br>
that this pipeline route would be readied for the shipments of <br>
Azerbaijani oil by next year.  The pipeline through Chechenya, in <br>
need of an estimated (pre-conflict) $55 million in repair and <br>
modernization, is to transport 32 million tons of initial oil over <br>
a seven-year period starting in August 1997. <br>
<p>
20 November: U.S. State Department official James Collins meets <br>
with officials of the Azerbaijani foreign ministry during a visit <br>
to Baku.  Ambassador Collins states that the U.S. regards the <br>
development of Azerbaijan's economy and its energy sector, with <br>
significant U.S. investment, as a strategic concern for Washington.  <br>
The settlement of the Nagorno Karabagh conflict is also seen by the <br>
U.S. as a prerequisite for the establishment of Azerbaijan's <br>
security, according to Ambassador Collins. <br>
<p>
22 November: Speaking to reporters following a visit to Iran and <br>
Azerbaijan, President Mintimer Shaimiyev of Tartarstan, an <br>
autonomous region within the Russian Federation, reviews the recent <br>
bilateral accords reached calling for cooperation in the <br>
development of industry and trade with Tartarstan.  Both Iranian <br>
and Azerbaijani officials are interested in establishing new <br>
commercial ventures with Tartarstan, prominent for the production <br>
of Kamaz cargo planes and heavy trucks.  Tartarstan also has a <br>
growing petrochemical sector which is attracting significant <br>
foreign investment.<br>
<p>
23 November: Demonstrators gather in Baku to protest the <br>
presidential election in Nagorno Karabagh. The demonstration, <br>
seemingly organized and encouraged by the Azerbaijani government, <br>
consists of several thousand Azerbaijani refugees forced from their <br>
homes due to the fighting in Nagorno Karabagh.  The refugees <br>
denounce the election as illegal and as "disrespectful of <br>
Azerbaijani sovereignty and territorial integrity."<br>
<p>
24 November: An opposition demonstration is held in Baku to protest <br>
corruption within the Aliyev government. During the demonstration, <br>
plain clothes Azerbaijani security forces break up the rally and <br>
forcibly disperse the protesters from Baku's Freedom Square.  An <br>
Azerbaijani reporter is beaten by the police units after <br>
interviewing an opposition organizer of the demonstration.  <br>
Witnesses also report that the security forces assaulted several <br>
dozen participants and questioned some of the organizers.<br>

MONTHLY CHRONOLOGY<br>
<p>
1 November: The Nagorno Karabagh Central Electoral Committee <br>
announces that three candidates have been formally registered for <br>
the upcoming presidential election.  The three candidates, the <br>
current President Robert Kocharian, communist party leader Hrant <br>
Melkoumian, and parliamentarian Boris Aroushanian, have met the <br>
requirement for signed petitions supporting their candidacy.  The <br>
Central Electoral Committee chairman, Moushegh Ohanjanian, also <br>
announces that potential candidate Albert Ghazarian has been <br>
disqualified due to discrepancies in his petitions.<br>
<p>
4 November: President Robert Kocharian initiates his campaign for <br>
reelection with a tour of the Askeran, Marduni and Mardakert <br>
districts.  The president also meets with various units of the <br>
Nagorno Karabagh military and the faculty of Stepanakert <br>
University.  During the tour, Kocharian stresses his government's <br>
achievements, including the development of Karabagh's energy and <br>
communications sectors and the expansion of agriculture from six <br>
hectares of harvesting to the current level of over 40,000 <br>
cultivated hectares.  Kocharian promises to continue the policies <br>
of providing tax and credit benefits to collective and private <br>
farms in order to foster agricultural self-sufficiency, and to <br>
expand small- and medium-sized enterprises to provide more <br>
employment.<br>
<p>
11 November: International representatives of non-governmental <br>
organizations attend a conference on conflict settlement and <br>
preventive diplomacy in Stepanakert.  Participants include <br>
delegates from the Helsinki Citizen Assemblies of Ukraine, Georgia, <br>
Armenia, and the Netherlands, the International Committee of the <br>
Red Cross, and other European non-governmental organizations.  <br>
<p>
15 November: Articulating last month's reports of possible Central <br>
Asian participation in a settlement of the Nagorno Karabagh <br>
conflict, Kyrgyzstan's Foreign Minister Roza Obumbayeva states that <br>
troops from the Central Asian states may participate in the <br>
deployment of international peacekeepers, but only on the <br>
precondition that a peace treaty is signed between Armenia and <br>
Azerbaijan first.<br>
<p>
16 November: Negotiations over the exchange of prisoners of war <br>
held by Azerbaijani and Karabagh forces break down after failing to <br>
reach an agreement on details of the exchange.  The head of the <br>
Nagorno Karabagh State Committee for War Prisoners and Hostages, <br>
Alexander Agasarian, accuses the Azerbaijani side of delaying the <br>
talks until the conclusion of the recent mediation talks brokered <br>
by the international mediators of the Organization for Security and <br>
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).<br>
<p>
17 November: The non-governmental organization Helsinki Initiative-<br>
92 announces its official endorsement for the candidacy of <br>
President Robert Kocharian in his bid for reelection.  Helsinki <br>
Initiative-92 coordinator Karen Ohanjanian cites Kocharian's <br>
contribution to state-building and the strengthening of democracy <br>
and the rule of law in Nagorno Karabagh.<br>
<p>
18 November: A new round of mediation talks are held in Helsinki <br>
under the auspices of the Finnish co-chair of the Organization for <br>
Security and Cooperation in Europe's (OSCE) working group on <br>
Karabagh.  The talks attempt to build on the initial progress made <br>
during the visit to Armenia and Azerbaijan by the Finnish foreign <br>
minister, Tarja Halonen.<br>
<p>
19 November: The Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF), the <br>
largest opposition party in Armenia and long active in the defense <br>
of Nagorno Karabagh, issues an endorsement of President Robert <br>
Kocharian calling on its members and supporters to vote for him in <br>
the upcoming presidential election.<br>
<p>
20 November: Nagorno Karabagh officials begin preparing their <br>
diplomatic and political position for the upcoming 54-nation summit <br>
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  <br>
Azerbaijan has announced that it will work toward a solution to the <br>
conflict through the OSCE mediation process but only from a <br>
position based on the international recognition of Azerbaijan's <br>
territorial integrity and sovereignty.  Baku seems determined to <br>
limit its concessions to greater autonomy for Nagorno Karabagh and <br>
resolutely dismisses Stepanakert's concerns for the security of its <br>
population and its defense of its right to self-determination. <br>
<p>
24 November: Nagorno Karabagh President Robert Kocharian is <br>
reelected to a five-year presidential term, garnering 86 percent of <br>
the vote while defeating two other candidates.  Parliamentarian <br>
Boris Aroushanian came in second with just under seven percent of <br>
the vote and Communist Party figure Hrant Melkoumian received 3.7 <br>
percent. The election enjoyed voter turnout of 78 percent of the <br>
electorate.  International election observers from the European <br>
Parliament, the Russian State Duma (the lower house of parliament) <br>
and other European countries report that the election was free and <br>
fair and was without any violations in election procedure.  <br>
President Kocharian was first elected to a two-year term in 1994 <br>
during Nagorno Karabagh's transition from a Soviet-style <br>
governmental structure to a presidential system.  The presidential <br>
election has been criticized by international organizations and <br>
countries attempting to mediate the Nagorno Karabagh conflict and <br>
has been sharply condemned by Azerbaijan.<br>
<p>
25 November: Armenian Minister of Justice Marat Alexanian meets <br>
with President Kocharian in Stepanakert.  The justice minister <br>
reviews a plan to provide Nagorno Karabagh with assistance in the <br>
development of the republic's legislation and criminal code.<br>
<p>
26 November: Speaking at a press conference in Stepanakert, <br>
Kocharian reports that the latest round of talks with Azerbaijan on <br>
the Karabagh conflict have ended in a stalemate.  The talks, <br>
serving as a preliminary round prior to next month's major summit <br>
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), <br>
comprised Armenian presidential advisor Jirair Libaridian and his <br>
Azerbaijani counterpart Vafa Guluzade.<br>

As the author of the monthly "Transcaucasus: A Chronollogy" publication, <br>
I thought you might be interested in a recent article I wrote examining <br>
the media in the Caucasus. The article was recently published by the NGO <br>
group ISAR, based here in Washington, in their publication, "Surviving <br>
Together." I hope it is of interest.<br>

OVERVIEW:  The State of the Media in the Transcaucasus<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Richard Giragosian                                          July 24, 1996<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
      An integral element in the transition to democracy currently underway<br>
among the<br>
countries of the former Soviet Union is the development of an independent, o<br>
bjective and fully<br>
functional media.  The media of these countries in transition provide an imp<br>
ortant role in the<br>
dynamic development of true democratic institutions.  The emerging media of<br>
the three countries<br>
of the Transcaucasus, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, provide an interestin<br>
g model for the<br>
other countries undergoing similar transitions.  Although there is a signifi<br>
cant legacy of full state<br>
control over the media within these countries, the media is now emerging as<br>
a vehicle for<br>
political accountability and a restraint on the power of the state.  The med<br>
ia is also adding a<br>
healthy dose of dissent to the political landscape.  True democracy is impos<br>
sible without free<br>
press and the development of an effective independent media is an essential<br>
counterpart to the<br>
development of the democratic institutions so necessary within these countri<br>
es in transition.<br>
<p>
*     The Armenian Media<br>
<p>
      The state of the media in Armenia remains constrained by the increasin<br>
g trend of<br>
authoritarian rule by the Armenian government.  The Armenian government has<br>
conducted a<br>
systematic campaign against the country's political opposition parties and h<br>
as unfairly shut down<br>
a number of leading independent and opposition media outlets.  Launched with<br>
 a December 1994<br>
presidential decree, twelve leading newspapers, magazines and media outlets<br>
were closed without<br>
benefit of trial or appeal.  Ten of these remain closed to this day, with th<br>
e authorities allowing<br>
for the reopening of the media outlets and publishing houses on a selective<br>
basis.  The Armenian<br>
government's campaign against the opposition press parallels its repression<br>
of the country's<br>
largest opposition party, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF).  The<br>
state's campaign<br>
also includes a series of state-orchestrated criminal cases aiming at margin<br>
alizing the ARF and<br>
of ensuring the continuation of government power in the hands of the ruling<br>
Armenian National<br>
Movement (ANM).  The state's campaign, however, deals a serious blow to the<br>
country's attempt<br>
to construct functional democratic institutions and further threatens to sow<br>
 discord and division<br>
within the Armenian society as a whole. The development of Armenian democrac<br>
y is also<br>
specifically hampered by this tightening of the freedoms of press and speech<br>
, as the state-<br>
affiliated organs and media are left to operate with no competition as littl<br>
e more than<br>
mouthpieces for the government.<br>
<p>
      The situation has worsened over the last year and a half with several<br>
cases of journalists<br>
being assaulted and beaten and the offices of several newspapers firebombed.<br>
  Most threatening<br>
is the lack of any real state investigation or prosecution of these crimes.<br>
 The government has<br>
also continued a Soviet-era tradition of forcing all newspapers --- oppositi<br>
on, state-run and<br>
independent --- to be dependent on government supplied newsprint and publica<br>
tion facilities.  The<br>
government also continues to control nearly all of the country's broadcastin<br>
g media.  The state<br>
control over the broadcasting medium also seriously hinders the ability of f<br>
air coverage of the<br>
political situation and during political campaigns and elections, prevents t<br>
he opposition parties<br>
from presenting their points of view to the Armenian electorate.  There are<br>
only a few small<br>
independent cable television companies, limited to broadcasting a small sele<br>
ction of movies, and<br>
only a sole independent radio station in operation.<br>
<p>
      Despite the government's crackdown targeting the opposition and their<br>
media, there are<br>
signs today of a few dynamic independent news organs providing fair coverage<br>
 of the country's<br>
daunting economic and political problems.  Coverage of the conflict in nearb<br>
y Nagorno<br>
Karabagh, where the Armenians of the Republic of Nagorno Karabagh have been<br>
waging a<br>
military defense of their republic in the face of Azerbaijan's attacks and l<br>
ong-standing economic<br>
and transport blockade, has tended to be balanced and has been notably devoi<br>
d of inflammatory<br>
ethnic nationalist propaganda.  Much to the credit of this new group of inde<br>
pendent journalists,<br>
coverage of the increasing level of corruption within the Armenian governmen<br>
t and the economic<br>
power of a small elite of well-connected Armenian National Movement (ANM) lo<br>
yalists<br>
demonstrate a new courage in the Armenian media.  This growing level of jour<br>
nalistic integrity<br>
holds promise that once the government's repression and intimidation lessens<br>
, the Armenian press<br>
can flourish and add a healthy element of constructive dissent when necessar<br>
y.  The realization<br>
of this promise, however, hinges on an end to the Armenian government's repr<br>
essive measures<br>
against the opposition and independent media.<br>
<p>
*     The Media in Georgia<br>
<p>
      Similar to the situation facing the media in the Russian Federation, t<br>
he Georgian press<br>
is severely daunted by the strong influence of organized crime and a lack of<br>
 law and order.  The<br>
Georgian media is also beset by the problems of paramilitary militia groups<br>
and ethnic conflicts<br>
within the country, adding a significant element of personal danger for the<br>
average Georgian<br>
journalist not faced by other journalists.  The outlook for press freedoms i<br>
n the country has<br>
greatly improved over the past year, with more than twenty different opposit<br>
ion newspapers<br>
enjoying fairly wide circulation and operating without significant governmen<br>
t interference<br>
throughout the country.  The state still maintains control, however, over ma<br>
ny newspapers and<br>
most television stations, as well as the country's major publishing house.<br>
The government's two<br>
main organs, the newspapers "Sarkartvelos Respublic" and Svobodnya Gruzya,"<br>
consistently fail<br>
to publish any opposition viewpoints, however.<br>
<p>
      Although opposition groups charge that the Georgian government hinders<br>
 their circulation<br>
by failing to provide sufficient supplies of newsprint and other resources,<br>
and that they are denied<br>
equal access to government-run national television stations, there is eviden<br>
ce of recent advances<br>
in this regard.  Specifically, the government has allowed for all political<br>
parties to be given equal,<br>
rotating time on state television during the elections of last November and<br>
has introduced new<br>
television shows geared toward providing coverage of opposition viewpoints.<br>
 The one notable<br>
case of harassment involved an attempt by some government officials to censo<br>
r a private<br>
television station.  The incident occurred in June 1995 with the recision of<br>
 the license of a local<br>
television station by communications ministry officials.  The station, "Rust<br>
avi TV," had refused<br>
to submit to censorship by municipal authorities.  After several protests by<br>
 the media, the<br>
ministry granted the station its license the next month.<br>
<p>
*     The Media of Azerbaijan<br>
<p>
      Azerbaijan remains the worst offender of freedoms of the press in the<br>
region.  With the<br>
country's recent pattern of armed changes in government, attempted forcible<br>
seizures of power<br>
and military conflict over the Armenian-populated Republic of Nagorno Karaba<br>
gh, the<br>
Azerbaijani media has been victim to strict campaigns of military censorship<br>
, martial law and a<br>
pattern of institutionalized state repression.  State censorship is formally<br>
 implemented on the<br>
grounds of national security with the state routinely subjecting all media o<br>
utlets to prepublication<br>
inspection, random searches and seizures, and the warrantless arrest of jour<br>
nalists for a wide<br>
ranges of charges.  Although there are examples of articles appearing in the<br>
 press expressing<br>
opinions critical of the government and the administration, there have been<br>
notable cases of<br>
journalists being convicted for publishing articles expressing "personal cri<br>
ticism of the office of<br>
the president."  This atmosphere of military censorship and martial law has<br>
encouraged the<br>
Azerbaijani media to exercise virtual self-censorship.<br>
 <br>
      Although there are several hundred different opposition, independent a<br>
nd state-affiliated<br>
newspapers available in the country, the government exercises strong control<br>
 over their<br>
circulation.  The state-run publication and distribution monopoly has increa<br>
sed the price of<br>
newsprint to over forty percent above the world market price to effectively<br>
force the closure and<br>
financial hardship of many of these independent and opposition organs.  The<br>
Azerbaijani<br>
government also controls nearly all of the country's national radio and tele<br>

MONTHLY CHRONOLOGY<br>
<p>
1 October: A group of wives and mothers of arrested opposition <br>
leaders and deputies issue an appeal to international organizations <br>
and the media calling for an independent review of last month's <br>
presidential election, the restoration of civil liberties, and the <br>
release of all those arrested in the government crackdown on the <br>
opposition following the elections.  Western diplomats estimate <br>
that at least 250 opposition leaders and supporters have been <br>
arrested since September 25th.  The U.S. Department of State issues <br>
a statement expressing concern over the arrests and urges all <br>
parties to adhere to the democratic rule of law.  The tense <br>
political situation stems from the official declaration that Levon <br>
Ter Petrosian won reelection with 51.6 percent of the vote in the <br>
first round amid widespread allegations of fraud and voting <br>
irregularities.  The Armenian Communist Party withdraws its 8 <br>
deputies from parliament in protest over the government's actions, <br>
effectively leaving the parliament without an opposition.<br>
<p>
1 October: In a Russian television interview, opposition <br>
presidential candidate Vazgen Manukian announces that he favors a <br>
peaceful political solution to the current political crisis in <br>
Armenia.  Manukian, currently in hiding to evade arrest, accuses <br>
the Ter Petrosian government of rigging the election's results and <br>
asserts that actual vote tabulations show Manukian with over 50 <br>
percent.  The chairman of the state Central Election Commission <br>
Khachatour Bezirjian refutes charges of voting irregularities and <br>
accuses the opposition of manipulating the situation.  The <br>
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), <br>
however, reports that there are 22,000 ballots missing, which <br>
roughly equals the number of votes Ter Petrosian claimed to avoid a <br>
run-off.<br>
<p>
4 October: Opposition parliamentarian Aramazd Zakarian of the <br>
National Self-Determination Union files a lawsuit in the U.S. <br>
Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York <br>
against Armenian presidential advisor and U.S. citizen Jirair <br>
Libaridian for his part in the government's campaign of arrest and <br>
prosecution of the opposition.   The suit charges Libaridian with <br>
complicity in the physical assault against Zakarian under the Alien <br>
Tort Claims Act, a statute allowing for judicial redress for <br>
victims of international human rights abuses.<br>
<p>
8 October: At a press conference in Washington, the International <br>
Foundation for Election Systems (IFES) releases its report <br>
regarding the Armenian presidential election.  The report terms the <br>
election as "flawed" and calls for "further investigations and <br>
international scrutiny" of the results.  IFES cites some <br>
advancements in the electoral process, greater transparency and <br>
increases in voter education.  However, the report adds that "the <br>
election process broke down as the vote count started, with <br>
multiple reports of proxies being threatened, documents being <br>
falsified, and in one case witnessed by the political officer of <br>
the U.S. Embassy, the ballots of an entire precinct being stolen."  <br>
According to the official statement of the state Central Election <br>
Commission, Ter Petrosian received over 50% of the vote, thus <br>
avoiding a run-off election round, by some 21,941 votes.  The IFES <br>
report stresses that 22,013 ballots were missing.  The IFES report <br>
follows critical statements from Amnesty International, Human <br>
Rights Watch, the Moscow-based Memorial Human Rights Center and a <br>
group of Russian parliamentarians.<br>
<p>
10 October: President Ter Petrosian announces the lifting of his <br>
earlier decree banning all public gatherings, rallies and <br>
demonstrations and suspending other civil liberties.  The decree <br>
was issued on September 26th in response to the disruption and <br>
shootings at a mass opposition rally at the parliament.<br>
<p>
11 October: An official of the Armenian Scientific-Industrial Civil <br>
Union (SICU), Rafael Ghazarian, holds a press conference at the <br>
Russian State Duma to report on the recent Armenian presidential <br>
election.  According to Ghazarian, the election was seriously <br>
marred by the government's campaign of fraud and voting <br>
irregularities, and that incumbent President Levon Ter Petrosian <br>
had really garnered a mere 30 percent of the vote while the <br>
opposition candidate Vazgen Manukian actually had 60 percent.  The <br>
beatings and physical assaults of opposition deputies and activists <br>
by the state security forces is also raised during the press <br>
conference.<br>
<p>
11 October: According to statistics released by the International <br>
Monetary Fund (IMF), Armenia's recent economic recovery is slowing.  <br>
Growth in the country's gross domestic product (GDP) slowed during <br>
the first half of the year, while the trade deficit grew due to <br>
declining exports.  There is improvement in inflation, however, <br>
with the level of consumer prices rising by only three percent from <br>
January to August.  Wages in the country are rising in real dollar <br>
terms, but they remain low when compared to other newly independent <br>
countries.  The IMF cites unemployment as steadily holding at 9 <br>
percent, but notes that the true unemployment figure is at least <br>
double the official rate.<br>
<p>
11 October: As the government withdraws the last security forces <br>
and armored vehicles from their positions within the capital, <br>
former National Security Minister David Shahnazarian calls on the <br>
Ter Petrosian government to dismiss the prime minister and the <br>
ministers of interior and defense for their part in the <br>
confrontation with demonstrators following last month's <br>
presidential election.  The political situation remains tense, <br>
however, as there are several indictments of opposition leaders <br>
pending and the opposition parties and the press are still not <br>
allowed to operate freely.  With local and municipal elections <br>
scheduled for November 11th, many expect renewed confrontation <br>
between the opposition and the Ter Petrosian government.<br>
 <br>
11-12 October: A three-member delegation of officials from the <br>
Council of Europe arrive in Yerevan on a  three day fact-finding <br>
mission to investigate the political situation in the country <br>
following the marred presidential elections.  The delegation meets <br>
with various government officials and also conducts interviews with <br>
opposition presidential candidates Sergei Badalian and Vazgen <br>
Manukian and imprisoned opposition deputies and leaders Rouben <br>
Hakobian, David Vardanian, Kim Balayan and the recently released <br>
Shavarsh Kocharian.  The European delegation states that they <br>
believe that the arrest of the deputies is a retreat from democracy <br>
and expresses its grave concern with reports of beatings and <br>
violations of rights of the detainees by the Armenian authorities.  <br>
A Council of Europe official participating in the delegation, <br>
Hanneka Gelderblom, categorizes the election as being undemocratic.  <br>
The delegation's final report is to be released sometime next <br>
month.  Another delegation from the European Union was to have held <br>
meetings with Armenian officials concerning trade issues but <br>
canceled the visit following the election turmoil.<br>
<p>
12-13 October: The last of the imprisoned opposition <br>
parliamentarians, Rouben Hakobian of the Armenian Revolutionary <br>
Federation (ARF) and David Vardanian of the National Democratic <br>
Union (NDU), are freed from detention but their travel is <br>
restricted to Yerevan and they are still being charged with various <br>
crimes.  The tense political situation is further exacerbated by <br>
the announcement that the Armenian Constitutional Court is <br>
rejecting the appeal of the election lodged by Manukian on the <br>
grounds that his appeal was written incorrectly.  ARF member and <br>
former parliamentarian, Kim Balayan, remains imprisoned and without <br>
access to council.<br>
<p>
14 October: A three-day international conference, sponsored by the <br>
World Bank, the French Embassy, and the United Nations Development <br>
Program (UNDP), convenes in Yerevan to discuss the ecological <br>
situation of Lake Sevan.  The conference examines the declining <br>
water table and the worsening ecological conditions of the lake, <br>
with a recovery period expected to last as much as 20-30 years to <br>
restore Lake Sevan to its natural water level.<br>
<p>
18 October: Municipal authorities of the capital Yerevan reverses <br>
its earlier ruling and withdraws its permission for an opposition <br>
rally citing errors in the application.  The opposition announces <br>
that it will resubmit its application and will stage a rally the <br>
next week.  The opposition's move follows the recent lifting of the <br>
government's ban on all public gatherings and rallies.<br>
<p>
23 October: By order of governmental decree, Prime Minister Hrant <br>
Bagratian announces the dismissals of the deputy Mayor of Yerevan, <br>
Gevork Arzoumanian, first deputy Minister for Education Ashot <br>
Bleyan, and the Civil Aviation Departmental Chief, Shahen <br>
Petrossian.  The dismissals are reported to be part of the <br>
government's attempted crackdown on corruption.<br>
<p>
25 October: Over 100,000 demonstrators converge on central Yerevan <br>
in an opposition rally in support of the five-party opposition <br>
coalition's petition to the Constitutional Court demanding new <br>
presidential elections.  The pro-government Constitutional Court, <br>
consisting of presidential appointees, has already rejected one <br>
such petition by the opposition on questionable grounds and is <br>
widely expected to refuse this new petition.  Additional opposition <br>
rallies are planned for the beginning of November.  The five <br>
opposition parties also announce their boycott of local and <br>
municipal elections slated for November 11th.<br>

MONTHLY CHRONOLOGY<br>
<p>
8 October: Deputy chairman of the International Affairs Committee <br>
of the Russian State Duma Aleksey Podberezkin meets with President <br>
Eduard Shevardnadze to discuss the Abkhazian conflict and to review <br>
developments in bilateral relations between Georgia and Russia.  <br>
The meeting is the latest in the new strategic partnership between <br>
the two countries and is an attempt to renew the deadlocked <br>
negotiations over the Abkhazian conflict and to soften <br>
disagreements on the issue of Russian military basing rights in <br>
Georgia.<br>
<p>
8 October: A Tbilisi district court sentences former Defense <br>
Minister Tengiz Kitovani and two of his associates on charges <br>
related to his military attempt at forcibly seizing control over <br>
Abkhazia in January 1995. Following an eleven month investigation <br>
and a nine month trial, Kitovani is sentenced to serve an eight <br>
year prison term.  Kitovani's two associates, former deputy Prime <br>
Minister Irakli Surguladze and Valerii Fisyun, receive sentences of <br>
21 months and six years respectfully.  Surguladze is freed because <br>
of time served since his January 1995 arrest.<br>
<p>
10 October: The United Nations Special Envoy for the Abkhazian <br>
conflict, Eduard Brunner, meets with Abkhazian President Vladislav <br>
Ardzinba in Sukhumi.  The talks represent a renewed mediation <br>
attempt by the United Nations and focus on reaching a political <br>
settlement to the Abkhazian conflict.  The United Nations envoy <br>
also urges a new attempt at honoring the earlier agreement <br>
providing for the safe return of the several hundred thousand <br>
Georgian refugees displaced from their homes in Abkhazia.  The <br>
situation has worsened lately due to the decision by the Abkhazian <br>
parliament to hold elections on November 23rd.  The Georgian <br>
government has strongly renounced the decision and has stated that <br>
the move threatens further negotiations.<br>
<p>
10 October: The Russian Foreign Ministry condemns the October 2 <br>
resolution of the Georgian parliament calling for the revision of <br>
Georgian-Russian relations.  The Russians see the resolution as <br>
questioning their role in the Abkhazian conflict, and putting into <br>
doubt their role as primary military peace-keeper in the region.  <br>
The Georgian decision also calls for a renegotiation of the current <br>
military basing agreement between Moscow and Tbilisi.  <br>
<p>
10 October: The president of the Chevron oil company, Richard <br>
Matzke, meets with Shevardnadze and Ajarian parliamentarian <br>
chairman Aslan Abashidze to discuss the use of the Batumi port <br>
facilities on the Black Sea for the transport of oil from <br>
Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.  The issue of transporting the oil from <br>
the massive energy deals in Azerbaijan and Central Asia is key to <br>
the projects' long-term viability.<br>
<p>
11 October: A representative of the United Nations High Commission <br>
for Refugees (UNHCR) announces that an opening ceremony for the <br>
reconstructed bridge spanning the southern Georgian Banoshou river <br>
will be held on November fifth.  The restoration of the railway and <br>
transport links between Georgia and Armenia is crucial to the <br>
Armenian economy and will restore normal levels of trade with <br>
Russia.  These transport routes have been sabotaged by sporadic <br>
bombings for several years in the Azeri-populated Marneuli <br>
district.<br>
<p>
11 October: Abkhazian parliamentary chairman Vladislav Ardzinba <br>
announces his rejection of the Georgian proposal for negotiations <br>
on the status of Abkhazia.  Ardzinba also welcomes the statement of <br>
the UN Special Envoy to Abkhazia, Eduard Brunner, endorsing <br>
Abkhazia's plan to hold parliamentary elections on November 23rd.<br>
<p>
14 October: The European Union (EU) announces that it is awarding a <br>
$4 million aid package for the three Caucasus states.  Most of the <br>
EU assistance is to go toward relief projects in Georgia to be <br>
coordinated through the offices of the Red Cross, Oxfam, Caritas <br>
and Medicins Sans Frontiers.  Georgia is slated to receive some <br>
$2.5 million in clothing, medicine and other humanitarian supplies, <br>
with Armenia being allocated slightly more than $1 million and <br>
$250,000 in aid for Azerbaijan.<br>
<p>
22 October: The United Nations Security Council adopts a resolution <br>
calling on Abkhazia to cancel its parliamentary elections scheduled <br>
for next month.  The UN move seeks to restore an atmosphere <br>
conducive for further negotiations between Georgian and Abkhazian <br>
representatives and see the election as a complication since its <br>
precedes any firm negotiations for a political solution to the <br>
Abkhazian conflict. <br>

<p>
MONTHLY CHRONOLOGY<br>
<p>
1 October: A news conference is convened in a Baku mosque by the <br>
Committee for the Rights of Arrested Islamic Activists to demand <br>
the release of nine Party of Islam activists detained by <br>
Azerbaijani security officials since last spring.  The Islamic <br>
activists are reportedly in ill health and suffering from poor <br>
prison conditions.  Azerbaijani security officials have charged the <br>
Islamic detainees with committing anti-state actions, espionage and <br>
other activities in support of the Iranian regime.  The Islamic <br>
group is not formally recognized by the Aliyev government and their <br>
detention remains a problem in the development of Iranian-<br>
Azerbaijani relations.<br>
<p>
4 October: The recently convened Azerbaijani parliament formally <br>
ratifies an agreement with a consortium of international oil <br>
companies to explore and develop the Shah-Deniz oil and natural gas <br>
deposits along the Caspian Sea continental shelf.  This $4 billion <br>
project, second in scope only to the $7.5 billion consortium deal <br>
involving the Chirag-Azeri-Guneshli fields, calls for the <br>
development of an estimated 400-500 billion cubic meters of natural <br>
gas, 200 million metric tons of gas condensate and 100-190 million <br>
metric tons of oil at a depth of 60 to 550 meters.  The development <br>
phase of the deal is planned to last thirty-five years, with <br>
initial production ready by the year 2002.  The Shah-Deniz field is <br>
one of twenty-four currently being surveyed and readied for <br>
negotiation and would enable Azerbaijan to meet its domestic <br>
natural gas requirements with enough of a surplus to make the <br>
country into a fairly significant exporter.  The consortium <br>
comprises 25.5 percent shares for British Petroleum and Norway's <br>
Statoil, the French Elf Aquitaine firm, Russia's Lukoil, the <br>
Iranian Sate Oil Company and Azerbaijan's SOCAR state oil company <br>
with a 10 percent share each, and the Turkish State Oil Company <br>
with a nine percent stake.  The U.S. has pressured U.S. oil <br>
companies to withdraw from the project following the inclusion of <br>
the Iranians.<br>
<p>
5 October: Russian government officials announce the reopening of <br>
cross-border rail transit along the Russian-Azerbaijani borders.  <br>
The railway line and most major transport links and roads through <br>
the Daghestan region, which is situated on either side of the <br>
Russian-Azerbaijani border, have been closed since December 1994, <br>
resulting in a sharp decline in trade and commerce.<br>
<p>
9 October: The president of the Azerbaijani International Operating <br>
Company, Terry Adams, meets with Azerbaijani President Geidar <br>
Aliyev to discuss the latest developments in the multi-billion <br>
dollar oil exploration project.  Specifically, the meeting focuses <br>
on the continued problem of securing a definitive and adequate <br>
route through which to export the oil.  A pipeline from Baku to the <br>
Georgian port of Supsa along the Black Sea, is not expected to <br>
become fully operational until late 1998.  Also, another pipeline <br>
route to the Russian port of Novorossiisk is tentatively planned to <br>
be operational by August 1997 for the transport of oil from the <br>
Chirag field.  <br>
<p>
9 October: Representatives of a committee organizing an <br>
international conference on the status and treatment of the Lezgin <br>
people of northern Azerbaijan, issue a call for immediate dialogue <br>
with the Russian and Azerbaijani governments to prevent "acts of <br>
violence."  The Lezgin population is divided among Azerbaijan and <br>
the Russian Federation's Daghestan region.  The call also demands <br>
an easing of travel restrictions imposed on the Lezgins in the <br>
border area and appeals for an end to the Azerbaijani government's <br>
policy of discrimination against the Lezgin minority.  The Congress <br>
of Lezgin People is scheduled to be held in Moscow in January 1997.  <br>
 <br>
11 October: British Prime Minister John Major appeals to Azerbaijan <br>
to form a new international consortium to develop offshore oil <br>
fields in the Caspian Sea.  According to the chairman of the <br>
Azerbaijani state oil company SOCAR, Natik Aliyev, the British <br>
proposal includes the U.S. company Mobil, France's Total Oil and <br>
the British Ramco Energy firm.  A similar proposal for a new <br>
consortium has also been submitted to Baku by French Foreign <br>
Minister Herve de Charette.  The French plan calls for the <br>
formation of a new consortium to explore and develop the offshore <br>
Lenkorandeniz and Astaradeniz reserves.  The French state oil <br>
company Elf Aquitaine, which is awaiting approval from Aliyev to <br>
develop two other oil fields, is bidding for a 75 percent share in <br>
this proposal<br>
<p>
11 October: According to the new agreement between the Azerbaijani <br>
state oil company SOCAR and Chevron's division dealing with oil <br>
projects in Kazakhstan, Tengizchevroil, an initial shipment of oil <br>
from the Kazakh Tengiz field arrives at Baku's Dyubendi port <br>
facility along the Caspian Sea.  The agreement calls for the <br>
shipment of some 20,000 metric tons of oil from Kazakhstan across <br>
the Caspian to Baku port facilities from where SOCAR will transport <br>
the oil by rail to the Georgian port of Batumi. <br>
<p>
15 October: Following an earlier proposal by the British <br>
government, Azerbaijani officials announce the formation of a new <br>
consortium of Western oil companies and the Azerbaijani state oil <br>
company to explore and develop additional offshore oil reserves in <br>
the southern Caspian Sea.  The new consortium includes the British <br>
firm Ramco, Mobil and Total in an unspecified sharing agreement.<br>
<p>
15 October: The Azerbaijani parliament elects Murtuz Aleskerov as <br>
its chairman, replacing the ousted Rasul Guliev.  Guliev was forced <br>
from the post following his call for a speeding up of economic <br>
reform and privatization, a position which clashed with other <br>
Aliyev advisors.  The new parliamentary chairman, a position second <br>
only to President Aliyev, was a prominent member of the Azerbaijani <br>
Popular Front, the banned party of former President Abulfez <br>
Elchibey.  Aleskerov left the Popular Front in 1992 and began <br>
assisting the efforts of current President Geidar Aliyev to come to <br>
power from his base in Nakhichevan.  The new chairman is also one <br>
of the founders and deputy chairman of the pro-Aliyev Yenni (New) <br>
Azerbaijani party.<br>
<p>
16 October: President Aliyev welcomes the participants of a two-day <br>
conference on refugees and displaced people organized by the <br>
Azerbaijani State Commission for Technical and Humanitarian Aid.  <br>
The conference consists of delegates from various Islamic <br>
countries, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Turkey.  <br>
<p>
19 October: Top officials of the Russian state oil company Lukoil <br>
meet with Azerbaijani officials to review plans to develop the <br>
offshore Inam oil reserve in the Caspian Sea.  Lukoil is seeking a <br>
fifty percent share in the project which is estimated to hold 120-<br>
150 million metric tons of oil.  President Aliyev is also said to <br>
be discussing additional cooperative ventures with LUKoil including <br>
the formation of a joint insurance company and a Russian-<br>
Azerbaijani project to modernize floating oil rigs in the Caspian. <br>
<p>
22 October: Azerbaijani government officials reach an agreement <br>
with visiting delegations from the World Bank and United Nations <br>
Development Program (UNDP) providing for financial assistance for <br>
the reconstruction of the country's infrastructure.  The estimated <br>
cost of reconstruction stands at a daunting $22 billion. The World <br>
Bank has pledged some $50 million in aid and other donor nations <br>
have committed to $7.6 million in assistance to be directed toward <br>
projects underway by the United Nations High Commission for <br>
Refugees (UNHCR). <br>
<p>
25 October: During the course of a summit in Moscow of the Black <br>
Sea Economic Cooperation group, Azerbaijani President Aliyev meets <br>
with his Armenian and Turkish counterparts, Presidents Ter <br>
Petrosian and Suleyman Demirel.  The three heads of state discuss <br>
several regional issues, including the developing bilateral <br>
relations between Iran and Armenia and the issue of the closure of <br>
the Armenian-Turkish border.  Under Azerbaijani pressure, the <br>
Turkish president promises to maintain the border's closure until <br>
the full return of all Azerbaijani territory held by Nagorno <br>
Karabagh forces. An additional private meeting is held between the <br>
Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents, with no details on their <br>
discussions available. <br>
<p>
26 October: The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's working <br>
group on the Caspian Sea, Ambassador Feliks Kovalev, announces that <br>
Russia has accepted the delineation of the national sovereign <br>
sectors and economic zones in a forty mile offshore area of the <br>
Caspian Sea.  The Russian position advocates the creation of a <br>
common littoral zone to be shared by all countries bordering the <br>
Sea beyond the forty mile area.  Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Hasan <br>
Hasanov welcomes the new Russian position, which reverses Moscow's <br>
prior refusal to allow any sector division, but notes that the <br>
Russian proposal for a common jurisdictional zone beyond the forty <br>
mile area would significantly complicate the international oil <br>
deals that Azerbaijan is pursuing.  The Kazakhstan government <br>
reacts by supporting Baku's stance, in line with the recent <br>
bilateral agreement between the two countries establishing a <br>
regulatory framework of military navigation in the Caspian.  This <br>
agreement conspicuously excludes mention of both Iran and Russia <br>
and, therefore, challenges the concept of shared rights and <br>
obligations of all littoral states.<br>

MONTHLY CHRONOLOGY<br>
<p>
3 October: Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliyev criticizes the <br>
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and its <br>
special working group on the Karabagh conflict, the Minsk Group, <br>
for failing to accomplish anything beyond declarations since its <br>
1994 OSCE Budapest summit.  The Azerbaijani president, during <br>
meetings with OSCE representatives, specifically condemns the OSCE <br>
for its "failure to explain to Armenia that the Armenian community <br>
of Karabagh will not receive the status of an independent state."  <br>
<p>
4 October: Following the heated meetings with the Azerbaijani <br>
president in Baku, the delegation of Organization for Security and <br>
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) officials arrive in Stepanakert to <br>
meet with Nagorno Karabagh government representatives.  The talks <br>
focus on a rapid political settlement prior to the OSCE's summit to <br>
be held in Lisbon in December.  The co-chairmen of the OSCE's Minsk <br>
Group, Heikki Talvitie and Valentin Lozinski, also express <br>
displeasure with the plan to hold presidential elections in <br>
Karabagh and state that the election only provokes a harsh <br>
Azerbaijani reaction which seriously impedes their organization's <br>
mediation effort. <br>
<p>
8 October: Iranian deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vayezi announces <br>
that his country will be launching a new diplomatic initiative <br>
seeking to mediate the Nagorno Karabagh conflict.  The Iranian <br>
official makes the announcement following a meeting in Moscow with <br>
Russian deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastoukhov.<br>
<p>
15 October: The Nagorno Karabagh government prepares for the <br>
upcoming presidential election slated for November 24th.  According <br>
to the recently passed legal framework on elections, the new <br>
president will serve a term of five years and will formally replace <br>
the temporary term of current President Robert Kocharian.  <br>
Candidates are required to have lived in Nagorno Karabagh for the <br>
last ten years and must collect 1500 signed petitions supporting <br>
their candidacy by October 25th.  Official candidates will be <br>
registered from October 30th to November 4th, with the formal <br>
election campaign starting on November 5th and lasting until <br>
November 23rd.  A new electoral district is to be formed for the <br>
Nagorno Karabagh citizens currently residing in Armenia. Candidates <br>
for the presidential election proposed to date include current <br>
President Robert Kocharian, parliamentarian and former deputy <br>
parliamentary speaker Boris Arushanian, and the leader of the <br>
organizational committee of the Nagorno Karabagh Communist Party, <br>
Hrant Melkoumian. <br>
<p>
22 October: With presidential elections only a little more than a <br>
month away, Nagorno Karabagh officials reveal that a new candidate <br>
has been formally registered for the race.  The new candidate is <br>
state administrator Albert Gazarian, bringing the total field to <br>
four candidates.  For the remainder of the month, the Karabagh <br>
Central Electoral Commission will verify the candidates' petitions <br>
and complete the registration process before launching the full <br>
campaign.<br>
<p>
23 October: The coordinator of the "Helsinki Initiative-92" <br>
Committee on Nagorno Karabagh, Karen Ohanjanian, announces that he <br>
can no longer to continue to cooperate with his Azerbaijani <br>
counterpart, Arzu Abdullayeva, the coordinator of the Azerbaijani <br>
Helsinki Citizen Assembly.  The Karabagh civic activist criticizes <br>
the Azerbaijani side for their position advocating military <br>
attempts to settle the Nagorno Karabagh conflict, stressing that <br>
such a position contradicts the peaceful aims of the citizen groups <br>
seeking a dialogue between all sides to the conflict. The Nagorno <br>
Karabagh civic group also announces a new international conference <br>
of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to examine "preventive <br>
diplomacy in conflict settlement" to be held in Stepanakert from <br>
November 1-4.  Participation in the conference includes NGO <br>
delegations and representatives from the United States, <br>
Switzerland, Great Britain, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Russia, <br>
Ukraine, Armenia and Georgia. <br>
<p>
24 October: The Azerbaijani government issues a statement <br>
condemning the scheduled presidential elections in Nagorno Karabagh <br>
as "illegal and invalid,"  The statement continues that any <br>
elections for legitimate bodies of power in the region can only <br>
occur after the return of all Azerbaijani refugees, the return of <br>
Azerbaijani territory currently held by Karabagh forces, and the <br>
restoration of the Soviet-era ethnic composition of the republic.<br>
<p>
26 October: The Russian Foreign Ministry issues a statement <br>
regarding the presidential elections in Nagorno Karabagh slated for <br>
late next month.  The Russian statement criticizes the election for <br>
running counter to the mediation effort underway seeking a <br>
political solution to the Karabagh conflict. <br>
<p>
28 October: Nagorno Karabagh President Robert Kocharian announces <br>
that presidential elections will proceed as scheduled despite <br>
criticism from Russian and Azerbaijani government spokesmen.  The <br>
elections are also the subject of a statement by the U.S. <br>
Department of State, which expressed concern over the election as <br>
possibly "complicating the outcome of the Organization for Security <br>
and Cooperation in Europe's Minsk Group peace process." <br>
<p>
28 October: A new round of OSCE mediation talks on the Karabagh <br>
conflict convenes in Moscow.  Expected to last three days, the <br>
talks focus on the issues related to the demilitarization of the <br>
Armenian-Azerbaijani border area.  This round of talks is somewhat <br>
hindered by the strong Azerbaijani opposition to the scheduled <br>
presidential elections in Nagorno Karabagh, stating that the <br>
November 24th election is illegal as it precedes the holding of <br>
negotiations over the political status of Nagorno Karabagh.<br>
<p>
29 October: In an Armenian television interview, President <br>
Kocharian reacts to the criticism of the Nagorno Karabagh <br>
presidential election by the Organization for Security and <br>
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) by restating his government's firm <br>
stand on the Karabagh conflict "from which there can be no retreat <br>
and no fallback positions."  Kocharian states that Nagorno Karabagh <br>
will "never" be part of Azerbaijan or become subordinate to Baku.  <br>
The response follows a critical OSCE interpretation of the election <br>
as hampering the mediation efforts underway.  The election is <br>
scheduled for November 24th and President Kocharian is expected to <br>
win a second term easily.<br>
<p>
29 October: President Kocharian meets with Sergei Badalian, the <br>
First Secretary of the Armenian Communist Party, during a visit to <br>
Yerevan.  The meeting centers on the current OSCE peace initiative <br>
and reviews the upcoming election in Nagorno Karabagh.  President <br>
Kocharian also meets with his election rival, Karabagh Communist <br>
Party figure Hrant Melkoumian.<br>

MONTHLY CHRONOLOGY<br>
<p>
2 September: Following a meeting with Armenian defense ministry<br>
officials, Bulgarian Defense Minister Dimitri Pavlov signs a<br>
bilateral agreement on military cooperation between Armenia and<br>
Bulgaria.  The bilateral agreement calls for the exchange of<br>
military equipment and hardware, the joint training of military<br>
personnel and cooperative ventures in military-related<br>
technological research and production.<br>
<p>
2 September: Armenian President Levon Ter Petrosian releases his<br>
election platform for the upcoming presidential election.  The<br>
platform's priorities include the development and strengthening of<br>
democratic institutions, continued elimination of corruption and<br>
crime, the strengthening of the army and intelligence agencies, and<br>
the acceleration of economic reforms with supplemental increases in<br>
wages and the creation of a national social security system.  The<br>
platform also calls for increasing cooperation with Russia, Georgia<br>
and Iran, as well as establishing more stable relations with<br>
Azerbaijan and Turkey.  Ter Petrosian promises to find a compromise<br>
solution to the Nagorno Karabagh conflict and to improve relations<br>
with the substantial Armenia diaspora throughout the world.  <br>
<p>
2 September: The head of Armenian State Radio, Stepan Zakarian, is<br>
dismissed from his post following a controversial court case<br>
involving Mikael Martirossian, the head of a state-owned bread<br>
factory and member of the ANM.  Several reports carried by Armenian<br>
radio accused bread producers of selling low-weight bread in order<br>
to increase profits. These reports led to court challenges and<br>
forced the radio station to issue a retraction.<br>
<p>
4-5 September: A group of prominent intellectuals publishes a call<br>
for the government to end the ban of the opposition Armenian<br>
Revolutionary Federation (ARF).  The statement criticizes the Ter<br>
Petrosian government for its illegal suspension of the ARF and for<br>
its state campaign targeting the opposition within the country.  A<br>
similar plea is also issued the next day by a coalition of fourteen<br>
different political and public organizations and parties. The<br>
statement also condemns the government's disregard for the civil<br>
liberties of free speech and the right to voice political dissent. <br>
Both statements appear to coincide with an effort by the ARF to<br>
gather at least 200,000 signatures of Armenian citizens urging the<br>
legal reinstatement of the ARF in the country.<br>
<p>
5 September: The opposition Scientific Industrial and Civil Union<br>
(SICU) and the National Democratic Union (NDU) hold a joint rally<br>
with more than 20,000 participants supporting the opposition in the<br>
upcoming presidential election.  The opposition parties' leaders<br>
urge their supporters to vote against the corrupt Ter Petrosian<br>
government and specifically condemns the government's persecution<br>
of the opposition Armenian Revolutionary Federation .<br>
<p>
6 September: The head of election observers for the Organization<br>
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Simon Osborn, states<br>
that his team is preparing for the comprehensive task of monitoring<br>
the September 22nd presidential election.  The OSCE observers are<br>
planning to visit various polling stations throughout the country. <br>
The OSCE is said to be maintaining vigilance given the "free but<br>
not fair" nature of the parliamentary elections.<br>
<p>
7-8 September: Opposition candidates Pariur Hairikian of the<br>
National Self-Determination Union, Aram Sargsian of the Democratic<br>
Party and Lenser Aghalovian of the Artsakh-Hayastan movement<br>
announce their withdrawal from the Armenian presidential race and<br>
support for Vazgen Manoukian (NDU).  The two other major opposition<br>
candidates, Sergei Badalian of the Armenian Communist Party and<br>
Ashot Manoucharian of the Scientific-Industrial and Civil Union<br>
(SICU), remain in the presidential race.  The country's largest<br>
opposition party, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF),<br>
still banned by the government, is also supporting Manoukian.<br>
<p>
8 September: The presidential candidate Vazgen Manoukian, releases<br>
a new common campaign platform of the three newly united opposition<br>
parties.  The united plan calls for full independence for the<br>
Republic of Nagorno Karabagh, state policies "based on Armenian<br>
national values," formation of a new government of national accord<br>
by the allied opposition parties, new parliamentary elections, and<br>
the adoption of a new constitution strengthening the legislative<br>
and judicial branches of government to better balance power against<br>
the strong executive branch.  Additional proposals include<br>
industrial policies to promote indigenous industry in order to<br>
foster greater self-sufficiency, a broad campaign aimed at<br>
eliminating corruption and organized crime, and a new focus on<br>
social programs to ease the effects of economic reform and<br>
privatization.<br>
<p>
10 September: Iranian deputy Foreign Minister Mahmud Vaezi meets<br>
with Armenian officials to review bilateral plans for increasing<br>
trade, commerce and economic cooperation.  Specifically, the<br>
proposals include the construction of a cross-border natural gas<br>
pipeline and a high voltage electricity line, further Iranian<br>
investment in Armenia's infrastructure with a focus on modernizing<br>
and expanding Armenia's railway and highway network, and a<br>
trilateral agreement providing for the shipment of natural gas from<br>
Turkmenistan, through Iran and to Armenia.<br>
<p>
18 September: In the largest military exercise in the region since<br>
1991, four thousand Russian and Armenian troops stage joint<br>
military exercises using armored vehicles, tanks, artillery and<br>
military aircraft.<br>
<p>
22 September: Incumbent President Ter Petrosian claims victory in<br>
the day's presidential elections as early unofficial returns<br>
released by the Armenian Central Election Commission show a 56 to<br>
37 percent margin for the president over his opposition rival<br>
Vazgen Manoukian of the National Democratic Union.  An estimated<br>
2.4 million Armenian voters participated in the election.  The<br>
opposition stages a rally to protest the election, accusing the<br>
authorities of massive fraud in the counting of the ballots.<br>
<p>
23 September: The independent and non-political European Institute<br>
for the Media, which actively monitored the presidential campaign,<br>
criticizes the election and reports that state-run television and<br>
media "clearly favored Ter Petrosian through its tendentious<br>
coverage."  Additionally, the Organization for Security and<br>
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) admitted that television air-time<br>
allotted to Ter Petrosian had far exceeded the air-time available<br>
to all other candidates put together.  The OSCE also noted concern<br>
over numerous blatant local voting irregularities by the<br>
authorities, although an OSCE preliminary report stated that these<br>
factors "did not significantly affect" the election's outcome. <br>
Other Western monitors reported that they witnessed widespread<br>
fraud.<br>
<p>
23-24 September: The opposition states that they have substantial<br>
evidence of voting fraud and massive ballot rigging and claim a<br>
national return of at least 60 percent for Manoukian, who they term<br>
as the legitimate president-elect.  The opposition, barred from<br>
state-run television and radio and denied a hearing before the<br>
Central Election Commission, accuse the authorities of carrying out<br>
a virtual coup d'tat through falsification of the returns and vow<br>
to resist the results through peaceful mass protests.<br>
<p>
23-25 September: Opposition demonstrators, for three straight days,<br>
hold massive rallies with over 100,000 participants outside the<br>
parliament building which houses the offices of the Central<br>
Election Commission (CEC).  On the 25th, after reports circulate<br>
that Vazgen Manoukian and others had been arrested while trying to<br>
file a petition for a recount with the CEC, a small group of<br>
demonstrators push open the parliament gates and enter the grounds. <br>
The security forces, already on hand along the parliament's<br>
perimeter and equipped with full riot gear, react by firing upon<br>
the unarmed crowd, killing at least one person and wounding at<br>
least fifty-nine.  In the chaos of the incident, parliamentary<br>
chairman Babken Ararktsian and his deputy Ara Sahakian are<br>
physically assaulted by a several individuals.  President Ter<br>
Petrosian holds emergency meetings with his top ministers and<br>
issues orders banning all movement into the capital and deploying<br>
tanks and armored personnel carriers throughout the city's main<br>
intersections and thoroughfares.<br>
<p>
26 September: Meeting in an emergency session, the Armenian<br>
parliament votes to lift parliamentary immunity for opposition<br>
deputies in order to initiate criminal charges of treason,<br>
terrorism and an attempted seizure of power.  Parliamentary<br>
immunity is revoked for opposition candidate Vazgen Manoukian and<br>
seven other opposition deputies by a vote of 155-0 with two<br>
abstentions.  Several of the opposition deputies, attending the<br>
parliamentary session, are physically assaulted and beaten during<br>
the session in front of the television cameras broadcasting the<br>
parliament's meeting to the nation.  In Yerevan, tanks with escorts<br>
of special riot police patrol the streets and, with the assistance<br>
of plain clothes police units, roughly disperse any and all groups<br>
of citizens on the streets.  Acting on the president's orders,<br>
Armenian security forces arrest several hundred leading opposition<br>
leader and members throughout the country.  Manoukian is reportedly<br>
in hiding as security officers seek to arrest him.<br>

MONTHLY CHRONOLOGY<br>
<p>
1 September: Abkhazian President Vladislav Ardzinba announces new<br>
parliamentary elections for November 23, 1996.  The current<br>
Abkhazian legislature was elected in early 1992 but has been<br>
hampered by the loss of its Georgian deputies who fled to Tbilisi<br>
during the worst part of the Abkhazian conflict in 1992-1993. <br>
These deputies established their own pro-Georgian body in Tbilisi<br>
in an attempt to form a parliament-in-exile.<br>
<p>
3 September: Foreign Minister Menagrashvili holds a news conference<br>
upon his return from a three day visit to Ukraine.  He reports that<br>
Ukrainian officials have announced their intention to dispatch<br>
cease-fire monitors to Abkhazia and, if the United Nations Security<br>
Council approves, a detachment of Ukrainian peacekeeping forces to<br>
the region.  Additionally, it is revealed that among the Georgian<br>
delegation were the commander of Georgian land forces, Major<br>
General Guzhar Kurashvili, and the border troops commander, Major<br>
General Valery Chkheidze.  The Georgian military officials met with<br>
their Ukrainian counterparts to formalize a preliminary agreement<br>
providing for Ukrainian assistance in the restructuring of the<br>
Georgian army.  The Ukrainian officials, including president Leonid<br>
Kuchma and Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko, promise to support<br>
the Georgian claim to some of the naval vessels of the former<br>
Soviet Black Sea fleet in order to patrol and protect the Georgian<br>
coastline.<br>
<p>
6 September: The chairman of the South Ossetian parliament, Lyudvig<br>
Chibirov, announces his government's decision to form a South<br>
Ossetian presidency and to introduce presidential rule in the<br>
region.  The South Ossetian parliament schedules a special session<br>
for September 13 to formalize the governmental restructuring and to<br>
alter the South Ossetian constitution accordingly.<br>
<p>
7 September: In response to the decision by the South Ossetian<br>
parliament to form a new presidential system of government,<br>
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze announces that the South<br>
Ossetian move unilaterally undercuts the understandings previously<br>
reached with parliamentary chairman Chibirov at their recent<br>
meeting in Vladikavkaz.  The Russia and the Organization for<br>
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) issue separate statements<br>
warning that this decision endangers the recent progress toward a<br>
political solution to the conflict.<br>
<p>
7 September: Georgian defense ministry officials announce an<br>
agreement with Germany allowing for the military training of 15<br>
Georgian officers in an annual military exchange program.  This<br>
follows the Georgian parliament's ratification of an earlier<br>
Georgian-Turkish military cooperation agreement with stipulations<br>
for the exchange of military equipment and hardware, joint military<br>
exercises and cooperation in the military production sector.<br>
<p>
8 September: Abkhazian President Vladislav Ardzinba announces that<br>
a referendum will be held next month on the question of<br>
independence.  Georgian government officials have expressed their<br>
opposition to the parliamentary elections in Abkhazia scheduled for<br>
November 23rd. <br>
<p>
9 September: Georgian Defense Minister Lt. General Vardiko<br>
Nadibaidze and Uzbek Defense Minister Colonel General Rustem<br>
Ahmedov hold a joint press conference to announce that Georgia and<br>
Uzbekistan will not join a military coalition of the Commonwealth<br>
of Independent States (CIS).  The two ministers, having completed<br>
two days of talks, also announce a new bilateral agreement on<br>
military cooperation and partnership.  The Georgian-Uzbek military<br>
agreement calls for the reciprocal use of each country's airfields<br>
and bases, as well as the sharing of military technical services<br>
and training facilities.<br>
<p>
22 September:  Parliamentary elections are held for eighty seats in<br>
the Ajarian legislature.  A coalition of Ajarian parliamentary<br>
chairman Aslan Abashidze's All-Georgia Revival Union party and the<br>
Union of Georgia's Citizens party of Georgian President<br>
Shevardnadze win at least 72 of the 80 seats.  An estimated 225,000<br>
voters took part in the election which was conducted without<br>
incident.<br>
<p>
24 September: The chairman of the South Ossetian Council of<br>
Ministers, Vyacheslav Gaborayev, is dismissed from his post by the<br>
South Ossetian parliament.  The move is seen as the latest<br>
development in the rivalry between Gaborayev and the parliamentary<br>
chairman, Lyudvig Chibirov.<br>

MONTHLY CHRONOLOGY<br>
<p>
1 September: In the latest complication over the transportation<br>
issue of the expected initial oil from the international project to<br>
develop the offshore Caspian Sea reserves, Russian officials reveal<br>
that several sections of the Baku-Grozny-Novorossiisk pipeline have<br>
been damaged from the fighting in Chechnya and due to numerous<br>
illegal attempts to siphon oil from the pipeline.  The pipeline<br>
through Chechnya is essential to the multi-billion dollar oil deal<br>
between Azerbaijan and a consortium of Western oil companies, which<br>
plans on utilizing the route to transport the expected 32 million<br>
tons of oil over a span of seven years from the offshore Azeri,<br>
Chirag and Guneshli oil fields.  Petroleum industry experts<br>
estimate that the pipeline route requires some $55-60 million in<br>
financing to modernize and upgrade the pipeline to allow for the<br>
secure shipment of oil from Baku to the main Russian facility at<br>
the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk.  Although officials of the<br>
Azerbaijan International Operating Company (the operating arm of<br>
the international consortium) are exploring a secondary route<br>
utilizing a pipeline through Georgia, analysts report that the<br>
Georgian pipeline is damaged in over two thousand separate sections<br>
and would require over $245 million to repair and modernize the<br>
pipeline to become fully operational. <br>
<p>
2 September: The vice-president of the Azerbaijani state oil<br>
company SOCAR announces that new negotiations will begin shortly<br>
with Iranian energy officials to launch a joint Azeri-Iranian<br>
venture to drill new offshore oil wells in the Caspian Sea. <br>
According to Azerbaijani officials, the joint venture will consist<br>
of a 51 percent share for SOCAR and 49 percent for the Iranian<br>
National Oil Construction and Engineering Company (INOCEC).<br>
<p>
4 September: The British company Ramco announces that it has plans,<br>
jointly with the international Price Waterhouse firm, to develop<br>
the offshore Muradkhanly deposits, one of the Caspian Sea's largest<br>
reserves.  Ramco is already an active participant in the consortium<br>
of international oil companies formed to develop the offshore<br>
Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli fields. <br>
<p>
4 September: Russian foreign ministry Special Ambassador Fyodor<br>
Kovalchuk arrives in Baku to meet with senior Azerbaijani officials<br>
to review the problematic disagreement between the two countries<br>
over the legal status of the offshore oil reserves in the Caspian<br>
Sea.  The Russian government is seeking to include all states<br>
bordering the Caspian in an attempt to gain collective sharing<br>
rights over all energy reserves in the Caspian Sea.  Azerbaijan<br>
naturally insists on retaining the exclusive right to develop the<br>
oil fields.<br>
<p>
5 September: The Azerbaijani Supreme Court sentences a former<br>
associate of ousted President Ayaz Mutalibov, Adyl Gadzhiev, and<br>
Kenan Gyurel, an Austrian citizen of Turkish origin, to 14 and 15<br>
year prison terms respectively for their part in the coup attempt<br>
of March 1995.  President Geidar Aliyev has long accused former<br>
president Mutalibov, in exile in Moscow, of plotting his overthrow.<br>
<p>
6 September: The vice-president of the Japanese State Oil Company,<br>
Satasi Tono, announces that his group is interested in increasing<br>
Japanese investment in developing Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea energy<br>
reserves.  Japanese officials have revealed that nearly twenty<br>
Japanese corporations are exploring multi-billion dollar investment<br>
deals in the Azerbaijani energy sector.  A leading Japanese firm<br>
has been the Itochu Oil Company which recently acquired the share<br>
of the U.S. McDermott company in the international consortium and<br>
has further increased its share by another 4 percent with the<br>
purchase of Pennzoil's shares as well.  Another large Japanese oil<br>
concern, Mitsui, has offered the Azerbaijan state oil company SOCAR<br>
$1 billion in an effort to obtain the right of sole, exclusive<br>
development of a promising oil field along the Caspian Sea shelf. <br>
Additional Japanese investment is being considered for the<br>
modernization and development of Azerbaijan's petrochemical<br>
industries, pipeline facilities including the route through<br>
Azerbaijan to Georgian port terminals along the Black Sea, and the<br>
country's construction and communications sectors.  To date,<br>
Azerbaijan has received some $5 billion in various aid projects<br>
making Azerbaijan the leading recipient of Japanese aid of all<br>
former Soviet states including even Russia.<br>
<p>
7 September: The political council of the ruling "Yeni (new)<br>
Azerbaijan" political party releases a statement calling for a<br>
special session of the parliament to review the conduct and<br>
performance of parliamentary speaker Rasul Guliyev.  The political<br>
council, the leadership body of President Aliyev's party, is said<br>
to be investigating charges of the speaker's misconduct and<br>
corruption.  This development, directed against the second most<br>
powerful political figure in Azerbaijan, is the latest in a fairly<br>
comprehensive governmental shakeup which began with the dismissal<br>
of the prime minister last month.  The dispute between the<br>
president and the parliamentary speaker is reportedly over the pace<br>
of economic reforms, with the president and his economic advisers<br>
advocating a slower, more restrained course in contrast to the<br>
speaker's calls for more radical reforms for the Azerbaijani<br>
economy.<br>
<p>
9 September: In an extraordinary session of the Azerbaijani<br>
parliament chaired by President Geidar Aliyev, parliamentary<br>
chairman Rasul Guliyev resigns from his post amid accusations of<br>
corruption and a sharp internal dispute over the pace of economic<br>
reforms.  By a vote of 98-8 with four abstentions, the 110-seat<br>
legislature accepts the resignation. The resignation signals the<br>
victory of the chief presidential economics adviser, Vahid Ahundov,<br>
who strongly advocates a slowing of economic reforms and<br>
privatization.  This conflict is said to have first erupted during<br>
last month's negotiations with the International Monetary Fund<br>
(IMF) over the terms of IMF assistance to Azerbaijan.  President<br>
Aliyev has increasingly favored slower reform in order to ease the<br>
social effects of the IMF's austerity plan.  The outgoing<br>
parliamentary chairman is offered the post of Azerbaijani<br>
ambassador to Norway as an attempt to both marginalize the powerful<br>
chairman and to ease tensions over his departure. <br>
<p>
10 September: Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Hasan Hasanov, in<br>
comments on the recent situation in northern Iraq, announces<br>
Azerbaijan's support for Turkey's decision to establish a military<br>
"security zone" in the Kurdish area of northern Iraq.  Baku also<br>
states that it supports Turkey's "right to take every measure" to<br>
preserve its territorial integrity.<br>
<p>
11 September: The Organization for Security and Cooperation in<br>
Europe (OSCE) Special Envoy Frank Lambach meets with Azerbaijani<br>
officials in Baku.  The meeting reviews the current Azerbaijani<br>
position regarding the Nagorno Karabagh conflict and discusses the<br>
results of last month's meeting in Germany between the Armenian and<br>
Azerbaijani presidential advisers.<br>
<p>
11 September: Azerbaijan announces the formation of a new<br>
international consortium, the Caspian International Oil Company<br>
(CIOC), empowered to exploit and develop the offshore reserves of<br>
the "Karabagh" sector of the Caspian Sea.  The CIOC is the second<br>
international consortium and is established on the terms of a<br>
November 1995 agreement and expects a United States investment of<br>
$35,000 in early 1997.  The new consortium comprises the Russian<br>
state oil company Lukoil, holding a 32.5 percent share, the U.S.<br>
company Pennzoil and the Italian firm Agipa, each with a thirty<br>
percent stake, and the Azerbaijani state oil company SOCAR, with a<br>
7.5 percent share.  Initial offshore exploration will be launched<br>
shortly in the Karabagh field, eighty kilometers south of Baku. <br>
The Karabagh oil field is expected to contain some 85 million tons<br>
of oil and 18 billion cubic meters of natural gas.<br>
<p>
12 September: The World Bank announces that it is to extend a $5<br>
million loan package to the Turkish state oil and gas company BOTAS<br>
to undertake a feasibility study of the projected annual export of<br>
some 45 million metric tons of crude oil from Azerbaijan and<br>
Central Asia.  The World Bank is interested in exploring the<br>
possible transit routes from Baku to the Turkish port facilities at<br>
Ceylon on the Mediterranean Sea.  The projected routes would either<br>
transit Armenia or Georgia, or possible Azerbaijan-Armenia-<br>
Nakhichevan.<br>
<p>
16 September: President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan signs<br>
with Azerbaijan a treaty of bilateral relations, a series of ten<br>
inter-governmental accords, and a joint statement on the<br>
international legal status of the offshore reserves and resources<br>
of the Caspian Sea.  The Caspian Sea statement calls for further<br>
negotiations between the Caspian's littoral states.  President<br>
Nazarbayev also expresses interest in participating in the project<br>
to construct a "Transcaucasian" railway line connecting the<br>
transport networks of Georgia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and<br>
Turkmenistan.<br>
<p>
27 September: The Japanese Itochu Corporation announces that it is<br>
to open an office in Baku to coordinate its planned investment in<br>
the Azerbaijani energy sector.  According to the company's general<br>
manager in Baku, Kotaro Morishita, the investment is the latest<br>
element in the new Japanese focus on the Transcaucasus.<br>

MONTHLY CHRONOLOGY<br>
<p>
1 September: Azerbaijan's presidential adviser Vafa Guluzade states<br>
that a peaceful solution to the Karabagh conflict may be found<br>
soon.  The comment by the Azerbaijani official follows his recent<br>
meeting with Armenian presidential adviser Jirair Libaridian in<br>
Frankfurt, Germany.  According to Guluzade, Armenian government<br>
officials are anxious to reach a solution to the Nagorno Karabagh<br>
conflict due to their "economic difficulties" and because the<br>
Armenian government is convinced that neither an annexation of the<br>
Republic of Nagorno Karabagh by Armenia nor international<br>
recognition of the independence of the republic is possible.  News<br>
reports quote Libaridian as stating that a draft agreement<br>
currently being prepared by the Armenian government would satisfy<br>
Azerbaijan.  Republic of Nagorno Karabagh representation is notably<br>
absent from these talks. <br>
<p>
2 September: During a special session of the Karabagh parliament<br>
commemorating the fifth anniversary of the unilateral declaration<br>
of independence and establishment of the Republic of Nagorno<br>
Karabagh, a resolution is passed calling for a new presidential<br>
election to be held on November 24, 1996.  Current President Robert<br>
Kocharian, elected as the republic's first president, is serving a<br>
temporary term which expires in December 1996.  According to the<br>
new Law on Presidential Elections, the new president will serve for<br>
a five-year term. Presidential candidates are required to gather a<br>
minimum of 1500 signatures of support in at least four of the six<br>
districts of the Republic of Nagorno Karabagh.  The Nagorno<br>
Karabagh Central Electoral Commission states that official<br>
registration for the presidential race will begin on October 10th. <br>
An Armenian delegation led by Prime Minister Hrant Bagratian<br>
attending the commemorative parliamentary session is welcomed by<br>
parliamentary chairman Artur Tovmassian. <br>
<p>
2 September: The Nagorno Karabagh government issues a statement<br>
refuting recent allegations leveled by Azerbaijani Prosecutor<br>
General Eldar Hasanov accusing Karabagh of engaging in the<br>
production and smuggling of narcotics. The Karabagh statement<br>
alleges that it is Azerbaijani that is suspected by the<br>
international community of narcotics trafficking and that the<br>
Stepanakert government remains committed to assisting in all<br>
efforts to combat the drug trade.<br>
<p>
3 September: Armenian deputy Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian, in<br>
an interview with a visiting reporter, states that the recent peace<br>
plan between Russia and Chechnya is a viable precedent and fair<br>
model for settling the Nagorno Karabagh conflict.  According to the<br>
Armenian official, the Chechen plan, negotiated by Russian national<br>
security adviser Aleksandr Lebed, sets forth a five-year cease-fire<br>
to be followed by a national referendum within Chechnya on the<br>
region's political status.  Other officials of the Armenian foreign<br>
ministry predict that greater international mediation efforts will<br>
be underway once the presidential election in Armenia is completed. <br>
The deputy foreign minister added that his government expects<br>
serious progress on the long series of mediation talks and predicts<br>
a final solution within the next two years.<br>
<p>
4 September: Representatives of the International Committee of the<br>
Red Cross announce that shipments of 120 tons of wheat seed will be<br>
provided to eight needy villages in Nagorno Karabagh's Mardakert<br>
district.  The Red Cross also plans to continue its humanitarian<br>
aid program with a particular focus on providing clean drinking<br>
water to villages in the Hadrut and Mardakert districts. <br>
<p>
9 September: Nagorno Karabagh parliamentary chairman Artur<br>
Tovmassian meets with Armenian Prime Minister Hrant Bagratian to<br>
discuss parliamentary cooperation and to review problems related to<br>
the visit of Armenian parliamentary chairman Babken Ararktsian to<br>
Stepanakert.<br>
<p>
10 September: According to officials of the International Committee<br>
of the Red Cross, there are some 50,000 land mines present within<br>
the Republic of Nagorno Karabagh.  Red Cross officials warn of the<br>
danger to residents posed by these unseen fatal hazards and report<br>
that during 1994-1995, over 24 percent of those wounded in Karabagh<br>
were victims of these land mines.  The reconstruction of the<br>
infrastructure of Nagorno Karabagh is seriously hampered by the<br>
presence of the land mines and its remains a daunting humanitarian<br>
priority.<br>
<p>
16 September: The vice chairman of the Nagorno Karabagh parliament,<br>
Boris Aroushanian, announces his resignation from his post for<br>
unspecified reasons.  The parliament accepts the resignation<br>
without naming a replacement.<br>
<p>
17 September: Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe<br>
(OSCE) German representative Frank Lambach and U.S. Ambassador<br>
Joseph Presel conclude meetings with Nagorno Karabagh officials in<br>
Stepanakert.  The OSCE officials held meetings with Karabagh<br>
President Robert Kocharian and were given a tour of the republic.<br>
<p>
18 September: According to a report of the head of the Nagorno<br>
Karabagh migration office of the Refugees Department, Lilia Kalian,<br>
a total of 40,000 thousand refugees have recently returned to<br>
Karabagh.  The total number of refugees who fled or were forced<br>
from their homes due to the Karabagh conflict are estimated at<br>
360,000.<br>
<p>
19 September: The vice speaker of the British House of Lords, Lady<br>
Caroline Cox, arrives in Nagorno Karabagh for her 29th visit in the<br>
last six years to deliver 20 tons of humanitarian aid for the<br>
Karabagh population.  Lady Cox, with assistance from the<br>
International Christian Solidarity organization, is to complete<br>
another humanitarian mission early next year with a shipment of<br>
Christmas presents for refugee children.<br>
<p>
20 September: Nagorno Karabagh officials announce that a new<br>
comprehensive privatization program is being readied for<br>
implementation shortly.  The new certificate-based privatization<br>
program is aimed at expanding the government's market economic<br>
reforms in the republic.<br>

<h1>Russia in the Transcaucasus, or Democracy in a State of Emergency</h1> 
<pre>
by Hikmet HADJY-ZADEH

Hikmet Hadjy-zadeh is one of the 
founders of the Popular Front of Azerbaijan. 
He worked as chief editor of the Popular 
Front Newspaper "Svoboda," he was also Deputy 
Prime-Minister and ambassador to Russia during 
the term  of Elchibay's government(92-93). 
At  present he is the head of the analytical 
centre of the Musavat party.

The difficulties of establishing stable democracy in Central and East 
European countries, freed from  communism, given rise to various 
research works and papers on the problem.

In many of these papers the authors, following the well-known philosophy 
that the cause of every phenomenon should be found in itself, come to 
the conclusion that these people are not ready for democracy.  At the 
end of report, concerning military coup d'etat that overthrew 
democratically elected government of Azerbaijan (summer 1993) "Time" 
magazine quotes one of the citizens of Baku: "We are given freedom, but we 
do not know what to do with it."  A similar quotation is set forth in the 
"Financial Times," in a report about  falsification during Parliamentary 
elections in Azerbaijan (November 1995): "The voters say they have 
got freedom only they do not know what to do with it." The striking 
resemblance of these quotations makes me think that there is a 
stereotypical view at work in the thoughts of Western magazine editors.

Of course we are not ready to accept the democracy as would have been 
desired.  But to what extent? Then to what extent are our failures to 
establish stable democracy determined by the above unreadiness? Are 
not there some other reasons? Why do the scholars and observers pay 
so little attention to the induced instability in our countries?

It is  well known that tension imposed on the country from outside 
often results in the growth of separatism, ethnic nationalism and 
paternalism. Democracy cannot successfully develop in a condition of 
a permanent state of emergency, in which we found ourselves because 
of our geographical location -- we are too far from God and too near 
to Russia.

It could be argued that western observers in trying to ignore the 
above issue are trying to evade the answer to the following  
question: "What is to be done and why don't we help them?" Of course 
it is so simple to say "we do nothing, because they are not ready and 
there is nothing to help them with."

"THE EVIL IMPIRE"  IS REVIVING, WHAT IS TO BE DONE?

...In the short term the main task of the West towards Russia is not 
to clear up the prospects of democracy in this country, but to define 
if Russia will become national state or restore its empire status." 
Zbigneiw Brzezinski

In 1994 public opinion in the West was seriously concerned for the 
first time by the fact that the democratic wave on the territory of 
the former USSR began to go down and the pro-imperial public attitude 
was intensified by the failure of the supporters of independent 
pro-western policy at Presidential  elections in Ukraine . Although 
president Kuchma, who won the presidential elections maintained a 
policy of independence for the Ukraine, we could see the extend  of 
resistance to this policy  within the country  as well as pressure 
coming from outside which  he had to overcome. Then there was another 
warning: the communists in Boleros came to power and declared openly 
the necessity of reconstituting the USSR. They also called for 
necessity of opposing NATO.

However the backlash to democracy and expansion of neo-imperialism on 
the territory of the former USSR began before. It took only a year 
for imperialistic forces in Russia to overcome the shock, caused with 
disintegration of the USSR in 1991. Since the autumn of 1992 Russia 
(its force ministries and especially General Staff of Russian Army) 
started making the situation unstable almost unintentionally, without 
working out a clear foreign policy and then exercised  harsh military 
pressure into the affairs of the Commonwealth of  Independent States 
(CIS) countries, with the aim of reconstructing its  influence upon 
them. Armenia practically has lost its independence,  Georgia, 
Moldova, Azerbaijan and Ukraine are oppressed and the republics of 
Middle Asia and Kazakhstan are in permanent fear for their future. Of 
course, the longing for freedom in these countries was replaced by 
longing for safety.

The end of 1993 was marked by impressive success of adherence to the 
idea of Russian Super Power and socialist economy. It brought the 
victory to communists and nationalists at parliamentary elections in 
Russia.  In 1994 - 1996 this tendency became stronger and brought a 
great success (some 40%) to the supporters of this idea at 
parliamentary elections in December 1995 and the presidential 
election in 1996 (41%).

Even the representatives of the reformative wing of the political 
elite in Russia headed by Yeltsin have to repeat the ideas of the 
supporters of the empire about the greatness of Russia and its 
special interests.

These expansionist ambitions are restricted not only to the territory 
of the former USSR. Today "admirers of the former greatness" work out 
actively the idea of "After Byzantine space,"  where Russia must 
prevail. Further and further they turn their eyes towards the Balkans 
and Middle East. These people are not looking for space to 
co-operate, to be engaged in commerce or to exchange ideas; they want 
a space to dominate or to have so-called "Lebensraum" (Space for the 
living -- germ.), an expression well known since before Second World War.

Today it is clear that the "Evil Empire" is reviving regarding its 
policy toward CIS and that this is going on with the silent connivance of the West. There is no need to remind that such policy finally makes America pay twice, when Russia will take control of CIS without any hindrance.

RUSSIAN AMBITIONS REGARDING CIS

How does Russia itself formulates its national interests and foreign 
policy problems in CIS? Today, when Russian society has gained a 
certain amount of freedom of information, this is easy to see  even 
from sources published officially as well as from the quite frank 
statements of high-ranking Russian politicians.

1. Western countries at present have lost their ability to maintain 
an active foreign policy and they are busy now with domestic affairs. 
USA devotes a lot of attention to its domestic affairs, Europe is 
busy with the Maastricht process, Germany has the problems of uniting 
its divided territories. So there will not be any special resistance 
to Russian expansion in the CIS. However the West has enough 
resources to unleash a new cold war in which Russia will be defeated 
again.

2. At the same time, Russia can hardly keep from taking advantage of 
the weakness of some of the CIS countries in order to entirely return 
its unrestrained influence over them, to use their resources, to 
seize their markets, to deprive them of the possibility of choosing 
their own way of integrating themselves into the economic and 
political systems of the world.

"Integration with a great number of states of the former USSR... or 
(in the case of their disintegration) with regions that broke away 
from them is almost inevitable in strategic prospect. There is no way 
out of this and the only problem is in its forms and conditions," -- 
as was confirmed in the "Theses of the Council on Foreign and Defense 
Policy" (1993), headed by some famous Russian political leaders:  
A.Adamishin (at that time first Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, 
(at present he is the ambassador to Great Britain ), D.Rewrikov 
(Yeltsin's assistant for foreign policy issues), S.Stepashin (then 
the Head of Federal Security Service ), S.Shakhray (then Deputy Prime 
Minister of Russian Federation) and others.

3. However Russia should not overestimate its abilities in 
maintaining the political stability and economical situation in CIS 
countries -- as they consider in the Kremlin. The mistakes of the 
USSR mustn't be repeated, which was broken down because of trying to 
help all the republics to develop simultaneously. Russia needs the 
time to "accumulate strength" to assure the well-being of its people 
first.

4. Russia considers that at present there are only two ways to solve 
the problems of the CIS:

a)    Unification with these countries or with their regions into a 
federate state;

b)  Russia is now hampered by economical crisis and it will be a 
costly enterprise to form the federate state of out of CIS countries 
that would in addition set Western countries against Russia. It seems 
to be more pragmatic to choose a policy of keeping the formally 
independence of CIS in exchange for unlimited access to their resources, their markets, stocks and services for the creation of an effective defense  union and insuring single legal space for all national minorities.

(From the "Theses" of Foreign Policy Council")


In the highest strata of Russian government there are supporters of 
the first as well as the second way of "integration" of the countries 
of the former USSR. These two ways for the "Russian type to 
integration" promise to cause much suffering for the countries that 
have chosen independence. They will abandon democracy because of 
their permanent state of emergency and they will be isolated from the 
whole world. Western countries will then witness a State that is 
again rising from ruins, which is great not because of its economical 
or cultural achievements but due to its aggressive aspiration for 
conquest.

THE INTENTIONS OF RUSSIA IN THE TRANSCAUCASUS.

Submit to a new reality -- the independent policy of former vassal 
states and to leave Caucasus alone? Never! The imperial thought that 
was restored very quickly in the heads of Russian politicians 
dictates quite another thing to them. "If we leave the Caucasus, 
others will come:  Turks, Americans... And no matter who comes, the 
Transcaucasian republics will be lost for us." Why it does not strike 
their minds that the idea of  "coming ..." and " leaving" makes no 
sense at the threshold of the 21 century, the century of democracy, 
with the disappearance of frontiers and unification efforts all over 
the world.

There are no changes can be seen in Russian policy in Transcaucasus 
after the victory of Yeltsin on president elections in 1996.   The President  himself and his renovated team are forced to keep the same course on the "Russian type to integration" according to pro-imperial public attitude.


ARMENIA

Having gained a victory over Azerbaijan in alliance with Russia, 
Armenia fell under the military, political and economical dependence 
of Russia.  It is not possible for Armenia to carry on military 
operations in the territory of Azerbaijan without Russian support. At 
the same time the present administration of Armenia cannot abandon 
its policy of expansion because it has come to power under slogans, 
proclaiming the  annexation of Karabakh to Armenia. Besides, the 
Armenian industry  today is not able to develop without deliveries of 
oil and raw materials from Russia as it always got the subsidies from 
the budget  of USSR. According to the facts given in the Moscow's 
free press, Russia pays 57% of Armenian`s budget (as "Segodnya" 
newspaper reported in the summer of 1993). Russia took from Armenia 
anything that it wanted.

As then Minister of Defense of Russian Federation, P.Grachov reported 
in an interview to the ORT TV: "Levon Ter-Petrosyan has successfully 
gone through all the trials..." (by this he means that the first 
presidents of Georgia and Azerbaijan couldn't undergo all these 
trials).

The frontiers of Armenia are guarded by Russian army. According to 
the agreement Russian military bases has settled in the territory of 
Armenia for 25 years and from these bases military operations are 
carried on against Azerbaijan that persists in objecting to the 
"Russian type to integration ."


GEORGIA

Though Russia has maintained its interests in Georgia to the fullest. 
The country was forced to join the CIS, to sign "the agreement on 
collective security of CIS" and to sign the intention record, 
according to which 3 Russian military bases will be settled in 
Vaznani, Ahalkalaki and Batumi. The latest, almost solved the problem 
of  Russia,  is to settle its naval forces on the Black Sea shore of 
Georgia in Abkhazia.

However, the overall crises is still going on in the country. Three 
hundred thousand refugees from Sukhumi, that were ravaged by Russian 
bombers, still cannot return home. Georgia has lost control over the 
South-Osetia before, which is guarded by Russian army today. Civil 
war between the supporters of the former president Gamsakhurdia and 
the current president Shevardnadze, stirred up by  Russia, rendered 
the country lifeless.  About a million people left Georgia and have 
become economical immigrants.  We can hardly speak about democracy in 
such a situation.

Russian policy makers think that it will be difficult to set active 
co-operation with Armenia without having the required dependence of 
Georgia from Russia, because Russia has no frontiers with Armenia. 
One can get there only via Georgia or Azerbaijan.

Independent Georgia and Azerbaijan serve as "a bad example" and they 
are the factors making the situation unstable in the North-Caucasian 
autonomous republics of Russia.


AZERBAIJAN

It was the first republic among CIS that during the democratic 
government of Elchibey (1992-1993) gained the withdrawal of Russian 
army and frontier troops from its territories in the spring 1993. 
Moreover, after accession to power, the government of Democrats has 
made switch in policy of the country towards the West.

Of course Russia took vengeance over Azerbaijani democrats  for 
trying to pursue the independent policy . In June 1993, Elchibay's 
government fell with Russian assistance. Just after that event 
Armenia with Russian assistance occupied four regions in the 
territory of Azerbaijan, beyond the borders of Nagorny Karabakh. It 
put former CP leader Haydar Alyev's Administration into a state of 
emergency. From September, Azerbaijan was forced to join the CIS 
being foolished  by then Defense Minister, P. Grachov, who assured 
them in his interview given to Azerbaijan TV that Russia would 
immediately help Azerbaijan to withdraw Armenian troops from the 
occupied lands. In October, after Azerbaijan had joined the CIS, 
Armenia with Russian assistance occupied two more regions in the 
territory of Azerbaijan.

Russia threatens Azerbaijan  with annexation of its lands, having the 
aim:

- getting the consent of Baku to guarding its frontiers by Russian 
frontier troops and for forming military bases on the territory of 
Azerbaijan;

- gaining that Azerbaijan will recognize Russia to be the only 
negotiator in the Karabakh conflict and to settle Russian 
"peacemaking troops" there.

- taking an active part in extraction  of  Azerbaijan oil. Moreover 
Russia put forward the problem that the oil, being extracted from the 
Caspian shelf near Azerbaijan is a common property of all Caspian 
regions.

(In the former USSR Caspian basin and its shelf has been divided 
between the republics as an internal reservoir.)

- making that oil, extracted on the territory of Azerbaijan, 
Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan will flow trough the pipe-line, passing 
through the territory of Russia; otherwise Russians think they will 
lose control over these countries.

Furthermore, Azerbaijan is of great strategic value for Russia. A 
glance at the map will be enough to understand that in the territory 
of the former USSR all the railways from Russia to Iran and to 
oil-bearing fields of the Persian Gulf lie through Azerbaijan .

The independent democratic Azerbaijan will be the attractive example 
for Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Tadjikistan, the 
countries trying to resist Russian control.

Russia could not make yet Azerbaijan agree with the requirements 
given above. How long can Azerbaijan stand against Russia without any 
support from the West? If Armenia will go on occupying district after 
district on the territory of Azerbaijan then, Haydar Alyev has 
nothing to do but to accept the suggested "Russian type to 
Integration." Also it will be difficult for the Democrats to suggest 
an alternative to society.


THE OPPORTUNITIES RUSSIA HAS IN AZERBAIJAN

Russia has some other opportunities, besides the Karabakh crisis, to 
exert influence over Azerbaijan.

a) About 40% of the commodity turnover in Azerbaijan belong to 
Russia. The Russian frontiers, recently closed, as a result of the 
Chechnya conflict, which drove the economy of Azerbaijan into a 
desperate state.

b) There are 300 000 ethnic Russians in Azerbaijan. Russia uses them 
as a ground for interference, though all their, cultural rights were 
guaranteed already by Elchibey's Decree, "About the rights of ethnic 
minorities."

c) Russia takes an active part in stringing up the separatism of the 
Lezghins, who live in the North of the republic and the Talish 
people, who  live on the South. Lately, Russia and Armenia try to 
raise the question of the Kurdish people in Azerbaijan. Armenian 
propaganda alleges that most regions in Azerbaijan, occupied by 
Armenians are places of compact residence of Kurdish people, who are  
in favor of Armenia.

d) The representatives of the former Communist nomenclature are also 
pro-russian. This well-arranged force, associated with financial, 
commercial and industrial groups, headed by former president 
A.Mutallibov (who has gotten Russian shelter), is the main hope of 
Russia.

e) Since the USSR period, the Russian espionage system, has been 
distributed for 70 years by KGB, Army Security Service and Frontier 
troops of the former USSR.

From the evaluations of the Ministry of National Security Service of 
Elchibey's Administration about 100 000 people in any case were 
linked with the USSR Secret Services in Azerbaijan. A great number of 
adherents to Russia are in the supreme officer's corps of the 
Azerbaijan Army.

Iranian secret services are also intensifying their efforts in 
Azerbaijan.  At the time of the Democrats' government, about 100 
Iranian agents and citizens of Azerbaijan, recruited by Iranian 
secret services, were arrested as a result of  the efforts of the 
Ministry of National Security Service. It is clear that the aims of 
Russia and Iran are almost the same.

Fundamentalist Iran, more than Russian imperialists, does not want to 
see the Open Society near itself, considering that about 20 million ethnic Azerbaijani Turks living in Iran..


THE PROSPECTS OF DEMOCRACY IN THE AZERBAIJAN

Military coup d'etat inspired by Russia in the summer 1993 struck a 
blow to democracy in Azerbaijan. According to the "Freedom House" 
reports on Human Rights, Azerbaijan from the "Partly free country" in 
1993 has become the "Not free country" in 1994 and 1995. In spite of 
the mass arrests of the democrats, informal veto on occupation for 
them, and severe censorship it was impossible to turn back society to 
Stalinism. As the result of an unceasing three-year political 
struggle, the democratic community of the country gained the 
government recognition of the existence of opposition political 
parties and partly free mass media. The most happy thing is that the 
present government had to renew the foreign policy adopted by 
democrats which towards independence and integration with the 
democratic world community.

Embassies of democratic countries, especially the US Embassy gave 
indispensable help to the democrats in their struggle for existence.  
This demonstrated that there are no bounds for democrats, that morale 
support can be affective and it is possible to struggle against 
dictatorship by peaceful means...

Obviously, without support of the world democratic community 
Azerbaijan won't stand long against Russia and Iran. The loss of 
Azerbaijan for the West means the loss of future prospects for a 
successful struggle against Russian expansion on the South, against 
Iranian fundamentalism, the possibility to support the democratic 
processes in the republics of Central Asia, and naturally the loss of 
markets in these countries.

It should be explained to the Russian government that Russia won't be 
able to become a full member of democratic community (The Country of 
the Seven, European Council and others) if it continues a 
neo-imperialistic policy towards its neighbors.

Support the democrats and defenders of independence in CIS countries? 
The answer is yes! They should be given a hand. They need help in 
establishing contacts with the global system of democratic 
organizations. They need intellectual and technical support. Their 
intellectual community subdivisions need  help in making contacts 
with the intellectual centers of the West.

The situations with Human Rights in these countries have to be 
closely watched. The present Azerbaijani administration should be 
informed by the Western community that they will not communicate with 
regimes violating Civil and Political Rights.

It is necessary also intensify the spread of democratic values, of 
world coexistence and the advantages of market economy in Russian 
Society.  Russians have lost very quickly the guilt complex gained 
during the years of Perestroika for the injustices of 70 years of 
communist imperialism toward individuals as well as to the whole 
nations.

The efforts and means needed for all that are 1000 times less than 
for keeping the stability of national financial system in countries 
sliding to despotism...

How ready were we for democracy during the time of Elchibey's 
administration? The estimate of the experts of the European Bank 
(EBRD) in their report published on March 1993 is as follows:

"Azerbaijan with regard to the work that was done in the orientation 
toward market economy, as well as establishment of multi-party system 
and democracy, to the economic potential and mental ability of the 
population is one of the most prepared countries of the former USSR 
which have already started to carry out the economic reforms."

Then this is the report of the Parliamentary  elections in 1995, 
written together with  the Joint Mission of UN-OSCE.

"...Violation during pre-election campaign casts doubts on democracy 
of the election." "...Elections do not answer the world standards."

At the same time,  a conclusion of great importance for us made by 
the Joint Mission, is as follows:

"...Azerbaijan is able to hold elections true to international 
standards."

Yes, we are able to do it, only if they leave us alone.

" DEUTCH WAVE" BY THE CASPIAN SHORE"

    According to the agreement reached by the Azerbaijan National Televisiion and
Radio Company  and German "Deutch Wave"  some programs of the "Deutch wave"
will be broadcated to Azerbaijan. The  head of Russian Language department in
"Deutch wave" Mr. M.Zorichin is to visit our country.
    The "Deutch Wave" programs are broadcasted from a multistore building in a
suburb of Keln. Recently, great changes have taken place there. Regarding the
changes Mr. Diter Vairikh  answered some of our questions
D.V."In a short period of time we have adopted the latest technology achievmnets
in information and media sector. Now, the modern equipment is used. This is the
reason of an advance in our work. In the past we could broadcast only on
short waves, but now we are using satellite services. In the present,the number
of the progams, broadcasted on short waves has reached 39. Whereas, 20 per
cent of our listeners are being served using the satellite communication services.
This kind of service is employed only by us and CNN . A large number of changes
took place in "Deutch Wave" television company as well. The programs now are
broadcasted 24 hours a day. Most of them are broadcated in German(12 hours),
some - in English (10 hours), and only a little - in Spanish (2 hours).
The quality has improved as well.

    Q.What are you planning to change in broadcasting to the C.I.S. ?
    D.V.The former Soviet Union always listened to us as to a voice of free world.
But since the economic reforms started there, we have been trying to propogand
the democratic reforms. At the moment, programs in Russian are broadcasted 6
hours a day. And a flow of listeners' letters proves the fact  that the interest
in our programs continues to grow. Telemagazine "Western Europe" to about 70 local
tele and radio companies. For now because of financial problems  we can not
connect the C.I.S.to the cabel network.
   Q. How do you plan to improve the relations with the C.I.S. countries?
   D.V. We will  work in diferent directions. First, we should try to have  all
European programs, not only ours, to be retransmissed by the C.I.S.
telecompanies. Second, we will employ the people interested in German.The
number of such kind of people is amounted to 10 million. Last, we will increase
the number of programs on economic issues. More joint programs are planned.
Moreover,we will use the video tapes to improve the economic knowledge of our
employees.
   Q.Do you mean the seminars by corespondence?
   D.V.No , not at all. In order to increase the professionalism of our journalists
we have educational units in Berlin and Keln. Many C.I.S and East European
jounalists are invited every year


THE MEDIA IN AZERBAIJANI LANGUAGE IN GEORGIA

    In the present, one can find media editions in various, apart from Georgian,
languages: Russian, Azerbaijani, Armenian, Abkhazian, Osetian, German, Greek,
Kurdian and Hebrew.Most of the present publications has been published since
1920s. Due to the collapse of the U.S.S.R. and formation of independent Georgia
completely new newspapers started their publication. Among them there are the
papers of different societies, parties and organisations. In this article we
will try to elicudate the newspapers published in Azerbaijani language.

    Azeris

    According to the population survey, carried out in 1989, azeri population in
Georgia was nearly 1 mln people. They mostly concentrated in the south-east
Georgia (Dmanisi, Bolnisi, Marneuli, Gardabani districts}. Some of them live in
the capital - Tbilisi City, and others- in the main industrial cities like
Sagajero and Rustavi. They are mostly employed in agricultural sector and are
one of the major suppliers of agricultural goods to Tbilisi and Rustavi.
    Azeri residints of Georgia managed to hold on to their national traditions and
customs. There are many schools in south-eastern Georgia where  education is
given in Azerbaijani language. There is the Azerbaijani lanaguge school in the
Tbilisi Pedagogical University. One of the most popular organisations in Georgia
is Cultural and Charity centre " Birlick"  on behalf of which  paper "Gurjustan"
is publisheed

    Periodicals

    "Gurjustan"
    The newspaper was found in 1921,First it was called " Yeni Fikir" and
then "Soviet Gurjustan". At the moment, it comes out once a week  with the total
edition of 1000. The A-3 formated 4-page paper is totally financed from
the local budget and  has its rask to interprete the chronics of the events
taking place in the country's political and social life.
    The method of linotype is still used. Modern equipment has been
ordered from Baku but has not been delivered yet, the paper' journalists
said.
    Being unable to pay for the sevices of the state press disrtibutor "Matsne"
the paper's management is responsable for its distribution. All they can do is
to supply every single edition of the paper to the local press kiosks
    A huge attention is given to agricultural issues. That is why among people the
paper is called " Agricultural encyclopedia". Nowadays the readers are more
interested in  legislation on land than in weather forecasts, the papers editor
said.
    "Gurjustan" is also keen to teach its readers Georgian because the Georgian
language was not taught in Azerbaijani schools.
    Recently the paper started to publish the articles on religious  and
multinational issues Freuquently the materials on Nagorny Karabakh are
published.
   Due to the financial problems the wages of the paper's emloyees are very low.
The chief editor gets $12 a month

   " Marneuli "

   "Marneuli", a paper of the Local Executives organs  is published once a week.
The articles in Azerbaijani are placed on one of its pages. They are mostly the
translation of the rest of materials in the paper published in Georgian.

   Papers published in Azerbaijani before the collapse of the S.U. are:
   "Sangori"            Gardabani
   "Gelebe Bayragi"     Bolnisi
   "Trialeti"           Dmanisi
   They stopped their publishing in 1990.

   The Azeris, emmigrated from Georgia to Azerbaijan,  united in different
societies( "Borjali", "Garachop" and others) The objective of these societies
was to help its members  to settle down in Baku  and   they published a number
of papers and magazines ("Sabah", "Borjali" and others). However, the financial
problems and changes in socio-political situation in the country made them to
stop their activity

   Radio

   Every day for half an hour ( 19.30 - 20.00) the Georgian National Radio company
broadcasts  programs in Azerbaijani language. These programs tell its listners
about the socio-political events, taking place in the country and about culture
news.After what teh various entertaining programs are on the air.
   In opinion of local residents, the most comfortable mean to get a great deal of
information is the radio. The reason for that is a shortage in electroenergy and
the fact that the country population is unable to watch television.

    The media services in Armenian language in Georgia

    Armenian residents in Georgia can get education in Armenian as well as Azeri can.
There are 256 Armenian schools in Georgia.Moreover there is  the Armenian
language department in the Tbilisi Pedagogical Unversity and the Armneian Opera
Theatre in Tbilisi. Armenians mostly live in Samtskhe-Javakheti district and
thier total population in Georgia is amounted to 300,000.

edition of 200,000. The price  for A-3 formated 8-page edition is $0.2. in its

Organisation and the Armenian President's apparat, is used.

MEDIA AS A MEAN OF "BRAIN WASHING"

    The poll carried out by one of the sociology services was to determine what
the readers of national press are interested in. Despite the fall of people's
real income the economic issues such as economy and business are in fifth
(21percent) and tenth (7,5 percent) places respectivevily. The political matters
most interesting for Azerbaijani readers - 57 percent  - are at the top of the
table:
   Theme                    Percentage
1.Politics                  57
2.War issiues               34,5
3.Entertainment             30,1
4.Foreign affairs           25
    The interest in politics demonstrates that the people are quite aware of the
the government's role in  illimination of any possible economic problems.
Therefore the government's attitude  to media is not surprising at all. The
governemnt realises that because of the censorship, a fall of peole's real
incomes ,a rise in prices  the only mean of getting information which can be
afforded by the population is radio and television. Moreover,it is established
that 97 percent of population still use home equipment which was produced in the
Soviet Union and unable to recieve FM waves And as a sequence,the private
telecompanies are allowed to  broadcast only on FM waves.
in freuqent mode.
    The example for what we said is the way the people were kept informed during the
parlaimentary elections: the censors' self willed activity against the canditates
from the opposition: the "sudden" electrycity cut when these canditates were on
TV.
    The EU Mass Media Institute was supervising the parlaimentary elections in
Russia,Georgia and Azerabijan.In general,the interpretation of election process
in Russia and Georgia met the requirement of the Institute. .But that can not be
said about Azerbaijan. The Institute representatives noted, that the press in
Azerbaijan for past two years had been under the pressure, set by the Government.
    How is the "brain washing" working in Azerbaijan?. According to the survey, only
13.6% of respondents believe in what they see on TV and read in the newspapers,
23.8% expressed thier partial believe in the mass media, and 34.5% reckon that
broadcasted information is trustworhless.It is a little to believe to the official
data  on the results of the elections reporting that more than two thirds supported
the perty in the power.In UN and ESCO represantatives noted that the international
requirements were not met during the election and election campaign in Azerabijan.
    In these conditions it is not surprising that 25-35% of the population is rather
to get information from the Russian television programs. Meanwhile 13 and 4,8 %
of the population are preferring to whatch first and second progams of Azerbaijan
television.Concernig the radio 30% expressed their preference to Russian "Mayak"
against only 8% who preffer the National Radio.
